The Christian Heritage Party of Canada, also referred to as CHP Canada, It believes "the purpose of civil government is to ensure security, freedom, and justice for all its citizens from conception till natural death, by upholding just laws".
This socially and fiscally conservative party held its founding convention in Hamilton, Ontario in November 1987, where Ed Vanwoudenberg was elected its first leader.  Jim Hnatiuk led the party from 2008 to early 2014, and David J. Reimer is the interim leader as of 1 February 2014. Protestant political parties: a global survey  (2004) p 56
The party nominated candidates for the first time in the 1988 federal election, and ran numerous candidates in the 1993 and 1997 elections. It was unable to field 50 candidates in the 2000 election and was consequently de-registered by Elections Canada, the government elections agency. The party was re-registered in time for the 2004 election.
Many of its founders had been members of the Social Credit movement. The party hopes to "apply proven Judeo-Christian principles of justice and compassion to Canada's contemporary public policy needs". The party claims that it seeks to represent all Canadians, and specifically denies any interest in converting all Canadians to Christianity. As of the 2011 election, the party has yet to obtain a seat in the House of Commons.

Platform

The Christian Heritage Party seeks to avoid a narrow platform, but rather implements the policy that "civil government is to ensure freedom and justice for a nation's citizens by upholding law and order in accordance with Biblical principles."
Some of the key goals and principles of the CHP are:

In the 1988 federal election, Gray ran in his first election under the Christian Heritage Party banner in the electoral district of Fraser Valley East. On election night, he placed fourth out of six candidates with over eight percent of the popular vote, finishing well behind Progressive Conservative incumbent Ross Belsher.
Gray has since run for the CHP in every general election, with the exception of 1993.  He has also contested four byelections, including one in Calgary Southwest against Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper, who later was elected to serve as prime minister of Canada.

Gray became the party leader in 1995. His leadership was confirmed at three subsequent CHP conventions. He stepped down in November 2008. Near the end of 2006, a human rights complaint was filed against Ron Gray alleging communication via the Internet, messages likely to expose homosexuals to hatred or contempt.  BY October 24, 2008, the complaint had been dropped and the file closed by the Canadian Human Rights Commission.

He became deputy leader of the party in 2005 and was elected leader at the party's November 2008 convention in London, Ontario defeating Harold Ludwig and Rod Taylor on the first ballot of the party's leadership convention.
Due to a difference in understanding on the leader's mandate to innovate in membership qualifications, and a motion by the national board to ask that the leader put promotion of his vision on hold until a full board meeting could discuss the vision, Hnatiuk submitted his resignation as leader effective 1 February 2014, though choosing to continue as a party member.
