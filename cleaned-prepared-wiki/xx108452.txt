History

The project to establish the school was announced in 1977, during Jordan's Silver Jubilee celebrations of King Hussein's accession to the throne, as a tribute to His Majesty's development efforts, especially in the field of education. In 1984, Queen Noor accepted responsibility for the as yet unrealized project, and a year later it became one of the major undertakings of the newly established Noor Al Hussein Foundation.
After being temporarily housed in a Ministry of Education building, the school opened its doors in 1993 to eighty-nine ninth graders admitted for their academic achievement. In 1997 the school celebrated its first graduating class. In 1995, H. M. King Hussein laid the cornerstone for the first phase of the construction of the school's permanent home in Yajouz outside Amman, and in early 1998 the school moved from its temporary site to its permanent place.
In 2000, the ownership of the Jubilee School for Gifted and Talented Students was transferred from the Noor Al Hussein Foundation to the newly established King Hussein Foundation as its first project in the area of education and leadership.

Financial status

Because it's a non-profit organization and runs over a huge campus, the Jubilee School faces some financial issues. The school depends on charity and governmental support to run, and depends on donations in form of computers and lab equipment.en.edu.aspx?tabid=84 Nevertheless, Jubilee school doesn't reject new applicants who can't afford the total fee which is 3000 Jordanian Dinars (about $4300 or â‚¬3300). Instead, it estimates fees for each student based on their parents' financial status.
