The Universal Edit Button is a green pencil icon in the address bar of a web browser that indicates whether a web page on the World Wide Web (most often a wiki) is editable. It is similar to the orange "broadcast" RSS icon (16px) that indicates that there is a web feed available. Clicking the icon opens the edit window. It was invented by a collaborative team of wiki enthusiasts, including Ward Cunningham, Jack Herrick, and many others. The concept was first conceived during the 2007 RecentChangesCamp in Montreal. After the next RecentChangesCamp, coding began by Travis Derouin, Brion Vibber and other programmers, the button was officially launched on June 19, 2008.

Description

The Universal Editing Button (UEB) is intended to enable an internet user to quickly recognize when a website — such as a wiki — may be edited. According to the UEB's creators, "it is a convenience to web surfers who are already inclined to contribute, and an invitation to those who have yet to discover the thrill of building a common resource. As this kind of public editing becomes more commonplace, the button may become regarded as a badge of honor. It serves as an incentive to encourage companies and site developers to add editable components to their sites, in order to have the UEB displayed for their sites."
Tim Berners-Lee's initial vision for the web was a read-write medium.

Implementation

The plug-ins on a browser side recognize the specific form of the alternative link specification in HTML fragment:Documentation, how to implement the button on the server side
The href part tag species the edit page that corresponds with the page being viewed. Every server that is capable and willing to support the user editing can include this fragment and this way enable the button. Hence the button support can be relatively easily added to various web applications if the source code is available. The tag does not put any requirements on the details about the editing session itself and simply brings to the page where the user would also come by clicking on Edit tab (or similar). The button is normally used in the user editable pages, so no maintainer-only credentials should be asked to start a valid editing session. If only registered (logged in) users can edit, the button should bring to the register/login form.
Plug-ins are currently available for Firefox,Firefox plug-in Opera,Opera plug-in Epiphany,Epiphany plug-in page and ChromeChrome plug-in page (there is ongoing work to support Internet ExplorerProject page, dedicated to Internet Explorer support).

History

Conversations on this idea started at RoCoCo (a RecentChangesCamp) in Montreal in 2007, and discussions continued on the AboutUs wiki.org At the Palo Alto RCC in 2008, a handful of people explored the idea, got excited about the ability to have the button automatically detected by browsers, and helped spread the idea.
