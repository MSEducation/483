[[Expander graph]]

CATEGORIES: Graph families

In combinatorics, an expander graph is a sparse graph that has strong connectivity properties, quantified using vertex, edge or spectral expansion as described below. Expander constructions have spawned research in pure and applied mathematics, with several applications to complexity theory, design of robust computer networks, and the theory of error-correcting codes.

Definitions

Intuitively, an expander is a finite, undirected multigraph in which every subset of the vertices "that  is not too large" has a "large" boundary. Different formalisations of these notions give rise to different notions of expanders: edge expanders, vertex expanders, and spectral expanders, as defined below.
A disconnected graph is not an expander, since the boundary of a connected component is empty. Every connected graph is an expander; however, different connected graphs have different expansion parameters. The complete graph has the best expansion property, but it has largest possible degree. Informally, a graph is a good expander if it has low degree and high expansion parameters.

Edge expansion

The edge expansion (also isoperimetric number or Cheeger constant) h(G) of a graph G on n vertices is defined as
where the minimum is over all nonempty sets S of at most n/2 vertices and ∂(S) is the edge boundary of S, i.e., the set of edges with exactly one endpoint in S.1 in 

Vertex expansion

Spectral expansion

It is known that λn = −d if and only if G is bipartite. In many contexts, for example in the expander mixing lemma, it is necessary to bound from below not only the gap between λ1 and λ2, but also the gap between λ1 and the second-largest eigenvalue in absolute value:
Since this is the largest eigenvalue corresponding to an eigenvector orthogonal to u, it can be equivalently defined using the Rayleigh quotient:
where 

Relationships between different expansion properties

The expansion parameters defined above are related to each other. In particular, for any d-regular graph G,
Consequently, for constant degree graphs, vertex and edge expansion are qualitatively the same.

Cheeger inequalities

When G is d-regular, there is a relationship between h(G) and the spectral gap d − λ2 of G. An inequality due to Tanner and independently Alon and Milman
This inequality is closely related to the Cheeger bound for Markov chains and can be seen as a discrete version of Cheeger's inequality in Riemannian geometry.
Similar connections between vertex isoperimetric numbers and the spectral gap have also been studied:See Theorem 1 and p.156, l.1 in . Note that λ2 there corresponds to 2(d − λ2) of the current article (see p.153, l.5)

Constructions

There are three general strategies for constructing families of expander graphs.g.,  The first strategy is algebraic and group-theoretic, the second strategy is analytic and uses additive combinatorics, and the third strategy is combinatorial and uses the zig-zag and related graphs products.

Margulis-Gabber-Galil

Then the following holds:

Ramanujan graphs

Lubotzky, Phillips, and Sarnak (1988), Margulis (1988), and Morgenstern (1994) show how Ramanujan graphs can be constructed explicitly.12 of  By a theorem of Friedman (2003), random d-regular graphs on n vertices are almost Ramanujan, that is, they satisfy

Applications and useful properties

The original motivation for expanders is to build economical robust networks (phone or computer): an expander with bounded valence is precisely an asymptotic robust graph with number of edges growing linearly with size (number of vertices), for all subsets.
Expander graphs have found extensive applications in computer science, in designing algorithms, error correcting codes, extractors, pseudorandom generators, sorting networks (). In cryptography, expander graphs are used to construct hash functions.
The following are some properties of expander graphs that have proven useful in many areas.

Expander mixing lemma

More formally, let E(S, T) denote the number of edges between S and T. If the two sets are not disjoint, edges in their intersection are counted twice, that is,
Then the expander mixing lemma says that the following inequality holds:
where λ is the absolute value of the normalized second largest eigenvalue.

Expander walk sampling

The Chernoff bound states that, when sampling many independent samples from a random variables in the range 1, with high probability the average of our samples is close to the expectation of the random variable.  The expander walk sampling lemma, due to , states that this also holds true when sampling from a walk on an expander graph. This is particularly useful in the theory of derandomization, since sampling according to an expander walk uses many fewer random bits than sampling independently.
