History

Bristol County was created by the Plymouth Colony on June 2, 1685,Bristol County, Massachusetts, USA and named after its "shire town" (county seat), Bristol.  The Plymouth Colony merged into the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1691.  
The towns of Bristol, Barrington, and Warren were awarded to Rhode Island in 1746 as part of a long-running boundary dispute (see History of Massachusetts), forming Bristol County, Rhode Island.  At the same time, Cumberland, Rhode Island was carved out of Attleborough, Massachusetts and annexed to Providence County, Rhode Island; Tiverton and Little Compton were transferred to Newport County, Rhode Island.  East Freetown was officially purchased by Freetown, Massachusetts, from Tiverton in 1747, and so remained on the Massachusetts side.
After the departure of Bristol, Taunton was made the shire town of the county.  A second county courthouse was constructed in 1828 in the growing town of New Bedford (designed a "half-shire town").  In 1862, part of Seekonk (now East Providence, Rhode Island) and the entirety of East Pawtucket were transferred to Providence County, Rhode Island.  At the same time, land ceded from Rhode Island was added to Fall River and Westport.  The growing Fall River became the site of the third county courthouse in 1877. J.W. Lewis and Co., 1883.    p. 1.

It is also to note that Bristol, Plymouth and Taunton are all places in South West England. Their Massachusetts cousins were named after the originals as South West England was the focal point for sailing and descovery at the time of Americas discovery. John Cabot set sail from Bristol and sailed down the Severn on which lies Newport over in Wales. He then stumbled across mainland U.S.A.
