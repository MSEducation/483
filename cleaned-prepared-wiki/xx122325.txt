History

There were two distinct villages named Kirkby and Fleetham at one time. Both are mentioned in the Domesday Book as Cherchebi and Fleetha both belonging to the lands of Count Alan of Brittany. The nearby hamlets of Gt and Lt Fencote are referred to in the Fleetham entry as the Fencotes. The lands of Fleetham before the Norman Conquest were owned by Gamli, son of Karli and Uhtred. After 1086 the manor was granted to Odo the chamberlain. The lands around Kirkby remained with Aldred (Eldred) throughout that time period.
The manor of Kirkby was passed to Aldred's son Gospatric, whose daughter Godareda succeeded to his lands, but a clear line if succession does not emerge again until William Giffard in the thirteenth century, whose mesne lordship subsequently lapsed. The demsne titles were then in th epossession of the Stapleton family until 1514 when Sit Thomas Metham let the lands to the Conyers. The heirs of the Methen family sold the manor in 1600 to Leonard Smelt. On the death in 1740 of Leonard Smelt, the M.P. for Northallerton, the manor passed to the Aislabie family, who via the distaff side held it until 1845. At the turn of the twentieth century it passed to the Courage family.
The manor of Fleetham passed to the Scrope family of Castle Bolton in the thirteenth century. It was passed down that line of descent via Lord Fauconberg and the Darcy family until 1670 when it was conveyed to Richard Smelt, younger brother of the then lord of Kirkby, thus uniting the two manors.

Notable buildings

Kirkby Fleetham Hall

Kirkby Fleetham Hall is a grade II* listed 18th-century country house which stands a mile to the north of the village. The property was bought in the 1720s by John Aislabie (1670–1742), MP for Ripon and Chancellor of the Exchequer, for his son William Aislabie, also MP for Ripon. The present house was built in the mid-1700s by William for his daughter, Ann Sophie, who had married William Lawrence. Subsequently, it was left (with property in Clint), by William's granddaughter, Miss Sophia Elizabeth Lawrence (1761–1845), to her second-cousin once-removed, Harry Edmund Waller III, JP, DL (1804–1869), thence to his son Edmund Waller VI (1828–1898), who sold it in 1889 to Edward Courage of the Courage brewing family. Since then much of the estate has been sold off. The hall has gone through several disguises including hotel and "country retreat".  It is currently privately owned with part let out as apartments.
