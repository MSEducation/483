[[List of DOS commands]]

CATEGORIES: DOS commands, Microsoft lists, Computing commands, Lists of computer terms

This article presents a list of commands used by x86 DOS operating systems.  Other DOS operating systems are not part of the scope of this list.
In the PC operating systems MS-DOS and PC DOS, a number of standard system commands were provided for common tasks such as listing files on a disk or moving files.  Some commands were built into the command interpreter, others existed as external commands on disk. Over the several generations of DOS, commands were added for the additional functions of the operating system. In the current Microsoft Windows operating system a text-mode command prompt window can still be used.

Command processing

The command interpreter for DOS runs when no application programs are running. When an application exits, if the transient portion of the command interpreter in memory was overwritten, DOS will reload it from disk. Some commands are internal and built into COMMAND. When the user types a line of text at the operating system command prompt, COMMAND. If no match is found, an error message is printed and the command prompt is refreshed.
External commands were too large to keep in the command processor or were less frequently used. Such utility programs would be stored on disk and loaded just like regular application programs but were distributed with the operating system. Copies of these utility command programs had to be on an accessible disk, either on the current drive or on the command path set in the command interpreter.
In the list below, commands that can accept more than one filename, or a filename including wildcards (* and ?), are said to accept a filespec parameter. Commands that can accept only a single filename are said to accept a filename parameter. Additionally, command line switches, or other parameter strings, can be supplied on the command line. Spaces and symbols such as a "/" or a "-" may be used to allow the command processor to parse the command line into file names, file specifications, and other options.
The command interpreter preserves the case of whatever parameters are passed to commands but the command names themselves and filenames are case-insensitive.
While many commands are the same across many DOS systems (MS-DOS, PC DOS, DR-DOS, FreeDOS, etc.) some differ in command syntax or name.

Internal - DOS 2.0 and above
 
 CLS

DR-DOS supports a similar function also during CONFIG.SYS directive).
In MS-DOS and PC DOS, COMMAND. In DOS Plus and DR-DOS, COMMAND.SYS driver could be detected. If so, they will instead send the ANSI control sequence ESC [ 2 J to clear the screen to the attached console. To support other terminal types or control various screen settings after a CLS, the sequence to be sent can be changed by using the reserved environment variable $CLS. Due to the difficulties to define environment variables containing binary data COMMAND.COM accepts a special \nnn notation for octal numbers. For example, to send an alternative control sequence like ESC + (for 1Bh 2Bh as used by ASCII terminals), one could define the variable as follows:
This feature is also supported by the command interpreters in Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS and REAL/32, with the difference that they have built-in terminal drivers, will never fall back to call BIOS functions, and will default to VT52 rather than ANSI control sequences by default (e.g. ESC E).
