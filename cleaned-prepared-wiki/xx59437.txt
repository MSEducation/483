History

Ancient history

The name Amka is thought to preserve that of Beth Ha-Emek, a city mentioned in 

During the Crusades

During the Crusader period, it was referred to as Amca. In 1283, it was mentioned as part of the domain of the Crusaders during the hudna between the Crusaders based in Acre and the Mamluk sultan al-Mansur (Qalawun).

Ottoman period

In 1596, 'Amqa was a village in the Ottoman nahiya (subdistrict) of Akka  under the liwa' (district) of Safad, with a population of 215. It paid taxes on a number of crops, such as wheat, barley, olives, cotton and fruit, and on other types of  produce, such as goats and beehives.Hütteroth, Wolf-Dieter and Kamal Abdulfattah (1977), Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century. Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband 5. Erlangen, Germany: Vorstand der Fränkischen Geographischen Gesellschaft. p. 192. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 4
In the early 18th century the village was under control of Shaykh Najm. He had an agreement to sell the cotton from this and other villages under his control exclusively to the Dutch trader Paul Maashook. In return, Maashook would pay the "miri" tax normally payable by the village shaykhs.12. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 93. The Arab traveller al-Bakri al-Siddiqi, who toured the area in the mid-18th century, said that he prayed in the village after visiting the citadel of Atlit.4 In 1776 the village was used as a base by Ahmad Jazzar Pasha to crush a revolt led by Ali, one of the sons of Zahir al-Umar. 93. Cohen, 1973, p. 94.
In the late 19th century, the village was described as being built of stone, situated on a slight rise in a valley, surrounded by olive and fig trees, and arable land. There were an estimated 300 Druzes living there. Later, the residents  were described as  Muslims who maintained a village mosque. In 1887, the Ottoman authorities built a school in ´Amqa.

During the British Mandate

At the time of the 1931 census, Amqa had 212 occupied houses and a population of 895 Muslims..
Depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war,Khalidi (1992), p 5 all that remains of the Arab village structures are an elementary school for boys, founded under Ottoman rule in 1887 and one mosque.
The majority of the surviving Arab buildings of Amqa were completely destroyed by the Israeli army in the late 1950s on the orders of the Israeli government.177Torstrick Rebecca L. (2000) The Limits of Coexistence: Identity Politics in Israel University of Michigan Press, ISBN 0-472-11124-8 p 180 The mosque and a schoolroom now used as a warehouse, are the only surviving buildings. 93

Within Israel

The village was captured by Israel's 7th Brigade on July 16, 1948 during Operation Dekel. It was largely destroyed, with the exception of its school and its mosque, and most of its inhabitants were expelled, with the exception of its former Druze inhabitants who still live nearby. Some of the inhabitants remained in Israel as present absentees. On 1 March 1949 a UN observer reported villagers from 'Amqa amongst a large group of people expelled by the Israeli Army which arrived at Salim in the West Bank. He also noted other villagers from 'Amqa in a group expelled on 26 March. Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation, and the Countdown to the Suez War. Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-827850-0. pp.146.147 In February 1950, the village was declared a closed area. The Arab population remained under Martial Law until 1966.
A group of Yemenite Jewish immigrants were settled in Amka in 1949.

Archeological sites

Three khirbats ("archaeological ruins") lay within Amka's vicinity and contain the foundations of buildings, well-chiseled building stones, presses, and a cistern. During archaeological searches of the area remnants of a Byzantine church were discovered but due to the destruction of the village no foundations could be established.178The War for Palestine (second Edition 2007) Rogan and Shlaim Cambridge University Press ISBN 978-0-521-87598-1  p 66Khoury, Elias (2007) Gate of the Sun: Bab Al-Shams Translated by Humphrey Davies Macmillan, ISBN 0-312-42670-4 p 308
The Amka mosque was inspected by Petersen in 1991. The date of the mosque construction is not known, but it bears a general similarity to the nearby mosque of Al-Ghabisiyya, and is probably of a similar age, i.e. early 19th century.
