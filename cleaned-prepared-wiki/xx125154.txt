The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) is a network of the world's megacities taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.org/about, accessed 2013-03-04 C40 harnesses  the assets of member cities to address climate risks and impacts locally and globally.
C40 has grown to 63 members under the tenure of C40 Chair, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, who served as the elected leader of the organization from 2010-2013, followed on 15 December 2013 by Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes.C40 Announces New Leadership and Funding Milestones,  We Do For Cities,  accessed 2014-04-10 With a focus on collaboration to excel climate actions, C40 has established ten networks across seven initiative areas with a global staff to support collaborative problem solving, promote the exchange of programs and policies developed by cities, and facilitate targeted peer-to-peer dialogue among city staff.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/c40-climate-change-cities-collaboration, accessed 2013-03-04
Through these efforts, C40 aims to demonstrate that cities are significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and hopes to provide proven models that other cities and national governments can adopt.org/why_cities, accessed 2014-04-10 In the words of C40 Chair Michael Bloomberg, "While international negotiations continue to make incremental progress, C40 Cities are forging ahead. Collectively they have taken more than 5,000 actions to tackle climate change, and the will to do more is stronger than ever. As innovators and practitioners, our cities are at the forefront of this issue – arguably the greatest challenge of our time."'C40Home,  accessed 2013-03-04

History

The organization started in October 2005 when the former mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, convened representatives from 18 megacities to pursue action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.org/history, accessed 2013-03-05 The meeting resulted in an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by taking action on a number of points, most notably procurement policies and alliances to accelerate the uptake of climate-friendly technologies. This agreement began what later became known as the C40 Climate Leadership Group.
In 2006, Mayor Livingstone and the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI)—lead by the efforts of former U.S. President Bill Clinton—combined to strengthen both organizations, bringing the number of cities in the network to 40 and helping to deliver world-class projects and project management for participating cities to further enhance emissions reductions efforts.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/c40-climate-change-cities-collaboration, accessed 2013-03-05
Serving as C40's first Chair, Mayor Livingstone established the C40 Secretariat in London, set up the C40 Steering Committee, and initiated the use of C40 workshops to exchange best practices amongst participating cities. In 2008, former Mayor of Toronto David Miller took over as C40 Chair. Highlights of his tenure included the Copenhagen Climate Summit for Mayors and the C40 Cities Mayors Summit in Seoul, both in 2009, as well as the launch of practical action initiatives for cities, such as the C40-CCI Climate Positive Development Program and the Carbon Finance Capacity Building program.
The tenure of current C40 Chair, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes, began in December 2013, following the 2010-2013 Chairmanship of the Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg. Key milestones in 2011 include the full integration of the CCI Cities Program into the C40, the C40 Cities Mayors Summit in Sao Paulo, the release of two reports developed in collaboration with the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and Arup Group Limited, and the announcement of two new partnerships with the World Bank and Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI). Key milestones in 2012 include the first-ever cataloging of mayoral/municipal authority over various city assets, the release of a draft edition of the Global Protocol for Community-scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions to harmonize emissions measurement and reporting across cities, strengthening C40's partnership with the World Bank to better enable cities in developing parts of the world to drive local climate action,2012 in Review: Cities Commit to (and are achieving) GHG Reductions,  Under Mayor Bloomberg's leadership, C40 has grown to include 63 cities.

Membership

While C40 originally targeted megacities for their greater capacity to address climate change, C40 now offers three types of membership categories to reflect the diversity of cities taking action to address climate change. The categories consider such characteristics as population size, economic output, environmental leadership, and the length of a city's membership.org/media/press_releases/press-release-c40-announces-new-guidelines-for-membership-categories, accessed 2013-03-05
1. Megacities
2. Innovator Cities
3. Observer Cities
Megacities make up the core of C40's membership, with 42 cities currently in this category across developed and developing regions. As such, megacities retain sole access to C40 leadership and governance opportunities, such as serving as C40 Chair, as members of the C40 Steering Committee and the C40 Board.
