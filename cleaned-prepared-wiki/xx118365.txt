The following music singles are from the anime series The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya sung by the voice actors for the three main female and two main male characters in the series along with four other supporting female characters, making the total number of character albums nine in all. The first three released included songs by Aya Hirano as Haruhi Suzumiya, Minori Chihara as Yuki Nagato and Yuko Goto as Mikuru Asahina. Moreover, two additional character CDs were released on December 6, 2006, sung by Yuki Matsuoka as Tsuruya and Natsuko Kuwatani as Ryōko Asakura. Two more character CDs were released on January 24, 2007, sung by Sayaka Aoki as Kyon's Sistercdjapan.co.cdjapan.co.
Each of the nine singles feature the ending theme song "Hare Hare Yukai". Other than the three main female character's versions which are solo cover versions of the original, there are some alterations. For Tsuruya's version as well as Ryōko's version, the lyrics were changed to fit the character; Tsuruya's version contains her catch phrase "nyoro", while Ryōko reverses the optimistic lyrics to convey futility and destruction. However, while Tsuruya's and Ryōko's versions have the same arrangements as the original version, the last four released have their arrangements changed along with the lyrics. Kyon's Sister's version is very upbeat; Emiri's version is very fact-based; Itsuki's version talks about his ESP; and Kyon reflects about his now-disturbed life in his version.
