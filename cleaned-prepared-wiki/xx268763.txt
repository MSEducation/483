Cvent, Inc. is a publicly held software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that specializes in meetings management technology. The company offers web-based software for meeting site selection, online event registration, event management, email marketing, and web surveys. 

History

Cvent was founded in September 1999 by Reggie Aggarwal. That same year it received $17 million in venture capital and grew its staff to 125 employees. Following the dot-com bubble burst and the September 11 attacks, Cvent faced near-bankruptcy and was forced to cut 80% of its staff.
The company became profitable again by 2003. In 2011, Cvent was growing by 50% a year and received $136 million of funding from New Enterprise Associates in July 2011, which, at the time, was the largest investment in a U.S. software company since 2007. 
In 2012, Cvent entered the mobile market with the acquisition of two event application developers. On June 13, Cvent announced its acquisition of Austin-based startup Seed Labs, recently rebranded as CrowdTorch, for $4.2 million. CrowdTorch develops mobile applications for consumer-oriented events and CrowdCompass develops mobile applications for business-related events.
Cvent filed an S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 8, 2013, proposing an initial public offering of an estimated $5.6 million in shares. The company raised $117.6 million and received a market capitalization of more than a billion dollars. The IPO was referenced in regards to its use of the JOBS Act, which enabled the company to offer an IPO much more quickly.

Software and services

In July 2000 Cvent introduced its first SaaS product, a web-based tool for event planners to manage invitations and collect registration fees.
An app development tool, CrowdTorch, was launched in 2009.
