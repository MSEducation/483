The number  approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest. It can also be calculated as the sum of the infinite seriesEncyclopedic Dictionary of Mathematics 142.D
The constant can be defined in many ways; for example,  is the number whose natural logarithm is 1. There are also more alternative characterizations.
Sometimes called Euler's number after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler,  truncated to 50 decimal places is

History

The first references to the constant were published in 1618 in the table of an appendix of a work on logarithms by John Napier. was more common and eventually became the standard.

Applications

Compound interest

Jacob Bernoulli discovered this constant by studying a question about compound interest:
If the interest is credited twice in the year, the interest rate for each 6 months will be 50%, so the initial $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding $1.00×1.52 = $2.25 at the end of the year. Compounding quarterly yields $1.00×1.254 = $2.4414..., and compounding monthly yields $1.00×(1+1/12)12 = $2.613035... If there are .
Bernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit (the force of interest) with larger )

Bernoulli trials

The number  it is already 1/2.
This is an example of a Bernoulli trials process. Each time the gambler plays the slots, there is a one in one million chance of winning. Playing one million times is modelled by the binomial distribution, which is closely related to the binomial theorem. The probability of winning  times out of a million trials is;
In particular, the probability of winning zero times () is
This is very close to the following limit for :

The problem of de Montmort is to find the probability that none'' of the hats gets put into the right box. The answer is:

The simplest case of a normal distribution is known as the standard normal distribution, described by this probability density function:

 in calculus

The principal motivation for introducing the number  has derivative given as the limit:
The limit on the far right is independent of the variable  is symbolically defined by the equation:
Consequently, the exponential function with base , as opposed to some other number, as the base of the exponential function makes calculations involving the derivative much simpler.
Another motivation comes from considering the base- as the limit:
where the substitution , the limit is equal to 1. So symbolically,
The logarithm in this special base is called the natural logarithm and is represented as ; it behaves well under differentiation since there is no undetermined limit to carry through the calculations.
There are thus two ways in which to select a special number .

Alternative characterizations

Other characterizations of  are also possible: one is as the limit of a sequence, another is as the sum of an infinite series, and still others rely on integral calculus. So far, the following two (equivalent) properties have been introduced:
1. The number  is the unique positive real number such that
2. The number  is the unique positive real number such that
The following three characterizations can be proven equivalent:
3. The number  is the limit
Similarly:
4. The number  is the sum of the infinite series
where .
5. The number  is the unique positive real number such that

Properties

Calculus

As in the motivation, the exponential function  is important in part because it is the unique nontrivial function (up to multiplication by a constant) which is its own derivative
and therefore its own antiderivative as well:

Number theory

The real number  is irrational.)
Furthermore, by the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem,  is transcendental, meaning that it is not a solution of any non-constant polynomial equation with rational coefficients. It was the first number to be proved transcendental without having been specifically constructed for this purpose (compare with Liouville number); the proof was given by Charles Hermite in 1873.
It is conjectured that  is expressed in any base the possible digits in that base are uniformly distributed (occur with equal probability in any sequence of given length).

Complex numbers

The exponential function  may be written as a Taylor series
Because this series keeps many important properties for , allows one to derive Euler's formula:
which holds for all  is Euler's identity:

Representations

The number  can be represented as a real number in a variety of ways: as an infinite series, an infinite product, a continued fraction, or a limit of a sequence. The chief among these representations, particularly in introductory calculus courses is the limit

In computer culture

In contemporary internet culture, individuals and organizations frequently pay homage to the number .
For instance, in the IPO filing for Google in 2004, rather than a typical round-number amount of money, the company announced its intention to raise $2,718,281,828, which is
