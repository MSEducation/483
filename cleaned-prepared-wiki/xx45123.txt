[[Demographics of Kosovo]]

CATEGORIES: Kosovar society, Demographics by country

The demographic features of the population of Kosovo, includes various factors such as population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. The dominant ethnic group is Albanian, with significant minorities of Serbs and others.
The final results of the 2011 Census recorded Kosovo as having a population of 1,739,825 (excluding North Kosovo).Final Results of the 2011 Kosovo census

Population

The 2000 Living Standard Measurement Survey by Statistical Office of Kosovo (rejected by BelgradePeople's Daily: Belgrade to Reject Results of U.N.-Conducted Census in Kosovo): Total population estimated between 1.8-2.0 million.
Kosovo currently has the youngest population in Europe, with a fertility estimated by the Census Bureau of 2.4 children per woman.  In recent years, however, Kosovo's population growth rate has begun to slow and its birth rate has decreased.

Vital statistics

In 2009 in Kosovo were registered 34,477 births, 34,240 of them were born alive, while 237 were born dead. Ratio of dead births-fetal deaths in 1000 births was 6.9 promil. The age group of mothers was as following: 25–29 years age group with 35.1%, 20–24 years old age groups with 26.4%, age group 30–34 years with 23.3%, and other age group compose 15.2% of the total number of births. The average age of women who have children born in 2009, is 27.7 years.
Under the weight of children born in health institutions, the majority of infants with weight is 3000-3499gr. or 31.4% from 3500 to 3999 gr. 23.7%, from 2500 to 2999 gr.12.7%, etc.  Live babies born weighing less than 1000 gr. constitute only 0.3%.
Under education, mothers with primary school dominate the top with 44.9% of secondary but not tertiary and university with 7.2%, etc. Frequent names in 2009 for girls were Erza(114 times)and Suela (108 times) while for boys was the names Leon (159 times) and Leart(124 times).

Cities

Based on estimations by the Kosovo Agency of Statistics done in late 2011 and published in 2012, the total population of Kosovo is 1,794,303. With the current estimation on population, Kosovo ranks as the 150th largest country in the world based on how populous it is. Some of the largest municipalities by population in Kosovo are Pristina, Prizren, Ferizaj, Peć, Gjakova, Gnjilane and Kosovska Mitrovica. (ask (2011)).
Pristina being the capital city of Kosovo and in the mean time ranked as the largest one is also the city where the commuting phenomenon is present the most.

Ethnic groups

The official results of the censuses in Kosovo after World War II are tabulated below. The proportion of Albanians was below 70% until 1961, but increased to 81.6% in 1991. The figures for Albanians in the 1991 census were estimates only, since that census was boycotted by most Albanians. Similarly, the figures for Serbs in the 2011 census omit those in North Kosovska Mitrovica, Leposavić, Zubin Potok, and Zvečan.
The results of the census 2011 of ethnic groups in municipalities are tabulated below.
The 2000 Living Standard Measurement Survey by Statistical Office of Kosovo found an ethnic composition of the population as follows:
A most comprehensive (October 2002) estimate (for the 1.9 million inhabitants) for these years:
During the Kosovo War in 1999, over 700,000 ethnic Albanians,BBC:  around 100,000 ethnic Serbs and more than 40,000 Bosniaks were forced out of Kosovo to neighbouring Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Serbia.
After the United Nations took over administration of Kosovo following the war, the vast majority of the Albanian refugees returned.
The largest diaspora communities of Kosovo Albanians are in Germany  and Switzerland accounting for some 200,000 individuals each, or for 20% of the population resident in Kosovo.
Many non-Albanians - chiefly Serbs and Romani - fled or were expelled, mostly to the rest of Serbia at the end of the war, with further refugee outflows occurring as the result of sporadic ethnic violence. The number of registered refugees is around 250,000.. The largest concentration of Serbs in the province is in the north, but many remain in Kosovo Serb enclaves surrounded by Albanian-populated areas.

The Third Demographic, Social and Reproductive Health Survey in Kosovo

Nearly two-thirds (63.2%) live in rural areas. The overwhelming majority (94.7%) of respondents are of the Muslim religion, with Orthodox (3.9%) being the majority of the remainder

The vast majority (92.4%) of the surveyed population belongs to the Albanian ethnicity, 3.9% are
Serbian, and 1.1% are Bosnian. The remaining 2.6% are distributed across other minorities. Ethnic distributions are virtually the same for females and males.
Half of the total survey sample (50.1%) is male. Similar to the 2003 survey, distribution of
population by sex is virtually the same in both urban and rural areas – 50.1% male and 49.9%
female in urban areas and 50.2% male and 49.8% female in rural areas.
As Table 2.6 displays, school participation rates are high, especially at ages 10–14, where they reach 98 percent of the people of these ages. The lower rate (80%) at ages 5–9 can be explained by the late starting age for some pupils, though it is noticeably higher than the 66 percent in the 2003 survey (see Figure 2.8). The school attendance rate for people aged 15–19 also increased between 2003 and 2009, from 63 percent to 77 percent. School attendance rates have also increased for other age groups.
There are differences in the attendance rates between rural and urban residents as well as between males and females. Males and females in rural areas who are age 15 or older attend school at a lower rate than their urban counterparts. The school attendance gap between rural and urban residents progressively widens in relative amounts as age increases. The urban-rural gap at older ages probably reflects the scarcity of higher educational opportunities in rural areas. In both urban and rural areas, among those aged 5–14, females are slightly more likely to be enrolled in school than males, but at older age groups males are more likely to be in school than females.
Seven percent of people aged 15 years and above are unable to read and write in any language.
Figure 2.10 shows clear differences between the sexes for all age groups, especially older ones, in both urban and rural areas, with females overall being more than two times as likely to be illiterate as males (7.5% versus 3.3% in urban areas, and 11.3% versus 5.5% in rural areas). Furthermore, illiteracy is
highly correlated with age. The level of illiteracy is very low at ages between 15 and 34—less
than 2 percent—and is particularly low (0.4%) among males of this age group. However, at older
ages, the illiteracy rate increases considerably, with 22 percent of females and 9 percent of males
aged 55–64 being illiterate, and 56 percent of females and 25 percent of males aged 65 and older
not being able to read and write in any language.
The total of all sources of household income; answers were recorded in the categories seen in Table 2.13.
Table 2.13 shows the distribution of households across these income categories, for the total sample and separately for urban and rural areas. Figure 2.16 shows the urban and rural data graphically.
63% of all households in the 2009 reported that they earned 300 Euros or less monthly, 17.5 percent earned 301 to 400, 14.0 percent earned 401 to 800, and 4.7% earned more than that. People in rural areas were more likely to have monthly incomes of 300 Euros or less (66.0%) than those urban areas (58.5%), while the proportion of households earning 400 Euros or more monthly is higher in urban areas (22.3% versus 16.0%)
In 2009 there were a total of 9,896 births to female respondents age 15-49 at the time of the survey, of which 370 occurred in the 12 months before the survey. From this we can calculate the crude birth rate (CBR) for the 12 months before the survey.

Health


Harvard medical school and NATO published an interesting study on the impact of the conflict on Kosovo health system in 2014.jallc.int/newsmedia/docs/kosovo_case_study.pdf
The data in the table below are from the Kosovo Agency of Statistics.

Migration

Table 7.1 shows the percentages of persons who moved into or out of each of the seven regions of
Kosovo during their lifetimes; for each percentage for each region, the denominator is the number
of people in the survey sample who were born in the region (including those no longer living in it
but living elsewhere in Kosovo). The final column of the table shows net migration (in-migration
less out-migration), making it possible to see which regions have gained or lost population from
the process of lifetime internal migration. The table also shows the percentage of all respondents
to the 2009 KDHS who were born abroad – 1.7 percent. Altogether, 6.4 percent of 2009 KDHS
survey respondents are lifetime migrants (i.e., lived in a different region country at the time
of the 2009 KDHS from where they were born).
Pristina is the region with the highest in-migration. Nearly 11 percent of respondents now living in Pristina region stated that they were born in other regions of Kosovo (or abroad).
However, around 3 percent of respondents born in Pristina region now live in a different region of Kosovo. On net, the population of Pristina region is 7.7 percent larger because of net internal lifetime migration. Peja region has the next highest rates of migration, with lifetime net immigration of 6.7 percent. The regions of Gjakova and Mitrovica have suffered relatively large losses of lifetime migrants over the years, on net losing 6.4 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, of the people born there (who are still alive and still in Kosovo) to net out-migration to other regions of Kosovo. This is not surprising given the very poor economic prospects in these two regions, as well as the political and security issues in Mitrovica.

Religion

The results of the 2011 census gave the following religious affiliations for the population included in the census: p.62
These figures will underestimate the Orthodox percentage of the population because the areas not covered by the census have an overwhelming Serb majority.
Kosovo's constitutional status as a secular state has no significant opposition, and urban areas feel predominantly secular.
The Protestant community in Kosovo was established in the 1870s, and today the country has more than 28 Protestant Evangelical churches. Albanian Christians are much less common in Kosovo than in Albania. Very few Albanians in Kosovo are Albanian Orthodox.
The Serb population, estimated before the 2011 census at 100,000 to 150,000 persons, is largely Serbian Orthodox. The  Catholic Albanian communities are mostly concentrated in Gjakova, Prizren, Klina and a few villages near Peć and Vitina.'Muslim' Albanians return to Christianity. Published December 4, 2008.

2011 Census

The final results of the 2011 census recorded Kosovo excluding North Kosovo as having 1,739,825 inhabitants.rks-gov. The census enjoyed considerable technical assistance from international agencies and appears to have been endorsed by Eurostat; it was, however, the first full census since 1981, and not one of an uninterrupted series. The results show that there were no people temporarily resident in hotels or refugee camps at the time of the census;[ref]
 p.125[/ref] that out of 312,711 conventional dwellings, 99,808 (over 30%) were unoccupied; p.131 and that three municipalities designed under the Ahtisaari Plan - Klokot, Novo Brdo, and Štrpce to have Serb majorities in fact had ethnic Albanian majorities (although their municipal assemblies have Serb majorities).rks-gov.145

15th century

The ethnic composition of Kosovo's population during this period included Serbs, Albanians, and Vlachs along with a token number of Greeks, Armenians, Saxons, and Bulgarians, according to Serbian monastic charters or chrysobulls (Hrisovulja). A majority of the given names in the charters are overwhelmingly Serbian (Of 24,795 names, 23,774 were ethnic Serb names, 470 of Roman origin, 65 of Albanian origin and 61 of Greek origin).
The essentially Serbian composition of medieval Kosovo's population is corroborated by Ottoman defters, showing that Serbs were majority until the 17th century.

17th - 18th centuries

The Great Turkish War of 1683–1699 between the Ottomans and the Habsburgs led to the flight of a substantial numbers of Serbs and Albanians who had sided with the Austrians, from within and outside Kosovo, to Austrian held Vojvodina and the Military Frontier - Patriarch Arsenije III, one of the refugees, referred to 30,000 or 40,000 souls, but a much later monastic source referred to 37,000 families. Serbian historians have used this second source to talk of a Great Migration of Serbs. Wars in 1717-1738 led to a second exodus of refugees (both Serbian and Albanian) from inside and outside Kosovo, together with reprisals and the enslavement and deportation of a number of Serbs and Albanians by the victorious Ottomans.139-171

19th century

19th century data about the population of Kosovo tend to be rather conflicting, giving sometimes numerical superiority to the Serbs and sometimes to the Albanians. The Ottoman statistics are regarded as unreliable, as the empire counted its citizens by religion rather than nationality, using birth records rather than surveys of individuals.
A study in 1838 by an Austrian physician, dr. Joseph Müller found Metohija to be mostly "Slavic" in character.Dr. Joseph Müller, Albanien, Rumelien und die Österreichisch-montenegrinische Gränze, Prag, 1844 Müller gives data for the three counties (Bezirke) of Prizren, Peć and Gjakova which roughly covered Metohija, the portion adjacent to Albania and most affected by Albanian settlers. Out of 195,000 inhabitants in this region, Müller found:
Müller's observations on towns:
Map published by French ethnographer G. LejeanH.R. Wilkinson, Maps and Politics; a review of the ethnographic cartography of Macedonia, Liverpool University Press, 1951 in 1861 shows that Albanians lived on around 57% Kosovo while a similar map, published by British travellers G. M. Mackenzie and A. P. Irby in 1867 shows slightly less; these maps don't show which population was larger overall. Nevethless, maps cannot be used to measure population as they leave out density.
A study done in 1871 by Austrian colonel Peter KukuljDas Fürstenthum Serbien und Türkisch-Serbien, eine militärisch-geographische Skizze von Peter Kukolj, Major im k.k.Generalstabe, Wien 1871 for the internal use of the Austro-Hungarian army showed that the mutesarifluk of Prizren (corresponding largely to present-day Kosovo) had some 500,000 inhabitants, of which:
Modern Serbian sources estimated that around 400,000ISBN 86-17-09287-4: Kosta Nikolić, Nikola Žutić, Momčilo Pavlović, Zorica Špadijer: Историја за трећи разред гимназије, Belgrade, 2002, pg. 63 Serbs were cleansed out of the Vilayet of Kosovo between 1876 and 1912.
Maps published by German historian Kiepert in 1876, J. Hahn and Austrian consul K. Sax, show that Albanians live on most of the territory of what is now Kosovo, however they don't show which population is larger. According to these, the regions of Kosovska Mitrovica and Kosovo Polje were settled mostly by Serbs, whereas most of the territory of western and eastern parts of today's province was settled by Muslim Albanians.
An Austrian statisticsDetailbeschreibung des Sandzaks Plevlje und des Vilajets Kosovo (Mit 8 Beilagen und 10 Taffeln), Als Manuskript gedruckt, Vien 1899, 80-81. published in 1899 estimated:
At the end of the 19th century, Spiridon Gopchevich, an Austrian traveller - comprised a statistics and published them in Vienna. They established that Prizren had 60,000 citizens of whom 11,000 were Christian Serbs and 36,000 Muslem Serbs. The remaining population were Turks, Albanians, Tzintzars and Roma. For Peć he said that it had 2,530 households of which 1,600 were Mohammedan, 700 Christian Serb, 200 Catholic Albanian and 10 Turkish.
Note: Territory of Ottoman Kosovo Vilayet was quite different from modern-day Kosovo.

20th century

British journalist H. Brailsford estimated in 1906H. N. Brailsford, Macedonia, Its Races and Their Future, London, 1906 that two-thirds of the population of Kosovo was Albanian and one-third Serbian. The most populous western districts of Gjakova and Peć were said to have between 20,000 and 25,000 Albanian households, as against some 5,000 Serbian ones. A map of Alfred Stead,Servia by the Servians, Compiled and Edited by Alfred Stead, With a Map, London (William Heinemann), 1909. (Etnographical Map of Servia, Scale 1:2.750.000). published in 1909, shows that similar numbers of Serbs and Albanians were living in the territory.
German scholar Gustav Weigand gave the following statistical data about the population of Kosovo,Gustav Weigand, Ethnographie von Makedonien, Leipzig, 1924; Густав Вайганд, Етнография на Македония (Bulgarian translation) based on the pre-war situation in Kosovo in 1912:
Metohija with the town of Gjakova is furthermore defined as almost exclusively Albanian by Weigand.
Citing Serbian sources, Noel Malcolm also states that in 1912 when Kosovo came under Serbian control, "the Orthodox Serb population was at less than 25%" of Kosovo's entire population.

After 1961, 103,000 Serbs and Montenegrins left Kosovo, mainly due to alleged mistreatment by Albanian authorities and population.
After the province gained autonomy, the local provincial Statistical office given authority over the Census, whereas the rest of the country's Census was under the leadership of the Federal Statistical Commission. There were allegations of 'Census rigging' (for the 1971 and 1981 censuses) by Turkish, Muslim and Romani minorities who claim forceful Albanization. The Serbians claimed that the Albanians had drastically overinflated their prevalence within Kosovo. It was felt that this could not be substantiated though because the Kosovo Statistical offices were under the control of the majority Albanian population - this was against the national norm at the time, which dictated that census takers had to be of different nationalities

The corrections should not taken to be fully accurate. The number of Albanians is sometimes regarded as being an underestimate. On the other hand, it is sometimes regarded as an overestimate, being derived from earlier censa which are believed to be overestimates. The Statistical Office of Kosovo states that the quality of the 1991 census is "questionable." 
In September 1993, the Bosniak parliament returned their historical name Bosniaks. Some Kosovar Muslims have started using this term to refer to themselves since.
