Kerry Lee Wood (born June 16, 1977) is a retired American Major League Baseball pitcher. During his career he played for the Chicago Cubs, Cleveland Indians, and New York Yankees. Wood first came to prominence as a twenty-year old rookie when he recorded twenty strikeouts in a one-hit shutout against the Houston Astros, which some have argued may be the greatest single-game pitching performance in Major League Baseball history.cbssports.go. He was later named the 1998 National League Rookie of the Year. Wood would go on to record over 200 strikeouts in four out of his first five seasons, with a high of 266 in 2003, and holds several MLB strikeout records.
Though he struggled with injuries throughout his career, Wood was twice named an All-Star. Wood transitioned to a relief pitching in 2007 due to continued struggles with injuries, ultimately reviving his career as a closer. During his career Wood was placed on the disabled list 14 times in 13 major league seasons, which included missing the entire 1999 season due to Tommy John surgery. After a slow start to the 2012 season, Wood retired on May 18, 2012.foxsports.com/mlb/story/chicago-cubs-pitcher-kerry-wood-retire-051812

Early life

Wood became a phenomenon while attending MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas, for his first three seasons of high school baseball. He continued his domination of batters at Grand Prairie High School in his final season as a high school player.

Professional career

Chicago Cubs

=1995-1997=

The Chicago Cubs drafted Wood as the fourth overall selection in the 1995 Amateur Draft. He spent three years playing in the Minor Leagues. His best season in the Minors came in 1996, when he posted a 10-2 record for the Daytona Cubs.

=1998=

Wood made his first appearance in the Major Leagues on April 12, 1998. In his fifth career start, on May 6, he threw a one-hit, no walk, 20-strikeout shutout against the Houston Astros, tying Roger Clemens' record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game and breaking Bill Gullickson's single-game rookie record of 18 strikeouts in 1980.  Wood allowed only two baserunners: Ricky Gutiérrez on an infield single and Craig Biggio on a hit by pitch. Gutiérrez's single, off third baseman Kevin Orie's glove, was close enough that some fans lobbied to have it changed in scoring to an error, which would have given Wood a no-hitter. Regardless, it was one of the most dominating pitching performances in major league history, garnering a game score of 105 – the highest number ever calculated for a pitcher in a nine-inning game.
Wood finished the 1998 season with a 13–6 record; despite missing the last month of the season with elbow soreness, he easily won the National League Rookie of the Year award. He pitched one game in the playoffs, losing against the Atlanta Braves.

=1999–2003=

During spring training of 1999, Wood underwent Tommy John surgery to repair damage to the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, missing the entire season.
Wood returned in 2000 and struggled to an 8–7 record, but the following season, he returned to form. In 2001, Wood went 12-6 with a 3.36 ERA. The following season, Wood finished 12–11 with a 3.67 ERA, but perhaps more important was the fact he did not miss a start all year long, setting career highs with 213.6 innings pitched and 33 starts. He rang up 217 strikeouts in both seasons.
In 2003, Wood continued to improve, setting career highs with 266 strikeouts, 14 wins (as part of a 14–11 record), a 3.20 ERA, and two shutouts. He threw the fastest fastball in the majors among starters, averaging 95.4 miles per hour.  He also walked 100 batters and surrendered 24 home runs, also career highs, but was selected as a National League All-Star and helped lead the Cubs to the playoffs as one half of "Chicago Heat" along with fellow pitcher Mark Prior.
Wood earned two wins in the Divisional Series against the Atlanta Braves and was the starter in Game 3 of the 2003 National League Championship Series, which the Cubs won in extra innings. However, the Cubs lost in seven games to the eventual World Series champion Florida Marlins. In the decisive Game 7, Wood hit the first home run by a pitcher in an NLCS game since another Cub, Rick Sutcliffe, did so in Game 1 in 1984. However, the Marlins won the game 9-6. Wood was the losing pitcher and the Cubs were eliminated.

=2004–2006=

Wood went just 8-9 during the 2004 season and was sidelined for nearly two months with a strained triceps.
In 2005, Wood continued to struggle. On August 31, 2005, Wood underwent surgery and missed the remainder of the season. During Spring Training in 2006, Wood suffered several injuries which required an additional surgery (on his knee). On May 18, 2006, Wood returned to the Cubs' pitching rotation when he started and lost a home game against the Washington Nationals. In June, Wood returned to the DL with a sore shoulder. The following month, the Cubs announced that Wood had sustained a partially torn rotator cuff which was likely to keep him from pitching again for the rest of the year. At the end of the 2006 season, the Cubs exercised their option on Wood's contract and bought out the remaining $13M.

=2007–2008=

With his long history of injuries and inability to stay in the starting rotation, Wood accepted the Cubs' offer to return as a relief pitcher in 2007. Wood attempted to sustain a regular throwing schedule and appearances during Spring Training games. However, Wood was placed on the 15-day DL with soreness in his elbow and was then moved to the 60-day DL. Wood considered retiring if he continued to have pain in his throwing arm.
The Cubs activated Wood from the 60-Day Disabled List on August 3, causing many to believe that he would make his actual return on that day. He remained healthy appearing in 22 games and posting a 1-1 record with a solid 3.33 ERA.
He was generally limited to one inning per outing, not appearing in games on back to back days, though he did pitch in both halves of a double header on September 15. Wood was a major contributor to the Cub's NL Central Division Championship down the stretch in late September, earning a win and 8 holds. Wood filed for free-agency on November 11, 2007, though he suggested that he wanted to remain in pinstripes for the 2008 season. Despite multi-year offers from other teams, Wood agreed to a one year, $4.2 million deal with the Cubs.
Wood, along with Bob Howry and Carlos Mármol, competed for the role as the Cubs' closer after Ryan Dempster was moved to the starting rotation. After posting a 2.84 ERA in the spring, Wood won the job. He recorded his first career save April 3, 2008 with a win over the Brewers.
Wood was placed on the 15-day DL on July 24, 2008 with a blister on his right index finger.
On November 13, 2008, after acquiring closer Kevin Gregg from the Florida Marlins, Cubs general manager Jim Hendry announced that the organization did not plan on re-signing Wood.

Cleveland Indians

On December 13, 2008, Wood signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Indians.
Cubs fans showed their appreciation for him by giving him a standing ovation when the Cleveland Indians played at Wrigley Field on June 19, 2009. On July 17, 2010, Wood was placed on the disabled list for the 14th time in his major league career, this time due to a blister on his right index finger.

New York Yankees

Wood was traded from the Cleveland Indians to the New York Yankees on July 31, 2010 for Andrew Chive, Matt Cusick, and cash. During the 2010 postseason, Wood had a 2.25 ERA appearing in 7 games overall. The Yankees won the 2010 ALDS against the Minnesota Twins in 3 games but lost to the Texas Rangers in 6 games of the 2010 ALCS.
The Yankees announced on October 27 that the club had declined to exercise their option for Wood for 2011.

Second stint with the Chicago Cubs

On December 16, 2010, Wood agreed to a one-year deal worth $1.5 million with the Cubs.
On May 18, 2012, Wood retired, striking out the only (and therefore final) batter he faced, Dayán Viciedo of the Chicago White Sox. The fans at Wrigley Field gave Wood a long standing ovation as his son, Justin, ran out to greet him as he exited the field. On his baseball career: "I had fun, I had a blast", Wood said. "I wouldn't trade anything in."  Long-time White Sox play-by-play voice Ken Harrelson, who called the game that day for Comcast Sportsnet Chicago, said of Wood, "In this game you are either an asset or a liability, and this guy (Wood) was definitely an asset."

Personal life

Wood is married to Sarah Pates of Waukegan, Illinois.
While playing for the Cubs, the Woods hosted a celebrity bowling tournament called Kerry Wood's Strike Zone, which also featured a silent auction that raised over two million dollars.
On June 24, 2013, while paddleboarding in waters near Chicago, Wood happened upon a corpse floating in Belmont Harbor. He immediately reported the grisly discovery to local authorities, who determined the deceased to be a 40 year-old man who had been reported missing by a North Side nursing home days earlier.
