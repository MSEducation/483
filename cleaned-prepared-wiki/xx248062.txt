History

In the thirteenth century the Order of St. Anthony was established here. This square partly absorbed the Rue Pierre-Percée, now called rue Monseigneur Lavarenne.
The square was modified when the Quai Fulchiron was created in 1858, then expanded after the destruction of houses that prolonged the rue Lavarenne.
This square is situated on one of the many ports of the Saône, the port du Sablet or Sablé,

Architecture and description

The square has limestone benches and beautiful pavements. The vegetation consists mainly of silk trees and groves of laurel
The majority of the square consists of two rows of four to six-storey buildings with narrow facades generally built in the 19th century. The building between the wharf and the rue Lavarenne was created in 1845 ; it has  six different floors with a Virgin and Child at the corner of the wharf. At No. 8, two plaques say the height of the floods of the Saône on 5 November 1840 and 21 May 1856.
After having served for a while as a station for trolleys and buses, the square was gradually transformed into a large garden through a space reorganization. In 2008, landscapers of the Ilex agency completely modified the square.
The Église Saint-Georges is near the square.
