History

Formation and early years (1997–1999)

The members of Trapt met in high school in the mid-'90s and shortly thereafter developed an act with Chris Taylor Brown (vocals), Simon Ormandy (guitar), Peter Charell (bass), and David Stege (drums). The band's first few rehearsals were in Ormandy's guesthouse, which had a party-like atmosphere with its loft overlooking the living room.

"Amalgamation" (1999-2000)

The debut independent release by Trapt, released in June 1999 and sold only in the Los Gatos, California area. The album was a local success, selling over 900 copies by the end of 1999. This album sports a drastically different sound compared to later releases, with vocalist Chris Taylor Brown rapping in every song, with later releases not containing rapping at all.

"The Glimpse" (2000)

Trapt's final independent release, last EP.

Trapt (2001–2003)

The band proceeded to sign with Warner Bros. Records and started recording their debut album, with Robin Diaz replacing Stege on the drums. On November 5, 2002 the band released their self-titled album, Trapt, which produced a total of three singles. In 2002 "Headstrong" was the first, and it reached No. 1 on both the Modern Rock Tracks and Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, as well as No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking their most successful single to date. The second single from the album, "Still Frame", also managed to achieve No. 1 spot on the US Mainstream Rock chart, and No. 3 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The third single, "Echo" peaked at No. 10 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The Trapt album was certified platinum by the RIAA. Although not a single, the last song on the album, "New Beginning", was featured in the film "Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler".

Someone in Control (2004–2006)

Before releasing their next full-length album, the band released a self-titled three-track EP, released March 30, 2004, that included live versions of the "Made of Glass" and "Echo" tracks from their debut album, as well as a previously unreleased non-LP track, "Promise".
Their second full length album, titled Someone in Control, was released September 13, 2005. It produced three singles for the band: "Stand Up", "Waiting", and "Disconnected (Out of Touch)". While these singles didn't do as well as those released from the first album, "Stand Up" still reached No. 3 on the US Mainstream Rock chart.
In support of this album, Trapt toured with Thousand Foot Krutch, Silvertide, Chevelle, Three Days Grace, Nickelback, and others.

Only Through the Pain (2007–2009)

Their live album titled Trapt Live!, was released September 18, 2007. The album featured two new studio songs ("Stay Alive" and "Everything to Lose") as well as live versions of nine songs from their earlier records. On March 7, 2008, it was announced that lead guitarist Simon Ormandy had parted ways with the band. He was replaced by Robb Torres.
On June 10, 2008, Trapt released "Who's Going Home with You Tonight?" as a single. They also recorded a music video for the song. On July 1, 2008 "Who's Going Home with You Tonight?" was released as part of the weekly downloadable content for the Rock Band game series. Only Through the Pain was released on August 5, 2008. Trapt toured in support of the album by opening for Hinder on the Jägermeister Music Tour with Rev Theory. In March 2009, Trapt started the Contagious Tour, also featuring Red, Halestorm, Inept and Since October at several shows. "Contagious" was the album's second and last single, and was also available as a free playable track in the iPhone and iPod Touch game Tap Tap Revenge 2.

No Apologies (2010–2011)

In March 2010 Trapt said they were wrapping up the recording process of their new record with producer Johnny K. No Apologies was released on October 12, 2010. The first single, "Sound Off", was available on iTunes July 20, 2010. Another song, "Stranger In the Mirror", was released for free from the band's Facebook page August 11, 2010.
In September 2010, the songs "Drama Queen," "No Apologies," and "Storyteller" were made available on the band's website, along with the cover art for "No Apologies". A digital-only download bonus track, "Head Up High," was released exclusively to those who pre-ordered the record from the official website.
On October 25, 2011, Cleopatra Records and Trapt released a compilation album called Headstrong. It featured re-recorded versions of songs, demo tracks, remixes, and acoustic versions of "Headstrong" and "Echo."

Trapt released a new single "Bring It", which now has a new re-mastered version featuring Dylan Howard on drums, which is being released to radio as the official 1st single. A video for "Bring It"  is available on YouTube. The new record, Reborn, was released January 22nd 2013. The band also announced this would be their first independent release, opting out from major record labels as they decided to do everything on their own.
