Richard Burton Matheson (February 20, 1926 – June 23, 2013) was an American author and screenwriter, primarily in the fantasy, horror, and science fiction genres. He may be known best as the author of I Am Legend, a 1954 horror novel that has been adapted for the screen four times, although five more of his novels or short stories have been adapted as major motion pictures: The Shrinking Man, Hell House, What Dreams May Come, Bid Time Return (filmed as Somewhere in Time), A Stir of Echoes and Button, Button. Matheson also wrote numerous television episodes of The Twilight Zone for Rod Serling, including "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet" and "Steel". He later adapted his 1971 short story "Duel" as a screenplay which was promptly directed by a young Steven Spielberg, for the television movie of the same name.

Retrieved March 31, 2008. "The author Stephen King has said that Richard Matheson is the one author 'who influenced me the most as a writer'. Such an accolade is humbly received by Mr. Matheson, a native of Allendale, but he adds that influencing people is what good writing is all about." the son of Norwegian immigrants Fanny (née Mathieson) and Bertolf Matheson, a tile floor installer. Matheson was raised in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1943. He then entered the military and spent World War II as an infantry soldier. In 1949, he earned his bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri and in in 1951, he moved to California. He married Ruth Ann Woodson on July 1, 1952 and had four children, three of whom (Chris, Richard Christian, and Ali Matheson) became writers of fiction and screenplays.

Career

Matheson's first short story was published when he was only eight years old, appearing in his local newspaper The Brooklyn Eagle. After graduating from high school in 1943 he did a spell of service in the US Army, an experience which featured in his 1960 novel The Beardless Warriors. After the war he studied journalism at the University of Missouri, graduating in 1949.
His first novel, Hunger and Thirst, was ignored by publishers for several decades but his short story "Born of Man and Woman" was published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Summer 1950, the new quarterly's third issue and attracted attention. It is the tale of a monstrous child chained by its parents in the cellar, cast as the creature's diary in poignantly non-idiomatic English. Later that year he placed stories in the first and third numbers of Galaxy Science Fiction, a new monthly. His first anthology of work was published in 1954. Between 1950 and 1971, he produced dozens of stories, frequently blending elements of the science fiction, horror, and fantasy genres. He was a member of the Southern California School of Writers in the 1950s and 1960s, which included Charles Beaumont, Ray Bradbury, George Clayton Johnson, William F. Nolan, Jerry Sohl, and others.rodserling. Retrieved October 31, 2012. Matheson appears in two documentaries related to this era: Jason V Brock's Charles Beaumont: The Life of Twilight Zone's Magic Man,French, Lawrence "Richard Matheson remembers his good friend Charles Beaumont",  Retrieved October 31, 2012. and The AckerMonster Chronicles!, which details the life of agent and editor Forrest J Ackerman.
Several of his stories, like "Third from the Sun" (1950), "Deadline" (1959), and "Button, Button" (1970) are simple sketches with twist endings; others, like "Trespass" (1953), "Being" (1954), and "Mute" (1962) explore their characters' dilemmas over 20 or 30 pages. Some tales, such as "The Doll that Does Everything" (1954) and "The Funeral" (1955) incorporate zany satirical humour at the expense of genre clichés, and are written in an hysterically overblown prose very different from Matheson's usual pared-down style. Others, like "The Test" (1954) and "Steel" (1956), portray the moral and physical struggles of ordinary people, rather than the then nearly ubiquitous scientists and superheroes, in situations which are at once futuristic and everyday. Still others, such as "Mad House" (1953), "The Curious Child" (1954), and perhaps most of all, "Duel" (1971), are tales of paranoia, in which the everyday environment of the present day becomes inexplicably alien or threatening. "Duel" was adapted into the 1971 TV movie of the same name.
Matheson wrote screenplays for several television programs including the Westerns Cheyenne, Have Gun – Will Travel, and Lawman. He is, however, most closely associated with the American TV series The Twilight Zone, for which he wrote more than a dozen episodes; including "Steel" (mentioned above), and the famous "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet" (1963), plus "Little Girl Lost" (1962), a story about a young girl tumbling into the fourth dimension. For all of Matheson's Twilight Zone scripts, he also wrote the introductory and closing statements spoken by creator Rod Serling.[ref]
