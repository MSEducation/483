The BG&CM Railroad or Bountiful Grain and Craig Mountain Railroad  is a Class III shortline railroad located in north central Idaho.

Summary

The BG&CM operated a line between Spalding and Cottonwood, along the former Second Subdivision of the Camas Prairie Railroad. Spalding is located about  east of Lewiston, which is at Idaho's western border with Washington. BGCM connects with Great Northwest Railroad at Spalding. BGCM also operates the portion of the former Camas Prairie Railroad which runs from Spalding to Orofino, then to Kooskia along the river grade of the Clearwater River.
BGCM's route consists of the former Camas Prairie Railroad's Second Subdivision line, which was  south, across Lawyer's Canyon to Cottonwood, stopping the salvage crews from going further north. 
In 2005, Watco Companies, owner of the BGCM's Spalding connection Great Northwest Railroad (GRNW), leased to BGCM the entire  GRNW route east of Lewiston of mainline track, including the railroad from Orofino to Konkolville. 
The BGCM route had been acquired from Camas Prairie RailNet (CSPR) in December 2002, a subsidiary of North American RailNet, which had acquired the entire Camas Prairie line in April 1998 from the line's previous (and original) co-owners, Union Pacific Railroad and Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway. CSPR received permission from the Surface Transportation Board to abandon the Grangeville Branch in September 2000 and made its last run on that line in late November.
As of April, 2013, the second sub is used for storage of empty flatcars between Lapwai and Culdesac. The grade crossing of US 95 south of Craigmont has been removed and the crossings in that town are graveled over. Also, one of the wooden trestles—Bridge 21.3 Winchester was lost in a forest fire on September 7, 2011.kboi2.html All that remains of the trestle is a single rail suspended precariously across the chasm, as well as ashes and bits of metal beneath.facebook.php?fbid=10151609980454055&l=8b6d283b66 A fire also destroyed the original elevators at Craigmont, beginning on May 12, 2013.

History

The Camas Prairie Railroad was formed in 1909, and was jointly owned and operated by the former Northern Pacific Railway (later Burlington Northern Santa Fe), and the former Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company (later Union Pacific). The two railroads were competitors throughout the Pacific Northwest, battling to capture railroad traffic in timber, minerals, and agricultural products. from Orofino northeast to near Jaype. The Orofino to Jaype segment was out of service.
BGCM is owned by Railroad Materials Salvage of Richmond, Missouri.
In 2009, BGCM's owner attempts to purchase a portion of the Arizona and California Railroad, running  between Rice, California and Ripley, California through Blythe, California from RailAmerica then-recently granted for abandonment, but failed to get an offer of financial assistance.stb.gov/?sGet&Dl5ZTH1WXw1zAAsBXBdTV0x6Sw1xfAMCXAEHCW4DFncBenELWAEFAW0DGgYBdBVRAlxHcUsOS1FELBVCO1RFS0ZcQQ0AfQcHS1deVEpdTl1VcAEAWAICDgoBamB0C20xNzgvMy8wME0zMgw%3D
