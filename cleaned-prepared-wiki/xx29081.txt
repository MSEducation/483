Grudziądz ; the form Grudentia is used by e.g. A. Lentz, Philologus 23 (1866), p. 175. is a city of 96 042 inhabitants (2010) on the Vistula River in northern Poland. Situated in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship (since 1999), the city was previously in the Toruń Voivodeship (1975–1998).

Geographical location

Grudziądz is located close to the east shore of river Vistula, approximately  south-west of Kaliningrad.

History

As part of Piast Poland

Initially Grudziądz was a defensive gród founded by Polish ruler Bolesław Chrobry.Wielka encyklopedia polski: Tom 1 Wojciech Słowakiewicz, Jacek Słowiński, Piotr Turkot page 270 Fogra, 2000

State of the Teutonic Knights

The settlement was re-fortified again since 1234 by the Teutonic Order; the erection of the castle  with the help of  stone as building material was begun with around the middle of the 13th century. Under the protection of the castle the settlement gradually begun to  develop to  a town.  In 1277 both "the castle and the town" were besieged heavily by the Yotvingians.
The oldest building parts of the Catholic St. Nicholas' Church stem from the end of the 13th century. The Holy Spirit Church, which apparently was founded already during the 13th century, is mentioned together with the town's hospital for the first time in  1345.
During the era of the State of the Teutonic Knights Graudenz had become a distinguished trade center, in particular for textiles and agricultural products including grain.

Under the crown of the Kingdom of Poland

In 1440, Graudenz joined the Prussian Confederation opposing the government of the State of the Teutonic Knights. At the beginning of the Thirteen Years' War of the Cities (1454–66) the citizens forced the Teutonic Order to hand over the castle. Although in the town there existed also a strong party supporting the Knights, during the entire war both the town and the castle remained in possession of the confederation party. The confederation party  formally asked the King of Poland, Casimir IV Jagiellon, to join Poland. Thus, among other towns, in the mid-15th century Grudziądz also came under the protectorate of Poland.  Between 1466 and 1772 the city belonged to the province of  Royal Prussia under the crown of the Kingdom of Poland.
After the great depression of the War of the Cities, new economical growth in the town was slow before the middle of the 16th century;  the progress was hampered by the religious struggle, and by the Polish–Swedish wars throughout the 17th century.
Following Protestant Reformation, in 1569 the local Protestants were given access to the Holy Spirit Church; in 1572 Catholicism seemed to have vanished almost entirely in the town.
Since 1622 Jesuits from Thorn (Toruń) had a station in  Graudenz, which in 1640 was already so strong that it was able  to form a residence in Graudenz, despite of objections from the side of  the magistrate of the town.
The town proper was surrounded by town walls, except on the side of river Vistula, where instead of walls there stood huge massive grain silos, from where grain could be transported through wooden pipes to the embankment of the river.

Prussia and Germany

Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the city was annexed by the German Kingdom of Prussia. In 1773 the town had a population of only 2,172 persons.
In 1871 Graudenz became part of the unified German Empire. With the improvement of the railway network in Germany, Graudenz transiently lost its meaning as an important trading place for grain. In  1878 the railway line Goßlershausen—Graudenz was opened. After the construction of a railroad bridge across the Vistula in 1878,  in 1789 the railway line Graudenz—Laskowitz was opened in addition,  and 
Graudenz became a rapidly growing industrialized city. In 1883 also the railway line Thorn—Graudenz—Marienburg was taken into operation.
In 1899 a Chamber of Commerce was opened in Graudenz, and in 1900 the town became a district center. Around the turn to the 20th century, Graudenz had become an important cultural centre in east Germany with numerous schools,  municipal archives and a museum.
The city was the site of a military prison for Polish activists - those released, who left Europe, formed the Gromada Grudziądz in Portsmouth, England, in 1835, as part of the Great Emigration movement.Historia Polski, 1795-1918 Stefan Kieniewicz Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1975 page 142
Until 1920 Graudenz belonged to the administrative district of Regierungsbezirk Marienwerder in the Province of West Prussia.

=Prussian rule and Germanization in Landkreis Graudenz=

In the 18th and 19th centuries the city was part of the area affected by the Prussian Partition of Poland, where Germanisation was enforced, beginning in 1772. Frederick had nourished a particular   contempt for the Polish nation and state. Frederick settled around 300,000 colonists in the eastern provinces of Prussia. Using state funds for colonization, German craftsmen were placed in all local Polish cities. Ossolińskich, 1985 "Z funduszy na kolonizację osiedlano w miastach fachowców z krajów niemieckich" A second colonization wave of ethnic Germans was pursued by Prussia after 1832. 4 Polska w czasach walk o niepodległość (1815 - 1864). Od niewoli do niepodległości (1864 - 1918) Marian Zagórniak, Józef Buszko 2003 page 186 Laws were passed aimed at Germanisation of the Polish inhabited areas and 154,000 colonists were settled by the Prussian Settlement Commission before World War I.
Professor Martin Kitchen writes that in areas where the Polish population lived alongside Germans a virtual apartheid existed, with bans on the Polish language and religious discrimination, besides attempts to colonize the areas with Germans.A history of modern Germany, 1800-2000 Martin Kitchen Wiley-Blackwel 2006, page 130)
In 1890 only about 200 Poles lived in the town of  Graudenz, but approximately 16,850 Poles in the rural district  of Landkreis Graudenz (as compared to about 26,000 Germans in Landkreis Graudenz).
To resist Germanisation,Kraj a emigracja. Ruch ludowy wobec wychodźstwa chłopskiego do krajów Ameryki Łacińskiej (do 1939 roku) Muzeum Historii Polskiego Ruchu Ludowego 2006, page 290 Polish activists started to publish the newspaper "Gazeta Grudziądzka" in 1894. It advocated the social and economical emancipation of rural society and opposed Germanization – publishing articles critical of Germany. The German attempts to repress its editor Wiktor Kulerski only helped to increase its circulation. From 1898 to 1901, a secret society of Polish students seeking to restore Polish independence operated in the city, but the activists were tried by German courts in 1901, frustrating their efforts.Filomaci Pomorscy: tajne związki młodzieży polskiej na Pomorzu Gdańskim w latach 1830-1920, Jerzy Szews, Polska Akademia Nauk, Instytut Historii Nauki, Oświaty i techniki, Zakład Dziejów Oświaty, 1992 - page 129
In Graudenz, German soldiers were stationed in the local fortress as part of the Germanization measures, and the authorities placed soldiers with the most chauvinistic attitude towards the Poles there. Oddział w Poznaniu, page 119, Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe The German government brought in more stationed military, merchants and state officials to influence population figures,Historia Polski 1795-1918. Andrzej Chwalba. Page 444 Wydawnictwo Literackie 2007 and in the 1910 census 84% of the population of the town and 58% of the county was recorded as German.
Census figures published by the German Empire have been criticised as unreliable. Historians believe they have a high degree of falsification; formal pressure on census takers (predominantly school-teachers) was possible, and a new bilingual category was created to further complicate the results, as bilingual people(that is those who could speak both German and Polish) wre classified as Germans. Bjork, 2008, page 152-153; University of Michigan Press Some analysts have asserted that all people registering as bilingual were classified as Germans. Hunt Tooley, page 13; University of Nebraska Press. The Polish population in this heavily Germanised city has been officially estimated at around 12-15% during this period. 
The Polish population numbers rose steadily before the First World War., 1978 page 214Życie kulturalno-literackie Grudziądza w latach 1918-1939 Eugenia Sławińska Gdańskie Towarzystwo Naukowe, 1980 - 211, page 11 In the German election of 1912, the National Liberal Party of Germany received 53% of all votes, whilst Polish candidates won 23% of votes. In 1912, Wiktor Kulerski founded the Polish Catholic Peasant Party in the city, which aimed at protecting the local Polish populationDzieje Wielkopolski: Lata 1793-1918, Jerzy Topolski, Wydawn. Poznańskie 1973, page 503,
In 1913, the Polish Gazeta Grudziądzka reached a circulation of 128,000, making it the third largest Polish newspaper in the world. Ruch ludowy wobec wychodźstwa chłopskiego do krajów Ameryki Łacińskiej (do 1939 roku) Muzeum Historii Polskiego Ruchu Ludowego 2006, page 285

Interwar years

When on  January 23, 1920, the regulations of the Treaty of Versailles became effective, and the Polish Corridor  was arranged in a newly reborn Polish state (Second Polish Republic), Graudenz was incorporated  under its Polish name Grudziądz into  the  new Second Polish Republic. At that time Józef Włodek, the newly appointed Polish mayor, described his impression of the town as "modern but unfortunately completely German" Quotation:"Es habe auf ihn,..., den Eindruck einer modernen und "leider völlig deutschen" Stadt gemacht,"
Between 1926 and 1934 the number of Germans (34,194 in 1910) rose from 3,542 to 3,875. Some Polish authors emphasize a wider emigration pattern motivated chiefly by economic conditions and the unwillingess of the German minority to live in the Polish state. 2007, 3, s. 145-158
The German author Christian Raitz von Frentz writes that after the First World War ended, the Polish government tried to reverse the systematic Germanization of the past decadesA Lesson Forgotten: Minority Protection Under the League of Nations: The Case of the German Minority in Poland, 1920-193 page 8 LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 1999
Prejudices, stereotypes and conflicts dating back to German harsh rule and discrimination of Poles influenced Polish policies towards minorities in the new independent Polish state. Kotowski p. 43
The Polish authorities, supported by the public (e.g. the "explicitly anti-German" Związek Obrony Kresów Zachodnich), initiated a number of measures to further Polonization. S. 94. The local press was also hostile towards the Germans.
Fearful of a re-Germanization of the city, the Polish paper '"Słowo Pomorskie" (23.19.1923) criticized the authorities of Grudziądz for tolerating the local German amateur theatre "Deutsche Bühne". The theatre was funded by money from BerlinMniejszość niemiecka na Pomorzu w okresie międzywojennymPrzemysław Hauser UAM, 1998, page 219 Created before the war, its actors were mostly German officers stationed with the local garrison Historia Pomorza: 1850-1918, pt. 2. Polityka i kultura Gerard Labuda, Stanisław Salmonowicz - 2002, page 398 -
The mayor responded by pointing out that the theatre was being monitored because of suspected "anti-state activities".  According to Kotowski, this episode indicates that even the most minor activities of the German minority were closely scrutinized by the Polish authorities beginning with the earliest phase of Polish policy towards the German minority. S. 94-95. 
The German theatre was re-opened by the Nazis in 1943,[ref]Pamiętnik teatralny:

In the 20 years between the world wars, Grudziądz served as an important centre of culture and education with one of the biggest Polish military garrisons and several military schools located both in and around the city. A large economic potential and the existence of important institutions like the Pomeranian Tax Office and the Pomeranian Chamber of Industry and Trade, helped Grudziądz become the economic capital of the Pomeranian Voivodeship in the interwar period. Grudziądz's economic potential was featured at the First Pomeranian Exhibition of Agriculture and Industry in 1925, officially opened by Stanisław Wojciechowski, President of the Second Polish Republic.
The 64th and 65th Infantry Regiments and the 16th Light Artillery Regiment of the Polish Army were stationed in Grudziądz during the 19 years of the inter-war period. They were part of the 16th Infantry Division, which had its headquarters in the city, as did the cavalry's famous 18th Pomeranian Uhlans Regiment. The Grudziądz Centre of Cavalry Training educated many notable army commanders. Military education in Grudziądz was also provided by the Centre of the Gendarmerie, the Air School of Shooting and Bombarding, and the N.C.O. Professional School, which offered courses for infantry reserve officer cadets.
In 1920 a German-language school was founded. In 1931 the Polish government decreed a reduction in the number of German classes in the school and requested lists of Catholic children and those pupils with Polish-sounding names which they viewed as victims of Germanization, from the German school. Although the list was not prepared, some of the children were transferred, which led to a school-strike. The German school followed ideas and customs as those in Nazi Reich.Mniejszość niemiecka na Pomorzu w okresie międzywojennym Przemysław Hauser UAM, 1998, page 293 It was headed by a Nazi sympathiser Hilgendorf who praised Nazi ideologyMniejszości narodowe i wyznaniowe na Pomorzu w XIX i XX wieku:zbiór studiów Mieczysław Wojciechowski Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika, 1998 - 292, page 82,90
The Polish authorities were alarmed when a notebook of one female student was discovered by them, which contained the Nazi party anthem, the Horst Wessel Lied and revisionistic text. The discovery caused outrage and calls to dismiss Hilgendorf due to his irredentist beliefsVolk, Staat, Gott!«Die deutsche Minderheit in Polen und ihr Schulwesen 1918-1939 , page 585 In November 1933 two German craftsmen were killed by a Polish mob during a local election campaign.

World War II

On September 3, 1939 military troops of  Germany's Third Reich  entered the town  after the Battle of Grudziądz  and occupied it. From 26 October 1939 to 1945 Graudenz was part of the administrative district of Regierungsbezirk Marienwerder   in the new province of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia.

=German atrocities=

Graudenz was the location of the German concentration camp Graudenz, a subcamp of Stutthof concentration camp.
In early September, 25 Polish citizens were detained as hostages - priests, teachers and other members that enjoyed the respect of local society. They were threatened with execution if any harm came to the Ethnic Germans from the city who were detained and held by the Polish authorities during the invasion of Poland. After their initial release on the return of the members of the German minority, they were re-arrested and most of them were shot. Poznań: Instytut Zachodni, 1972, ss. 78-79.
On 9 September a further 85 people were imprisoned by the Germans Maria Wardzyńska: Był rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpieczeństwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion. Warszawa: Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, 2009, ss. 109–110.
The German authorities destroyed the city's monuments to Polish independenceZbigniew Otremba: Grudziądz. Kronika miasta. Gdańsk: wydawnictwo Regnum, 2007, page 81–82. ISBN 978-83-920686-1-7 and banned Polish priests from speaking Polish during church massesJan Sziling. Niektóre problemy okupacji hitlerowskiej w Grudziądzu (1939-1945). „Rocznik Grudziądzki". V-VI, ss. 448–449, 1962.
On 4 September the Einsatzgruppe V demanded a list of names of all members of the 600-strong Jewish community within 14 hours, as well as a  list of all their possessions. They were also fined 20.000 zlotych Jochen Böhler, Klaus-Michael Mallmann, Jürgen Matthäus: Einsatzgruppen w Polsce. Warszawa: Bellona, 2009,page. 89
On 6 September the whole city was covered with posters demanding that Jews and "mixed races" of category I and IInd degree (so-called Mischlinge, i.e. persons of mixed race) gather at the headquarters of the Einsatzgruppe V (established in the local school). Around 100 people responded to the demand and were immediately arrested and robbed. After this they were transported to an unknown destination and disappeared - it is believed that they were most likely executed by the Germans in the Mniszek-Grupa forests. Niektóre problemy okupacji hitlerowskiej w Grudziądzu. S. 450. s. 124.
On 19 October Graudenz was visited by the NSDAP Gauleiter (regional chief) Albert Forster. In a public speech to the Volksdeutsche, he declared that the area was to become "one hundred percent" German, and that Poles "have nothing to do here, and should be evicted"Zbigniew Otremba: Grudziądz. Kronika miasta. Gdańsk: wydawnictwo Regnum, 2007, ss. 81–82. ISBN 978-83-920686-1-7.

==Selbstschutz participation in mass murder==

Alongside the military and Einsatzgruppen administration, the first structures of Selbstschutz were established - a paramilitary formation of members of the German minority in the region. The head of Selbstschutz in Graudenz was Doctor Joachim Gramse. Niektóre problemy okupacji hitlerowskiej w Grudziądzu... „op.". page 451Henryk Bierut: Martyrologia grudziądzan podczas okupacji hitlerowskiej. Grudziądz: Wydawnictwo Komitetu Ochrony Pamięci Walk i Męczeństwa w Grudziądzu, 1999, page 9
In October 1939, Selbstschutz created an interment camp for Poles seeking to restore Polish independence, whose commandant was a local German Kurt Gotze. Grudziądz: Wydawnictwo Komitetu Ochrony Pamięci Walk i Męczeństwa w Grudziądzu, 1999, s. 9.
Teachers, officials, social workers, doctors, merchants, members of patriotic organisations, lawyers, policemen, farmers and 150 Polish priests were held in this camp. It is estimated that around 4,000 to 5,000 people went through it... page 171. Other arrested Poles were held in the cellars of Graudenz Fortress. Niektóre problemy okupacji hitlerowskiej w Grudziądzu... The local Germans who ran the camp established their own "court" which decided the fate of the prisoners. The "court" comprised: Kurt Gotze, Helmut Domke, Horst Kriedte, Hans Abromeit (owner of a drugstore), Paul Neuman (barber). pages 10-11 Based on their decisions, some of the prisoners were sent to concentration camps, 300 were murdered en masse; only a few were released. Warszawa: Interpress, 1988, page 16. Those sentenced to death were mostly executed through shooting by the Selbstschutz in Księże Góry near Graudenz; in October and November 1939 several hundred people were murdered there and their bodies buried in five mass graves...., page 54
Further executions were carried out in desolate areas of Graudenz: on 11 November 1939 near Graudenz Fortress, the Selbstschutz executed ten Polish teachers, four Polish priests and four women. Kronika miasta. Gdańsk: wydawnictwo Regnum, 2007, pages 81–82. Additionally, 37 people were murdered in Graudenz city park.... page 172. On 29 October 1939 a unit of Selbstschutz mass-murdered ten Polish hostages as revenge for posters that had appeared in the city calling for resistance against Nazi rule.

=At the end of World War II=

As the result of heavy fighting in 1945, over 60% of the city was destroyed. Soviet Major Lev Kopelev covered those battles and the final surrender of the German garrison in his book "To Be Preserved Forever". He describes the joint psychological warfare of March 1945 in the city by the Red Army and members of the NKFD. As the war ended, the German-speaking population of the city fled or was expelled to Germany. The city became home to Poles which had emigrated from  Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union east of the Curzon line, where they had been asked by Sowjet authorities either to accept a new national membership or to leave their former homeland..
