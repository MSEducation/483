Maxis is an American company founded as an independent video game developer in 1987.  It is a subsidiary of Electronic Arts (EA), and serves as one of the four major labels of the company. Maxis is the creator of one of the best-selling computer games of all time, The Sims, and its sequel, The Sims 2. These titles and their related products are the brand's most popular and successful lines.
Most Maxis titles are simulation-based. Maxis founder Will Wright likens them to "digital dollhouses." Maxis has also released games developed by other production houses, such as A-Train and SimTower.

History

Origin and early acclaim

Maxis was founded in 1987 by Will Wright and Jeff Braun to help publish SimCity on home computers. Before then, the game was only available on a limited basis on the Commodore 64 due to few publishers showing any interest in porting it. The reason for this is because SimCity wasn't a traditional game that had definite "win" and "lose" conditions. The title went on to become, statistically, one of the most popular and successful video games of all time. The SimCity series has spawned multiple sequels and spin-offs.  Following the broad success of SimCity 2000, Maxis moved from Orinda, California, to Walnut Creek in 1994.
After such success with the SimCity series, Maxis tried various other Sim- titles. Some of these attempts include SimAnt, SimFarm, SimEarth, SimLife, SimTower, SimIsle and SimHealth. Maxis was also approached by companies to design business aids; SimRefinery is one example. The success of these franchises varies, but none matched that of the original SimCity. Maxis' hit The Sims is the only notable exception.
Maxis also released some non-simulation titles, such as 1991's RoboSport and the well-known 1995 3D Pinball for Windows, which has been included as one of the standard system games in many Windows releases.

=Origin of the name=

Maxis's name was derived from a formula suggested by Jeff Braun's father: computer game companies should have two-syllable names and should include an 'x'. This is confirmed in an interview with a Maxis employee on a bonus disc released with The Sims: Makin' Magic advertising The Sims 2 and also in early packaging of SimCity 2000 Special Edition.
The interview also addresses a rumor stating that Maxis is named after "six AM" in reverse, typically the time of day that a Sim's alarm clock wakes him/her up. The Maxis employee explains that it is just an interesting coincidence. An easter egg programmed in SimCity 3000 displays the message "Do you know that Maxis spelled backwards is Six AM?" on the game's ticker bar upon entering the cheat code "maxis" in the cheat entry box.  Another homage is featured in SimCity 2013: the moving truck company is named SixAM, with a similar logo.

Decline

After the immense success of SimCity, Maxis experimented with different genres. However, their new games, including The Crystal Skull and SimCopter, were commercial failures. They also acquired Cinematronics to create a game called Crucible and Full Tilt! Pinball. Heavy losses and lack of direction led Maxis to begin considering acquisition offers.

Acquisition by EA

EA completed its acquisition of Maxis on July 28, 1997. Compared to other companies acquired by EA, such as Origin Systems and Westwood Studios, the absorption of Maxis took a slower pace, and the company staff was lost only gradually.
Over 1998 Maxis was allowed to finish SimCity 3000 on its own time; following this, Wright's efforts were thrown into The Sims, at the time seen as a major gamble for the company, as the dollhouse game was not seen as a match for the video game market's demographics.  After development work for the game was concluded, Maxis' longtime studios in Walnut Creek were officially closed in 2004, For the first half of the decade, Maxis continued to produce expansions and sequels to The Sims.
SimCity 4 was released in 2003, it was a series first implementing true 3D, as well as the first where Wright was not directly involved with work.

Spore, hiatus, and revival

As The Sims became a steady success, Will Wright began to focus on Spore.  With the spin-off of The Sims Studio, it was Maxis' only project (In 2006, Maxis.com simply redirected to The Sims
Will Wright left Maxis in 2009.  Maxis' only new standalone title until 2013 was Darkspore.  During this time, Maxis.  Throughout this period, the studio continued to operate in Emeryville.
At the 2012 Game Developers Conference, EA announced a new SimCity along with a new logo for the Maxis brand.  Maxis became one of four primary labels at EA, replacing the "EA Play" brand. and SimCity (2013).
EA Maxis now includes: Maxis (Emeryville), The Sims Studio (Redwood Shores), EA Salt Lake (Salt Lake City) and Maxis Helsinki (Helsinki, Finland), a studio focused on The Sims for mobile platforms.

Notable creations

Maxis is widely regarded for its innovative simulation games, in which there is no specific goal to the player, making its games almost endless.

SimCity series

SimCity was Maxis' first release and innovated the conception of gaming as there was no specific goal to be reached, meaning that it could neither be won nor lost. In this franchise, the player is a mayor that may, at their leisure, take a city from a single village to a successful metropolis, laying down zones, taking care of the public services and stimulating the city's economy. The series includes six main games (SimCity, SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, SimCity 4, SimCity Societies and SimCity) and three spin-offs (Sim City: The Card Game, SimCopter and Streets of SimCity). SimCity Societies, the fifth main release for the franchise, was not produced by Maxis, but by Tilted Mill Entertainment, being described as a 'social engineering simulator' and criticized for the lack of SimCity's traditional gaming formula. In 2013, EA Maxis label (Emeryville) released SimCity (2013).

The Sims

Maxis' most successful series to date and the best-selling PC game of all time is The Sims (2000). Maxis has developed seven expansion packs for the game as well as an online version (The Sims Online). Maxis released The Sims 2 in 2004, a sequel title that features a full 3D environment as opposed to the original's dimetric engine. Eight expansion packs and nine stuff packs have been released for the sequel. The third rendition, The Sims 3, was released by EA in 2009. Production of the game, its expansion packs and stuff packs were left to The Sims Studio as Maxis (Emeryville) focused on their Spore franchise. Eleven expansion packs and eight stuff packs have been released for this third generation of the series so far. Since the 6th expansion of The Sims 3, which was released in early 2012, the expansion packs are produced under the name of EA Maxis label (Redwood Shores) according to the press releases.  On May 6, 2013, it was announced that Maxis would be developing The Sims 4.edge-online.com/news/maxis-announces-the-sims-4/

Spore

Spore was released on September 7, 2008 (September 5 in Europe). Players create species starting at the single cell level, and develop them into sentient life. The goal is for them to eventually gain the intelligence to create spaceships. The Spore Creature Creator allows users to create species for later use in the game. This is one of few Maxis' games to feature goals on its plot as the player must complete five different phases and reach the space-traveling technology. There is also an ultimate goal, which is entering the galactic core, a massive black hole surrounded by a powerful and hostile cyborg species called The Grox. However, the player can stay in a single phase as long as they wish, even after completing it.
The game holds an 84 Metascore on Metacritic, indicating generally positive reviews from professional critics which is tempered by the overwhelming number of negative user reviews, mostly relating to the game's unusually large amount of technical issues. EA Games confirmed the production of expansion packs due to Spore's financial success, later releasing Spore: Galactic Adventures in 2009 as well as several spin-offs and "parts packs", plus the addition of the spin-off of Spore, Darkspore.
