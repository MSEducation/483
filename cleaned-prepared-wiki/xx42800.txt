The blue light from the jet emerging from the bright AGN core, towards the lower right, is due to synchrotron radiation.]]
Synchrotron radiation is also generated by astronomical objects, typically where relativistic electrons spiral (and hence change velocity) through magnetic fields.
Two of its characteristics include non-thermal power-law spectra, and polarization. Bordovitsyn, "Synchrotron Radiation in Astrophysics" (1999) Synchrotron Radiation Theory and Its Development, ISBN 981-02-3156-3

History of detection

It was first detected in a jet emitted by Messier 87 in 1956 by Geoffrey R. Burbidge,Burbidge, G. R. "On Synchrotron Radiation from Messier 87. Astrophysical Journal, vol. 124, p. 416" who saw it as confirmation of a prediction by Iosif S. Shklovsky in 1953, but it had been predicted earlier by Hannes Alfvén and Nicolai Herlofson Alfvén, H.; Herlofson, N. "Cosmic Radiation and Radio Stars" Physical Review (1950), vol. 78, Issue 5, pp. 616–616 in 1950.
T. K. Breus noted that questions of priority on the history of astrophysical synchrotron radiation is complicated, writing:
Supermassive black holes have been suggested for producing synchrotron radiation, by ejection of jets produced by gravitationally accelerating ions through the super contorted 'tubular' polar areas of magnetic fields. Such jets, the nearest being in Messier 87, have been confirmed by the Hubble telescope as apparently superluminal, travelling at 6×c (six times the speed of light) from our planetary frame. This phenomenon is caused because the jets are travelling very near the speed of light and at a very small angle towards the observer. Because at every point of their path the high-velocity jets are emitting light, the light they emit does not approach the observer much more quickly than the jet itself. Light emitted over hundreds of years of travel thus arrives at the observer over a much smaller time period (ten or twenty years) giving the illusion of faster than light travel. There is no violation of special relativity.

Pulsar wind nebulae

A class of astronomical sources where synchrotron emission is important is the pulsar wind nebulae, a.k.a. plerions, of which the Crab nebula and its associated pulsar are archetypal.
Pulsed emission gamma-ray radiation from the Crab has recently been observed up to ≥25 GeV,[ref]"Observation of Pulsed {gamma}-Rays Above 25 GeV from the Crab Pulsar with MAGIC", Science 21 November 2008:
Vol. 322. no. 5905, pp. 1221–1224"[/ref] probably due to synchrotron emission by electrons trapped in the strong magnetic field around the pulsar.
Polarization in the Crab[ref]
Dean et al.,"Polarized Gamma-Ray Emission from the Crab", Science 29 August 2008: Vol. 321. no. 5893, pp. 1183–1185[/ref] at energies from 0.1 to 1.0 MeV illustrates a typical synchrotron radiation.

Formulation

Liénard–Wiechert Field

We start with the expressions for the Liénard–Wiechert field :
where
In equation (1), and (2), the first terms fall off as the inverse square of the distance from the particle, and this first term is called the generalized Coulomb field or velocity field. And the second terms fall off as the inverse first power of the distance from the source, and it is called the radiation field or acceleration field.
If we ignore the velocity field, the radial component of Poynting's Vector resulted from the Liénard–Wiechert field can be calculated to be
Note that
Integrating Eq. (4) over the all solid angles, we get relativistic generalization of Larmor's formula
However, this also can be derived by relativistic transformation of the 4-acceleration in Larmor's formula.

Velocity ⊥ acceleration: synchrotron radiation

cone like the beam of a headlight pointing ahead of the particle. A plot of the angular distribution (dP/dΩ vs. γθ) shows a sharp peak around θ=0.
Integration over the whole solid angle yields the total power radiated by one electron

Radiation integral

The energy received by an observer (per unit solid angle at the source) is
Using the Fourier Transformation we move to the frequency space
Angular and frequency distribution of the energy received by an observer (consider only the radiation field)
Therefore, if we know the particle's motion, cross products term, and phase factor, we could calculate the radiation integral. However, calculations are generally quite lengthy (even for simple cases as for the radiation emitted by an electron in a bending magnet, they require Airy function or the modified Bessel functions).

Example 1: bending magnet

=Integrating=

Trajectory of the arc of circumference is
In the limit of small angles we compute

=Frequency distribution of radiated energy=

, and ''critical angle is defined as
For frequencies much larger than the critical frequency and angles much larger than the critical angle, the synchrotron radiation emission is negligible.
Integrating on all angles, we get the frequency distribution of the energy radiated.
If we define
The formula for spectral distribution of synchrotron radiation, given above, can be expressed in terms of a rapidly converging integral with no special functions involved M.Kh. Cascade Processes of Energy Loss by Emission of Hard Photons // JETP, V.99, No.4, pp. 690-707 \ (2004). (see also modified Bessel functions ) by means of the relation:

=Synchrotron radiation emission as a function of the beam energy=

First, define the critical photon energy as
Then, the relationship between radiated power and photon energy is shown in the graph on the right side. The higher the critical energy, the more photons with high energies are generated. Note that, there is no dependence on the energy at longer wavelength.

=Polarization of synchrotron radiation=

Integrating on all frequencies, we get the angular distribution of the energy radiated
Integrating on all the angles, we find that seven times as much energy is radiated with parallel polarization as with perpendicular polarization. The radiation from a relativistically moving charge is very strongly, but not completely, polarized in the plane of motion.

Example 2: undulator

=Solution of equation of motion and undulator equation=

An undulator consists of a periodic array of magnets, so that they provide a sinusoidal magnetic field.
Solution of equation of motion is
where,
, and
Condition for the constructive interference of radiation emitted at different poles is
Therefore,
This equation is called the undulator equation.

=Radiation from the undulator=

Radiation integral is
, and
The radiation integral in an undulator can be written as
and,
Note that only odd harmonics are radiated on-axis, and as K increases higher harmonic becomes stronger.
