Ricardo Antonio Mayorga Perez "El Matador" (born October 3, 1973 in Granada, Nicaragua) is a Nicaraguan professional boxer. He is the former WBA/WBC Welterweight champion and the former WBC light middleweight champion. He holds a record of 29-8 with 23 knockouts and 1 draw 1 no contest. He was featured for the first time on the cover of Ring Magazine on the December 2003 issue, released in October. The cover read "The craziest man in the sport: Mayorga lights up boxing." He is known for his relentless trash-talking before most of his fights and his smoking and drinking habits outside the ring. He started his career on August 29, 1993 when he lost to Humberto Aranda by a 6th round TKO and after that, he stayed undefeated until he lost again to Roger Benito Flores by UD in the Gimnasio Alexis Arguello in Managua, Nicaragua. He is known for his slow style and to opponents who are not afraid to punch him, he is a very easy target. Ever since he made his debut in 1993, he has captured 3 titles mostly in the Middleweight and Welterweight divisions.

Retirement from Boxing

On March 12, 2011, Mayorga faced Miguel Cotto, in what was a deeply personal feud. During the bout Mayorga suffered a broken finger and in the 12th round, he motioned for the referee to stop the fight. After the match Mayorga announced his retirement from boxing, (he apparently had already made up his mind before the bout and would retire regardless of the outcome) and stated that it was "time to find a new job". Mayorga and Cotto then hugged.
He has since stated that he does not entirely dismiss the possibility of a comeback. Sources close to Mayorga predict between Ricardo Mayorga and Antonio Margarito that's supposedly going to be dubbed: "When villains collide". The winner of the fight having one final shot at resurrecting his career and the loser retiring from boxing, a fight that will entertain fans not only in a press conference, but also in the ring as well.
On March 23, 2013, more rumors came up about Mayorga's future. The rumours implied that Mayorga might take part in a fight against the undefeated Russian middleweight: Dmitry Chudinov, on the undercard of the Denis Lebedev vs. Guillermo Jones fight, but eventually the fight did not take place.

Mixed Martial Arts career

Mayorga was scheduled to make his debut 15 May 2010 against UFC veteran Din Thomas in the Shine Fights: Worlds Collide: Mayorga vs. Thomas card. Don King filed for an injunction the week of the fight to prevent him from participating, claiming Mayorga had an exclusive contract with Don King Promotions (DKP).
Shine Fights stated that Mayorga's contract with DKP was for boxing, and as such did not apply to mixed martial arts. Judge Marc Gold granted the injunction just several hours before the fight.sherdog.
At the press conference, he was seen typically smoking cigarettes and looked a lot heavier than he usually does. Mayorga got under Thomas' skin with his trash talking and by blowing smoke in Thomas' face. Thomas reacted badly having to be held back by members of his camp, then after it settled Mayorga chopped Thomas in the neck.
Following his retirement from boxing, Mayorga decided to properly embark on a professional MMA career and faced Wesley Tiffer on May 3, 2013. Mayorga was kept on the ground but able to survive round 1. Tiffer continued to grapple with Mayorga on the ground until a controversial illegal knee by Mayorga to Tiffer's spine where he was heard screaming after the blow. Mayorga won via TKO after Tiffer didn't answer the bell on round 3. On May 10, 2013 the Nicaraguan Mixed Martial Arts Commission declared the fight as No Contest for the illegal knee, and suspended Mayorga for 3 months for being 20 pounds over the contracted weight limit of 165-lbs.boxingscene.com/mayorga-makes-mma-debut-secures-tko-victory--65140
