The North American X-15 was a rocket-powered aircraft operated by the United States Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as part of the X-plane series of experimental aircraft. The X-15 set speed and altitude records in the 1960s, reaching the edge of outer space and returning with valuable data used in aircraft and spacecraft design. ." Aerospaceweb.
During the X-15 program, 13 different flights by eight pilots met the USAF spaceflight criterion by exceeding the altitude of  thus qualifying the pilots for astronaut status. The USAF pilots qualified for USAF astronaut wings immediately, while the civilian pilots were awarded NASA astronaut wings in 2005, 35 years after the last X-15 flight.  The sole USN pilot in the X-15 program never took the aircraft above the requisite 50 mile altitude. 10."NASA astronaut wings award ceremony". NASA Press Release, 23 August 2005.
Of all the X-15 missions, two flights (by the same pilot) qualified as space flights per the international (Fédération Aéronautique Internationale) definition of a spaceflight by exceeding  in altitude.

Design and development

The X-15 was based on a concept study from Walter Dornberger for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) for a hypersonic research aircraft.Käsmann 1999, p. 105. The requests for proposal were published on 30 December 1954 for the airframe and on 4 February 1955 for the rocket engine. The X-15 was built by two manufacturers: North American Aviation was contracted for the airframe in November 1955, and Reaction Motors was contracted for building the engines in 1956.
Like many X-series aircraft, the X-15 was designed to be carried aloft on, and drop launched from, the wing of a NASA B-52 mother ship, the Balls 8. Release took place at an altitude of about ."X-15 launch from B-52 mothership." Dryden Flight Research Center Photo Collection. Retrieved: 8 February 2011. The X-15 fuselage was long and cylindrical, with rear fairings that flattened its appearance, and thick, dorsal and ventral wedge-fin stabilizers. Parts of the fuselage were heat-resistant nickel alloy (Inconel-X 750). The retractable landing gear comprised a nose-wheel carriage and two rear skis. The skis did not extend beyond the ventral fin, which required the pilot to jettison the lower fin (fitted with a parachute) just before landing.

Cockpit and pilot systems

The X-15 was a research program and changes were made to various systems over the course of the program and between the different models. The X-15 was operated under several different scenarios including attachment to a carrier aircraft, drop, main engine start and acceleration, a ballistic flight into thin air/space, re-entry into thicker air, and an unpowered glide to landing. Alternatively, if the main engine was not started the pilot went directly to a landing. The main rocket engine operated only for a relatively short part of the flight, but was capable of boosting the X-15 to its high speeds and altitudes. Without main engine thrust, the X-15's instruments and control surfaces remained functional, but the aircraft could not maintain altitude.
Because the X-15 also had to be controlled in an environment where there was too little air for aerodynamic surfaces, it had a reaction control system (RCS) that used rocket thrusters. There were two different X-15 pilot control setups: one used three joysticks; the other, one joystick.
The X-15 type with multiple control sticks for the pilot included a traditional rudder and stick, and another joystick on the left which sent commands to the reaction control system. A third joystick on the right side was used during high-G maneuvers to augment the center stick. In addition to pilot input, the X-15 "Stability Augmentation System" (SAS) sent inputs to the aerodynamic controls to help the pilot maintain attitude control.  The reaction control system could be operated in two modes, manual and automatic. The automatic mode used a feature called "Reaction Augmentation System" (RAS) that helped stabilize the vehicle during high altitudes. and Wilton P. Lock. "Operational Experience With the X-15 Reaction Control and Reaction Augmentation Systems." NASA, TN D-2864, 1965.  The RAS was typically used for approximately three minutes of an X-15 flight before automatic power off.
The second setup used the MH-96 flight control system which allowed one joystick in place of three and simplified pilot input."Forty Years ago in the X-15 Flight Test Program, November 1961–March 1962." Goleta Air & Space Museum. Retrieved: 3 October 2011. The MH-96 could automatically blend aerodynamic and rocket controls depending on how effective each system was at controlling the aircraft.
Among the many other controls, were the rocket engine throttle and a control for ejecting the ventral tail fin. Other features of the cockpit were heated windows to prevent icing, and a forward headrest for periods of high deceleration.
The X-15 had an ejection seat that allowed ejection at speeds up to Mach 4 and/or  with nitrogen gas, and oxygen for breathing was fed separately to the pilot.

Engines and fuel

Early flights used two Reaction Motors XLR11 engines. Later flights were undertaken with a single Reaction Motors Inc XLR99 rocket engine generating 
The XLR11 used ethyl alcohol and liquid oxygen, and the XLR99 used ammonia and liquid oxygen as fuel. The X-15 reaction control system (RCS), for maneuvering in low-pressure/density environment, used hydrogen peroxide as a monopropellant. More specifically, it was high-test peroxide (HTP), which decomposes into water and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst, and could provide a specific impulse of 140 seconds. 8.28. The HTP also fueled a turbopump for the main engines and auxiliary power units (APUs). "X-15 Pilot Report, Part 1: X-15 General Description & Walkaround." SierraFoot. Retrieved: 30 September 2011. Additional tanks for helium and liquid nitrogen performed other functions, for example the fuselage interior was purged with helium gas, and the liquid nitrogen was used as coolant for various systems.

Wedge tail and hypersonic stability

The X-15 had a thick wedge tail for stability at hypersonic speeds. Stillwell - X-15 Research Results With a Selected Bibliography (NASA SP-60, 1965) However, this produced a lot of drag at slower speeds. In fact, the blunt end of the X-15 could produce as much drag as an entire F-104 Starfighter.
Additionally, stability at hypersonic speeds was aided by side panels that could extend out from the tail to further increase area, and these panels doubled as air-brakes.

Operational history

Altitudes attained by X-15 aircraft do not match those of Alan Shepard's and Gus Grissom's Project Mercury space capsules in 1961, nor of any other manned spacecraft.  However, the X-15 ranks supreme among manned rocket-powered aircraft, becoming the world's first operational spaceplane in the early 1960s.
Before 1958, USAF and NACA officials discussed an orbital X-15 spaceplane, the X-15B that would launch into outer space from atop an SM-64 Navaho missile.  This was canceled when the NACA later became NASA and NASA adopted Project Mercury instead.
By 1959, the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar space-glider program became the USAF's preferred means for launching military manned spacecraft into orbit; however, this program was canceled in the early 1960s before an operational vehicle could be built.  Various configurations of the Navajo were considered, and another proposal involved a Titan I stage.
Three X-15s were built, flying 199 test flights, the last on 24 October 1968.
The first X-15 flight was an unpowered test flight by Albert Scott Crossfield, on 8 June 1959. Crossfield also piloted the first powered flight, on 17 September 1959, and his first flight with the XLR-99 rocket engine on 15 November 1960. Twelve test pilots flew the X-15. Among these were Neil Armstrong, later a NASA astronaut, and Joe Engle, later a commander of NASA Space Shuttle test flights.
In a 1962 proposal, NASA considered using the B-52/X-15 as a launch platform for a Blue Scout rocket to place satellites up to  into orbit."X-15/Blue Scout." Encyclopedia Astronautica.

In July and August 1963, pilot Joseph A. Walker exceeded .
On 15 November 1967, U.S. Air Force test pilot Major Michael J. Adams was killed during X-15 Flight 191 when the (X-15-3) entered a hypersonic spin while descending, then oscillated violently as aerodynamic forces increased after re-entry. As his aircraft's flight control system operated the control surfaces to their limits, acceleration built to 15 g vertical and 8.0 g lateral.  The airframe broke apart at . In 1991, his name was added to the Astronaut Memorial.
The second X-15A was rebuilt after a landing accident. It was lengthened . in October 1967, flown by William "Pete" Knight of the U.S. Air Force.
Five aircraft were used during the X-15 program:  three X-15s planes and two B-52 bombers:
A 200th flight over Nevada was first scheduled for 21 November 1968, to be flown by William "Pete" Knight. Numerous technical problems and outbreaks of bad weather delayed this proposed flight six times, and it was permanently canceled on 20 December 1968. This X-15 was detached from the B-52 and then put into indefinite storage. The aircraft was later donated to the museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for display.
