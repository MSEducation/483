Perospirone (Lullan) is an atypical antipsychotic of the azapirone family.

Medical uses

Its primary uses are in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania.

Schizophrenia

In a clinical trial that compared it to haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia it was found to produce significantly superior overall symptom control.
A meta-analysis published in 2013 found that it is statistically significantly less efficacious than other second-generation antipsychotics.

Adverse effects

Has a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects than the other atypical antipsychotics, but still less than that seen with typical antipsychotics. It also tended to produce less severe extrapyramidal side effects than haloperidol in a clinical trial comparing the two (although statistical significance was not reached).
