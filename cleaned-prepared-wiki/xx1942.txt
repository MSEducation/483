The ColecoVision is Coleco Industries' second generation home video game console, which was released in August 1982. The ColecoVision offered near-arcade-quality graphics and gaming style along with the means to expand the system's basic hardware. Released with a catalog of 12 launch titles, with an additional 10 games announced for 1982, approximately 145 titles in total were published as ROM cartridges for the system between 1982 and 1984.
In 2009, IGN named the ColecoVision their 12th best video game console out of their list of 25, citing "its incredible accuracy in bringing current-generation arcade hits home."

History

Coleco licensed Nintendo's Donkey Kong as the official pack-in cartridge for all ColecoVision consoles, helping to boost the console's popularity. By Christmas of 1982, Coleco had sold more than 500,000 units,
The ColecoVision was distributed by CBS Electronics outside of North America, and was branded the CBS ColecoVision.
Sales quickly passed 1 million in early 1983,Video Game Maker Says 1st-Quarter Profit More Than Tripled, 1983-04-20 before the video game crash of 1983. By the beginning of 1984, quarterly sales of the ColecoVision had dramatically decreased.
Over the next 18 months, the Coleco company ramped down its video game division, ultimately withdrawing from the video game market by the end of the summer of 1985.
In 1986, Bit Corporation produced a ColecoVision clone called the Dina, which was sold in the United States by Telegames as the Telegames Personal Arcade.

Hardware

The main console unit consists of a 14×8×2 inch rectangular plastic case that houses the motherboard, with a cartridge slot on the right side and connectors for the external power supply and RF jack at the rear. The controllers connect into plugs in a recessed area on the top of the unit.
The design of the controllers is similar to that of Mattel's Intellivision—the controller is rectangular and consists of a numeric keypad and a set of side buttons. In place of the circular control disc below the keypad, the Coleco controller has a short, 1.5-inch joystick. The keypad is designed to accept a thin plastic overlay that maps the keys for a particular game. Each ColecoVision console shipped with two controllers.
All first-party cartridges and most third-party software titles feature a 12-second pause before presenting the game select screen. This delay results from an intentional loop in the console's BIOS to enable on-screen display of the ColecoVision brand. Companies like Parker Brothers, Activision, and Micro Fun bypassed this loop, which necessitated embedding portions of the BIOS outside the delay loop, further reducing storage available to actual game programming.

Nintendo Entertainment System

The Nintendo Entertainment System's design and technology was influenced by the ColecoVision. The two are very similar in specifications and hardware features such as tile-based sprites.
According to an interview with Japanese Investment firm magazine Nikkei Electronics,Niekki Magazine Nintendo famicom/NES origin interview Which is translated by GlitterBerri's Game Translations,Translation of Neikkis Nintendo Origins Interview. it is stated that before work on the Famicom began, Coleco employees visited Japan to show off the ColecoVision prototype. It apparently shocked them to see the high-tech visuals and technical features Coleco had at the time. Takao Sawano, a member of the development team, brought a full version home to let his family play it and were as equally impressed with it. Takao Sawano joined Uemera, the head of Famicom hardware design, and started designing the hardware based on the specifications of the ColecoVision console.
Uemura stated that it was the ColecoVision that technologically spurred him and the ColecoVision is what he had in mind when considering the image of the final product.
