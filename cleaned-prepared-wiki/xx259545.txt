Wilson T. King is the alias of multi-instrumentalist/songwriter and producer Tim Wilson.
He is the main exponent of the musical form he mentioned in his Blues Matters interview in May 2010, as "future blues." Both debut album, Follow Your First Mind and second release "Last of the Analogues" have received world-wide critical acclaim in such publications as Classic Rock, Guitar Player, Total Guitar, Blues Matters and "Blues Rock Magazine" . Wilson has caused debate amongst some in the blues/guitar community due to his comments about the state of modern blues; especially what he calls "karaoke blues" artists.
In an interview with Alternative Magazine Online and a BBC Radio interview, Wilson adopted an aggressive stance against "karaoke blues" artists, considering them nothing more than merchants of parody and pastiche.

Sound and style

His main guitar influences stylistically would seem to be  Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Dave Gilmour, Albert King and Duane Allman,while his voice takes a more modern laid-back approach eschewing the typical blues sound.
His compositions tend to vary from the very simplistic to near avant-garde while maintaining a modern feel with the bass lines tending to be crucial to the minimalist approach.
Lyrically, he has mentioned in frequent interviews, the influence of the poet Charles Bukowski.

Recordings

Follow Your First Mind was released in February 2010 via 19 Miles High and distributed through Interscope Digital Distribution. The album was recorded in Manhattan and in Wilson's home town of Newark-on-Trent, England, and mastered at Abbey Road Studios by Christian Wright.

The album was recorded in the US and UK and featured Josh Lattanzi of Norah Jones on bass and Dan Whitley brother of the late Blues Great Chris Whitley on Harmonica as guest players.

Future blues

According to an interview with Wilson in the December 2010 issue of Guitar Player Magazine, he is trying to push the blues in new directions by creating records that are void of the typical blues cliches. Lyrically and sonically adventurous, while still deeply embedded within the blues form, he calls the blues the DNA of his recordings.
