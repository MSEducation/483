Amateur career

As a teenager, Johnson attended James Madison Memorial High School, where he was on the hockey team.  He then played for the University of Wisconsin–Madison ice hockey team for three years under his father, legendary coach Bob Johnson. In 1977, during his first year at the university, he helped the Badgers win the NCAA national championship.  He was the first Badger to win the WCHA Rookie of the year. He went on to become the school's leading goal scorer and second all-time scorer. Johnson was also a two time All-American. His brother, Peter, also played at the university.

International and professional career


 (as coach)
Johnson made his international debut with the United States national team as an 18-year-old in 1976, when he played in 11 training games for the 1976 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team coached by his father. He represented the United States in 13 international tournaments (including the 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1990 Ice Hockey World Championship tournaments and the 1981, 1984 and 1987 Canada Cup). He was a star player on the U.S. Olympic Hockey team at the 1980 Lake Placid winter games. Playing for the United States against the Soviet Union, Johnson scored two of the four goals in the Team USA 4-3 victory.  He scored in the first period of the game, which directly led to the Soviet coach taking out his goalie, Vladislav Tretiak, who was considered the best goalie in the world at the time.  He also scored in the third period to tie the game at 3–3.  The team then went on to defeat Finland to capture the gold medal, with Johnson assisting on the game-winning goal and scoring the insurance goal with less than four minutes remaining in the game.
Johnson went on to play professional hockey in the NHL for the Pittsburgh Penguins, Minnesota North Stars, Hartford Whalers, St. Louis Blues, and New Jersey Devils - in his final season with New Jersey, he was a teammate of Slava Fetisov, who had played for the Soviets in Lake Placid. He played in the 1984 NHL All Star game as the Whalers representative and served as the Whalers team captain in 1983–85. He also played two seasons with Milan Saima SG in Italy and a final season in Austria before retiring from the game in 1992. He briefly came out of retirement to play two games for Team USA in the 1998 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships qualifying tournament at the age of 41, where he helped Team USA retain its position in the World Championships' Pool A.
In 2010, thirty years after winning the Olympic gold medal as a player, Johnson coached the United States women's national ice hockey team, which won a silver medal in the Vancouver games.
