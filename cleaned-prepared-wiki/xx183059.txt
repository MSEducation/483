[[Low carbon diet]]

CATEGORIES: Diets, Low-carbon economy, Sustainable food system

A low carbon diet refers to making lifestyle choices to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) resulting from energy use. 30, 2006 It is estimated that the U.S. food system is responsible for at least 20 percent of U.S. greenhouse gases.20% of GHGe from food industry This estimate may be low, as it counts only direct sources of GHGe. Indirect sources, such as demand for products from other countries, are often not counted. A low carbon diet minimizes the emissions released from the production, packaging, processing, transport, preparation and waste of food. Major tenets of a low carbon diet include eating less industrial meat and dairy, eating less industrially produced food in general, eating food grown locally and seasonally, eating less processed and packaged foods and reducing waste from food by proper portion size, recycling or composting.Randy Hall, "Low Carbon Diet' Aims to Take Bite Out of Global Warming," Cybercast News Service, April 18, 2007

Background on diet and greenhouse gas emissions

In the U.S., the food system emits four of the greenhouse gases associated with climate change: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are emitted from mechanical refrigerating and freezing mechanisms – both staples in food shipment and storage.  Anthropogenic nitrous oxide sources include fertilizer, manure, crop residues and nitrogen-fixing crops production.  2011.  Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks:  1990-2009.  United States Environmental Protection Agency.  EPA 430-R-11-005.  459 pp.  Methane and nitrous oxide are also emitted in large amounts from natural sources.  The 100-year global warming potentials of methane and nitrous oxide are recently estimated at 25 and 298 carbon dioxide equivalents, respectively.  2007.  Fourth Assessment Report.

Steinfeld et al. estimate that livestock production accounts for 18 percent of anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents. et al. 2006,  Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options.  Livestock, Environment and Development, FAO.   Of this amount, 34 percent is carbon dioxide emission from deforestation, principally in Central and South America, that they assigned to livestock production.  However, deforestation associated with livestock production is not an issue in many regions.  In the US, the land area occupied by forest increased between 1990 and 2009US EPA.  2011.

Part 1.  221 pp.
Of emissions they attribute to livestock production, Steinfeld et al. estimate that globally, methane accounts  for 30.2 percent.   Like other greenhouse gases, methane contributes to global warming when its atmospheric concentration rises.  Although methane emission from agriculture and other anthropogenic sources has contributed substantially to past warming, it is of much less significance for current and recent warming. This is because there has been relatively little increase in atmospheric methane concentration in recent years Dlugokencky, E. J. et al. 1998.

Letters, vol. 35, L22805, doi:10.1029/2008GL036037  The anomalous increase in methane concentration in 2007, discussed by Rigby et al., has since been attributed principally to anomalous methane flux from natural wetlands, mostly in the tropics, rather than to anthropogenic sources. et al. 2011.

Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents.   This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents.

High carbon and low carbon food choices

Certain foods require more fossil fuel inputs than others, making it possible to go on a low carbon diet and reduce one's carbon footprint by choosing foods that need less fossil fuel and therefore emit less carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
In June 2010, a report from United Nations Environment Programme declared that a global shift towards a vegan diet was needed to save the world from hunger, fuel shortages and climate change.[ref]Felicity Carus UN urges global move to meat and dairy-free diet, The Guardian, 2 June 2010

Industrial v. pastured livestock

Beef and dairy cattle can be particularly high in their levels of greenhouse gas emissions.  Feed is a significant contributor to emissions from animals raised in Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) or factory farms, as corn or soy beans must be fertilised, irrigated, processed into animal feed, packaged and then transported to the CAFO.  In 2005, CAFOs accounted for 74% of the world's poultry production, 50% of pork, 43% of beef, and 68% of eggs, according to the Institute.  Proportions are significantly higher in developed countries, but are growing rapidly in developing countries, where demand is also growing fast. 11-12  However, in the US, only about 11 percent of soybean acres and 14 percent of corn acres are irrigated; in contrast, about 66 percent of vegetable acres and 79 percent of orchard acres are irrigated.  2009.  2007 Census of agriculture.

Agricultural Statistics 2010.  505 pp. so that only a fraction of processing is assignable to feed.  Such examples illustrate that issues relating to irrigation, fertilization and processing for meat production should also be of concern with regard to production of other foods.
In one study, grass-fed cattle were estimated to account for 40% less greenhouse emissions than CAFO cattleBrian Halweil and Danielle Nierenberg, 2008, Meat and Seafood:  The Global Diet's Most Costly Ingredients, in The Worldwatch Institute's State of the World 2008, p. 65  However, comparative effects on emissions can vary.  in a US study, lower GHG emissions were associated with feedlot-finished beef production than with beef production on pasture and hay., R. Pirog, and R. Rasmussen.  2010.  Comparative life cycle environmental impacts of three beef production strategies in the Upper Midwestern United States.  Agric. Systems 103: 390-389.  Similarly, a study in New Zealand concluded that environmental emissions per kg of beef produced can be reduced by incorporating feedlot finishing in a beef production system. A., V. A. Snow and W. M. King.  2010.  Intensification of New Zealand beef farming systems. Agric. Systems 103: 21-36.  Another factor to be considered is the role of  a healthy pastoral ecosystem in carbon sequestration.  Rotational grazing of ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats, etc.) and birds (chickens, turkeys, etc.) on untilled pasture land promotes rapid topsoil accumulation, representing a major carbon sink.
Because CAFO production is highly centralised, the transport of animals to slaughter and then to distant retail outlets is a further source of greenhouse gas emissions.  However, this can be more or less compensated by reduced transport of feed, where CAFOs are located in feed-producing areas.
In livestock production, emissions are reduced by feeding human-inedible materials that might otherwise by wasted.  Elferink et al.  state that "Currently, 70 % of the feedstock used in the Dutch feed industry originates from the food processing industry."Elferink, E. V., S. Nonhebel and H. C. Moll.  2008.

Cleaner Prod. 16: 1227-1233  Among several US examples is the feeding of distillers grains remaining from biofuel production. For the marketing year 2009/2010, the amount of dried distillers grains used as livestock feed (and residual) in the US amounted to 25.0 million metric tons. and A. Baker. 2010.

Distance traveled and method of transit

Carbon emissions from transport account for 11% of the total carbon emissions of food, of which the transportation from producer to consumer accounts for 4%.newscientist.700-what-is-your-dinner-doing-to-the-climate.
When looking at total greenhouse gases (not just carbon dioxide), 83% of emissions come from the actual production of the food because of the methane released by livestock and the nitrous oxide due to fertilizer.
The word locavore describes a person attempting to eat a diet consisting of foods harvested from within a 100-mile radius.
Some studies have criticized the emphasis on local food, claiming that it romanticizes local production, but does not produce very much environmental benefit. Transportation accounts for a relatively small portion of overall energy consumption in food production, and locally produced food may be much more energy intensive than food produced in a better area. Additionally the emphasis on "inefficient" local producers over more efficient ones further away may be damaging.

Processing, packaging and waste

Highly processed foods such as granola bars come in individual packaging, demanding high energy inputs and resulting in packaging waste.
