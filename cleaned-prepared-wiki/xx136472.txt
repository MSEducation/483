Professional career

Little turned professional in 1983 and while he won his first four bouts, he soon started compiling losses. Even with a mediocre record, he fought for the WBO light-middleweight title against John David Jackson in 1989. He lost by a technical knockout. He retired for a short time after that fight.
In 1994 he scored an upset victory over Lineal/WBA super-middleweight champion Michael Nunn by split decision in London.  He lost the belt in his first defense to Frankie Liles, losing a decision.  Although he later fought James Toney and Arthur Williams, he never fought for another major title.
Besides being a professional boxer, Little also sold used cars in Reading. 
Little retired in 1998 and died from colon cancer in 2000, at the young age of 34.  He left behind a wife and six children... | Payday Blog News
