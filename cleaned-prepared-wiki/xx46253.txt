George Joseph Herriman (August 22, 1880 – April 25, 1944) was an American cartoonist best known for the comic strip Krazy Kat (1913–1944).  More influential than popular, Krazy Kat had an appreciative audience among people in the arts. Gilbert Seldes' article "The Krazy Kat Who Walks by Himself" was the earliest example of a critic from the high arts giving serious attention to a comic strip. The Comics Journal placed the strip first on its list of the greatest comics of the 20th century. Herriman's work has been a primary influence on cartoonists such as Will Eisner, Charles M. Schulz, Robert Crumb, Art Spiegelman, Bill Watterson, and Chris Ware.
Herriman was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to mulatto Creole parents, and grew up in Los Angeles.  After he graduated from high school in 1897, he was employed in the newspaper industry as an illustrator and engraver.  He moved on to cartooning and comic strips—a medium then in its infancy—and drew a variety of strips until he introduced his most famous character, Krazy Kat, in his strip The Dingbat Family in 1910.  A Krazy Kat daily strip began in 1913, and from 1916 also appeared on Sundays.  The strip was noted for its poetic, dialect-heavy dialogue; its fantastic, shifting backgrounds; and its bold, experimental page layouts.  In the strip's main motif, Ignatz Mouse would pelt Krazy with bricks, which the naïve, androgynous Kat would interpret as symbols of love. As the strip progressed, a love triangle developed between Krazy, Ignatz and Offisa Pupp.
Herriman lived most of his life in Los Angeles, but made frequent trips to the Navajo deserts in the southwestern U.S.  He was drawn to the landscapes of Monument Valley and the Enchanted Mesa, and made Coconino County the location of his Krazy Kat strips.  His artwork made much use of Navajo and Mexican themes and motifs against shifting desert backgrounds.  He was a prolific cartoonist who produced a large number of strips and illustrated Don Marquis's books of poetry about Archy and Mehitabel, an alley cat and a cockroach.  Newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst was a proponent of Herriman and gave him a lifetime contract with King Features Syndicate, guaranteeing Herriman a comfortable living and an outlet for his work despite its lack of popularity.

Personal history

Early life

George Joseph Herriman was born to 
When he was ten, Herriman and his family moved to Los Angeles,

Early career in New York (1900–1904)

When he was 20, Herriman sneaked aboard a freight train bound for New York City, hoping his chances as an artist would be better there.  He was unsuccessful at first, and survived by working as a barker and billboard painter at Coney Island, until one of the leading humor magazines of the day, Judge, accepted some of his cartoons.  Between June 15 and October 26, 1901, eleven of his cartoons appeared in that magazine's pages, in the heavily crosshatched style of the day.  He often used sequential images in his cartoons, as in the emerging comic strip medium.  On September 29 that year, his first real comic strips were published, one in the Pulitzer chain of newspapers on a non-contractual, one-shot basis and another on a continuing basis in the Philadelphia North American Syndicate's first comic strip supplement.  His first color comic strips appeared in the T. C. McClure Syndicate beginning October 20.
His success with these syndicated strips convinced Herriman to give up on magazine submissions.
In the November 1902 issue of the literary magazine The Bookman Herriman wrote of his profession self-deprecatingly, while poet La Touche Hancock, in an article in that issue titled "The American Comic and Caricature Art",
In June, Herriman was employed by the New York World.  There, he illustrated Roy McCardell's commentaries on local events, beginning June 28 and running to the year's end.  Herriman still produced syndicate work, such as Major Ozone's Fresh Air Crusade for the World Color Printing Company beginning January 2, 1904.  Another of Herriman's obsessive characters, the Major traveled the world in an unsuccessful search for the purest air and spouted poetic dialogue.
Rudolph Block hired Herriman for the Hearst papers with "a salary commensurate with his talents", starting April 22 at the New York American,

Return to California (1906–1910)

In California, Herriman continued to mail in work to the World Color Printing Company.  He revived Major Ozone and produced Grandma's Girl—Likewise Bud Smith, which he combined from two earlier strips, and a two-tiered children's strip, Rosy Posy—Mama's Girl.  He began to work with the Los Angeles Times on January 8, 1906, before returning to Hearst that summer.
Following the success of Bud Fisher's daily strip A. Mutt,

New York again, and Krazy Kat (1910–1922)

In 1910, the sports editor of the New York Evening Journal called Herriman back to New York to cover for Tad Dorgan who was in San Francisco covering the "Fight of the Century" between Jack Johnson and Jim Jeffries.
The gender of "Kat" was unclear from the start.  Herriman experimented with a decision about the character's gender, but it remained ambiguous and he would refer to "Kat" as "he" or "she" as he saw fit. Herriman incorporated unusual details into the mini-strip's backgrounds—cacti, pagodas, fanciful vegetation, or anything else that struck his fancy; this became a signature of the later Krazy Kat strip.  The cast grew and soon included the mainstay character Bull Pupp and characters from the Gooseberry Sprigg strip.
The cat-and-mouse substrip was gaining in popularity; instead of filling up space in the bottom of The Dingbat Family
During the first few years of publication, Krazy Kat
Herriman visited Monument Valley in Arizona and similar places in New Mexico and southern Utah, and incorporated the distinct forms of the desert landscape into his strips.  The Enchanted Mesa of New Mexico first appeared in Krazy Kat in the summer of 1916.  Herriman may have visited after reading an article by Theodore Roosevelt in 1913, but he may have gone earlier—the desert Coconino County, Arizona, that became the backdrop to Krazy Kat was first mentioned in a 1911 Dingbat Family strip,

The Dingbat Family finished in 1916 and was replaced by Baron Bean

Krazy Kat gained an appreciative audience in the world of the arts.  The character debuted in film in 1916.  The first animated films starring a cat were produced by Hearst's International Film Service, though without Herriman's direct involvement.

California again, later career and death (1922–1944)

Hearst, an admirer of Krazy Kat, had given Herriman a lifetime contract with his company King Features Syndicate,
Autumn 1922 saw the first daily installment of Stumble Inn, the first non-Krazy Kat strip Herriman had drawn since 1919.  A verbose strip whose Sundays were often overrun with prose, its lead characters were Uriah and Ida Stumble, who rented rooms to an assortment of strange characters.  The daily strip was short-lived, but the Sundays edition lasted three years.
From August 1925 until September 1929, King Features required that Herriman design the Krazy Kat Sundays so that they could be run either as a full Sunday page or as two four-panel dailies.  Herriman lamented intrusion on his page designs, and the artwork of the period took on a rushed look.  He was made to focus on the strip's characterization, and during this period, the Krazy—Ignatz—Offisa Pupp love triangle for which the strip is remembered became fully developed.  Pupp pined for Krazy, Krazy loved Ignatz, and Ignatz hated Krazy and pelted the annoying "Kat" with a brick, and Pupp imprisoned Ignatz.
Throughout the late 1920s, Herriman made frequent trips to Kayenta, Arizona, in Navajo country about 
Stumble Inn finished in late 1925, and it was replaced with the domestic strip Us Husbands (with Mistakes Will Happen as a "topper" strip), which ran until the end of that year.
In 1930, Herriman sold his first Hollywood home to a friend and moved his family to 2217 Maravilla Drive, a Spanish-style mansion atop a hill.  It was adorned with paintings of Southwest and Native themes, and had a Mexican-style garden paved with flagstones and decorated with painted pots and tropical plants.  Herriman later bought the lot across the street and turned it into a public park.
The 1930s were a period of tragedy for Herriman.  On September 29, 1931, his wife Mabel died after an automobile accident,
Krazy Kat
Herriman died in his sleep in his home near Hollywood on April 25, 1944, after a long illness.
On June 25, 1944, two months after Herriman's death, the last of his completed Krazy Kat strips, a full-page Sunday, was printed.

Personal life

Herriman was described as self-deprecatingly modest, and he disliked being photographed.
Herriman had a great love of animals, and had a large number of dogs and cats;
Herriman married his childhood sweetheart Mabel Lillian Bridge in Los Angeles on July 7, 1902.

Race and identity

Herriman was born to mixed-race parents,
Herriman's ethnic heritage was unknown to his colleagues.  Fellow cartoonist Tad Dorgan nicknamed him "the Greek", a label which stuck and was taken up by his biographers and the press, who called him the son of a Greek baker.
His mixed-race heritage was made known in 1971 when sociologist Arthur Asa Berger discovered that Herriman's race was listed by the New Orleans Board of Health as "colored", and that the 1880 census listed his parents as "mulatto".

Reception and legacy

Krazy Kat was popular with intellectuals, artists and critics,
Herriman's illustrations for Archy and Mehitabel were praised by writer E. B. White.
Herriman's work was difficult for critics to classify and contextualize; Seldes, 
The strip has had a lasting influence on a large number of cartoonists.  Mutts creator Patrick McDonnell calls Krazy Kat one of his foremost influences,

Krazy Kat was a primary influence on other cartoonists such as Charles M. Schulz of Peanuts,
Since 1997, the Small Press Expo has held the annual Ignatz Awards in honor of Herriman's mouse from Krazy Kat.  It recognizes talent in independent comics publishing.

Work

Style

Within the seeming strictures of the strip—the recurring characters, the Krazy–Ignatz–Offisa Pupp love triangle—Herriman improvised freely with the story, the shifting backgrounds, and the sex of the Krazy Kat

Herriman drew with what cartoonist Edward Sorel called a "liberated, spontaneous-looking style ... a cartoon counterpart of expressionism".

Collections

Krazy Kat has been collected in a variety of formats over the years, though Herriman's other strips have been less frequently reprinted.  George Herriman's Krazy Kat (1946) was the first Krazy Kat collection;
