Professional career

NBA career

The Cavaliers re-signed Davis on August 21, 2002 to a six year contract.  Davis' time with Cleveland was marked by disputes with then head coach Paul Silas.  On March 16, 2003, in the closing seconds of a game against Utah, Davis was one rebound short of his first career triple-double. In an unsuccessful effort to record that rebound, Davis deliberately missed a shot at his team's own basket. Afterwards, he was fouled by Utah's DeShawn Stevenson in retaliation for his perceived unsportsmanlike behavior, and was later fined by his own team.www.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2004/04/14/Sports/Nba-Ruling.TripleDouble.shtml NBA ruling thwarts triple-double attempt Cavs' Davis fined for trying to pad stats

At the beginning of his career Davis was considered a one-dimensional, though potentially prolific, player.

As a Boston Celtic, Davis lived up to his reputation as both a crowd-pleaser and showboat, once attempting a between-the-legs dunk during a regular season game against the rival Los Angeles Lakers during the 2003–2004 season.  Although Davis missed the dunk, he quickly recovered to deliver a windmill dunk before any Lakers could get back on the defensive end of the court.
After successfully creating his first ever fan club, Ricky D's Renegades, who were a group of high schoolers that cheered with great intensity at every Cav's home game during the 2002–2003 and 2003–04 seasons, Davis organized a contest to distribute 15 season tickets to his most passionate fans after being traded to Boston.  The section was called the Get Buckets Brigade, named after his nickname "Get Buckets", which he got for his high scoring rate.Ricky Davis Official Website
