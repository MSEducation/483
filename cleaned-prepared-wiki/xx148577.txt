(Randall) Crawford.1880 United States Census; Census Place: Colebrook, Coos, New Hampshire; Roll: 762; Family History Film: 1254762; Page: 31A; Enumeration District: 31; Image: 0063. Crawford and his date of birth as March 12, 1870 in Colebrook, New Hampshire.  He attended preparatory school at St. Johnsbury Academy in St. Johnsbury, Vermont.  He enrolled at Yale University, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1891.  Sources are at odds over whether or not Crawford played football for the Yale Bulldogs football team.  According to the University of Nebraska web site, Crawford was "a member of the dominant Yale teams of the mid-1880s."  The Michigan Daily also reported that Crawford played football at Yale "for several years."  However, the University of Michigan web site notes that "Yale archivists found no evidence that he played varsity football" and concludes that Crawford "may have played some football while a Bulldog, but definitely did not win a varsity letter."

Coaching career

University of Michigan

After graduating from Yale, Crawford enrolled at the University of Michigan School of Law, receiving his law degree in 1893.  As a first-year law student, Crawford was both the unpaid coach and a substitute player for the 1891 Michigan Wolverines football team.
While attending Michigan, Crawford also played for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team in 1892 and 1893.  He led the team with a .976 fielding average in 1892.  Crawford appeared in 17 games at catcher and left field for the Wolverines in 1892 and was among the team's leaders in runs (tied for 2nd with 20), stolen bases (tied for 2nd with 13) and putouts (2nd with 115).
In his history of the University of Michigan, Wilfred Byron Shaw cites Crawford's hiring as a watershed moment in the history of the school's football program: "A new era in the history of football at Michigan began in 1891, when with a fair schedule and an experienced coach, Frank Crawford (Yale, '91), '93l, the systematic development of a team began ..."

After starting the 1893 season with a 2–2–1 record, Crawford's team defeated Iowa, 20–18, in a match played in near-blizzard conditions and considered the "first major victory" in Nebraska history.  Crawford reportedly also played right halfback and kicked the field goals for Nebraska during the 1893 Iowa game; he was identified in the record book as "Frank."  In 1894, Crawford's team defeated Iowa, 36–0. The 1895 team finished the season with five consecutive victories for a 7–2 record and the school's first ever conference championship.  During Crawford's tenure at Nebraska, George Flippin played for Crawford and became the first African-American athlete in Nebraska history.

In 1894, the University of Texas football team suffered its first loss in school history, a 28–0 home loss to Missouri.  The previous head coach was fired, and a lengthy search was conducted for a replacement.  In October 1895, Texas hired Crawford.  At Texas, he was known as "Little" Crawford and reportedly "taught the Yale system of play and stressed conditioning."  Crawford led the 1895 Longhorns to a perfect 5–0 record, as the team outscored its opponents by a combined 96–0 margin.  After a Thanksgiving Day victory over San Antonio by a score of 38–0, Crawford reportedly left for Mexico to watch bullfights and then returned to his home in Nebraska.
