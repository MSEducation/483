Relation with Jews

In their fight against "cosmopolitanism", party members have in the past espoused in what was seen as anti-Semitic views. In 2005  the official organ of the party, newspaper "The Nation and Power",  published an article which said: "The titular nation in Ukraine (ethnic Ukrainians) will disappear in 2006.... After the 2006 election, Ukrainians will dance around the Jews.".12.05-2.01.06 (translation from Ukrainian) In his speech at the opening of the Holodomor Memorial in November 2007, the Head of the party in Zaporizhia Oblast Tymchina stated: "Our time has come, and the Dnieper will soon be red with the blood of Kikes (slur for Jews) and Moskals (slur for Russians)."«Украина криминальная», 29 ноября 2007, 14:15 The Kommersant newspaper on 26 January 2010 quoted the head of the Kiev city organization Yuri Shepetyuk saying: "There is no anti-Semitism in Ukraine. The Jews themselves organize various provocations, and then talk about the persecution in their address, to get even more funding from abroad". Kommersant notes: "However, he (Yuri Shepetyuk) did not specify what provocations were staged in Ukraine by representatives of the Jewish community."
However, as of recently the official website the party appears to express support for Zionism and Israel (although not the Israeli government, for prosecuting Demjanjuk), and regards Ze'ev Jabotinsky as a hero, as it features articles by Moysey Fishbein Article on Zionism and Ukrainian Nationalism by Mr. Fishbein (Ukrainian-language) as well as a few other articles, although the party does defend alleged Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk; who they believe is wrongly accused. It would seem as though most anti-semitism has been removed from the party in light of the new support for Israel.

The flag of the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists is a rectangular two-color banner with two horizontal halves. The upper half is red and the bottom half is black.
