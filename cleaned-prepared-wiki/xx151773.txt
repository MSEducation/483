Oracle Linux, formerly known as Oracle Enterprise Linux, is a Linux distribution based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), repackaged and freely distributed by Oracle, available under the GNU General Public License (GPL) since late 2006.
Oracle Linux can be downloaded through Oracle's E-delivery service or from a variety of mirror sites, and can be deployed and distributed without cost.e. without reinstallationSwitching from Red Hat Network to Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN)).

RHEL compatibility

Oracle Corporation distributes Oracle Linux with two alternative kernels:

Oracle claims that the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel is compatible with RHEL, and that Oracle middleware and third-party RHEL-certified applications can install and run unchanged on the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel. However, for users requiring strict compatibility with Red Hat or for users running kernel modules dependent on specific kernel versions, the Red Hat Compatible Kernel offers 100% compatibility with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Benchmark submissions

Sun Fire systems

In March 2012, Oracle submitted a TPC-C benchmark result using a Sun Fire server running Oracle Linux and Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel.06 million tpmC (New-Order transactions per minute while fulfilling TPC-CFrequently Asked Questions What is TPC-C?). The server is the third fastest TPC-C non-clustered system and is the fastest x86-64 non-clustered system.8M wasn't enough so we went for 5.055M tpmc with Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel r2 :-)
Oracle also submitted a SPECjEnterprise2010 benchmark record using Oracle Linux and Oracle WebLogic Server, and achieved both a single node and an x86 world record result of 27,150 EjOPS (SPECjEnterprise Operation/second).1.1 on Oracle Sun Fire X4800 M2
