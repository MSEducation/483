Bad Girls Club (BGC) is an American reality television series created by Jonathan Murray The show focuses on the altercations and physical confrontations of seven highly aggressive, quarrelsome, and unruly women. Each of the women tend to have psychological and behavioral problems. Mischievously sexual and rascally moments are also captured among the women. All seven women have different backgrounds and personalities. They are introduced to the show based off their capacity to be a "charismatic, tough chick." The cast, deemed "bad girls", enjoy a luxurious lifestyle in a fine mansion for three months, during which they must obey specified rules. Their lives inside and outside of the house are chronicled and recorded by the production team.
Bad Girls Club airs in three nations besides the United States; MTV Australia, RTL 5 in The Netherlands, and TV11 in Sweden, and as of December 2013 has not been licensed to a broadcaster in another nation for a local version of the series. The program has been negatively reviewed by critics for the effect it may have on teenagers, and the negative attitudes and remarks of the cast members have caused outrage to some viewers.
The format of the show has changed from early seasons. If a "Bad" Girl breaks a rule, she is evicted from the show and, if it is early in the season, replaced by a new "Bad Girl". The fourth season is considered the series' "breakthrough season", becoming Oxygen's first series ever to average over one million viewers per episode.
There have been four spin-offs of the Bad Girls Club. Bad Girls Road Trip, Tanisha Gets Married, Love Games: Bad Girls Need Love Too - where past cast members seek true love, and Bad Girls All-Star Battle.
Of all the contestants, Kerry Harvick (of season one) was a successful country singer before the show. has her own reality television series entitled Tanisha Gets Married. As of Season 8, she's also been the host of the Bad Girls Club  and Bad Girls All-Star Battle reunion specials.

Format

A central goal of the show has become who can last until the final day. Lasting until the final day without ever being kicked out or leaving for another reason is treated as an impressive feat on the series due to the level of violence and hostility. If the cast members engage in violence towards each other or break other rules, they may or may not be evicted under the show's policy, which is whimsically and fickly enforced by the producers. Security guards apparently live in the house behind the scenes as they jump into camera shot to break up the many violent altercations that break out on the series. Beyond the common occurrence of violence and combat, other reasons for the premature exits of cast members have been fatigue from bullying, ostracism and alienation from the rest of the housemates, problems at home, court proceedings, or their own narcissism. On some occasions, multiple "bad girls" may wish to leave the show; this has happened in all seasons. If a girl departs early in the season, a "replacement Bad Girl" is introduced within one or two episodes. The replacement housemate is commonly hazed, aggressed at, and treated with prejudice.
All or most of the girls typically form cliques between each other; create havoc and antagonize each other; book parties in night clubs; and engage in sexual antics and other mischief, all awhile attempting to maintain their personal lives. Bullying and outnumbering gang attacks (where multiple cast members intimidate one cast member or some other fewer number of cast members) are among regular occurrences on the program. The girls, deemed "bad girls", come from different backgrounds and all different walks of life.
Throughout the show, the "Bad Girls" must adapt to the frequent mood and behavior changes of their housemates. The girls must undergo interviews in reality TV confessionals. They are allowed to contact their families and friends using landline telephones and a computer connected to a large-screen television; however, the cast is prohibited from watching nationally and locally televised programming and using mobile phones.
The Bad Girls Club creed, introduced in season three, is:

Seasons 1 and 2

The format for the first season of Bad Girls Club was different from that of subsequent seasons. The age range for season one was from 21 to 31. The use of nicknames was not introduced until the third season. Season one was the first in which multiple "replacement Bad Girls" entered the show.
Although there were differences in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one was the way the show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of who is going to be the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.
In the second season, the format of the show changed drastically. The maximum age dropped from 31 to 27. The cast of season two were given mandatory non-profit jobs to help them build a work ethic and to experience the stabilizing effect of being interdependent with others, for example in teamwork and commitment, to equip them for success in later life. Quitting the job or failure to attend resulted in mandatory removal from the show. The girls were given the jobs of planning, decision making, and building cooperation. Season two was the first and only season of the Bad Girls Club to do this, and was also the last to air 30-minute episodes.

Live shows

On August 3, 2010, during the OxygenLive TV recap episode, the show combined Facebook and Twitter with a live broadcast. Fans submitted opinions and comments about the show and its cast, which were aired during the 10Â pm hour.
In January 2011, Oxygen released OxygenLive!, an online talk show hosted by Tanisha Thomas, one of the "bad girls" of season two. It was broadcast after season six debuted on Oxygen, and focused on the cast of season six, occasionally bringing in "Bad Girls" from earlier seasons. Thomas asked the girls several questions to prompt rumors and confessions.

Reception

Many homophobic slurs have caught the attention of media outlets. and wrote, "Just like some teens try to emulate rappers in their dress and behavior, the same is true for 'bad girls. '" She also commented that the show gives a "distorted picture" of how to live the good life, calling the cast "wannabes" who are "sleeping in a mansion they can't pay for". Mitchell believes that most people know the cast are living "a bogus lifestyle", and assesses the message of the Bad Girls Club as "disturbing".
Many adolescents have emulated The Bad Girls Club
Brian Lowry of Variety thought that the producers made the "wrong decision" when they created the show. He believed that the cast of Bad Girls Club auditioned for the show for their "15 minutes of fame". He said that Bad Girls Club "arrived a little late in this game, on a channel lacking the kind of exposure or public footprint to qualify the show even as the stuff guilty pleasures are made of". Lowry believed that the show "loses" and that Oxygen attracts viewers who generally get drunk at bars and make a scene. He also suggested that "maybe it's time to "BAG" these bad-attitude girls and beat a hasty retreat back to the real world".
Anita Gates of The New York Times referred to Bad Girls Club as "a great argument for bringing back programming with actors". She believed that the "average emotional age" appeared to be 15, in contrast to the girls' real ages. She stated that the "unpleasant villains cancel one another out and actually make badness uninteresting", commenting that their behavior might not be "bad enough". Gates concluded by suggesting that Bad Girls Club is the on-location equivalent of The Jerry Springer Show.

Controversies

Season 4

During "Off The Wall", the first episode of the fourth season, Natalie Nunn told Annie Andersen that Chris Brown was at a night club that she wanted to attend, and asked Anderson if she was a fan.

Shortly before the end of the reunion, Nunn said that she did not condone domestic violence and apologized if her comment had enraged fans and people who had been victims of it.

Guinane reported that the producers of the show did not want to identify the man on television for fear of a lawsuit.
