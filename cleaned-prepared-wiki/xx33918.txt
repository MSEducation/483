Terry Edward Branstad (born November 17, 1946) is an American politician who is the 42nd and current governor of Iowa, having held the office since January 2011. Branstad was also the 39th governor of Iowa from 1983 to 1999, and President of Des Moines University from 2003 to 2009. He is a member of the Republican Party. Branstad is the longest-serving governor in Iowa history, and the second-longest serving governor in U.S. history (behind George Clinton of New York).
In his 2010 political comeback, Branstad won a three-way primary election for the Republican nomination to run for governor in the general election. He faced incumbent Governor Chet Culver, a Democrat, and four third party candidates on November 2, 2010.
Branstad entered the 2010 race as the front runner for both the primary and general elections. Independent polling in 2009 indicated that his approval ratings hovered in the 70% range. He won the Republican primary with 50.4% of the popular vote, 9.5 percentage points ahead of his nearest competitor.
On January 15, 2014, Branstad officially launched his re-election campaign for what would be an unprecedented sixth four-year term as Iowa governor, which would also make him the longest-serving governor in U.S. history (breaking the record held by George Clinton of New York, who served 21 years from 1777 to 1795, and from 1801 to 1804).

Early life

Born to a Norwegian-American Lutheran farming family in Leland, Iowa, Branstad received his undergraduate degree from the University of Iowa and his law degree from Drake University Law School. In 1989, he was named an honorary member of Alpha Gamma Rho Fraternity at Iowa State University.

Early political career

Branstad served three terms in the Iowa House of Representatives from 1973 to 1979 and served as the 41st Lieutenant Governor of Iowa from 1979 to 1983, when he was elected Governor of Iowa.

Governor of Iowa (1983–1999)

When elected governor at age 36, Branstad was the youngest chief executive in Iowa's history and when he left office, was Iowa's longest-serving governor. He served as Chair of the National Governors Association during 1989–1990, and was Chair of the Midwestern Governors Association. In 1997, he chaired the Education Commission of the States, the Republican Governors Association, and the Governors' Ethanol Coalition.
In 1991, Branstad ignored binding arbitration with employees of the State of Iowa's labor unions by vetoing a salary bill, was taken to court, and lost later in appeals in the state court system (AFSCME Iowa Council 61 et al., v. Branstad). In 1983, he vetoed a bill that would allow a state lottery.

Post-gubernatorial career

Branstad focused most of his efforts on endeavors outside of politics when he left office at the beginning of 1999. He founded Branstad and Associates, LLC and was also a partner in the firm of Kaufman, Pattee, Branstad & Miller, and a financial advisor for Robert W. Baird and Co.
In August 2003, Branstad accepted an offer from Des Moines University
Branstad was appointed by President George W. Bush to chair the President's Commission for Excellence in Special Education.
Branstad serves on the boards of, among others, Conmed Health Management Inc and Living History Farms.

Governor of Iowa (2011–present)

On August 2, 2009, the Des Moines Register reported that Branstad was actively considering running for the Republican nomination for governor. On October 7, 2009, Branstad filed papers to run for governor in the 2010 election.
On June 8, 2010, Branstad won the Republican gubernatorial nomination, but when opposing candidate Bob Vander Plaats conceded, he did not endorse Branstad."The new Vander Plaats question: Will he back Branstad?", blog post by Reid Forgrave, The Des Moines Register, June 8, 2010. Retrieved 2010-06-09.
The Des Moines Tea Party gave Branstad a "no" on their report card on "criteria for acceptance" and said Branstad had "a history of raising taxes, was not a true conservative, and increased the size of government every year he held office, and built a state-owned phone company."
