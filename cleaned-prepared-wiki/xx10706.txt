A "redshirt" is a stock character in fiction who dies soon after being introduced.  The term originates with fans of the Star Trek television series (1966â€“69), from the red shirts worn by Starfleet security personnel who frequently die during episodes.  Redshirt deaths are often used to dramatize the potential peril that the main characters face.

Star Trek

In many episodes of Star Trek, red-uniformed security officers and engineers accompanying the main characters on landing parties quickly die..

Influence

In other media, the term "redshirt" and images of characters wearing red shirts represent characters destined for suffering or death. The South Park episode "City on the Edge of Forever" (1998) appropriates its name from a Star Trek episode, and includes a direct Star Trek reference when one of the kids, wearing a red T-shirt, defies Mrs. Crabtree's instructions to remain on the bus and is immediately torn apart by a big scary monster lurking in the shadows. John Scalzi's Hugo Award-winning novel Redshirts (2012) both spoofs and pays homage to the notion of disposable low-ranking crew members on a Star Trek-style starship. 
The term was used in United States District Judge Otis D. Wright II's May 2013 judgment against Prenda Law.popehat.popehat.pdf
