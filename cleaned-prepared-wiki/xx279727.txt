History

Luminous Power Technologies (P) Limited is a New Delhi based company which was founded on 10 June 1988. By 1991, the first Luminous Inverter got rolled out. Three years later the first uninterrupted power supply device (UPS) by the company was delivered to the market. The next six years were spent in innovation and further improving its offerings. At the turn of the century the first Luminous Inverter* was exported.

Growth

In the meanwhile, Luminous decided to manufacture batteries. As a consequence a plant was set up in 2004. In the same year Luminous entered into an agreement with Eagle Picher Inc. a USA major and a leader in battery technology.  Eagle Picher Inc. is an original equipment supplier to such diverse industries and activities as automotive, space, chemical processing, defense, environmental, medical and nuclear applications. Its heavy-duty customised batteries are working in the most demanding conditions such as space ships and on planet Mars. The company offers a six-sigma process that gives them the worldwide recognition.
Soon after the agreement was signed, technology flowed in from Eagle Picher Inc. and Luminous launched a broadside on the battery market. A full range of advanced batteries for automotive use, Home UPSs, tubular batteries and VRLA (valve regulated lead acid) SMF (sealed maintenance free) batteries were delivered to a market.
A separate agreement for power products was signed in 2006 with Hyundai to provide the end user with another option for power back up solutions based on advanced Korean technology as well as leverage the strong Hyundai brand name.
