The Fatal Frame (a.k.a. Project Zero) survival horror video game franchise features a cast of interconnected characters, both alive and dead. Most of the series' deceased characters appear as ghosts; the common causes for them are failed dark Shinto rituals, which all lead to disastrous events. These spirits include those who died at the time of disaster (e.g. Ryozo Munakata); or those who become cursed, trapped and killed in the same place at a later time (e.g. Junsei Takamine). Some characters, such as Miku Hinasaki and the Amakura twins, have subsequent roles in latter installments of the series.

She came to like the maker of the tutu she bought to use for practise there, and bought clothes from a brand that was in the same keiretsu." Her design in Shinku no Chou, too, follows this, with additions to her back and shoulders to catch the eye.
design was based on the idea that she chose clothes from the same brand as Mio's, but ones that would give her a different silhouette. Since in the game you so often see her from the front, we concentrated on giving her distinguishing features from this angle. The slits were put into the shoulders so that when she moves her arms it looks like the way the wings of a butterfly move. Mayu also always observed the ballet class, doing sitting gymnastics in the corner, watching Mio the whole time.|ref=
