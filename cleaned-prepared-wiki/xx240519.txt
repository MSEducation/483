Rasamny-Younis Motor Company S.A.L. (RYMCO) is a joint stock company that was established in 1957 in Lebanon. RYMCO is one of the leading vehicle retail dealerships in Lebanon where it holds majority market share in the new vehicle retail industry, and commands a considerable portion of the used vehicle market. RYMCO operates a chain of independent showrooms and stores, a bonded warehouse as well as state-of-the-art servicing and maintenance facilities. The company has an automotive dealership arrangement with auto manufacturers in the US, Japan, Europe and China that include the likes of automotive giants Motors (Nissan, Infiniti), GM vehicles (GMC), Renault trucks, Nissan Diesel (UD) and FAW trucks.

Company Background

Originally launched to deal with general merchandising, the Rasamny brothers founded Rasamny Brothers Inc. in the Liberian Republic in 1934. The family owned and operated a large business conglomerate that included representation of brands such as Chrysler, Ford and Honda in the automotive industry in addition to Palmolive, Colgate and other brands.
In 1957, the Rasamny brothers went on to expand their business and opened the first showroom and back-offices under the umbrella of Rasamny Younis Motor Co. (RYMCO) in Beirut and launched their operations as exclusive dealers of Oldsmobile and GMC.
As a strategic move to grow the company, in 1964 RYMCO built up its own showrooms, back-offices and after-sales facility in Chiah and added the Australian brand, Holden, to the company portfolio.
Three years later, RYMCO introduced the first DATSUN to the Lebanese market constituting a major turning point in the company's profile.
Unfortunately, the Lebanese war left the Chiah facilities in complete ruin and forced RYMCO to move from the location to Deir Koubel at first and then to Choueifat, where a showroom and a service facility were set up to cater to customers needs.
In 1985, after the Israeli invasion, RYMCO was once again forced to move. This time the move saw them relocate from Choueifat to Hamra Street and then to Jal El Baher, which was to later become an official RYMCO branch.
After 1991's ceasefire, RYMCO re-launched its operations from Chiah where the showrooms, the after-sales facility and company offices saw a complete restoration.
By 1992, RYMCO proudly participated with Nissan and GMC in the nation's first every Motor Show.
After 41 years of being a privately owned institution, RYMCO went public in 1998 to become the first and the only automotive dealer to be listed on Beirut Stock Exchange list.
The Chiyah showrooms were given full restoration in 2003, where the re-opening took place in the presence of Nissan CEO, Carlos Ghosn and then in 2004, RYMCO went on to launch its Infiniti boutique in the heart of downtown Beirut becoming the first to open a separate facility for Infiniti outside Northern America.
The following year, Abdo Sweidan, the newly appointed managing director of RYMCO, received the 2005 President Award from Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Nissan.
2006 was a record year for RYMCO, as it maintained the No.1 position and achieved growth across the board for the 7th year in a row. 
In 2007, RYMCO achieved a 74% growth over 2006 controlling 21.3% of the Lebanese market, maintaining its number 1 position. 
2008 was another record year. RYMCO became the fastest growing automotive dealer in Lebanon growing its business by 85.7% from 4273 units in 2007 to 7932 units in 2008, historically no other dealer was able to achieve those sales figure in Lebanon.
