The World Chess Championship 2012 was a chess match between the defending world champion Viswanathan Anand of India and Boris Gelfand of Israel, winner of the 2011 Candidates Tournament.
Anand was the defending champion, having gained the title in 2007 and defended it in 2008 (against Vladimir Kramnik) and in 2010 (against Veselin Topalov). Boris Gelfand became the challenger in 2012 after winning the eight-player 2011 Candidates Tournament. Anand's subsequent victory, therefore, was his third consecutive title defence.
The match conditions called for twelve games to be played with classical time control. If a player scored at least 6½ points, he would be declared the winner and the match ended. By the end of the twelve games, however, the match was tied at 6 points each, so four rapid games were played in order to produce a result. Anand won the rapid-game playoff with a win in the second game and draws in the other three games.

Candidates Tournament

The process for selecting the challenger has undergone a number of changes. A major change was announced on 25 November 2008, when it was announced that a two-player Challenger Match would be replaced with an eight-player Candidates Tournament. The change was criticised by a number of players and commentators, as well as by the Association of Chess Professionals. In June 2009, FIDE indicated that the format would be in the form of matches.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/4050-regulations-for-the-candidates-matches-2010
Originally, the intended venue for the candidate matches was Baku, but Levon Aronian announced that he would not play in Azerbaijan and matches involving him were to be held in a different country.
In November 2010, then world No. 2 Magnus Carlsen withdrew from the Candidates' Tournament citing the selection process as not sufficiently modern and fair.

According to FIDE, the loser of the World Chess Championship 2010 (Veselin Topalov) was seeded no. 1 and the rest were seeded according to FIDE rating as of January 2010.fide.pdf FIDE confirmed the matches on 7 February 2011.

Venue

The 2012 FIDE World Chess Championship was held in Moscow, Russia.
The Executive Board gave during its congress in fall 2009 in Halkidiki an option to London, United Kingdom to organise the World Chess Championship for 2012. They had until 15 February 2010 to exercise the option which had to include the offer of a prize fund similar to that for the World Chess Championship 2010 match.
The London Chess Classic organising body "Chess Promotions Limited" confirmed that London were in negotiations to hold the World Chess Championships in 2012.
As a result FIDE opened an application procedure for the hosting of the World Chess Championship match to be played from 10 April 2012 to 31 May 2012. Organisations interested in bidding to host the event had until 31 July 2011, 13:00 GMT to submit their documents including a bid fee.fide.pdf
On 28 June 2011, it was announced that Moscow had submitted a bid to host the 2012 World Chess Championship.
On 13 July, the Tamil Nadu state government announced a bid of Rs 20 crore (Approx. $4.5 million) for the match to be held in Chennai, India. Chennai is the home city of the World Champion Viswanathan Anand.
In an interview with the Russian newspaper "Kommersant", dated 29 July, Boris Gelfand expressed his concern about the offer made by Chennai. Gelfand said the offer from Moscow was the only transparent one, he was not sure of the existence of financial guarantees by the Indian side. The Chennai offer was in Tamil language and he claimed it had not been translated in English. In the past, matches, including those of Kasparov against Ponomaryov and against Kasimdzanov were cancelled due to lack of financial guarantees.
On 2 August, FIDE announced that it received bids from the Russian chess federation (Moscow) and a second one from the All India chess federation (Chennai). Both were well above the minimum required prize fund. FIDE announced they would contact the bidders and players, and declare the winner of the bid by 10 August 2011.
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, FIDE's president, told the Russian newspaper "Sport Express" that the financial offer was not the only criterion. Other factors, including the possibility of the propagation of the "chess in school" programme, and popularisation of chess in a particular region will also be considered. He would also take into account the views of the champion and the challenger.
On 8 August 2011, FIDE announced that the Russian Chess Federation had won the bid and will host the match in Moscow in May 2012. The prize fund will be 2.55 million US dollars. Skolkovo, the Innovation project near Moscow, was named as a possible venue.
On 20 February 2012 an agreement between the Russian Chess Federation and the Tretyakov Gallery was signed to stage there the World Championship Match.

=Game 1, Anand-Gelfand, ½–½=

=Game 2, Gelfand-Anand, ½–½=

Gelfand started his first game with White in the match by playing 1.d4 and the game went on to Slav Defence. The position in the game followed the game played between Kasparov and Gelfand in Linares in 1991 where Gelfand lost, but in this game the challenger opted a different line. Anand played several accurate moves to set up a good position for neutralising White's active pieces. After 19 moves were played Gelfand decided to exchange his knight for a bishop by 20. The game saw no progress on both sides and Gelfand offered a draw. At the press-conference he described the line he chose as "a slight symbolic edge".World Chess Championship tied at 1–1, The Week in Chess, 15 May 2012

=Game 3, Anand-Gelfand, ½–½=

The game opened with a Grünfeld Defence (as in the game 1), but Anand deviated very early by playing 3.f3 instead of 3. Following the opening moves White gained an edge and was pawn up, but Anand ran into time trouble, having to play 7 moves per minute to reach the time control at move 40 and having missed the winning continuation in the double-rook ending.Anand-Gelfand Game 3 the liveliest so far, The Week in Chess, 16 May 2012
At move 20 White chose to capture correctly with 20.Rxd2 after which the continuation 20...fxe4 Bxd4 22.e5 Bb5 gives Black strong counterplay.  In the next moves the game continued with 20...Rxd2 Rf5 22.d6 (see diagram) and then 23 ... At the press-conference Gelfand said: "I understood the position was dangerous. I underestimated a few moves. I thought that 23...Rd1 and here I had to fight for the draw. I was quite on edge for some time during the game." The game was drawn after 37 moves, as White could not find a line to play for a win. After the game Anand concisely said: "I came closer today."

=Game 5, Anand-Gelfand, ½–½=

Anand started the game by switching the opening move to 1.e4 perhaps to sharpen the play, but Gelfand continued with Sicilian Sveshnikov instead of Sicilian Najdorf or Petroff Defence and the position arriving left the World Champion unprepared. The game reached a standard position after the theoretical moves in the opening, with a bind in the centre for White and a backward d6 pawn and weak d6 square for Black that is compensated with his activity. In the next moves Gelfand successfully equalised the position and left his opponent with minor chances. The game ended in a draw after 27 moves were played.Anand-Gelfand World Championship Game 5 another draw, The Week in Chess, 19 May 2012

=Game 7, Gelfand-Anand, 1–0=

Gelfand scored the first win of the match. Commentators considered 23...g5? to be the critical mistake, allowing Gelfand to get a winning position with 24 Qc7 Qxc7 25 Rxc7. Anand sacrificed his bishop for counterplay but it was not enough. In the final position, black can queen his pawn but cannot stop the threat of Ng6+ followed by Rg7 mate.World Championship G7 – Gelfand draws first blood and leads, Chessbase, 20 May 2012

=Game 8, Anand-Gelfand, 1–0=

Anand started the game with the same play as in the third game, but Gelfand early deviated by playing 3 ...c5 instead of 3 ...d5, which was seen in the game 3. The game was followed with 4.d5 d6 5.e4 Bg7 6.Nec3 Nh5. Gelfand tried to provoke g4 by playing 7 ... But after few moves the Black bishop occupied the f5 square and let White the opportunity to play 12.g4 with a fork on the Black's bishop and knight. The game continued with 12 ...Kd1 Bxb1 14.Sergey Shipov's commentary on Anand-Gelfand, Game 8, Sergei Shipov, 22 May 2012 Gelfand made a serious error on move 14, overlooking Anand's 17 Qf2, which trapped Gelfand's queen. This idea was also missed by grandmaster commentators Peter Leko and Ian Nepomniachtchi, who preferred Black's position until Anand played 17 Qf2...

=Game 9, Gelfand-Anand, ½–½=

For the first time in the match Nimzo-Indian Defence was played. Gelfand obtained a slight edge in the opening by having a position with a bishop pair and hanging central pawns against two knights and a healthy pawn structure on the opposite side. Gelfand chose a concrete line in the middlegame that was criticized by several Grandmasters and exchanged a rook, bishop and pawn for the Anand's queen. However, Anand found a way to make a fortress and defended the game that was drawn after 49 moves as the longest game since the start of the match.Gelfand-Anand G9, a Nimzo-Indian, drawn after 49 moves (VIDEO), ChessVibes, 23 May 2012
Black played 15 ... In the following moves White got a better position with a bishop pair and a mobile center. But, Black played 18 ...c5?!. The move was criticised in the press room and moves like 19.a3, proposed by Smirin or 19.h3, proposed by Grischuk and Shipov were probably better. The game entered an endgame with a queen for White and a rook, knight and a pawn for black. White was trying to play on the a7 pawn and to attack on the kingside, but Black appeared to have found the right evaluation in the end. He played 40 ...

=Game 11, Gelfand-Anand, ½–½=

The game started in a Nimzo-Indian Defence as in the game 9. First surprise of the game was at move 8, when Anand played 8 ... The instigator of this move was David Bronstein, but it was popular and played mostly during the middle of the 20th century.Sergey Shipov's commentary on Anand-Gelfand, Game 11, Sergei Shipov, 27 May 2012
At move 17 (see diagram), Gelfand decided not to take a risk by playing 17.Nd2 followed with 17 ...e5! and some complications. The position that arrived after the exchange of queens was slightly better for White, but with a huge safety for Black. Both players agreed to a draw after 24 moves were played.

Tiebreak

Anand retained the world title by defeating Gelfand in the rapid round. He was able to put time pressure on Gelfand in all four games. In the second game with white, Anand played his moves so fast that Gelfand was forced to make moves with very few seconds to spare.
