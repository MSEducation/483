The International MaxxPro MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) vehicle is an armored fighting vehicle designed by American company Navistar International's subsidiary Navistar Defense along with the Israeli Plasan Sasa, who designed and manufactures the vehicle's armor.$200M+ to Plasan to Armor MaxxPro MRAPs - Defense Industry Daily The vehicle was designed to take part in the US Military's Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle program, led by the US Marine Corps, as well as a similar US Army-led Medium Mine Protected Vehicle program.More MRAPs: Navistar's MaxxPro Maintains the Pole Position
MRAPs are categorized as category 1 or category 2, depending on usage and passenger compartment space, and Navistar produces the MaxxPro in both sizes, although the vast majority of those sold have been category 1 MRAPs. The MaxxPro Plus model comes with dual rear wheels for increased load carrying capacity, such as an ambulance or EFP protected variant. The latest model produced is the MaxxPro Dash, which is a smaller and lighter category 1 model. Both the Plus and Dash models use the MaxxForce 10 engine with 375 hp, in place of the DT 530 with 330 hp, used in the original base model produced.

Design

The MaxxPro utilizes a crew capsule with a V-shaped hull, mounted on an International WorkStar 7000 chassis. The V-hull deflects the blast of a land mine or improvised explosive device (IED) away from the vehicle to protect its occupants. Because the chassis is mounted outside the armored crew capsule, there are concerns that it will likely be destroyed in the event of an ambush, leaving the soldiers inside stranded. However, according to Navistar Defense spokesperson Roy Wiley, the MaxxPro "did extremely well during the tests, and we are extremely pleased." This design may prove as effective as the Krauss-Maffei Wegmann ATF Dingo that uses a similar design, one which mounts an armored capsule to a Unimog chassis. This design has survived a 7 kg (15 lb) land mine blast with no injuries.Krauss-Maffei Wegmann – Ihr Partner rund um Wehrtechnik
According to Navistar Defense, the vehicle is designed with operational readiness in mind and utilizes standardized, easily available parts, to ensure rapid repair and maintenance. This facilitates repair in the field and is a contributing factor to Navistar's greater production capacity for the MaxxPro.Navistar wins $414M contract for 755 MRAPs - Army News, opinions, editorials, news from Iraq, photos, reports - Army Times

AMPV

Navistar is considering modifying the MaxxPro to fit Army requirements for the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle program to replace the M113 family of vehicles.  The vehicle would need to perform the five roles the AMPV would have to fill.  Other contenders believe the Army wants a tracked vehicle, shown by the creation of the Tracked Stryker.  Navistar feels their wheeled MRAP can meet the solutions required.  Although it has less capabilities like gap crossing, it could be capable enough and be cheaper to select with vehicles already in the inventory. Navistar is offering the MaxxPro as a stop-gap solution to replace the M113 quickly with the more survivable MRAP to be used until the AMPV can be fielded in 2020.com, 29 March 2014

On July 18, 2011 Navistar Defense received a delivery order for an additional 140 MRV's with rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) nets from the U.S. Marine Corps Systems Command.

MCOTM

At Association of the United States Army 2013, a version called the Mission Command on the Move (MCOTM) was displayed as a command post with monitors, computers, and antennae mounted in the back for communications and surveillance.  Five passengers can monitor incoming information, see unmanned aerial vehicle feeds, and keep track of where units are operating.  The vehicle has an on-board transmission-integrated power generator that can produce up to 120 kilowatts of exportable power, which eliminates the need for a towed trailer and can single-handedly power a semi-permanent tactical operations center.  It would allow commanders to be connected to dismounted troops and headquarters while on the move.  The MCOTM version will undergo testing at the Army's network integration evaluations in February 2014.
