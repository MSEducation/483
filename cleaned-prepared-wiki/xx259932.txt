Nitish Roenik Kumar (born 21 May 1994) is a cricketer who plays for Canada. He bats right-handed and bowls right-arm off spin. After representing the country at the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in January, Kumar made his One Day International debut the following month, becoming the second-youngest player in the history of ODIs.

Career

On 14 August 2009 Nitish Kumar played in his maiden first-class match, debuting in the same match as teammate Jimmy Hansra. The match was part of the 2009–10 ICC Intercontinental Cup, and in the first innings against Kenya, Kumar made 12 runs before he was dismissed while in the second innings was out first ball.
Canada qualified for the 2011 World Cup held between February and April in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka. The 15-man squad included five players under the age of 21 (including Kumar), all of whom had played in the Under-19 World Cup the previous year. Canada's first match of the 2011–13 ICC Intercontinental Cup took place in August 2011.
The World Twenty20 Qualifier was held in March 2012. During Canada's opening match against the Netherlands Kumar was one of thirteen plays to make their debut in Twenty20 Internationals. He was run out for a single.
The 2013 matches of the 2011–13 ICC Intercontinental Cup offered Kumar further first-class experience, and he bettered his highest score in two consecutive matches. The first, against Kenya in March, saw Kumar score 89 which was the largest contribution to his team's score in the first innings, though Kenya went on to win the match.
