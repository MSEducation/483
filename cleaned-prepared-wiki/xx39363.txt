EastEnders

When the soap began in 1985, the producers said they would only cast unknown actors. The Shoreditch-born Windsor said that she regretted this, as she'd liked to have taken part. What a Carry On: The Official Story of the Carry On Film series, Hamlyn, 1988. ISBN 0-600-55819-3 p. 43

A debilitating case of the Epstein-Barr virus forced a two-year absence from the role between 2003 to 2005., although Windsor was able to make a two episode appearance in 2004. She rejoined the cast in mid-2005, initially on a one-year contract, though this was later extended.

It featured Windsor as Peggy in the Queen Victoria Public House, being tormented by Catherine Tate's schoolgirl character Lauren Cooper.
In October 2009 Windsor announced she was to quit her role as Peggy Mitchell, saying she wanted to spend more time with her husband.
In July 2013, it was announced that Windsor was to return for one episode, which aired on 20 September 2013. There were later rumours that Windsor would return to EastEnders in 2014, but she later declared that Ladies of Song was enough of a career right now, as she is aged 76.
