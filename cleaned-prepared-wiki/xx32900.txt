[[List of IBM products]]

CATEGORIES: IBM products, Computing-related lists, Products by company

The following is a list of products, some notable, some less so, from the International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation and its predecessor corporations, beginning in the 1890s, and spanning punched card equipment, time clocks, and typewriters, via mainframe computers and minicomputers, to microprocessors, software, and more.
This list is eclectic; it includes, for example, the AN/FSQ-7, which was not a product in the sense of offered for sale, but was a product in the sense of manufactured - produced by the labor of IBM.  Several machines manufactured for the Astronomical Computing Bureau at Columbia University are included, as are some machines built only as demonstrations of IBM technology.  Missing are RPQs, OEM products (semiconductors, for example), supplies (punched cards, for example). That products are missing is not by fiat, but simply because no one has added them.
IBM sometimes uses the same number for a system and for the principal component of that system. For example, the IBM 604 Calculating Unit is a component of the IBM 604 Calculating Punch.
IBM also uses two different naming structures for its modern hardware products.  Products are normally given a 3 or 4 digit machine type and a model number (can be a mix of letters and numbers).  A product may also have a marketing or brand name.  For instance, 2107 is the machine type for the IBM System Storage DS8000.  While the majority of products are listed here by machine type, there are instances where only a marketing or brand name is used.  Care should be taken when searching for a particular product as sometimes the type and model numbers overlap.  For instance the IBM storage product known as the Enterprise Storage Server is machine type 2105, and the IBM printing product known as the IBM Infoprint 2105 is machine type 2705, so searching for an IBM 2105 could result in two different products - or the wrong product - being found.
IBM introduced the 80-column rectangular hole punched card in 1928.  Pre-1928 machine models that continued in production with the new 80-column card format had the same model number as before.  Machines manufactured prior to 1928 were, in some cases, retrofitted with 80-column card readers and/or punches thus there exist machines with pre-1928 dates of manufacture that contain 1928 technology.
This list is organized by classifications of both machines and applications, rather than by product name.  Thus some (few) entries will be duplicated.  The 1420, for example, is listed both as a member of the 1401 family and as a machine for Bank and finance.
IBM product names have varied over the years; for example these two texts both reference the same product.
This article uses the name, or combination of names, most descriptive of the product. Product numbers include leading zeros; 080 not 80 for example.  Thus the entry for the above is

"It was collected over a period of several years from the alt.computers USENET group. I started out with the ones I knew, and slowly people contributed more items, until we have what you see. I could not point you to a single - or even a few - lists with attributions; it was a community effort." – Lars Poulsen That list is here[/ref]

Calculators

Time Equipment Division

IBM manufactured a surprising(!) range of clocks and other devices until 1958 when they sold the Time Equipment Division.  See:

Typewriters and dictating equipment

Copier/Duplicators

The IBM line of Copier/Duplicators, and their associated service contracts, were sold to Eastman Kodak in 1988.

Computers based on vacuum tubes (1950s)

For these computers most components were unique to a specific computer and are shown here immediately following the computer entry.

In IBM's terminology beginning with the System/360 disk and such devices featuring short access times were collectively called DASD.  The IBM 2321 Data Cell is a DASD that used tape as its storage medium. See also History of IBM magnetic disk drives.
