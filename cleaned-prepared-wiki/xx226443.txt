Service history

Royal Air Force

After joining the RAF he was promoted to Flight Lieutenant and his first posting was as a QFI at No. 1 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School, Hatfield where he remained until May 1941. He was sent on a course at No. 54 Operational Training Unit before receiving a combat posting as a fighter pilot with No. 219 Squadron RAF. In July 1941 he was promoted again to Acting Squadron Leader and appointed as  flight commander of 'B' flight.
In September 1942 his rank of Squadron Leader having been made substantive he was promoted to Acting Wing Commander and posted to RAF West Malling as Officer Commanding No. 29 Squadron RAF flying Bristol Beaufighters. Between December 1942 and January 1943 he took the additional temporary role of Station Commander at West Malling.
In February 1943, he was reverted to Squadron Leader (War Substantive) before he was posted in  to No. 81 Group RAF as a headquarters staff officer. In July that year Wight-Boycott returned to operational flying as an Acting Wing Commander and Officer Commanding No. 9 Group RAF. In the September he was appointed Officer Commanding No. 25 Squadron RAF flying de Havilland Mosquitos. Wight-Boycott finished the air war with a score of seven aircraft destroyed, two damaged and two V-1 flying bombs shot down and destroyed. 
In September 1944 Wight-Boycott was posted as a Headquarters Staff Officer with No. 12 Group RAF but only a few months later moved to an appointment as Station Commander of RAF Church Fenton. In early 1945 he moved, again as Station Commander, to RAF Molesworth home of the USAF 303rd Bombardment Group and remained there until September when he attended a ''Methods of Instruction'' course at the RAF Senior Staff College.
Following his course he became an instructor at the RAF's Officers' Advanced Training School.

In July 1947 he was promoted to Wing Commander with seniority and pay backdated to October 1946. In February 1948 he was posted as the Air Staff Officer at Headquarters, RAF Middle East.

On 13 January 1958 he was appointed the RAF's Director of Operational Requirements (A), moving sideways as Director of Organisation/Logistics (Forecasting and Planning) in September that year.

Royal Observer Corps

On 1 July 1958 Wight-Boycott received his final promotion to Air Commodore and was appointed as the tenth Commandant of the Royal Observer Corps, taking over from Air Commodore J M Warfield. He had taken over the ROC at a crucial time in its development, as the building programme of 1,500 underground monitoring posts and 31 operational group controls, to provide protected accommodation during nuclear warfare, had just started all over the UK. As Commandant, Wight-Boycott found himself travelling the country to perform endless opening ceremonies as each new Group Control bunker was commissioned and declared operational.
In the course of the massive consolidation of the organisation nine previous ROC groups were disestablished and closed. Some spare time observers were able to transfer to nearby groups but many others, together with the groups' civilian staffs, found that their services were no longer required and they were stood down. The professional wholetime officers from the closed group headquarters were declared supernumerary, redesignated as Mobile Training Officers and spent the next few years moving from group to group covering holiday and illness absences by other officers. The arrangement continued until natural wastage had reduced the cadre back to the new manning levels.
In July 1961 Wight-Boycott presented a Royal Observer Corps long-service medal to the Battle of Britain Class locomotive Royal Observer Corps that had started its service with the Great Western Railway company in December 1948. The ceremony took place at Waterloo Station. Following the engine's break up its original nameplate and front badge were recovered and displayed in the entrance hall of Headquarters ROC at RAF Bentley Priory, until 1996 when it was transferred to the RAF Museum.
On 3 June 1964 Air Commodore Wight-Boycott retired from the RAF and handed over command of the Corps to Air Commodore J H Greswell.
