The Minnesota Orchestra is an American orchestra based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Osmo Vänskä is the most recent music director, serving in that role from the 2003–04 season to 1 October 2013.
The orchestra's musicians were recently locked out of their jobs for 16 months by the orchestra's governing body, the Minnesota Orchestral Association, after failing to reach a new collective bargaining agreement. The lockout began on October 1, 2012 with two months of concerts canceled. In the months that followed the entire 2012–13 concert season was canceled. One year after the lockout began, on October 1, 2013, Vänskä resigned. Subsequent statements and actions by Vänskä (who conducted three sold-out concerts with the locked-out musicians days after his resignation) made it clear that he sided with the musicians in the bitter dispute.  On January 14, 2014, the MOA and the musicians of the orchestra approved a new three-year contract, which ended the lockout on February 1, 2014.  Minnesota Orchestra labor dispute settled.

History

Emil Oberhoffer founded the orchestra as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra in 1903, and it gave its first performance on November 5 of that year. In 1968, the orchestra changed its name to the Minnesota Orchestra. It makes its home in downtown Minneapolis at Orchestra Hall, which was built for the ensemble in 1974. The orchestra's previous hall, starting in 1929, was Northrop Memorial Auditorium on the University of Minnesota's Minneapolis campus.

Recordings

The orchestra first began recording in 1924, and produced some landmark records. Among these was the first electrical recording of Mahler's Resurrection Symphony with Eugene Ormandy, who recorded extensively with the orchestra for RCA Victor in the 1930s. In the 1940s, the Minneapolis Symphony was contracted to Columbia Records and made a series of records with Ormandy's successor, Dimitri Mitropoulos. These included the premiere recording of Mahler's First Symphony. In 1954, they also made the first recording of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture to include actual cannon fire, again under Doráti's direction. These recordings were made for Mercury Records as part of the Living Presence series. In the 1970s, the renamed Minnesota Orchestra made a series of recordings for Vox Records under the direction of Stanisław Skrowaczewski. In the 1990s, the orchestra recorded for the Reference Recordings label under the direction of music director Eiji Oue. More recently Osmo Vänskä has conducted a cycle of the Beethoven symphonies and begun a cycle of the Sibelius symphonies, both for the Swedish label BIS. Their recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, with the Minnesota Chorale, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance in 2007,

Summer festival

Begun in 1980 with Leonard Slatkin at the helm, the orchestra's summer festival has been known by several names, beginning with "Viennese Sommerfest," changing to "MusicFest" in 2001, and eventually reverting to "Sommerfest" in 2003. Sommerfest concerts are held at Orchestra Hall over a four-week period in midsummer. The orchestra also offers free live music on the plaza before and after each show, in genres varying from folk to jazz to polka. Slatkin was Music Director of Sommerfest from 1980 to 1989. Since 2003, Andrew Litton has been Music Director, and in June 2008, his contract in this post was extended to 2011.  Pioneer Press, 30 June 2008.

Financial concerns

Since 2007, the Minnesota Orchestra has suffered from a dwindling endowment, exacerbated by the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and diminished revenues. In August 2008, the Minnesota Orchestra Association's invested assets totaled $168.5 million, 13% less than the $192.4 million the Association had projected in its 2007 Strategic Plan Summary.minnesotaorchestra.7 million in securities at a nearly $14 million loss".
During 2009 and 2010, the orchestra's board reported a balanced budget and drew on its endowment to cover operational deficits. At the time, it was trying to secure $16 million in state bonding for renovations of Orchestra Hall and Peavey Plaza.

2012–2014 lockout

On October 1, 2012, the Minnesota Orchestral Association (the orchestra's governing body) locked out the orchestra's musicians and canceled concerts through November 18 after failing to reach a new collective bargaining agreement. The MOA stated that spending on musician salaries and benefits was depleting the organization's endowment, and that labor costs needed to be reduced by $5 million per year. The musicians and their union took the position that the proposed cuts were so deep and draconian as to represent an existential threat to the future of the orchestra. 
The entire 2012–13 concert season was canceled.  He acted on this threat on October 1, 2013, by resigning with immediate effect.Kerr, Euan, Conductor Vanska resigns from Minnesota Orchestra, Minnesota Public Radio (October 1, 2013)
On October 4 and 5, Vänskä conducted three final concerts with the locked-out orchestra at the University of Minnesota's Ted Mann Concert Hall; Emanuel Ax took the solo part in piano concertos by Mozart and Beethoven, and the program ended with Stravinsky's Firebird Suite. As an encore, Vänskä conducted Sibelius's Valse Triste, which he described as a dance of death. At his request, the audience withheld applause afterward; many reportedly left in tears.
On January 14, 2014, the Musicians of the Minnesota Orchestra announced that they had reached a collective bargaining agreement with the Minnesota Orchestra Association to end the lockout on February 1, 2014. Concerts resumed at Orchestra Hall in February. On April 24, 2014, it was announced that Osmo Vänskä would return to his post as musical director for the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons.minnesotaorchestra.org/about/learn-more/press-room/908-vanska-to-return
