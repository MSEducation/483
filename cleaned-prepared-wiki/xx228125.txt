The Kansas City Missouri Temple is the 137th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).  It is the first to be built in the Greater Kansas City area.  Previous attempts at building an LDS temple in the area failed in Independence in 1833 and Far West in 1838, after LDS founder Joseph Smith had selected and dedicated locations for their construction. A temple was completed in Independence in 1994 by the Community of Christ church, which is not affiliated with the LDS Church and does not serve the same theological functions.

Announcement and construction

The announcement of the new temple was made on October 4, 2008 during the church's 178th Semiannual general conference by LDS Church president Thomas S. Monson. When the announcement was made, Monson did not specify whether the temple would be constructed in Kansas or Missouri. This was the second temple built in Missouri, after the St. Louis Missouri Temple.  
The Kansas City Missouri Temple was announced concurrently with the Philadelphia Pennsylvania, Calgary Alberta, CÃ³rdoba Argentina and Rome Italy temples.
On October 22, 2009, the Kansas City Council approved The Meadows at Searcy Creek First Plat, the subdivision of the Shoal Creek development where the temple is located.  The plat includes the lot for a church meetinghouse as well as the temple.

Open house and dedication

The temple was opened to the public for an open house between April 7, 2012 - April 28, 2012.
Over 92,000 people toured the temple. 47 states and 11 countries were represented at the open house.
On May 5, 2012, church members between the ages of 12-18 who reside in the new temple district staged a cultural performance at the Kansas City Municipal Auditorium in celebration of the completion of the temple.  The following day, May 6, 2012, the temple was dedicated by Thomas S. Monson.
