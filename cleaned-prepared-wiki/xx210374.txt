InterProse holds several trademarks and is currently seeking a patent for its Ammina Virtual Agent  technology. This technology merges human and machine elements into an intelligent pseudo-agent.

History

In the late 1990s, InterProse became the dominant vendor in low cost desktop PC-based data conversion software. This became a catalyst for many small companies to enable them to compete with must larger companies because the cost barriers for data interface had been erased. The resultant influx of new business opportunities for InterProse's clients created a need for more sophisticated and complex interface work. This drove the expansion of InterProses's Professional Services group.
In 1999 InterProse decided to merge with the then Mt. Hood Media, a company that specialized in website development and web-based applications, to expand its offering into the newly emerging eCommerce  space. By 2001 InterProse had developed version 1.0 of WebAR a web-based SaaS application to provide client access to companies assigning accounts to collection agencies for the purpose of account tracking and performance audits.
In 2003 InterProse released version 2.0 of WebAR with addition support for the processing of electronic payments, A/R management, and debt collection.
In 2007 InterProse released its virtual agent product, now known as Ammina, which combined a non threatening avatar and advanced expert system decisioning engine to allow a customer/patient/subscriber/debtor to manage their accounts without the necessity of speaking to a human thus providing benefit to both creditor and customer (see whitepaper).
