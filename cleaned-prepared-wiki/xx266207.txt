PMID 6348651. and the development of new research methodology to evaluate complementary techniques, Lewith has also co-authored several studies indicating a lack of specific efficacy in some complementary therapies and techniques. "Can a standardized acupuncture technique palliate disabling breathlessness: a single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study". Chest 125 (5): 1783-1790. doi:10.1378/chest.125.5.1783.

Broadcasting, advocacy and controversy

Lewith was a council member
In 1997, Lewith presented a documentary series examining complementary medicine for Channel 4 called Natural Born Healers.
In 2004 he participated in a radio series presented by Anna Ford about complementary medicine co-produced by BBC Radio 4 and the Open University,  titled The Other Medicine.
A 2006 BBC documentary series, Alternative Medicine, was criticised by several people, including Lewith, in the Guardian over a controversial sequence in which acupuncture appeared to be used as a replacement for general anaesthesia during open heart surgery. Lewith had participated in the series as an advisor, but criticised the programme for inappropriate sensationalism and poor interpretation of science.
In criticisms published in the British Medical Journal, both Jane Cassidy and David Colquhoun criticise Lewith, claiming that he prescribes homoeopathy despite having written papers that conclude it doesn't work.  and other research suggesting that, while the homeopathic medicine itself does not appear to have an effect, the homeopathic consultation has a clinically relevant non-specific effect.
