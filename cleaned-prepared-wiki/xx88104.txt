Jason Benedict Lee (born 9 May 1971) is an English former footballer and manager.
Lee plays as a forward and has previously played in the Premier League for Nottingham Forest. He also played for Charlton Athletic, Stockport County, Lincoln City, Southend United, Grimsby Town, Watford, Chesterfield, Peterborough United, Falkirk, Boston United, Northampton Town, Notts County, Mansfield Town, Kettering Town, Corby Town, Ilkeston Town and Arnold Town. In 2011 he returned to Boston United as player/mananger but was dismissed in December 2012.

Playing career

Lee began his career at Charlton Athletic but having failed to establish himself in the side moved to Lincoln City in 1991 before later moving to Southend United.
He moved to Nottingham Forest in 1994, earning the nickname "Pineapple Head" due to his distinctive tied up dreadlock haircut. Initially, Lee failed to crack his way into Forest's first team. However the departure of Stan Collymore to Liverpool saw him feature for the first team. In the 1995–96 season he scored eight league goals in 28 games.
Following two loan spells, back at his first club Charlton and at Grimsby Town, Lee was transferred to Watford in 1997 for £200,000 – the same fee paid by Forest three years earlier – and played in their 1997–98 Second Division championship-winning side, scoring ten goals. However, Lee's refusal to uproot his family from Nottingham caused tension with manager Graham Taylor, who sold him to Chesterfield early in the 1998–99 season for £250,000.
Since then, he has played for Peterborough (2000–2003), Falkirk (2003–2004), Boston (2004–2006). In January 2006, Lee joined Northampton Town on a free transfer. He was part of the Northampton side that won promotion from League Two, appearing 11 times for the Cobblers and scoring one goal against Notts County. However he was released at the end of the season and subsequently joined Aldershot. His stay at the Shots was a brief one, and in June 2006 he moved to Notts County, and was team captain for the 2007–08 season.
Following his release from the Magpies, signed for Mansfield Town on 1 August 2008.
Lee signed for Kettering Town on 13 Janunary 2009, for the remainder of the 2008–09 season from Mansfield Town. Lee scored once in six league games for Kettering, his strike coming in a 2–1 loss to Stevenage on 27 January 2009.
He moved on to Corby Town, making his début in a 3–3 draw against Farnborough on 21 March 2009.
He joined Ilkeston Town of the Conference North on 1 April 2010, scoring on his début in a 2–1 victory over AFC Telford United.[ref]

After a long and wide ranging career Lee announced his retirement from football in November 2010 following the death of his mother.
Lee came out of retirement in March 2011 when he joined Arnold Town, debuting in the club's Northern Counties East League 1–0 defeat at Hallam on 8 March 2011. The same week he was announced as the Matchday VIP Host for former club Lincoln City, a role which would limit his availability for Arnold. His second, and final, league appearance for the club saw him sent-off for two yellow cards, the second for the use of the elbow, in the 4–2 defeat to Pickering Town on 19 March 2011.

Management career

On 22 March 2011, Lee, along with Lee Canoville was confirmed as caretaker coach of Boston United following the resignation of joint first team managers Rob Scott and Paul Hurst. Lee re-registered himself as a player towards the end of the 10–11 season. He made three appearances, including the final of the Lincolnshire Senior Shield and one Conference North playoff-game. Jason Lee was sacked as manager in December 2012 after a run of poor results in the 2012/13 season leaving the Pilgrims in 10th place."Jason Lee sacked as Boston United manager" – BBC Sport,

Personal life

Despite moderate success, Lee's fame did not derive so much from his talent as the decision of Frank Skinner and David Baddiel to lampoon him, obsessively taking shots at his "pineapple" haircut on their laddish football chat show Fantasy Football League. Following repeated ridicule on the programme, Lee suffered a torrent of chants and abuse from the terraces, including the chant "He's got a pineapple, on his head, he's got a pineapple, on his head!" (to the tune of He's Got the Whole World in His Hands by Laurie London) made famous by Skinner and Baddiel.
The show also mocked his apparent inability to score and Lee claimed the constant jokes undermined his confidence. Soon after he shaved off his hair.
Lee caused upset amongst sections of the Chesterfield supporters when appearing on Sky Sports' Soccer AM program on 30 March 2013."Jason lee on Soccer AM", 30 March 2013
