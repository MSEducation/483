Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport  is a city owned, public airport five miles north of Lubbock, in Lubbock County, Texas, United States. Originally Lubbock International Airport, it was renamed in 2004 for former Texas governor Preston E. Smith, an alumnus of Texas Tech University.
It is in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which called it a primary commercial service airport. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 562,241 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 534,818 in 2009 and 508,858 in 2010.
The airport is the 8th busiest airport in Texas. Lubbock International is first among the smaller Texas cities (behind only both Dallas airports, both Houston airports, San Antonio, Austin and El Paso). Wait times at this airport are minimal, about ten minutes from entering the airport to ticket-counters to gate. It is one of 42 airports around the world with CNN Airport Network. Lubbock Preston Airport is a hub for Fedex's and UPS's feeder planes to cities around the South Plains.

History

The airport opened in November 1937 as South Plains Airport. In 1942 the United States Army Air Forces indicated a need for the airport as a training airfield. After its requisition by the Air Force, it was assigned to the World War II Army Air Forces Flying Training Command, Gulf Coast Training Center (later Central Flying Training Command).  The airport was renamed South Plains Army Airfield and a rapid period of construction was begun to convert the civil airport into a military training airfield.
Construction involved runways and airplane hangars, with three concrete runways, several taxiways and a large apron and a control tower. Several large hangars were also built. Buildings were utilitarian and quickly assembled. Most base buildings, not meant for long-term use, were of temporary or semi-permanent materials. Some hangars had steel frames and the occasional brick or tile brick building could be seen, but most support buildings had concrete foundations and frame construction clad in little more than plywood and tarpaper.
The base was activated on 11 September 1942 as the South Plains Flying School. The mission was ground and flying training of glider pilots. Glider training was performed by the 848th School Squadron (Special), with overall training being under the 64th Two-Engine Flying Training Group.  Aircraft assigned were Douglas C-47 Skytrains and Waco CG-4A gliders. The CG-4A was the USAAF's primary glider, consisting of little more than a wooden and fabric shell, equipped with radio, wheels, and brakes. Glider pilots trained at South Plains flew these craft in combat during the Normandy Invasion, Operation Market-Garden, and also Operation Varsity, the airborne invasion of Germany.
By late 1944 Flying Training Command ended all glider instruction, and control of South Plains AAF was transferred to Air Service Command at Tinker Field, Oklahoma. Under Air Service Command, South Plains became a maintenance and supply depot for excess aircraft that could not be accommodated at Tinker. After the war ended, in 1946 and 1947, South Plains was used as a storage facility for excess aircraft prior to their reclamation.
Military use of South Plains ended on December 1, 1947 and the facility was returned to the local government for civil use.
