The  is an electric multiple unit (EMU) train type used for commuter and outer-suburban services operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) in Japan since 2000.

Design

Trains were manufactured by Tokyu Car Corporation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and also at JR East's factory at Niitsu in Niigata Prefecture.

Variants

The type evolved from the earlier 209 series and E217 series EMUs, with the main visible difference being wider bodies (2,950 mm compared to the 2,800 mm for earlier commuter trains), and the prototype train built in 1998 for trials on the Chūō-Sōbu Line was actually classified 209-950 series, later becoming E231-900 series. Full-production E231-0 series trains were subsequently introduced on the Chūō-Sōbu Line (10-car sets) and Jōban Line (10+5-car sets). Other variants include the 11-car E231-500 series for the Yamanote Line, and the E231-800 series with 2,800 mm wide bodies and end doors for use on Tokyo Metro Tōzai Line interrunning services.
From 2000 onward, the first E231-1000 series outer-suburban variant was delivered for use on Utsunomiya Line and Takasaki Line services north from Ueno Station in Tokyo. These trains included transverse seating in some cars and were also equipped with toilets. Production continued into 2006 with trains delivered for use on the Tōkaidō Main Line south from Tokyo. From 2004 onward, two bilevel Green cars were inserted into all E231-1000 series 10-car sets.

E231-0 series

46 10-car sets (Sets 1-42, 57, 80-82) based at Mitaka Depot for use on Chūō-Sōbu Line services, replacing the earlier 103 and 201 series fleet. Sets 1 to 42 were delivered between February 2000 and November 2001. Set 57 was delivered in November 2002. Sets 80 to 82 were delivered between October and November 2006. The first sets entered service on 13 March 2000. These sets each include one "six-door" SaHa E230 car (car 5).
17 10-car sets (101 to 117) and 19 5-car sets (121 to 139) based at Matsudo Depot for use on Jōban Line services between Ueno and Toride, and also Narita Line services to Narita, replacing the earlier 103 series fleet. The fleet was delivered between November 2001 and February 2005, with the first trains entering service on 3 March 2002.

E231-500 series

A fleet of 52 11-car E231-500 series was delivered from January 2002 to April 2005 for use on Yamanote Line services, replacing the earlier 205 series fleet. The first trains entered service on 21 April 2002. These trains include D-ATC digital automatic train control, and feature pairs of LCD passenger information screens above each door internally. These screens also show  advertisements.
Each 11-car set contains two 6-door SaHa E230 trailer cars (cars 7 and 10) with six pairs of doors per side and bench seats that were folded up until 10 a.m. on weekdays to provide standing room only during the morning peak. From 22 February 2010, the seats were able to be used during the morning peak.
The two 6-door cars in each set were replaced by a new build of 4-door trailer cars between February 2010 and August 2011, to standardize door spacing ahead of the introduction of platform doors on all Yamanote Line stations by 2017. The new cars were built to E233 series standards, and the replacement cars (SaHa E231-4600) for car 10 have an irregular door spacing corresponding to the driving cars of Keihin-Tōhoku Line E233-1000 series sets, which occasionally have to share the same platforms during engineering work. This results in interior seating arranged 3-7-7-5-4, instead of the normal 3-7-7-7-3 arrangement.
