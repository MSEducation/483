[[List of national anthems]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of anthems, Lists of national symbols, Lists of patriotic songs, National anthems, National anthem writers

Most nations have anthems, defined as "a song, as of praise, devotion, or patriotism"; Some states use the royal anthem as the national anthem, such as the anthem of Jordan.
There are multiple claimants to the position of oldest national anthem.
National anthems are usually written in the most common language of the state, whether de facto or official. For example, India's anthem "Jana Gana Mana" is written in a Sanskritized version of Bengali, which are both official languages of India.

Anthems of United Nations member states

Only United Nations member states are included in this table. Anthems of sovereign states which are not UN members are listed in a separate table below. An English translation of the title is provided in parentheses where appropriate.

Anthems of other states and territories

This table includes anthems of de facto sovereign states which are not members of the United Nations. Many of them have received little or no recognition from the international community; some are widely considered to be part of one of the countries listed above.
