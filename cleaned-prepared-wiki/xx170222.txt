History

At the establishment of regional local government in Queensland on 11 November 1879 with the Divisional Boards Act 1879, most of the area was part of the Caboolture Division, while the northernmost part around Noosa was part of the Widgee Division centred on Gympie. The Maroochy Division split away from Caboolture on 5 July 1890. All three divisions became Shires on 31 July 1903 under the Local Authorities Act 1902.
In 1910, the Shire of Noosa split from Widgee, and on 22 February 1912 the Shire of Landsborough split from Caboolture.435. The two new entities together with Maroochy were to remain fairly stable for almost 100 years.
On 19 December 1987, the Shire of Landsborough was granted City status, and was renamed the City of Caloundra,Queensland Government Gazette, 19 December 1987, p.1465. reflecting the population boom in the coastal section of the City.
In July 2007, the Local Government Reform Commission released its report and recommended that the three local governments amalgamate. While it noted all three were "functioning councils with moderate to strong financial performance", it argued that they covered a self-contained region in a geographic, social and economic sense and that the advantages of coordinated planning in a high-growth area and the avoidance of duplication of facilities were arguments in favour of amalgamation. The councils opposed the amalgamation, and the Commission itself noted that the bulk of statewide individual submissions came from this region reflecting a "depth of feeling" regarding the issue. On 15 March 2008, the City and two Shires formally ceased to exist, and elections were held on the same day to elect twelve councillors and a mayor to the Regional Council.
In 2012, a proposal was made to de-amalgamate the Shire of Noosa from the Sunshine Coast Region.

Divisions

The Region is divided into 12 divisions, each represented by one councillor, plus an elected mayor who represents the entire Region. The council is elected for a four-year term.
