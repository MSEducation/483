Commencement speech controversy

An incident at the school's commencement on June 15, 2006 sparked a lawsuit against the school.  The commencement was held at The Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, where 400 graduates and their families were gathered for graduation. The commencement speech of Foothill valedictorian, Brittany McComb (then 18 years old) was cut short after a school employee pulled the plug on the microphone during her speech. A video of the incident shows that the sound system was cut off.
McComb unsuccessfully brought suit against the school in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, citing as defendants the principal, the assistant principal, and the school employee who turned off the sound system on McComb.[ref]
