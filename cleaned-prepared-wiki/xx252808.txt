[[Marbella blast furnaces]]

CATEGORIES: Marbella, Economy of Spain

The Marbella blast furnaces () were the first iron works in Spain.
The blast furnaces in Marbella were built after the discovery of iron ore deposits  in Ojén because of the availability of charcoal in the Sierra Blanca mountain range and the supply of water from the Verde River. In August and September of 1826, two societies called La Concepción and El Angel were established,  the first promoted by Manuel Agustín Heredia, the second by Joan Giró.
The furnaces at one time accounted for 75 per cent of the iron smelted in Spain, but iron produced in charcoal-fired kilns was much more expensive than that obtained by using coke as fuel; consequently the steel industry in Marbella died out due to competition from the more efficient steel producers of the north.

History

In 1828 Málaga businessman Manuel Heredia founded a company called La Concepción all of which accounted for Marbella's high unemployment, increase in poverty, and the starvation of many day laborers.
The associated infrastructure built for the installation of the foundry of El Angel in 1871 by the British-owned Marbella Iron Ore Company
