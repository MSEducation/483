CATEGORIES: West Indian cricket captains, Lists of West Indies cricketers, Lists of cricket captains, West Indies in international cricket

This is a list of all men, boys and women who have captained the West Indian cricket team at official international level in at least one match. The West Indies became a full member of the Imperial Cricket Conference (now the International Cricket Council) on 31 May 1926 at the same time as India and New Zealand were made up to full membership and played its first Test match in 1928 against England at Lord's. Their first game against other opposition came in 1930/31 when they played Australia.
The West Indian team's greatest successes in One Day Internationals came in 1975 and 1979, when they won the Cricket World Cup under the captaincy of Clive Lloyd, and in 2004 when they won the ICC Champions Trophy under the captaincy of Brian Lara. The West Indies' most successful captains in Test cricket are Viv Richards (who has won 27 of his 50 Tests), Clive Lloyd (who won 36 of his 74 Tests), Frank Worrell (who won 9 of his 15 Tests) and Richie Richardson (who won 11 of his 24 Tests). In one-day internationals the West Indies' most successful captain is Clive Lloyd, who won 64 of his 84 matches. For the most recent international format of cricket, Twenty20 Internationals, the West Indies' best result in an international tournament was achieved in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 where the team won the ICC World Twenty20 under the captaincy of Darren Sammy. Merissa Aguilleira led West Indies women to the semi-finals in the 2010 ICC Women's World Twenty20, the 2012 ICC Women's World Twenty20 and the 2014 ICC Women's World Twenty20 and also led the women to their first title in an international Women's Twenty20 tournament during the 2010 ICC Women's Cricket Challenge. Both the West Indies' men's and women's teams made it to the semi-finals of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and 2012 ICC Women's World Twenty20 under the captaincies of Darren Sammy and Merissa Aguilleira respectively; the third time the men's and women's teams from the same country have done this in the ICC World Twenty20 after Australia's men and women's teams achieved the feat in 2010 and 2012. This feat was repeated for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and 2014 ICC Women's World Twenty20 when the West Indies' men's and women's teams made it to the semi-finals again under the captaincies of Darren Sammy and Merissa Aguillera. Along with South Africa's men and women's teams who also made it the semi-finals in the 2014 tournaments, this was the fifth time men's and women's teams from the same country have reached the semi-finals in the same year of the ICC World Twenty20. Aguilleira also led the West Indies women to its best result in Women's ODI cricket when the team finished second in the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup (bettering their previous best finish in the Women's World Cup of fifth place in 2005). Their previous best result had been under Stephanie Power when she led the West Indies to second place in the 2003 International Women's Cricket Council Trophy. Aguilleira is also the most successful West Indies women's captain in one-day internationals, winning 32 of 55 matches. The only women's captain who has led her side to a victory in a women's Test match is Louise Brown in the 1976/77 Test series against India. In the mid-1980s there were two rebel West Indian tours to South Africa, which was at that time banned from official competition because of the apartheid régime then in force there. None of the matches from the rebel tours were recognised as official Test matches and all players who toured South Africa at the time were banned from official international cricket matches for life. The captains of those West Indian sides are also listed below.
Prior to becoming a member of the ICC, the first combined West Indian team was formed in 1884Canada Cricket online – scroll to "West Indies 1886 tour to Canada" and toured Canada and the United States in 1886 under the captaincies of Charles Guy Austin Wyatt of DemeraraThe Development of West Indies Cricket Google Book results pages 22 and 23 and Laurence Fyfe of JamaicaCanada Cricket online – scroll to "The first West Indies cricket tour" (also vice captain under Wyatt). In a return tour by the United States in 1888, the combined West Indian team was captained by Edward Wright. The West Indies also toured England in 1900, 1906 and 1923 with the opposition usually being various English first-class and minor county sides. Other opposition during these tours included amateur sides, the MCC, an England XI (once) and Scotland and Ireland (once each). Some of the matches played on the various West Indian tours of England were deemed not to be first-class matches. During this time (1897 to 1926) the various West Indies captains were Aucher Warner, Stanley Sproston (non-first-class matches only), Harold Austin, Clement King, Alfred Harrigan, Edwin Moulder, William Sherlock, Percy Tarilton, Malcolm Austin and Karl Nunes

This match was the first tied Twenty20 International and also involved the first bowl-out (won by New Zealand). Two years later in December 2008, another match between New Zealand and West Indies at the same venue in Auckland was also tied and this match involved the first elimination over/Super Over (won by West Indies) which is meant to replace the bowl-out. The first Twenty20 International played in the West Indies was played on 20 June 2008 against Australia in Bridgetown, Barbados.

Other men's captains

In addition to the above official Tests and ODIs, there have been West Indian captains of other leading sides. The Rest of the World teams that played in England and Australia in 1970 and 1971/2 respectively were captained by a West Indian. World Series Cricket featured a West Indian side, and finally, there were two rebel West Indian tours to apartheid South Africa.

=Rest of the World, 1970 and 1971/2=

When the South African tour to England due to take place in 1970 was cancelled, five matches were arranged against a Rest of the World team, all of which were recognised as Tests at the time, although they were later stripped of Test status. A similar situation also arose with the proposed South African tour of Australia that was due to take place in 1971/2, when the Rest of the World team also played two one-day matches. (There were to be three games, but one was abandoned without a ball being bowled.) These matches do not have official ODI status. The Rest of the World team was captained by a West Indian, Garfield Sobers.

=World Series Cricket, 1977/8 to 1978/9=

In 1977/8 Kerry Packer financed a breakaway cricket movement by signing up top players from Australia, the West Indies and other cricket nations around the world. Three sides were constructed: an Australian team, a West Indian team and a World team, with the World teams including some West Indians too. The teams played a mixture of unofficial Test matches, styled as Supertests, and unofficial ODIs. Unlike the Australian players, who were barred from playing official cricket until the rift was healed after the 1978/9 season, the West Indian players were permitted to play official cricket as well as compete in World Series Cricket.

=Rebel tour to South Africa, 1982/3 and 1983/4=

In 1982/3 and 1983/4 a group of West Indian cricketers toured apartheid South Africa. The West Indies Cricket Board banned all the tourists from cricket for life, and such was the furore caused by the visits that many of the cricketers ceased to be welcome in their home islands. The rebel West Indian squad played a series of Tests and ODIs, none of which have official status.
