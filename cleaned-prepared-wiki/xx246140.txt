[[Pulse wave velocity]]

Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a measure of arterial stiffness.

Relationship between arterial stiffness and pulse wave velocity

The study of the basic scientific principles of the velocity of the pulse wave through the arterial tree dates back to 1808 with the work of Thomas Young. The relationship between pulse wave velocity (PWV) and arterial wall stiffness can be calculated from first principles from Newton's second law of motion;
Using some simplifying assumptions, the Moensâ€“Korteweg equation can be derived, an equation that directly relates PWV and artery wall stiffness.

Measuring pulse wave velocity

Using the velocity of the forward traveling wave

This holds true for a system with zero wave reflections.  The transmission of the arterial pressure pulse does not give the true PWV as it is a sum of vectors of the incident and reflected waves.  Therefore, appropriate pressure and flow measurements must be made to estimate the characteristic impedance and to calculate the incident, or the reflected pressure wave at two separate locations a known distance apart (although there might be come conceptual problems with the term "wave reflection" in the arterial system).

Using two simultaneously measured pressure waves

An alternate method of measuring PWV utilizes the feature of the arterial waveform that during late diastole and early systole, there is no, or minimal, interference of the incident pressure wave by the reflected pressure wave.

Using pressure and flow

Bramwell & Hill cited the Moens-Kortweg equation and proposed a series of substitutions relevant to observable haemodynamic measures. Quoting directly, these substitutions were:
A similarity between the Moens-Kortweg equation and Newton's equation for the wave speed in a material is evident and both the Moens-Kortweg and Bramwell-Hill equations can be derived from Newton's equation for wave speed using the substitution of the equation of the bulk modulus in terms of volumetric strain.
