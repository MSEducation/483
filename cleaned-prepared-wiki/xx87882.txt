It laid the foundations of Indian mathematics and was influential in South Asia and its surrounding regions, and perhaps even Greece. Though this was primarily a geometrical text, it also contained some important algebraic developments, including the earliest list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically, geometric solutions of linear equations, the earliest use of quadratic equations of the forms ax2 = c and ax2 + bx = c, and integral solutions of simultaneous Diophantine equations with up to four unknowns.

=The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art=

Description:Contains the earliest description of Gaussian elimination for solving
system of linear equations, it also contains method for finding square root and cubic root.

=The Sea Island Mathematical Manual=

Description, contains the application of right angle triangles for survey of depth or height of distant objects.

=Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra=

Description: Also known as Elements of Algebra, Euler's textbook on elementary algebra is one of the first to set out algebra in the modern form we would recognize today.  The first volume deals with determinate equations, while the second part deals with Diophantine equations.  The last section contains a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for the case n = 3, making some valid assumptions regarding Q(√−3) that Euler did not prove.

Description: Gauss' doctoral dissertation, of the fundamental theorem of algebra.

Abstract algebra

=Group theory=

==Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations==

Description: The title means "Reflections on the algebraic solutions of equations". Made the prescient observation that the roots of the Lagrange resolvent of a polynomial equation are tied to permutations of the roots of the original equation, laying a more general foundation for what had previously been an ad hoc analysis and helping motivate the later development of the theory of permutation groups, group theory, and Galois theory. The Lagrange resolvent also introduced the discrete Fourier transform of order 3.

=Articles Publiés par Galois dans les Annales de Mathématiques=

Description: Posthumous publication of the mathematical manuscripts of Évariste Galois by Joseph Liouville.  Included are Galois' papers Mémoire sur les conditions de résolubilité des équations par radicaux and Des équations primitives qui sont solubles par radicaux.

=Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques=

Online version: Online version
Description: Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques (Treatise on Substitutions and Algebraic Equations).  The first book on group theory, giving a then-comprehensive study of permutation groups  and Galois theory.  In this book, Jordan introduced the notion of a simple group and epimorphism (which he called l'isomorphisme mériédrique),

=Theorie der Transformationsgruppen=

Publication data: 3 volumes, B.G. Teubner, Verlagsgesellschaft, mbH, Leipzig, 1888–1893.  Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3.
Description: The first comprehensive work on transformation groups, serving as the foundation for the modern theory of Lie groups.

=Solvability of groups of odd order=

Description: Gave a complete proof of the solvability of finite groups of odd order, establishing the long-standing Burnside conjecture that all finite non-abelian simple groups are of even order. Many of the original techniques used in this paper were used in the eventual classification of finite simple groups.

Description: Provided the first fully worked out treatment of abstract homological algebra, unifying previously disparate presentations of homology and cohomology for associative algebras, Lie algebras, and groups into a single theory.

=Sur Quelques Points d'Algèbre Homologique=

Description: Revolutionized homological algebra by introducing abelian categories and providing a general framework for Cartan and Eilenberg's notion of derived functors.

Algebraic geometry

Theorie der Abelschen Functionen

Publication data: Journal für die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik
Description: Developed the concept of Riemann surfaces and their topological properties beyond Riemann's 1851 thesis work, proved an index theorem for the genus (the original formulation of the Riemann–Hurwitz formula), proved the Riemann inequality for the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with prescribed poles (the original formulation of the Riemann–Roch theorem), discussed birational transformations of a given curve and the dimension of the corresponding moduli space of inequivalent curves of a given genus, and solved more general inversion problems than those investigated by Abel and Jacobi.  André Weil once wrote that this paper "is one of the greatest pieces of mathematics that has ever been written; there is not a single word in it that is not of consequence." [ref]

Faisceaux Algébriques Cohérents

Publication data: Annals of Mathematics, 1955
Description: FAC, as it is usually called, was foundational for the use of sheaves in algebraic geometry, extending beyond the case of complex manifolds.  Serre introduced Čech cohomology of sheaves in this paper, and, despite some technical deficiencies, revolutionized formulations of algebraic geometry.  For example, the long exact sequence in sheaf cohomology allows one to show that some surjective maps of sheaves induce surjective maps on sections; specifically, these are the maps whose kernel (as a sheaf) has a vanishing first cohomology group.  The dimension of a vector space of sections of a coherent sheaf is finite, in projective geometry, and such dimensions include many discrete invariants of varieties, for example Hodge numbers.  While Grothendieck's derived functor cohomology has replaced Čech cohomology for technical reasons, actual calculations, such as of the cohomology of projective space, are usually carried out by Čech techniques, and for this reason Serre's paper remains important.

Géométrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique

Description: In mathematics, algebraic geometry and analytic geometry are closely related subjects, where analytic geometry is the theory of complex manifolds and the more general analytic spaces defined locally by the vanishing of analytic functions of several complex variables. A (mathematical) theory of the relationship between the two was put in place during the early part of the 1950s, as part of the business of laying the foundations of algebraic geometry to include, for example, techniques from Hodge theory. (NB While analytic geometry as use of Cartesian coordinates is also in a sense included in the scope of algebraic geometry, that is not the topic being discussed in this article.) The major paper consolidating the theory was Géometrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique by Serre, now usually referred to as GAGA. A GAGA-style result would now mean any theorem of comparison, allowing passage between a category of objects from algebraic geometry, and their morphisms, and a well-defined subcategory of analytic geometry objects and holomorphic mappings.

Le théorème de Riemann–Roch, d'après A. Grothendieck

Description: Borel and Serre's exposition of Grothendieck's version of the Riemann–Roch theorem, published after Grothendieck made it clear that he was not interested in writing up his own result.  Grothendieck reinterpreted both sides of the formula that Hirzebruch proved in 1953 in the framework of morphisms between varieties, resulting in a sweeping generalization.[ref]
