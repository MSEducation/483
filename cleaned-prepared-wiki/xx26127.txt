Island of relative stability

. All other isotopes beyond bismuth are relatively or very unstable. So the main periodic table ends there (by geographical analogy, the shore edge of a continent; a continental shelf continues however, with shallows beginning at radium that rapidly drop off again after californium, with significant islands at thorium and uranium, as well as minor ones at e.g. plutonium, all of which is surrounded by a "sea of instability"Note graphic: Known and predicted regions of nuclear stability, surrounded by a "sea" of instability. cf. the Chart of Nuclides by half-life.) which renders such elements as astatine, radon, and francium extremely short-lived relative to all but the heaviest elements found so far.
Current theoretical investigation indicates that in the region Z = 106–108 and N ≈ 160–164, a small 'island/peninsula' might be stable with respect to fission and beta decay, such superheavy nuclei undergoing only alpha decay. Calculations in a quantum tunneling model show that such superheavy nuclei would undergo alpha decay within microseconds or less.

Synthesis problems

The manufacture of nuclei on the island of stability proves to be very difficult because the nuclei available as starting materials do not deliver the necessary sum of neutrons. For the synthesis of isotope 298 of flerovium, one could use an isotope of plutonium and one of calcium that together have a sum of at least 298 nucleons; for example, calcium-50 and plutonium-248. However, these and heavier isotopes are not available in measurable quantities, making production virtually impossible with current methods. The same problem exists for the other possible combinations of isotopes needed to generate elements on the island using target-projectile methods. It may be possible to generate the isotope 298 of flerovium, if the multi-nucleon transfer reactions would work in low-energy collisions of actinide nuclei.
One of these reactions may be:

Hypothetical second island

Recently, interest has been expressed over the possibility of a second island of stability. The idea of a second island of stability was presented by Yuri Oganessian at the 235th national meeting of the American Chemical Society. This new island would be centered around element 164 (Unhexquadium), especially isotope Uhq-482, with a stability similar to that of flerovium.springer.1007%2FBF01406719/lookinside/000.
