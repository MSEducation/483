TriMet, more formally known as the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon, is a public agency that operates mass transit in a region that spans most of the Portland metropolitan area in the U.S. state of Oregon. Created in 1969 by the Oregon legislature, the district replaced five private bus companies that operated in the three counties; Multnomah, Washington, and Clackamas. TriMet started operating a light rail system named MAX in 1986, and opened new lines in 1998 (Westside), 2001 (Airport), 2004 (Interstate Ave.), and 2009 (Clackamas), as well as a commuter rail line in 2009. It also operates the City of Portland-owned Portland Streetcar system.
In addition to rail lines, TriMet provides the region's bus system, as well as LIFT paratransit service. There are 625 buses in TriMet's fleet that operate on 79 routes. In Fiscal Year 2009, the entire system averaged almost 325,000 rides per weekday and operates buses and trains between the hours of approximately 5 a.m. and 2 a.m. with no "night owl" service. TriMet's annual revenues total $404 million, with over half of the revenues coming from a district-wide payroll tax. The district is overseen by a seven-person board of governors appointed by the state's governor.

General information

TriMet is "a municipal corporation of the State of Oregon", with powers to tax, issue bonds, and enact police ordinances and is governed by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the Governor of Oregon. TriMet It has its own boundary, which currently encompasses an area of about .  The TriMet district serves portions of the counties of Multnomah, Washington, and Clackamas; it extends from Troutdale to Forest Grove east to west, and from Sauvie Island to Oregon City and Estacada north to south. 
For more than 30 years the agency called itself Tri-Met, but it formally dropped the hyphen from its name in 2002, as part of a new corporate identity strategy involving a redesigned logo and new color scheme for its vehicles and other media. 

TriMet was formed in 1969 after disputes between the Portland city council and Rose City Transit Company, the private company that previously operated the bus system serving the city (but not its suburbs). The new public agency was created by an ordinance of the Portland city council, under provisions of a law enacted by the 1969 Oregon Legislature, and took over all of Rose City Transit's service and fleet effective December 1, 1969."Tri-Met Takes Bus Control; Strike Averted" (December 1, 1969). The Oregonian, p. 1. Bus service in the suburban portions of the metropolitan area was operated by four smaller private companies which had a common union and were collectively known as the "Blue Bus" lines: Portland Stages, Tualatin Valley Buses, Intercity Buses and Estacada-Molalla Stages.  These were taken over by TriMet on September 6, 1970."Federman, Stan (September 2, 1970). "Tri-Met Action Averts Strike Of Bus Drivers; Agency To Assume Operation Of Four Suburban Blue Lines". The Oregonian, p. 1.  Eighty-eight buses owned by the four suburban companies were transferred to TriMet,"Tri-Met To Get Blue Buses Sunday; New Suburban Runs To Start Tuesday" (September 5, 1970). The Oregonian, p.15. but many were found to be in poor condition"Tri-Met Takes Over Operation Of Blue Buses, Finds Rolling Stock In Bad Condition" (September 9, 1970). The Oregonian, p. 9. and the TriMet board soon took action to replace them with new buses.
Since September 2012, TriMet has used a "flat" fare system, with a single price (for each category of rider: adult, youth, senior or disabled) regardless of the length of the trip, rather than a distance-based fare system.  However, the single-fare tickets permit unlimited transfers to other routes within a two-hour period.
TriMet tickets and passes are also valid on the Portland Streetcar, which is owned by the City of Portland but operated mostly by TriMet personnel under a contract with the city. "Streetcar safety". The Oregonian, "Back on Track" special section, p. 20. 
In Fiscal Year 2011, TriMet operated a total of 625 buses on 79 lines, 127 MAX light rail cars on four lines, and 253 LIFT paratransit vehicles.  MAX and 12 of the bus lines are marketed as "Frequent Service" lines, scheduled to operate at headways of 17 minutes or better for most of the service day, seven days a week.
TriMet connects to several other mass transit systems:Other Local Transit Services. TriMet. Retrieved 2009-10-02.
TriMet also links to various local shuttle services operated by the following: Ride Connection, which serves Banks, Gaston, King City and North Plains; the Swan Island Transportation Management Association; the Tualatin Transportation Management Association; Intel; Nike; and Oregon Health & Science University, including the Portland Aerial Tram.
Long-range transportation planning for the metropolitan area is provided by Metro, an elected regional government.  Metro also has statutory authority to take over the day-to-day operations of TriMet, but has never exercised that power, as past studies of such a merger have found it to be problematic.

Rail lines

TriMet runs the MAX Light Rail (short for Metropolitan Area Express) system, and contracts with Portland and Western Railroad to operate the Westside Express Service (WES) commuter rail line.  Fares on MAX (as well as WES) are the same as TriMet bus fares, and fare collection uses a proof-of-payment system (or honor system) with ticket vending machines at each station. Fare inspectors patrol the system randomly. Incidents of violence on the system have led to calls for more security,
TriMet trains operate using reporting mark TMTC.
TriMet's rail lines include:
From 1991 until 2013, TriMet also operated the Portland Vintage Trolley service, which ran on a portion of the MAX system on most weekends.  It was reduced to only seven dates per year in 2011 and was discontinued entirely in December 2013. 92.  UK: LRTA Publishing Ltd.

Bus service

As of May 2012, TriMet was operating 79 bus routes. Of these, 12 were designated as "Frequent Service Lines", which the agency defines as having a headway of 17 minutes or less during weekday rush hours.  Each route is identified by both a number and a name. The numbers are mostly in the range 1–99, but there are currently four routes with three-digit numbers.  From 1969 until 1973, TriMet bus routes were named but not numbered, a practice inherited from Rose City Transit and the "Blue Bus" lines, but route numbers were assigned to all routes in August 1973."Tri-Met directors discontinue little-used experimental route" (August 7, 1973). The Oregonian, p. 15."Take a number .... It's a winner" (August 28, 1973). Tri-Met advertisement in The Oregonian, Section 2, p. 6.
The bus system includes 17 transit centers, facilities served by multiple bus routes, and 11 of these are at MAX stations. See List of TriMet transit centers.  TriMet buses began carrying bicycles on the front in 1992, on a trial basis on eight routes;Walker, Dee J. (June 18, 1992). "Tri-Met to kick off one-year trial of bike project". The Oregonian, p. C6. the experiment was judged a success and within three years the entire bus fleet had been fitted with bike racks."People will bike, walk" (editorial, February 21, 1995). The Oregonian, p. B6. Each rack can hold two bikes.
There has been controversy over whether bus drivers have the right to order passengers off the bus for any reason they see fit. This came up when a driver ordered a mother and her four children off a 57 bus after 11pm.katu.html This was the second such incident involving the same driver.katu.html

Fleet

Buses

TriMet's fleet includes 625 buses, in lengths of either 40 or 30 feet (12 or 9 meters).  The agency's fleet of paratransit vehicles included 253 minibuses and 15 vans as of mid-2012.
TriMet does not currently operate any 60-foot (18 m) articulated buses. In 1982, the agency introduced 87 such buses,Federman, Stan (January 24, 1982). "Introduction of articulated buses kicks off Tri-Met expansion". The Oregonian, p. B1. manufactured by Crown-Ikarus, a now-defunct partnership between Ikarus, of Hungary, and Crown Coach, of California, but experienced numerous problems with them,Federman, Stan (March 4, 1984). "No wonder the sour look: Tri-Met bendable buses 'lemons'". The Sunday Oregonian, p. 1. and has not purchased any more articulated buses. The last such buses were retired in 1999. However, over the intervening years the agency has introduced and expanded its MAX light rail system, which also uses higher-capacity, articulated vehicles.  In 1997, the TriMet board decided that all buses purchased in the future should be low-floor type and equipped with air-conditioning. "Tri-Met steers toward easy-access, air-conditioned fleet". The Oregonian, p. D1. The decision was for a gradual phase-out of high-floor, non-air-conditioned buses as they reach the ends of their normal lifespan (about 18–20 years), meaning that the transition was not expected to be completed until about 2013.
Two hybrid electric buses entered service in 2002,Boone, Jerry F. (May 6, 2002). "Tri-Met rolls out diesel-electric bus". The Oregonian. but in 2008 TriMet stated that the buses had not performed sufficiently better than its newest diesel buses to justify the estimated 50-percent-higher purchase cost, and that consequently the agency had no plans to purchase additional hybrid buses at that time. The two 2001-built hybrid buses were retired in 2012. However, with hybrid technology having improved since that earlier purchase, TriMet acquired four new hybrid buses in 2012 and placed them into service in January 2013 on line 72, a long, mostly level north–south route.
Since October 30, 2006, all TriMet buses and paratransit minibuses have been fueled by a B5 biodiesel blend.
In 2008 TriMet ordered 40 New Flyer D40LFR buses, 
TriMet's buses operate out of three garages: Powell Garage to the east, Merlo Garage on the west side, and the Center Street Garage in inner Southeast Portland.

Light rail (MAX)

There are 127 light rail vehicles, of three general types:  TriMet Type 1, Type 2/Type 3 (effectively identical) and Type 4. The first few cars of the latest type began to enter service in August 2009.
 
 Note on capacities: 

Commuter rail (WES)

Four rail cars built by Colorado Railcar operate on the commuter rail line between Beaverton and Wilsonville.
