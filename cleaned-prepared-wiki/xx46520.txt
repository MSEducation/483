Loretta Lynn (née Webb; born April 14, 1932) is a chart-topping, multiple-gold-album-selling American country music singer-songwriter whose work has spanned more than 50 years.  She has received numerous awards and other accolades for her groundbreaking role in country music and her documentation of, and contributions to, American culture. She has also authored at least six books, most of them autobiographies. Lynn was born to coal miner Melvin "Ted" Webb and wife Clara, née Ramey, in Butcher Hollow, near Paintsville, Kentucky, USA, the second of eight children.

Trailblazing path to stardom

In January 1948, shortly before she turned 16, Loretta married Oliver Vanetta Lynn, Jr. (1926–1996) and soon became pregnant. She and her husband moved to Washington state. Their marriage was tumultuous; he had affairs, but she stayed with him. Their life together helped inspire the music she wrote.
In 1953, on their sixth anniversary, when Loretta was 21, Oliver bought her a 17-dollar Harmony guitar. She taught herself to play. When she was 24, on their wedding anniversary, Oliver encouraged her to become a singer. She worked to improve her guitar playing and started singing at the Delta Grange Hall in Washington state with the Pen Brothers' band, The Westerners.  Lynn eventually cut her first record, "Honky Tonk Girl", in February 1960. She became a part of the country music scene in Nashville in the 1960s, and in 1967 charted her first of 16 number-one hits (out of 70 charted songs as a solo artist and a duet partner)Loretta Lynn at CMT. that include "Don't Come Home A' Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)", "You Ain't Woman Enough", "Fist City", and "Coal Miner's Daughter". 73.
Lynn focused on blue-collar women's issues with themes about philandering husbands and persistent mistresses, and pushed boundaries in the conservative genre of country music by singing about birth control ("The Pill"), repeated childbirth ("One's on the Way"), double standards for men and women ("Rated "X""), and being widowed by the draft during the Vietnam War ("Dear Uncle Sam").
Lynn has been performing for 53 years.  She has received numerous awards in country and American music; including being inducted into the Country Music Hall Of Fame in 1988, and the Song Writers Hall Of Fame in 2008. She was honored in 2010 at the Country Music Awards for her stellar career. Her most recent honor is the 2013 Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama (awarded also to Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, and Bob Dylan). Lynn has been a member of The Grand Ole Opry for 51 years, since joining on September 25, 1962. Her first appearance on the Grand Ole Opry was on October 15, 1960. In a press conference she said, "I've played in a million places, but the Grand Ole Opry is different." Lynn has recorded 70 albums, this includes 54 studio albums, 15 compilation albums, and 1 tribute album; and has sold over 48 million albums worldwide in her career.

Personal life

Birth, parents and siblings, and famous relatives

Born to Melvin "Ted" Webb (April 9, 1906 - February 22, 1959) and his wife Clara Marie (née Ramey; May 5, 1912 - November 24, 1981), Loretta was the second of eight children. She was named after film star Loretta Young,"About the Artist: Biography of Loretta Lynn". The Kennedy Center; accessed 2007-02-04. Ted Webb never got to see his daughter become famous, as he died a year before Loretta's first single, "I'm A Honky Tonk Girl", was released. Three of Loretta's siblings also pursued country music careers: her youngest sister, Crystal Gayle; sister Peggy Sue; and brother, Jay Lee Webb. 
Patty Loveless (born Patricia Ramey) is related to Loretta on Loretta's mother's side, as is Venus Ramey, Miss America 1944. 
Loretta was raised in Butcher Hollow, part of Van Lear, Kentucky, a mining community near Paintsville. Her mother was of Scots-Irish and Cherokee ancestry. Her father was a coal miner, storekeeper, and farmer. Her seven siblings are Melvin Webb Jr. (1929–1993); Herman (b. 1934); Jay Lee (1939–1996); Donald (b. 1943); Peggy Webb Wright (b. 1947); Betty Ruth (b. 1949); and Brenda Gail Webb, who became country singer Crystal Gayle (b. 1951).

Early adulthood

Loretta married Oliver Vanetta Lynn, commonly known as "Doolittle", "Doo" or "Mooney" (for running moonshine), on January 10, 1948, after meeting him December 10, 1947, and courting for a month. Mooney was 21 years old; Loretta was 15. In an effort to break free of the coal mining industry, the couple moved from Butcher Hollow to the logging community of Custer, Washington when she was 16 years old and seven months pregnant with the first of their six children.

Children and grandchildren

The Lynns had three children by the time Loretta was 19 and she gave birth to their fourth child, Cissie, by age 20. The Lynns had six children altogether:
Lynn has survived two of her six children. Jack Benny, who was Loretta's second child and eldest son, died at age 34 on July 22, 1984 while trying to ford the Duck River at the family's ranch in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee. Loretta's eldest child, daughter Betty Sue, died at age 64 from emphysema on July 29, 2013, near Loretta's ranch in Hurricane Mills. She became a grandmother at age 29 in 1961, three years before her twins were born. She has 21 grandchildren as of April 2014. Before her marriage, she regularly sang at churches and in local concerts in Butcher Hollow and sang continuously to her younger siblings. After marrying, she stopped singing in public, focusing on family life. She passed her love of music on to her children, often singing to them around the house, singing the hymns her mother taught her such as "The Great Titanic" and "In The Pines."

Husband

Although the Lynns were married for almost fifty years, (Mooney died on August 22, 1996 - their forty-ninth anniversary would have been on January 10, 1997) with six children, their marriage was reportedly rocky until Doolittle's death in 1996. In her 2002 autobiography, Still Woman Enough, and in an interview with CBS News the same year, Lynn recounts how her husband cheated on her regularly and once left her while she was giving birth. 

Homes

Lynn owns a ranch in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, billed as "The 7th Largest Attraction in Tennessee", featuring a recording studio, museums, lodging, restaurants, western stores, and other attractions. She normally holds three holiday concerts annually at her ranch: Memorial Day Weekend, Fourth of July Weekend, and Labor Day Weekend. 
Lynn's ranch, where she and her husband raised their children, is open for tourists to visit. For over 30 years the ranch hosted Lynn's Amateur Motocross National Championship, the world's largest amateur motocross race, in addition to GNCC Racing events. The ranch is centered around her large plantation home along with a replica of her parents' cabin in Butcher Hollow. She no longer lives in the plantation home.

Injury and recovery

In 2006, Lynn underwent shoulder surgery after injuring herself in a fall. However, due to complications during the procedure, she had to be revived by doctors. The surgery was successfully completed later."Loretta Lynn: Van Lear Rose (2004):Reviews". Metacritic. Accessed 2007-03-03.com, June 8, 2006, accessed March 30, 2012.

Music career in detail

1959–1966: Early country success

Lynn began singing in local clubs in mid 1959 with help, insistence, and support from her husband. She later formed her own band, the Trailblazers, which included her brother Jay Lee Webb. Lynn won a televised talent contest in Tacoma, Washington, hosted by Buck Owens, for which the prize was a wristwatch that broke 24 hours later(Lynn later laughed about it with Owens). Lynn's performance was seen by Canadian Norm Burley of Zero Records, who co-founded the record company after hearing Loretta sing. He was blown away and wanted Loretta to be heard from deejays all over the world."Van Lear Rose", LorettaLynn. Zero Records president Canadian Don Grashey arranged a recording session in Hollywood, where four of Lynn's own compositions were recorded: "I'm A Honky Tonk Girl", "Whispering Sea", "Heartache Meet Mister Blues", and "New Rainbow". Her first release featured "Whispering Sea" and "I'm a Honky Tonk Girl". She signed her first contract on February 2, 1960, with Zero Records; the material was recorded at United Western Recorders in Hollywood, engineered by Don Blake and produced by Grashey.,Koch Entertainment Loretta Lynn Biography."Honky Tonk Make Believe", Don Grashy - Co. Joseph Mauro, "MY RAMBLING HEART" (Washington. DC: 1995), p. 45. Musicians backing on the songs were "the great" steel guitar player Speedy West,Honky Tonk Girl: My Life in Lyrics.

It was a shuffle with a West Coast beat".
The Lynns then toured the country to promote the release to country stations, while Grashey and Del Roy took the music to KFOX in Long Beach, California. When the Lynns reached Nashville, the song was a hit, climbing to No. 14 on Billboard's C & W Chart, and Lynn began cutting demo records for the Wilburn Brothers' Publishing Company. Through the Wilburns, Lynn secured a contract with Decca Records. From the onset of her career fans took notice and rallied behind her all the way, with the first Loretta Lynn Fan Club formed in November 1960. By the end of the year Billboard magazine listed Loretta Lynn as the No. 4 Most Promising Country Female Artist. 
Lynn's relationship with the Wilburn Brothers and her appearances on the Grand Ole Opry, beginning in 1960, helped Lynn become the number one female recording artist in country music. Her contract with the Wilburn Brothers gave them the publishing rights to her material. She was still fighting to regain these rights 30 years after ending her business relationship with them but was ultimately denied the publishing rights. Lynn stopped writing music in the 1970s because of these contracts. Although Kitty Wells had become the first major female country vocalist during the 1950s, by the time Lynn recorded her first record, only three other women - Patsy Cline, Skeeter Davis, and Jean Shepard - had become top stars. Lynn joined The Grand Ole Opry on September 25, 1962. By the end of 1962 it was clear that she was on her way to becoming the fourth. Lynn has credited Cline as her mentor and best friend during those early years. In 2010, when interviewed for Jimmy Mcdonough's biography of Tammy Wynette, Tammy Wynette: Tragic Country Queen, Loretta mentioned having best friends in Patsy and Tammy during different times: "Best friends are like husbands. You only need one at a time." 
Lynn released her first Decca single, "Success," in 1962, and it went straight to #6, beginning a string of Top 10 singles that would run through the rest of the decade and throughout the next. She was a hard honky-tonk singer for the first half of the 1960s and rarely strayed from the genre. Between this time, Lynn soon began to regularly hit the Top 10 after 1964 with "Before I'm Over You", which peaked at No. 4, followed by "Wine, Women, and Song," which peaked at No. 3. In late 1964, she recorded a duet album with Ernest Tubb. Their lead single, "Mr. and Mrs. Used to Be," peaked within the Top 15. Together, the pair recorded two more albums, "Singin' Again" (1967) and "If we Put Our Heads Together" (1969). In 1965, her solo career continued with three major hits, "Happy Birthday", "Blue Kentucky Girl" (later recorded and made a Top 10 hit in the '70s by Emmylou Harris), and "The Home You're Tearing Down". Lynn's label issued two albums that year, "Songs from My Heart" and "Blue Kentucky Girl". While most of these songs were Top 10 Country hits, none of them reached  #1. 
Lynn's first self-penned song to crack the Top Ten, 1966's "Dear Uncle Sam", was among the very first recordings to recount the human costs of the Vietnam War.com; retrieved 2008-04-28. In the latter half of the decade, although she still worked within the confines of honky tonk, her sound became more personal, varied, and ambitious, particularly lyrically. Beginning with 1966's Number 1 hit in Cash Box, "You Ain't Woman Enough", Lynn began writing songs with a feminist viewpoint, which was unheard of in country music. This song made Lynn the first country female recording artist to pen a No. 1 hit.

1967–1980: Breakthrough success

In 1967, Lynn reached No. 1 with "Don't Come Home A' Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)". In Country Music: The Rough Guide. Orla Duane, Editor. London: Rough Guides Ltd. p. 311. "Don't Come Home A-Drinkin" went to No 1 and became one of the first albums by a female country artist to reach sales of 500,000 copies.com; retrieved 2008-04-28.
Lynn's next album, Fist City, was released in 1968. The title track became Lynn's second No. 1 hit, as a single in earlier that year, and the other single from the album, "What Kind of a Girl (Do You Think I Am)", peaked within the Top   10. In 1968, her next studio album, Your Squaw Is on the Warpath, spawned two Top 5 Country hits: the title track and "You've Just Stepped In (From Stepping Out on Me)". In 1969, her next single, "Woman of the World (Leave My World Alone)", was Lynn's third chart-topper, followed by a subsequent Top 10, "To Make a Man (Feel Like a Man)". Lynn was reportedly once inspired to write a song about a real woman she suspected was flirting with her husband. The song, "You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)", was an instant hit and became one of Lynn's all-time most popular. Her career continued to be successful into the 1970s, especially following the success of her hit "Coal Miner's Daughter", which peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Chart in 1970, and the album has sold over 5 million copies world wide. "Coal Miner's Daughter" tells the story of Lynn's life growing up in rural Butcher Hollow, Kentucky. The song later served as the impetus for the best-selling autobiography (1976) and the Oscar-winning biopic starring Academy Award Winner For Best Leading Actress Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones (1980), both of which share the song's title. Paul Kingsbury & Alanna Nash (eds.) London: Rough Guides Ltd., 2006, pg. 251 The song became her first single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 83. She had a series of singles that would chart low on the Hot 100 between 1970 and 1975. 
In 1973, Rated "X" peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Chart and was considered one of Lynn's most controversial hits. The next year, her next single, "Love Is the Foundation", also became a No. 1 country hit from her album of the same name. The second and last single from that album, "Hey Loretta", became a Top 5 hit. Lynn continued to reach the Top 10 until the end of the decade, including with 1975's "The Pill", considered to be the first song to discuss birth control, other than the 1967 French-language song in French, Pilule d'Or, sung by Luc Dominique. As a songwriter, Lynn felt no topic was off limits, as long as it spoke to other women, and many of her songs were autobiographical. In 1976, she released her autobiography, Coal Miner's Daughter, with the help of writer George Vecsey. It became a #1 bestseller, making Lynn the first country music artist to make the New York Times bestseller list. This opened a flood gate of country artists who followed with books. By the early 1980s Lynn became the first American female recording artist to chart over fifty top ten hits.

=Professional partnership with Conway Twitty=

In 1971, Lynn began a professional partnership with Conway Twitty.

For four consecutive years (1972–1975), Lynn and Twitty were named the "Vocal Duo of the Year" by the Country Music Association. The Academy of Country Music named them the "Best Vocal Duet" in 1971, 1974, 1975, and  1976. The American Music awards selected them as the "Favorite Country Duo" in 1975, 1976 and 1977.

In addition to their five Number 1 singles, they had seven other Top 10 hits between 1976 and 1981. Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty are the most successful and most awarded male/female duet teams in country music history. Conway and Loretta, their duo name, released an album in 1977 titled "Dynamic Duo" and were considered that by their many fans.
As a solo artist, Lynn continued to be very successful into 1971, achieving her fifth No. 1 solo hit, "One's on the Way", written by poet and songwriter Shel Silverstein. The songs that didn't reach the top spot peaked within the Top 10 during this time, "I Wanna Be Free", "You're Lookin' At Country" and 1972's "Here I Am Again", all released on separate albums. The next year, she became the first country star on the cover of Newsweek.com; retrieved 2008-04-18.

"Why Can't He Be You" peaked at #7 shortly afterward. Lynn enjoyed enormous success on country radio until the early 1980s, when a more pop-flavored type of country music began to dominate the market. She stayed within the country Top 10 until the mid-1980s; however, most of her music by the late '70s had a slick pop sound to it. Lynn had her last #1 hit in early 1978 with her solo single "Out of My Head and Back in My Bed." In 1979, she had two Top 5 hits, "I Can't Feel You Anymore" and "I've Got a Picture Of Us on My Mind", from separate albums. Lynn would often sit for an hour or more onstage signing autographs to her fans after a performance. Once in Salisbury, Maryland, the town's newspaper editor interviewed her while she was signing autographs. Editor Mel Toadvine asked her why she took so much time to sign autographs while more than 100 people stood in line all the way to the front of the Wicomico Youth and Civic Center. "These people are my fans ... I'll stay here until the very last one wants my autograph. Without these people, I am nobody. I love these people", she told Toadvine. In 1979, she became the spokeswoman for Procter & Gamble's Crisco oil and did TV commercials and print ads for them for a decade, ending in 1989.
