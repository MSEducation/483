During one of the events, Simmes challenged Miceli to a title unification match (NWA United States Women's Title and AWA World Women's Title), but the match never happened. At another event, former NWA World Women's Champion Debbie Combs challenged Simmes for the NWA United States Women's Championship, but Simmes was unable to accept due to an arm injury she had sustained.
