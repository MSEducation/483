Paul Parker "Maggie" Magoffin (March 30, 1883 – February 1, 1956)Bentley Historical Library Necrology File. was an American football player.  He played left halfback for Fielding H. Yost's University of Michigan Wolverines football teams of 1904, 1905, 1906 and 1907, and was captain of the 1907 team.  He later served as a football coach at North Dakota State University and George Washington University.

Early years

Magoffin first played football on a Kansas high school team.  He later ran track and played two years of football for Central High School in Washington, D.C.

University of Michigan

In 1904, Magoffin transferred to the University of Michigan, began playing on the freshman team, but played in several games for the varsity team, though he was not awarded a varsity letter for the 1904 season.  He became a starter at left halfback for the 1905 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 12–1 record and outscored its opponents by a combined total of 495 to 2.   The Michigan Alumnus in January 1907 described Magoffin's contributions as follows: "Magoffin has shown himself to be a remarkably fast and untiring player on both offense and defense, although slow in rounding into physical shape, owing to his later return to the University.  He did his greatest work in the Pennsylvania contest, fighting gamely and stubbornly to the end.  His repeated fierce tackling of Hollenbeck for losses was one of the redeeming features of that game for the Michigan spectators." 
On November 3, 1907, Magoffin became the first player to catch a forward pass for a touchdown in a Michigan – Ohio State game, a 25-yard pass from quarterback Billy Wasmund.

Coaching and officiating

In July 1908, after graduating from the University of Michigan as part of the literary class of 1908, Magoffin was hired as the athletic director and head football coach for the North Dakota Agricultural College "Aggies," now known as the North Dakota State Bison. 
In 1910, Magoffin was the football coach for the George Washington University "Hatchetities" in Washington, D.C.
Magoffin served as an official in college and high school football games for at least 32 years from 1912 to 1943.  In December 1914, he was married in Philadelphia to Edith Jane Young.
He died in 1956 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
