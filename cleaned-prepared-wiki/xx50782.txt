History

The Beginning: 1994–1998

On June 15, 1994, Major League Soccer announced that Columbus, Ohio, would be home to one of the ten founding members of the new top flight North American professional soccer league.  Columbus had promised construction of a soccer–specific stadium and had sold over 12,000 season ticket deposits.

The Crew finished 15–17 in both 1997 and 1998, which put them in third and fourth place, respectively, in the Eastern Conference.  Each season ended with losses in the Conference Finals to D.C. United. The Crew reached the 1998 U.S. Open Cup Final, which was postponed due to a hurricane and controversially relocated from Virginia Beach to Soldier Field in Chicago then the home of Chicago Fire, who won the match 2 to 1 after extra time.  Stern John, in his first of two seasons with Columbus, was the 1998 scoring champion, amassing 26 goals and 5 assists.

The Crew's 1999 season began with the opening of Columbus Crew Stadium, the first soccer–specific stadium in the United States. Columbus won their first game in the stadium, 2–0, against New England Revolution in front of a sell–out crowd of 24,741.

The 1999 season was the last for Stern John who scored 52 goals in 65 games for the club.
Dante Washington was acquired from the Dallas Burn to replace John, but his 13 goals in 2000 was not enough to propel the Crew to the playoffs.  For the first time, Columbus failed to reach the postseason. Columbus got off to a slow 1–3–2 start in 2001, which led to the replacement of coach Tom Fitzgerald.  Fitzgerald, who had coached 161 of the Crew's first 183 MLS matches over parts of six seasons between 1996 and 2001, was replaced by Greg Andrulis.  Andrulis would lead the Crew to a 2nd place finish in 2001 but the team was ousted from the playoffs in the league quarterfinals.

Transitions: 2004–2006

With the departure of McBride, the Crew added Robin Fraser and Simon Elliott to the club.  These additions proved to be vital as Fraser went on to win the Defender of the Year award in 2004.  The Crew set a franchise record for points, 49, by going 12–5–13, thanks in part to an 18–game unbeaten streak (8–0–10) to end the season.

Colors and badge

Prior to the initial MLS season a city-wide public contest was created to decide the name for the team, the very first entry was a hit, and The Columbus Crew was born.
The club badge - unique amongst MLS teams in that it features people - contains three silhouetted males wearing construction hats beneath a stylized "Crew" wordmark. The logo is intended to represent a crew of hard working people, much like the hard working, blue collar image the city of Columbus cultivates.
The official colors of the Columbus Crew are black and gold. The Crew's usual primary jersey is predominately bright yellow with black trim, and has been nicknamed the "banana kit" or "canary kit" by fans. 
The alternate kit is usually black, but is seldom worn by the Crew, due to the strong favor shown to the all yellow home kit, and due to the fact that the black jerseys compound the heat of summer in the United States. Only occasionally has Crew not worn a black or yellow jersey.  In 2007, the Crew wore a predominantly white away shirt with yellow trim, and in 1997 they wore a white away shirt with yellow and black striped "bumblebee"-style sleeves.

Stadium

Initially the Columbus Crew played their home games at the 102,000-capacity Ohio Stadium, home of the Ohio State Buckeyes American college football team. They ended with a 33-20 record while playing there.
On May 15, 1999, the Crew opened Columbus Crew Stadium, the first soccer-specific stadium in Major League Soccer, as the Crew beat the New England Revolution 2-0 before a sold-out crowd of 24,741.  It has been the model stadium for the rest of the league, and one of the stadiums used by the United States national team in World Cup qualifying.

Revenue and Profitability

Having lost money in 2011, in 2012 the Crew identified three financial goals with the aim of achieving financial stability. First, the team wanted a new jersey sponsor, which it achieved when they reached a deal with Barbasol.  Second, the team wanted to sell naming rights to the Columbus Crew Stadium, hoping for $15 million over 10 years.  Third, the Crew had announced in September 2011 that it aimed to increase season-ticket sales from its current levels (later revealed to be 4,000) to 10,000. 19, 2012,  19, 2012,  Business First, Columbus Crew getting season-ticket boost from U.S.-Mexico packages, August 9, 2013, 

Sponsors

The Crew signed a five-year deal in early 2012 with Barbasol as the team's shirt sponsor. The deal with Barbasol — which is based in Dublin, Ohio — is the most lucrative sponsorship deal in franchise history, although financial terms were not disclosed.sportsbusinessdaily.aspx 
Previously, Glidden was the Crew's shirt sponsor from 2008 to 2010, a deal worth $1 million per year.

Club culture

Supporters: The Nordecke Transformation

Before the 2008 season, the Columbus Crew front office demolished the north stands where the most ardent of Crew supporters stood, in order to build a stage that would provide additional revenue by facilitating concerts and other events. Prior to this, the team's three supporters groups (Crew Supporters Union, Hudson Street Hooligans, and La Turbina Amarilla) sat apart because of differences between the groups ranging from age to ethnicity. The building of the stage forced the groups to come together into the north corner of the stadium, forming one large block of vocal and artistic support. Putting their differences aside the three groups formed the "Nordecke," (pronounced Nort-'eck'-eh) which is German for "North Corner." The name "Nordecke" celebrates the city's German heritage.
In 2008 a large contingency of fans from the Nordecke began traveling together to support the Crew during their away campaigns.  In late 2009/early 2010 the term "NorOnTour" became popular thanks to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, to describe the frequent large and rowdy traveling support.

Rivalries

The Crew has a rivalry with the Chicago Fire. Columbus Crew - MLS #12 - Three Questions, May 25, 2012,  Columbus is roughly a six-hour drive away from Chicago. Due to the relative close proximity of the two cities, it is not uncommon for supporters of both teams to make the trip to support their club in matches between the two. In the 2008 season, Columbus defeated Chicago in the Eastern Conference Championship match.
MLS frames matches between Toronto FC and Columbus as a rivalry, creating a trophy called the Trillium Cup, awarded to the team that wins the rivalry.
The Crew contests F.C. Dallas for the Lamar Hunt Pioneer Cup. Lamar Hunt was the owner of both of these teams until his death.
