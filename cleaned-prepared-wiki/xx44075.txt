[[AmigaOne]]

CATEGORIES: Amiga, PowerPC mainboards, AmigaOS4

AmigaOne is a series of computers intended to run AmigaOS4 developed by Hyperion Entertainment. Earlier models were produced by Eyetech, and were based on the Teron series of PowerPC POP mainboards. In January 2010, A-Eon Technology announced a new computer, the AmigaOne X1000, which features a dual core PowerPC motherboard, and is also intended to run AmigaOS4.x.

History

Originally, AmigaOne was the name of a project for new computer hardware to run Amiga OS4. Initially it was managed by Eyetech and designed by the German company Escena GmbH. The AmigaOne motherboard was to be available in two models, the AmigaOne-1200 and the AmigaOne-4000. It was announced to have connectors for an optionally attached Amiga 1200 or an Amiga 4000 respectively, in order to use the old custom chips of an Amiga for backwards compatibility. This would probably not have been actually possible. This AmigaOne project was cancelled in the design stage in 2001, mostly due to the inability to find or design a suitable northbridge chip. Eyetech, who at this point had invested funds into the project, were forced instead to licence the Teron CX board from Mai to form the basis of the new AmigaONE computer range.
The main difference between the ATX-format AmigaOne SE and XE was that the AmigaOne SE had a soldered-on 600 MHz PowerPC 750CXe processor, whereas the AmigaOne XE used a CPU board attached to a MegArray connector on the motherboard. While the MegArray connector is physically similar to the Apple Power Mac G4 CPU daughtercard connector, it is not electrically compatible. There were G3 and G4 options with a maximum clock frequency of 800 MHz and 933 MHz. The G4 module originally used a Freescale 7451 processor which was later changed to a Freescale 7455, both without level 3 cache. The G4 CPU runs hotter and requires a better heatsink than that supplied on some machines. Consequently, the G4 was often supplied underclocked to run at 800 MHz. In 2007 Acube offered 1.267 GHz 7457(See below). The Micro-A1 was announced in two configurations, under the Micro-A1 I (Industrial) and Micro-A1 C (Consumer) labels. Only the C configuration was produced.
Both AmigaOneG3-XE and AmigaOneG4-XE has four 32-bit PCI-slots (3x 33 MHz, 1x 66 MHz) and one AGP-2x slot. The Micro-A1 has only one 32-bit PCI-slot and an integerated Radeon 7000 via AGP with dedicated 32 MB VRAM.
When the AmigaOne boards first became available, AmigaOS4 was not ready: they were supplied with various Linux distributions. From April 2004 onwards, boards were shipped for developers with prerelease version of OS4. The Final Update of OS4 was released in December 2006 for AmigaOne computers only, with the PowerUP version being released in December 2007. AmigaOS4.1 for AmigaOne was released on September 2008.

Current status

MAI Logic Inc. went bankrupt, and consequently the supply for the Eyetech AmigaOnes dried up. Eyetech Group Ltd stopped the sales of the MicroA1 and retired from the market.
In February 2010, a new company A-Eon Technology, in co-operation with Hyperion Entertainment, officially announced a new AmigaOne model, the AmigaOne X1000. The project was delayed but the new platform was launched in 2012 with AmigaOS4.1.5.
In October 2011, Hyperion Entertainment announced that it was launching an AmigaOne netbook in mid-2012,
Unfortunately this notebook was never released like so many AmigaOS4 related projects. 
Also at Amiwest 2013, A-Eon Technology announced three new AmigaOne motherboards, with the project temporarily named Cyrus as a new name hasn't been chosen yet as of 14 November 2013.
A-Eon has a list a of proposed names which can be voted for.
The new motherboards are aimed to replace the AmigaOne X1000.
Lastly, A-Eon Technology announced at Amiwest 2013 that A-Eon signed a 1.2 million-dollar investment contract with Ultra Varisys for the ongoing design, development and manufacture of PowerPC hardware for its AmigaOne line of desktop computers.

Other AmigaOS4 compatible models

The Sam440 mainboard (complete with AMCC PowerPC 440EP SoC) is an embedded motherboard launched by Acube Systems in September 2007. AmigaOS4 was released for the Sam440 in October 2008.
The Sam460ex mainboard (complete with AMCC 460ex SoC, PowerPC 440 core) is an embedded motherboard launched by Acube Systems in April 2010. AmigaOS4 was released for the Sam460ex in January 2011.
The Pegasos II mainboard (complete with PPC G3 and G4 CPU) is a MicroATX motherboard launched by Genesi and discontinued in 2006. AmigaOS4 was released for the Pegasos II in January 2009.
