Contents

The 20-minute video presents a critical vision of consumerist society, primarily American. It purports to expose "the connections between a huge number of environmental and social issues, and calls us together to create a more sustainable and just world." The video is divided into seven chapters: Introduction, Extraction, Production, Distribution, Consumption, Disposal, and Another Way.
The video divides up the materials economy into a system composed of extraction, production, distribution, consumption, and disposal. To articulate the problems in the system, Leonard adds people, the government, and corporations.
Leonard's thesis, "you cannot run a linear system on a finite planet indefinitely" is supported throughout the video by statistical data.  Although the video itself doesn't give attribution to her information, the producers provide an annotated script that includes footnotes with explanations and sources for some of her assertions:

Reaction

The Story of Stuff has been subject to public discussion, especially after The New York Times published a front page article about the video on May 10, 2009."  Glenn Beck, host of the Glenn Beck TV program on Fox News, characterized the video as an "anti-capitalist tale that unfortunately has virtually no facts correct."Debunking Story of Stuff, Glennbeck,com, September 22, 2009  Beck's website used a detailed critique made by Lee Doren of the Competitive Enterprise Institute in his "How the World Works" YouTube channel. FoxNews."Viral Video 'The Story of Stuff' Is Full of Misleading Numbers, FoxNews.com, May 14, 2009
Even before The New York Times article, The Sustainable Enterprise Fieldbook pointed to The Story of Stuff as a successful portrayal of the problems with the consumption cycle, says it is an engaging attempt to communicate circular economics.  Ralph Nader called the film "a model of clarity and motivation." John Passacantando,  Executive Director of Greenpeace, called it a "mega-hit on three levels".
Libertarian and politically conservative critics have characterized the documentary as misleading left-wing propaganda; one Montana school board opposed the screening of the film in a biology classroom in a 4–3 vote.
