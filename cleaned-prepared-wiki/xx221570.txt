Jay Jay Burridge also known as Jay Burridge (born 12 January 1971) is an artist and former television presenter. He fronted the BBC children's art programme SMart from 1994 until 2003, when he left and became a graphic designer and snowboard inventor. He was a close friend of colleague Mark Speight.

Career

He graduated from Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design with a degree in art, and in 1994 auditioned for the role as a presenter on the BBC children's art programme SMart.
Together, Burridge and Speight created all of the art projects for each episode of SMart at Burridge's West London art studio. He noted: "We would bounce ideas and jokes off each other all day until we had developed an almost telepathically linked knowledge of what made each other laugh."
Burridge left SMart in 2003, feeling he had "outgrown his role as a children's TV presenter," and wanted to move "out of the limelight". He worked as a commercial artist before becoming a producer for a TV company, as well as working as a graphic designer and snowboard inventor.
Burridge directed the music video for the song "Inspired By" by The Brightlights and was art director on Hot Chip's "Boy from School" video, for which he won a Cads Music Vision Award.

Personal life

Burridge is married. He was close friends with Speight and the two formed an "on- and off-screen double act" and regularly attended the Regency Rooms comedy nights together. Following the death of Speight's fianc√©e Natasha Collins in January 2008, Burridge met up with him on several occasions and "tried to get him to see that the worst was over", although he realised that Speight "might not be able to keep going". Burridge spoke to Speight on 7 April 2008 and arranged to meet up with him later in the day. Speight, however, disappeared and committed suicide later that day.
