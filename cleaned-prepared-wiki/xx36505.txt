[[Pakicetidae]]

CATEGORIES: Pakicetidae

Pakicetidae ("Pakistani whales") is an extinct family of early whales that lived during the latest Early Eocene to early Middle Eocene on the shores of the Indian subcontinent and existed for approximately 

Description


The pakicetid goldmine is the "H-GSP Locality 62" site in the Kala Chitta Hills where fossils from all three genera have been found.  Problem is, this site is so littered with bones that identifying bones from a single individual is impossible, and pakicetid skeletons are consequently composites of bones from several individuals.
Pakicetids have been found in or near river deposits in northern Pakistan and northwestern India, a region which was probably arid with only temporal streams when these animals lived there.  No pakicetids have been found in marine deposits, and they were apparently terrestrial or freshwater animals.  Their long limbs and small hands and feet also indicate they were poor swimmers.  Their bones are heavy and compact and were probably used as ballast; they clearly indicate pakicetids were not fast runners notwithstanding their otherwise cursorial morphology.  Most likely, pakicetids lived in or near bodies of freshwater and their diet can have included both land animals and aquatic organisms.

Hearing

Pakicetid ears had an external auditory meatus and ear ossicles (i.e. incus, malleus, tympanic ring, etcetera) similar to those in living land mammals and most likely used normal land mammal hearing in air.  In the pakicetid mandible, the mandibular foramen is small and comparable in size to those of extant land mammals and the acoustic mandibular fat pad characteristic of later whales was obviously not present.  The lateral wall of the mandible is also relatively thick in pakicetids, further preventing sound transmission through the jaw.  The tympanic bulla in pakicetid ears is similar to those in all cetaceans, with a relatively thin lateral wall and thickened medial part known as the involucrum.  However, in contrast to later cetaceans, the tympanic bone makes contact with the periotic bone which is firmly attached to the skull leaving no space for isolating air sinuses, effectively preventing directional hearing in water. Pakicetids most likely used bone conduction for hearing in water.

Locomotion

Interpretations of pakicetid habitat and locomotion behaviour varies considerably:

Furthermore, according to Thewissen et al., the pakicetid scapulae have large supraspinous fossae with small acromions, in contrast to other cetaceans.  The deltopectoral crests are absent in the long and slender humeri like in cursorial animals but unlike other Eocene cetaceans.  Pakicetid elbows are rigid hinge joints like in running mammals and the forearms are not flattened like in truly aquatic cetaceans.  In the pakicetid pelvis, the innominates are large and the ischia are longer than the ilia.  The pakicetid tibiae are long with a short tibial crest.  Hindlimb features that all more reminiscent of running and jumping animals than swimming ones.
: postcranial morphology and microstructural features suggest that pakicetids were adapted to an aquatic lifestyle which included bottom wading, paddling, and undulatory swimming, but probably not sustained running.  Isotopic evidence indicate Pakicetids spent a considerable part of their life in freshwater and probably ate freshwater prey.
