Hale County is a county of the U.S. state of Alabama. It is named in honor of Confederate officer Stephen Fowler Hale.  Its county seat is Greensboro and it is part of the Tuscaloosa Metropolitan Statistical Area.

History

Hale County was established following the end of the American Civil War, on January 30, 1867.  Located in the west-central section of the state, it was created from portions of Greene, Marengo, Perry, and Tuscaloosa counties.  The vast majority came from Greene County.  The first American settlers hailed from Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and the Carolinas.
Hale County is connected to three major twentieth century artists: Walker Evans photographed the area in 1936 while he collaborated with James Agee on the 1941 book Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. Since the 1960s, artist William Christenberry, born in Tuscaloosa, has been photographing various structures in Hale County as part of his multi-media artistic investigations. More recently, Hale County has become the home of the nationally-recognized Auburn University Rural Studio, an architectural outreach program founded by architect and artist Samuel Mockbee and D. K. Ruth.  It is also the birthplace of Eugene Sawyer, the second African American mayor of Chicago.
Since the American Civil War, whites controlled economic and political power in Hale County. However, in 1997 after a highly contested mayoral election the city of Greensboro elected its first African American mayor, John E. Owens Jr., and appointed its first African American police chief, Claude E. Hamilton. In 2006, county residents elected their first African American sheriff, Kenneth W. Ellis, who was formerly the Moundville police chief.

Tourism

Greensboro, the county seat, is home to the 'Safe House Museum'.  On March 21, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. attended a meeting at Greensboro's St. Matthew Church, and then spent the night in this house where he sought refuge from the Ku Klux Klan.  The museum reveals the struggle for equality for African Americans in Alabama, and its curator, Ms. Theresa Burroughs, was both a family friend of King, and a foot soldier in the Civil Rights Movement.[ref]
