[[Dual SIM]]

CATEGORIES: Mobile phones, Mobile telecommunications

A dual SIM mobile phone is one which holds two SIM cards.
Devices that use more than two SIM cards have also been developed and released, notably the LG A290 triple SIM phone,

History

The first phone to include dual SIM functionality was the Benefon Twin, released by Benefon in 2000.
Such phones were initially eschewed by major manufacturers due to potential pressure from telecommunications companies,

Types

Adapters

Prior to the introduction of dual SIM phones, adapters were made for phones to accommodate two SIMs, and to switch between them when required.

Passive/Standby

Dual SIM switch phones, such as the Nokia C1-00, are effectively a single SIM device as both SIMs share the same radio, and thus are only able to place or receive calls and messages on one SIM at the time. They do, however, have the added benefit of alternating between cards when necessary.

Active

Dual SIM active phones, however, come with two transceivers, and are capable of receiving calls on both SIM cards, at the cost of increased battery consumption.

Reception

Dual SIM phones have become popular especially with business users either as cosmetically-identical clones of the originals, or in completely different designs, with the logo of a notable manufacturer present in order to take advantage of brand recognition or brand image.
Dual SIM phones are common in developing countries, especially in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, with local firms like Karbonn Mobiles, Micromax and Cherry Mobile releasing feature phones and smartphones incorporating multiple SIM slots.
