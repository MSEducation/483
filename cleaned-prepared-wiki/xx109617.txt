The Audi S6 is the high performance variant of the Audi A6, an executive car produced by German automaker Audi.com North American S6 Model Guide - historical S6 specifications, prices, and options  It went on sale in 1994, shortly after the "A6" designation was introduced, replacing the "100" nameplate.
The original S6 (Ur-S6) was largely the same car as the outgoing, original Audi S4 (C4) (Ur-S4), with the only visible differences being new body-cladding and badging. In certain markets where the even-higher performance RS6 which is also based on the A6 is not sold, the S6 is the most powerful A6 trim there.
The S6, like all Audi "S" models, is fitted as standard with Audi's trademark quattro four-wheel drive (4WD) system, the S6 using the Torsen-based permanent 4WD.


C4 (Typ 4A, 1994–1997)

Audi was restructuring their model lineup in early and mid-1990s, and in late 1994, began selling the fifth generation (C4) Audi 100 model, re-badged as the Audi A6.  Wanting to keep a sports-saloon in their lineup, the company made small revisions to what was previously known as the Audi S4, renaming it the Audi S6; the S4 name would eventually be re-used for a completely different model derived from Audi's smaller Volkswagen Group B platform-based Audi A4.  As this was the first S6 model from Audi, it is commonly referred to as the Ur-S6, derived from the German augmentive, "Ursprünglich" (meaning: original).
It was available as both a saloon/sedan (typ 4A5), and an "Avant" (typ 4A9) (estate/wagon) to European and United States customers, but only as a saloon in Canada, Asia and Australia.  Audi's trademark "procon-ten" safety system was standard fitment.

C4 powertrain

From its launch in late 1994, the Audi S6 was powered by a  being reached in 17.5 seconds.
The vehicle was available with a standard six-speed manual transmission (five-speed only in North America), and Audi's dynamic Torsen T-1 quattro permanent four-wheel drive system.
Audi made a high-performance, 4.2 litre V8 engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AEC) with a Bosch KE-Motronic ECU available as an option in the original European S4s, and made the decision to continue to do so with the S6, making a  version of the 4.2 available as an optional upgrade over the 2.2 litre inline five-cylinder turbo.  Unlike the five-cylinder turbocharged version, the V8-powered S6 was supplied with a four-speed automatic transmission as standard, but kept the quattro four wheel drive.  A six-speed manual gearbox was also available as an option.

C4 brakes, wheels and tyres

C4 braking system included radially ventilated disc brakes front and rear; with  discs with Lucas single-piston sliding calipers at the rear.  Bosch Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with EDS was also standard.
Standard wheels were 7½Jx16 "Avus" cast aluminium alloy wheels with 225/50 R16 tyres. Later cars received 8Jx17 "Avus" wheels with 255/40 R17 tyres.  An optional 7½Jx15 five-arm alloy wheel, with 215/60 R15 tyres, an 8Jx16 five double-spoke alloy, an 8Jx17 10-spoke alloy were also available.

Audi S6 PLUS

As a swan song to the C4 platform, an even more powerful, and very limited-production Audi S6 PLUS was briefly available to European customers.  The S6 PLUS, developed by Audi's wholly owned high performance subsidiary, quattro GmbH, was available for sale during the 1997 model year only (production from June 1996 to October 1997).  A total of 952 cars were produced–855 Avant, and 97 saloons.
It was powered by another version of the 32 valve (four valves per cylinder) 4.2 litre V8 engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AHK, later to be seen in the Audi S8 as AKH).  Audi's performance division reworked key parts of the internal combustion engine, increasing the motive power to .  It was only available with a revised six-speed manual transmission (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: DGU) (gear ratios - 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.730), with a final drive ratio of 4.111.
Further revisions were made to the suspension, brakes and roadwheels.  The front brake discs were enlarged to  thick.  Standard roadwheels were 8Jx17 "Avus" cast aluminium alloy wheels, with an optional 7Jx16 alloy wheel for use with winter tyres was also available.
With so much power on tap, the S6 Plus saloon could reach  from a standstill in 5.6 seconds, with the Avant a tenth of a second slower at 5.7 seconds, making it comparable in terms of acceleration to vehicles like the Porsche 944 Turbo.
Hella xenon high intensity discharge (HID) headlamps (still with the C4s triple bulb design) were available as an option.

C5 (Typ 4B, 1999–2003)

In late 1997, Audi introduced an all-new range of Audi A6 models, based on the Volkswagen Group C5 platform.  A new Audi S6, now officially known as the Audi S6 quattro appeared in 1999, to complement its A6 platform-mate.  It was available in a four-door saloon/sedan and a five-door Avant (estate/wagon).  In North America, the Avant bodystyle was the only version available.  The vehicle could accelerate from standstill to .
This generation of S6 went out of production in 2003.

C5 powertrain

The engine was a new rubber-hydro mounted all-aluminium alloy 4.2 litre 40-valve (five valves per cylinder) 90° V8 (parts code: 077, identification codes: AQJ 99-May 1, ANK 00-onwards). It had double overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank and solenoid-operated magnesium two-stage variable intake manifold.  It displaced  of torque at 3,400 rpm.  It satisfied the European Union EU3 emissions standard, and was managed by a Bosch Motronic ME 7.1.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU) with manifold-sited sequential fuel injection, mapped direct ignition with eight individual spark coils, Bosch longlife spark plugs, four heated lambda sensors and two catalytic converters, cylinder-selective knock control and a Bosch "E-Gas" drive by wire throttle.  The engine was cooled with the aid of two electric cooling fans, replacing the single viscous fan of earlier models.
An oil-cooled six-speed manual transmission (parts code: 01E, identification code: EEY) was standard; the gear ratios were: 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.730; and final drive ratio: 4.111. An optional ZF 5HP24A five-speed tiptronic automatic transmission (parts code: 01L, identification codes: EFN 99-May 1, FBD 00-onwards) (gear ratios: 1st: 3.571, 2nd: 2.200, 3rd: 1.508, 4th: 1.000, 5th: 0.803; and final drive ratio: 2.909), with steering wheel-mounted paddle-shifts, and "Dynamic Shift Programme" (DSP) was available.  Torsen T-2 based dynamic quattro permanent four-wheel drive was also standard.  Both front and rear axles utilised "Electronic Differential Lock" (EDL), which is a function of the Bosch ESP 5.7 Electronic Stability Programme.

C5 suspension and steering

Compared to its A6 sibling, the suspension on the S6 was stiffened and lowered by , and utilised gas-pressurised shock absorbers.
ZF rack and pinion "servotronic" speed-sensitive power steering was standard.

C5 brakes, wheels and tyres

Brakes consisted of radially vented brake discs front and rear.  The fronts are sized at , and use a Lucas single-piston sliding caliper.
Bosch ESP 5.7 Electronic Stability Programme, with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Brake Assist, and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) completed the brake system.
Wheels are 8Jx17" cast alloy "Avus" 6-spoke alloy wheels, with 255/40 ZR17 tyres.

C5 body and interior

The body panels were largely based on the Audi A6 4.2 model, with slightly flared wheel arches and door sills, with the bonnet (hood) and front wings being constructed from aluminium.  Other features included S6 badging, bolstered seats (optional Recaro seats), polished aluminium exterior door mirror housings, unique front grille, and rear bootlid/tailgate spoiler.

Audi RS 6 (C5)

A higher performance Audi RS 6 was also available from 2002 to 2004.  It was built by Audi's high performance private subsidiary quattro GmbH. It used a twin-turbo ("biturbo") version of the 4.2 litre V8 engine (identification code: BCY). Power output was  from 1,950 to 5,600 rpm.  Transmission was a five-speed tiptronic automatic.
Wheels and tyres were upgraded to  at the rear.

C6 (Typ 4F, 2006–2011)

The Audi S6 5.2 FSI quattro (Typ 4F) was introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in January.
The high-performance version of the C6 Audi A6, the S6 uses the Volkswagen Group C6 platform, and is available in saloon/sedan and Avant (estate/wagon) bodystyles.  Factory production started in June 2006. A facelifted version of the S6 was released in late 2008 for the 2009 model year.

C6 powertrain

The engine in the C6 S6 is an all-aluminium alloy  of torque from 3,000 to 4,000 rpm.  It uses twin chain-driven double overhead camshafts with variable valve timing for both intake and exhaust valves. The engine is managed by a Bosch Motronic MED 9.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU), which controls the mapped direct ignition, ten individual spark coils, common rail cylinder-direct sequential multi-point fuel injection, and drive-by-wire throttle.
A ZF 6HP26 six-speed tiptronic automatic transmission (parts code: 09E, identification codes: JBW, JMS, KHD, JLL) (gear ratios - 1st: 4.171, 2nd: 2.340, 3rd: 1.521, 4th: 1.143, 5th: 0.867, 6th: 0.691), with steering wheel-mounted "paddle-shifters" is the only transmission available. Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive - initially with the T-2 symmetrical differential, and from 2007 model year with the latest 40:60 front:rear asymmetric/dynamic Torsen T-3 differential, is standard.  The final drive ratio is 3.801.  Traction is assisted "Electronic Differential Lock" (EDL) and "Anti-Slip Regulation" (ASR) (commonly known as traction control system) - both functions of the Bosch ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme.
The same engine is used in the latest Audi D3 S8, but in a higher state of tune where it develops  With the discontinuation of the S8 5.2 FSI after the 2009 model year and the RS 6 5.0 TFSI in late 2010, the S6 5.2 FSI and R8 5.2 FSI were the remaining Audi vehicles that have V10 engines. The S6 5.2 FSI was discontinued after the 2011 model year, shortly before the release of the 2012 Audi A6 (C7).
