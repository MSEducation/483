James M. Edie (November 3, 1927 – February 21, 1998) was a twentieth-century American philosopher.

Life and career

Edie was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota.  He studied at Saint John's University in Minnesota and at the Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm  in Rome before obtaining his doctorate in philosophy from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium.
Over his career, Edie became an important figure in the publicizing and development of phenomenology in North America.  He first taught philosophy for two years at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York.  In 1961 Edie relocated to Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he remained until his retirement, serving as Chair of the Philosophy Department from 1970 to 1977.  In 1962, along with  John Daniel Wild, William A. Earle, and others, he founded the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP). and was a member of the Executive Committee of The International Association for Philosophy and Literature for five years.
Edie was fluent in at least six languages.  He authored, co-authored, and edited a large corpus of academic papers and books during his career and, through his translations, introduced English readers to important works of contemporary continental philosophy.
