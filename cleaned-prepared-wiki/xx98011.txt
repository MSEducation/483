Early life

An only child,
He followed in the footsteps of his father and two uncles in playing hockey at Clarkson University for the Golden Knights.
The Golden Knights made Conroy a co-captain in his senior year of 1993–94. His Clarkson jersey (#7) was retired in a ceremony prior to a game against College of Holy Cross on October 20, 2012 in which he and his family attended.

Professional career

Montreal and St. Louis

Conroy was selected in the sixth round, 123rd overall, at the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the Montreal Canadiens. He turned professional in 1994 upon completing his college career in Clarkson.  At his first day of his first training camp with Montreal, he got into a fight with the team's star goaltender, Patrick Roy, after striking the latter with a slap shot in practice. He spent the majority of the 1994–95 season in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Fredericton Canadiens, scoring 26 goals and 44 points in 55 games. He appeared in six games for Montreal that year.  He played his first NHL game on February 15, 1995, against the Hartford Whalers, and scored his first goal one night later against the New York Rangers.  Though he was an offensive star at Clarkson and Fredericton, the Canadiens sought to convert him to a defensive specialist in the NHL.
While he averaged over one point per game with Fredericton in 1995–96, Conroy again played only a handful of games with Montreal. He again began 1996–97 in the AHL, but was traded along with Pierre Turgeon and Rory Fitzpatrick to the St. Louis Blues for Murray Baron, Shayne Corson and a draft pick on October 29, 1996. Conroy appeared in five games with the Worcester IceCats in the AHL, but after earning a recall to St. Louis, established himself as a regular in the NHL and appeared in 61 games with the Blues that season.  Head coach Joel Quenneville worked to develop Conroy's abilities as a defensive forward and top faceoff specialist.  Conroy responded in 1997–98 by improving to 43 points and a career-high plus-minus rating of +20. In recognition of his season, he was named a finalist for both the Selke Trophy as the NHL's top defensive forward, and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as its most gentlemanly player.
Conroy remained one of the league's top defensive forwards in 1998–99. While he missed several games with a high ankle sprain, He finished the season with just 27 points. 
Looking to improve their team for a playoff run in 2000–01, the Blues dealt Conroy, along with a draft pick, to the Flames for Cory Stillman.

Calgary and Los Angeles

Opinion of the deal shifted considerably the following season as Conroy established himself as the Flames' first line center alongside Jarome Iginla. The Flames named him a co-captain along with Bob Boughner late in the 2001–02 season, and he held the role full-time in 2002–03.
Conroy was the Flames second-leading scorer in 2002–03 with 59 points and again in 2003–04 when he scored 47 points despite missing 19 games with a knee injury. Shortly before the 2003-04 season began, Conroy gave up the captaincy after having decided it was time for Iginla to take over leadership of the team. but appeared in only two games for the team.
Conroy left the Flames as a free agent following the playoff run as he opted to sign a four-year, US$12 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings. The lockout wiped out the first year of the deal, but he returned in 2005–06 to reach the 20 goal mark for the third time and 60 points for the second time in his career. During that season, he joined the United States national team for a second time, playing in the 2006 Winter Olympics. He appeared in six games, scoring one goal and five points for the eighth place Americans.
Conroy struggled under new coach Marc Crawford early in the 2006–07 season, falling to five goals and sixteen points in 52 games for the Kings before he was traded back to the Flames on January 29, 2007, in exchange for Jamie Lundmark and two draft picks. Conroy finished the season by scoring 21 points in 28 games for Calgary, then scored 34 points in 2007–08.
The Flames re-signed Conroy to a new contract prior to the 2008–09 season and named him an alternate captain. At 39-years-old, Conroy played his 1,000th NHL game, against the Colorado Avalanche, on October 28, 2010. Only Grant Ledyard was older (age 40) when he reached that milestone.
Conroy played only nine more games after passing the milestone, and last played on December 20 against the Minnesota Wild. A healthy scratch in 32 of 50 games, and 28 of his final 29, Conroy was waived on January 25, 2011. After going unclaimed, he was left with the option of joining Calgary's AHL affiliate in Abbotsford or retiring.

Off the ice

Conroy has a wife, Jessie, and three daughters, Taylor, Sophia and Sydney. Conroy and his family chose to remain in Calgary following his retirement as a player, though they had considered other options including returning to his home town of Potsdam.
