The Venus Project organization advocates what founder Jacque Fresco calls a resource-based economy. The projected plan is to combine Fresco's versions of sustainable development, energy efficiency, natural resource management, and advanced automation in a global socioeconomic system based on social cooperation and scientific methodology. 
Located in Venus, Florida, the Venus Project is in a 21.5-acre (8.7-hectare) facility.

History

The Venus Project was founded in 1995 as a for-profit corporation by Jacque Fresco and Roxanne Meadows in Venus, Florida. 
A separate, nonprofit organization started by Fresco and his business partner Roxanne Meadows is Future By Design, founded in 2003.
Fresco lectures his ideas and gives tours of the Venus Project location.

Resource-based economy

The term "resource based economy" is used by the Venus Project to describe a hypothetical economic system in which goods, services, and information are free. Fresco argues that Earth has enough resources and that the practice of distributing resources through a price system method is irrelevant and counterproductive to survival.

The Zeitgeist Movement

The Venus Project concepts are outlined in the documentary-style film Zeitgeist: Addendum.
In 2011, the two groups ended their relationship. Speaking in an interview with London Real TV, Fresco cited personal differences between himself and Joseph, as well as lack of control over their collaborative efforts. He specifically noted his concern about the Zeitgeist Movement's professed role as the "activist arm" of the Venus Project, stating that Joseph "never consulted on what the activist arm would do."
