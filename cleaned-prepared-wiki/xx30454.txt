=Additional electrodes=

The classical 12-lead ECG can be extended in a number of ways in an attempt to improve its sensitivity in detecting myocardial infarction involving territories not normally "seen" well. This includes an rV4 lead, which uses the equivalent landmarks to the V4 but on the right side of the chest wall (used in paediatric patients under 5 years of age due to the dominance of the right ventricle in this age group) and extending the chest leads onto the back with a V7, V8 and V9.
The Lewis lead or S5 has the LA electrode placed in the second intercostal space to the right of the sternum with the RA at the fourth intercostal space. It is read as lead I and is supposed to demonstrate atrial activity much better to aid in identification of atrial flutter or broad-complex tachycardia.
A posterior ECG can aid in the diagnosis of a posterior myocardial infarction. This is performed by the addition of leads V7, V8 and V9 extending around the left chest wall toward the back.

Limb leads

In both the 5- and 12-lead configurations, leads I, II and III are called limb leads. The electrodes that form these signals are located on the limbs—one on each arm and one on the left leg.
Simplified electrocardiograph sensors designed for teaching purposes, e.g. at high-school level, are in general limited to three arm electrodes serving similar purposes.e.g. Pasco Pasport EKG Sensor PS-2111, Sciencescope ECG Sensor, etc.

Unipolar vs. bipolar leads

The two types of leads are unipolar and bipolar.  Bipolar leads have one positive and one negative pole. Cuesta College Home Page  In a 12-lead ECG, the limb leads (I, II and III) are bipolar leads.  Unipolar leads also have two poles, as a voltage is measured; however, the negative pole is a composite pole (Wilson's central terminal, or WCT) made up of signals from multiple other electrodes.  In a 12-lead ECG, all leads except the limb leads are unipolar (aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6).
Wilson's central terminal VW is produced by connecting the electrodes RA, LA, and LL together, via a simple resistive network, to give an average potential across the body, which approximates the potential at infinity (i.e. zero):

Augmented limb leads

Leads aVR, aVL, and aVF are augmented limb leads (after their inventor Dr. Emanuel Goldberger known collectively as the Goldberger's leads). They are derived from the same three electrodes as leads I, II, and III. However, they view the heart from different angles (or vectors) because the negative electrode for these leads is a modification of Wilson's central terminal. This zeroes out the negative electrode and allows the positive electrode to become the "exploring electrode". This is possible because Einthoven's Law states that I + (−II) + III = 0. The equation can also be written I + III = II. It is written this way (instead of I − II + III = 0) because Einthoven reversed the polarity of lead II in Einthoven's triangle, possibly because he liked to view upright QRS complexes. Wilson's central terminal paved the way for the development of the augmented limb leads aVR, aVL, aVF and the precordial leads V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6.
The augmented limb leads aVR, aVL, and aVF are amplified in this way because the signal is too small to be useful when the negative electrode is Wilson's central terminal. Together with leads I, II, and III, augmented limb leads aVR, aVL, and aVF form the basis of the hexaxial reference system, which is used to calculate the heart's electrical axis in the frontal plane. The aVR, aVL, and aVF leads can also be represented using the I and II limb leads:

Precordial leads

The electrodes for the precordial leads (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6) are placed directly on the chest. Because of their close proximity to the heart, they do not require augmentation. Wilson's central terminal is used for the negative electrode, and these leads are considered to be unipolar (recall that Wilson's central terminal is the average of the three limb leads. This approximates common, or average, potential over the body). The precordial leads view the heart's electrical activity in the so-called horizontal plane. The heart's electrical axis in the horizontal plane is referred to as the Z axis.

Esophageal lead

→  lead story: Filtered esophageal left heart electrogram.
The filtered esophageal left heart electrogram is a semi-invasive method. This technique is able to provide additional marker from the left atrium and the left ventricle.
The filtered bipolar esophageal left atrial electrogram (LAE) recording, in combination with the surface ECG can be of advantage in all situations requiring doubtless recognition of the atrial activities. With this additional "left atrial marker channel" the atrial activities can easily be recognized even if they are superimposed by the QRS complex. Thus, LAE recording can be utilized, for example, to quickly differentiate tachycardias and extrasystolies and to diagnose DDD pacemaker malfunctions. As a special advantage in atrio-biventricular and conventional AV block pacing, the esophageal left atrial electrogram recoding enables measurement of interatrial conduction intervals, which are the major determinants of the optimal AV delays in VDD and DDD pacing.
Compared to the surface ECG, the filtered bipolar esophageal left ventricular electrogram allows a more direct determination of the extent of cardiac desynchronization in heart failure patients. Thus, the esophageal left ventricular conduction delay (LVCDE) could be used as an additional marker of interventricular dyssynchrony to justify implantation of biventricular pacing systems and to guide the positioning of the left ventricular electrode.
The recording of the esophageal left heart electrograms requires a bipolar esophageal electrode. For example, the TOslim (Osypka AG, Rheinfelden, Germany) can be used. It has to be applied perorally or transnasally either with or without any mild sedation. To eliminate artifacts in the esophageal left atrial electrogram and to improve the differentiation between the left atrial deflection and the ventricular complex, high-pass filtering is recommended. Best results can be obtained using Butterworth high-pass filter technique (for example: through the DC input of a standard ECG recorder in combination with the Rostockfilter (Osypka AG, Rheinfelden, Germany) or by using the esophageal electrogram option of the Biotronik ICS 3000 programmer. In this case, no further equipment is needed.

Waves and intervals

A typical ECG tracing of the cardiac cycle (heartbeat) consists of a P wave, a QRS complex, a T wave, and a U wave, which is normally invisible in 50 to 75% of ECGs because it is hidden by the T wave and upcoming new P wave.A movie by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute explaining the connection between an ECG and the electricity in heart: What Is the Heart? The baseline of the electrocardiogram (the flat horizontal segments) is measured as the portion of the tracing following the T wave and preceding the next P wave and the segment between the P wave and the following QRS complex (PR segment). In a normal healthy heart, the baseline is equivalent to the isoelectric line (0 mV) and represents the periods in the cardiac cycle when there are no currents towards either the positive or negative ends of the ECG leads. However, in a diseased heart, the baseline may be depressed (e.g., cardiac ischaemia) or elevated (e.g., myocardial infarction) relative to the isoelectric line due to injury currents during the TP and PR intervals when the ventricles are at rest. The ST segment typically remains close to the isoelectric line as this is the period when the ventricles are fully depolarised and thus no currents can be in the ECG leads. Since most ECG recordings do not indicate where the 0 mV line is, baseline depression often gives the appearance of an elevation of the ST segment and conversely baseline elevation gives the appearance of depression of the ST segment.
Originally, four deflections were noted, but after the mathematical correction for artifacts introduced by early amplifiers, a fifth deflection was discovered. Einthoven chose the letters P, Q, R, S, and T to identify the tracing that was superimposed over the uncorrected labeled A, B, C, and D.
In intracardiac electrocardiograms, such as can be acquired from pacemaker sensors, an additional wave can be seen, the H deflection, which reflects the depolarization of the bundle of His.H deflection. thefreedictionary. 2009 The H-V interval, in turn, is the duration from the beginning of the H deflection to the earliest onset of ventricular depolarization recorded in any lead.H-V interval. thefreedictionary. 2002

Vectors and views

Interpretation of the ECG relies on the idea that different leads (meaning the ECG leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF and the chest leads) "view" the heart from different angles.
This has two benefits. First, leads that are showing problems (for example ST segment elevation) can be used to infer which region of the heart is affected. Second, the overall direction of travel of the wave of depolarisation can also be inferred, which can reveal other problems. This is termed the cardiac axis . Determination of the cardiac axis relies on the concept of a vector, which describes the motion of the depolarisation wave. This vector can then be described in terms of its components in relation to the direction of the lead considered. One component will be in the direction of the lead and this will be revealed in the behaviour of the QRS complex and one component will be at 90° to this (which will not). Any net positive deflection of the QRS complex (i.e., height of the R-wave minus depth of the S-wave) suggests the wave of depolarisation is spreading through the heart in a direction that has some component (of the vector) in the same direction as the lead in question.

Axis

The heart's electrical axis refers to the general direction of the heart's depolarization wavefront (or mean electrical vector) in the frontal plane. With a healthy conducting system, the cardiac axis is related to where the major muscle bulk of the heart lies. Under normal circumstances, this is the left ventricle, with some contribution from the right ventricle. It is usually oriented in a right shoulder to left leg direction, which corresponds to the left inferior quadrant of the hexaxial reference system, although −30° to +90° is considered to be normal.  If the left ventricle increases its activity or bulk, then there is said to be "left axis deviation" as the axis swings around to the left beyond −30°; however, in conditions wherein the right ventricle is strained or hypertrophied, then the axis swings around beyond +90° and "right axis deviation" is said to exist. Disorders of the conduction system of the heart can disturb the electrical axis without necessarily reflecting changes in muscle bulk.
In the setting of right bundle branch block, right or left axis deviation may indicate bifascicular block.

Lead groups

Of the 12 leads in total, each records the electrical activity of the heart from a different perspective, which also correlates to different anatomical areas of the heart for the purpose of identifying acute coronary ischemia or injury. Two leads that look at neighbouring anatomical areas of the heart are said to be contiguous. The relevance of this is in determining whether an abnormality on the ECG is likely to represent true disease or a spurious finding.
In addition, any two precordial leads next to one another are considered to be contiguous. For example, though V4 is an anterior lead and V5 is a lateral lead, they are contiguous because they are next to one another. A common saying to remember the contiguous leads is "I see all leads" (inferior, septal, anterior and lateral).
Lead aVR offers no specific view of the left ventricle. Rather, it views the inside of the endocardial wall to the surface of the right atrium, from its perspective on the right shoulder.

Filter selection

Modern ECG monitors offer multiple filters for signal processing. The most common settings are monitor mode and diagnostic mode. In monitor mode, the low-frequency filter (also called the high-pass filter because signals above the threshold are allowed to pass) is set at either 0.5 Hz or 1 Hz and the high-frequency filter (also called the low-pass filter because signals below the threshold are allowed to pass) is set at 40 Hz. This limits artifacts for routine cardiac rhythm monitoring. The high-pass filter helps reduce wandering baseline and the low-pass filter helps reduce 50- or 60-Hz power line noise (the power line network frequency differs between 50 and 60 Hz in different countries). In diagnostic mode, the high-pass filter is set at 0.05 Hz, which allows accurate ST segments to be recorded. The low-pass filter is set to 40, 100, or 150 Hz. As a consequence, the monitor mode ECG display is more filtered than diagnostic mode, because its passband is narrower." p. 130. New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1998. ISBN 0-443-08891-8.

Electrocardiogram heterogeneity

ECG heterogeneity is a measurement of the amount of variance between one ECG waveform and the next. This heterogeneity can be measured by placing multiple ECG electrodes on the chest and then computing the variance in waveform morphology across the signals obtained from these electrodes. Recent research suggests ECG heterogeneity often precedes dangerous cardiac arrhythmias.
In the future, implantable devices may be programmed to measure and track heterogeneity. These devices have potential to help ward off arrhythmias by stimulating nerves such as the vagus nerve, delivering drugs such as beta-blockers and, if necessary, defibrillating the heart.Dynamic Tracking of ECG Heterogeneity to Estimate Risk of Life-threatening Arrhythmias. CIMIT Forum. September 25, 2007.

Rhythm strip

Although multiple leads, and thus multiple electrical vectors, are commonly used in unison to gain diagnostic and therapeutic insight into cardiac status, monitoring one lead, referred to as a rhythm strip, can be useful to trend cardiac function in terms of heart rate, regularity, pauses, and basic rhythm.

History

The etymology of the word is derived from the Greek electro, because it is related to electrical activity, kardio, Greek for heart, and graph, a Greek root meaning "to write".
Alexander Muirhead is reported to have attached wires to a feverish patient's wrist to obtain a record of the patient's heartbeat while studying for his Doctor of Science (in electricity) in 1872 at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Birse,rev. Patricia E. Knowlden Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 2004 (Subscription required) – (original source is his biography written by his wife – Elizabeth Muirhead. Alexandernn Muirhead 1848–1920. Oxford, Blackwell: privately printed 1926.) This activity was directly recorded and visualized using a Lippmann capillary electrometer by the British physiologist John Burdon Sanderson. His electrocardiograph machine consisted of a Lippmann capillary electrometer fixed to a projector. The trace from the heartbeat was projected onto a photographic plate that was itself fixed to a toy train. This allowed a heartbeat to be recorded in real time. In 1911 he still saw little clinical application for his work.
An initial breakthrough came when Willem Einthoven, working in Leiden, the Netherlands, used the string galvanometer he invented in 1901. Rather than using today's self-adhesive electrodes Einthoven's subjects would immerse each of their limbs into containers of salt solutions from which the EKG was recorded.
Einthoven assigned the letters P, Q, R, S, and T to the various deflections,
Though the basic principles of that era are still in use today, many advances in electrocardiography have been made over the years. The instrumentation, for example, has evolved from a cumbersome laboratory apparatus to compact electronic systems that often include computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram.

Fetal electrocardiography

 According to a Cochrane review, monitoring the fetus using ECG plus cardiotocography (CTG) resulted in fewer instances of fetal scalp blood testing and less surgical assistance with the birth, compared to CTG alone. There was no difference in the number of Caesarean deliveries and little to suggest the babies were in better condition at birth.
