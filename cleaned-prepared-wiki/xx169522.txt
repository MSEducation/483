Nash said that although he was in love with Nivea, his lack of experience in a family growing up meant he was "not taught how much more than love takes to run a relationship. Like, 'cause love isn't just where it's gonna end. It can't start and stop with love. There has to be a certain amount of knowledge and patience that's acquired in order to keep it going and keep it straight, and I found out the hard way." Their divorce was finalized on June 15, 2008.
Nash began dating Christina Milian in early 2009 and she became pregnant. The Daily Mail reported that "the pregnancy was a surprise, but they were getting married regardless." Their divorce was finalized on October 23, 2011.com/entertainment/christina-milian-and-dream-divorce-finalized-photos
