Community involvement

Unite El Paso

In 1992, Senator Shapleigh joined with hundreds of other progressive El Paso civic leaders to found Unite El Paso.  This group of emerging leaders wanted to improve the per capita income in El Paso and create a viable economic model for future growth.  From the 1950s, when El Paso's per capita income levels were 20 percent higher than the Texas average, El Paso's per capita income level began a steep decline.  By 2000, levels had fallen to 30 percent below the state average.
Unite El Paso successfully identified major new initiatives to reverse this decline and create a consensus vision for a new, more prosperous El Paso.  To launch that vision as one of several initiatives, the group defined a goal of a new four-year medical school as the anchor of a Medical Center of the Americas.

Court of Inquiry

In 1994, Senator Shapleigh, at the request of Judge Edward Marquez of the 65th District Court, was sworn in as an ad litem for the El Paso Court of Inquiry.  Several prominent El Paso lawyers joined Judge Marquez to investigate whether the constitutional rights of the citizens of El Paso had been denied due to historically inadequate funding in the areas of transportation, mental health, and nutrition.

Senator Shapleigh is dedicated to increasing equity in state funding, ensuring fairness in state taxation, expanding educational opportunities for minority and low-income students, and developing community solutions for health, safety, and environmental issues.

In June 2009, Senator Shapleigh completed his seventh session as a legislator. During his tenure as a state Senator, he has authored more than 600 bills, with particular focus on education, economic development, infrastructure, technology, veteran, and health care issues.

El Paso Economic Summit

As a result of the Unite El Paso movement, Senator Shapleigh organized the 1998 El Paso Economic Summit, along with civic leaders such as Woody Hunt, UTEP President Diana Natalicio, and Mayor Carlos Ramirez.  Hundreds assembled at UTEP to describe a communitywide effort to build capacity for higher wage jobs in El Paso.  At that gathering, the number one goal for El Paso's future was identified as establishing a four-year medical school as the anchor of a joint institution Medical Center of the Americas.
Soon thereafter, Senator Shapleigh, County Attorney Jos√© Rodriguez, Woody Hunt, Robert Brown, John Montford, and others joined in discussions about how best to establish the medical school and which institution should carry the mission forward.  As a result, the Texas Tech University System Board of Regents made establishing a four-year medical school in El Paso an important goal of the System.  Over the coming legislative sessions, incremental progress was made in establishing the state's ninth medical school and first since 1977.  The school also is the only four-year medical school on the United States/Mexico border.

The summer program began in 1998 and operates under Community Scholars, Inc., a grass roots nonprofit corporation.

The Texas Eleven

Senator Shapleigh was one of the Texas Eleven, a group of Democratic Texas State Senators who broke quorum and removed to New Mexico for 46 days in 2003 in a quorum-busting effort aimed at preventing the passage of controversial re-redistricting legislation, spearheaded by then Congressional House Majority leader Tom DeLay, that would have benefited Texas Republicans.
Eventually the Texas Eleven was vindicated by the United States Supreme Court through its rulings that the re-districting could be considered gerrymandering and did bear unconstitutional elements.

ASARCO

Senator Shapleigh led the opposition to the reopening of an ASARCO-operated copper smelter located near downtown El Paso since 1887.  The smelter, which had been shut down in 1999 due to low copper prices, filed to renew their air permit application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality in 2002.  Joined by leaders
