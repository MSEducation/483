[[Carbon suboxide]]

CATEGORIES: Oxocarbons

Carbon suboxide, or tricarbon dioxide, is an oxide of carbon with chemical formula C3O2  or O=C=C=C=O.  Its four cumulative double bonds make it a cumulene. It is one of the stable members of the series of linear oxocarbons O=Cn=O, which also includes carbon dioxide (CO2) and pentacarbon dioxide (C5O2).
The substance was discovered in 1873 by Benjamin Brodie by subjecting carbon monoxide to an electric current. He claimed that the product was part of a series of "oxycarbons" with formulas Cx+1Ox, namely C, C2O, C3O2, C4O3, C5O4, ..., and to have identified the last two;
[/ref]  Otto Diels later stated that the more organic names dicarbonyl methane and dioxallene were also correct.
It is commonly described as an oily liquid or gas at room temperature with an extremely noxious odor.

Synthesis

It is synthesized by warming a dry mixture of phosphorus pentoxide (P4O10) and malonic acid or the esters of malonic acid.
Therefore, it can be also considered as the anhydride of malonic anhydride, i.e. the "second anhydride" of malonic acid. Malonic anhydride (not to be confused with maleic anhydride) is a real molecule.
Several other ways for synthesis and reactions of carbon suboxide can be found in a review from 1930 by Reyerson.
Carbon suboxide polymerizes spontaneously to a red, yellow, or black solid. The structure is postulated to be poly(α-pyronic), similar to the structure in 2-pyrone (α-pyrone).
In 1969, it was hypothesized that the color of Martian surface was caused by this compound; this was disproved by the Viking Mars probes.

Uses

Carbon suboxide is used in the preparation of malonates; and as an auxiliary to improve the dye affinity of furs.
