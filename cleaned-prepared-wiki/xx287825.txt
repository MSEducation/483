[[2013–14 Irish Cup]]

CATEGORIES: Irish Cup seasons, 2013–14 in Northern Ireland football, 2013–14 domestic association football cups

The 2013–14 Irish Cup is the 134th edition of the premier knock-out cup competition in Northern Irish football since its introduction in 1881. The competition began on 7 September 2013 with the first round and will end on 3 May 2014 with the final.
Glentoran were the defending champions, following their 3–1 win over Cliftonville after extra time in the 2012–13 final. However, they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Glenavon. The winners will qualify for the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round.

Format

119 clubs entered this season's competition, the same number that had taken part the previous season. Originally there had been 122 entrants, but three clubs later withdrew from the competition before the first round matches had been played.
Regional league clubs from level 4 and below on the Northern Ireland football league system entered in the first round and played against other regional league clubs in the first three rounds. Nine clubs were given a bye into the second round this season, necessitated by the number of participants. One of the clubs to receive a bye later withdrew. 29 of the 30 NIFL Championship clubs entered the competition, with Donegal Celtic being the only absentee. The 29 Championship clubs entered in the fourth round, along with the 11 lower league clubs that made it through the first three rounds.
The 12 NIFL Premiership clubs entered in the fifth round, along with the 20 winners from the fourth round matches. Replays were only used if a tie was level after 90 minutes in the fifth round, sixth round and quarter-finals. If a tie in any of these three rounds was still level after 90 minutes of the replay, extra time was used to determine the winner, with a penalty shoot-out to follow if necessary.
† One match was not played (walkover)

First round

The draw for the first round was made on 12 August 2013 with the matches played on 7 September 2013.
Ards Rangers, Albert Foundry, Ballywalter Recreation, Barn United, Dungiven Celtic, Oxford Sunnyside, Shorts and Strabane Athletic all received byes into the second round. Bangor Rangers, Holywood and Raceview were included in the original draw, but all three clubs withdrew before the first round matches were played. Bangor Rangers had received a bye, Holywood were drawn against Strabane Athletic, and Raceview were drawn against Ards Rangers. As a consequence, Ards Rangers and Strabane Athletic received byes, but Bangor Rangers' withdrawal meant that there would be an odd number of teams proceeding to the second round, necessitating a further bye at that stage.
