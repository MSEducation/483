Neve Shalom (

History

The name Neve shalom is taken from a passage in the .
The village was the brainchild of Bruno Hussar. Born in Egypt the son of non-practicing Jews, he converted to Christianity while studying engineering in France. Witnessing at first hand the vitriolic anti-semitism of wartime France sharpened his awareness of his Jewish roots..
Hussar's project envisaged the creation of a sociocultural framework that would enable residents to live on terms of equality and mutual respect while conserving the distinct cultural heritage, language and sense of identity each individual brought to the community from the complex mosaic of Palestine's historic communities. At the same time, it would be designed to function as a school of peace where people from all over the country could learn to listen to each other..
In Hussar's own words:
 "We had in mind a small village composed of inhabitants from different communities in the country.  Jews, Christians and Muslims would live there in peace, each one faithful to his own faith and traditions, while respecting those of others.  Each would find in this diversity a source of personal enrichment.". 
Conditions were harsh, and at first Hussar lived in a bus on the site. Even basic facilities like a bathroom were lacking, and showers could be taken only by driving once a week the 10 kilometres to kibbutz Nachshon.. The Neve Shalom-Wahat as-Salam model earned the 1989 Beyond War Award,Beyond War Award Page 
For years it survived as an orphan community devoid of official assistance. In 1994, after lobbying by foreign  supporters and the American diplomat Samuel W. Lewis, the Israeli government had a change of heart and began to provide subsidies, and extended legal status to the village as a municipality. As a result it earned autonomous zoning rights..
While assimilation is not promoted, intermarriage is not disapproved of, though instances are rare. The preference is for each community to maintain its distinct identity.. One resident stated the issue in the following terms:
 The Neve Shalom/Wahat Al-Salam experience humanizes the conflict. The village has many difficulties but at least we are not being broken. We do  have personal squabbles as in any village, but we are living the conflict instead of fighting it.. 
To mark the advent of the new millennium, towards the end of the 1990s the Trappist monastery decided to hand over half.

Demographics

The village is home (as of 2010) to some sixty families. By principle, half of the inhabitants are Jewish Israelis, the rest are Muslim and Christian Palestinian Arabs. Another 300 Jewish and Palestinian Arab families remain on the waiting list for settlement in the community. A recently approved expansion plan will permit the village to grow in coming years by another 92 housing lots.  Since its founding, the village has had a regular rotation of international volunteers brought in to provide basic support functions at its various facilities.

Administrative structure

The community is run by a steering committee or secretariat which, like its subcommittees, is elected by an annual democratic vote. The head of the secretariat effectively serves as the mayor of the village. In addition there are several internal committees to run the various activities of the village. A numerical balance is consistently observed between Jewish and Palestinian Arab representatives. Rotation however is not observed, and since 1995 the village administrator has always been a Palestinian Arab. Jewish Classes in the village school each have both a Jewish and an Arab teacher, but this does not extend to the curriculum, where maths, for example, is taught to children in their respective native languages.. and Feuerverger, using the theories of Paolo Freire, illustrates that language issues refract problems of power.

Education

According to Grace Feuerverger, Neve Shalom/Wahat as-Salam's emancipatory education 'has become a global role model of intercultural harmony, of teaching and learning to live together in peace.'.
There are three educational institutions in the village;

Economy and culture

The village also has a small guest house, offering programs aimed at acquainting local or foreign groups with the village and its cultural context. On
June 22, 2006, Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters played a live concert at the village, attracting over 50,000 fans..

Incidents

On May 31, 2010, the village political council placed a sign outside the village decrying the deaths of several human rights activists during the Gaza flotilla raid and called for the lifting of the Gaza siege. The wording of the sign originally described the deaths as "murder", though this was subsequently changed to "killing", which emerged as better reflecting the village consensus.'Protesting the attack on the Freedom Flotilla,' at nsws.,31 May 2010. In June, Arutz Sheva, a newspaper close to religious Zionism, reported that a rift had broken out between the Jewish and Arab communities over this issue, the former reportedly defending the IDF's soldiers against flotilla radicals and calling for the release of Gilad Shalit.  It also reported that threats had been made to expel the Jewish residents from the village.. In response the community posted on its website a note to the effect that the initiative was undertaken and authorized democratically and came from both Jewish and Palestinian members of the village. In July of the same year the community organized a joint Jewish-Palestinian conference to address the broad issues of human rights in the area, which was attended by speakers ranging from Gideon Levy to Neve Gordon and Ziv Hadas, Executive Director for Physicians for Human Rights.'Joint Jewish-Palestinian Conference in Neve Shalom/Wahat al-Salam,' July 22, 2010.
On June 14, 2012 village residents were shocked by a price tag attack in which 14 of their vehicles had their tires punctured overnight and several were vandalized by having racist slogans painted on them..

Evaluations

The Neve Shalom project has drawn a wide range of evaluations: some hail its exemplary function as a regional model for co-existence, while others dismiss the experiment. In the Middle East Quarterly in 1998, Joseph Montville took it as 'encouraging evidence of a genuine, grass-roots peace process.' Documenting its extensive work in networking to teach and train students from schools and universities on both sides of the border, he cited it as an effective part of two-track diplomacy, while noting that both religious and secular extremists from both sides prefer no contact with the "other", and other Israelis, while not dismissive, regard it as a naïve, impractical fantasy. Edward Alexander, in reply, dismissed Mondville's positive assessment. Building bridges between Jews and Arabs for mutual understanding ignores the fact, he argues, that both are fully cognizant of each other, with Arabs denying Jewish sovereignty while Jews refuse to renounce it. Neve Shalom can only exist if Jews suppress their Zionism in an act of self-abasement similar to that of the 'trembling ghetto Jew', while Arabs observe the deference gleefully. Montville's evidence shows a case where a Jewish boy absorbed guilt in an act of 'prodigious sympathy' while his Palestinian counterpart exuded rage. What is forgotten, he concluded, is that 'it was not the Israeli occupation that led to Arab hatred, but Arab hatred and aggression that led to that occupation.'.
In a review of Grace Feuerverger's monograph, H. Svi Shapiro assesses Neve Shalom's aspirations to provide a civic achievement of citizens enjoying equal status and rights, and concludes that;
 Neve Shalom/Wahat Al-Salam provides no definitive solution to this conundrum.  It does allow us, however, to see how one group of courageous, idealistic, and thoughtful individuals is struggling to mediate the tensions inherent in this situation..
