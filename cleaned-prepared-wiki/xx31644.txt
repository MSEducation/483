The Mid-American Conference (MAC) is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I collegiate athletic conference with a membership base in the Great Lakes region that stretches from Western New York to Illinois.  Nine of the twelve full member schools are in Ohio and Michigan, with single members located in Illinois, Indiana and New York.  For football, the MAC participates in the NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision, with an affiliate member in Massachusetts.
The MAC is headquartered in the Public Square district in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, and has two members in the nearby Akron area.  The MAC has been referred to as the "Conference of Quarterbacks" because of the accomplishments of numerous former players in the National Football League.

History

The five charter members of the Mid-American Conference were Ohio University, Butler University, the University of Cincinnati, Wayne University (now Wayne State University), and Western Reserve University, one of the predecessors to today's Case Western Reserve University. Wayne University left after the first year. Miami University and Western Michigan University took the place of those charter members for the 1948 season. The MAC added the University of Toledo (1950), Kent State University (1951), and Bowling Green State University (1952).  The University of Cincinnati resigned its membership February 18, 1953, with an effective date of June 1, 1953.  Cincinnati's decision was based on a new requirement that at least 5 conference football games would have to be scheduled each season, University President Raymond Walters saying they "......." The Lima News, February 19, 1953
The membership was steady for the next two decades except for the addition of Marshall University in 1954 and the departure of Western Reserve in 1955.  The first major expansion since the 1950s took place in the mid-1970s with the addition of Central Michigan University and Eastern Michigan University in 1972 and Ball State University and Northern Illinois University in 1973.  NIU left after the 1985–86 season.  The University of Akron joined the conference in 1992. The conference became the largest in Division I-A with the re-admittance of Marshall and NIU and addition of the State University of New York at Buffalo's Bulls in 1997 and 1998, respectively. The University of Central Florida joined for football only in 2002, becoming the first football-only member in conference history. Marshall (a second time) and Central Florida (a non-football all-sports member in the Atlantic Sun Conference at the time) would leave after the 2004–05 academic year, both joining Conference USA in all sports.
In May 2005, the Temple Owls in Philadelphia signed a six-year contract with the MAC as a football-only school and began play in the East Division in 2007.
The Louisville Cardinals were a MAC affiliate for field hockey for a number of years when Louisville was a member of the Metro Conference and Conference USA, winning two MAC tourney titles in 2003 and 2004.
The Missouri State Bears, Evansville Purple Aces, and Southern Illinois Salukis participate in the MAC for men's swimming and diving. Missouri, Northern Iowa, and Old Dominion are wrestling affiliates. The Missouri State Bears are also an affiliate for field hockey.
The UMass Minutemen joined the MAC as a football-only member in July 2012. Meanwhile, Temple ended its affiliation with the MAC in football and joined the Big East for football in July 2012. Following the split of the Big East into football-sponsoring and non-football conferences in July 2013, Temple became a full member of the football-sponsoring portion, the American Athletic Conference, ending its membership in the Atlantic 10 at that time.

Nine schools have MAC affiliate membership status. On July 1, 2012, Temple joined the Big East Conference for football only (the school's other sports would join the Big East/American for 2013–14), and Massachusetts replaced Temple as a football-only member in the MAC East Division. On September 19, 2012, the MAC announced Missouri, Northern Iowa and Old Dominion would join as wrestling affiliates; as the Southeastern and Missouri Valley Conferences do not sponsor wrestling. Missouri and Northern Iowa participated only in the conference tournament in the 2012–13 school year, and began full conference play in 2013–14. Old Dominion did not begin MAC competition until 2013–14, when it left the Colonial Athletic Association (which had sponsored wrestling, but no longer does so) for Conference USA (which has never sponsored the sport).
On July 1, 2013, Florida Atlantic's men's soccer program moved with the rest of its athletic program to Conference USA, and Chicago State's men's tennis team followed the rest of its sports to the Western Athletic Conference.
The Sun Belt Conference announced on February 11, 2014 that it would reinstate men's soccer, a sport that it last sponsored in 1995, for the 2014 season. The Hartwick men's soccer team will leave the MAC to join the Sun Belt.
‡ = In early 2014, the MAC made the decision "... to move forward without multi-divisional institutions." The conference then informed Hartwick College that their contract as an affiliate member would not be renewed.
† = On March 26, 2014, UMASS announced that they would leave the MAC on the last day of the 2015 FBS football season..

Former members

Nicknames listed here reflect those used during each school's MAC tenure. Two schools have changed their nicknames since leaving the MAC—Central Florida dropped "Golden" from its nickname, becoming simply Knights, while Wayne State now uses Warriors. Western Reserve merged with Case Institute of Technology in 1967 to form today's Case Western Reserve University, with the athletic programs merging in 1971. With the athletic merger, Case Western abandoned the nicknames of both former institutions and adopted Spartans.
