WAEB-FM, commonly known as "B104", is a Top 40 (CHR) radio station located in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania, in the United States and owned by Clear Channel Communications.  WAEB-FM broadcasts at 104.1Â MHz FM.

History

WAEB-FM signed on in 1961, initially simulcasting the Top 40 format airing on 790 WAEB. In the late 60s, WAEB FM separated from WAEB and went through several formats before eventually becoming a country music station known as WXKW.
In April 1985, the station reverted to the WAEB call letters and switched to a Soft Adult Contemporary format, playing a small amount of adult standards artists initially as well as a few new songs. The station was known as "Light FM 104 WAEB-FM" and it was a "niche" format meant to compete with 100.7 WFMZ (which was easy listening at the time) and 96.1 WLEV (which was an automated/live assist "Hot AC.")
By the early part of 1986, WAEB FM had evolved to more of a mainstream adult contemporary format.  By the late part of 1986, the station was phasing out the "Light" name and became "104 AEB-FM", and the music mix changed to a "heavily dayparted" AC/CHR mix without the hype.
On January 26, 1987, the day known as when "the records went away", the station switched to a Contemporary Hit Radio format and became "The World's First Laser Hit Station"-"Laser 104.1 FM", aptly named because 90% percent of the music (when available) was played on CD. One remnant of the station's "Laser Days" was at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, where back in 1987, their "Colossus" steel roller coaster was renamed "The Laser" until it was moved in 2008. Legendary voice guy Mitch Craig was the voice of 104.1 in its Laser years.
In 1991, 104.1 gradually downplayed the "Laser" moniker and identified themselves as "104.1 WAEB-FM."  In September of that year, after "Hot 99.9 WHXT" in Easton switched to "Oldies 99.9 WODE", WAEB-FM's transition to "B" day was complete.  The station then became known as "The New B-104".
The station positioned itself as "The New B-104" through late 1992.  Brian James became the new voice guy.  By late 1992 the station started to play down the fact that they were "new" and then began positioning as the station that plays "10 songs in a row" and gives you "Everything You Need to Know" because of their emphasis on local news in the morning and afternoon, as well as traffic reports every 10 minutes.  Ken Matthews hosted the morning show and Chuck McGee did afternoon drive.  
By Spring 1996, B-104 was reimaged, most of the flame throwing CHR jingles from the 80's were dropped and Sean Caldwell became the new voice guy of B-104. The Retro 80's Buffet began at noon hosted originally by Jennifer Knight (now on 95.1 WAYV Atlantic City).   In late 1996 B-104 began broadcasting Open House Party with John Garabedian on Saturday nights, after it was dropped by Pottsville's WAVT 
(T-102).  By 1997 B 104 began playing a lot more "softer" songs during the day that a lot of other CHR's didn't play (like "Here in my Heart" by Chicago), to pick up listeners who felt displaced by the signing off of A/C 96.1 WLEV in July of 1997.   In late 1998 B-104 began using a new jingle package, and streaming on the web.  
In 2006, B 104 was re-imaged again, dropping Caldwell as the voice as well as the "10 in a row" slogan. Morning man Ken Matthews exited, and long time night guy Mike Kelly was moved to mornings, as the station then began to resemble other Clear Channel CHR's in markets around the country, a sound they still maintain today as a Mainstream CHR radio station.  Today B 104 is a Mainstream CHR that no longer "dayparts" their music.  B 104 relies heavily on syndicated product from their parent company Clear Channel, along with a Live, Local Morning show 
"Mike and Steph in the morning". 
B-104 featured the "Firecracker 500" every 4th of July weekend through 2003 with the number 1 song usually being the biggest hit on the station in the last year.
B-104 is a part of the I HEART RADIO network.  On Saturday October 20th 2012, B-104 dropped Open House Party on Saturday nights and replaced it with Clear Channel's Saturday Online with Romeo. 
B 104 is continually at the top of the 12+ ratings in the Lehigh Valley maintaning 10+ shares for almost the last 25 years.
B104's signal can be heard as far east as Clinton, NJ, as far west as Wyomissing, PA, as far north as Tamaqua, PA, and as far south as Doylestown, PA. The station's transmitter is located in Washington Twp. just south of Slatington on tower road.  Signal restrictions to 104.1 FM come from 103.9 in Philly, Wink 104 in Harrisburg, and Q 104.3 in New York City.

Signal Note

Because of B104's proximity to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania along I-81 and I-78, the signal collides with Wink 104's signal right around Reading, Pennsylvania.
