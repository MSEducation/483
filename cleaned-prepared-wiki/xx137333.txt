[[1994 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]]

The 1994 Kangaroo Tour was the last played in the conventional format, where the Australian side plays a number of matches against British and French clubs or provincial outfits, in additions to the Test matches. The outbreak of the Super League war meant that the next Kangaroo Tour, set for 1998, never eventuated; although shortened tours were staged in 2001 and 2003.
Australia continued its dominance, winning both Test series against Great Britain and France, suffering only one loss (against Great Britain in the First Test at Wembley, just as they had done in 1990), and remained undefeated against British club outfits in a streak stretching back to 1978.
The team was coached by Bob Fulton who was making his fourth Kangaroo Tour (1973 and 1978 as a player, the latter as captain, and 1990 as coach). Mal Meninga created history by becoming the first and so far only player to make four tours as a player. Fulton and Meninga also became the first pair to be the Coach and Captain on consecutive Kangaroo Tours.
Paul Sironen became just the fourth forward to be selected for three Kangaroo Tours, having previously toured in 1986 and 1990.
This was the last full strength Australian side to take the field until after the resolution of the Super League war.

British leg

The first match against Great Britain at London's Wembley Stadium featured pre-match entertainment by Cliff Richard.
The 1994 Ashes series again broke the record aggregate crowd for the series in Great Britain with 140,430 attending the three tests, beating the record of 133,684 set on the 1990 Kangaroo Tour.
During the tour, The Kangaroos played an international against Wales at Ninian Park in Cardiff on 30 October, though the game isn't regarded as a test match (Australia wore their non-test jumpers for the game). In the first meeting of the two nations since the 1982 Kangaroo tour, the Australian's ran in eight tries to one in a 46-4 win, played on a heavy ground and in driving rain in front of 8,729 fans. The match produced two dark spots. Welsh centre John Devereux suffered a badly broken jaw after he accidentally collided with Mal Meninga's left shoulder while attempting to tackle the Australian captain, and an all-in-brawl erupted after Kangaroos Second Rower Paul Sironen reacted to a high tackle from Welsh halfback Kevin Ellis on Kangaroo halfback Allan Langer.

The Ashes series

=1st Test=

The first test of the 1994 Kangaroo Tour was again played at London's Wembley Stadium, and attracted 57,034 fans, a record Test Match crowd in England.

Despite Great Britain's captain and halfback Shaun Edwards being sent-off midway through the first half for a high shot on Australian lock forward Bradley Clyde, the Lions put in yet another brilliant performance at Wembley and, as they had done in the first test of the 1990 Kangaroo Tour and defeated the Kangaroo's 8-4. Lions fullback Jonathan Davies put in a man of the match performance, including scoring a 50m solo try in the first half after being put into a gap by Denis Betts, Davies outpacing Australian fullback Brett Mullins to score in the corner. Davies was also a solid last line of defense, repelling many breaks by the Kangaroos, until a dislocated shoulder midway through the second half saw him leave the field and eventually ruled him out for the rest of the series.

=2nd Test=

With Lions captain Shaun Edwards out suspended for his high tackle on Bradley Clyde in the first test, the captaincy was handed to his Wigan team mate Phil Clarke. 

In defense of The Ashes, the Kangaroos came out firing, scoring seven tries to one, kick started by captain Mal Meninga's 70m intercept run off a Bobby Goulding pass. Meninga put Andrew Ettingshausen in for his 10th try of the tour with a perfectly timed pass just as flying Lions winger Martin Offiah was about to tackle him. Rod Wishart made a welcome return to the test team for the first time since the 10-33 loss to the Lions in Melbourne in the 2nd test of the 1992 Ashes series, his goal kicking proving invaluable, kicking 7 goals from 9 attempts.
