History

Seeking a domestic aircraft manufacturer, the Brazilian government made several investments in this area during the 1940sRishikesha T. Krishnan. "Where core competence soars". Businessline. Chennai: October 1, 2003. p. 1 and '50s,OECD Territorial Reviews Madrid, Spain. p. 157/264 OECD Publishing. 2007. but it was not until 1969 that Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Embraer) was created as a government-owned corporation.Timeline Embraer Historical Center (Official site)
The company's first product was a turboprop transport, the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante.

Early growth

The Brazilian Government contributed to Embraer's early growth by providing license production contracts.
While military aircraft made up the majority of Embraer's products during the 1970s, by 1985 a regional airliner had debuted, the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia.net Aimed at the export market, this plane marked the first of Embraer's highly successful small airliners.

License-built Pipers

In 1974 the company started to produce Piper Aircraft light planes under license.  But by 1978 most of the parts and components were being sourced locally. Between 1974 and 2000 nearly 2500 license-built Pipers were produced by Embraer.

Privatization

Born from a Brazilian government plan and having been state-run from the beginning, Embraer began a privatization process alongside many other state-controlled companies during the government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso.[ref]Brazil on Road Peddling State-Owned Enterprises; Edition

This privatization effort saw Embraer sold on December 7, 1994,Scielo: Os efeitos da privatização sobre o desempenho econômico e financeiro das empresas privatizadas (Portuguese) and helped it avoid a looming bankruptcy. The company continued to win government contracts.

Product line expansion: military, regional & executive

In the mid-1990s the company pursued a product line more focused on small commercial planes than the military aircraft that had previously made up the majority of its manufacturing. Larger regional airliners with 70-110 seats and smaller business jets soon followed. Today the company manufactures for both defense and commerce.

Government subsidy controversy

Brazil and Canada engaged in an international, adjudicated trade dispute over government subsidies to domestic plane-makers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The World Trade Organization decided Brazil ran an illegal subsidy program, Proex, benefiting its national aviation industry from at least 1999-2000, and that Canada illegally subsidized its indigenous regional airliner industry, comprising Bombardier Aerospace.
