[[Euthanasia Prevention Coalition]]

CATEGORIES: Euthanasia

Euthanasia Prevention Coalition (EPC) is a non-profit organization that opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide in the world. It was founded by Alex Schadenberg, Dr. Barrie DeVeber and Jean Echlin in July 1998. Its headquarters are in London, Ontario, Canada.

Initiatives

In November 2012, the EPC started a project called "Declaration of Hope" with the help of another non-profit organization, HOPE Australia. The groups sent letters to all Canadian parliamentarians explaining why euthanasia and assisted suicide should not be legal, and the threats to society that would manifest if such a law were passed. Anyone can sign the online petition.
