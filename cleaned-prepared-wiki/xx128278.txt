Corey Sanders (March 7, 1975) is a professional boxer.  Originally hailing from Washington, DC, Corey has largely been a fringe contender in the heavyweight division. 
Known as "T-Rex", Sanders' most notable victory came in a shocking KO of respected Oleg Maskaev in 2002, which temporarily derailed Maskaev's plans of fighting for a title. His other notable opponents included Michael Grant, Andrew Golota, DaVarryl Williamson and Timo Hoffmann. 
Sanders gained widespread media attention in late 2006, when he fought a series of four round exhibition bouts against former undisputed heavyweight Mike Tyson during a world tour, which was organized to help pay off Tyson's financial debts. Tyson fought without headgear against the headgeared Sanders, and Tyson appeared to be holding back during the bouts to prevent an early end to the show.
He last fought in December 2007, dropping a six rounds decision to Dennis Bakhtov, which became his seventh loss in a row. His current professional record stands at 23 wins (15 KO), and 13 losses out of 36 fights.
