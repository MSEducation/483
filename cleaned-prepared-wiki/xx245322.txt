Rule 42 (now Rule 5.1 in the 2008 guide) is a rule of the Gaelic Athletic Association  (GAA) which in practice prohibits the playing of  non-Gaelic games in GAA stadiums. The rule is often mistakenly believed to prohibit foreign sports at GAA owned stadiums.  However, non-Gaelic games such as boxing and American football did take place in Croke Park before Rule 42 was modified.

The drive to have Rule 42 changed

In the early 2000s the GAA came under pressure to allow non-Gaelic games be played in Croke Park so that the Football Association of Ireland could be joint hosts of Euro 2008. 

When the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road is complete

Once the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road (now called the Aviva Stadium) is complete Rule 42 will revert to its 2005 wording.

Outside of Croke Park

In addition to the opening of Croke Park to competing sports, local GAA units have sought to rent their facilities out to other sports organisations for financial reasons in violation of Rule 42. The continued existence of Rule 42 has proven to be controversial since the management of Croke Park has been allowed to earn revenue by renting the facility out to competing sports organisations, but local GAA units which own smaller facilities cannot. It is also said that it is questionable as to whether or not such rental deals would actually be damaging to the GAA's interests.

Wording of the rule

The original wording of Rule 42 is:

The 2005 amendment added the sentence: 

The first games in Croke Park

The first game to take place under the relaxed Rule 42 took place on 11 February 2007.  It was a Six Nations Championship rugby union match between Ireland and France which Ireland lost 17–20.
There was a small protest by Republican Sinn Féin outside the ground.  Ireland won the match by 43 points to 13.

A world record attendance

In early February 2009, with possibility of an all Irish semi-final in the 2008-09 Heineken Cup, the GAA confirmed that club rugby would also be allowed under the relaxing of Rule 42.  The game was played in Croke Park on 2 May 2009, when Leinster defeated Munster 25–6. The attendance of 82,208 set a new world record attendance for a club rugby union game.
