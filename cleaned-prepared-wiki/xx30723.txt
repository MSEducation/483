[[Domestic long-haired cat]]

CATEGORIES: Cat landraces

A domestic long-haired cat is a cat of mixed ancestry – thus not belonging to any particular recognised cat breed – possessing a coat of semi-long to long fur. Gives a figure of 95% short-haired.  Other generic terms are long-haired house cat and, in British English, long-haired moggie.
In the cat fancy, and among veterinarians and animal control agencies, domestic long-haired cats cats may be classified with organisation-specific terminology, such as Domestic Longhair (DLH), House Cat, Longhair (HCL), PDF version:  While not bred as show cats, some mixed-breed cats are actually pedigreed and entered into cat shows that have non-purebred "Household Pet" divisions.  Show rules vary, and may permit "any eye colour, all coat colours and patterns, any coat length or texture, and any length of tail" (i.e. anything at all, as long as the cat is well-proportioned and healthy) or may be more restrictive, e.g.: "The colours chocolate and cinnamon, as well as their dilution (lilac and fawn) are not recognized in any combinations...
Domestic long-haireds come in all genetically possible cat colours including tabby, tortoiseshell, bi-coloured, and smoke. Domestic long-haireds can have fur that is up to six inches long. They can also have a mane similar to a Maine Coon's, as well as toe tufts and ear tufts. Some long-haired cats are not able to maintain their own coat, which must be frequently groomed by a human or may be prone to matting. Because of their wide gene pool, domestic long-haireds are not predisposed to any genetically inherited problems.

History
