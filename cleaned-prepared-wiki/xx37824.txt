History

Downieville was settled in late 1849 during the California Gold Rush and was first known as "The Forks" for its geographical location. It was shortly thereafter renamed after the town's founder, Major William Downie (1820-1893), a Scotsman who led an expedition of nine miners, including seven blacks,Quintard Taylor (1998), In Search of the Racial Frontier, New York/London: W.W. Norton & Company p.85 up the North Fork of the Yuba River and who was the town's first mayor. Major Downie's travels are documented in his 1893 autobiography, "Hunting for Gold." Downieville reached a peak population of over 5,000 people in 1851 but declined sharply by 1865. Downieville is situated at the confluence of the Downie River and North Fork of the Yuba River. Downieville was vying to become the state capital of California along with fifteen other California communities in 1853 before the capital was moved to Benicia, and then shortly thereafter its current location in Sacramento.  In July 1851 Downieville gained a distinction it may not have wanted when a mob lynching occurred on July 5. One particularly infamous crime was when a Mexican woman named Josefa Segovia was lynched by a mob in Downieville. She was accused of killing a white man who had attempted to assault her after breaking into her home. It remains the only lynching of a pregnant female in California history.
The northern mines area was populated by a number of gold rush camps with colorful names, places like Brandy City, Whiskey Diggins, Poverty Hill, and Poker Flat.  While many of these camps entirely disappeared after the gold rush, Downieville survived due both to its geographical location and status as the seat of Sierra County government.
