Covers

S.H.E's albums contain quite a number of cover songs. Among the group's 90 songs, 28 are covers. Earlier albums often included cover songs; however, since 2004, the group has recorded no more than two covers per album. In most covers, the songs' original titles were kept. Other songs, such as Westlife's "Soledad", were simply given new Chinese titles. The lyrics are usually rewritten, but some songs, such as Charlene's "I've Never Been To Me", are sung in their original English. While the musical style is usually maintained, some covers, such as "Only Lonely" and "I.O.I.O", have a lighter, bubblegum pop feel.
Older pieces and nursery rhymes are occasionally parodied. "Don't Wanna Grow Up" is a parody of Mozart's 40th Symphony, and "London Bridge is Falling Down" () are original compositions, but the chorus is borrowed from Mayday's "Gentle and Soft".

Criticism

Lack of originality

A review of S.H.E's 2005 album Once Upon a Time described the majority of the songs as "mundane", "predictable" and no better than "mushy pop standards", indicating that little has changed over their career.

Comparison with group Twins

In a 2004 review of female artists in Greater China, S.H.E was given an 80% approval rating, while archrivals Twins received a mere 50%.
