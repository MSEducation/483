[[Finite strain theory]]

In continuum mechanics, the finite strain theory—also called large strain theory, or large deformation theory—deals with deformations in which both rotations and strains are arbitrarily large, i.e. invalidates the assumptions inherent in infinitesimal strain theory.  In this case, the undeformed and deformed configurations of the continuum are significantly different and a clear distinction has to be made between them. This is commonly the case with elastomers, plastically-deforming materials and other fluids and biological soft tissue.

Displacement

The displacement of a body has two components: a rigid-body displacement and a deformation.
A change in the configuration of a continuum body can be described by a displacement field. A displacement field is a vector field of all displacement vectors for all particles in the body, which relates the deformed configuration with the undeformed configuration. Relative displacement between particles occurs if and only if deformation has occurred. If displacement occurs without deformation, then it is deemed a rigid-body displacement.

Material coordinates (Lagrangian description)

Expressed in terms of the material coordinates, the displacement field is:

Spatial coordinates (Eulerian description)

Expressed in terms of spatial coordinates, the displacement field is:

Combining the coordinate systems of deformed and undeformed configurations

Thus in material (deformed) coordinates, the displacement may be expressed as:
And in spatial (undeformed) coordinates, the displacement may be expressed as:

Time-derivative of the deformation gradient

Calculations that involve the time-dependent deformation of a body often require a time derivative of the deformation gradient to be calculated.  A geometrically consistent definition of such a derivative requires an excursion into differential geometryA. Yavari, J.E. Marsden, and M. Ortiz, On spatial and material covariant balance laws in elasticity, Journal of Mathematical Physics, 47, 2006, 042903; pp. 1-53. but we avoid those issues in this article.
Related quantities often used in continuum mechanics are the rate of deformation tensor and the spin tensor defined, respectively, as:
The rate of deformation tensor gives the rate of stretching of line elements while the spin tensor indicates the rate of rotation or vorticity of the motion.

Transformation of a surface and volume element

To transform quantities that are defined with respect to areas in a deformed configuration to those relative to areas in a reference configuration, and vice versa, we use Nanson's relation, expressed as
The corresponding formula for the transformation of the volume element is

Polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor

It can be shown that,

Deformation tensors

Several rotation-independent deformation tensors are used in mechanics.  In solid mechanics, the most popular of these are the right and left Cauchy-Green deformation tensors.

The Right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor

In 1839, George Green introduced a deformation tensor known as the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor or Green's deformation tensor,  defined as:The IUPAC recommends that this tensor be called the Cauchy strain tensor.

The Finger deformation tensor

The Left Cauchy-Green or Finger deformation tensor

Reversing the order of multiplication in the formula for the right Green-Cauchy deformation tensor leads to the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor which is defined as:
The left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor is often called the Finger deformation tensor, named after Josef Finger (1894). Dvorkin, Marcela B. Goldschmit, 2006 Nonlinear Continua, p. 25, Springer ISBN 3-540-24985-0.
For nearly incompressible materials, a slightly different set of invariants is used:

Derivatives of stretch

Derivatives of the stretch with respect to the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor are used to  derive the stress-strain relations of many solids, particularly hyperelastic materials.  These derivatives are

Finite strain tensors

The concept of strain is used to evaluate how much a given displacement differs locally from a rigid body displacement. One of such strains for large deformations is the Lagrangian finite strain tensor, also called the Green-Lagrangian strain tensor or Green – St-Venant strain tensor, defined as
or as a function of the displacement gradient tensor

Seth-Hill family of generalized strain tensors

B. R. Seth from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur was the first to show that the Green and Almansi strain tensors are special cases of a more general strain measure. The Seth-Hill family of strain measures can be expressed as

Stretch ratio

The stretch ratio is a measure of the extensional or normal strain of a differential line element, which can be defined at either the undeformed configuration or the deformed configuration.
This equation implies that the normal strain is zero, i.e. no deformation, when the stretch is equal to unity. Some materials, such as elastometers can sustain stretch ratios of 3 or 4 before they fail, whereas traditional engineering materials, such as concrete or steel, fail at much lower stretch ratios, perhaps of the order of 1.001 (reference?)

Physical interpretation of the finite strain tensor

Under certain circumstances, i.e. small displacements and small displacement rates, the components of the Lagrangian finite strain tensor may be approximated by the components of the infinitesimal strain tensor

Compatibility conditions

The problem of compatibility in continuum mechanics involves the determination of allowable single-valued continuous fields on bodies.  These allowable conditions leave the body without unphysical gaps or overlaps after a deformation.  Most such conditions apply to simply-connected bodies.  Additional conditions are required for the internal boundaries of multiply connected bodies.
