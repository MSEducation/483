[[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup]]

CATEGORIES: FIS Alpine Ski World Cup

The FIS Alpine Ski World Cup is the top international circuit of alpine skiing competitions, launched in 1966 by a group of ski racing friends and experts which included French journalist Serge Lang and the alpine ski team directors from France (Honore Bonnet) and the USA (Bob Beattie). Also available under ISBN 0-246-13116-0. It was soon backed by International Ski Federation (FIS) president Marc Hodler during the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1966 at Portillo, Chile, and became an official FIS event in the spring of 1967 after the FIS Congress at Beirut, Lebanon. The first World Cup ski race was held in Berchtesgaden, West Germany, on January 5, 1967.  Jean-Claude Killy of France and Nancy Greene of Canada were the overall winners for the first two seasons.
Competitors attempt to achieve the best time in four disciplines: slalom, giant slalom, Super G, and downhill. The fifth event, the combined, employs the downhill and slalom.  The World Cup originally included only slalom, giant slalom, and downhill races. Combined events (calculated using results from selected downhill and slalom races) were included starting with the 1974–75 season, while the Super G was added for the 1982–83 season.  The current scoring system was implemented in the 1991–92 season.  For every race points are awarded to the top 30 finishers: 100 points to the winner, 80 for second, 60 for third, winding down to 1 point for 30th place.  The racer with the most points at the end of the season in mid-March wins the Cup, with the trophy consisting of a 9 kilogram crystal globe.5 kg crystal globe.  (See the section on scoring system below for more information.) 
The World Cup is held annually, and is considered the premier competition for alpine ski racing after the quadrennial Winter Olympics. Many consider the World Cup to be a more valuable title than the Olympics or the biennial World Championships, since it requires a competitor to ski at an extremely high level in several disciplines throughout the season, and not just in one race.
Races are hosted primarily at ski resorts in the Alps in Europe, with regular stops in Scandinavia, North America, and east Asia, but a few races have also been held in the Southern Hemisphere. World Cup competitions have been hosted in 25 different countries around the world: Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. (Note that all World Cup races hosted at ski resorts in Bosnia and Slovakia were held when those countries were still part of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia respectively.)
Lower competitive circuits include the NorAm Cup in North America and the Europa Cup in Europe.

Crystal globe

Since 1967 big crystal globe is awarded for overall title. From beginning to 1976-77 discipline titles were awarded with medals. In statistics those titles has the same value as small crystal globe. 
For the first time small crystal globe for discipline titles in slalom, giant slalom and downhill appeared in 1977-78. 
In the super-G small crystal globe is awarded since 1985-86. For super-g races in previous three seasons points were added and calculated in giant slalom ranking. 
In combined small crystal globe was officially awarded only between 2007-2012. Before that combined season winners cannot officially be considered as season titles. In those years FIS simply calculated points from other two races, DH and SL.

Super Ranking

Best skiers of all-time in overall and each discipline based on ski-database ranking system (counting since 1966). This is a scoring system calculating points together from four categories: World Cup (overall and discipline titles and inidividual races), OG, SWC.

All-event winners

Only a few of the most versatile racers have ever managed to win races in all five World Cup alpine skiing disciplines during their career, as listed in the table below.  Marc Girardelli (1988–89), Petra Kronberger (1990–91), Janica Kostelić (2005–6) and Tina Maze (2012–13) are the only skiers to have won all five events in a single season. Of these, Tina Maze is the only one to have won five different events in a row within a single season (2012-13, between December 16 and March 2). Bode Miller is the only skier with at least five World Cup victories in all five disciplines. Since the combined was not introduced until the 1974–75 season and the Super G until 1982–83, the following list also includes those racers who won races in all disciplines contested during their World Cup careers (events not contested are marked by NA).

Men

Women

Michèle Jacot, the only female French alpine skiing World Cup overall winner (1970), would be part of this list, if only she had finished her career (1968–1975) one year earlier; from 1969–1971 she achieved 10 victories (1 downhill, 6 giant slaloms, 3 slaloms), but in her last season 1974–75 the combined was introduced, and she could not add a victory in this discipline.

Youngest and oldest World Cup winners

The youngest person ever to win a World Cup race is Christa Zechmeister of West Germany, who won a slalom in Val d'Isere, France, in December 1973 at the age of 16 years, 4 days. Several other women have also won World Cup races at age 16.
The youngest men's World Cup race winner is Piero Gros of Italy, who won a giant slalom in Val d'Isere, France, in December 1972 (one day before Pamela Behr's win) at the age of 18 years, 39 days. Gros would win a slalom race only nine days later, and go on to win 12 World Cup races during his ten-year career. Several other men have also won World Cup races at age 18.
The oldest person ever to win a World Cup race is Didier Cuche of Switzerland, who has won three downhills and a Super-G during the 2011–2012 season, most recently at Crans Montana, Switzerland in February 2012 at the age of 37 years, 192 days. No other men have won a World Cup race beyond the age of 36.
The oldest women's World Cup race winner is Michaela Dorfmeister of Austria, who won a Super G in Hafjell, Norway, in March 2006 at the age of 32 years, 343 days. Two of her Austrian teammates, Alexandra Meissnitzer and Anita Wachter, have also won World Cup races at age 32.
The youngest overall World Cup winner is Annemarie Moser-Pröll of Austria, who won the women's 1971 Alpine Skiing World Cup at the age of 17. She would go on to repeat as overall champion for the next four seasons (1972–1975), along with a 6th overall title in 1979. The youngest men's overall winner is Piero Gros of Italy, who won the men's 1974 Alpine Skiing World Cup at the age of 19 for his only overall title.
The oldest overall World Cup winner is Stephan Eberharter of Austria, who won the men's 2003 Alpine Skiing World Cup at the age of 33, his 2nd consecutive overall title. The oldest women's overall winner is Vreni Schneider of Switzerland, who won the women's 1995 Alpine Skiing World Cup at the age of 30 for her 3rd overall title.

World Cup scoring system

The World Cup scoring system is based on awarding a number of points for each place in a race, but the procedure for doing so and the often-arcane method used to calculate the annual champions has varied greatly over the years.  Originally, points were awarded only to the top 10 finishers in each race, with 25 points for the winner, 20 for second, 15 for third, 11 for fourth, 8 for fifth, 6 for sixth, 4 for seventh, and then decreasing by 1 point for each lower place.  To determine the winner for each discipline World Cup, only a racer's best 3 results would count, even though there would typically be 6–8 races in each discipline.  For the overall Cup, the best three results in each discipline would be summed. Until 1970, also the results of Winter Olympic Games races and Alpine World Ski Championship races were included in the World Cup valuation (i.e. Grenoble 1968 and Val Gardena 1970); this was abandoned after 1970, mainly due to the limited number of racers per nation who are admitted to take part in these events. For the 1971–72 season, the number of results counted was increased to 5 in each discipline. The formula used to determine the overall winner varied almost every year over the next decade, with some seasons divided into two portions with a fixed number of results in each period counting towards the overall, while in other seasons the best 3 or 4 results in each discipline would count.  
Starting with the 1979–80 season, points were awarded to the top 15 finishers in each race. After 1980–81, the formula for the overall title stabilized for several years, counting the best 5 results in the original disciplines (slalom, giant slalom, and downhill) plus the best 3 results in combined. When Super G events were introduced for the 1982–83 season, the results were included with giant slalom for the first three seasons, before a separate discipline Cup was awarded starting in 1985–86 and the top 3 Super G results were counted towards the overall.  The formula for the overall was changed yet again the following season, with the top 4 results in each discipline counting, along with all combined results (although the combined was nearly eliminated from the schedule, reduced to only 1 or 2 events per season).
This perennial tweaking of the scoring formula was a source of ongoing uncertainty to the World Cup racers and to fans.  The need for a complete overhaul of the scoring system had grown increasingly urgent with each successive year, and in 1987–88 the FIS decided to fully simplify the system: all results would now count in each discipline and in the overall.  This new system was an immediate success, and the practice of counting all results has been maintained in every subsequent season. With the ongoing expansion of the number and quality of competitors in World Cup races over the years, a major change to the scoring system was implemented in the 1991–92 season.  The top 30 finishers in each race would now earn points, with 100 for the winner, 80 for second, 60 for third, and then decreasing by smaller increments for each lower place.  The point values were adjusted slightly the following season (to reduce the points for places 4th through 20th), and the scoring system has not been changed again since that year. The table below compares the point values under all five scoring systems which have been in use:
† NOTE: The scoring system changed during the 1978–79 season; this special system was used for the last 2 men's downhills and the last 3 races in every other discipline except combined.

Statistical Analysis

Since the Top 30 scoring system was implemented in 1991–92., the number of completed men's or women's World Cup races each year has ranged from 30 to 44, so the maximum possible point total for an individual racer is about 3000–4400 under the current scoring system. However, very few racers actually ski in all events; for example, Bode Miller was "the only skier to have competed in every World Cup race" during the three seasons from 2003–2005.  The current record for total World Cup points in a season is Tina Maze's 2414 points in 2012–13, with the men's record of 2000 points set by Hermann Maier in 1999–2000. The fewest points for an overall champion under the current system thus far have been 1009 for men by Aksel Lund Svindal in 2008-9 and 1248 for women by Vreni Schneider in 1994–95.  The largest margin of victory in the overall has been Maze's 1313 points in 2012-13, more than doubling second place finisher Maria Höfl-Rieschs total, while the largest men's margin was 743 points by Hermann Maier in 2000-1. Note that in the early days of World Cup (when the first place was awarded only 25 points), even larger relative margins of victory were recorded in 1967 by Jean-Claude Killy with 225 points over Heinrich Messner with 114 points and in 1973–74 by Annemarie Moser-Pröll with 268 points over Monika Kaserer with 153 points. The closest finishes since 1992 have been minuscule margins of 6 points in 1994–95 (Vreni Schneider over Katja Seizinger), 3 points in 2004-5 (Anja Pärson over Janica Kostelić) and in 2010–11 (Maria Riesch over Lindsey Vonn), and only 2 points in 2008-9 (Aksel Lund Svindal over Benjamin Raich). The current men's record for total World Cup points in one month of the season is Ivica Kostelić's 999 points from January 2011.
The tables below contain a brief statistical analysis of the overall World Cup standings during the 21 seasons since the Top 30 scoring system was implemented in 1991–92.  In general, over 1000 points are needed to contend for the overall title.  At least 1 man and 1 woman has scored 1000 points in each of these seasons, but no more than 5 men's or women's racers have crossed that threshold in any single season.  Of the 42 men's and women's overall champions in these years, 38 scored over 1200 points, 30 had over 1300 points, 19 reached 1500 points, and only 7 amassed more than 1700 points during their winning seasons.  As for the runners-up, 37 of the 42 second-place finishers scored over 1000 points, 18 had over 1300 points, and only 4 reached 1500 points yet failed to win.  Most overall titles have been won quite convincingly, by more than 200 points in 23 of 42 cases, while only 11 margins of victory have been tighter than 50 points.

World Cup Finals

Since 1993 the International Ski Federation (FIS) has hosted a World Cup Final at the end of each season in March. During five days, men's and women's races are held in four disciplines: slalom, giant slalom, Super G, and downhill. Only a limited number of racers are invited to ski at the Finals, including the top 25 in the World Cup standings in each discipline, plus the current junior World Champions in each discipline. Because of the smaller field, World Cup points are only awarded to the top 15 finishers in each race.
Hosts of the World Cup Finals:
The 2004 final was held in all FIS disciplines except Ski Jumping. The Freestyle events were held in neighbouring Sauze d'Oulx and the Snowboard events in Bardonecchia.
The 2008 final was held in all FIS disciplines except Ski Jumping. The Freestyle and Snowboard events were held in neighbouring Valmalenco.

Parallel

Nations Cup/Exhibition

World Cup

NOTE: Only parallel events from (1975, 1997, 2011-2013) count in overall ranking are considered as individual World Cup victories. Other parallel events from (1976-1991, 2009) counted only for Nations Cup or were just show events.

Nations Cup

The Nations Cup standings are calculated by adding up all points each season for all racers from a given nation.  
The early years of the World Cup were largely dominated by the French ski team, as reflected in their Nations Cup wins in 5 of the first 6 years.  The Austrian team then took over throughout the rest of the 1970s, followed by Swiss superiority during most of the 1980s.  A resurgent Austrian team charged back to the top in 1990, beginning a long streak of consecutive Nations Cup triumphs.  Austrian dominance reached its zenith in the late 1990s and 2000s (decade), when their point total regularly doubled that of the second place finisher, and was capped in the 1999–2000 and 2003–4 seasons with totals that tripled those of runner-up Italy.  Their 17927 point total in 1999–2000 is a Nations Cup record, as is their 12066 point margin of victory in 2003–4.
As of the end of the 2011–12 season, the Austrian team has won 23 consecutive Nations Cups, while topping the men's standings for 20 straight years and the women's for 14 in a row.  Austria is the only nation to have finished in the top 3 of the Nations Cup standings in all 46 years in which World Cup competition has been held, winning in 33 of those years, runner-up in 12 years, and third place in a single year. In the midst of the ongoing Austrian juggernaut, the Swiss or Italian teams have usually held second place.  The German team reached the runner-up spot for the first time in 1997–8, as did the Norwegians the next season.  The US enjoyed its best placings ever starting in 2004–5, grabbing second in the Nations Cup for two straight years.  
Under the current scoring system (since 1992), the winning nation (Austria every year) has averaged over 13000 points, with an average of over 6400 for the runner-up, 5400 for third place, 4200 for fifth, and 1300 for tenth.  The all-inclusive scoring system (simply adding together all World Cup points earned) favors national teams with great depth and many racers scoring World Cup points, and even teams with several top racers have no realistic chance of breaking the Austrian grip on the top spot, while a team with only one or two top-ranked racers will struggle to ever break the top five in the standings.  There have been numerous calls for a revamped scoring system which would allow other nations to compete more readily for top spots in the Nations Cup, but no changes are likely to be made.
The total number of top-three placings for each nation in the Nations Cup (through the 2011–12 season) are summarized below:
NOTE: Results for West Germany and Germany are counted together in this table.

Nations which have won World Cup races

The table below lists those nations which have won at least one World Cup race (current as of March 16, 2014). 
Individual race wins are counted in this table, along with the nations team events held at World Cup Finals since 2006 (counts double as both men & women in mixed competition contribute to a win). The "parallel race" is a head-to-head slalom race format used occasionally from the 1970s through 1990s, and again in 2011. Team event wins are doubled (because on one team event race competed both women and men; so it's counted separately each for women and men). Results for West Germany and Germany are counted together in this table.  All of Yugoslavia's wins are currently lumped in with Slovenia, since the skiers who won races for former Yugoslavia were all Slovenes from Slovenia (one of six Yugoslav Republics), and thus are listed under Slovenia in online databases. The Soviet Union and Russia are counted separately, as are Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic.
A total of 24 countries have won World Cup races, with 19 different countries winning men's races and 20 winning women's races. As expected, the top 10 nations in this list are the same as the 10 nations listed in the Nations Cup summary table (with slight changes in order).
Some interesting facts can be found in the data: Marc Girardelli accounted for all of Luxembourg's 46 wins, while Janica Kostelić has 30 of Croatia's 56 and her brother Ivica has the rest. Ingemar Stenmark still has nearly one-half of Sweden's 192 wins more than two decades after his retirement. Some nations specialize in either speed (downhill and Super G) or technical (slalom and GS) disciplines, while others are strong across the board.  Among nations with 30+ wins, the Canadian team has won 73% of its races in speed events, while Yugoslavia/Slovenia has won 84% and Sweden 86% of their races in technical events, especially notable in Sweden's case given its large number of wins. Several nations with under 30 wins have 100% of them in technical events, led by Finland and Spain. In contrast Germany and Norway have the most even distribution without disproportionate strength or weakness in any one discipline. Some nations have strong teams in only one gender, as 92% of Norway's wins have come from their men and 83% of Germany's from their women, while the Swiss and Canadian totals are split almost equally.
