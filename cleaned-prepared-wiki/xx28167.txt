[[Semivowel]]

CATEGORIES: Vowels, Approximant consonants

In phonetics and phonology, a semivowel (or glide) is a sound, such as English 

Classification

Semivowels form a subclass of approximants.
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the diacritic attached to non-syllabic vowel letters is . Additionally, there are dedicated symbols for four semivowels that correspond to the four close cardinal vowel sounds:
The pharyngeal approximant .
In addition, some authors consider the rhotic approximants 

Contrast with vowels

Semivowels, by definition, contrast with vowels by being non-syllabic. In addition, they are usually shorter than vowels.  In languages as diverse as Amharic, Yoruba, and Zuni, semivowels are produced with a narrower constriction in the vocal tract than their corresponding vowels.   Nevertheless, semivowels may be phonemically equivalent with vowels.  For example, the English word fly can be considered either as an open syllable ending in a diphthong 
It is unusual for a language to contrast a semivowel and a diphthong containing an equivalent vowel,
Although a phonological parallel exists between 

Contrast with fricatives/spirant approximants

According to the standard definitions, semivowels (such as 
Again, this is not present in all dialects.  Other dialects differ in either merging the two or in enhancing the contrast by moving the former to another place of articulation (e.g. ).
