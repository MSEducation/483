History

Colonial

Albany County was created on November 1, 1683 by New York Governor Thomas Dongan, and later confirmed on October 1, 1691.
The city of Albany was the first municipality within this large county, as the village (dorp in Dutch) of Beverwyck by the Director-General of New Amsterdam, Pieter Stuyvesant, who also established the first court in Albany. Other districts established in 1772 were Hoosick, Coxsackie, Cambridge, Saratoga, Halfmoon, Kinderhook, Kings, Claverack, Great Imboght, and the Manor of Livingston.
In a census of 1697, there were 1,452 individuals living in Albany County, two years later it would be counted as 2,016 at the beginning of King William's War. By the end of the war in 1698  the population had dropped to 1,482, but rebounded quickly and was at 2,273 by 1703. By 1723, it had increased to 6,501 and in 1731 to 8,573, which was slightly less than the population within the city of New York in the same year. In 1737, the inhabitants of Albany County would outnumber those of New York County by 17 people. In 1774, Albany County, with 42,706 people, was the largest county in colonial New York. According to the first Federal Census in 1790, Albany County reached 75,921 inhabitants and was still the largest county in the state.

Formation of towns

On March 7, 1788, the state of New York divided the entire state into towns eliminating districts as administrative units by passing New York Laws of 1788, Chapters 63 and 64.

Timeline of boundary changes

Albany County was one of the original twelve counties created by the Province of New York on November 1, 1683.(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch 4/1:122) At that time it included all of the present Bennington County, Vermont, all of New York state north of the counties of Dutchess and Ulster, and theoretically stretched west to the Pacific Ocean., Editor: New York Atlas of Historical County Boundaries; The Newbury Library; 1993.
On May 27, 1717, Albany County was adjusted to gain an indefinite amount of land from Dutchess County and other non-county lands.(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch 333/1:915).
On October 7, 1763, King George III, as part of his Proclamation of 1763, created the new province of Quebec, implicitly setting the northern limit of New York at the parallel of 45 degrees north latitude from the Atlantic-St. Lawrence watershed westward to the St. Lawrence River, implicitly setting the northern limit of Albany County, but it was never mapped.(Cappon, Petchenik, and Long, 1, 77, 90; Shortt and Doughty, 119—120).
On July 20, 1764, King George III established the boundary between New Hampshire and New York along the west bank of the Connecticut River, north of Massachusetts and south of the parallel of 45 degrees north latitude. Albany County implicitly gained present-day Vermont. Although disputes occasionally broke out later, this line became the boundary between New Hampshire and Vermont, and has remained unchanged to the present. When New York refused to recognize land titles through the New Hampshire Grants (towns created earlier by New Hampshire in present Vermont), dissatisfied colonists organized in opposition, which led to the creation of independent Vermont in 1777.(Slade, 13—19; Van Zandt, 63).
On July 3, 1766, Cumberland County was partitioned from Albany County to cover all territory to the northern and eastern limits of the colony, including Windsor County, most of Windham County, and parts of Bennington and Rutland counties in present-day Vermont.(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1297/4:904).

On March 12, 1772, Albany County was partitioned again, this time into the counties of Albany, Tryon (now Montgomery), and Charlotte (now Washington). This established a definite area for Albany County of .(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1534/5:321).

On June 26, 1781, Bennington County, Vermont attempted to annex a portion of Albany County that today includes portions of Washington and Rensselaer counties to form what they called "The West Union".(Vt. State papers, 13:45–46). The fledgling United States – under the Articles of Confederation – arbitrated this annexation, and condemned it, resulting in Vermont ceasing the annexation on 1782-02-23.(Vt. State papers, vol 3, pt. 2; pp. 67–68).
On April 4, 1786, Columbia County was created from  of Albany County land.(N.Y. Laws 1786, 9th sess., ch. 28/p. 49).
On March 7, 1788, New York, refusing to recognize the independence of Vermont, and the attendant elimination of Cumberland County, attempted to adjust the line that separated Cumberland from Albany County in present-day Vermont, but to no effect.(N.Y. Laws 1788, 11th sess., ch. 63/pp. 746–747).
On February 7, 1791, Albany County was partitioned again, this time to form Rensselaer and Saratoga counties. Rensselaer received  changed hands.(N.Y. Laws 1791, 14th sess., ch. 4/p. 201).
On June 1, 1795, Albany County was once again partitioned, this time losing  to Schoharie County.(N.Y. Laws 1795, 18th sess., ch. 42/p. 588).
On April 5, 1798, another partition took place, with  passing to Ulster County.(N.Y. Laws 1798,21st sess., ch. 93/p. 273).
On March 25, 1800, once again Albany County was partitioned, with  being used to create Greene County.(N.Y. Laws 1800, 23rd sess., ch. 59/p. 503).
On April 3, 1801, all New York counties were redefined, with Albany County gaining .(N.Y. Laws 1801,24th sess., ch. 123/p. 290).
On March 3, 1808, Albany County turned Havre Island over to Saratoga County, with no resultant loss in land.(N.Y. Laws 1888, 111th sess., ch. 42/p. 85).
On March 7, 1809, Schenectady County was created from  of Albany County land.(N.Y. Laws 1808, 32nd sess., ch. 65, sec. 1/p. 458).
The result was the production of Albany County as it exists today.

The Capital District Transportation Committee (CDTC) is the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the Albany-Schenectady-Troy Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).
