[[All-purpose yardage]]

CATEGORIES: American football terminology, Canadian football terminology

All-purpose yards or All-purpose yardage is an American football and Canadian football statistical measure.  It is virtually the same as the statistic that some football leagues refer to as combined net yards.
Football associations differ on their own specific definitions of the term.  The National Collegiate Athletic Association, for example, defines the term as "the combined net yards gained by rushing, receiving, interception (and fumble) returns, punt returns, kickoff returns and runbacks of field goal attempts. All-purpose yardage does not include forward passing yardage" (at pg. 206).  Neither of these totals makes clear how they record yards from onside kick recoveries, blocked punts recovered behind the line of scrimmage, and missed field goal returns.
Brian Westbrook holds the NCAA all-division record for career all-purpose yards, Pinball Clemons holds the CFL record for career all-purpose yardage with 25,396 yards which also set a professional football record, while Chad Owens set a new single-season record during the 2012 season with 3,863 yards, which also set a new professional football record.cbc.html
