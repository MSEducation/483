Rahul Dravid(
As of October 2012, Dravid is the fourth-highest run scorer in Test cricket, after Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting and Kallis, and is only the second Indian cricketer, after Tendulkar to score 10,000 runs both in Tests and in ODIs.
In August 2011, after receiving a surprise call in the ODI series against England, Dravid declared his retirement from ODIs as well as Twenty20 International (T20I), and in March 2012, he announced his retirement from international and first-class cricket. He appeared in the 2012 Indian Premier League as captain of the Rajasthan Royals.
Rahul Dravid, along with Glenn McGrath were honoured during the seventh annual Bradman Awards function in Sydney on 1 November 2012.

Early life and introduction to cricket

Dravid was born in a Maharashtrian Deshastha Brahmin family in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. He did his schooling at St. Joseph's Boys High School, Bangalore and earned a degree in commerce from St. Joseph's College of Commerce, Bangalore. He was selected to India national cricket team while studying MBA in St Joseph's College of Business Administration
Dravid started playing cricket at the age of 12, and represented Karnataka at the under-15, the under-17 and the under-19 levels. He also played as wicket-keeper.
Dravid made his Ranji Trophy debut in February 1991, while he was still attending college.

International career

International Debut

Dravid made his international debut on 3 April 1996 in an ODI against Sri Lanka in the Singer Cup held in Singapore immediately after the 1996 World Cup replacing Vinod Kambli.
In contrast to his ODI debut, his Test debut was rather successful one. Dravid was selected for the Indian Test squad touring England on the backdrop of consistent heavy scoring in domestic cricket for 5 years,

Early years

=Success in Test cricket=

After a successful Test debut in England, Dravid played the one-off Test against Australia in Delhi- The first edition of Border-Gavaskar Trophy and his first test at home. Batting at no.6, he scored 40 runs in the First innings.
Dravid carried his form from South Africa to the West Indies where India toured to play a five match Test series. India lost the series 0-1.
Dravid continued his good run in the next season scoring 604 runs at an average of 50.33.
The century drought came to an end in the ensuing season when he further raised the bar of his performance scoring 752 runs in 7 Tests at an average of 62.66 that included four hundreds and one fifty.
Next up was a tour to New Zealand. The series that started with the first duck of his Test career in the first innings of the Second Test (First Test having been abandoned without a ball bowled)  The match ended in a draw.
Later that month, India played a two Test home series against Pakistan. Dravid didn't do much with the bat in the series. India lost the First Test
Pakistan played another Test in India a couple of weeks later- First Test of the first ever Asian Test Championship. Dravid couldn't do much with the bat, and India went on to lose the riot-affected Test at the Eden Gardens.

=Struggle in ODIs=

In a stark contrast to his test career, Dravid had to struggle a lot to make a mark in the ODIs.  India then went on to play a quadrangular series in Sri Lanka where Dravid could manage only 20 runs in two innings.
Dravid had the first taste of success in ODI cricket when India toured Canada to participate in the 1996 Sahara cup.
Following the Sahara cup, India played two triangular series- one involving Australia and South Africa in India
Dravid accompanied the Indian ODI squad to the tour of Zimbabwe but didn't get a game  despite a good performance in the previous triangular series in South Africa, though he got to play all the games in the following ODI series on the West Indies tour, thanks largely to a good performance in the test series preceding it. Dravid had moderate success in the four match ODI series scoring 121 runs at an average of 40.33.  only to be dropped again from the Indian ODI squad for the rest of the ODI season.
Dravid was recalled to the ODI squad in May 1998 for the Coca-Cola triangular series, but had a poor comeback scoring just 88 runs in 4 games including a 22-ball 5 runs and a 21-ball one run innings, both coming against Bangladesh.  and later dropped from the ODI squad for the Singer Nidahas triangular series in Sri Lanka.
Dravid returned to the ODI fold for the 1998 segment of Sahara Cup in Toronto but struggled with the bat scoring just 32 runs in 4 games,
By now, Dravid had been branded as a Test specialist by experts and sports journalists alike.  While he continued to score runs in Test cricket, his poor strike rate in ODIs came under scanner.  He drew criticism for not being able to adjust his style of play to the needs of ODI cricket, his inability to rotate strike and play big strokes, thereby putting pressure on fellow batsmen.  That changed in the year 1999.  Dravid worked hard to change his game by increasing his range of strokes and adjusting his batting style to suit the requirement of ODI cricket.
Dravid began his ODI campaign in the new year with a run-a-ball hundred against New Zealand in Taupo,  his previous three having ended up in India's defeats.
Dravid scored another hundred against Sri Lanka in 1998/99 Pepsi Cup at Nagpur,

Debut World Cup success

Dravid made his World Cup debut against South Africa at Hove striking a half century, but scored just 13 in the next game against Zimbabwe.  Though India failed to qualify for the semi-finals,  Dravid's success at the World Cup established him as the quintessential no. 3 batsman of Indian team in both formats of the game.
Dravid's post-World Cup campaign started on a poor note with just 40 runs coming in 4 games of Aiwa Cup in August 1999. He finally came into his own in the ensuing Singapore Challenge, where he top scored for India, including a hundred in the Finals. He also top scored for India in the DMC Cup including a fifty in the third game. While India lost Singapore Challenge Finals to West Indies, they took their revenge by beating them in the DMC Cup 2-1. By now, Dravid had started to keep wickets on an infrequent basis with India fielding him as a wicket-keeper in 4 out of last 10 ODIs. Dravid failed to make a mark in the LG Cup where he scored 81 runs in 4 games.
Dravid started off his post-World Cup Test cricket season on a positive note with a hundred against New Zealand in the First of a 3-match home series at Mohali in October 1999. Before this inning, Dravid had five test hundreds to his name from 29 tests, all of which came in away tests, this being his first test hundred on Indian soil. Except for this inning, he struggled throughout the rest of the season with just 281 runs in the next 7 tests at a poor average of 20.07 that included a 0-3 whitewash for India in Australia and a 0-2 whitewash against South Africa in a home series. He managed to cross 40 run mark just once in this 7 test span.
Meanwhile, Dravid continued his good run in ODI cricket. He scored 260 runs at an average of 60.00 in the 3-2 series win against New Zealand in November 1999. In the second game at Hyderabad, he scored 153 runs- his career best inning, which included 15 fours and two sixes. He featured in a 331 run partnership with Tendulkar- highest partnership in ODI cricket history. In 1999, Dravid scored 1761 runs in 43 ODIs at an average of 46.34 and a strike rate of 75.16 including 6 hundreds and 8 fifties. This was to be the best year of Dravid's ODI career.
Dravid followed up his previous year's ODI success with moderate success in the 1999–2000 Carlton & United Series and the bilateral series against South Africa and a below par performance in a tri-nation series in Sharjah. Dravid took two wickets in a single over against South Africa in the First ODI of the bilateral series at Kochi. Gary Kirsten became Dravid's first victim in ODI cricket. His bowling figures of 2/43 in 9 overs remained his career best ODI bowling figures. It was also the best bowling figure by any bowler for that particular match.
He was appointed the vice-captain during 2003 World Cup, in which India reached the finals, playing as a wicket-keeper batsman to accommodate an additional batsman, a strategy that worked out well. Dravid was appointed the captain for the Indian team for 2007 World Cup, where India had an unsuccessful campaign.
He then scored 200 not out – his first double century – against Zimbabwe in Delhi, and followed with a second innings of 70 not out to help India win the match. It was the first time in 12 months that he had passed 50 runs. He scored 162 runs in the next Test, getting him 432 runs in the series, with an average of 432 runs.

After 2000

In the second Test of a three-match series against Australia at Eden Gardens in 2001, Dravid had a partnership with VVS Laxman which led to a comeback victory for India. India was following on, and they achieved a 376-run fifth wicket partnership in the second innings, Dravid scoring 180 and Laxman 281.
Dravid started to establish himself as one of the India's premier Test batsmen in 2002. In April 2002, in first Test match of the series against the West Indies Georgetown, he scored 144 not out in the first innings after being hit by one of Mervyn Dillon's deliveries. and making him man of the match. His 602-run total in the four-Test series against England also got him the man of the series award.
In 2003–2004 season, Dravid scored three double centuries: one each against New Zealand, Australia and Pakistan. In the first innings of the second Test against Australia at Adelaide, India reached 85–4 in reply to Australia's 556, when Dravid and Laxman made 303 for the fifth wicket. Laxman was dismissed for 148 and Dravid went on make 233, at that time the highest score by an Indian batsman outside India. He made 72 not out in the second innings, and India won. During India's unsuccessful tour of England in 2011, in which their 4–0 loss cost them the top rank in Test cricket, Dravid made three centuries.

2011 Tour of England

Having regained his form on the tour to West Indies, where he scored a match-winning hundred in Sabina park, Jamaica, Dravid then toured England in what was billed as the series which would decide the World No. 1 ranking in tests. It would later be hailed as one of his greatest series performances by experts.
In the first test at Lord's, in reply to England's 474, Dravid scored an unbeaten 103, his first hundred at the ground where he debuted in 1996. He received scant support from his teammates as India were bowled out for 286 and lost the test.1st Test: England v India at Lord's, Jul 21-25, 2011 | Cricket Scorecard. ESPN Cricinfo. Retrieved on 2013-12-23. The 2nd test at Trentbridge, Nottingham again saw Dravid in brilliant form. Sent out to open the batting in place of an injured Gautam Gambhir, he scored his second successive hundred. His 117 though, again came in a losing cause, as a collapse of 6 wickets for 21 runs in the first innings led to a massive defeat by 319 runs.2nd Test: England v India at Nottingham, Jul 29-Aug 1, 2011 | Cricket Scorecard.

ESPN Cricinfo. Retrieved on 2013-12-23. However, he came back brilliantly in the fourth and final match at The Oval. Again opening the batting in place of Gambhir, he scored an unbeaten 146 out of India's total of 300, carrying his bat through the innings. Once again, though, his efforts were in vain as India lost the match, completing a 0–4 whitewash.4th Test: England v India at The Oval, Aug 18-22, 2011 | Cricket Scorecard. ESPN Cricinfo.

In all, he scored 461 runs in the four matches at an average of 76.83 with three hundreds. He accounted for over 26% of India's runs in the series and was named India's man of the series by England coach Andy Flower.

Retirement

Rahul Dravid was dropped from the ODI team in 2009, but was selected again for an ODI series in England in 2011, surprising even Dravid himself since, although he had not officially retired from ODI cricket, he had not expected to be recalled.
Dravid announced his retirement from Test and domestic cricket on 9 March 2012, after the 2011–12 tour of Australia, but he said he would captain the Rajasthan Royals in the 2012 Indian Premier League. He was the second-highest run scorer and had taken the highest number of catches in Test cricket at the time of his retirement.

Twenty20 career

Rahul Dravid played for Royal Challengers Bangalore in IPL 2008,2009 and 2010. Later he played for Rajasthan Royals and led it to finals of Champions League T20 in 2013, and play-offs of Indian Premier League in 2013. Dravid announced retirement from Twenty20 after playing the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in Sept.-Oct 2013. Indiatoday.in (2013-10-07). Retrieved on 2013-12-23.firstpost.html

Personal life

On 4 May 2003 he married Vijeta Pendharkar, a surgeon from Nagpur. Rahul can proficiently speak Marathi, Kannada and English.

Playing style

Dravid is known for his technique, and had been one of the best batsmen for the Indian cricket team. In the beginning, he was known as a defensive batsman who should be confined to Test cricket, and was dropped from the ODI squad due to a low strike rate. However in a period of his career, he began consistently scoring runs in ODIs as well, earning him the award of ICC Player of the year award. His nickname of 'The Wall' in Reebok advertisements is now used as his nickname. Dravid has scored 36 centuries in Test cricket at an average of 53.19; this included five double centuries. In one-dayers, he has an average of 39.49, and a strike rate of 71.22. He is one of the few Indians whose Test average is better at away than at home, averaging almost five runs more in foreign pitches. Retrieved 23 November 2010. As of 23 September 2010, Dravid's Test average in abroad is 55.53, and his Test average at home is 50.76; his ODI average in foreign is 37.93
Dravid's sole Test wicket was of Ridley Jacobs in the fourth Test match against the West Indies during the 2001–2002 series. While he has no pretensions to being a bowler, Dravid often kept wicket for India in ODIs. Dravid is now a specialist batsman, averaging 63.51 in matches played since 1 January 2000.
Dravid was involved in two of the largest partnerships in ODIs: a 318-run partnership with Sourav Ganguly, the first pair to combine for a 300-run partnership, and then a 331-run partnership with Sachin Tendulkar, which is a world record. He also holds the record for the greatest number of innings played since debut before being dismissed for a duck. His highest scores in ODIs and Tests are 153 and 270 respectively. Each of his five double centuries in Tests was a higher score than his previous double century (200*, 217, 222, 233, 270).
Also, Dravid is the current world record holder for the highest percentage of runs scored in matches won under a single captain, where the captain has won more than 20 Tests. In the 21 Test matches India won under Ganguly's captaincy, Dravid scored at a record average of 102.84 runs; scoring 2571 runs, with nine hundreds, three of them being double-centuries, and ten fifties in 32 innings. He contributed nearly 23% of the total runs scored by India in those 21 matches, which is almost one run out of every four runs the team scored.
He was named one of the Wisden cricketers of the year in 2000. Though primarily a defensive batsman, Dravid scored 50 runs not out in 22 balls (a strike rate of 227.27) against New Zealand in Hyderabad on 15 November 2003, the second fastest 50 among Indian batsmen. Only Ajit Agarkar's 67 runs of 21 balls is faster than that of Dravid.
In 2004, Dravid was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India. On 7 September 2004, he was awarded the inaugural Player of the year award and the Test player of the year award by the International Cricket Council (ICC). On 18 March 2006, Dravid played his 100th Test against England in Mumbai.
In 2006, it was announced that he would remain captain of the Indian team up to the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies.
However after the series against England, he stepped down as the Indian captain due to personal reasons. MS Dhoni took over as ODI captain, whereas Anil Kumble replaced him in test matches.
In 2007, he was dropped from the Indian ODI Squad following poor series against Australia. Dravid went back to play for Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy, scoring 218 runs against Mumbai.
In 2008, he made 93 runs in the first innings of the Perth test, the highest score of the match, to help India win and make the series 1–2. However, he was ignored by selectors for the subsequent one-day tri-series.
After a barren run in Test matches in 2008, Dravid came under increasing media pressure to retire or be dropped. In the Second Test against England in Mohali, he scored 136 runs, putting on a triple-century stand with Gautam Gambhir.
After reaching 10,000 test runs milestone, he said,"It's a proud moment for sure. For me, growing up, I dreamt of playing for India. When I look back, I probably exceeded my expectations with what I have done over the last 10 to 12 years. I never had an ambition to do it because I never believed – it is just a reflection of my longevity in the game."
Dravid is also one of the two batsmen to score 10,000 runs at a single batting position and is the third highest run scorer in Test Cricket, next to Tendulkar and Ponting.

Controversies

Ball-tampering incident

In January 2004, Dravid was found guilty of ball tampering during an ODI with Zimbabwe. Match referee Clive Lloyd adjudged the application of an energy sweet to the ball as a deliberate offence, although Dravid himself denied this was his intent. Lloyd emphasised that television footage caught Dravid putting a lozenge on the ball during the Zimbabwean innings on Tuesday night at the Gabba. According to the ICC's Code of Conduct, players are not allowed to apply substances to the ball other than sweat and saliva. Dravid was fined half of his match fee.
Indian coach John Wright came out in defence of Dravid, stating that "It was an innocent mistake". Wright argued that Dravid had been trying to apply saliva to the ball when parts of a losenge he had been chewing stuck to the ball; Dravid then tried to wipe it off. ICC regulations prevented Dravid from commenting about the issue, but former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly also stated that Dravid's act was "just an accident".

Multan declaration

One of Dravid's most debated decisions was taken in March 2004, when he was standing in as the captain for injured Sourav Ganguly. India's first innings was declared at a point when Sachin Tendulkar was at 194 runs with 16 overs remaining on Day 2.
