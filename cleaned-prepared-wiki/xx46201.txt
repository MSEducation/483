Garuda is currently the official airline partner of Liverpool FC. The airline received its IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) in 2008 and 2010.

History

Beginnings

The earliest predecessor to Garuda Indonesia was KNILM, Royal Dutch Indies Airways, founded in 1928 during the Dutch colonial period; despite the similar name, it was not a subsidiary of the main Dutch carrier KLM. KNILM was dissolved in 1947, and its assets were transferred to a new KLM subsidiary, KLM Interinsulair Bedrijf (KLM Interinsular Service), which was nationalized in December 1949.
Garuda Indonesia in its current institutional form had its beginnings in the Indonesian war of independence against the Dutch in the late 1940s, when Garuda flew special transports with a Douglas DC-3.> During the revolution, the airline supported Indonesian interests, such as carrying Indonesian leaders for diplomatic missions. Now, a chartered Garuda Indonesia Airbus A330-300 is used by the President of Indonesia for presidential travels.
The Burmese government helped the airline significantly during its beginnings. The country's national airline, Union of Burma Airways, often chartered this DC-3 for its own flights. Accordingly, upon Garuda's formal joint incorporation with KLM on 31 March 1950, the airline presented the Burmese government with a DC-3. By 1953, the airline had 46 aircraft, although by 1955 its Catalina fleet had been retired. Fourteen De Havilland Heron aircraft were acquired to serve shorter range routes. In June 1956, Garuda made its first Hajj flight, operated with a Convair 340 carrying 40 Indonesians, to the city of Mecca.
The name "Garuda" was derived from a Dutch poem written by a renowned Javanese scholar and poet Raden Mas Noto Soeroto; "Ik ben Garuda, Vishnoe's vogel, die zijn vleugels uitslaat hoog boven uw eilanden" which means "I'm Garuda, Vishnu's Bird, that spreads its wings high above the Islands". In Hindu mythology, Garuda is the name of Lord Vishnu's mount (vahana).
The line was mentioned by Sukarno during the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference at The Hague, from 23 August to 2 November 1949.

1960s: Growth and expansion

The 1960s were times of growth for the airline; the fleet in 1960 included eight Convair 240s, eight Convair 340s and eight Convair 440s. In 1961 three Lockheed L-188 Electras four-engined turboprop airliners were acquired, and in late 1965, three Convair 990 Coronado four-engined jet aircraft were introduced and a route was opened to Kai Tak International Airport in Hong Kong.
After having concentrated on domestic and regional services, the first scheduled flights to Europe were added on 28 September 1963, to Amsterdam and Frankfurt. In 1965, flights to Europe were expanded to include Rome and Paris via Bombay and Cairo, with the exclusive use of Garuda's Convair 990 aircraft. That year, flights to People's Republic of China started, with Garuda flying to Canton via Phnom Penh. Also in 1965, the jet age arrived for Garuda, with a Douglas DC-8 that flew to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport via Colombo, Bombay, Rome and Prague.

1970s–1980s: New equipment

During the early 1970s, Garuda Indonesia introduced McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and Fokker F28 Fellowship twin-jet aircraft, and at one point Garuda owned 62 Fokker jets, making Garuda the world's largest operator of F28s at that time. In 1973, the carrier introduced the Douglas DC-10; it later introduced the Boeing 747-200.
The airline added the  Airbus A300-B4 to its fleet on 21 June 1982. Garuda was the launch customer for Airbus A300 with two-man crew cockpit (designated A300B4-220FFCC). By 1984, nine of these were in service, supplemented by 8 Douglas DC-10s, 24 Douglas DC-9s, 45 Fokker F-28s, and 6 Boeing 747-200s. In 1985 under Reyn Altin Johannes Lumenta Garuda created a controversy by hiring foreign brand consultants Landor Associates to create a new logo and colour scheme for Garuda Indonesia, a project that cost the company millions of US dollars. This move was later on applauded as vital for the reputation and corporate identity of Garuda Indonesia as the national airline.
Under Lumenta, Garuda also increased flights frequency and destinations, reduced ticket prices and collaborated with Merpati, introducing flexible tickets valid for both Indonesian airlines."Reyn Altin Johannes Lumenta", Apa dan Siapa (What and Who), Pusat Data dan Analisa (Centre of Data and Analysis), Tempo Indonesia,  Airline Directory." Flight International. 28 April 1979. 1377.

1990s: Difficult time for Garuda

In 1991, Garuda purchased 9 McDonnell-Douglas MD-11s; it later introduced Boeing 747-400 in 1994 (two of them were purchased directly from Boeing, the third was ex-Varig), and Airbus A330-300, in 1996. But during this time, Garuda suffered two major accidents. The first of these happened in Japan in the summer of 1996; the second happened in 1997 when an Airbus A300 crashed near Medan, North Sumatra, killing everyone aboard in what remains Indonesia's worst aviation disaster. The 1997 Asian financial crisis hit Indonesia and Garuda hard, resulting in severe cutbacks on unprofitable routes. Despite once having a comprehensive worldwide route network, Garuda currently suspends services to United States, despite once flown to Honolulu and continues to Los Angeles. Largely due to historical links with the Netherlands, Garuda continued to operate flights to Amsterdam and Frankfurt after the initial cutbacks, although these flights were also discontinued from 28 October 2004. The situation was exacerbated by the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., the Bali bombings, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and the SARS scare, all of which contributed to a downturn in air travel and Indonesian tourism. However, by 2005, the airline had largely recovered from its economic problems. Fundinguniverse. Retrieved 25 November 2010.

2000–2009: Plummeting reputation and EU ban

On 7 September 2004, human rights activist Munir Said Thalib was murdered on Garuda Indonesia Flight 974.
In June 2007, the EU banned Garuda Indonesia, along with all other Indonesian airlines, from flying into any European countries, following the crash of a Boeing 737-400 earlier that year. With the support of the international aviation industry for all Indonesian airlines, the EU promised to review its ban and sent a team of experts, led by the European Commission's Air Safety Administrator Federico Grandini to Indonesia to consider lifting the ban."EU to audit Indonesian airlines with focus on safety, procedures In August 2007, the transportation minister of Indonesia announced that the EU would lift its ban hopefully sometime in October, stating that the ban was attributed to communication breakdown between the two parties and that discussion was in progress. In November 2007, Garuda announced its intention to fly to Amsterdam from Jakarta and Denpasar on the condition that the European Union lifted the ban on the airline.

Presidents and CEOs

Corporate affairs and identity

Branding and livery

Since its establishment, Garuda Indonesia has changed its branding and livery a few times. During the early years, Garuda introduced a red and white color scheme in accordance to the Indonesian national identity and the Indonesian flag. In the 1950s, "Garuda Indonesian Airways" introduced a bird logo: a triangle stylized eagle-like Garuda with red and white shield. The logo was painted on the vertical stabilizer of Garuda's fleet from 1960 to 1969. In the 1970s, a logotype with a unique font replaced the triangular eagle as Garuda's corporate identity, along with a new color scheme consisting of a red and orange "hockey stick" line running along the aircraft's windows and vertical stabilizer.
In 1985, Garuda undergoes a complete branding makeover, changing its name into "Garuda Indonesia" along with its color scheme, logo and logotype. The new branding and livery was created by Landor Associates who also created the new iconic bird logo: the Garuda symbol with five bended lines forming its wings. The color scheme was changed completely to a deep royal blue and aqua color, said to be inspired by the nature of Indonesia that was dominated by tropical greenery and seas when viewed from the air. The nationalistic red and white color scheme was no longer used.
In 2009, a new branding initiative was launched through a new image, developed once again by brand consultant Landor Associates, a new spin of the idea called "nature's wing". Garuda has since replaced the old logo painted on its fleet vertical stabilizer with this new "nature's wing" graphic of blue and aqua shades. The "nature's wing" graphic was inspired by the wings of tropical birds as well as the ripples of waves upon the water. The iconic bird symbol designed by Landor 24 years earlier is still maintained as Garuda Indonesia's logo, however the logotype is changed completely. The new look is expected to be able to "Capture the Spirit of Friendliness and Professionalism of Indonesia".
To celebrate its 62 years of service on 26 January 2011, Garuda Indonesia painted 2 of its Boeing 737-800 aircraft with the retro liveries the airline used in the 1960s and 1970s.

Codeshare agreements and alliances

Codesharing has allowed Garuda Indonesia to expand services into Western Europe and the Middle East. In 2009 Garuda Indonesia expressed an interest in joining the SkyTeam airline alliance, which would make it the second airline in Southeast Asia to join after Vietnam Airlines. Membership would open SkyTeam's network to Indonesian, Australian, and New Zealand markets. In December 2009, three SkyTeam members – Korean Air, KLM, and Delta Air Lines – committed to supporting Garuda Indonesia to join SkyTeam. This made Garuda Indonesia eligible to apply for membership in the alliance. On 23 November 2010, Garuda Indonesia signed an agreement to join SkyTeam. The airline became the 20th member of the alliance on 5 March 2014.
Garuda Indonesia offers flights to 16 other international destinations through codeshare agreements with, * indicate as SkyTeam:

Additionally, a fourth flight from Melbourne to Denpasar began on 22 July. On 2 September, another extra service departed from Melbourne to bring the total number of flights per week to five, and a sixth flight left from Sydney. This extra capacity was in response to an increase in the number of Australians who traveled to Bali in the first quarter of 2008, marking a resurgence in Balinese tourism, which was hard hit by the 2002 and 2005 Bali bombings.
On August 2008, a codeshare agreement between Singapore Airlines and the airline on route between Singapore and Denpasar was established. Singapore Airlines is the operating carrier.
A partnership agreement with Etihad Airways was announced on 16 October 2012. The partnership includes a codeshare agreement for a total of 36 flights between the two airlines; subject to Government Regulatory Approval.

Explore and Explore Jet sub-brands

As Indonesia's flag carrier, Garuda Indonesia tries to connect many parts of Indonesia to support the government's "Indonesian Interconnectivity" program. However, there are many remote and smaller airports that cannot be reached by Garuda Indonesia's fleet of Boeing 737-800s. This is caused by the lack of airport infrastructure in smaller cities and remote areas, such as insufficient runway length that mostly less than 1,600 meters. 
In line with its Quantum Leap plan, Garuda Indonesia has ordered brand-new Bombardier CRJ1000 and leased ATR 72 to reach smaller airports from Garuda's hub like Ngurah Rai International Airport, Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, and Kuala Namu International Airport. On 25 November 2013, Garuda Indonesia has launched its new sub-brands "Explore" and "Explore Jet", and opening shorter range lines to connects Indonesian islands. These new lines such as from Denpasar on to Labuan Bajo, Ende, and Bima, as well as from Makassar and Ambon to remote destinantions in those regions. This popularly called perintis ("pioneer") lines traditionally served by other government-owned airlines — Merpati Nusantara Airlines and also its competitor Wings Air.

The 20th SkyTeam Member

On March 5, 2014, Garuda Indonesia officially joined the SkyTeam Alliance and becomes its 20th member. The inclusion of Garuda Indonesia adds 40 new destinations to SkyTeam's global network and strengthens the alliance presence in Southeast Asia and Australia. With the arrival of Garuda Indonesia to SkyTeam, a variety of facilities are given as including SkyPriority, as well as changing its current frequent flyer membership into GarudaMiles. In addition Garuda was connected with 140 new destinations. By this time, the journey will be much faster. Garuda has also teamed up with the world's major airlines, such as KLM, Air France, Delta Air Lines, Aeroflot, China Airlines, Aeroméxico and Saudia.

Some Boeing 737 Classics are still being operated on domestic routes which are newly opened and also on some airports which do not have long enough runways to handle larger aircraft such as Boeing 737-800 (less than 2000 meters). Those remaining Boeing 737 Classics fleets will be replaced by Bombardier CRJ1000 NextGen or Boeing 737-800. 
The ATR 72 turboprop entered into service by the end of 2013 for serving new inter-island routes to airports in the eastern part of Indonesia that cannot handle jet aircraft.
