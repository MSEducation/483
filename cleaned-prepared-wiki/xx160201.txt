History

"Living Type" was released with one b-side track, dubbed "Other Delicacies".  The track consisted of six 90 second blocks of music, with instrumental backgrounds.  Guitarist Darren Middleton explained that the single would only have two tracks listed, and when referring to "Other Delicacies", said that "all the songs are recorded in a block so you can't skip them, you have to listen to the whole single".
"Living Type" was first performed live by Powderfinger whilst opening for You Am I on their "Uptight Express Tour".

Song meanings

Whilst there was some speculation that "Living Type" was "a cheesy, angsty love song", Powderfinger's lead singer; Bernard Fanning (who wrote the song) said it was actually about Charles Manson, and the people affected by his cult.  Fanning said that he was unable to control what people thought about the song, and so didn't try, but that "cheesy love song" that it had been dubbed was "not the intention" of the song.
