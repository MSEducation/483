Alfred Ray Spohrer (December 3, 1902 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania â€“ July 17, 1972 in Plymouth, New Hampshire), was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the New York Giants and Boston Braves.   

Baseball career

He began his professional baseball career in  The Barons sold Spohrer's contract to John McGraw's New York Giants for $10,000, a record for a Class B player at the time.
Spohrer made his major league debut with the New York Giants on April 13, 1928 at the age of 25 but, after only two games, he was traded along with Virgil Barnes, Ben Cantwell and Bill Clarkson to the Boston Braves for Joe Genewich.
Spohrer had his best season offensively in 1930 when he posted a .361 on-base percentage, a .441 slugging percentage and led the Braves with a .317 batting average in 112 games. That season, a lively ball wound with special Australian wool was used by major league baseball, resulting in a league batting average that was above .300 for the only time in baseball history. The raised stitching on the ball allowed pitchers to grip the ball better and throw sharper curveballs.
From 1933 to 1935 Spohrer shared catching duties with Shanty Hogan who had been obtained from the New York Giants. In February 1936, Spohrer was released to the Columbus Red Birds of the American Association.
