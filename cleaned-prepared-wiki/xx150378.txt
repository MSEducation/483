[[Triangle-free graph]]

CATEGORIES: Graph families

In the mathematical area of graph theory, a triangle-free graph is an undirected graph in which no three vertices form a triangle of edges. Triangle-free graphs may be equivalently defined as graphs with clique number ≤ 2, graphs with girth ≥ 4, graphs with no induced 3-cycle, or locally independent graphs.
By Turán's theorem, the n-vertex triangle-free graph with the maximum number of edges is a complete bipartite graph in which the numbers of vertices on each side of the bipartition are as equal as possible.

Triangle finding problem

The triangle finding problem is the problem of determining whether a graph is triangle-free or not. When the graph does contain a triangle, algorithms are often required to output three vertices which form a triangle in the graph.
It is possible to test whether a graph with m edges is triangle-free in time O(m1.41). Another approach is to find the trace of A3, where A is the adjacency matrix of the graph. The trace is zero if and only if the graph is triangle-free. For dense graphs, it is more efficient to use this simple algorithm which relies on matrix multiplication, since it gets the time complexity down to O(n2.373), where n is the number of vertices.
As  show, triangle-free graph recognition is equivalent in complexity to median graph recognition; however, the current best algorithms for median graph recognition use triangle detection as a subroutine rather than vice versa.
The decision tree complexity or query complexity of the problem, where the queries are to an oracle which stores the adjacency matrix of a graph, is Θ(n2). However, for quantum algorithms, the best known lower bound is Ω(n), but the best known algorithm is O(n1.29) due to .

Coloring triangle-free graphs

Much research about triangle-free graphs has focused on graph coloring. Every bipartite graph (that is, every 2-colorable graph) is triangle-free, and Grötzsch's theorem states that every triangle-free planar graph may be 3-colored.). However, nonplanar triangle-free graphs may require many more than three colors.
 showed that the number of colors needed to color any m-edge triangle-free graph is
and that there exist triangle-free graphs that have chromatic numbers proportional to this bound.
There have also been several results relating coloring to minimum degree in triangle-free graphs. . found examples of triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number and minimum degree (1/3 − ε)n for any ε > 0.
