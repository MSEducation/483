Verizon Communications ( The company is based in New York City at 1095 Avenue of the Americas.
What eventually became Verizon was founded as Bell Atlantic, which was one of the seven Baby Bells that were formed after AT&T Corporation was forced to relinquish its control of the Bell System by order of the Justice Department of the United States. Bell Atlantic came into existence in 1984 with a footprint from New Jersey to Virginia, with each area having a separate operating company (consisting of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone, and C&P Telephone).
As part of the rebranding that the Baby Bells took in the mid-1990s, all of the operating companies assumed the Bell Atlantic name. In 1997, Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX. In addition, Bell Atlantic moved their headquarters from Philadelphia into the old NYNEX headquarters and rebranded the entire company as Bell Atlantic.
In 2000 Bell Atlantic merged with GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. The combined company elected to change its name to "Verizon", a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for "truth") and horizon.  The company's headquarters, while always having been located in New York City, was originally located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas until the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger, when its headquarters was moved to the Verizon Building at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan before returning to the 1095 space in 2013.Storm-soaked Verizon decamps from downtown by DANIEL GEIGER, Crane's New York Business, Sept 12, 2013  Retrieved Nov 20, 2013

History

Formation (2000-2002)

Verizon Communications formed in June 2000 when the Federal Communications Commission approved a US$64.7 billion merger of telephone companies Bell Atlantic and GTE, nearly two years after the businesses proposed the deal in July 1998. The approval came with 25 stipulations to preserve competition between local phone carriers, including investing in new markets and broadband technologies.
The new venture was headed by co-CEOs Charles Lee, formerly the CEO of GTE, and Bell Atlantic CEO Ivan Seidenberg.
Upon its inception, Verizon became the largest local telephone company in the United States, operating 63 million telephone lines in 40 states. The company also inherited 25 million mobile phone customers. Additionally, Verizon offered Internet services and long-distance calling in New York, before expanding long-distance operations to other states.
The name Verizon derives from the combination of the words veritas, Latin for truth, and horizon. The name was chosen from 8,500 candidates and the company spent $300 million on marketing the new brand. 
Two months before the FCC gave final approval on the formation of Verizon Communications, Bell Atlantic formed Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with the British telecommunications company Vodafone in April 2000. Due to its size, Verizon Wireless was able to offer national coverage at competitive rates, giving it an advantage over regional providers typical of the time.

Lines of Business

Verizon Communications' operations are divided into three business units: wireless, residential and small business services, and enterprise services.

Wireless

Verizon Wireless provides mobile phone, text message, and data services for phones, tablets, and computers, as well as wireless hotspot devices. As of September 2013, Verizon Wireless had 101.2 million wireless connections, and its 4G LTE network covered over 303 million people.

Residential and small business

Verizon provides wireline phone service, Internet access, and television to residences and small businesses, via either copper wire or fiber optic cable.
Verizon's FiOS service, launched in 2005, provides Internet, television, and phone service using fiber optic cable instead of copper wire. FiOS cable passes near 18 million homes, of which 14.6 million are completely ready for service; the other 3.4 million homes would require some additional wiring to support FiOS. As of September 2013, Verizon had a total of 5.9 million FiOS Internet subscribers and 5.2 million FiOS TV customers, with FiOS accounting for 75% of Verizon's revenues from fixed-line consumer retail. In September 2013, Verizon announced that FiOS TV subscribers would be able to watch some television channels live on their mobile devices.
In areas where Verizon has installed FiOS service, the copper wires, which are more expensive to maintain, are removed. This prevents a customer who has switched to FiOS from switching back to services provided by copper wires, such as DSL service.
Verizon operates landline services in 12 states (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Florida, Texas, California) and Washington, D.C. through the following operating companies:

Enterprise

Enterprise Solutions provides a cloud-based platform to deliver IT, security, mobility, and collaboration solutions to customers. It supports service in 75 countries, and has a global IP network that reaches more than 150 countries, with 99 percent of Fortune 500 companies using Verizon Enterprise Solutions.

Verizon Partner Program

On February 28, 2013, Verizon launched the Verizon Partner Program (VPP), which offers medium-sized preferred access to its businesses' cloud, mobility, communications, and networking solutions. There are four levels to VPP membership: Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Member.
