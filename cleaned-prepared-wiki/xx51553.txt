[[Ranunculaceae]]

CATEGORIES: Eudicot families, Ranunculaceae

Ranunculaceae (buttercup or crowfoot family; Latin rānunculus "little frog", from rāna "frog") are a family of about 1700 species of flowering plants in about 60 genera, distributed worldwide.
The largest genera are Ranunculus (600 species), Delphinium (365), Thalictrum (330), Clematis (325), and Aconitum (300).

Description

Ranunculaceae are mostly herbaceous plants, but with some woody climbers (such as Clematis) and subshrubs (e.g. Xanthorhiza).
Members of the Ranunculaceae (except buttercups) usually have five colored sepals instead of petals, and
divided leaves and nonwoody tissue (except clematis). 
Leaves are usually divided or lobed, but are heart-shaped or narrow and undivided in some species of Ranunculus, and usually arise from the base of the plant, or alternately from the stem; in Clematis they are opposite. Perennial species form small rhizomes or tubers that develop new roots each year.
Flowers may be solitary, but are frequently found aggregated in cymes, panicles, or spikes. Many species have no true petals, and the 'flower' is formed by a brightly colored group of sepals called a calyx.  There are usually five sepals per flower, though they come in a wide variety of shapes. Ranunculus (buttercups) is the only genus in the family with a true calyx and petals. There are many stamens surrounding many fused carpels.
The fruit is most commonly a follicle (e. g. Helleborus, Nigella) or an achene (e. g. Ranunculus, Clematis).
Ranunculaceae contain protoanemonin, which is toxic to humans and animals. Other poisonous or toxic compounds, alkaloids and glycosides, are also common.

Taxonomy

The family Ranunculaceae is included in the  Ranunculales which is the sole order of the Ranunculanae, a superorder  of eudicots according to  APG 3 systematics. The phylogeny is well illustrated in Angiosperm Phylogeny Poster

Taxonomic comparisons

­According to Dr John David, (2010)Plants in their proper places the Ranuculaceae are combined with the Eupteleaceae, Lardizabalaceae, Menispermaceae, Berberidaceae, and Papaveraceae in the Ranunculales, the only order in the superorder Ranunculanae.  This follows the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group.
Takhtajan 1997 includes the Ranunculaceae as the only family in the Ranunculales which he placed in a subclass, the Ranunculidae, instead of a superorder.   Previously, Thorn 1992 placed the Ranunculaceae in the Berberidales, an order within the Superorder Magnolianae. Earlier Cronquist in 1981 included the Ranunculaceae along with seven other families in the Rancunculales which was included in the Magnoliidae, which he regarded as a subclass.Flowering Plant Gateway

The genus Glaucidium was once put in its own family (Glaucidiaceae), but has been recently recognised as a primitive member of Ranunculaceae. Tamura (1993) recognised five subfamilies, mainly based on chromosomic and floral characteristics (Hydrastidoideae, Thalictroideae, Isopyroideae, Ranunculoideae, Helleboroideae).
Hydrastidoideae and Glaucidioideae have only one species, Hydrastis canadense and Glaucidium palmatum respectively. Coptoideae has 17 species and Thalictroideae has 450, including Thalictrum and Aquilegia. The other genera (2025 species, 81% of the family) belong to Ranunculoideae.
Some older classifications included Paeonia (peony) in Ranunculaceae but this genus is now placed in its own family, Paeoniaceae in order Saxifragales. Circaeaster and Kingdonia are now placed in Circaeasteraceae.

Fossil record

Fossils of fruits, pollen, seeds, and leaves are known from several dozen locations.  The fossil record begins in the early Cretaceous and continues throughout the Tertiary. In most cases, the fossils are assigned to extant genera, or show a close relationship to a particular extant genus.

Uses

Some Ranunculaceae are used as herbal medicines because of their alkaloids and glycosides, such as Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal), whose root is used as a tonic.
More than 30 species are used in homeopathy, including Aconitum napellus,  Cimicifuga racemosa, Clematis recta, Clematis virginiana, Hydrastis canadensis, Ranunculus bulbosus, Helleborus niger, Delphinium staphisagria, Pulsatilla nigricans etc.
Many genera are well known as cultivated flowers, such as Aconitum (monkshood), Consolida (larkspur), Delphinium, Helleborus (Christmas rose), Trollius (globeflower).
The seeds of  Nigella sativa, are used as a spice in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine.
