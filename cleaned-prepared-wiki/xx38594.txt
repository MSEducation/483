Ron Stander (born October 17, 1944 in Columbia, South Carolina) is a boxing referee and former professional boxer from Council Bluffs, Iowa, who was once a challenger for the heavyweight championship of the world.
Stander built up a 23-1-1 record, including a knockout win over future world title challenger, the hard-punching Earnie Shavers, and decisions over fringe contenders Jack O'Halloran, Manuel Ramos, and Thad Spencer. Stander was ranked in the top 15 among the world's Heavyweights when he was given a shot at world champion Joe Frazier, prompting his wife Darlene to say the now famous words, "You don't take a Volkswagen into the Indianapolis 500 unless you know a short-cut." 
The fight took place at the Civic Auditorium in Omaha, Nebraska on 25 May 1972. Stander was not knocked out by Frazier, but he lost by a technical knockout after the fourth round, due to heavy cuts, requiring 32 stitches after the fight. This was Frazier's last successful title defense; he would lose to George Foreman in his next bout.
Stander continued boxing until 1982; among his most notable opponents were future world title holders Ken Norton and Gerrie Coetzee, losing to both by TKO. He retired with a record of 37 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws, 28 of those wins coming by knockout.
Stander's success earned him a unique title: The Council Bluffs Butcher.
In 2004, an award-winning documentary entitled "The Bluffs Butcher" and produced by journalism student Andrew Batt, was released. The documentary told the story of Iowa's arguably best shot at a World Heavyweight Boxing Title and chronicled Stander's journey from virtual unknown to boxing's largest stage.
