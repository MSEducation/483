Uzundzhovo (

Trade fair

In Ottoman times, Uzundzhovo was famous as the site of the international Uzundzhovo Fair (Узунджовски панаир, Uzundzhovski panair). According to the German historian Hammer, the fair was established by Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha in 1593. The 69th issue of the Istanbul-based Bulgarian newspaper Tsarigradski vestnik of 15 October 1849 describes the fair as follows:
A newspaper report in Vek of 7 September 1874 underlines the importance of the fair:
The Uzundzhovo Fair was one of the most famous fairs in the Ottoman Empire and the most important one in Rumelia; as such, the authorities took great care to keep the roads in good condition and protect the merchants from the robbers hiding in the nearby forests. However, this was not always possible and robber assaults were always a major issue. Some of the more well-known goods that were sold at the fair were velvet and silk clothes, gems, coffee, sugar, Persian carpets, English tin and paints, Italian cloth and glass, Russia leathers. The fair was visited by famous 19th-century Bulgarians such as Georgi Rakovski, Nayden Gerov, Petko Slaveykov, Dobri Chintulov, Hadzhi Dimitar and Vasil Levski. Gradually, the Uzundzhovo Fair lost its international importance. The Plovdiv Fair, organized since 1892, assumed its role of the region's leading trade show.
