[[Hong Kong League XI]]

CATEGORIES: Hong Kong First Division League, Representative teams of association football leagues

Hong Kong League XI, or known as Hong Kong XI or Hong Kong League Selection, is a football team which represents the Hong Kong First Division League in exhibitional matches, mainly the Lunar New Year Cup. 
The team is formed by the top players in Hong Kong First Division League. Both Hong Kong and foreign players, including those from mainland China, can be included in the team. However, as the quality of local players is usually lower, it has been often that most of the outfield players are foreigners. 
In recent years, HKFA fielded the Hong Kong national football team to participate in matches which are usually played by Hong Kong League XI. Therefore, Hong Kong League XI has not formed a squad for a few years. However, the team returned and competed in the 2007 Lunar New Year Cup.
