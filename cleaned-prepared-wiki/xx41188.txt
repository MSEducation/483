[[Nestor (genus)]]

CATEGORIES: Nestor, Bird genera, Tribes of birds, Parrots

The genus Nestor is one of two genera of the family Nestoridae.  Together with the  Kakapo in the Strigopidae tribe, they form the small parrot superfamily Strigopoidea. The genus Nestor contains two extant parrot species from New Zealand and two extinct species from Norfolk Island, Australia and Chatham Island, New Zealand, respectively. All species are large stocky birds with short squarish tails. A defining characteristic of the genus is the tongue, which is tipped with a hair-like fringe.

Classification

All four species in the genus Nestor are thought to stem from a 'proto-Kākā', dwelling in the forests of New Zealand 5 million years ago.S.; de Kloet, S.R. (2005). The evolution of the spindlin gene in birds: sequence analysis of an intron of the spindlin W and Z gene reveals four major divisions of the Psittaciformes. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 36: 706–721.  Together, they form the Strigopoidea, with comprises an ancient group that split off from all other Psittaciformes before their radiation.

Species

There are two surviving species and at least one well documented extinct species in the genus Nestor. Very little is known about the fourth, the Chatham Kaka, which may have been conspecific with another Kaka species.
