[[File:Pelvic Fracture Young-Burgess Classification.
Force and break are shown by matching color:
Anteroposterior compression type I (orange), Anteroposterior compression type  II (green), Anteroposterior compression type III (blue); Lateral compression type I (red), Lateral compression type II (purple), F. Lateral compression type III (black).
Increased force and breaks are shown by increasing size.

The Young classification system is based on mechanism of injury: lateral compression, anteroposterior compression, vertical shear, or a combination of forces. Lateral compression (LC) fractures involve transverse fractures of the pubic rami, either ipsilateral or contralateral to a posterior injury.
There are multiple ways to classify pelvic fractures, one of them being the Young-Burgess classification, which includes anteroposterior compression type I, II and III, lateral
compression types I, II and III, and vertical shear.
The most common force type, lateral compression (LC) forces, from side-impact automobile accidents and pedestrian injuries, can result in an internal rotation. The superior and inferior pubic rami may fracture anteriorly, for example. Injuries from shear forces, like falls from above, can result in disruption of ligaments or bones. When multiple forces occur, it is called combined mechanical injury (CMI).

Open book fracture

One specific kind of pelvic fracture is known as an 'open book' fracture. This is often the result from a heavy impact to the groin (pubis), a common motorcycling accident injury. In this kind of injury, the left and right halves of the pelvis are separated at front and rear, the front opening more than the rear, i.e. like opening a book. Depending on the severity, this may require surgical reconstruction before rehabilitation.

Treatment

A pelvic fracture is often complicated and treatment can be a long and painful process.
Depending on the severity, pelvic fractures can be treated with or without surgery.

Surgery

Surgery is often required for pelvic fractures. Many methods of pelvic stabilization are used including external fixation or internal fixation and traction.

Rehabilitation

Pelvic fractures that are treatable without surgery are treated with bed rest. Once the fracture has healed enough, rehabilitation can be started with first standing upright with the help of a physical therapist, followed by starting to walk using a walker and eventually progressing to a cane.

Prevention

Pelvic fractures can be dangerous to one's physical health. As the human body ages, the bones become more weak and brittle and are therefore more susceptible to fractures. Certain precautions are crucial in order to lower the risk of getting pelvic fractures. The most damaging is one from a car accident, cycling accident, or falling from a high building which can result in a high energy injury.  This can be very dangerous because the pelvis supports many internal organs and can damage these organs.  Other parts of the body such as the head and chest usually occur due to pelvic fractures. Falling is one of the most common causes of a pelvic fracture. Therefore, proper precautions should be taken to prevent this from happening.

Precautions

There are a couple precautions that may decrease the risk of getting a pelvic fracture. One study that examined the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation found that oral vitamin D supplements reduced the risk of hip and nonvertebral fractures in older people. Certain types of equipment may help prevent pelvic fractures for the most at-risk groups.

Complications

Complications are likely to result in cases of excess blood loss or punctures to certain organs, possibly leading to shock

Prognosis

Mortality rates in patients with pelvic fractures are between 10 and 16 percent. However, death is typically due to associated trauma affecting other organs, such as the brain.  Death rates due to complications directly related to pelvic fractures, such as bleeding, are relatively low.

Epidemiology

About 10 percent of patients that seek treatment at a level 1 trauma center after a blunt force injury have a pelvic fracture. Motorcycle injuries are the most common cause of pelvic fractures, followed by injuries to pedestrians caused by motor vehicles, large falls (over 15 feet), and motor vehicle crashes.
