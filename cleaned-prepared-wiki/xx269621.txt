Symonds Street Cemetery is a historic cemetery and park in central Auckland, New Zealand. It is in 5.8 hectares of deciduous forest on the western slope of Grafton Gully, Maintenance and administration of the cemetery is provided by the Auckland Council.

History

Symonds Street Cemetery was the first official cemetery in Auckland, in use from 1842. Many of Auckland's early colonists are buried here, including William Hobson, the first Governor of New Zealand and co-author of the Treaty of Waitangi.
The New Zealand Herald columnist Brian Rudman has repeatedly criticised the state of disrepair, vandalism, and the presence of vagrants at the cemetery, and called for the city council to improve the maintenance.
In October 2012 more than 20 of the headstones were sprayed with anti-Semetic graffiti and swastikas.
