The National Film Registry (NFR) is the United States National Film Preservation Board's selection of films for preservation in the Library of Congress. The Board, established by the National Film Preservation Act of 1988, was reauthorized by acts of Congress in 1992, 1996, 2005, and again in October 2008.
The NFR names to its list up to 25 "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant films" each year, showcasing the range and diversity of American film heritage to increase awareness for its preservation.
The Registry includes films ranging from Hollywood classics to orphan films. A film is not required to be feature-length, nor is it required to have been theatrically released. The Registry contains newsreels, silent films, experimental films, short subjects, films out of copyright protection, film serials, home films, documentaries, independent films, television films, and music videos. As of the 2013 listing, there are 625 films preserved in the Registry.
The earliest listed film is Newark Athlete (1891), and the most recent is Decasia (2002). Counting the 11 multi-year serials in the Registry once each (as the Registry does) by year of completion, the year with the most films selected is 1939, with 18 films from that year chosen for preservation. The time between a film's debut and its selection varies greatly. The longest span is 119 years, when the 1891 Newark Athlete was selected in 2010. The shortest range is the minimum 10 years; this span is shared by Raging Bull, Do the Right Thing, Goodfellas, Toy Story, and Fargo. Films released prior to 1979 had no opportunity for such a minimum-time selection. In the first year of the registry, Star Wars was the youngest film selected with no other film from the 1970s to be picked.
