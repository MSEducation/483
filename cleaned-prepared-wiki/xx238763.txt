Foreign sponsorship and links to Al-Qaeda

Foreign sponsorship of the Pakistan-based terrorist group has been reported by both Western and other foreign media.  
In May 2007 the London Daily Telegraph reported that President George W. Bush had given the CIA approval to launch covert "black" operations to achieve regime change in Iran. According to this report, the CIA was supplying money and weapons to the Baluchi separatist group named Jundullah.
ABC News, as well as journalist Seymour Hersh have also reported that Jundullah has received support from the United States against Iran.
Other sources also point out that Jundallah is linked to the Pakistani and Saudi Arabian-based al-Qaeda terrorist organization.congresscheck.com/2008/07/10/former-pakistan-general-us-supports-jundullah-terrorists-in-iran/Free Article for Non-Members | STRATFORThe legacy of Nek Mohammed By Syed Saleem Shahzad
