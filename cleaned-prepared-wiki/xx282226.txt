WildChords

Ovelin's first release was WildChords, a guitar learning game that drew inspiration from Guitar Hero, but takes the sound of the user playing a real guitar as the input. Unlike the similar Rocksmith, WildChords uses the iPad's microphone, allowing users to play acoustic guitars as well as electric.

GuitarBots

While promoting WildChords Ovelin discussed their intention to launch a browser version of the app. This eventually appeared in the form of GuitarBots, which adapted the basic design of WildChords to web browsers, but with a different aesthetic and higher difficulty options, along with tutorials, a tuner, and other features.   

GuitarTuna

GuitarTuna is a free guitar tuner app available for iOS, Android, and web browsers. GuitarTuna has been praised for its accuracy,
