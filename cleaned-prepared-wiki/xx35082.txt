Route 42 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey within the Camden area. It runs ) that is directly connected to the Atlantic City Expressway.  Major intersections along the route include the Atlantic City Expressway and the southern terminus of Route 168 in Turnersville, another intersection with Route 168 in Blackwood, and Route 41 and Route 55 in Deptford Township.
Route 42 was originally designated in 1927 to run along the Black Horse Pike between Ferry Avenue in Camden and the present U.S. Route 40/U.S. Route 322 split in the McKee City section of Hamilton Township, Atlantic County. In 1953, the southern terminus was cut back to its current terminus in the Williamstown section of Monroe Township to avoid the concurrency it shared with U.S. Route 322. After the completion of the North–South Freeway between Bellmawr and Turnersville in 1959, Route 42 was moved to this freeway, and the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168. The freeway portion of Route 42 has been improved many times and is projected to see more improvements, including reconstruction of the dangerous and congested interchange with Interstate 76 and Interstate 295 in Bellmawr.

Route description

Black Horse Pike

Route 42 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 322 and County Route 536 Spur in Monroe Township, Gloucester County where it heads to the north on the Black Horse Pike. For the first portion of the route, Route 42 is a divided four–lane arterial highway that intersects various local roads. Some intersections along this section feature jughandles.  There are also many businesses lining the highway. The route crosses County Route 689 (Berlin-Cross Keys Road) and enters  Washington Township. It then intersects the northern terminus of County Route 555 (Tuckahoe Road). After the intersection with County Route 555, Route 42 intersects three more county routes: County Route 655 (Fries Mill Road), County Route 639 (Ganttown Road), and County Route 651 (Greentree Road). The Atlantic City Expressway then starts to the right at an unnumbered intersection, Route 168 continues to the north on the Black Horse Pike, and Route 42 becomes the six–lane North–South Freeway.

North–South Freeway

Following that, the freeway reaches the County Route 673 (College Drive) interchange, serving Camden County College. County Route 534 interchanges with a southbound exit and northbound entrance and then Coles Road interchanges with a northbound exit and southbound entrance. Next, Route 42 encounters Exits 9B and 10A for Route 168. Exit 9B serves northbound Route 168 and provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike, and Exit 10A serves southbound Route 168. County Route 681 interchanges after Route 168, with a southbound exit and northbound entrance, and Route 42 enters Gloucester County again in Deptford Township after crossing the South Branch of Big Timber Creek.
In Deptford Township, Route 41 interchanges with a northbound exit and an entrance in both directions. Past this interchange, County Route 544 interchanges with a southbound exit and an entrance in both directions. Both of these interchanges provide access to the Deptford Mall and, in the case of the Route 41 interchange, to Route 55 from northbound Route 42 since the northbound lanes have no direct access to Route 55. Route 42 meets the northern terminus of the Route 55 freeway at Exit 13 with a southbound exit and northbound entrance then widens to eight lanes. Route 42 crosses the Big Timber Creek into Runnemede, Camden County, where it passes over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange.  The freeway then enters Bellmawr, where it features right-in/right-out ramps with Leaf Avenue, that provide access to County Route 753 (Creek Road).  Route 42 then continues north to its terminus at Interstate 295 where the North–South Freeway becomes Interstate 76, which heads to Camden and Philadelphia .
The North–South Freeway portion of Route 42 is a major route for daily commuters from southern New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania via the Walt Whitman Bridge and Ben Franklin Bridge and weekend commuters from southeastern Pennsylvania to the southern Jersey Shore via Route 55 and the Atlantic City Expressway. "He was pursued back to Haddonfield-Berlin Road, onto Interstate 295, then to Route 42 and onto Route 130, police said."
Snow removal, litter control, and landscaping of Route 42 between the end of the Atlantic City Expressway and Interstate 295 is performed by the South Jersey Transportation Authority.

History

In 1927, Route 42 was legislated to run along the Black Horse Pike, a road that traces its origins back to 1855. In that year, the Camden and Blackwoodstown Turnpike Company was established by entrepreneurs who had helped create the White Horse Pike to build a gravel road that would run from Camden south to Blackwoodtown and eventually to Atlantic City,
The North–South Freeway portion of Route 42 was originally planned as a parkway in 1932 that would run from the Ben Franklin Bridge in Camden to Atlantic City; however, this proposal never materialized.
Following its completion, the North–South Freeway portion of Route 42 has seen many improvements. In 1965, the freeway was widened to six lanes for most of its length with the northernmost part being widened to eight lanes due to the completion of the Atlantic City Expressway and development occurring along the route. The route had its interchange with Route 55 open in 1985, when the Route 55 Freeway was opened from Route 42 to Route 41 to the south. On August 27, 2010, an interchange opened at County Route 673 (College Drive), providing better access to Camden County College.

Future

NJDOT has broken ground on the conspicuously missing express connection between Interstate 295 and Route 42 to finally allow drivers to seamlessly travel from the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and points south to Atlantic City and vice versa.
On May 12, 2009, New Jersey Governor Jon S. Corzine and the Delaware River Port Authority, the agency which manages the PATCO Speedline, announced plans for a Camden-Philadelphia BRT (bus rapid transit system) along the Route 42 freeway and the adjacent Route 55 freeway as part of a comprehensive transportation plan for South Jersey
