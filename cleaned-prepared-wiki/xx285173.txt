By early 2012, several Hollywood studios had presented or were preparing presentations to the author and her agent to obtain film rights to the Fifty Shades trilogy.

Director

By May 9, 2013, the studio was considering Joe Wright to direct,

Casting

James felt casting Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart would be "strange" and "weird".
The studio originally wanted Ryan Gosling for Christian, but he was not interested in the role. Garrett Hedlund was also considered, but he could not connect with the character. Stephen Amell said he would not have wanted to play the role of Grey because "I actually didn't find him to be that interesting ... Nothing about Christian Grey really spoke to me."
In October 2013, actress Jennifer Ehle was in talks for the role of Anastasia's mother Carla. On October 12, 2013, Universal Pictures announced that Hunnam had exited the film due to conflicts with the schedule of his FX series Sons of Anarchy. On December 3, 2013, Marcia Gay Harden was cast as Christian's mother, Grace.

Filming

In September, filming was scheduled to start on November 5, 2013 in Vancouver, British Columbia. The production officially ended on February 21, 2014.com/p/kswln8yke4/

Release

In February 2013, Universal chairman Adam Fogelson told The Hollywood Reporter about the release: "It's conceivable that we could be ready to release it as early as next summer."
The studio initially announced an August 1, 2014, release.

Marketing

On January 25, 2014, Universal debuted the first film posters indicating "Mr. Grey will see you now" in five locations across the United States, more than a year prior the film's release.
