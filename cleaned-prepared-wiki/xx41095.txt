History

The beginnings

Romania's first national airline was founded in 1920 under the name CFRNA - (French-Romanian Company for Air Navigation). The airline used French-built Potez 15 aircraft for its passenger/mail service between Paris and Bucharest via several cities in Central Europe. In 1925, the city of Galaţi became the first destination in Romania served by regular flights followed, from 24 June 1926, by an extended service to Iaşi and Chişinău. Ten de Havilland DH.9 and five Ansaldo A.300, in addition to the Potez aircraft, operated the service. In 1928 the airline changed its name to SNNA - Serviciul Naţional de Navigaţie Aeriană (The National Air Navigation Service). In 1930, the company adopted the name LARES - Liniile Aeriene Române Exploatate de Stat (Romanian Air Line State Run) while 1937 saw the merger of LARES with its competitor, SARTA (Societatea Anonimă Română de Transporturi Aeriene).

Post-World War II

After World War II, when the Soviet Union had extended its influence across Eastern Europe, the airline TARS (Transporturi Aeriene Româno-Sovietice) was established on 8 August 1945, jointly owned by the governments of Romania and the Soviet Union. Domestic operations were started from Bucharest (Băneasa Airport) on 1 February 1946. The company's Soviet share was purchased by Romania and, on 18 September 1954, the airline adopted the name of TAROM - (Transporturi Aeriene Române - Romanian Air Transport). By 1960, TAROM was flying to a dozen cities across Europe. 1966 saw the operation of its first transatlantic flight. On 14 May 1974, it launched a regular service to New York City - (John F. Kennedy International Airport).
Being part of the regional group of airlines within Eastern Bloc states meant that for much of its history TAROM has operated Soviet-designed planes. These included the Li-2, Ilyushin Il-14, Ilyushin Il-18 long-range turboprop, Ilyushin Il-62 long-range jet airliner, Antonov An-24 regional turboprop, and the Tupolev Tu-154 medium-range tri-jet. As was the case with a number of other nations, the Il-62 was the first long-range jet airliner to be put into operation by Romania (1973). Five examples (three Il-62 and two later version Il-62M with a range of 10,000 km) were owned by TAROM, which also leased the planes to other operators.
An exception to Soviet-built planes was made in 1968, when TAROM bought the BAC One Eleven for European and Middle East destinations, and in 1974 when it acquired Boeing 707 aircraft to share its long-haul operations with the Il-62. In 1978, a contract was signed with the UK enabling Rombac to manufacture the BAC One Eleven at Baneasa near Bucharest. Meanwhile, the 707 and Il-62 long-range aircraft were operating New York (via Amsterdam, later London and finally Vienna), Abu-Dhabi-Bangkok-Singapore, and Karachi-Beijing. TAROM was the only Eastern Bloc airline to operate flights to Tel Aviv, Israel.

The 1990s

It was only after the collapse of the Communist Party in 1989 that the airline was able to acquire more Western-built jets. By 1993, TAROM had introduced long-haul flights to Montreal and Bangkok using Ilyushin Il-62 and Airbus A310 aircraft.
During the 1990s, TAROM replaced its long-haul fleet of Boeing 707s and IL-62s with two new A310 aircraft and a third one in lease (the last Il-62 being sold in 1999). In 2001, the airline cancelled its non-profitable long-haul services to Bangkok and Montreal and also terminated services to its remaining intercontinental destinations of Beijing in 2003, Chicago in 2002, and New York City in 2003.
TAROM terminated loss-making domestic services to Craiova, Tulcea, Caransebeş, and Constanţa, and focused its activity on service to key destinations in Europe and the Middle East. 2004 was the first profitable year of the last decade.

2000 onwards

TAROM is recovering from a difficult period that began in the 1990s, when losses of up to $68 million per year were registered, caused by unprofitable routes. At the beginning of the new millennium, the airline initiated a programme that was aimed at restoring profitability. This was achieved by terminating loss-making intercontinental services.
TAROM has decided to focus its operations on Bucharest (Henri Coandă International Airport) (OTP) and Cluj-Napoca International Airport (CLJ), and initiated direct international flights from Sibiu International Airport (SBZ). Codeshare agreements with foreign partner airlines are in place for several international routes.
A fleet upgrade programme started in 2006 with the acquisition of four Airbus A318, three Boeing 737-800, and two ATR 72-500, which resulted in a fleet increase to 26 (2009).
The airline had a frequent-flyer programme "Smart Miles", which was turned into Flying Blue on 5 June 2010.
On 25 June 2010, TAROM joined SkyTeam as the alliance's thirteenth member.
Starting by March 2013, the airline officials are in talks with Airbus, Embraer, Boeing and Mitsubishi to uniform the entire fleet around one turboprop aircraft type and a single type of jet aircraft.

Airline performances

Logo and livery

The TAROM logo, representing a swallow in flight, has been used on all TAROM aircraft since 1954. In the 1970s livery the logo on the tail was painted in red, with a red cheatline. The livery introduced in the early 1990s (on the Airbus A310 aircraft) is a "Eurowhite" scheme with the titles and the tailfin painted in dark blue. Today's color scheme (introduced in 2006 on the A318) is a slightly modified version of the previous one, with an oversized logo on the tailfin, and the engine pods also painted in dark blue.
All aircraft in the TAROM fleet receive a "name" which is a Romanian toponym. For instance, the names of the ATR aircraft in the fleet are related to the rivers of Romania, the Boeing aircraft bear names of Romanian cities, the Airbus long-haul aircraft bear Romanian historical province names, while the new Airbus A318 bear names of Romanian aviation pioneers.
In 2009, marking airline's 55th anniversary, a Boeing 737-700 (YR-BGG "Craiova") was painted in a retro jet colorscheme, representing airline's first livery used in 1950s on Lisunov Li-2 airplanes.

Destinations

The airline operates directly 52 destinations (including charters) in 22 countries (Europe, Middle East and northern Africa) including 10 domestic destinations.

Alliances

In 2006, TAROM was scheduled to join SkyTeam as an associate member (sponsored by Alitalia), but the entry into the alliance was postponed until 2008. On 7 May 2008, SkyTeam signed a SkyTeam Alliance Associate Adherence Agreement (SAAAA) agreement with TAROM, indicating that the airline is on the track to join the alliance as an associate member (sponsored by Air France).
On 22 June 2010, SkyTeam announced that it had renewed its membership program, thereby making TAROM a future full member of the alliance.

Fleet expansion 2006 - 2009

In autumn 2006, TAROM's active fleet counted 16 airplanes (9 Boeing 737 classic & NG and 7 ATR 42-500).
In November and December 2006, TAROM took delivery of its first two Airbus A318-111, becoming the second commercial operator of this type of aircraft in Europe, after Air France. In the fall of 2007, two more Airbus A318 have joined the fleet, bringing the total number of aircraft to four. The Airbus A318 planes are being used on routes from Bucharest to Brussels, Frankfurt, Munich, Paris and Zurich.Airliner World, January 2007
Following airline's decision to cancel its long-haul operations both TAROM's Airbus A310 aircraft were grounded between 2003 and 2007 in Otopeni Airport. In 2008, after reintroducing them to the fleet, TAROM realized their inefficiency and decided to sell them. TAROM Executives stated discussions with Airbus and Boeing are still underway, but 3 Boeing 737-800 have been chosen as replacements and joined the fleet over the course of three months, beginning in November 2008, with the last one being delivered on January 24, 2009.
In order to meet demand on the domestic market, the airline decided to expand its fleet with 2 ATR 72-500 which joined the fleet in the first semester of 2009.
TAROM has announced an intention to standardize its fleet around either the 737 or the A320 series.
The average fleet age of the TAROM fleet is 12.8 years.
