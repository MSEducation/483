San Antonio International Airport  above sea level. SAT is a Class C airport.



In 2011, airport passenger traffic was up 1.7% over 2010. Total enplaned and deplaned passengers was 8,171,824. International passenger traffic increased greatly 33.1% (182,031 passengers) over 2010. This was due in large part to new service launched by Interjet &   VivaAerobus to fill the void left by Mexicana. During 2010, the airport handled 8,034,720 domestic and international passengers.
In 2008, San Antonio International Airport handled 8,358,515 passengers, up 3.5 percent from the 2007 total, making this the airports fourth consecutive year of increasing passenger numbers.  SAT averages 280 daily departures and arrivals at its 27 gates, which serve 16 airlines flying to 31 metro areas, including Mexico City.  The airport's top-ranked destinations are Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Chicago, Baltimore, New York, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta and Washington, D.C.  As of December 2006, Southwest Airlines is the airport's largest passenger air carrier, enplaning 35.24 percent of the airport's total passengers. Delta,  American, and United are the next three largest carriers.
From February to September 2006, the airport was a "focus city" for United Airlines (the airline called it a "hublet") with flights to 12 cities in conjunction with their partner Trans States Airlines.  Trans States Airlines redeployed their aircraft elsewhere, eliminating service to seven cities.  Mexicana celebrated 50 years serving the airport in September 2007, only to suspend service to San Antonio in August 2010 when the airline went bankrupt and suspended operations.
The Airport is undergoing a major, multi-million dollar expansion project which will add new terminals and parking facilities.  The master plan for the project will increase gate capacity to 35.  In addition, construction projects involving Interstate 410 and U.S. Highway 281 have improved access to the airport. (The airport sits near the northeast corner of the I-410/US 281 intersection.) Future plans also call for Stinson Municipal Airport, currently serving general aviation, to become the city's secondary commercial airport.
Airport officials produce a 30-minute news program about once every quarter. "Airport Airwaves" airs on Tuesdays at 9 p.m., Wednesdays at 11 a.m., and Fridays at 1:30 p.m. on the Government-access television (GATV) cable TV channel.
The longest flight (by flight time and distance) from San Antonio International Airport is to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, a distance of , with an average duration of 4 hours 7 minutes. This flight is served by Alaska Airlines, Boeing 737-800.

History

San Antonio International Airport was founded in 1941 when the City of San Antonio purchased  of undeveloped land that, at the time, were north of the city limits (now part of the city's Uptown District) for a project to be called "San Antonio Municipal Airport."  World War II Wartime needs meant the unfinished airport was pressed into federal government service. The airport opened in July 1942 as Alamo Field and was used by the United States Army Air Forces as a training base.
The 77th Reconnaissance Group, equipped with various aircraft (P-39, P-40, A-20, B-25, O-47, O-52, and L-5) trained reconnaissance personnel who later served overseas. One squadron (113th) flew antisubmarine patrols over the Gulf of Mexico.
At the end of the war the airfield was no longer needed by the military and was turned over to the City of San Antonio for civil use.
The former Terminal 2 was built in 1951-53, along with the FAA control tower and a baggage claim area. For HemisFair '68, a new satellite concourse was built, containing eight jet bridge gates and passenger waiting areas.
In 1975 the city adopted its first Airport Master Plan with plans for a new 1,300 space parking garage and a new  FAA Air Traffic Control Tower was built at a new location.
In 1994 a second Airport Master Plan was developed that would take the airport well into the 21st century. This master plan included major updates for the airport. It called for more parking spaces made available through a new 3,000 space parking garage that would be completed by 2007. In addition it had plans for improved airport access, as well as an improved concession program. Two new terminals were planned to replace the aging Terminal 2, to increase the airports gate-capacity to 35.
November 9, 2010 saw the closure of the original Terminal 2, and the opening of the new Terminal B. Terminal 1 was then renamed Terminal A. The removal of fixtures in the old Terminal 2 began in January 2011. The final structural demolition of Terminal 2 took place in May 2011.
San Antonio closed the end of the 20th century with over 3.5 million passenger boardings in 1999. Since 1966, the airport has boarded more than 80 million people.
On August 1, 2012 both terminals of the airport were evacuated due to a bomb threat called from the parking garage. After a search yielded no explosives, the airport reopened.

Management

San Antonio International Airport is owned by the City of San Antonio and operated by the San Antonio Aviation Department.  The aviation director is briefed on a regular basis by Airport Advisory Committee members.  These consist of neighboring communities, pilots, business community, local neighborhoods, taxicab industry and travel and tourism.  This information is then relayed by the Aviation Director to the city council.  Frank Miller was Aviation Director from 2009 to 2011.

Terminals, airlines and destinations

San Antonio International Airport has two terminals with an overall 24 jet bridge gates. The original one-level terminal (formerly Terminal 2) opened in 1953 with ground-loading holding areas and was expanded twice, once in 1959 with new east and west wings and again in 1968 with an eight-gate satellite concourse, which was built to handle visitors to HemisFair '68. Terminal 2 closed on November 9, 2010 as the new Terminal B opened, and Terminal 2 began to be demolished in March 2011, with completion in January 2012. A second terminal (formerly Terminal 1, now Terminal A) opened in 1984  with a 16-gate (Gates A1-A16) concourse. The U.S. Customs Federal Inspection Station (FIS) is located in Terminal A. Gates A1-A2 and A10-A11 have direct access to the FIS. Terminal A will soon begin going through an updating and modernization project.
On November 9, 2010, San Antonio International Airport announced the opening of the brand new Terminal B, which contains 8 gates, (B1-B8). Corgan Associates, Inc. and 3D/International designed the new terminal. After August 1, 2012 all United flights depart and arrive from Terminal B.
A two-level parking garage immediately across from Terminal A opened in 1982, and the five-level parking garage opened in 1999.  An expansion of the five-level parking garage was completed in mid-2008. The FAA control tower became operational in 1986.
Public transportation to and from the airport is provided by VIA Metropolitan Transit Authority's Route 5 bus.
AirTran Airways began new service from San Antonio to Mexico City and Cancún on May 24, 2012.blogsouthwest.com/news/southwest-airlines-announces-new-flights-mexico-operated-airtran-airways, BlogSouthwest, December 5, 2011, Retrieved 2011-12-05

Expansion

An expansion program began in 2006 to add additional parking, two new terminals, and roadway improvements.  The plan calls for the recently renovated Terminal 2 to be razed and replaced by the new terminal. Terminal 1 would then renamed Terminal A, to correspond with Terminal B. Another new terminal, Terminal C, will then be constructed when it is needed. The new Master Plan estimates the design process could begin in 2020. Initial designs for Terminal C called for five gates which could subsequently be expanded to 11 gates as passenger counts require. When Terminal C is completed, it would bring San Antonio's total number of jet-bridge gates to 28. This number will eventually increase to 35 gates as Terminal C is expanded. There are preliminary plans for Terminal D, which could have up to 20 gates, to be built as needed.
On November 9, 2010, Terminal 2 closed, and the new Terminal B was opened. Terminal 1, in turn, assumed the name Terminal A.
The bi-level roadway in front of Terminal 1 (Terminal A) was opened to traffic November 2009 and extended to provide service to the new terminals. A   3,000-space expansion to the existing five-level long-term parking garage was completed in mid-2008. Various ancillary utility projects and upgrades are also being performed as part of this program. To see a map of the construction click here.
