Lincoln Financial Field is the home stadium of the National Football League's Philadelphia Eagles and the Temple Owls football team of Temple University. It has a seating capacity of 68,532 (69,144 with standing room only tickets). It is located in South Philadelphia on Pattison Avenue between 11th and 10th streets, also alongside I-95 as part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.  Many locals refer to the stadium simply as "The Linc".
The stadium opened on August 3, 2003, after two years of construction that began on May 7, 2001, and replaced Veterans Stadium as the Eagles' home stadium. While its total capacity barely changed, the new stadium contains double the number of luxury and wheelchair-accessible seats, along with more modern services. The field's construction included several light emitting diode (LED) video displays, as well as more than  Unlike the Vet, Lincoln Financial Field never had a jail and currently still doesn't have one. The Linc also plays host to several soccer games each year, and in the past (2005, 2006, 2013) it has played host to the NCAA lacrosse national championship.
Naming rights were sold in June 2002 to Lincoln Financial Group, for a sum of $139.6 million over 21 years. Additional construction funding was raised from the sale of Stadium Builder's Licenses to Eagles season ticket holders.
The Army–Navy football game is also played at the stadium. Temple University's Division I college football team also plays their home games at Lincoln Financial Field, paying the Eagles $1 million a year to do so. The Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer also play exhibition games here against high-profile international clubs when their stadium PPL Park does not provide adequate seating.
In late spring of 2013, the Eagles announced that there will be some major upgrades to Lincoln Financial Field over the next 2 years. The total project estimate is valued at over $125 million. The upgrades will include seating expansion, two new HD video boards, upgraded amenities, WiFi, and two new connecting bridges for upper levels. These upgrades were decided upon after research from season ticket holders, advisory boards, and fan focus groups. The majority of these changes, including WiFi (which will accommodate 45,000 users and have coverage over the entire stadium), will be completed by the 2013 home opener. The upgraded sound systems and video boards will be finished by the 2014 season, according to team officials.com
