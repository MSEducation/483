[[Dirichlet character]]

CATEGORIES: Zeta and L-functions

where s is a complex number with real part > 1. By analytic continuation, this function can be extended to a meromorphic function on the whole complex plane. Dirichlet L-functions are generalizations of the Riemann zeta-function and appear prominently in the generalized Riemann hypothesis.
Dirichlet characters are named in honour of Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.

Axiomatic definition

From this definition, several other properties can be deduced.  
By property  3), χ(1)=χ(1×1)=χ(1)χ(1).  Since gcd(1, k) = 1,  property 2) says χ(1) ≠ 0, so 
  χ(1) = 1.  
Properties 3) and 4) show that every Dirichlet character χ is completely multiplicative. 
  If a ≡ b (mod k) then χ(a) = χ(b).   
If gcd(a,k) = 1, Euler's theorem says that aφ(k) ≡ 1 (mod k) (where φ(k) is the totient function).  Therefore by 5) and 4), χ(aφ(k)) = χ(1) = 1, and by 3), χ(aφ(k)) =χ(a)φ(k). So  
  For all a relatively prime to k, χ(a) is a φ(k)-th complex root of unity.  
The unique character of period 1 is called the trivial character. Note that any character vanishes at 0 except the trivial one, which is 1 on all integers. 
A character is called principal if it assumes the value 1 for arguments coprime to its modulus and otherwise is 0.115 A character is called real if it assumes real values only. A character which is not real is called complex.123

Construction via residue classes

Dirichlet characters may be viewed in terms of the character group of the 
unit group of the ring Z/kZ, as extended residue class characters.218

Residue classes

Given an integer k, one defines the residue class of an integer n as the set of all integers congruent to n modulo k:
again denotes Euler's phi function.  
The character group of (Z/k)* consists of the residue class characters.  A residue class character θ on (Z/k)* is primitive if there is no proper divisor d of k such that θ factors as a map (Z/k)* → (Z/d)* → C*.215

Dirichlet characters

The associated character of the multiplicative group (Z/kZ)* is the principal character which always takes the value 1.134
When k is 1, the principal character modulo k is equal to 1 at all integers.  For k greater than 1, the principal character modulo k vanishes at integers having a non-trivial common factor with k and is 1 at other integers.
There are φ(n) Dirichlet characters modulo n.

Examples

If p is an odd prime number, then the function
More generally, if  m is a positive odd number, the function
These are quadratic characters: in general, the primitive quadratic characters arise precisely from the Kronecker symbol.296

Primitive characters and conductor

Residues mod N give rise to residues mod M, for any factor M of N, by discarding some information. The effect on Dirichlet characters goes in the opposite direction: if χ is a character mod M, it induces a character χ* mod N for any multiple N of M.  A character is primitive if it is not induced by any character of smaller modulus.123
If χ is a character mod n and d divides n, then we say that the modulus d is an induced modulus for χ if a coprime to n and 1 mod d implies χ(a)=1:Apostol (1976) p.166 equivalently,  χ(a) =  χ(b) whenever a, b are congruent mod d and each coprime to n.168  A character is primitive if there is no smaller induced modulus.
We can formalise differently this by defining characters χ1 mod N1 and χ2 mod N2 to be co-trained if for some modulus N such that N1 and N2 both divide N we have χ1(n) = χ2(n) for all n coprime to N: that is, there is some character χ* induced by each of χ1 and χ2.  This is an equivalence relation on characters.  A character with the smallest modulus in an equivalence class is primitive and this smallest modulus is the conductor of the characters in the class.  
Imprimitivity of characters can lead to missing Euler factors in their L-functions.

Character orthogonality

The orthogonality relations for characters of a finite group transfer to Dirichlet characters.140  If we fix a character χ modulo n then the sum
unless χ is principal, in which case the sum is φ(n).  Similarly, if we fix a residue class a modulo n and sum over all characters we have

History

Dirichlet characters and their L-series were introduced by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, in 1831, in order to prove Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. He only studied them for real s and especially as s tends to 1. The extension of these functions to complex s in the whole complex plane was obtained by Bernhard Riemann in 1859.
