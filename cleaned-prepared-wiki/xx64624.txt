Stanley Frank "Stan" Musial (; born Stanisław Franciszek Musiał; November 21, 1920 – January 19, 2013) was an American professional baseball player and Navy veteran of World War II. He was a Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder and first baseman on the St. Louis Cardinals for 22 seasons, from 1941 through 1963. Nicknamed "Stan the Man", Musial is widely considered to be one of the greatest hitters in baseball history."Stan Musial: An American Life", Amazon. Retrieved May 18, 2011 He compiled 3,630 career hits, ranking fourth all-time and first in a career spent with only one team. With 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 on the road, he also is considered to be the most consistent hitter of his era. He hit 475 home runs during his career, was named the National League's (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times, and won three World Series championship titles. He shares the MLB record for the most All-Star Games played (24) with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays. Midsummer Classics: Celebrating MLB's All-Star Game.

Retrieved July 21, 2013   He was also selected to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 2014.
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, where he frequently played baseball, whether informally or in organized settings, eventually playing on the baseball team at Donora High School. Signed to a professional contract by the St. Louis Cardinals as a pitcher in 1938, Musial was converted into an outfielder prior to his major league debut in 1941. Noted for his unique batting stance, he quickly established himself as a consistent and productive hitter. In his first full season, 1942, the Cardinals won the World Series. The following year, he led the NL in six different offensive categories and earned his first MVP award. He was also named to the NL All-Star roster for the first time; he would appear in every All-Star game (MLB had two games from 1959 to 1962) in every subsequent season he played. Musial won his second World Series championship in 1944, then missed the entire 1945 season while serving with the United States Navy.
On his return to baseball in 1946, Musial resumed his consistent hitting. That year he earned his second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run shy of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At the time of his retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.

Early life

Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musiał  Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer.Musial and Broeg 1964: 10 When he enrolled in school, his name was formally changed to Stanley Frank Musial.
At age 15 Musial joined the Donora Zincs, a semi-professional team managed by Barbao. Musial also played one season on the newly revived Donora High School baseball team, where one of his teammates was Buddy Griffey, father of MLB player Ken Griffey, Sr. and grandfather to Ken Griffey, Jr.Giglio 2001: 23–24
Musial also played basketball, for which he was offered a scholarship by the University of Pittsburgh. Louis Cardinals had scouted Musial as a pitcher and, in 1937, offered him a professional contract after a workout with their Class D Penn State League affiliate.Giglio 2001: 26–27  Musial also credited his school librarian Helen Kloz for pointing out that baseball was his dream and advising him to pursue it professionally. In what was then a common practice, the Cardinals did not file the contract with the baseball commissioner's office until June 1938. This preserved Musial's amateur eligibility, and he was still able to participate in high school sports, leading Donora High School's basketball team to a playoff appearance.Musial and Broeg 1964: 24–25Giglio 2001: 27–29

Professional baseball career

Minor leagues (1938–1941)

Musial's rookie year with Williamson in 1938 was a period of adjustment both on and off the field. He began gaining more in-depth knowledge about baseball strategyMusial and Broeg 1964: 27–28 while posting a 6–6 win–loss record and a 4.66 earned run average (ERA), to go along with a .258 batting average. Musial finished his high school education before returning to Williamson in spring 1939. That season his numbers improved to a 9–2 record, a 4.30 ERA, and a .352 batting average.Lansche 1994: 12Musial and Broeg 1964: 31
Musial spent the 1940 season with the Cardinals' other Class D team, the Daytona Beach Islanders, where he developed a lifelong friendship with manager Dickie Kerr.Vecsey 2011: 72–74 On May 25, 1940, Musial married fellow Donora resident, Lillian "Lil" Labash, in Daytona Beach, and the couple's first child followed in August.Musial and Broeg 1964: 33–35 For a while Musial considered leaving baseball entirely, complaining that he could not afford to support himself and his wife on the $16 a week pay. Kerr talked him out of it, and even took the Musials into his own home to relieve the financial burden. To repay the debt Musial bought Kerr a $20,000 home in Houston in 1958.311, while compiling an 18–5 pitching record that included 176 strikeouts and 145 walks.Musial and Broeg 1964: 32Lansche 1994: 15
Musial was assigned to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm.Musial and Broeg 1964: 40 During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading .379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as "a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming". According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers think of him as a coiled rattlesnake."Meany, Tom, "Baseball's Greatest Hitters: Stan Musial", Baseball Digest, June 1950, p. 64. Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.Musial and Broeg 1964: 43–44

Major leagues (1941–1944)

Musial made his major league debut during the second game of a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park on September 17, 1941.426 batting average.
Cardinals manager Billy Southworth used Musial as a left fielder to begin 1942, sometimes lifting him for a pinch-hitter against left-handed pitching.315 by late June,Musial and Broeg 1964: 56 as the Cardinals resumed battling the Dodgers for first place in the National League (NL).Lansche 1994: 38 He finished the season with a .315 batting average and 72 runs batted in (RBI) in 140 games. Musial received national publicity when he was named by St. Louis Post-Dispatch sports editor J. Roy Stockton as his choice for Rookie of the Year in a Saturday Evening Post article.Lansche 1994: 40
The Cardinals played the American League champion New York Yankees in the 1942 World Series.Schoor 1990: 188 Musial's first hit of the Series was an RBI single that provided the margin of victory in Game 2, allowing the Cardinals to tie the Series.Schoor 1990: 190 Musial batted .222 for the Series, with two runs scored.Schoor 1990: 403
Musial's 1943 season started with a brief contract holdout in spring training.425), and slugging percentage (.562). After romping to another NL pennant by 18 games, the Cardinals again faced the Yankees in the 1943 World Series. The Cardinals did not win another game in the Series, but the loser's bonus share paid to each Cardinals player ($4,321.99) still amounted to nearly two-thirds of Musial's regular season salary.Giglio 2001: 88
United States involvement in World War II began to impinge on Musial's baseball career in 1944, as he underwent a physical examination in prelude to possible service in the armed forces.347 batting average with 197 hits. Louis's other major league team, the Browns, in the 1944 World Series.250 with zero RBI. The Cardinals went on to defeat the Browns in six games, and Musial posted a .304 batting average for the Series.Giglio 2001: 93–94Schoor 1990: 404

Sojourn in US Navy (1945–1946)

Musial enlisted during World War II and entered the United States Navy on January 23, 1945. He was initially assigned to noncombat duty at the Naval Training Station in Bainbridge, Maryland.Lansche 1994: 67 After being granted emergency leave to see his ailing father in January 1946, he was briefly assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard before his honorable discharge from the Navy as a Seaman Second Class in March 1946.

In 2007, Musial received the Navy Memorial's Lone Sailor Award, which honors Navy veterans who have excelled in civilian life.

Rejoining the Cardinals under new manager Eddie Dyer, Musial posted a .388 batting average by the middle of May 1946.Giglio 2001: 123 During the season, Musial (who was under contract to the Cardinals for $13,500 in 1946) was offered a five-year, $125,000 contract, plus a $50,000 bonus, to join the Mexican League.Lansche 1994: 73
It was also during the 1946 season that Musial acquired his nickname of "The Man". Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bob Broeg heard Dodger fans chanting whenever Musial came to bat, but could not understand the words. Later that day over dinner, Broeg asked Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward if he had understood what the Dodger fans had been chanting. Ward said, "Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'" "'That man,' you mean", Broeg said. "No, the man", replied Ward. Broeg mentioned this story in his Post-Dispatch column, and Musial was thereafter known as Stan "The Man".
In June 1946, Dyer began to use Musial as a first baseman. Musial's Game 1 triple and Game 2 double contributed to the Cardinals' two-games-to-none series victory.Schoor 1990: 207, 405 He won his second MVP Award, receiving 22 out of a possible 24 first-place votes, finishing ahead of Brooklyn's Dixie Walker.Lansche 1994: 84
Musial began the 1947 season by hitting .146 in April. Robert Hyland confirmed a previous diagnosis of appendicitis, while discovering that Musial was concurrently suffering from tonsilitis.Lansche 1994: 89, 93 Despite his health woes, he finished the year with a batting average of .312.Broeg 1981: 116
Fully recovered from his ailments, Musial recorded his 1,000th career hit on April 25, 1948. Louis Globe-Democrat article criticized baseball players for appearing in cigarette advertisements, he made a personal decision to never again appear in such ads.408, prompting Brooklyn pitcher Preacher Roe to comically announce his new method for retiring Musial: "Walk him on four pitches and pick him off first."Lansche 1994: 95–96 Given a mid-season pay raise by new Cardinals owner Robert E. Hannegan for his outstanding performance, Musial hit a home run in the All-Star Game.Lansche 1994: 97

Musial finished 1948 leading the major leagues in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702). If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals, he would have won the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in.Broeg 1981: 121
Anticipating life after his baseball career, Musial began the first of several business partnerships with Julius "Biggie" Garagnani in January 1949, opening "Stan Musial & Biggie's" restaurant.Giglio 2001: 174 His new focus on hitting for power backfired, as pitchers began using the outside part of the plate to induce him to ground out to the first or second baseman. Musial soon stopped focusing on hitting home runs and resumed his consistent offensive production by the end of May. He received his sixth consecutive All-Star player selection and finished the season leading the NL in hits (207) while playing in every game.Giglio 2001: 179
In the late '40s, when baseball was slowly becoming integrated, Musial—along with his roommate Red Schoendienst—would be lauded by newcomers such as Dodgers' pitcher Don Newcombe for their tolerance. "They never..."

=1950–1954=

Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL's number two choice. With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions.Lansche 1994: 116

National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine. Cobb went on to refer to Musial as "a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime." In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, "Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio."
The only major league pitching appearance of Musial's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season. With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner. The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.
The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953, and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city.300.Giglio 2001: 194
Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader. The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972.Lansche 1994: 131

=1955–1959=

Musial made his 12th NL All-Star appearance in 1955 as a reserve player, when Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski outpolled him by 150,000 votes to get on the starting lineup at first base.Lansche 1994: 137 Leading off the bottom of the 12th, he hit a home run to give the NL a 6–5 victory.
The 1956 season marked another milestone for Musial, when he broke Mel Ott's NL record for extra-base hits on August 12.Lansche 1994: 141–143 When Cardinals owner Gussie Busch learned of the possible move, he made it clear that Musial was not available for any trade.Lansche 1994: 143–144
On June 11, 1957, Musial tied the NL record for consecutive games played with his 822nd, a streak that began on the last day of the 1951 season.Lansche 1994: 149 When he overextended his swing while batting during a game on August 23, Musial fractured a bone in his left shoulder socket and tore muscles over his collarbone. He finished 1957 as Sports Illustrated

Musial signed one of the first $100,000 contracts in NL history on January 29, 1958. (According to Baseball Almanac, Hank Greenberg was the first with Pittsburgh in 1947.)Lansche 1994: 155 Approaching the 3,000-hit milestone in his major league career, he expressed a desire to record the hit in St. Louis.Reidenbaugh 1993: 214Lansche 1994: 157–158 The eighth major league player to reach 3,000 hits, and the first to reach the milestone with an extra-base hit, Musial was greeted at St. Louis Union Station that evening by roughly 1,000 fans.Lansche 1994: 162–163
Taking a new approach to preparation for the 1959 season, Musial was given permission to report late to spring training so that he might conserve his energy for the duration of the year.Giglio 2001: 213Lansche 1994: 166 He began the season with one hit in 15 at-bats. Despite his early offensive struggles, he single-handedly spoiled potential no-hitters on April 16 and 19. A game-winning home run on May 7 made him the first major league player ever with 400 home runs and 3,000 hits. As he continued to hit at a relatively low pace, his playing time was limited by Cardinals manager Solly Hemus at various points during the season.Lansche 1994: 168 Musial pinch-hit in both contests, flying out in the July 7 game and drawing a walk in the August 3 game. He finished the season with 115 game appearances, a .255 batting average, 37 runs, and a slugging percentage of .428.
During the 1959 season, John F. Kennedy approached Musial about supporting Kennedy's campaign for President, citing their close ages. Musial campaigned for Kennedy later that year and became a supporter of the Democrat.
On June 30, 1959, Musial was the batter in one of baseball history's oddest plays. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.Musial Is First in History Put Out By 2 Baseballs!

=1960–1963=

Based on his 1959 performance, Musial accepted a pay cut in 1960 from his previous $100,000 salary to $80,000.Musial and Broeg 1964: 211 In June 1960, newspaper articles began speculating that Musial would soon retire, yet he finished the season with a .275 batting average. His .288 batting average that season reaffirmed his decision.330 batting average, good for third in the batting race, with 19 homers and 82 RBI's. As a pinch-hitter, he had 14 base hits in 19 at-bats (.615). That same year, on July 8, the 41-year-old Musial became the oldest player ever to hit three home runs in one game.

The Cardinals began 1963 by winning 10 of their first 15 games, as Musial posted a .237 batting average.277 by the end of the month. Asked by general manager Bing Devine on July 26 what his plans were, Musial decided to retire at season's end.Lansche 1994: 192
Musial became a grandfather for the first time in the early hours of September 11; later that day, he hit a home run in his first at-bat. The Dodgers then swept the Cardinals in a three-game series in St. Louis and clinched the NL pennant on September 25.Lansche 1994: 196  Speakers at the event included baseball commissioner Ford Frick, Cardinals broadcaster Harry Caray, and Cardinals owner Gussie Busch, who announced that Musial's uniform number "6" would be retired by the team. During the game, Musial recorded a single in the fourth inning, then hit a single to right field that scored teammate Curt Flood in the sixth. Cardinals manager Johnny Keane brought in Gary Kolb as a pinch-runner for Musial, bringing his major league career to an end. Just as he had recorded two base hits in his major league debut, Musial finished his last game with two hits, as well. Musial would finish with the all time National League record and second to only Ty Cobb on the all time Major League list. Musial's last hit in his career was hit past the Cincinnati Reds second baseman at the time, Pete Rose, who would later break Cobb's record to become the all time hit king.

At the time of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records.Lansche 1994: 197 He also held NL career marks in categories such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI's (1,951). He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category. Musial would likely have exceeded 500 home runs and become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBIs, had he not served in the military. Musial was also the first major league player to appear in more than 1,000 games at two different positions, registering 1,896 games in the outfield and 1,016 at first base.Lansche 1994: 198
In Musial's 3,026 major league appearances, he was never ejected from a game. He didn't hit in 56 straight games. He married his high school sweetheart and stayed married to her. ... All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."

Post-playing career and family life

Musial was named a vice president of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season.Giglio 2001: 275–278 Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's general manager, and he oversaw the club's World Series championship that year. He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games.Lansche 1994: 199–200 He came to realize that the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte.  He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.
Musial was noted for his harmonica playing, including his rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game".

Honors and recognition

On August 4, 1968, a statue of Musial was erected outside of Busch Memorial Stadium on the northeast grounds of the St. Louis stadium. The statue was moved from its original location to the west side of the new Busch Stadium for its first season in 2006, where it became a popular meeting place for generations of Cardinals fans.O'Neill 2005: 222 Musial's statue is inscribed with a quote attributed to former baseball commissioner Ford Frick: "Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."
Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 
Nearly two decades after Musial retired, baseball statistician Bill James and the sabermetrics movement began providing new ways of comparing players across baseball history. For instance, in his analysis of baseball's under- and overrated players in 2007, sportswriter Jayson Stark said, "I can't think of any all-time great in any sport who gets left out of more who's-the-greatest conversations than Stan Musial."
Musial threw out the first pitch in fifth game of the 2006 World Series and delivered the ceremonial first pitch ball to President Barack Obama at the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. who called him "an icon untarnished, a beloved pillar of the community, a gentleman you'd want your kids to emulate."[ref]Cardinals Hall of Famer Stan Musial Dies at Age 92

On October 17, 2012, Musial made what would be his final appearance at Busch Stadium, riding in a golf cart around the warning track before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. Musial stopped at both dugouts and greeted San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy and Cardinals manager Mike Matheny. The Cardinals would go on to win Game 4 by a score of 8-3, but would lose the pennant to the eventual World Series champion Giants.

Death

Musial died at age 92 of natural causes on January 19, 2013, at his home in Ladue, Missouri, on the same day as fellow MLB Hall of Fame inductee Earl Weaver. Musial was surrounded by his family as he died peacefully. Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt, Jr. released the following statement:

Upon hearing the news of his death, fans gathered and began an impromptu memorial by his statue outside Busch Stadium; the Cardinals issued a release saying the memorial would be left in place for some time.
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon commented: "Stan Musial was a great American hero who—with the utmost humility—inspired us all to aim high and dream big. The world is emptier today without him, but far better to have known him. The legacy of 'baseball's perfect warrior' will endure and inspire generations to come."
St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay tweeted: "Sad as we are, we are fortunate to have had Stan in STL for so long, and are also glad that Stan and Lil are together again." He ordered flags at half-mast in the city.
"Major League Baseball has lost one of its true legends in Stan Musial, a Hall of Famer in every sense and a man who led a great American life," Commissioner Bud Selig said. "He was the heart and soul of the historic St. Louis Cardinals franchise for generations, and he served his country during World War II. A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, Stan's life embodies baseball's unparalleled history and why this game is the national pastime."
Thousands of fans braved cold temperatures on January 24 for a public visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, where Musial lay in state, dressed in his trademark cardinal-red blazer and with a harmonica in his lapel pocket, flanked by a Navy honor guard. A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville's Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial's former parish priest, was the homilist. Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him "the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down", and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial "was a better player than me because he was a better man than me".

Legacy

As a reflection of his popularity Musial has had infrastructure named after him.
In May 2011 the Pennsylvania State Senate changed the name of the bridge that carries the C. Vance Deicas Memorial Highway (S.R. 1077) over the Monongahela River from Donora-Monessen Bridge to Stan Musial Bridge after Musial who was a native of the area.
In October 2013 the St Louis Fire Department started operating a fireboat named after Musial.
In July 2013, the new Interstate 70 bridge over the Mississippi River in St. Louis received the official name of "Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge"
