[[2010s in fashion]]

CATEGORIES: 2010s fashion

The 2010s (2010–present) have thus far been defined by a revival of austerity era period pieces, 1980s neon colors, and unisex early 1990s styles influenced by grunge and skater fashions.1980s style Baseball jacket In the early 2010s, many mid and late 2000s fashions remained popular in Europe, the United States, Latin America, Australia and East Asia, especially the indie pop look which largely drew upon 1960s Mod clothing combined with elements of 1970s garage rock and contemporary alternative fashion. Latin American teens and young adults, who started keeping up with general Western fashion more closely since the mid-1990s, proved to be more conservative upon maintaining or abandoning 2000s trends than their European and North American peers until about 2013.
