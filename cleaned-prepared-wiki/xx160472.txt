Founded in 1869, the Historical Society of Berks County (HSBC) is a museum and library located in Reading, Pennsylvania.  The Society's mission, as described on its website, is "to focus attention on the unique local history, the vast material culture, and the diverse cultural heritage of Berks County by preserving, archiving, and promoting this material to instill in our citizens of all ages and ethnic groups an awareness of this growing treasure trove of information. This allows the HSBC to be a major cultural magnet, drawing people to our community."  
The Historical Society houses materials relating to the early history of Berks County in its Museum, in the Henry Janssen Library, and at the historic Hendel House. Over 10,000 members and patrons visit during the year.  The Society educates students from public and private schools in the area and is visited by researchers from all over the country.

Hendel House

The Historical Society of Berks County's Hendel House, donated by Marjorie Hendel-Perfect, is at 746 Centre Ave, Reading, PA. The northern end of the structure dates from 1877. Mrs. Perfect "gave" the mansion to preserve it for posterity in honor of her father who erected the 1897 addition and transformed the structure into an elegant residence. Adelaide K. Hendel was the last of the Hendels to live here. From 1949 to 1999 it was used as a Lutheran church. Following restoration, this adjunct facility will be used for Society-related functions, meetings of various kinds, some office space, and storage.
The Hendel House is open the second Saturday of every month from noon to 4PM except January, July and August, and by appointment.  The Hendel House is also available for private functions by arrangement with the Historical Society.

History

In July 1869, a call was made for interested citizens to gather "for the purpose of collecting and perpetuating the historical reminisces of Berks County."  Following the first meeting in August, the Historical Society of Berks County was incorporated on December 13, 1869.  The first president was the Honorable William M. Hiester.  After a period of stagnation, President Albert G. Green revived the Society in 1898.  Meetings were held in the Exchange Building located on North 6th Street in Reading, PA.  The first female member was Kate E. Hawley, wife of Reading Eagle founder Jesse G. Hawley, a charter member.
The Historical Society first started collecting objects in June, 1898.  Its first building, purchased in June 1904 from the Reading Gas Company, was located at 519 Court Street.  At that time, membership was 150.  Less than ten years later, the burgeoning Historical Society needed a larger building, and J. Bennett Nolan led the search for a new structure.  The cornerstone for the present building was laid in the summer of 1928, and construction was completed the following year. Designed by architect Charles H. Muhlenberg of Muhlenberg Brothers, to be a fireproof structure to house the collection and archives, it is made of concrete and brick.  The present facility was dedicated on October 1, 1929. It is located at 
Needing more office, display, and storage space, the Historical Society embarked on a fund raising campaign in the 1980s.  The new building addition was opened in 1988, providing the library with its own dedicated storage and research space.  
Again faced with storage concerns, the Historical Society took possession of its first off-site property in 2000.  Known as the Hendel House, it is located directly across from Centre Park at 746 Centre Avenue, the ornate Victorian structure is used for meetings, programs, and object storage.  
In 2005, the Historical Society purchased the former M&T Bank building at 160 Spring Street, directly behind the main building located at 940 Centre Avenue.  Formally named The Henry Janssen Library, this premier research facility opened to the public on November 11, 2008 after extensive renovations.
