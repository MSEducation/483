Yothu Yindi (Yolngu for "child and mother") are an Australian musical group with Aboriginal and balanda (non-Aboriginal) members formed in 1986. Aboriginal members come from Yolngu homelands near Yirrkala on the Gove Peninsula in Northern Territory's Arnhem Land. Founding members included Stuart Kellaway on bass guitar, Cal Williams on lead guitar, Andrew Belletty (Drums),Witiyana Marika on manikay (traditional vocals), bilma (ironwood clapsticks) and dance, Milkayngu Mununggurr on yidaki (didgeridoo), Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu on keyboards, guitar and percussion, and leader Mandawuy Yunupingu on vocals and guitar.
The band combines aspects of both musical cultures, their sound varies from traditional Aboriginal songs to modern pop and rock songs, where they blend the typical instruments associated with pop/rock bands, such as guitars and drums, with the traditional yidaki and bilma. They have adapted traditional Yolngu dance performances to accompany their music, more broadly they promote mutual respect and understanding in the coming together of different cultures. Yothu Yindi's most widely known song "Treaty" peaked at No. 11 on the ARIA singles charts in 1991 and the related album Tribal Voice peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA albums charts. The second single from Tribal Voice was "Djäpana (Sunset Dreaming)" which peaked at No. 13 in 1992. Their debut album was Homeland Movement in 1988 on Mushroom Records, other albums are Tribal Voice in 1991, Freedom in 1993, Birrkuta - Wild Honey in 1996, One Blood in 1998 and Garma in 2000.
The group helped established the Yothu Yindi Foundation in 1990 to promote Yolngu cultural development, including from 1999 producing the annual Garma Festival of Traditional Cultures and as from May 2007 running the Dilthan Yolngunha (Healing Place). Chairman of the foundation is Galarrwuy Yunupingu. He is Mandawuy's older brother, a Yolgnu clan leader and sometimes a member of Yothu Yindi on bilma and guitar. Galarrwuy had been named Australian of the Year in 1978 for his work for Aboriginal communities and Mandawuy was Australian of the Year for 1992 for his work with Yothu Yindi. In December 2012, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) inducted the band into the ARIA Hall of Fame, as part of the ARIA Music Awards of 2012.

Early years: 1986–1990

Swamp Jockeys was formed in 1985 by balanda (European/non-Aboriginal people) Andrew Belletty on drums, Stuart Kellaway on bass guitar and Cal Williams on lead guitar on their tour of Arnhem Land in Australia's Northern Territory. They were supported by a Yolngu band composed of Witiyana Marika on manikay (traditional vocals), bilma (ironwood clapsticks) and dance, Milkayngu Mununggurr on yidaki (didgeridoo), Gurrumul 'The Guru' Yunupingu on keyboards, guitar and percussion, and Mandawuy Yunupingu (born Bakamana Yunupingu) on vocals and guitar. They united to form Yothu Yindi (pronounced 'yo-thoo yin-dee'), yothu yindi is a Yolngu matha (Yolngu language) kinship term for "child and mother". The band combines aspects of both musical cultures. Their sound varies from traditional Aboriginal songs to modern pop and rock songs in which they blend the typical instruments of pop/rock bands, such as guitars and drums, with the traditional yidaki and bilma. They have adapted traditional Yolngu dance performances to accompany their music. More broadly they promote mutual respect and understanding of different cultures.
Mandawuy Yunupingu was a tertiary student studying to become a teacher. He became principal at his own Yirrkala Community School, and touring by Yothu Yindi was restricted to school holidays in the band's early years. In August 1988 they performed in Townsville, Queensland, at the South Pacific Festival of Arts. The next month they represented Australia in Seoul, South Korea at the Cultural Olympics. Bart Willoughby (ex-No Fixed Address, Coloured Stone) joined on drums in late 1988 and Yothu Yindi toured USA and Canada as support act to Midnight Oil. Upon their return to Australia, they were signed to Mushroom Records, and with Leszek Karski (ex-Supercharge) producing, recorded their debut single "Mainstream", released in March 1989. It was followed by debut album Homeland Movement in May; a second single "Djäpana (Sunset Dreaming)" was released in August. Neither their singles nor album had any major chart success. Yothu Yindi toured with Neil Young in Australia, then head-lined in Papua New Guinea and Hong Kong. In 1990 they toured New Zealand with Tracy Chapman, and then performed in festivals in the UK. In 1990 five clans of the Yolngu formed the Yothu Yindi Foundation to promote Yulngu cultural development. Chairman of the foundation is Galarrwuy Yunupingu, Mandawuy's older brother, a Yolngu clan leader and sometimes a member of Yothu Yindi on bilma and guitar. Galarrwuy had been named Australian of the Year in 1978 for his work for Aboriginal communities.

"Treaty" and Tribal Voice: 1991–1992

In 1988, as part of Bicentennial celebrations, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke visited the Northern Territory for the Barunga festival where he was presented with a statement of Aboriginal political objectives by Galarrwuy Yunupingu and Wenten Rubuntja. Hawke responded to the Barunga Statement with a promise that a treaty would be concluded with Indigenous Australians by 1990. By 1991, Yothu Yindi were Hughie Benjamin on drums, Sophie Garrkali and Julie Gungunbuy as dancers, Kellaway, Marika, Mununggurr, Gurrumul Yunupingu, Makuma Yunupingu on yidaki, vocals, bilma, Mandawuy Yunupingu, Mangatjay Yunupingu as a dancer. Mandawuy, with his older brother Galarrwuy, wanted a song to highlight the lack of progress on the treaty between Aboriginal peoples and the federal government. Mandawuy recalls:

"Treaty" was written by Australian musician Paul Kelly and Yothu Yindi members Mandawuy Yunupingu, Kellaway, Williams, Gurrumul Yunupingu, Mununggurr and Marika. The initial release had little interest, but Melbourne-based dance remixers Filthy Lucre's Robert Goodge (ex-I'm Talking) and Gavin Campbell adapted the song, their version peaked at No. 11 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) singles charts by September. The song contains lyrics in both English and in Yolngu matha, it was accompanied by a video showing band members performing vocals, music, and dance.
Success for the single was transferred to the related album Tribal Voice which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA albums charts, The album produced by Mark Moffatt for Mushroom Records was released in September 1991. Mandawuy Yunupingu took leave of absence from his duties as principal to tour and promote the single and album. Other singles from the album were a re-released "Djäpana (Sunset Dreaming)" which peaked at No. 13 in 1992 and "Tribal Voice" which didn't reach the Top 50. At the 1992 ARIA Awards Yothu Yindi won awards for 'Best Cover Art' for Tribal Voice by Louise Beach and Mushroom Art; 'Engineer of the Year' for "Maralitja" (maralitja is Yolngu matha for crocodile man - one of Mandawuy's tribal names), "Dharpa" (dharpa is tree), "Treaty", "Treaty (Filthy Lucre remix)" and "Tribal Voice" by David Price, Ted Howard, Greg Henderson and Simon Polinski; 'Best Indigenous Release' for Tribal Voice; 'Song of the Year' for "Treaty"; and 'Single of the Year' for "Treaty".
In October 1992, then Prime Minister Paul Keating's government awarded Yothu Yindi with a $30,000 grant. The money was used to travel to New York, where they performed at the United Nations for the launch of International Year for the World's Indigenous People. Mandawuy Yunupingu was named Australian of the Year by the Keating government on 26 January 1993. His older brother, Galarrwuy had been named Australian of the Year in 1978 for his work for Aboriginal communities.
In 2009 'Treaty' was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia Registry.

After intense touring in 1994, Williams left Yothu Yindi and was replaced by Colin Simpson on guitar, they added Ben Hakalitz (ex-Not Drowning Waving) on drums and Baruka Tau-Matagu on keyboards. Gurrumul Yunupingu had left by 1995 to live full-time on Elcho Island, he later formed Salt Water Band to record three albums, and in 2007 released his self-titled solo album. Yothu Yindi's fourth album Birrkuta (birrkuta means wild honey) was released in August 1996.
"I Am Australian" is a popular song written in 1987 by Dobe Newton of The Bushwackers and Bruce Woodley of The Seekers.

They sponsored the Yothu Yindi Foundation, which produces the annual Garma Festival of Traditional Cultures celebrating Yolngu culture from 1999, and their sixth album Garma was released in 2000, with Cal Williams returning on guitars. Gavin is the son of Galarrwuy and nephew of Mandawuy.
In May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, named "Treaty" as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time.
In 2009, News.au reported that Yothu Yindi lead singer Mandawuy Yunupingu needed a kidney transplant due to chronic alcoholism. Yunupingu said he drank up to four cartons of alcohol a day. "Alcohol was a big influence in my life. I didn't know what harm it did to my body. Before I knew, it was too late," he said. 
In December 2012 Yothu Yindi were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame, with Peter Garrett (former member of Midnight Oil) and Paul Kelly introducing the group.
