Kinfolk Magazine is an independent quarterly entertainment and lifestyle magazine based out of Portland, Oregon, founded in 2011.

The Magazine

Kinfolk was created by Nathan Williams and a group of friends, the first edition being issued in July 2011.
In addition to their print publication, Kinfolk is also known for their 'Community Gathering' event series that takes place globally each month, and also have begun producing international food-based workshops, cookbooks and a short film series.
Released quarterly, Kinfolk published four 144-page, advertisement-free issues a year. Each issue is themed around a topic that is related to the season it is being published in, with all food, entertaining and lifestyle content geared towards that theme.
The writers, photographers, designers and chefs that contribute to Kinfolk are drawn from a largely international pool of creatives, often numbering over 50 individual contributors an issue.
The magazine has been consistently praised for its clean design and photographic aesthetic.

International ties

In addition to their American readership, Kinfolk also has a growing international following, leading to the magazine being also translated and published into Japanese, Russian and Korean, and their digital realm also existing in an entirely Japanese portal.

Community Gatherings

Starting in 2012, Kinfolk began orchestrating different event series around the world. They have now grown to having up to 30 international events every month based on a seasonal theme, such as flower potlucks, butcher's block parties and campfire cooking.
