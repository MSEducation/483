History

Hollyhock was originally founded by Rex Weyler and 30 friends and colleagues from Greenpeace and the Humanistic Psychology Association in 1982. They purchased the abandoned Cold Mountain Institute—a former learning centre known for its Gestalt therapy practices. Eventually all of the 30 founders donated their shares of the property and in 2010, Hollyhock's Leadership Institute became a registered charity.
