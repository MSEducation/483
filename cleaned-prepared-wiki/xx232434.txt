Career in film, writing, and poetry

Child began making films in 1970s, producing seven independent documentaries shot on 16mm. From the middle of the 70s she turned to experimental montage and in the 80s her work explores gender and strategies for remaking narrative.
In the 21st century, Child's film and video has explored history, memory, and cultural experiencesâ€”the politics of place and identity.  Digital works like Cake + Steak (2004) and The Future Is Behind You (2005) investigate the awkward drama of the everyday, often utilizing found material to examine the past. MirrorWorld (2007) is a multi-screen installation that incorporates parts of Child's "foreign film" series to explore narrative excess.  Key works include Surface Noise (2000), Dark Dark(2001), Where The Girls Are (2002), Cake and Steak (2004), The Future Is Behind You (2004), To and No Fro (2005), andMirror World (2006). Her feature video documentary On The Downlow (2007)), is an exploration of bisexuality and an intimate look at a little viewed underground scene.
In 2012, Child completed a feature film, Shape of Error, an imaginary "home movie"  based on the diaries of Mary Shelley during her marriage with Percy Shelley.
Child is also the author of five books of poetry (published between 1983 and 2012)  and a book of critical writings: This Is Called Moving: A Critical Poetics of Film (2005).
