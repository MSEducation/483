History

Air France–KLM was created by the mutually agreed merger between Air France and Netherlands-based KLM on 5 May 2004.
As a result of the deal, the French government's share of Air France was reduced from 54.4% (of the former Air France) to 44% (of the combined airline). Its share was subsequently reduced to 25%, and later to 18.6%.
At the time of the merger in May 2004, Air France and KLM combined offered flights to 225 destinations in the world. In the year ending 21 March 2003, the two companies combined transported 66.3 million passengers.
In October 2005, Air France Cargo and KLM Cargo, the two freight subsidiaries of the group, announced a merge of their commercial activities. The Joint Cargo Management Team now operates the organisation worldwide from the Netherlands.
In a 2007 opening for a majority takeover of the loss-generating Alitalia, Air France–KLM was one of three bidders, and was favoured by the board of Alitalia."Alitalia favors Air France–KLM bid."

Potential negotiations with Japan Airlines

Air France–KLM, along with its partner Delta Air Lines, were in talks about investing with Japan Airlines, which is part of the Oneworld alliance (rival to SkyTeam) but is experiencing financial problems. Air France–KLM, along with Delta and Delta's rival American Airlines (AMR Corporation; part of Oneworld) discussed investments for a sum of $200–300 million to help the financially struggling carrier, which is Asia's largest airline by revenue. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan had recommended Air France–KLM and/or Delta for being partners because of their "healthy" financial status compared to AMR Corporation. Delta was also recommended because of its extensive Asian network acquired through the acquisition of Northwest Airlines; Korean Air, also a SkyTeam member, was also in talks with JAL on the negotiations. Air France, Alitalia, China Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Korean Air, and Vietnam Airlines are SkyTeam members that currently have codesharing with JAL.
On 7 February 2010 several news outlets reported that JAL will decide to keep its alliance with American Airlines and end talks with Delta. New JAL CEO Inamori and ETIC officials, according to the reports, decided that switching alliances (from Oneworld to SkyTeam) would be too risky and could hinder JAL's ability to turn around the airline quickly.
On 9 February 2010 JAL officially announced their decision to strengthen its partnership with American, which includes the joint application of antitrust immunity approval on transpacific routes. The airline will also fortify its relationship with other partners in the Oneworld alliance.

Financial details

In May 2010, Air France–KLM announced increased losses (€1.56 billion for the year to 31 March 2010), and warned that the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull had caused a further €160 million loss in the current financial year.
Air France–KLM is one of the largest airline companies in Europe, with 204.7 billion passenger-km in the year ending 31 March 2011.
Private shareholders own 81.4% of the company with 37% held by former Air France shareholders and 21% held by former KLM shareholders. The Government of France owns the remaining 18.6%.
In June 2008, Air France–KLM agreed to pay $350 million to settle charges of cargo price fixing in an investigation conducted by the U.S. Justice Department. Cathay Pacific, Martinair Holland, and SAS Cargo Group also agreed to fines bringing the total to $504 million.NPR: NPR News In Brief
The company spends about a third of its revenue on staff, its biggest expense, while Lufthansa only spends around a quarter, so to save around 800 million euros (app. 1.04 billion US$) annually over the next three years, the company will make a recruitment freeze which will lead to 2,000 job cuts in 2012.
In February 2014, Air-France KLM announced it would invest $100 million in Brazilian airline Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in advance of the 2014 football World Cup.
