Methiopropamine (MPA) is a thiophene ring-based structural analog of methamphetamine originally reported in 1942.

Pharmacology

Methiopropamine functions as a selective norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor that is approximately 1.85 times more selective for norepinephrine than dopamine. It is approximately one third as potent as dextroamphetamine as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and one fifth as much as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It displays negligible activity as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

Metabolism

For N-alkyl amphetamines deamination and N-dealkylation are the major elimination pathways and renal excretion is a minor one. 
Methiopropamine is metabolized into active thiopropamine, 4-hydroxymethiopropamine and thiophene S-oxides.
Thiophene-2-carboxylic acid should be the final major metabolic product. It is very hydrophilic and is excreted in urine. Methiopropamine and especially thiopropamine are also excreted renally, unchanged.

Synthesis

There is a four step synthesis of methiopropamine.  It begins with (thiophen-2-yl)magnesium bromide, which is reacted with propylene oxide, yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-hydroxypropane which is reacted with phosphorus tribromide, yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-bromopropane which is finally reacted with methylamine, yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-methylaminopropane.

Legality

Methiopropamine is not explictly a controlled substance, however its legal status under the Federal Analog Act is not certain. It may be considered an analog of methamphetamine for legal purposes, although its structure differs more than previous successful prosecutions under the same law. It is explicitly illegal in the state of Florida and in Germany.
