The U.S. National Academy of Sciences, both in its 2002 report to President George W. Bush, and in later publications, has strongly endorsed evidence of an average global temperature increase in the 20th century.
The preliminary results of an assessment carried out by the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group and made public in October 2011, found that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911°C, and their results mirrors those obtained from earlier studies carried out by the NOAA, the Hadley Centre and NASA's GISS.  The study addressed concerns raised by "skeptics"[ref]see also:

. "(...) The 1990s is the real appearance of the science skeptics.  How much did they come after you? I actually don't like the word "skeptics" for them; I think it's better to call them "contrarians," because skepticism is part of science; all scientists are skeptics (...)"

=Internal climate variability and global warming=

One of the issues that has been raised in the media is the view that global warming "stopped in 1998".g., see

This view ignores the presence of internal climate variability. Internal climate variability is a result of complex interactions between components of the climate system, such as the coupling between the atmosphere and ocean. An example of internal climate variability is the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The El Niño in 1998 was particularly strong, possibly one of the strongest of the 20th century.
Cooling between 2006 and 2008, for instance, has likely been driven by La Niña, the opposite of El Niño conditions.[ref]Edited quote from public-domain source: 

[/ref] The area of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures that defines La Niña conditions can push global temperatures downward, if the phenomenon is strong enough. Even accounting for the presence of internal climate variability, recent years rank among the warmest on record.[ref]Edited quote from public-domain source:

Spatial variability

The global temperature changes are not uniform over the globe, nor would they be expected to be, whether the changes were naturally or humanly forced.
Temperature trends from 1901 are positive over most of the world's surface except for Atlantic Ocean south of Greenland, the south-eastern USA and parts of Bolivia. Warming is strongest over interior land area in Asia and North America as well as south-eastern Brazil and some area in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
Since 1979 temperatures increase is considerably stronger over land while cooling has been observed over some oceanic regions in the Pacific Ocean and Southern Hemisphere, the spatial pattern of ocean temperature trend in those regions is possibly related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode.
Seasonal temperature trends are positive over most of the globe but weak cooling is observed over the mid latitudes of the southern ocean but also over eastern Canada in spring due to strengthening of the North Atlantic Oscillation, warming is stronger over northern Europe, China and North America in winter, Europe and Asia interior in spring, Europe and north Africa in summer and northern North America, Greenland and Eastern Asia in autumn.
Enhanced warming over north Eurasia is partly linked to the Northern Annular Mode,
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by 2.5 °C (4.5 °F) in the past five decades at Bellingshausen Station.

Uncertainties in the temperature record

Systematic local biases in surface temperature trends may exist due to changes in station exposure and instrumentation over land, or changes in measurement techniques by ships and buoys in the ocean. It is likely that these biases are largely random and therefore cancel out over large regions such as the globe or tropics.
Some have expressed concern that land temperature data might be biased due to urbanization effects (see urban heat island effect for more information). Studies specifically designed to identify systematic problems using a range of approaches have found no detectable urban influence in large-area averages in the data sets that have been adjusted to remove non-climatic influences (i.e., "homogenized")., O.

The uncertainty in annual measurements of the global average temperature (95% range) is estimated to be ≈0.05°C since 1950 and as much as ≈0.15°C in the earliest portions of the instrumental record. The error in recent years is dominated by the incomplete coverage of existing temperature records. Early records also have a substantial uncertainty driven by systematic concerns over the accuracy of sea surface temperature measurements. A temperature drop of about 0.3 °C in 1945 could be the result of uncorrected instrumental biases in the sea surface temperature record.
Station densities are highest in the northern hemisphere, providing more confidence in climate trends in this region. Station densities are far lower in other regions such as the tropics, northern Asia and the former Soviet Union. This results in less confidence in the robustness of climate trends in these areas. If a region with few stations includes a poor quality station, the impact on global temperature would be greater than in a grid with many weather stations.
As stated, uncertainties in the instrumental record do not undermine the robust finding of an observed long-term increase in global mean temperature, which is supported by a wide range of evidence.
A number of scientists and scientific organizations have expressed concern about the possible deterioration of the land surface observing network. Pielke has stated that he has identified a number of sites where poorly sited stations in sparse regions "will introduce spatially unrepresentative data into the analyses."Climate Science: Roger Pielke Sr. Research Group Weblog University of Alabama-Huntsville professor of atmospheric science and former IPCC lead author John Christy has stated that "the temperature records cannot be relied on as indicators of global change."The Sunday Times, February 14, 2010
The metadata needed to quantify the uncertainty from poorly sited stations does not currently exist. Pielke has called for a similar documentation effort for the rest of the world. Research Group Weblog

Evaluation of the United States land surface temperature record

In 1999 a panel of the U.S. National Research Council studied the state of US climate observing systems. 1995. Land surface temperature had "known serious deficiencies" in 5 principles, vertical distribution and sea surface in 9 and subsurface ocean in 7.
The U.S. National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program has established minimum standards regarding the instrumentation, siting, and reporting of surface temperature stations.Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere: Steps for Understanding and Reconciling Differences. Thomas R. Karl, Susan J. Hassol, Christopher D. Miller, and William L. Murray, editors, 2006. A Report by the Climate Change Science Program and the Subcommittee on Global Change Research, Washington, DC. These stations can undergo undocumented changes such as relocation, changes in instrumentation and exposure (including changes in nearby thermally emitting structures), changes in land use (e.g., urbanization), and changes in observation practices. All of these changes can introduce biases into the stations' long term records. In the past, these local biases were generally considered to be random and therefore would cancel each other out using many stations and the ocean record.
A 2006 paper analyzed a subset of U.S. surface stations, 366 stations, and found that 95% displayed a warming trend after land use/land cover (LULC) changes. The authors stated "this does not necessarily imply that the LULC changes are the causative factor."Land use/land cover change effects on temperature trends at U.S. Climate Normals stations Another study  has documented examples of well and poorly sited monitoring stations in the United States, including ones near buildings, roadways, and air conditioning exhausts. Brooks investigated Historical Climate Network (USHCN) sites in Indiana, and assigned 16% of the sites an 'excellent' rating, 59% a 'good' rating, 12.5% a 'fair' rating, and 12.5% 'poor' rating. They stated that some of the sites "are not at all representative of their surrounding region" and should be replaced in the instrumental temperature records with other sites from the U.S. cooperative observer network.Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society Volume 86 Number 4 April 2005
Peterson has argued that existing empirical techniques for validating the local and regional consistency of temperature data are adequate to identify and remove biases from station records, and that such corrections allow information about long-term trends to be preserved.Documentation of Uncertainties and Biases Associated with Surface Temperature Measurement Sites for Climate Change Assessment Pielke et alia.

Warmest years

The list of hottest years on record is dominated by years from this millennium; each of the last 12 years (2001–2012) features as one of the 14 warmest on record. Global temperatures are affected by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with the extremes of El Niño and La Niña leading respectively to unusually warm and cool years. 2010 as an El Niño topped the previous record set in the El Niño year of 1998. While 2012 as an La Niña year was cooler, it was still the 10th warmest year since records began in 1880. Over the more recent record, 2006 and 2009 are tied for the warmest "La Niña year" in the period from 1971 to 2012.
Although the NCDC temperature record begins in 1880, less certain reconstructions of earlier temperatures suggest these years may be the warmest for several centuries to millennia.
