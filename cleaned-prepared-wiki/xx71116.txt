Presidents

2006 Spotted Tail wildfire

In late July 2006, the college was in danger of damage from a wildfire. The Spotted Tail fire was caused by a lightning strike July 26 about seven miles (11Â km) south of Chadron. By July 28, the wildfire, fueled by dry grass and winds, reached the edge of Chadron and the college campus. Fire crews prevented the wildfire from reaching the campus. The pine ridge escarpment south of the college, including C-Hill, was blackened as a result of the fire.
