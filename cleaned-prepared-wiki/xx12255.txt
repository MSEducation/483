When worn together the pair of swords were called daishō, which translates literally as "big-little".68 The katana was the big or long sword and the wakizashi the companion sword.

W. Norton & Company, 2001 P.240 and sometimes to commit ritual suicide.A glossary of the construction, decoration and use of arms and armor in all countries and in all times, together with some closely related subjects, George Cameron Stone, Jack Brussel Pub., 1961 P.201 The wakizashi was one of several short swords available for use by samurai including the  yoroi tōshi, the chisa-katana and the tantō. The term wakizashi did not originally specify swords of any official blade lengthHandbook to life in medieval and early modern Japan, William E. Deal, Oxford University Press US, 2007 P.158 and was an abbreviation of "wakizashi no katana" ("sword thrust at one's side"); the term was applied to companion swords of all sizes. Friday, Psychology Press, 2004 P.78 It was not until the Edo period in 1638 when the rulers of Japan tried to regulate the types of swords and the social groups which were allowed to wear them that the lengths of katana and wakizashi were officially set.35
Kanzan Satō, in his book titled "The Japanese Sword", notes that there did not seem to be any particular need for the wakizashi and suggests that the wakizashi may have become more popular than the tanto due to the wakizashi being more suited for indoor fighting.  He mentions the custom of leaving the katana at the door of a castle or palace when entering while continuing to wear the wakizashi inside.68   
While the wearing of katana was limited to the samurai class, wakizashi of legal length (ko-wakizashi) could be carried by the chonin class which included merchants. This was common when traveling due to the risk of encountering bandits.28 Wakizashi were worn on the left side, secured to the waist sash (Uwa-obi or himo).260
