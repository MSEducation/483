K-Meleon is a web browser for the Microsoft Windows platform. Based on the same Gecko layout engine as Mozilla Firefox, K-Meleon uses native Windows application programming interface (API) to create the user interface, instead of using Mozilla's cross-platform XML User Interface Language (XUL) layer, and as a result, is tightly integrated into the look and feel of the Windows desktop; this approach is similar to that of Galeon and Epiphany (for the GNOME desktop), and Camino (for Mac OS X). This also makes K-Meleon less resource-intensive.

Development and specifications

K-Meleon is released under the GNU General Public License and runs on the Win32 platform. The current release version of K-Meleon is 1.5.4, which was released on March 5, 2010. This release is based on the Gecko 1.8.1.24pre rendering engine.
K-Meleon's very first version was originally written by Christophe Thibault and released to the public on August 21, 2000.
The change from the K-Meleon 0.9.x series to 1.0.x was a major modification. The most notable change was the main K-Meleon code being updated to accommodate the Gecko 1.8.0.x rendering engine, as used in the latest releases of SeaMonkey and Mozilla Firefox. The change of layout not only brought the browser up-to-date on the level of security, but on web page layout as well. Several other major improvements included support for favicons and multi-user environments. Some themes and macros from version 0.9 are still compatible with 1.0, although the macro system has been updated. An even more fundamental update of the macro system was made concurrent with the development of K-Meleon 1.1, has been made that is based on a current "k-meleon.8.0.x Gecko rendering engine to allow people who prefer the older K-Meleon 0.9 interface to update their browsing to current security standards.
K-Meleon saw another big development step with the release of 1.5.x. With this version, the layers plug-in became obsolete and was replaced with built-in tabs. This was the first time real tabs were implemented in an official build. Various other features and improvements were added along the line of the 1.5.x. series.
K-Meleon was one of the twelve browsers offered to European Economic Area users of Microsoft Windows in 2010.BBC, Microsoft offers browser choices to Europeans, 1 March 2010
As of 2012, the project was incorrectly reported as being on indefinite hold, supposedly for the reason that Mozilla was no longer providing an embeddable version of the gecko engine.  See here  
In late 2013 the K-Meleon group began developing new versions based on Mozilla's XULrunner 25 runtime environment in place of the Gecko environment.  The most recent release is code named "KM74." Another recent development version named K-Meleon Twin is also available. Whilst these are still development versions they are, for the most part, fully functioning. Download links can be found in the K-Meleon Forums.

Customizations

K-Meleon has a highly flexible interface design. All the menus and toolbar buttons can be customized using its configuration files. This feature can be very useful in an environment where the general public has access to the browser such as a public library or Internet cafe.
The use of Windows native interface means that K-Meleon does not support Mozilla-based themes. Compatibility with Mozilla extensions is also limited, with only a few extensions that can be integrated. However, K-Meleon has its own pluginsWhat do each of the default K-Meleon plugins do?

K-MeleonCCF

K-MeleonCCF was developed by Hao Jiang, adding further features to K-meleon. The biggest change was the use of a true tab structure,Tabbed K-Meleon by Dorian Boissonnade as opposed to a layer system used by K-Meleon at the time. Other changes include a Lua-based macro system to replace the original macros (giving greater responsiveness), and further user interface (UI) tweaks, such as a mouse-gestures plugin.
Many of the changes implemented were included in later versions of K-Meleon, and with the release of K-Meleon 1.5, this will include "real tab support and much powerful macro plugin". Development of CCF has ceased with users being advised to move to K-Meleon 1.5 upon its release.

K-MeleonCCF ME

K-MeleonCCF ME was developed as a more streamlined version of K-MeleonCCF, using less resources and yielding more responsiveness. This is done by omitting Mozilla's XML User Interface Language (XUL) in menus, and using Lua-based macros.
It is the least resource intensive browser for Windows using an up-to-date rendering engine
Further, new features and improvements are included in each version.blogspot.com
On January 25, 2008, Hao declared his decision to discontinue the unofficial K-MeleonCCF project, however, since then he (along with increased input from Dorian) has completed version 0.08 of CCF ME, and development continues on version 0.09 of CCF ME, based on the Gecko 1.9 rendering engine. A beta version of 0.09 was tested to be twice as fast as Opera 9.5 at rendering JavaScript.

K-Meleon db types

K-Meleon db types was made as a response to the attack on the
Internet from hackers here, other countries & from corporations
& laws wanting to be passed because of them & others.
Because K-Meleon is dependent on Firefox 3.6+ Gecko & Firefox
has ended the 3.6 types.
K-Meleon db is not meant to be compliant,
but secure.
The many versions has macros that give the ability to 
turn off your DNS, XUL cache, OGG flash video, Same origin video
& more.
It also has many security settings, set in an adaptive way when
needed. Low, Med, Med-high, High. Low less, high more security.
The macros that run the settings & much of the browser also 
comes in a kit "KMFILES", 
So really you can put the function to most of the
K-Meleon types out there.
There are 2 types of "K-Meleon db"
"K-Meleon-1.6db+NS" and "K-Meleon-1.7db+" The 1.6 version
runs on the old K-Meleon 1.6 engine & has a working "NoScript" 
version 2.5 on it.
The K-Meleon-1.7db+ runs on the final Gecko rv:1.9.2.29pre
from Firefox 3.6.29pre
The more secure version is the "K-Meleon-1.6db+NS" due to
the "NoScript."
More information about the settings is at the help page I have.

Portable versions

Some users have created modifications to enhance the portability of K-Meleon so they can run the browser on other Windows computers without having to install the software. Douglas McFadzean has collected and expanded on those efforts resulting in a group of portable K-Meleon projects that are designed to "enhance" the K-Meleon browser's modularity and portability. These projects include Pocket K-Meleon, KMprof, KMV (K-Meleon on the MoVe), KMVX (K-Meleon on the MoVe eXtended, KM@, KM@X, and KMigrate. These projects focus on the ability to run K-Meleon from a USB flash drive or portable hard drive, leaving no trace of browsing on the host computer.
Douglas's work on portable K-Meleon for Windows has reduced as he has moved to using mainly Arch Linux and MEPIS Linux systems.
There have also been some early attempts at making a version of K-Meleon which can run from a read-only device, such as a CD-ROM.K-Meleon1.0.1-mod-forCD by Fred, based on Mozilla 1.8.0.6 Gecko, dated 20060730

K-Ninja, KMLite

K-Ninja, and later KMLite, were minor modifications of K-Meleon. They were designed with less on-screen space for menus and buttons, and more for web pages. An attempt was also made to expand and reorganize the right-click context menus to make them faster and easier to use.
K-Ninja was originally developed by Mark Reaves at Mot Studios. When Mark left Mot Studios and founded LDIOS (the Linux Desktop Initiation Operating System), the Official K-Ninja Forum also moved to the LDIOS site, which has not functioned since November 29, 2005. Mark was then no longer available to maintain the project.
On June 29, 2005, "TransitMan" updated the K-Ninja rendering engine to Gecko 1.7.9 beta, and since March 12, 2006, "Al." updated it further and began to maintain it on a new homepage as K-Ninja Samurai v1.x, with the v1.7.13 Gecko engine.
Al. continued development of K-Ninja and introduced K-Ninja v2.0 which updated the codebase to the same as K-Meleon v1.0, which was based upon Gecko v1.8. K-Ninja v2.0 saw several releases each concentrating on bugfixes and stability, plus security updates to the Gecko rendering engine.
The last couple of K-Ninja releases were done privately as a service to existing K-Ninja users reluctant to switch to another browser. The last release was K-Ninja v2.2.1 (codenamed Cydonia based on Gecko v1.8.1.12). An experimental version using the older Gecko v1.8.0.14pre rendering engine was also developed during this time; it was named "Orbital".
On March 12, 2008, K-Ninja development was wrapped up by Al.K-Ninja Archives Google Group, K-Ninja website
KMLite was an attempt at rebranding to lessen confusion for those people who didn't realise that K-Ninja was based on K-Meleon. KMLite was an abbreviation on the name K-Meleon Lite. The Lite part of the name obviously referring to the lite interface and features that KMLite shared with K-Ninja. KMLite was based upon the K-Meleon v1.5 codebase, which also featured the Gecko v1.8.x rendering engine. KMLite also shared the plugin macro system and XUL based Preferences Panel that was also part of K-Meleon v1.5.
The last version of KMLite released was v1.1.2 which featured Gecko v1.8.1.19. Al. announced on 21 April 2009 that he was no longer available to continue further development of K-Ninja or KMLite.

NX Variations

Developed and maintained by Fred, NX editions are unofficial versions that are optimised for Linux distros through the Wine emulator. Those versions can also run on MS Windows for those who prefer extreme light versions. Recent editions use K-Meleon's 1.5.x binaries and are based on the latest Gecko trunks-mainly 1.9.x. builds. Fred's NX editions provide a "sneak preview" for the upcoming K-Meleon 1.6  with 1.9.x Gecko and are therefore excellent testbeds for the official K-Meleon trunk migration. The NX editions are characterised by their special bookmarks for various news and online radio station websites.
