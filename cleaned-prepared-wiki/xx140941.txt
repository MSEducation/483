SMS ''Arcona was the ninth member of the ten-ship .
Arcona served in all three German navies in the first half of the 20th century. She served both with the fleet and abroad during her career in the Imperial Navy in the early 1900s. In World War I, she was used as a coastal defense ship and then as a support vessel for the U-boat campaign in the Atlantic. After the war, she served briefly in the Reichsmarine before being withdrawn and used for secondary duties. The Kriegsmarine rebuilt Arcona as a floating anti-aircraft battery and used her to defend several German ports during World War II. She was scuttled in the final days of the war, and broken up for scrap in 1948–1949.

Construction

Arcona was ordered under the contract name "H" and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in 1901 and launched on 22 April 1902, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 12 May 1903. 99–102 The ship was . She had a crew of 14 officers and 256 enlisted men. 99–101
The ship was armed with ten 10.5 cm SK L/40 guns in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to  thick shields. 99

Service history

After her commissioning, Arcona was assigned to the fleet reconnaissance forces. 102 In 1905, she was assigned to the Cruiser Division, alongside her sister . 22 Arcona was assigned to overseas duty in 1907, which lasted for three years. In 1909, Arcona cruised the Pacific coast on the United States, including a stop in Honolulu. 174 While there, on 10 December, she assisted the British merchant ship Celtic Chief, which had run aground on a reef outside Honolulu. After the ship had been lightened by removing its cargo, Arcona pulled the merchantman free from the reef. 193
Arcona returned to Germany in 1910 and resumed service with the fleet. She was modernized in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven in 1911–1912. Two of the ship's 10.5 cm guns were removed, and two  deck-mounted torpedo tubes were installed, along with provisions to carry 200 naval mines. After returning to duty in 1913, the ship was withdrawn from front-line service for use as a mine warfare test ship. The two guns removed in 1912 were reinstalled in 1914. 100–101 After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Arcona was employed as a coastal defense vessel. Later in the war, Arcona was transferred to the Ems estuary, where she coordinated radio communications with the U-boats attacking British merchant shipping. 29
After the end of the war, Germany was charged with sweeping all naval mines in the North Sea by the Treaty of Versailles. She was thereafter commissioned into the newly reorganized Reichsmarine in 1921 and served until 1923, when she was withdrawn from service. She was stricken on 15 January 1930 and used as a barracks ship initially in Wilhelmshaven, after 1936, in Swinemünde by the newly renamed Kriegsmarine, and in Kiel after 1938, where she remained until the outbreak of World War II in September 1939.
In May 1940, Arcona was converted into a floating anti-aircraft battery in Swinemünde, where she was stationed initially. Her armament now consisted of one 10.5 cm SK C/32 gun, four 10.5 cm SK C/33 guns, two 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns, and four 2 cm guns. 222 She was later moved to Wilhelmshaven, where she was assigned to Naval Anti-Aircraft Group 233, and she was transferred to Brunsbüttel later in the war. In closing days of the war in Europe, her crew scuttled the ship to prevent her from being captured, on 3 May 1945. Nevertheless, the Royal Navy took control of the naval installation at Brunsbüttel on 7 May, after the German surrender. Arcona was among the warships that were seized, including four U-boats and the badly damaged destroyer Z31. Their German crews unloaded ammunition and removed weapons from the ships under British supervision. 59 She was subsequently broken up for scrap in 1948–1949.
