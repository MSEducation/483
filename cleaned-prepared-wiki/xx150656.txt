Biography

Judy Fiskin grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from Pomona College, where her classmates included future artists Chris Burden and James Turrell.wikipedia."Womanspace Gallery records, 1972-1974," Archives of American Art,   In addition to her photography and video, she's also an award-winning writer for her essay "Borges, Stryker, Evans: The Sorrows of Representation," published originally in the photography journal Views in 1988, reprinted in Multiple Views: Logan Grant Essays on Photography, published by University of New Mexico Press in 1991.

Photography

Since her first show at Castelli Graphics in New York City in 1976, Fiskin's photographs have had the same distinctive format: small black-and-white images, two and one-half inches square, printed on letter-sized white paper. She began with vernacular architecture in Los Angeles and gained critical attention for her "Dingbat" series, anonymous small 1950s apartment buildings (of the dingbat type) in Los Angeles shot from across the street in a deadpan style. Other series focused on desert scenes, military buildings, and period furniture.  In 1992, MOCA in Los Angeles held a mid-career retrospective for Fiskin; critics praised the intelligence, wit, and stylistic coherence of her work. Her photographs have been exhibited widely, including the Pompidou Center in Paris displaying 24 prints as part of their historic 2006 exhibit, "Los Angeles 1955-1985, Birth of an Art Capital," and MOCA Los Angeles displayed 15 prints in their 2009-2010 show "Collection: MOCA's First 30 Years."  Her photos are being shown at five Pacific Standard Time exhibitions in 2011 and 2012: "Under the Big Black Sun: California Art 1974-81," at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; "Seismic Shift: California Landscape Photography, 1944-1984" at the California Museum of Photography at UC Riverside,

Video

Fiskin began making video in 1998 with "Diary of a Midlife Crisis," a serio-comic video diary about a middle-aged photographer whose fear of moving the video camera provided a metaphor for her feeling of being creatively at a standstill. The video won awards at the San Francisco International Film Festival and at Worldfest Houston, and was screened at MOCA in Los Angeles, and in Bonn, Kassel, and Brisbane, among other places.  Critical acclaim for that work led the J. Paul Getty Museum to commission the video installation "My Getty Center" in 2000,J. Paul Getty Museum. Departures: 11 artists at the Getty. Judy Fiskin. My Getty Center. Retrieved August 29, 2008. another comic personal video diary that chronicled the opening of the new Getty Center in Los Angeles.  LACMA commissioned "What We Think About When We Think About Ships," a video installation at LACMALab based on a painting in its collection.  Her 2003 video "50 Ways to Set the Table" documented the competition in table setting at the Los Angeles County Fair—a metaphor for the creative process and the work of the critic. 265  That video has been screened in the Documentary Fortnight series at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, at the Berkeley Film and Video Festival and at Angles Gallery, Santa Monica.  Her 2007 video, "The End of Photography," a three-minute elegy for the darkroom, was exhibited in Paris, Berlin, Kassel, and in Los Angeles at the Getty, LACMA, MOCA, and at Angles Gallery.  "Like all great works of art," David Pagel wrote in a review in the Los Angeles Times, the video "tells more than one story."David Pagel, "Farewell to an Art, Farewell to an Era," Los Angeles Times, April 13, 2007, E20   "By turns poetic and funny," Fiskin said, "the film is about the talk around art and the mute beauty of photography, the disconcerting ties between kitsch and art, and the ultimate inadequacy of all kinds of description."  Christopher Knight, art critic for the L.A. Times, called the video "inspired. . . a surprising journey into your own conflicted assumptions about substance and significance."Christopher Knight, "Judy Fiskin at Angles Gallery," Los Angeles Times, March 12, 2010  Fiskin: All Six Films," Angles Gallery, Los Angeles,  235;
