Blumenthal Performing Arts (also NC Blumenthal Center and NCBPAC) is located in Charlotte, North Carolina. It opened in 1992 and is named in honor of the people of the state of North Carolina and the Blumenthal Foundation established by I.D. Blumenthal who founded RSC Brands, the largest private donor to the capital campaign. The idea for the center dates back to the late 1970s. Momentum for the project grew in the 1980s resulting in a $15 million allocation from the state of North Carolina, approval of a $15 million bond by the citizens of Charlotte and an additional $32 million contributed by individuals, corporations and foundations. In 1987 the Belk Brothers donated a valuable piece of land as the site of the new theatre complex. Total construction cost for the Blumenthal Center was over $62 million.

Architecture

The Blumenthal Center and the adjacent Founder's Hall and Bank of America corporate center were all designed by CÃ©sar Pelli
and Associates. Acoustical design was completed by acoustical consultant Kirkegaard Associates. Project management was provided by Theatrical Project Consultants (TPC). General contractor on the project was Becon Construction of Charlotte, NC.
