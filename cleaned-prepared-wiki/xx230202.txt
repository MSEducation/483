Die Spinne, translated as The Spider, is believed by some to be a secret organization established and led in part by Otto Skorzeny, Hitler's commando chief, as well as Nazi intelligence officer Reinhard Gehlen which helped as many as 600 former SS men escape from Germany to Spain, Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, Bolivia and other countries. 
Die Spinne was established by Skorzeny using the cover names of Robert Steinbacher and Otto Steinbauer, and supported by either Nazi funds or, according to some sources, Austrian Intelligence. Later, Skorzeny, Gehlen and their network of collaborators had gained significant influence in parts of Europe and Latin America. Skorzeny travelled between Francoist Spain and Argentina, where he acted as an advisor to President Juan Perón and bodyguard of Eva Perón,"Peculiar liaisons: in war, espionage, and terrorism in the twentieth century", John S.

According to Infield, the idea for the Die Spinne network began in 1944 as Hitler's chief intelligence officer Reinhard Gehlen foresaw a possible downfall of the Third Reich Infield, p. 201 due to Nazi military failures in Russia. T.H. Tetens, expert on German geopolitics and member of the US War Crimes Commission in 1946-1947, referred to a group overlapping with die Spinne as the Führungsring "a kind of political Mafia, with headquarters in Madrid... serving various purposes." T.H. Tetens. The New Germany and the Old Nazis. Random House/Marzani+Munsel, 1961. p. 31 The Madrid office built up what was referred to as a sort of Fascist International, per Tetens. Tetens, p. 73 According to Tetens the German leadership also included Dr. Hans Globke, who had written the official commentary on the Nuremberg Laws. Tetens, p. 38 Globke held the important position of Director of the German Chancellery from 1953 until 1963, serving as adviser for Konrad Adenauer, Tetens, pp. 39–41
