Personal Records

Professional career

2010 NFL Combine

2010 NFL Draft

Leading up to the 2010 NFL Scouting Combine, Trindon Holliday had hoped to set the record for the 40 yard dash,

Houston Texans

Holliday was drafted in the 6th round of the 2010 draft. Despite his speed, Holliday struggled on kickoff returns in the preseason. He was placed on IR because of a fracture in his thumb. September 3, 2011 he was cut then placed on the practice squad. On October 5, his practice squad contract was terminated. He was later added to the active roster, but was waived on October 25. In the 2012 preseason week 1 match up versus the Carolina Panthers, he returned a kickoff return for a touchdown. The next week versus the San Francisco 49ers, he returned a punt for a touchdown. In the final preseason game versus the Minnesota Vikings, Holliday recorded his third touchdown in four games; this touchdown was a 76-yard punt return. Following the 2012 preseason, Holliday made the Houston Texans 53-man roster and was the starting punt and kick returner. Holliday was waived from the Texans on October 10, 2012 in a move to bolster an injury-depleted defense. Part of the reason Holliday was released was due to his fumbling problems. Trindon fumbled the ball 6 times in 2012, losing only one of them.go.com/nfl/player/gamelog/_/id/13386/year/2012/trindon-holliday

Denver Broncos

On October 11, 2012, Holliday was claimed off of waivers by the Denver Broncos. He returned a kickoff 105 yards for a touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals on November 4, 2012, breaking the Broncos record for the longest play. On November 11, 2012, he returned a Carolina Panthers punt for 76 yards. The play was ruled a touchdown despite his fumbling of the ball on the 1 yard line.  He started the season with the Texans who were 5-0 when they cut him.  He was then acquired by the Broncos who finished the regular season 13-3 with an 11 game win streak.
On January 12, 2013, Holliday returned a punt in the first quarter of the game versus the Baltimore Ravens for a 90 yard touchdown, the longest punt return in postseason history.
In the 2013 Season, Holliday returned a punt 81 yards for a touchdown in week 2 against the New York Giants. He also returned a kick-off 105 yards for a touchdown in week 4 against the Philadelphia Eagles.

New York Giants

On March 17, 2014, Holliday signed a one-year deal with the New York Giants.

Issues with size

At 65 inches (165 cm), Holliday is the shortest player in the NFL, and Holliday had a difficult time getting started in football. His mother held him out of football until 7th grade, because she was afraid he would be injured. After several years of performing at a high level, his high school coaches finally let him start as a running back during his junior year. In his senior year he accumulated over 2,000 yards and over 30 touchdowns, leading Northeast High to back-to-back State Semi-Final appearances.
Fearing that college recruiters would not believe Holliday's actual running times, his high school coaches added to his recorded times before sending them in. Despite his speed records, several schools, including Duke and Louisiana-Lafayette, rejected Holliday due to his small size.
Holliday was never scheduled to appear at LSU's camp. LSU was interested in another Northeast player, (WR Aaron Brown) but that player didn't want to go to the camp alone. So David Masterson, Holliday's high school coach, took Holliday along also. After initial workouts, Holliday ran the 40 in 4.28 seconds wearing high top basketball shoes. The time was so outrageous that the LSU coaches began arguing if they had started their stopwatches on time. "They asked me if Trindon could run it again," Masterson said. "He didn't even get in a track stance. He ran the second 40 in 4.27. He's one of those little freaks of nature." Despite this, LSU coach Les Miles still considered canceling Holliday's scholarship offer until holdover offensive coordinator Jimbo Fisher convinced Miles that Holliday could play at a college level.
