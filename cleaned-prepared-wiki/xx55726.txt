Charles Williams Nash (January 28, 1864 — June 6, 1948) was a United States automobile entrepreneur and served as an executive in the automotive industry.

Early life

Nash was born to a farming family in Cortland, Illinois, on what is now Route 38 — Lincoln Highway. His mother was Anna E. "Annie" Cadwell (1829–1909) who married David L. Nash. Other Nash siblings included Mazovia (b. 1862), George C. (b. 1866) and Laura W. (b. 1868). After Charles' parent's separation, at age 6, Charles worked as a farm-hand in Michigan as an indentured servant. He later became a shepherd to the owner of hay-bailing machinery. 
On April 23, 1884, he married Jessie Halleck whom he had met while pressing hay on her father's farm. They then moved to Flint, Michigan, in 1890 where he was noticed by William C. Durant of the Durant-Dort Carriage Company. Durant hired him in 1890, and Nash became a supervisor.
In 1897, Nash had a chance to drive an early electric automobile in New York City, and became very interested in the commercial potential of this newly developed contraption.

Automobile industry

Nash co-founded Buick Motor Company with David D. Buick and William C. Durant, and in 1908 became Buick's president and general manager.
In 1910, he was hired as general manager of the General Motors Corporation (GMC). He took over a debt-ridden company suffering losses and increased profits to US$800,000 as early as 1911 to over $12 million by 1914, as well as secured the firms financial footing. However, his reluctance to pay dividends to shareholders resulted in Nash being voted out of his position in 1915.
Nash, who took control of GM in 1910 from William Durant, was now fired by him when Durant regained control in 1916.
Nash then resolved never again to work for someone else. He bought out the Jeffery Motor Company in August 1916. In 1917, renamed it as Nash Motors. The 1917 Nash Model 671 was the first vehicle produced to bear the name of the new company's founder. The new company was successful, with sales totaling 31,008 trucks and cars by 1919.
In addition to running Nash Motors, Charles Nash was also president of the luxury car company LaFayette Motors until that company was bought out by Nash Motors in 1924.

Retirement

Charles W. Nash retired in 1936. His successor at the company was George W. Mason, who was recommended by Walter Chrysler.
He lived in retirement for twelve years later and died at the age of 84 in Beverly Hills, California. His health failed at the death of his wife in 1947. He died in 1948, and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale next to his wife.
