Thomas Francis Bayard (October 29, 1828 – September 28, 1898) was an American lawyer, politician, and diplomat from Wilmington, Delaware. A Democrat, he served three terms as United States Senator from Delaware and made three unsuccessful bids for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States.  In 1885, President Grover Cleveland appointed him Secretary of State.  After four years in private life, he returned to the diplomatic arena as Ambassador to the United Kingdom.
Born in Delaware to a prominent family, Bayard learned politics from his father, James A. Bayard, Jr., who also served in the Senate.  In 1869, the Delaware legislature elected Bayard to the Senate upon his father's retirement.  A Peace Democrat during the Civil War, Bayard spent his early years in the Senate in opposition to Republican policies, especially the Reconstruction of the defeated Confederacy.  His conservatism extended to financial matters, as he became known as a staunch supporter of the gold standard and an opponent of greenbacks and silver coinage, which he believed would cause inflation.  Bayard's conservative politics made him popular in the South and with Eastern financial interests, but never popular enough to obtain the Democratic nomination for President, which he attempted to win in 1876, 1880, and 1884.
In 1885, President Cleveland appointed Bayard Secretary of State.  Bayard worked with Cleveland to promote American trade in the Pacific while avoiding the acquisition of colonies at a time when many Americans clamored for them.  He sought increased cooperation with Great Britain, working to resolve disputes over fishing and seal-hunting rights in the American-Canadian border waters.  As ambassador, Bayard continued to strive for Anglo-American friendship.  This brought him into conflict with his successor at the State Department, Richard Olney when Olney and Cleveland demanded more aggressive diplomatic overtures than Bayard wished in the Venezuela Crisis of 1895.  His term at the American embassy ended in 1897, and he died the following year.

Early life and family

Thomas F. Bayard was born in Wilmington, Delaware in 1828, the second son of James A. Bayard, Jr. and Anne née Francis.
Thomas Bayard was educated in private academies in Wilmington and, after his father moved to New York City for business reasons, in Flushing, New York.
Bayard was admitted to the bar in 1851, the year his father was elected to the United States Senate.

Civil War and Reconstruction

Thomas Bayard's return to Wilmington in 1858 brought greater involvement in the political scene.  James Bayard was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention, and Thomas attended with him.  The elder Bayard supported Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia for the nomination.
In 1860, Delaware occupied an unusual position in the free state-slave state divide; nominally a slave state, Delaware's slave population had been in steep decline for decades and represented just 1.6% of the state's people.
Bayard's father was reelected to the Senate in 1862, but resigned shortly thereafter in protest of the new oath of office, which demanded that Senators swear they had never borne arms against the United States nor given aid and encouragement to its enemies.
Thomas Bayard became more politically active, speaking at a public meeting in September 1867 against constitutional proposals for ending racial discrimination in voting rights.

United States Senator

Reaction to Reconstruction

James Bayard retired from the Senate when his term ended in 1869, and the legislature elected his son to the seat with little opposition.
Although his protests were to little effect, Bayard continued to voice opposition to the majority party's plans for reconstructing the South.
As more Democrats returned to the Senate, and as Republican goals shifted elsewhere, Bayard's ideas gained some traction, but were still largely in vain.  In 1873, the Senate passed a resolution he introduced that demanded that Grant disclose how much government money was being expended in enforcing Reconstruction laws in the South, and to whom it was paid; the President ignored the resolution.

Specie resumption

From the start of his congressional career, Bayard was an advocate of hard money, i.e., a dollar backed by gold.
In 1873, a business depression (known as the Panic of 1873), increased the pressure for retaining greenbacks, as some in Congress believed that inflating the currency would ease the economic problems.  Grant's Treasury Secretary, William Adams Richardson, reissued $26 million of the redeemed greenbacks, reversing the administration's previous policy of removing them from circulation.

Election of 1876

Bayard's popularity with his party had grown during his time in the Senate, and by 1875 he was seen as a contender for the presidency.
Displeased with the result, Bayard nonetheless supported the Democratic nominee against Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, the Republican candidate, speaking to large crowds in cities across the North and Midwest.
The counts of the disputed ballots were inconclusive, with each state producing two sets of returns, one signed by Democratic officials, the other by Republicans, each claiming victory for their man.  There was debate about which person or house of Congress was authorized to decide between the competing slates of electors, with the Republican Senate and the Democratic House each claiming priority.
Davis upset the careful planning by accepting election to the Senate by the state of Illinois and refusing to serve on the commission.

Gold standard

In 1873, Congress had passed a Coinage Act that regulated which coins were legal tender.  The list of legal coins duplicated that of the previous coinage act, leaving off only the silver dollar and three smaller coins.
Over the next few years, pressure to reintroduce silver coinage grew, and cut across party lines.

Clashes with Hayes

The elections of 1878 returned control of both houses of Congress to the Democrats for the first time since before the Civil War.  The new Democratic majority passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Force Acts.
Bayard also clashed with Hayes on the issue of Chinese immigration.  In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country. As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages.

Election of 1880

As the election of 1880 drew near, Bayard was again regarded as a likely candidate.
As Tilden's star began to fade, many Democrats looked to Bayard.  He remained popular in the Eastern cities for his conservatism and hard money beliefs, but many in the South, including Senator Augustus Hill Garland of Arkansas, advised Bayard to embrace silver to help halt the defections of Southern and Western Democrats to the new Greenback Party.
Leading up to the convention in Cincinnati, Tilden remained ambiguous about his intentions.

Budget surplus and civil service reform

The Delaware legislature re-elected Bayard to the Senate for a third term in 1881 without serious opposition.
Among the issues confronting the Senate was the surplus of government funds. With high revenue held over from wartime taxes, the federal government had collected more than it spent since 1866; by 1882 the surplus reached $145 million.
Bayard and Arthur also agreed on the need for civil service reform.  Garfield's assassination by a deranged office seeker amplified the public demand for civil service reform.

Election of 1884

Despite his rebukes at the Democratic national conventions in 1876 and 1880, Bayard was again considered among the leading candidates for the nomination in 1884.
By the time the Democrats had assembled in Chicago on July 8, 1884 to begin their convention, the Republicans had already picked their nominee: James G. Blaine of Maine.  Blaine's nomination turned many reform-minded Republicans (known as Mugwumps) away from their party.  Bayard and Cleveland, seen as honest politicians, were the Democrats most favored by the renegade Republican faction.
The resulting campaign between Cleveland and Blaine focused more on scandal and mudslinging than the issues of the day.

Secretary of State

Samoa and Hawaii

Among the first foreign policy challenges Bayard and Cleveland faced was that concerning American influence in the Samoan Islands.  
Shortly thereafter, Tamasese's unpopularity led another claimant, Mata'afa Iosefo, to start a rebellion that led to the Samoan Civil War.
In the Kingdom of Hawaii, Bayard and Cleveland pursued a similar goal of maintaining the Hawaiian kingdom's independence while expanding access for American trade.

Relations with Britain

Despite their agreement on Samoa, much of Bayard's term of office was taken up in settling disputes with Great Britain.  The largest of these concerned the Canadian fisheries off the Atlantic coasts of Canada and Newfoundland.
Britain agreed to negotiate, and a six-member commission convened in Washington in June 1887.
A similar dispute with Britain arose in the Pacific, over the rights of Canadians to hunt seals in waters off the Pribilof Islands, a part of Alaska.

Return to private life

Bayard's term as Secretary of State ended in March 1889 after Cleveland's defeat, and he returned to Wilmington to resume his law practice.  He lived in "very comfortable circumstances" there, with a fortune estimated at $300,000, although his income from the law practice was modest.

Ambassador to Great Britain

On June 12, 1893, Lord Rosebury, the British Foreign Minister, received Bayard in London.
Bayard spent the summer of 1894 in the United States conferring with Gresham. The tension in the Venezuelan boundary dispute continued to escalate, while British disagreements with Nicaragua also threatened to involve the United States.
The tension over Nicaragua soon abated, but the May 1895 death of Secretary Gresham, who like Bayard had favored cooperation with the British, led to increased disagreement over the Venezuela issue.
Olney's note was met with vehement disagreement and delay, but when tempers cooled, the British agreed to arbitration later that year.

Death and legacy

Bayard remained in London until the arrival of his successor, John Hay, in April 1897.
Thirteen years after his death, the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica said of Bayard that "his tall dignified person, unfailing courtesy, and polished, if somewhat deliberate, eloquence made him a man of mark in all the best circles. He was considered indeed by many Americans to have become too partial to English ways; and, for the expression of some criticisms regarded as unfavorable to his own countrymen, the House of Representatives went so far as to pass ... a vote of censure on him.  The value of Bayard's diplomacy was, however, fully recognized in the United Kingdom where he worthily upheld the traditions of a famous line of American ministers."
