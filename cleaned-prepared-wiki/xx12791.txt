The 99 names of God in Islam (or the 99 names of Allah; 

Origin

According to Islamic tradition,Ibn Majah, Book of Du`a; Imam Malik, Muwatta', Kitab al-Shi`r. Muhammad is said to have invoked Allah by a number of names. The most common hadith used to cite the 99 names is considered weak, though there are less commonly cited hadith which are considered authentic and also support the same point. 10. Santa Barbara, California Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2010. ISBN 9780313360251 A widely accepted hadith in Sahih Muslim states:

Over time, it became custom to recite a list of 99 names, compiled by al-Walid ibn Muslim, as an addendum to the hadith. In 2005, Mahmoud Abdel-Razek compiled an alternative list, endorsing only 69 from the al-Walid list. His objections are mostly grammatical in that a 'name' in Arabic must be a noun: "only 69 of those Names are authenticated from the Quran and Sunnah, while 29 are not authentic in that 22 are verbs or adjectives, and 7 are 'modafa' or 'added to.'" Islamic Forum
The Qur'an refers to the names of God as God's "most beautiful Names" (). According to Gerhard Böwering:
 Mystic philosopher Ibn Arabi surmized that the 99 names are outward signs of the universe's inner mysteries. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, 2011. ISBN 9781118053966
Most, though not all, of the 99 names appear in the Qur'an with a smaller number appearing exclusively in the hadith. 206. William Carey Library, 2005.

Lists of names

There isn't universal agreement among Muslims as to what exactly counts as a name and what does not. Additionally, while some names are only in the Qur'an, and others are only in the hadith, there are some names which appear in both. Different sources give different lists of the 99 names.

The Greatest Name

The 99 names point to the inherent unity of the all-embracing Greatest Name (Ismi Azam). The endnote states: "Ibn Májah, Sunan, 34. (Kitáb ad-Du'á), ch. 9, no. 3856, vol. 2, p. 1267. See also: Ad-Dárimí, Sunan, 23 (Fada'il al-Qur'án), ch. 15, no. 3296, vol. 2, pp. 324-5. Similar statements in Shi'i Traditions include: Majlisí, Bihár al-Anwár, vol. 26. p. 7."

Personal names

According to Islamic tradition,Islam-QA website Are there any names which it is forbidden to use? If so, what are they? a Muslim may not be given any of the 99 names of Allah in exactly the same form.  For example, nobody may be named al-Malik (The King), but may be named Malik (King). This is because of the belief that Allah is almighty, and no human being is the equivalent of Allah, and no human being will ever be the equivalent of Allah. Muslims are allowed to use the 99 names of Allah for themselves but should not put 'Al' at the front of them.
However the names of Allah can be combined with the word "'Abd-" which means "servant/Worshiper" (of Allah) and are commonly used as personal names among Muslims. For example 'Abd ar-Raḥmān ("Servant of the Most Compassionate/the Beneficent"). The two parts of the name may be written separately (as above) or combined as one transliterated name; in such a case, the vowel transcribed after 'Abd is often written as u when the two words are transcribed as one: e.g., Abdurrahman, Abdul'aziz, "Abdul Jabbar", or even Abdullah ("Servant of Allah"). (This has to do with Arabic case vowels, the final u vowel showing the normal "quote" nominative/vocative case form: 'abd-u.)
Some Muslim people have names resembling those 99. Examples include:

Views of other religions

Bábí and Bahá'í view

Bahá'í sources state that the 100th name was revealed as "Bahá'" (an Arabic word بهاء meaning "glory, splendor" etc.), which is the root word for Bahá'u'lláh and Bahá'í. They also believe that it is the 'Greatest Name'. The Báb wrote a noted pentagram-shaped tablet with 360 derivatives of the word "Bahá'" used in it.
According to Bahá'í scholar 'Abdu'l-Hamíd Ishráq-Khávari, Baha' ad-Din al-`Amili adopted the pen name (takhallus) 'Baha' after being inspired by words of Shi'a Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (the fifth Imam) and Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (the sixth Imam), who had stated that the Greatest Name of God was included in either Du'ay-i-Sahar or A`amaal Ummi Dawud.

Zoroastrianism

Some names of Allah are similar to 101 names of Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism.avesta.htm
