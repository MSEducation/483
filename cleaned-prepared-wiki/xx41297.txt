MacPaint is a discontinued bitmap-based graphics painting software program developed by Apple Computer and released with the original Macintosh personal computer on January 24, 1984. It was sold separately for US$195 with its word processor counterpart, MacWrite.
Pictures could also be cut from MacPaint and pasted into the resource fork of any application via ResEdit, allowing application internationalization.
The original MacPaint was developed by Bill Atkinson, a member of Apple's original Macintosh development team.

Development

MacPaint was written by Bill Atkinson, a member of Apple's original Macintosh development team. The original MacPaint consisted of 5,804 lines of Pascal computer code, augmented by another 2,738 lines of 68000 assembly language. 174 MacPaint's user interface was designed by Susan Kare, also a member of the Macintosh team. Kare also beta tested MacPaint before release.
MacPaint uses two offscreen memory buffers to avoid flicker when dragging shapes or images across the screen. 171 One of these buffers contained the existing pixels of a document, and the other contained the pixels of its previous state. The second buffer was used as the basis of the software's undo feature. In April 1983, the software's name was changed from MacSketch to MacPaint. 172 The original MacPaint was programmed as a single-document interface. The palette positions and sizes were unalterable, as was the document window. This was different from other Macintosh software at the time, which allowed the users to move windows and resize them.
The original MacPaint did not incorporate a zoom function. Instead of a zoom function, a special magnification mode called FatBits was used. FatBits showed each pixel as a clickable rectangle with a white border. The FatBits editing mode set the standard for many future editors. 147 MacPaint included a "Goodies" menu which included the FatBits tool. This menu was named the "Aids" menu in prerelease versions, but was renamed "Goodies" as public awareness of the AIDS epidemic grew in the summer of 1983. 155-156

Release and version history

MacPaint was first advertised in an 18-page brochure in December 1983, following the earlier announcement of the Macintosh 128k. After launch, a New York Times reviewer noted how MacPaint unfolded numerous graphic possibilities for the personal computer; he went further to say  "it is better than anything else of its kind offered on personal computers by a factor of 10."
MacPaint 2.0 was released on January 11, 1988 by Claris. Claris stopped selling MacPaint in early 1998 because of diminishing sales. There has been an unofficial update called MacPaint X which is 3.0 beta, mainly for people who wished to be able to use the program. Though it is unstable, it brings back memories for many.
MacPaint 1.3's source code (written in a combination of Assembly and Pascal) is available through the Computer History Museum, along with the QuickDraw source code, a library to draw bitmapped graphics.
MacPaint inspired other companies to release similar products for other platforms. Mouse Systems' PC Paint was released for the IBM PC, and cost US$100. IBM released their painting package, Color Paint, for the IBM PCjr for US$100.
