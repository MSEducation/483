The Chevrolet Lumina is a name used on many vehicles produced under the Chevrolet marque. First introduced for the 1989 model year; Chevrolet used the name on a sedan, a coupé and a minivan. The sedan replaced the Chevrolet Celebrity, the coupé replaced the Monte Carlo, and the minivan was a completely new vehicle. The Lumina coupé was replaced by the 1995 Monte Carlo, the Lumina minivan was replaced by the 1997 Chevrolet Venture, and the Lumina sedan was replaced by the 2000 Impala in the U.S. and Canada; in Mexico, it was replaced with the Chevrolet Caprice.

First generation (1989–1995)

The North American Chevrolet Lumina was based on the mid-size GM W platform, which was shared with the Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme (later Intrigue), Buick Regal and Buick Century (after 1996). Although the Lumina became a popular seller, GM was widely criticized in the motoring press for being late to the game in introducing a direct aero-designed competitor to the Ford Taurus.  The Chevrolet Lumina's first generation ended production in 1995, making this the shortest-lived generation of the first-generation GM W-body cars.
In 1989, the Lumina became the nameplate under which Chevrolets were raced in NASCAR, more than a year before the model was available to the public.

Lumina Z34

Starting in 1990, Chevrolet offered a high performance version of the Lumina, the Lumina Z34. In order to enhance its performance it came standard with the FE3 sport suspension package, the 210 hp LQ1 V6 engine shared with the Lumina Euro 3.4 (sedan), the five speed Getrag 284 manual transmission, dual exhaust and four-wheel anti-lock brakes. The Z34 also featured cosmetic changes to go along with the performance enhancements such as unique front and rear fascias, side skirts, a rear spoiler, a louvered hood, a unique steering wheel and sport bucket seats. Performance figures were quite impressive for a front wheel drive V6 engine powered car, with a 0-60 mph (0–97 km/h) time of 7.5 seconds, a 1/4 mile (~400 m) time of 15.5 seconds, a (limited) top speed of 130 mph (209.21 km/h), a 60-0 mph (97–0 km/h) distance of in 153 ft (47 m), and a lateral acceleration of 0.79 g's (7.7 m/s²). A Bose stereo system and automatic transmission, which lowered the horsepower rating to 200 and 0-60 time by a .5 seconds, were optional. The only paint colors available for the Z34 were white, red, black, gray, silver, and light blue. 
In 1995, the Lumina Z34 was replaced with the Chevrolet Monte Carlo Z34.

Second generation (1995–2001)

The Lumina received new sheetmetal increasing its size and an updated interior for 1995.  Unlike its other W platform counterparts, the Lumina retained the first-generation chassis.  Replacing the Lumina two-door was a resurrected Monte Carlo.  The LH0 V6 was dropped in favor of the L82 V6, known as the 3100 SFI; the  latter engine produced 20 more horsepower from the same displacement thanks to a revised intake manifold and cylinder heads.  
Initial trim levels consisted of base and LS; the latter replacing Euro trim. Options included an electric sunroof, leather bucket seats, power windows, power driver seat, and AM/FM stereo with CD player.  This Lumina was also sold with police (code 9C3) and taxi packages, due to the Chevrolet Caprice being discontinued after the 1996 model year. (1998 in Mexico)
The LTZ trim was introduced in 1997 to soften the blow from the discontinued Impala SS and Caprice.  Its standard features included 16" brushed aluminum wheels, blackwall radial sport tires, sport tuned suspension, a 3.1 L V6 rated at  of torque, a rear spoiler, restyled front and rear body clips (resembling the Monte Carlo Z34), a tachometer, and a floor-mounted shifter.
In 1998 the 3.4 L V6 was replaced by the 3800 Series II which made  and the rev limiter kicks in at 5800 rpm.
Also in 1998, the Lumina received second generation airbags.  The front-wheel drive Chevrolet Impala was introduced as a replacement for the Lumina in 2000, although GM did produce 2001 model year Luminas to be exclusively sold for rental fleets.  Retail sales of the Lumina ended in Canada in 1999, with the United States following suit a year later.  Fleet production ended on April 26, 2001. In some Asian countries, the Lumina continued as a rebadged Buick Century/Regal.

Throughout its lifecycle, the second generation Lumina was available in three trim levels:
Base (1995–2001): The most popular Lumina, the base model came well equipped for its price point. It had standard six-passenger seating, power locks, tilt steering wheel, dual airbags, and air conditioning. Base models were equipped with fifteen-inch steel wheels with wheel covers.
LS (1995–1999): One step above the base, LS models offered aluminum wheels, optional dual zone temperature controls, power windows (optional on Base), tachometer, higher-end stereo with GM's Delcolock, anti-lock brakes, remote keyless entry system, upgraded seats, and an optional 3.4 L DOHC engine (1995-1997) or 3.8 L 3800 V6 (1998-1999).
LTZ (1997–1999): The top of the line Lumina which included alloy wheels, a choice of the 3.1 L V6 engine, 3.4L DOHC engine or 3.8 L V6 engine (1998-1999 only), power driver seat, dual zone climate control and leather with the option for deluxe cloth.
