Biography

Lanie (pronounced "Lannie") Lane was born on 11 February 1987 as Lanier Stefanie Myra Johnston and grew up in Sydney. From 12-years-old, Lane was taught guitar by her father and older brother.

Music

On 24 September 2010 she issued her debut single, "What Do I Do", which is the theme tune for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation TV series, Crownies (from July to December 2011).abc.au/tv/crownies/ Lane was working as a florist to raise finances for her debut album, To the Horses. She recorded most of the album in February 2011. In August she added the lately written track, "(Oh Well) That's What You Get (Falling in Love with a Cowboy)". According to Lane the track is a result of somniloquy, "I woke up one morning and my boyfriend said, 'You said the weirdest thing in your sleep last night'. He told me and said you'd better write a song about it. I wrote the song and he said, 'Well, that's one side of the story'".
Lane has a quirky 1950s dress sense and her music draws inspiration from 1930s to 1950s Americana. Her backing band includes Zoe Hauptman on bass guitar and double bass, Paul Derricott (ex-The Rhino Factory) on drums, Aidan Roberts (Belles Will Ring, The Maple Trail) on electric guitar and backing vocals.
In March 2012, Lane covered The Black Keys' track, "Gold on the Ceiling", in a live performance on radio station Triple J's program, Like a Version.
As from July 2011, Lane uses a 1957 guitar named Betty, a 1966 electric Gibson named BoDidd (after Bo Diddley) and an unnamed 1960 archtop guitar. The album track, "Betty Baby", is dedicated to the guitar.

Live

In February 2012 she opened for Icehouse and Hall & Oates at a Day on the Green performance.

Collaborations

Also in 2011, Lane collaborated with fellow singer-songwriter, Clare Bowditch, the pair co-wrote and performed, "Now You're Home", which was issued by Bowditch as a single and on a seven-track extended play, Are You Ready Yet?. Bowditch explained her concept "sometimes, songwriting needs to be scary in order to be good. With this in mind, I decided in February that I would turn my hand to co-writing with some of my favourite Australian artists. I wanted the songs to sound glorious to the ear, and leave people feeling uplifted, rather than analytical. The Are You Ready Yet EP is a taste of where this experiment took me: into the homes of people like Gotye and Lanie Lane, and then straight into the studio to lay down the things we had written together". In June and July, Lane and Bowditch performed together on the Winter Secrets Tour.

Recognition

At the APRA Music Awards of 2012, Lane was nominated four times, and her song "(Oh Well) That's What You Get (Falling in Love with a Cowboy)" was performed by Kram (Spiderbait).
