Music and film

Nigeria has had a huge role in the development of various genres of music including African Music, West African Highlife, Afrobeat, and Palm Wine music, which fuses native rhythms with techniques that have been linked to the Congo, Brazil, Cuba, Jamaica and worldwide.
Many late 20th century musicians such as Fela Kuti have famously fused cultural elements of various indigenous music with American Jazz and Soul to form Afrobeat which has in turn influenced Hip hop music.

The Nigerian video-film industry is known as Nollywood, which is now the second-largest producer of movies in the world . Many of the film studios are based in Lagos and Enugu, and the industry is now a very lucrative income for these cities. Nigerian cinema is Africa's largest movie industry in terms of both value and the number of movies produced per year. Although Nigerian films have been produced since the 1960s, the rise of affordable digital filming and editing technologies has stimulated the country's video film industry. The name Nollywood, was derived as a play on Hollywood in the same manner as Bollywood."Nollywood:  Lights, camera, Africa", The Economist, 18 December 2010, pp. 85–88.
