[[Middle-distance running]]

Middle-distance running events are track races longer than sprints, up to 3000 metres. The standard middle distances are the 800 metres, 1500 metres and mile run, although the 3000 metres may also be classified as a middle-distance event. Encyclopædia Britannica.

Events

600 yards

600 m

This middle distance length is rather uncommon, and is mainly run by sprinters wishing to test their endurances at a longer distance. Like other middle distance races, it evolved from the 600 yard race.  The 600 m is also used as an early season stepping stone by 800 m runners before they have reached full race fitness.  The record at this distance is for men:
For women:

800 m

The 800 m consists of two laps around a standard 400 m track, and has always been an Olympic event. It was included in the first women's track programme in 1928, but suspended until 1960 because of shock and the exhaustion it caused the competitors. Without the benefits of modern training, men of the era were, in contrast, expected to run themselves to complete exhaustion during competitions. 
The current record is for men:
For women:

1000 m

This distance is not commonly raced, though it is more common than the 500 m event is for sprinters. This is commonly raced as an indoor men's heptathlon event, or as an indoor high school event. In 1881, Lon Myers set what was then a world record at 1000 yards, running it in 2:13.0.  The record at this distance for men is:
For women:

1200 m

Three laps.  A distance seldom raced on its own, but commonly raced as part of the Distance Medley Relay.

1500 m

Also known as the metric mile, this is a premier middle-distance race, covering three and three-quarter laps around a standard Olympic-sized track. In recent years, races over this distance have become more of a prolonged sprint, with each lap averaging 55 seconds for the world record performance by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco in 1998 at Rome (two 1:50 s 800 m performances back to back). Thus, speed is necessary, and it seems that the more aerobic conditioning, the better. This is a difficult distance at which to compete mentally, in addition to being one of the more tactical middle-distance track events. The distance is often witness to some of the most tactical, physical races in the sport, as many championship races are won in the final few metres. The record at this distance for men is:
For women:

1600 m

At exactly four laps of a normal 400 m track, this distance is raced as a near replacement for the mile (it is, in fact, 9.344 m, about 30.6 feet, shorter; however, it is still colloquially referred to as "the mile"). The 1600 meters is the official distance for this range of races in US High Schools.  The 1500 m, however, is the most common distance run at the college and international levels. 
The final leg of a Distance medley relay is 1600 metres.  While that race is rarely run outside of high school and collegiate invitational competition, it has been held at the international level.
An accurate way to run an actual mile on a metric track is to run the additional 9.344 meters before starting the first marked 400 meter lap. Many tracks, especially high-level tracks, will have a waterfall starting line drawn 9.344 meters back for this purpose. Otherwise, on a metric track, there will be a relay zone 10 meters before the common start/finish line, frequently marked by a triangle pointed toward the finish.  In many configurations, that triangle is about half a meter wide, making its point extremely close to the mile start line, which would be slightly less than two feet from the marked relay zone (the widest part of the triangle, or line).trackinfo.html TrackInfo Marking guide

Mile

This length of middle-distance race, 1760 yards, (1609.344 metres), is very common in countries that do not use the metric system, and is still often referred to as the "Blue Riband" of the track.
When the International Amateur Athletic Federation decided in 1976 to recognize only world records for metric distances, it made an exception for the mile and records are kept to this day. 
Historically, the mile took the place that the 1500 m has today. It is still raced on the world class level, but usually only at select occasions, like the famous Wanamaker Mile held annually at the Millrose Games. Running a mile in less than four minutes is a famously difficult achievement, long thought impossible by the scientific community. The first man to break the four-minute barrier was Englishman Roger Bannister at Oxford in 1954.  The record at this distance for men is:
For women:

2000 m

For women:

3000 m

For women:

3200 m

At exactly 8 laps on a standard 400 m track, this event is typically run only in American high schools along with the 1600 m. It is colloquially called the "two-mile", as the distance is only 18.688 metres shorter than two miles. In college, the typical runner of this event would convert to the 5,000 metre run (or potentially the 3,000 metre run during indoor season). It should be noted that in most Eastern-American high schools, colleges, and middle schools, this event is usually considered a long distance event, depending on the region. It is the longest distance run in most high school competitions.  Kentucky High School Athletic Association, Accessed May 7, 2010

Two Miles

This length of long middle-distance or short long-distance race was 3520 yards, (3218.688 metres).
Historically, the 2 mile took the place that the 3000 m and the 3200 m have today. The first man to break the four-minute barrier on both miles for a total of less than 8 minutes was Daniel Komen in 1997, and his time of 7:58.61 remains a world record. The record at this distance for men is:
For women:

2,000 metre steeplechase

Another race only run in high school or Masters meets. The typical specialist in this event would move up to the 3000m steeplechase in college.

3,000 metre steeplechase

For women:

United States and Japan youth running

In the United States, the 3000 m is more common at the high school and collegiate levels (along with the US two mile). In Japan, the 800, 1500 and 3000 metre events are competed in both genders for junior high school and high school, except that high school boys jump to 5000 metres. Both 3000 and 5000 metre distances are sometimes described as long distanceYamashita Makoto, Long Distance: Preparation Season Training, Track and Field Magazine (Japan), Vol 56 No 3, February 2006, page 220. but also frequently as middle distance,2008 High School Middle Distance Detailed List, All Japan High  School Ekiden Spectator's Guide, January Supplement, Track and Field Magazine (Japan), Vol 59 No 1, January 2009, pages 87-90.2008 Japan and Junior High School Middle Distance Top 100,  Track and Field Magazine (Japan), Vol 59 No 1, January 2009, pages 152-153. depending on the context. From the perspective of a longer race like a half marathon, marathon or relays such as the ekiden relay, the 5000 metre race might be viewed as middle distance.
The tables below do not focus on record times but rather on the performance of many runners in a given year (in this case, 2007 and 2008). These are the top 100 (or even 500) junior high school and high school runners in Japan and the USA.

800 metres

1500 metres

A few states of the USA use this distance, among them Oregon, Florida, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.

1600 metres

3000 metres

A few states of the USA use this distance, among them Oregon, Massachusetts, Florida, and Rhode Island.

3200 metres

2000 metre steeplechase

In the USA, the steeplechase is still relatively uncommon in high school. One example is New York state, where high school boys compete in the 3000 metre steeplechase and the high school girls compete in the 2000 metre steeplechase. In many states, both boys and girls compete in the 2000 metre steeple chase.

3000 metre steeplechase

5000 metres

(Not a middle distance event)
Japanese secondary school boys regularly run 5000 metres on the track rather than 3000 meters. USA high school boys rarely run this distance except during cross country.
