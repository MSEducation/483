History

The modern Tunisian Army had its origins in the time of the French Protectorate (1881–1956). During this period, Tunisians were recruited in significant numbers into the French Army, serving as tirailleurs (infantry) and spahis (cavalry). These units saw active service in Europe during both World Wars, as well as in Indo-China prior to 1954. The only exclusively Tunisian military force permitted under French rule was the Beylical Guard.page 710 "World Armies, John Keegan, ISBN 0-333-17236-1

Following independence

In 1956 9,500 men who served in the French Army and the Beylical Guard, made possible the rapid establishment of a combined-arms regiment, which was decided on June 21, 1956. The necessary equipment was made available to the young state while 25 officers, 250 NCOs and 1,250 soldiers were transferred from the French army to the Tunisian army.

On June 30, 1956, the Tunisian army was officially founded by decree. 
It initially had about 1,300 officers and men transferred from French Army service, plus 850 former members of the Beylical Guard. Approximately 4,000 Tunisian soldiers continued in French Army service until 1958, when the majority transferred to the Tunisian Army, which reached a strength of over 6,000 that year.
The integration of the Beylical Guard, intake of conscripts for military service, made mandatory in January 1957, and recall of reservists allowed the army to grow from three to twelve battalions and 2300 to 20000 men in 1961. Sixty per cent of those forces were used for monitoring borders.
Units saw action first against the French Army in 1958 after the intrusion of the latter in the south trying to chase the National Liberation Army (Algeria). In 1961 clashes occurred with French forces based at Bizerte. More than 600 men fell in battle against the French forces. The French evacuated the base after subsequent negotiations with the Tunisian Government.
The Navy, founded in 1958, received its first ship in the fall of 1959. As for the Air Force, it acquired its first combat aircraft in 1960 . While suppliers of the Tunisian army are numerous, United States remain the largest suppliers of army and air. As for management training, once exercised by the French and American military schools, it is gradually assigned to newly established military schools.
The January 10, 1957, a law prohibits any military to be a member of a group or a political party. However, the 7 November 1987, the Prime Minister, General Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali took power. Abdelhamid Escheikh and Mustapha Bouaziz, senior officers, subsequently occupy ministerial posts.
On April 30, 2002, at around 18.15, the direction of the Army - Brigadier General Abdelaziz Skik who led the Tunisian contingent to Cambodia, two colonels - majors, three colonels, four majors, two lieutenants and a sergeant-major - disappeared in a helicopter crash near the town of Medjez el-Bab.Abdelaziz Barrouhi , "The army in mourning, "Jeune Afrique", May 13, 2002 
Tunisia has contributed military forces to United Nations peacekeeping missions, including an army company to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) during the Rwandan Genocide. In his book Shake Hands with the Devil, Canadian force commander Roméo Dallaire gave the Tunisian soldiers high credit for their work and effort in the conflict and referred to them as his "ace in the hole".
During the 2011 Libyan civil war, Tunisian forces, mostly border guards, saw some limited action when fighting between Libyan rebels and loyalist soldiers spilled over the border and clashes ensued between the Libyan Army and the Tunisian Army, resulting in at least one Tunisian civilian being injured by a Libyan rocket.
