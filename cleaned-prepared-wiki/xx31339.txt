Interstate 97 (I-97) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs entirely within Maryland. The intrastate Interstate runs  from U.S. Route 50 and US 301 in Parole near Annapolis north to I-695 and I-895 in Brooklyn Park near Baltimore. I-97 is the shortest 2-digit mainline Interstate and the only intracounty 2-digit Interstate in the contiguous United States. The Interstate is the primary highway between Baltimore and Annapolis. I-97 connects Annapolis with Baltimore–Washington International Airport and links the northern Anne Arundel County communities of Crownsville, Millersville, Severna Park, Glen Burnie, and Ferndale.
I-97 was constructed along the corridor of Maryland Route 3 (MD 3) between Millersville and Ferndale and MD 178 between Parole and Millersville. From Millersville to south of Glen Burnie, the Interstate closely follows the former course of MD 3, which was built in the late 1910s and early 1920s and expanded to a divided highway in the late 1950s. North of there, the highway follows the Glen Burnie Bypass, a freeway built in the mid-1950s. The segment of I-97 from Millersville to Crownsville originated as a two-lane portion of MD 32 in the early 1970s. The Interstate was introduced in 1979 after the state of Maryland successfully obtained Interstate mileage for a Baltimore–Annapolis freeway from the federal government. The state decided to build the highway along I-97's current corridor rather than along the MD 2 corridor, which has partial freeway access via MD 10.
Construction on I-97 began in the late 1980s with new construction from US 50 and US 301 to Crownsville. The Crownsville–Millersville segment of MD 32 was expanded and incorporated into the Interstate and the MD 3–MD 32 junction was upgraded. The portion of the MD 3 corridor from Millersville to south of Glen Burnie was upgraded on the spot to Interstate Highway standards in the early 1990s, after which MD 3 was truncated at Millersville. I-97's interchange with I-695 was rebuilt in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Glen Burnie Bypass was upgraded and expanded to six lanes in the mid-1990s. The complex process included reconstruction of several interchanges; the last interchange to be reconstructed was upgraded in the mid-2000s.

Route description

I-97 begins at US 50 and US 301 (John Hanson Highway), which run concurrently with unsigned I-595, on the edge of the community of Parole west of Annapolis. The freeways meet at a semi-directional T interchange; the ramp from I-97 to eastbound US 50 and US 301 merges with a collector-distributor road that extends east to that freeway's interchange with MD 665 (Aris T. Allen Boulevard). I-97 heads northwest as a four-lane freeway with a speed limit of . The freeway crosses over MD 450 (Defense Highway) and passes through a forested, rural area on the south and west sides of Crownsville. North of Crownsville, I-97 has a partial interchange that comprises a pair of long ramps to MD 178 (Generals Highway); the interchange allows access from southbound I-97 to MD 178 and from the state highway to the northbound Interstate. I-97 gains an extra lane in each direction from the MD 178 ramps; those extra lanes leave at the freeway's partial interchange with the eastern end of MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). The Interstate curves northeast and then has a complementary interchange with the northern end of MD 3 (Robert Crain Highway). The two state highway meet each other at a six-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange immediately to the west of I-97's sweeping curve, allowing for all movements between the three highways.
The Interstate continues north as a six-lane freeway and is closely paralleled by Veterans Highway through a suburban area on the western edge of Severna Park. The highways cross Severn Run before they diverge slightly at the Interstate's partial cloverleaf interchange with Benfield Boulevard; access from northbound I-97 to the crossroad is via Veterans Highway. I-97 and Veterans Highway continue to parallel each other to the latter highway's northern end at I-97's partial cloverleaf interchange with the southern end of MD 3 Business (Robert Crain Highway) and New Cut Road. The interchange includes a flyover ramp from northbound I-97 to northbound Veterans Highway just south of its intersection with MD 3 Business. The freeway continues north through Glen Burnie and meets MD 174 (Quarterfield Road) at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange and MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway) at a cloverstack interchange that has flyover exit ramps from both directions of I-97.
I-97 temporarily gains two extra lanes in each direction between MD 100 and its partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 176 (Dorsey Road). Access from the southbound Interstate to MD 176 is via MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard), which forms part of the Airport Loop surrounding Baltimore–Washington International Airport. I-97 continues through Ferndale, where it crosses over the Glen Burnie branch of the Baltimore Light Rail immediately before the highway's four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 648 (Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard), which provides access to the transit line's terminal station, Cromwell Station / Glen Burnie. I-97's final interchange is with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). The interchange includes a flyover ramp from I-97 to westbound I-695; that ramp and the one from eastbound I-695 to I-97 merge on the inside of the two carriageways of the Beltway. The Interstate drops to four lanes and reaches its northern terminus just north of the loop ramp from westbound I-695 to I-97 in Brooklyn Park. The highway continues as I-895A, a pair of ramps that merge with the spur from I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) to MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway). The continuation from I-97 includes a ramp to westbound I-695 that allows access to the Beltway's interchange with MD 648.

History

Predecessor highways

The first modern highway along the path of what is now I-97 followed the corridor from New Cut Road to south of the intersection of MD 178 and Veterans Highway at Dorrs Corner. This highway was intended as a second route from Glen Burnie to Annapolis to complement the highway along the east side of the Severn River; this western route later became known as General's Highway, a name still applied to its MD 178 portion. Construction of this highway was underway by 1919. The new highway was completed as a gravel road from New Cut Road to north of Benfield and as a concrete road through Benfield and across Severn Run to near Dorrs Corner by 1921. In 1922, this highway was designated part of Robert Crain Highway, a new highway to connect the Baltimore area with Southern Maryland. The Glen Burnie–Dorrs Corner portion of the new highway was reconstructed and completed as a concrete road from Glen Burnie south through Millersville by 1923. Robert Crain Highway became part of MD 3 in 1927 and then US 301 in 1939 when the U.S. Highway was extended from Virginia to Baltimore. MD 3 was reconstructed in 1933 and 1934. The reconstruction eliminated several dangerous curves, particularly near Severn Run, and expanded the highway from a width of . Veterans Highway follows much of that early 1930s course.
The next portion of I-97 predecessor highway was built as the four-lane Glen Burnie Bypass from Robert Crain Highway and New Cut Road north to the Baltimore Beltway. The four-lane freeway was placed under construction in 1954 and opened in autumn 1956. US 301 was moved onto the bypass and the adjacent portion of the Beltway in 1957. When US 301 was relocated to its present course from Bowie to the Eastern Shore in 1959, the freeway was redesignated MD 3. The small portion of I-97 north of the Beltway was added to the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel project as a direct connection between the Glen Burnie Bypass and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway's southern approach from MD 2 in 1955. This segment was completed and opened with the tunnel and its approach highways in November 1957. The Glen Burnie Bypass was constructed with five interchanges: a partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 3 Business and New Cut Road; a tighter four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 174; a diamond interchange at MD 176; the current four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 648; and a half-cloverleaf interchange at I-695 allowing full access between the Glen Burnie Bypass and Beltway but no access between the Beltway and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway.
US 301 was expanded to a divided highway from the southern end of the Glen Burnie Bypass to Benfield in 1956 and 1957. The U.S. Highway's second set of lanes was constructed from Benfield to Millersville between 1957 and 1959. The second set of lanes was built on the west side of what became a very wide median, which allowed businesses to site themselves in the median between the northbound and southbound lanes. A pair of ramps between the Glen Burnie Bypass and MD 177's freeway southern bypass of Glen Burnie (now MD 100) were added in 1964. The first section of highway south of Dorrs Corner was built as a two-lane segment of MD 32 from east of Odenton to MD 178 in Crownsville. The highway used what are now the ramps of I-97's partial interchange with MD 178 and had a five-ramp interchange with MD 3 in Millersville that lacked access from northbound MD 3 to eastbound MD 32 and from westbound MD 32 to southbound MD 3.

Interstate designation and construction

Despite the existence or upcoming construction of two divided highway corridors between Baltimore and Annapolis, a freeway connecting I-695 and US 50 was proposed as early as 1956 in the form of the Arundel Expressway, which would relieve congestion on MD 2. The portion of the Arundel Expressway that is today MD 10 was constructed from I-695 to MD 648 in Pasadena between 1970 and 1978. MD 10 was proposed to continued south of Pasadena as a toll road to US 50, but the section of the freeway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975. MD 10 was completed to its present end in Pasadena in 1991. The state of Maryland unsuccessfully petitioned the Federal Highway Administration for an Interstate designation for a Baltimore–Annapolis freeway after passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. However, the state was successful in obtaining Interstate mileage for the Baltimore–Annapolis corridor through the 1968 Howard–Cramer amendment, which provided for minor adjustments to the Interstate System if no additional costs were incurred. Much of the mileage of what became I-97 was reallocated from canceled Interstate Highways in Baltimore and the Washington area.
With Interstate funding obtained, the Maryland State Highway Administration commissioned the Baltimore–Annapolis Transportation Corridor Study in 1973 to figure out, among other things, the best route for the Baltimore–Annapolis Interstate. The study discovered a western route following the MD 3 and MD 178 corridors would be less disruptive and require fewer acquisitions of homes and businesses compared to an extension of the Arundel Expressway south along the MD 2 corridor. Subsequently, in June 1979, the Maryland State Highway Administration announced plans for I-97. The 1979 plan was for I-97 to include its current route plus US 50 from Parole west to I-95 (Capital Beltway). That proposal included two auxiliary Interstate highways. I-197 would follow US 50 and US 301 east from I-97 to just west of the Severn River. I-297 would follow MD 3 between a pair of intersections with I-97 in Millersville and Bowie. In 1983, an updated proposal featured I-97 along its current course and I-297 along the MD 3 corridor; the east–west segment of I-97 and I-197 were replaced by I-68. The 1983 concept of I-68 became unsigned I-595 and I-68 was applied to the National Freeway in Western Maryland in 1991. I-297 was approved as an Interstate corridor under the Howard–Cramer provisions in 1975 but was withdrawn by request of the state of Maryland in 1983.
The first portion of I-97 proper to be constructed was the section south of Millersville, which was placed under construction by 1987. The first section of the highway, from US 50 and US 301 to Millersville Road west of the MD 178 interchange, opened in December 1987. I-97 was extended north through the reconstructed interchange at MD 3 and MD 32 to the intersection of MD 3 and MD 178 at Dorrs Corner in April 1989. The interchange at I-97's southern terminus was originally constructed as a partial interchange, with I-97 tying into what are now the collector-distributor lanes of US 50 and US 301. The ramps from eastbound US 50 and US 301 to I-97 and from I-97 to the westbound U.S. Highways were added in 1993.

Reconstruction of existing highway

Reconstruction of the MD 3 divided highway and the Glen Burnie Bypass was a complex operation that involved many temporary openings, lane shifts, construction of new roadways, and reconstruction of existing roadways over several phases over several years. The first improvement was the reorganization of the I-695 interchange between 1989 and 1991. The modern ramps from I-97 to westbound I-695 and from eastbound I-695 to I-97 were built, eastbound I-695's ramp over these two ramps was constructed, and the loop ramp from I-97 to westbound I-695 was removed. I-97 from its interchange with MD 648 to the new Beltway ramps was expanded to six lanes starting in May 1993. The widening work was completed in August 1995. Part of the functionality of the loop ramp was restored in October 1995 when another ramp from the Harbor Tunnel Thruway approach to westbound I-695 was added to allow access from I-97 to MD 648.
Reconstruction of the MD 3 divided highway from Millersville to MD 3 Business began in 1989 with construction of the flyover ramp from northbound I-97 to Veterans Highway just south of MD 3 Business. I-97's original bridge over MD 3 Business was replaced with a wider overpass in 1990; the Benfield Boulevard interchange was built the same year. The southbound MD 3 roadway was rebuilt in place as the southbound lanes of I-97. New northbound lanes were built immediately to the east of the southbound lanes. In February 1991, the new northbound lanes opened and access from I-97 to Veterans Highway was removed at Dorrs Corner. The old northbound lanes were reconstructed and re-purposed as a two-lane road later that year. MD 3 was truncated at Millersville in 1991; signage for MD 3 on I-695 was removed by 1993.
Widening of I-97 from MD 3 Business to MD 648 began in November 1993. The new lanes opened from MD 176 to MD 648 in March 1996. The final segment to be widened, from MD 174 to MD 176, was completed in July 1997. The northern half of the MD 176 interchange was reconstructed as part of the latter project. The new loop ramp from northbound I-97 to westbound MD 176 and the new ramp from MD 176 to northbound I-97 were completed in 1995. The ramp from southbound I-97 to MD 176 was removed during the widening project. The pair of ramps between southbound I-97 and MD 162 to replace the removed ramp were completed in 1998. The widening of the Interstate from MD 174 to MD 176 included the highway's interchange with MD 100, which opened from I-97 west to MD 295 in November 1996. The final piece of construction on I-97 was the reconstruction of its interchange with MD 174, which began in 2002 and concluded in 2005.
