Series history

Following an abortive one-season attempt by Universal Television to offer a three-series Hollywood Premiere NetworkHollywood Premiere Network was an early attempt by Universal Television to create an ad hoc syndication network. Although not a "real" network with affiliates and the like, they were ahead of their time and would have better success with the Universal Action Pack later in the 1990s. The series aired in many of the stations that would later become either UPN or WB affiliates. She-Wolf of London premiered along with two other shows, Shades of L.A. and They Came from Outer Space on October 9, 1990 in 1990-91, in 1994, the Action Pack initially ran a series of television movies, which led to the run of several television shows the following year. Issue Three. November 1996. From January-June 1995, the series included Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Vanishing Son.Bevis King's Xena: Warrior Princess website  After Hercules ended its run in January 2000, the Universal Action Pack launched the Back2Back Action Hour and picked up two thirty minute series: Jack of All Trades and Cleopatra 2525 to air alongside Xena.  SciFi. January 24, 2000. The lineup lasted until January 2001. For the final six months of the package, Jack of All Trades was dropped and Cleopatra 2525 was increased to an hour long show. 
After Xena, the most successful series on the Action Pack, completed airing its final season's reruns in the summer of 2001, Cleopatra 2525 also stopped production and the Action Pack series was discontinued.
