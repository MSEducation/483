Adriano Leite Ribeiro (born February 17, 1982 in Rio de Janeiro), commonly known as simply Adriano, is a Brazilian footballer who is currently free agent. A striker, Adriano's career has been marked by inconsistency.  His main titles are four scudettos for Internazionale and a FIFA Confederations Cup and Copa América for Brazil.

Club career

Early career

Adriano started his career in 1999 on Flamengo's youth squad and earned promotion to the senior squad one year later. He made his team debut on February 2, 2000, a Torneio Rio-São Paulo match against Botafogo. He scored a goal against São Paulo in the same competition 4 days later.
Despite signing a two-year contract with Flamengo in June 2000, he secured a move to Internazionale for the 2001–02 season. Inter sold another half of Vampeta to PSG (ultimately to Flamengo from PSG for undisclosed fee) for €9.757 million in exchange for Adriano who was valued €13.189 million.FC Internazionale Milano SpA Report and Accounts on June 30, 2002

Parma

Adriano was loaned out to league rival Fiorentina for the 2001–02 season,

Inter return

Adriano returned to the San Siro in 2004 on a 4½-year contract, for about €23.4 million
Following the signing of the new deal, Adriano's future at Inter suffered due to poor performances, fueled by questions and speculation regarding his work ethic, which was called into question when he was twice caught partying at nightclubs during the 2006–07 campaign. Brazilian coach Dunga did not call Adriano up for a friendly against Ecuador on October 10, 2006, and called for him to "change his behavior" and "focus on football". On February 18, 2007, Adriano skipped a team practice due to effects from a lengthy celebration of his birthday the night before, which led to Inter manager Roberto Mancini benching him for the team's Champions League match against Valencia and subsequent Serie A fixture against Catania.

=Stint at São Paulo=

On November 16, 2007, Inter owner Massimo Moratti sent Adriano on unpaid leave to his native Brazil for the second time in eighteen months, where he attended São Paulo's training center, due to his poor physical condition and a past battle with alcoholism. Though his agent denied Adriano's desire to return to Brazilian club football, Adriano claimed he was willing to leave Inter in the January transfer window in search of regular playing time, with the Italian press stating interest from West Ham United and Manchester City.
Inter finalized a deal on December 19 to loan Adriano to São Paulo for the remainder of the 2007–08 season in order to allow him to compete in the 2007–08 Copa Libertadores. São Paulo fans were soon seen standing in long lines to buy his new number 10 jersey at the team's official merchandise retailer after Adriano was introduced and his shirt was unveiled at a team press conference. Adriano celebrated his competitive debut with São Paulo by scoring both goals in their 2–1 victory over Guaratinguetá on the opening day of the 2008 Paulista tournament.
Adriano was sent off after headbutting Santos fullback Domingos on February 10, 2008, and was suspended for two matches after initially risking a suspension of eighteen months.
São Paulo sporting director Carlos Augusto de Barros e Silva announced on June 17 that Adriano was returning to Inter ahead of schedule. "We have a balanced squad and it was better for Adriano to go back, given that we won't be able to count on him for the rest of the campaign."

=2008–09 season=

Adriano was a regular goalscorer in the early stages of the Serie A 2008–09 campaign, reaching a combined total of 100 domestic goals in the Italian Serie A and the Brazilian Série A. On October 22, 2008, Adriano scored the winner in a 1–0 win over Anorthosis Famagusta, and, with this goal, Adriano scored his 18th Champions League goal, and 70th for the club.
In December, Internazionale allowed him special dispensation to return to Brazil over the winter break earlier than planned. Inter confirmed on April 4 that Adriano had not returned from international duty with Brazil and had signed no contract with the club.

Flamengo

Adriano signed a one-year contract for Brazilian club Flamengo on May 6, 2009, the club with which he started his career.
On January 31, 2010, Adriano scored his second hat-trick since his return, this time in a 5–3 comeback win in the Fla-Flu derby against rivals Fluminense in the 2010 Rio de Janeiro State League. After the match Adriano said about his teammate Vágner Love: "We play for each other, we're both top level players and we're chasing the same objective, to get to the World Cup".

Roma

On June 8, 2010, Italian Serie A club Roma announced that Adriano had signed a three-year contract with the club, effective on July 1, earning a gross annual salary of €5M.

Corinthians

On March 25, 2011, he signed a one-year deal with Corinthians. His first goal for Corinthians came on October 20 in the home game versus Atlético Mineiro, and was the winning goal that made the game 2-1 and gave Corinthians a two-point lead in the Championship with only two games remaining.
On March 12, 2012, Adriano was released by Corinthians, after his irregular appearances and lack of interest.

Back to Flamengo

Adriano returned to Flamengo after training with the club for months. He signed a contract until the end of 2012 but failed to appear in any matches.

Return to football

On January 6, 2014, Adriano returned to professional football after being without a club for over a year. He signed a contract with Campeonato Brasileiro Série A side Atlético Paranaense. Adriano had been training and assisiting within coaching duties at Atletico Paranaense since the end of 2013.
On April 11, 2014, Atlético Paranaense terminated his contract after a three-month spell. The team had been eliminated from the Copa Libertadores two days prior, and Adriano missed two training sessions the days after, without giving an explanation.

International career

Adriano made his first international appearance for Brazil in a World Cup qualifier against Colombia on November 15, 2000 at the age of 18. He was often considered as the long-term successor to Ronaldo. He scored his first international goal on June 11, 2003 in a friendly match against Nigeria. Later that month, he was included in Brazil team for 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. He led Brazil's attack alongside Ronaldinho in the absence of Ronaldo. He appeared in all three matches and scored two goals as Brazil was eliminated in the group stage. He missed 2004 CONMEBOL Men Pre-Olympic Tournament due to injuries.
The following year, he was included in Brazil team for Copa América 2004. Brazil won the cup and Adriano won the Golden Boot as the competition's leading scorer with seven goals. In the final match against Argentina, Adriano dramatically scored the equalizer in the 93rd minute. The match went on to penalties and Brazil finally won 4–2. After the match, coach Carlos Alberto Parreira singled out Adriano as a very important factor in winning the title.
In 2005, Adriano once again has an impressive tournament with Brazil, this time in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. Adriano was named Player of the Tournament and received the Golden Boot Award as the competition's leading scorer with five goals. In the final, he steered Brazil to victory, scoring two goals in a 4–1 victory over Argentina.
Adriano was called up for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal on June 18, 2006 in a 2–0 win against Australia and his second in a 3–0 victory against Ghana. Despite his two goals, Adriano's World Cup campaign was considered a disappointment, as he managed only five shots all tournament, while Brazil as a whole were unable to find the right mix between defence and attack, ultimately being eliminated in the quarter-finals by France.
After the disappointing World Cup, Adriano's international career declined due to a series of poor club performances and personal problems. Adriano has featured once for Brazil under Dunga's regime since the conclusion of the World Cup, as a halftime substitute during a 2–0 friendly loss to Portugal on February 6, 2007. In 2008, Adriano finally regained his form during his stint at São Paulo FC and earned a recall to the national team. On October 10, 2008, Adriano scored his first international goal in two years in a World Cup qualifier against Venezuela.
He was a regular member of Brazil squad during World Cup qualification, and was call-up to the match against Republic of Ireland.
However, he is one of the two players dropped from that 24-men squad, which rest of the 22 players were included in Dunga's provisional 23-men 2010 FIFA World Cup squad,
The other one dropped was Carlos Eduardo, who call-up to Ireland friendly to replace the original member Elano who injured. The backup of injured Luís Fabiano on that match, Grafite, instead occupied Adriano's place.
