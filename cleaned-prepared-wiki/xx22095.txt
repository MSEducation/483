Francesco Zuccarelli RA (15 August 1702 – 30 December 1788) was an  Italian painter of the late Baroque period.

Rome and Tuscany (1702–32)

Born at Pitigliano, in southern Tuscany, Zuccarelli began his apprenticeship in Rome in c. 1713–14 with the portrait painters Giovanni Maria Morandi (1622–1717) and his pupil Pietro Nelli (1672–1740),Tassi, Francesco Maria Vite de' pittori, scultori e archittetti bergamaschi. Vol II. Bergamo, 1793. p. 86. Tassi died in 1782, and the work was published posthumously. under whose tutelage he learned the elements of design while absorbing the lessons of Roman classicism.

Francesco completed his first commission in Pitigliano in the years 1724–27, a pair of chapel altarpieces. With the sponsorship of the Florentine art connoisseur, Francisco Maria Niccolò Gabburri (1676–1742), in the late 1720s and early 1730s Zuccarelli focused on etching.  He eventually produced at least 43 prints, the majority consisting of two series which recorded the deteriorating frescoes of Giovanni da San Giovanni (1592–1636) and Andrea del Sarto (1486–1531). During his Tuscan period, though preoccuppied with figurative subjects, he began to experiment with drawings in landscape, and according to non-contemporary sources his introduction to the latter genre was through the Roman landscape painter and etcher Paolo Anesi (1697–1773). La storia pittorica della Italia inferiore, o sia delle scuole fiorentina, senese, romana, napolitana. Firenze, Stamperia di Ant. Gius. Pagani, 1792; and Lanzi, L. Storia pittorica della Italia dal Risorgimento delle Belle Arti fin presso la fine del XVIII secolo. Bassano, Remondini, 1795–1796.  There is a difference in wording between the 1792 and 1795 editions. In 1792, Lanzi wrote "Nel 1788 morì in Firenze di anni 86 Francesco Zuccherelli di Pitigliano, ammaestrato nella capitale (=Florence) dall'Anesi, poi in Roma dal Morandi e dal Nelli" (p. 147); then, in 1795, "Molti quadri di vedute campestri son per Firenze dipinte da Paolo Anesi, e ve n'è copia anche in Roma. Da questo fu incamminato nell'arte Francesco Zuccherelli..." (p. 270). See note on p. 319 in Michel, Olivier; "Recherches Biographiques sur Paolo Anesi." In: Vivre et Peindre à Rome au XVIIIe Siėcle'. Ècole Française de Rome, Palais Farnèse, 1996. It seems likely that Zuccarelli already knew Anesi from Rome, or met him in Florence through their common friend Gabburi, whose collection of paintings were devoted almost exclusively to landscape and included five by Anesi, and notably, in light of later developments, four from Marco Ricci. Both Zuccarelli and Anesi exhibited at the Accademici del Disegno on the occasion of the festival of St. Luke in Florence in 1729.

Venice and two stays in England (1732–71)

In Bologna, Zuccarelli published a book of prints dedicated to an unknown Florentine friend. Zuccarelli relocated to Venice. See Spadotto (2007), pp. 12–15. While continuing to paint religious and mythological works, he increasingly devoted his output to landscapes, his style at first taking after that of Alessandro Magnasco, and more lastingly, of Marco Ricci. Prior to his arrival in the Republic, the death of Marco Ricci in 1730 had created an opening in the field of landscape painting amid a marketplace crowded with history painters, and Zuccarelli's unique blend of countryside and Arcadia quickly achieved success.  Francesco brought a more mellow and airy palette to the typically Venetian colors,  Towards 1750, when Zuccarelli reached his peak, his paint handling was very responsive to mood, bright with regard to color, thinly laid on and yet vibrantly effective.
Francesco travelled to England to 1752, where his decorative talent resulted in diverse work, including the design of tapestries with the weaver Paul Saunders at Holkham Hall. before his departure for Italy. In the same year, King George III acquired twenty-five of his works through the purchase of much of Consul Smith's extensive art collection and library in Venice.

Macmillan: London, 2002. but Zuccarelli was soon induced to journey back to London in 1765 by his friend Algarotti's bequest of a cameo and group of drawings made to Lord Chatham. On this second visit to England, he was lauded by the English nobility and critics alike, and invited to exhibit at leading art societies; moreover, King George III is said to have commissioned the out-sized painting River Landscape with the Finding of Moses (1768).H.

(Source: Georgian Papers in the Royal Archives at Windsor, 17253; cited by Levey, who suggests the pictures may have been A Harbour Scene with Ruins, Figures and Cattle, and Landscape with a Temple and Cascade, both at Windsor Castle).   Francesco Zuccarelli was a founding member, in 1768, of the Royal Academy of Arts.

Final years in Italy (1771–88)

Upon his return to Italy in 1771, Zuccarelli was soon afterward elected President of the Venetian Academy. The work of his late maturity can broadly be characterized as "neo-Riccian", for in this period the artist's style recalls the precision of his youthful emulation of Marco Ricci.  Francesco Zuccarelli eventually settled in Florence, and he died there in 1788.

Reputation

Francesco Zuccarelli was one of the few Venetian painters of his era to win universal acclaim, even from critics who rejected the concept of Arcadia. Patrons and Painters: A Study in the Relations between Italian Art and Society in the Age of the Baroque. 2nd ed. Yale University Press: New Haven and London, 1986. He was especially popular among the followers of Rousseau.  Francesco Maria Tassi (1716–1782), in his Lives of the Painters, Sculptors, and Architects of Bergamo remarks that Zuccarelli paints "landscapes with the most charming figures and thus excels not only artists of modern times but rivals the great geniuses of the past; for no one previously knew how to combine the delights of an harmonious ground with figures gracefully posed and represented in the most natural colours". Quotation from Zampetti, Pietro (1971). With the move to more representational modes of depicting landscape in the 19th century, a reaction set in, and his works were to be the subject of the most disparaging invective. A reappraisal of the artist began in 1959 with a landmark article by Michael Levey, "Francesco Zuccarelli in England", which helped explain the appeal of his works to his contemporaries by drawing a parallel with the affection of the 18th century English for pastoral poetry. Everyone could recognize a pleasing convention when they saw one, in this case, a fairyland where "the skies are forever blue, the trees forever green." The exaltation of the rural life as a retreat from the noise of urbanity had the sanction of a long and distinguished history; as Levey writes, "Virgil recommended it, Petrarch practiced it, and Zucccarelli illustrated it." Further important contributions to scholarship have been the publication of an artistic biography and sixty paintings by Federico dal Forno in 1994,Dal Forno, Federico. Francesco Zuccarelli pittore paesaggista del Settecento. Arti Grafiche Colombo: Verona, 1994. and more recently, the appearance of a catalogue raisonné. In a wider cultural context, modern historians have considered Zuccarelli to be a figure of interest with his love of escapism, seen as not untypical of the late Baroque.

Identification of works

His paintings, rarely signed with a 'FZ' monogram or signature,Castagno, John. Old Masters: Signatures and Monograms, 1400-born 1800. The Scarecrow Press, Inc: Lanham, Md. & London, 1996. often contain a bottle gourd that was held at the waist by rural Italian women, a punning allusion to his surname, which signifies "little pumpkin"'. The English cyclopædia:a new dictionary of universal knowledge. Bradbury & Evans: London, 1858. A defining touch found consistently across the long span of Francesco Zuccarelli's career is a serene and vaguely sweet expression on the rounded faces of his figures.
