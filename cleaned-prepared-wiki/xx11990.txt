Alternative views

Wave–particle duality is an ongoing conundrum in modern physics.  Most physicists accept wave-particle duality as the best explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena; however, it is not without controversy.  Alternative views are also presented here.  These views are not generally accepted by mainstream physics, but serve as a basis for valuable discussion within the community.

Both-particle-and-wave view

The pilot wave model, originally developed by Louis de Broglie and further developed by David Bohm into the hidden variable theory proposes that there is no duality, but rather a system exhibits both particle properties and wave properties simultaneously, and particles are guided, in a deterministic fashion, by the pilot wave (or its "quantum potential") which will direct them to areas of constructive interference in preference to areas of destructive interference. This idea is held by a significant minority within the physics community.(Buchanan pp. 29–31)
At least one physicist considers the "wave-duality" a misnomer, as L. Ballentine, Quantum Mechanics, A Modern Development, p. 4, explains:
 When first discovered, particle diffraction was a source of great puzzlement. Are "particles" really "waves?" In the early experiments, the diffraction patterns were detected holistically by means of a photographic plate, which could not detect individual particles. As a result, the notion grew that particle and wave properties were mutually incompatible, or complementary, in the sense that different measurement apparatuses would be required to observe them. That idea, however, was only an unfortunate generalization from a technological limitation. Today it is possible to detect the arrival of individual electrons, and to see the diffraction pattern emerge as a statistical pattern made up of many small spots (Tonomura et al., 1989). Evidently, quantum particles are indeed particles, but whose behaviour is very different from classical physics would have us to expect.

Wave-only view

At least one scientist proposes that the duality can be replaced by a "wave-only" view. In his book Collective Electrodynamics: Quantum Foundations of Electromagnetism (2000), Carver Mead purports to analyze the behavior of electrons and photons purely in terms of electron wave functions, and attributes the apparent particle-like behavior to quantization effects and eigenstates. According to reviewer David Haddon:
 Mead has cut the Gordian knot of quantum complementarity. He claims that atoms, with their neutrons, protons, and electrons, are not particles at all but pure waves of matter. Mead cites as the gross evidence of the exclusively wave nature of both light and matter the discovery between 1933 and 1996 of ten examples of pure wave phenomena, including the ubiquitous laser of CD players, the self-propagating electrical currents of superconductors, and the Bose–Einstein condensate of atoms. 
Albert Einstein, who, in his search for a Unified Field Theory, did not accept wave-particle duality, wrote:Paul Arthur Schilpp, ed, Albert Einstein:  Philosopher-Scientist, Open Court (1949), ISBN 0-87548-131-7 , p 51.

The many-worlds interpretation (MWI) is sometimes presented as a waves-only theory, including by its originator, Hugh Everett who referred to MWI as "the wave interpretation".

Neither-wave-nor-particle view

It has been argued that there are never exact particles or waves, but only some compromise or intermediate between them. One consideration
is that zero-dimensional mathematical points cannot be observed. Another is that the formal representation of such points, the Kronecker delta function is unphysical, because it cannot be normalized. Parallel arguments apply to pure wave states.  Roger Penrose states:
 
 "Such 'position states' are idealized wavefunctions in the opposite sense from the momentum states. Whereas the momentum states are infinitely spread out, the position states are infinitely concentrated. Neither is normalizable ...." 

Relational approach to wave–particle duality

Relational quantum mechanics is developed which regards the detection event as establishing a relationship between the quantized field and the detector. The inherent ambiguity associated with applying Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and thus wave–particle duality is subsequently avoided.quantum-relativity.pdf. See Q. Zheng and T. Kobayashi, Quantum Optics as a Relativistic Theory of Light; Physics Essays 9 (1996) 447. Annual Report, Department of Physics, School of Science, University of Tokyo (1992) 240.

Semantic artifact view

Robert Anton Wilson suggests that many of the so-called quantum paradoxes represent semantic artifacts that disappear when using E-Prime, a variant of English avoiding the use of the verb to be, for reporting observed scientific phenomena.  Wilson frequently used the wave-particle duality example to illustrate his idea. To wit, let us propose one group of scientists performs a set of experiments and reports, "One experiment demonstrates light is a wave while another demonstrates light is a particle." Let us also propose that another group of scientists halfway around the world also perform an identical set of experiments and reports, "When constrained by one experiment, light behaved as a wave and while constrained by another experiment, light behaved as a particle." Although both groups of scientists aim to report similar empirical observations, the first group makes an existential conclusion about the 'is-ness' of light. The second group reports their observations operationally, describing what they actually observed light doing rather than jumping to an existential conclusion about what light 'is'.

Applications

Although it is difficult to draw a line separating wave–particle duality from the rest of quantum mechanics, it is nevertheless possible to list some applications of this basic idea.

DDA and Discontinuous Motion in Quantum Mechanics

Dr. Shan Gao (page location 1785) and the equations of DDA, DEM, wave-particle duality, and quantum mechanics, to explain aspects of the Double-slit experiment in Quantum mechanics and Complementarity. The nontechnical foundation of the idea is to resolve wave vs. particle issues by looking at wave motion of electrons or photons (particles) thorough a discretizing lens—using discontinuous motion ideas and equations to explain how motion can occur in blocks, with the blocks then defined as particles (and/or, "discrete time units"). The analogous equation aspects are widely accepted (as of Adler, 2002, ibid above reference locations), but generalizing them to bi location of particles in the slit experiment is still theoretical and speculative.
