[[File:View from Battle Hill-James Smillie.. Here on Lord Stirling's left flank about 300 Americans under Colonel Atlee and General Parsons repulsed successive attacks by the British after taking the hill, and inflicted the highest casualties against the British during the Battle of Long Island.[ref]The Campaign of 1776 Around New York and Brooklyn
 By Henry Phelps Johnston pp.171-172 [
About 23:00 on August 26, 1776, the first shots of the Battle of Long Island were fired near the Red Lion Inn (near present-day 39th St. and 4th Ave.). American pickets - part of Samuel John Atlee's Pennsylvania regiment - fired upon two British soldiers who were foraging in a watermelon patch near the Red Lion. p.269 (1867)
Around 01:00 on August 27, the British approached the vicinity of the Red Lion with between 200–300 troops. The American troops fired upon the British and after approximately two fusillades fled up the Gowanus Road toward the Vechte-Cortelyou House. Major Edward Burd who had been in command was captured along with a lieutenant and 15 privates. Gallagher: Battle Of Brooklyn 1776 p.33 This first engagement was fought in the vicinity of 38–39 streets between 2nd. and 3rd. avenues near a swamp located adjacent to the Gowanus Road.
Newly promoted Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons a lawyer from Connecticut who had recently secured a commission in the Continental Army, and Colonel Samuel Atlee in command of the First Regiment of Pennsylvania Musketry - a veteran of the French and Indian War - were stationed further north on the Gowanus Road. Putnam had been awakened by a guard at 03:00 and told that the British were attacking through the Gowanus Pass..
Stirling led two units of Colonel John Haslet's, 1st Delaware Regiment under the immediate command of Major Thomas Macdonough, and Colonel William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Infantry under the immediate command of Major Mordecai Gist - both Haslet and Smallwood were on courts-martial duty in Manhattan. Following close behind were Parson's Connecticut regiment with 251 men. Stirling led this combined force to reinforce Parsons and Atlee and stop the British advance. Stirling had a total of 1,600 troops at his command.
Stirling placed Atlee's men in an apple-orchard owned by Wynant Bennett on the southside of the Gowanus Road near present-day 3rd Avenue and 18 Street. Upon the approach of the British:
 We took possession of a hill about two miles from camp, and detached Colonel Atlee to meet them further on the road; in about sixty rods he drew up and received the enemy's fire and gave them a well-directed fire from his regiment, which did great execution, and then retreated to the hill. - General Parsons 
Stirling along with the Delaware and Maryland regiments took up positions just to the north Of Atlee's men on the slopes of a rise of land between 18 and 20 streets. Some of the Maryland troops were positioned on a small hill - called Blokje Berg (Dutch: cube or block hill) by the local Dutch–near 23 Street. At the base of this hill the Gowanus Road crossed a small bridge over a drainage ditch which drained a marshy area. When the British advanced up the Gowanus Road the American troops fired upon them from positions on the north side of the ditch. To the left were Colonel Peter Kachline's Pennsylvania regiment.
Just to the southeast of Blokje Berg were a few hills, amongst them was a hill which is the highest point in King's County at 220 feet which came to be known as Battle Hill–in what is today Greenwood Cemetery by the cemetery's boundary of 23 Street and Seventh Avenue. The British attempted to outflank the American positions by taking this hill. The Americans trying to prevent the British move also sent troops under Parsons and Atlee to take the hill. The British got there first but the Americans were able to dislodge them in fierce fighting.
Battle Hill was the site of especially brutal fighting, with the Americans inflicting the highest number of casualties against the British troops during the entire Battle of Long Island. Among those killed was British Colonel James Grant, which led the Americans to erroneously believe that they had killed General James Grant. He was alleged to have been shot by a Pennsylvanian rifleman who had been sniping at the British from up in a tree. Amongst the American dead was Pennsylvanian Colonel Caleb Parry who was killed while rallying his troops.
In part due to the ferocity of the fighting and the number of British troops engaged, the Americans were still unaware that this was not the main British attack..

Battle Pass

The Hessians, in the center under the command of General von Heister, began to bombard the American lines stationed at Battle Pass under the command of General John Sullivan.. The Hessian brigades, waiting for the pre-arranged signal from the British, who at that time were in the process of outflanking the American lines did not attack. The Americans, still under the assumption that Grant's attack up the Gowanus Road was the main thrust had Sullivan send four hundred of his men to reinforce Stirling.
Howe fired his signal guns at 09:00 and the Hessians began to attack up Battle Pass while the main army came at Sullivan from the rear. Sullivan left his advance guard to hold off the Hessians while he turned the rest of his force around to fight the British. Heavy casualties mounted up between the Americans and the British and men on both sides fled out of fear. Sullivan attempted to calm his men and tried to lead a retreat. By this point the Hessians had overrun the advance guard on the heights and the American left had completely collapsed.. Sullivan, despite the chaos, managed to evacuate most of his men to Brooklyn Heights though Sullivan himself was captured.

The Old Stone House/Vechte-Cortelyou House

At 09:00, Washington arrived from Manhattan..
On the American right, to the west, Stirling still held the line against Grant. Stirling held on for four hours, still unaware of the British flanking maneuver, and some of his own troops thought they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, by 11:00, Grant, reinforced by 2,000 marines, hit Stirling's center and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians. Stirling pulled back but British troops were, at this point, coming at him in his rear south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer' Millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, on the other side of which was Brooklyn Heights..

=Maryland 400=

Stirling ordered all of his troops, except a contingent of Maryland troops under the command of Major Mordecai Gist, to cross the creek. This group of Maryland troops became known to history as the Maryland 400, although they numbered about 260–270 men. Stirling and Gist led the troops in a rear-guard action against the overwhelming numbers of British troops which surpassed 2,000 troops supported by two cannon. Stirling and Gist led the Marylanders in two attacks against the British who were in fixed positions in and in front of the Vechte-Cortelyou House (known today as Old Stone House). After the last assault the remaining troops retreated across the Gowanus Creek. Some of the men who tried to cross the marsh were bogged down in the mud under musket fire and others who could not swim were captured. Stirling was surrounded and, unwilling to surrender to the British, broke through the British lines to von Heister's Hessians and surrendered to them. 256 Maryland troops were killed in the assaults in front of the Old Stone House and fewer then a dozen made it back to the American lines.. Washington, watching from a redoubt on nearby Cobble Hill (intersection of today's Court Street and Atlantic Avenue), was to have said, "Good God, what brave fellows I must this day lose!".[ref]
The 256 dead troops of the Maryland 400 were buried by the British in a mass grave on a hillock on farmer Adrian Van Brunt's land on the outskirts of the marsh. It was from this battle that Maryland gained its nickname "The Old Line State". This mass grave is believed to be around the southwest corner of what is today 3rd Ave. between 7th and 8th Streets.

Disengagement

After those American troops not killed or captured escaped behind the fortified American positions centered on Brooklyn Heights. Howe, in a move considered controversial to this day, ordered all of his troops to halt the attack, despite the protestations of many of the officers in his command who believed that they should push on to Brooklyn Heights. Howe had decided against a direct frontal assault against the entrenched American positions choosing instead to begin a siege and setting up lines of circumvallation around the American positions who he believed to be essentially trapped with his troops blocking escape by land and the Royal Navy in control of the East River which they would have to cross to reach Manhattan Island.
Howe's failure to press the attack, and the reasons for it, have been disputed. He may have wished to avoid the casualties his army suffered when attacking the Continentals under similar circumstances at the Battle of Bunker Hill. p 5.

Aftermath

Retreat to Manhattan

Washington and the army were surrounded on Brooklyn Heights with the East River to their backs..
As the rain continued Washington sent a letter instructing General William Heath, who was at Kings Bridge between Manhattan and what is now the Bronx, to send every flat bottomed boat or sloop without delay in case battalions of infantry from New Jersey might come to reinforce their position..
The troops were told that they were to gather up all their ammunition and baggage and prepare for a night attack. By 21:00, the sick and wounded began to move to the Brooklyn Ferry in preparation for being evacuated. At 23:00, Glover and his Massachusetts troops, who were sailors and fishermen, began to evacuate the troops..
As more troops were evacuated, more troops were ordered to withdraw from the lines and march to the ferry landing. Wagon wheels were muffled, and men were forbidden to talk. Mifflin's rear guard was tending campfires to deceive the British and convince them that nothing was going on. At 04:00, on August 30, Mifflin was informed that it was his unit's turn to evacuate.. Washington exclaimed "Good God! General Mifflin, I am afraid you have ruined us!" Mifflin explained that he had been told that it was his turn to evacuate by Scammell; Washington told him it had been a mistake. Mifflin then led his troops back to the outer defenses.
Artillery, supplies, and troops were all being evacuated across the river at this time but it was not going as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came. A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there did not seem to be any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan.. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated without a single life lost.

Conclusion of the Campaign

The British were stunned to find that Washington and the army had escaped. The next day, August 30, the British troops occupied the American fortifications. When news of the battle reached London, it caused many festivities to take place..
Washington's defeat revealed his deficiencies as a strategist who split his forces, his inexperienced generals who misunderstood the situation, and his raw troops that fled in disorder at the first shots. 1, No. 4 (Jul. 1896), pp. 650-670 in JSTOR On the other hand his daring nighttime retreat has been seen by some historians as one of his greatest military feats. ISBN 978-0-7432-2671-4 Other historians concentrate on the failure of British naval forces to prevent the withdrawal. Calderhead, "British Naval Failure at Long Island: A Lost Opportunity in the American Revolution," New York History, July 1976, Vol. 57 Issue 3, pp 321-338
General Howe remained inactive for the next half month, not attacking until September 15 when he landed a force at Kip's Bay..

Casualties

At the time, it was by far the largest battle ever fought in North America. If the Royal Navy is included, over 40,000 men took part in the battle. Howe reported his losses as 59 killed, 268 wounded and 31 missing. The Hessian casualties were 5 killed and 26 wounded.

Legacy

The most significant legacy of the Battle of Long Island was that it showed there would be no easy victory, and that the war would be long and bloody.
