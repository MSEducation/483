There are 99 counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. The first two counties, Des Moines County and Dubuque County, were created in 1834 when Iowa was still part of the Michigan Territory. In preparation for Michigan's statehood, part of Michigan Territory was formed into Wisconsin Territory in 1836.
The Iowa Constitution of 1857, which is still in effect today, states that counties must have an area of at least  Polk County contains the state's capital and largest city, Des Moines. In addition Iowa has one of the fewest number of counties whose boundaries are dictated by natural means, the vast majority of which being formed by lines of survey instead, resulting in a large number of "box counties".
