Gösta Ingvar Carlsson (born 9 November 1934) is a Swedish politician who twice served as Prime Minister of Sweden, first from 1986 to 1991 and again from 1994 to 1996.
Carlsson was a member of the Riksdag from 1965 to 1996 representing the constituency of Stockholm County (until 1970 in the Lower House). He served as Minister of Education from 1969 to 1973, as Minister of Housing in 1973 and again from 1974 to 1976 and as Minister of Environmental affairs from 1985 to 1986. He served as Deputy Prime Minister from 1982 to 1986 and assumed office as Prime Minister of Sweden upon the assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986.

Early life

Carlsson was born in Borås, Västra Götaland County (then Älvsborg County), Sweden. Carlsson has a diploma in business economics and a degree in political science from Lund University. In Lund he met with Tage Erlander, the Swedish prime minister and his aide Olof Palme, later to become Erlander's successor.
Ingvar Carlsson is the son of Olof Karlsson and Ida, née Johansson. He is married since 1957 to librarian Ingrid Carlsson, born Melander in 1934, with whom he has two daughters.

Political career

After finishing studies Carlsson got a job in Erlander's staff. In 1965, after completing further studies at Northwestern University in Illinois in the United States, he was elected member of the Swedish Parliament. In the same year, he also became leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League. He had the following ministerial posts: Minister of Education 1969-1973, Minister of Housing 1973-1976, Deputy Prime Minister 1982-1986.
He was, together with Olof Palme, known as one of "Erlander's boys."

Prime Minister

Following the assassination of Olof Palme in 1986 Ingvar Carlsson became the new Prime Minister or Statsminister and party leader. Together with Minister for Finance Kjell-Olof Feldt, the government turned a budget deficit of 90 billions SEK to a surplus of a few hundred billion SEK, which led to large investments and record low unemployment.  As Prime Minister he also carried out a comprehensive reform of the tax system. But Sweden's economy would start deteriorate more in the early 1990s. In 1990 the Carlsson cabinet resigned after failing to gain majority for economic reforms, but was reinstated immediately with a slightly changed agenda.
The Social Democrats lost the elections in 1991, but Carlsson returned to power after the elections in 1994.
After three years of a liberal government and an election victory in 1994 elections, Carlsson could re-form a government. This government put focus on cleaning up the Swedish Government finances, and it was assigned to the newly appointed Minister of Finance Göran Persson. The government period was tough and it was strongly criticized by trade unions and party members for all cut-backs and tax increases that were made. 
In August 1995, Ingvar Carlsson announced that he would resign as party leader and Swedish Prime Minister. His successor was long considered to be the then Minister of Equality and Deputy Prime Minister Mona Sahlin. However, due to the so-called Toblerone Affair, she took back her candidacy and also later resigned from the government. On December 5, 1995, the nomination committee proposed Minister for Finance Göran Persson as the new party leader candidate. He was elected on March 15, the following year on the Social Democratic Party Congress to the Social Democratic party leader and on March 22, 1996 he was elected Prime Minister.

Later life

Ingvar Carlsson was Chairman of the inquiry after the Gothenburg Riots of 2001 to investigate the events. Their report was submitted to the Government on January 14, 2003.
Ingvar Carlsson is head of the United Nations independent Rwanda-commission. He is also chairman of the Bergman Foundation Center on Fåro. 
With Shridath Ramphal, he was in 1995 one of the co-chairs of the Commission on Global Governance, which reported on issues of international development, international security, globalization and global governance.
His career has been shaped by the heritage of Olof Palme, with whom he worked closely, but his policies are more seen as being a continuation of the legacy established by Tage Erlander.
Ingvar Carlsson is a big supporter of football teams IF Elfsborg and Wolverhampton Wanderers.
