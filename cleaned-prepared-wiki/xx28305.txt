BioWare is a Canadian video game developer founded in February 1995 by newly graduated medical doctors Ray Muzyka, Greg Zeschuk, and Augustine Yip. BioWare is currently owned by American company Electronic Arts. The company specializes in role-playing video games, and became famous for launching highly praised and successful licensed franchises, Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. They proceeded to make several other successful games based on original IP: Jade Empire, the Mass Effect series, and the Dragon Age series. In 2011, BioWare launched their first MMORPG, Star Wars: The Old Republic.

History

BioWare was established in February 1995 by Ray Muzyka, Greg Zeschuk, Trent Oster, Brent Oster, Marcel Zeschuk, and Augustine Yip. The three doctors (Muzyka, Zeschuk, Yip) had recently graduated together from medical school at the University of Alberta; Their success in the medical field provided them with the funding they needed to launch a video game company. To make their first game, they pooled their resources which resulted in capital of $100,000.
Their first game, Shattered Steel, began its life as a proof-of-concept demo, similar to the MechWarrior games. This demo was submitted to ten publishers, seven of whom returned to the company with an offer. A publishing deal for Shattered Steel was eventually signed with Interplay Entertainment. Brent Oster and Trent Oster left BioWare at that time to form Pyrotek Studios, which continued developing Shattered Steel but broke up a year later, with Oster returning to BioWare to finish the game. BioWare's first game was released the following year. Shattered Steel's release was described by IGN as a "modest success" with "decent sales". Two noteworthy points were the deformable terrain (player weapon damage caused craters in the environment) and zone damage (well-placed gunfire could shoot mounted weapons off enemies). A sequel to Shattered Steel was planned for 1998 but never realized.
BioWare's founders and staff were keenly interested in both computerized and pen-and-paper variants of role-playing games. When Interplay financed "exploratory development", BioWare presented the publishers with a demo called Battleground: Infinity. Interplay suggested that the demonstrated gameplay engine would be well-suited to the Dungeons & Dragons license which it had acquired from SSI. Accordingly, Infinity was reworked in line with the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset.
This resulted in Baldur's Gate, which witnessed a development cycle of three years. During this time, the three doctors continued to practice medicine. However, in the final years of the project, the demands of development prompted Muzyka and Zeschuck to leave medicine and move into full-time development. Augustine Yip decided to continue with his medical practice. Baldur's Gate sold more than two million copies after its release, nearly matching the sales of Diablo. Following the success of Baldur's Gate, the Infinity Engine was used for the games Planescape: Torment and the Icewind Dale series. The success of Baldur's Gate was followed by an expansion pack for the game: Tales of the Sword Coast.
At this point, BioWare decided to return to the action genre. The company's initial thought was to develop a sequel to Shattered Steel, but eventually a sequel to MDK from Shiny Entertainment was chosen for development. MDK 2 was released on PC, Dreamcast, and eventually PlayStation 2, offering BioWare their first taste of developing games for consoles. MDK 2 drew the same level of praise as its predecessor but, despite the success, BioWare returned to the Baldur's Gate series for their next project.
Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn was released in 2000, two years after the release of Baldur's Gate. Baldur's Gate II sold two million copies, matching the sales of the first game in the series. However, the success of both Baldur's Gate II and MDK 2 were not enough to stabilize Interplay financially. The company experienced multiple failures, which eventually led to bankruptcy. Following Interplay's bankruptcy, BioWare began to work with Infogrames, which was later renamed to Atari. Neverwinter Nights was originally to be published by Interplay, but the company lost the license of the game to Atari and part of their Dungeons & Dragons license, to BioWare. After selling their D&D license to Atari, BioWare developed Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire. It had publishing relationships with Interplay Entertainment, Infogrames/Atari, LucasArts, and Microsoft.
The next few years saw a number of changes in BioWare's corporate status. In November 2005, it was announced that BioWare and Pandemic Studios (itself founded by former Activision employees) would be joining forces, with private equity fund Elevation Partners investing in the partnership. On October 11, 2007, however, it was announced that this new partnership (organized as VG Holding Corp) had been bought by Electronic Arts. BioWare therefore became a unit of EA, but retained its own branding.
In 2007, BioWare released the science fiction RPG Mass Effect. The following year, BioWare released Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood on the Nintendo DS, its first title for a handheld game console.  Near the end of 2009, BioWare released the fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Origins, and in January 2010, Mass Effect 2. Later, EA announced that BioWare would be merged with Mythic Entertainment, another division of EA, so that they could have all of their RPG development in one business unit.
BioWare completed three major games between 2011 and 2012. The MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic is based on BioWare's previous contribution to the Star Wars franchise,
The growth of the RPG/MMO Group as part of Electronic Arts in 2008+ has resulted in three additional studios being added to the BioWare Group outside BioWare's original home base in Edmonton. The first, located in Austin, Texas and headed by industry veterans Gordon Walton and Richard Vogel, was created to work on the Star Wars: The Old Republic MMORPG project. Both the studio and the project were announced on March 13, 2006. On March 2, 2009, BioWare announced it had opened a new studio in Montreal, Quebec to assist with existing projects as necessary. In 2009 Mythic Entertainment, based in Fairfax, Virginia, became part of the RPG/MMO Group, later being renamed BioWare Mythic in early 2010.
On June 24, 2009, Electronic Arts announced a restructuring of their RPG and MMO games development into a new group that included both Mythic Entertainment and BioWare. Ray Muzyka, co-founder and General Manager of BioWare was appointed the Group General Manager of this newly formed "BioWare Group". BioWare's other co-founder, Greg Zeschuk, became the Group Creative Officer for the new RPG/MMO studio group. Rob Denton stepped up as General Manager of Mythic, reporting to Muzyka, and later became the Group Operations Officer of the new group. BioWare's studios remained unchanged and continued to report to Muzyka.
The company announced that it would be opening up a new customer service office in Galway, Ireland, in 2011.
The company was also a starting place for other Albertan game developers, such as being the former employer of the HermitWorks Entertainment staff.
Following the release of Mass Effect 3 in March 2012, numerous players complained about its endings failing to fulfill the developer's earlier promises regarding the conclusion of the trilogy. In response to these criticisms, BioWare announced on April 5 that they would reschedule their post-release content production and release an "Extended Cut" DLC that would expand the original endings and address the most common points of critique.
On September 18, 2012, the next day after the official announcement of the third Dragon Age title, both Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, two of the remaining co-founders of BioWare, simultaneously announced they will be retiring from the gaming industry.

Structure

After the retirement of the two remaining BioWare co-founders, Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, Matthew Bromberg is the current group general manager of the BioWare label. The BioWare group consists of following studios:
Former members of the BioWare group include:

Games

Following games have been developed by BioWare Edmonton ("BioWare" before 2006), BioWare Montreal, and BioWare Austin.

Game engines

Between 1998 and 2011, BioWare developed a number of in-house video game engines to serve as technical basis for their games. Some of these engines were then licensed to other companies to develop their own games. Others came with modding toolkits, allowing the fan community to implement original adventures using the technology of BioWare's games.

Infinity Engine

BioWare created the Infinity Engine to use it as a core component for development of 2D role-playing video games based on Dungeons & Dragons, the Baldur's Gate series (1998–2001). The engine was also used by Black Isle Studios to create the critically acclaimed Planescape: Torment (1999) and the Icewind Dale series (2000–2002).

Aurora Engine

The Aurora Engine was the successor to the Infinity Engine, featuring full 3D environments, real-time lighting and shadows, and surround sound.
Obsidian Entertainment (successor to Black Isle Studios) used an updated version of BioWare's Aurora, titled "Electron Engine", to produce Neverwinter Nights 2 (2006) and its three expansion packs (2007–2009). Like the original, the Electron toolset was released with the game.
The Polish studio CD Projekt RED used the Aurora Engine to develop The Witcher, the 2007 video game adaptation of the eponymous Polish fantasy novel series, although the rendering module was rewritten from scratch.

Odyssey Engine

BioWare used an updated version of the Aurora, titled the Odyssey Engine, to produce the critically acclaimed Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic in 2003 and their first original IP RPG Jade Empire in 2005. Odyssey Engine was the first BioWare engine to allow developing for video game consoles, with both KotOR and JE originally released for the Xbox before being ported to the PC platform.
Obsidian Entertainment used the Odyssey Engine to develop Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords (2004), a sequel to the original KotOR. BioWare maintained limited oversight on Obsidian's development of The Sith Lords, as well as  Neverwinter Nights 2.

Eclipse Engine

The Eclipse Engine succeeded the Odyssey Engine and, among other things, supported PhysX hardware acceleration.
A heavily upgraded version of the Eclipse Engine, internally known as the "Lycium Engine", was used to produce Dragon Age II (2011).

Other developments

BioWare licensed Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3 to develop the original Mass Effect trilogy (2007–2012), and Simutronics' HeroEngine for Star Wars: The Old Republic (2011), the successor to the KotOR series.
Both Dragon Age: Inquisition and the next Mass Effect installment have been announced to be based on EA DICE's Frostbite 3 engine, as part of the general move towards a unified technology foundation across all of Electronic Arts' developer studios.

Controversies

Mass Effect sex claims

In January 2008,  neoconservative blogger Kevin McCullough wrote an article claiming that BioWare's Mass Effect contained full-frontal nudity and graphic sodomy.

Mass Effect 3 ending

In March 2012, BioWare released Mass Effect 3, the final chapter of its initial Mass Effect trilogy. Leading up to its release, the developer's web site announced that "the decisions you make completely shape your experience and outcome". However, many players On June 26, 2012, BioWare released a free DLC titled Extended Cut, which expanded the original endings to correct some of the concerns the players had felt since the release.

Awards and recognition

In addition to numerous game awards, the company has been awarded with a number of business related awards:
