CATEGORIES: Coal mines, Mines in Belgium

The Coal mine of Hasard de Cheratte (or Cheratte 10) is the main colliery of Société anonyme des Charbonnages du Hasard composed of four mine shafts. It is located in Cheratte, a section of the Belgian town of Visé located in the Walloon Region in the province of Liège. The first well was dug in 1850 to extract dice coal and closed for the first time in 1877 following an accident. It re-opened thirty years later in 1907 and operated until 1977. In the early twenty-first century, the mine is now known as an urban ruin. Remediation of the site and the demolition of several buildings are planned between 2014 and 2015.

History

This first shaft was dug in 1850. Its depth is 250 meters. It's work is to bring back the tailings to the surface.
A third mine and a headframe were built between 1927 and 1947. In 1938, the mine has reach 313 metres depth, but it only begun to work in 1953. Il is improved and reached 480 metres depth. The exctraction machine at its top is insufficient. The engineer decide to install a machine on the floor, and to improve it. The mine n° 1 stopped the extraction and became a rescue mine. Then, its additional building are converted to showers and cloakrooms. The mine n° 2 is sealt off. In the 1930s, the site reach its apogee and employed 1 500 openers. When it has been closed on October 31, 1977, it employed more than 600 miners.

Architecture

The coal mines have got varied industrial architectures, because several building were built during the same period, but with different styles. Each tower has got its own style. The towers and the additional buildings of mine n° 1 are built with medieval architecture, whereas the mine number two had a metallic tower. The tower of the mine n° 3 is the tallest of the site, and is built with reinforced concrete. It was first built to host a machine at its top, but this machine have finally been built on the ground. The tower of Belle-Fleur mine has been built on the same principle, but is taller and has got a typical architecture of the 1920s.

In 2007, the Hasard is included in a rehabilitation program made by Wallon GovernmentPatrimoine classé, 62108-CLT-0013  to restore frontages and roofs of the Phalanstère, and also the machines room and the wooded hill. The tower of mine n° 1 is classified to local heritage since 1980.
At the end of the year 2008 Mr. Lowie filed a building permit for the demolition of the tower concrete Well No. 3 and ancillary buildings to replace them with housing and shops, but the opposition is strong and the project is suspended. The  30 April 2013, after more than thirty years of controversy between the owners and the authorities, notice of expropriation is recorded by the Minister Philip Henry and the site of the coal becomes public.rapide à Cheratte
