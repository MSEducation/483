[[Israeli Football League]]

CATEGORIES: American football in Israel, American football leagues, Sports leagues in Israel, Sports leagues established in 2005

The Israel Football League was founded in the summer of 2005 by a group of Israelis, led by Ofri Becker, who wanted to play tackle American football.  The first season, played without pads or an official governing body, began in the Fall of 2005.  In 2007, the league began fully equipped play under the umbrella of American Football in Israel (AFI), and Israel Bowl I was held in 2008.
The IFL is sponsored by New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and his family.

Season history

2007–08 season

The inaugural season of the IFL, with regulation pads and staff, witnessed a surprisingly high level of play for a first-year tackle league.  There were four teams in the league for the 2007–08 season: the Big Blue Jerusalem Lions, the Real Housing Haifa Underdogs, the Dancing Camel Hasharon Pioneers, and the Mike's Place Tel Aviv Sabres. In the championship game, Israel Bowl I, the Big Blue Jerusalem Lions defeated the Real Housing Haifa Underdogs in overtime.

The league grew to five teams with the addition of another team in Jerusalem (The Blue Sun Music Kings), while the Dancing Camel Pioneers moved to a new home in Modi'in.  The Pioneers defeated the defending champion Lions, 32–26, after two overtimes, in Israel Bowl II.

2009–10 season

After growing from four to five teams the previous year, the IFL expanded to seven teams for the 2009–10 season with the addition of two new teams, the Beer Sheva Black Swarm and the Judean Rebels.  The schedule grew, as well, as each team was scheduled to play 10 regular season games followed by playoffs.  The teams who finished the regular season in first through sixth place qualified for the playoffs. The Tel Aviv Sabres defeated the Jerusalem Lions in Israel Bowl III.

2010–11 season

With eight teams in the I.F.L., the league was split into two divisions: the North Division, consisting of the Tel Aviv/Jaffa Sabres, the newly relocated Tel Aviv Pioneers, the Haifa Underdogs, and the expansion Herzliya Hammers; and the South Division, consisting of the Jerusalem Lions, the Jerusalem Kings, the Judean Rebels, and the Be'er Sheva Black Swarm. Each team played a home-and-away series against each of its division rivals and one game against each team in the other division for a total of ten regular season games. The top team in each division got an automatic bye into the semi-finals, with the number two seed in each division hosting the number three seed in a "wild-card" game, and the last team in each division missing the playoffs.
In the North Division, the Sabres clinched the bye and in the semis beat the Pioneers, who had beaten the Hammers in the first round.
In the South division, the Rebels beat the Black Swarm in the first round and then beat the Lions in the semis in an unforgettable comeback, coming back from an 18-point deficit with 7:40 to go in the game. Rebels QB and League M.V.P. Alex Swieca took the winning score in himself with just sixteen seconds left.
The Rebels defeated the Sabres in Israel Bowl IV by a score of 32–30, having almost let the Sabres complete a comeback of their own.

2011–12 season

Two additional teams joined the league: The Petah Tikva Troopers joined the South Division and the Northern Stars joined the North Division. Media coverage grew as the league gained popularity throughout the country. The Tel Aviv Pioneers defeated the Jerusalem Kings in the wild-card round, and proceeded to rout the previously undefeated Jerusalem Lions behind a record-setting performance by running back Ilan Bielas.
Israel Bowl V was a Tel Aviv derby. The Sabres took a 14-0 lead in the 1st quarter, but had no answer to Pioneers RB Ilan Bielas, who lead his team to a 28-22 lead in the 2nd quarter, and the half ended with a tie game. The 3rd quarter was a scoreless affair, setting the table for a back-and-forth 4th quarter with the teams alternating scores, and setting up a final Pioneer drive with 1 minute remaining and the Sabres ahead by 2. An unfortunate miscommunication between QB Itay Ashkenazi and RB Koby Nimrod lead to a Pioneer fumble, which the Sabres pounced on to clinch their 2nd crown.

2012-13 season

The league expanded to 11 teams as the Rehovot Silverbacks became the newest expansion franchise. The division format was left behind in favor of a simple schedule in which every team played every other team once. The Tel Aviv/Jaffa Sabres became the first team in IFL history to go undefeated throughout the regular season and post-season, as they loaded up on talent and barreled their way through the schedule. The wild card round saw both underdog teams come out victorious, including the Kings' Hail Mary pass to beat the Hammers. In the semifinals, the Sabres crushed the Kings and the Rebels upset the Pioneers in 100+ degree heat. The Sabres and Rebels went toe-to-toe in Israel Bowl VI, but the Sabres pulled away midway through the third quarter, and held on for their second straight title.
