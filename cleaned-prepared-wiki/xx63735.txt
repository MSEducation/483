Cru, known as Campus Crusade for Christ around the world, is an interdenominational Christian organization that promotes evangelism and discipleship in more than 190 countries
around the world. In 1996, USA Today called Cru the largest evangelical organization in the United States. Today, the organization employs over 25,000 full-time missionaries and has trained 225,000 volunteers around the world.American Executive, July 2008
Founded in 1951 at the University of California, Los Angeles by Bill Bright as a ministry for college students, Cru has since expanded its focus to include adult professionals, families, and more. The World Headquarters is located in Orlando, Florida, and the current president of the organization is Steve Douglass.
Cru is also the publisher of The Four Spiritual Laws, also known as the "Knowing God Personally" booklet. This takes non-believers through the four steps of Christianity and sums up the Gospel in just a few short pages. It provides an overview to those who do not want to feel pressured by someone lecturing them. It's also an easier read for someone who finds the Bible intimidating.
On July 19, 2011, it was announced that Campus Crusade for Christ in the United States will be changing their name to Cru in order to overcome existing barriers and perceptions inherent in the original name. This name was already in use on a number of college campuses.Press Release

The Jesus Film Project

The Jesus Film Project was founded in 1981 to translate the Hollywood film Jesus into other languages so that it could be shown by missionaries to peoples around the world in their native languages.Jesus Film Project Fact Sheet
The first translation was done for the Tagalog-speaking people of the Philippines. In 2004, the organization made the film available for viewing on its website in over 800 languages.  Audio dramatizations in a number of languages are also available.
The origins of The Jesus Film Project date back to 1945 when a young businessman named Bill Bright wanted to privately finance a film about the life of Jesus ChristCome Help Change the World, by Bill Bright, page 143 that was entertaining, biblically accurate, and which could be translated into non-English languages. Rather than making a film at that time, Bright went on to found a Christian ministry to reach college students called Campus Crusade for Christ in 1951.
In 1976, with Cru's influence spreading beyond college campuses to sports, the marketplace and other aspects of society, Bright turned his attention once again to filmmaking. Hollywood producer John Heyman approached Bright to fund a project to put the entire Bible on film. The project would eventually be scaled back to just one book of the Bible, the Gospel of Luke, and be financed primarily by Campus Crusade supporters Bunker and Caroline HuntCome Help Change the World, by Bill Bright, pages 144â€“145 for a sum of US$6 million.
A team of 500 scholars and leaders from secular and Christian organizations began to research historical elements for a film about Jesus. Filming took place over the course of several months throughout the Middle East.The Jesus Film Project History of the Film
Jesus was produced by John Heyman, a German-born Jew and starred British Shakespearean actor Brian Deacon as Jesus, Rivka Neumann as Mary, Yosef Shiloach as Joseph and Niko Nitai as Peter.Internet Movie Database
The Jesus Film Project has translated Jesus into 1,006 languages and shown the film in 228 nations.

Demand for the seminars spread to community leaders and pastors so they opened the seminars to the public in 1978. Since 1976 more than 1.5 million people have attended conferences. Today, approximately 100 "Weekend to Remember" conferences are held annually in almost every major city in America.

Josh McDowell

In 1964, Josh McDowell became a traveling representative of Cru addressing campus groups about the Christian faith. Over the years his ministry has focused on Christian apologetics, youth issues such as relationships and sexuality, and international humanitarian aid.
McDowell's writings have concentrated on addressing challenges to belief, questions posed by non-Christians, doubts about faith, and non-Christian religions. Notable works include Evidence That Demands A Verdict, The Resurrection Factor, He Walked Among Us, More Than A Carpenter and The Da Vinci Code: A Quest for Answers. McDowell has arranged his arguments by pleading for a cumulative case of evidences, such as archaeological discoveries, the extant manuscripts of the biblical texts, fulfilled prophecies, and the miracle of the resurrection.

Fundraising

Staff members

Cru staff members raise funds for the organization to pay their salaries and ministry expenses. All staff have the same base pay adjusted by tenure, life situation (single, married, children), and geographic cost of living.campuscrusadeforchrist.
Married staff members are considered a missionary team. In practice this means that if single staff members marry, their new spouse must join staff also if they are not on staff already, otherwise the existing staff member must resign. If a prospective member is engaged or plans to marry in the first year, their fiance must apply as well.ccci.htm CCCI.org staff qualifications
Cru does not invite single parents to join, as they feel the demands of the mission would take away from the single parent's ability to raise their child.

Around the world

In many parts of Europe, Cru is known as Agape Europeagapeeurope. In Israel Cru was known as ONE FOR ISRAEL until July 2013. The collegiate ministry is known in some parts of the world as Student Life (Poland, New Zealand, Australia and United Kingdom); Power to Change (Canada); Lembaga Pelayanan Mahasiswa Indonesia (LPMI) In Indonesia; or LIFE Ministry (southeast Africa). In English-Speaking West Africa, the organization is known as Great Commission Movement. The changing of the name of the U.S.-based ministry to Cru will not affect the names of overseas ministries.
