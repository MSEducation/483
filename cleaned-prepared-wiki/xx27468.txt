StarOffice, known briefly as Oracle Open Office before being discontinued in 2011, was a proprietary office suite. It originated in 1985 as StarWriter by StarDivision, which was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 1999. Sun was itself acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010.
StarOffice supports the OpenOffice. It includes templates, a macro recorder, and a software development kit (SDK).
The source code of the suite was released in July 2000, creating a free, open source office suite called OpenOffice.
In March 2009, a study showed that StarOffice only had a 3% market share in the corporate market.
In April 2011, Oracle announced the discontinuation of Oracle Open Office

History

StarWriter 1.0 was written by Marco Borries in 1985 for the Zilog Z80. Borries formed StarDivision in Lüneburg the following year. which was later ported to the 8086-based Amstrad PC-1512, running under MS-DOS 3.2. Later, the integration of the other individual programs followed as the development progressed to an Office Suite for DOS, IBM's OS/2 Warp, and for the Microsoft Windows operating-system. From this time onwards StarDivision marketed its suite under the name "StarOffice."
Until version 4.2, StarDivision based StarOffice on the cross-platform C++ class library StarView. In 1998 StarDivision began offering StarOffice for free.
Sun Microsystems acquired the company, copyright and trademark of StarOffice in 1999 for .5 million for Star Division, C|Net Sun wanted to compete with Microsoft Office, and also wanted to save money on licenses for Microsoft Office and Windows:

Naming

StarSuite, the version of StarOffice with Asian language localization, included Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese interfaces. It also included additional fonts for the East Asian market, resulting in slightly larger installation footprint. Otherwise the features were identical to StarOffice.
The two brands existed because a StarOffice brand was owned by another company in certain Asian countries.

Sun ONE Webtop

In 2001 Sun Microsystems announced Sun ONE Webtop - formerly known as project StarPortal - a limited release. It is based on StarOffice components.[ref]
