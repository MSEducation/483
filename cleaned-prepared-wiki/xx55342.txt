Metrolink Also referred to as Manchester Metrolink, 25 million passenger journeys were made on the system in 2012/13.
A light rail system for Greater Manchester was born of Greater Manchester County Council's obligations to provide "an integrated and efficient system of public transport" under its structure plan and the Transport Act 1968.
Metrolink has 77 stops along  Other changes include a yellow and silver branding and livery, which replaced the system's original grey and aquamarine identity in 2008.
Expansion of Metrolink has been a key strategy of transport planners in Greater Manchester, who have overseen its development in successive projects, known as Phases 1, 2, 3a, 3b and 2CC, which, upon completion of Phases 3b and 2CC in 2016/17, will make Metrolink the largest light rail network in the United Kingdom, with  of track and 93 stops, handling an estimated 45 million passenger journeys a year. TfGM have endorsed further expansion with proposals for new lines to Stockport and Port Salford, and the addition of tram-train technology.

History

Origins

A light rail system for Greater Manchester was born of a desire by the Greater Manchester County Council to fulfil its obligations to provide "an integrated and efficient system of public transport" under its structure plan and the Transport Act 1968.
In 1982, the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE; the successor to SELNEC PTE) concluded that an overground metropolitan light rail system to replace or complement the region's under-used heavy railways was the most economical solution to improving Greater Manchester's public transport network, which suffered from poor integration and outdated infrastructure;

Phase 1

Conversion of the East Lancashire Railway (Bury-to-Victoria) and Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (Altrincham-to-Piccadilly) heavy rail lines, and creation of a street-level tramway
On 27 September 1989, following a two-stage tender exercise, the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority awarded a contract to the GMA Group (a consortium composed of AMEC, GM Buses, John Mowlem and Company, and a General Electric Company plc subsidiary)
The Bury line was closed in stages between 13 July 1991 and 17 August 1991, after which the 1200V DC third rail electrified line was adapted for a 750V DC overhead line operation.
Initially projected to open in September 1991, then promised for 21 February 1992,
Then costing £145 million (£

Phase 2

Extension of the Metrolink network was intended to be continuous with successive expansion phases delivered in strict order of priority.
During the 1990s, Salford Quays became a business district specifically redeveloped for commerce, leisure, culture and tourism with a high density of business units and modern housing, complemented by a cinema complex, office blocks, and waterfront promenade. As it had poor public transport integration and no rail provision, it was earmarked for a potential Metrolink line as early as 1986 and legal authority to construct the line through the Quays was acquired in 1990.
The Eccles Line was officially opened as far as Broadway Metrolink station on 6 December 1999 by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who praised Metrolink as "exactly the type of scheme needed to solve the transport problems of the metropolitan areas of the country"; Patronage increased during the 2000s as the Eccles Line steadily increased in popularity in keeping with a rise in passenger numbers across the whole Metrolink system and was beginning to become overcrowded by the end of the decade.

Phase 3

In 2000, officials and transport planners in Greater Manchester considered Metrolink to be a "phenomenal success".
Conceding that it would be "very difficult" to bring Metrolink to the City of Manchester Stadium by 2002, the Government accepted its importance to Greater Manchester and the Commonwealth Games on 22 March 2000, with an announcement from Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott that a £289,000,000 government contribution to fund Phase 3 would make Metrolink "the envy of Europe".
In response, highlighting the legal costs and demolition of homes, schools and offices in anticipation of the new lines, the Get Our Metrolink Back on Track (or Back on Track ) campaign spearheaded by the Manchester Evening News and Members of Parliament from Greater Manchester was organised to lobby the Department for Transport to fund Phase 3.

=Phase 3a=

Phase 3a, dubbed the "Mini Bang", or "Little Bang", was an extension scheme approved by the government on 6 July 2006, with final sign off and release of Treasury funds in May 2008. In addition to the separately NWRDA-funded spur from the Eccles Line to MediaCityUK, Phase 3a involved converting the  The Oldham and Rochdale and South Manchester lines were funded by a £244,000,000 lump sum from the government. The East Manchester Line to Droylsden was funded by borrowings by GMPTE that would be repaid over 30 years using fare revenue from Metrolink.
The Oldham Loop Line, subsidised by GMPTE and used for suburban commuting, closed on 3 October 2009 allowing work to convert the line from heavy rail to Metrolink,
The planned opening of Phase 3a services was initially delayed on each line by months due to faults with a new £22,000,000 digital signalling and control system known as the Tram Management System, or TMS, designed by the Thales Group.

=Phase 3b=

Phase 3b was revealed in July 2006 when Phase 3 was split into two smaller phases.
Tasked with procuring funds for Phase 3b from sources other than central Government, in July 2007 GMPTE and AGMA submitted a bid to the Transport Innovation Fund, which would release a multi-million pound sum for public transport improvements linked to viable anti-road traffic congestion strategies. Metrolink system once Phase 3b is completed in 2016.

Phase 2CC

The Second City Crossing (also known as 2CC) Construction is to commence in 2014, with Exchange Square Metrolink station joining the network as a new stop on the crossing; a Shaw and Crompton-to-Exchange Square service is to join the network in 2015 with completion of the scheme expected in 2016/17.

Operator

Metrolink is run as a public-private partnership between TfGM and private transport firms. Metrolink RATP Dev, a part of the French state-owned RATP Group which operates the Paris Métro, bought the Metrolink contract from Stagecoach on 1 August 2011.
Metrolink is headed by Peter Cushing, the Metrolink Director at TfGM.

Branding and public relations

The name Metrolink and a system-wide aquamarine, black and grey corporate branding and vehicle livery was devised by Fitch RS and Design Triangle,
Metrolink has been a "Football Development Partner" with the Manchester Football Association since August 2010,
Transport planners in Greater Manchester describe Metrolink as both "an icon of Greater Manchester",
In 2013, Manchester City F.C. manager Roberto Mancini and players Joe Hart, Vincent Kompany and James Milner recorded special stop announcements to be used on Metrolink's East Manchester Line on dates when Manchester City play at home at the City of Manchester Stadium (served by the Etihad Campus Metrolink station). The announcements were first used on 17 February 2013, for Manchester City's Fifth Round Proper tie against Leeds United A.F.C. in the 2012–13 FA Cup.

Infrastructure

Stations and lines

As of April 2014, Metrolink has a network length of  Between 1992 and 2007, electricity for the Metrolink system was procured by the operator, based on price only. In 2007, GMPTE changed the contractual requirements to ensure that sustainable power would be factored into choosing an energy supplier, and in July 2007, Metrolink became the first  light rail network in the UK with electricity supplied entirely from sustainable energy via hydropower.

Rolling stock

For passenger services, Metrolink uses a fleet of specially designed articulated vehicles exclusively composed of Bombardier Flexity Swift M5000s, first introduced in 2009. These were preceded by Ansaldo Firema T-68/T-68As,
The T-68s were Metrolink's original passenger fleet. They were in passenger service from the opening of Metrolink in 1992, and were phased out between April 2012 and February 2014. 
In 1999, Metrolink's passenger fleet was bolstered by six new vehicles to run on the Eccles Line. Numbered 2001 through to 2006, these T-68A vehicles were based on the original T-68s, but had modifications replacing destination rollblinds with dot matrix displays, and retractable couplers and covered bogies necessary for the high proportion of on-street running close to motor traffic. Three of the earlier T-68 fleet were similarly equipped, and were known as T-68Ms. The T-68As were retired on 30 April 2014.
Built by Bombardier Transportation and Vossloh Kiepe, and costing £2,000,000 each, the M5000 vehicles were introduced to Metrolink in December 2009, driven by increased passenger demand. They are part of the Flexity Swift range of light rail vehicles, and have a design similar to the K5000 vehicle used on the Cologne Stadtbahn, This replacement plan would provide Metrolink with a uniform fleet by 2014. In October 2013, the authority agreed to procure a further ten M5000s in 2014 to facilitate the construction of the proposed Trafford Park line, while in the interim supporting a service between MediaCityUK and Manchester city centre. A press release from Bombardier, dated 20 December 2013, stated that Metrolink had ordered a further ten vehicles. The M5000s became the exclusive passenger vehicle of Metrolink on 1 May 2014.
Metrolink has one Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) from 1991.

Depots

Metrolink House at Queens Road in Cheetham Hill is the headquarters of Metrolink.

Wi-Fi

In July 2013, the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee announced that it planned to enhance the experience of travelling on Metrolink by tapping in to Manchester City Council's grant from the UK Urban Broadband Fund and using it to provide Metrolink passengers with free Wi-Fi when on board. The scheme began with a trial on a single tram - number 3054 - connected to the FreeBeeMcr broadband network with the intention of rolling it out across the whole Metrolink network by Spring 2015.

Travelling

Service and hours of operation

Before inauguration, GMPTE's original concept was for Metrolink's operator to provide a service every ten minutes from Bury-to-Piccadilly and Altrincham-to-Piccadilly 
A survey in 2012 revealed that passengers who used Metrolink everyday for commuting rated service levels as poor and/or unreliable, with those respondents particularly frustrated by delays and disruptions. TfGM recognised that the older vehicles in its fleet – the T68/T68As — are outdated and the cause of much disruption, and agreed to replace them with M5000s by 2014. Among those who used Metrolink less regularly, the system scored far better in the survey. A survey in 2014 by the non-departmental government body Passenger Focus found that of the five major light rail systems in the United Kingdom - Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, NET, Midland Metro and Blackpool tramway - Metrolink had the lowest overall satisfaction rating in the United Kingdom. Respondents were surveyed on value for money, punctuality, seating availability, tram stations and overall satisfaction. Metrolink was below average on all criteria, and 47% believed Metrolink was value for money compared to a national average of 60%.
Monday to Saturday service:
The combined Monday-Saturday daytime frequency on the Bury and Altrincham routes is every 6 minutes.
Sunday and public holiday service:

Ticketing

Metrolink fares were originally set by the system's operator,

Patronage

According to TfGM, more than 21 million passenger journeys were made in 2011, to 19.6 million for the 2009/10 fiscal year. Metrolink revised its method for calculating passenger boardings in 2010/11, meaning figures are not directly comparable with previous years. TfGM predicts around 22 million passenger journeys on Metrolink in 2012, and an increase of 46% by 2026.
A survey in 2012 revealed that 12%, or around one in 10 people in Greater Manchester use Metrolink to travel to work, and 8% use the system every day. The system is most commonly used by 21 to 30-year olds, and was used most markedly by residents of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury — accounting for around a third of their commuter journeys.
