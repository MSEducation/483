CATEGORIES: 2002 singles, No Angels songs

"Let's Go to Bed" is a song performed by German pop group No Angels. It was written by Mousse T. and frequent collaborator Errol Rennalls for the band's second studio album Now... Us! (2002), while production was handled by the former. Musically, the track is a mid-paced pop song that is set in retro style. It contains heavy elements of psychedelic soul and funk music, with its instrumentation led by a bass guitar. "Let's Go to Bed" contains lyrics that reference to a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, leading up to a desire to invite a love interest to come to bed.
The song was well received by contemporary music critics, who noted it the album's standout track and felt it was a breakaway from the Europop genre widely associated with the group; they also praised its production. On November 4, 2002, a beat-heavy remix of "Let's Go to Bed" was released as the album's third single in German-speaking Europe by Polydor. It became the No Angels's first single to miss the top ten on the German Singles Chart when it peaked at number twelve. In Austria, the song barely reached the top fifty, while in Switzerland, the funk track failed to chart on the Swiss Singles Chart. Altogether, it sold more than 100,000 copies Europe-wide but emerged as the band's lowest-selling single before their disbandment in 2003.
The single's accompanying music video was directed by Marcus Sternberg and filmed inside the New Trade Fair building in Leipzig in early October 2002. It features the girls in black dresses seductively dancing in front of architecture by Gerkan, Marg and Partners and Ian Ritchie Architects. Mousse T. makes a cameo appearance in the video.
