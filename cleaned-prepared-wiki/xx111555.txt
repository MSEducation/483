Richard "Dick" Savitt (born March 4, 1927) is a   
In 1951, at the age of 24, he won both the Australian and Wimbledon men's singles championships. Savitt was mostly ranked World No. 2 the same year behind fellow amateur Frank Sedgman, though was declared World No. 1 by The New York Times and The Owosso Argus-Press following his Wimbledon victory."Dick Savitt Beats Ken McGregor Again for Men's Singles Title", The Owosso Argus-Press, July 7, 1951. He retired the following year.
Savitt is one of four American men who have won both the Australian and British Championships in one year, following Don Budge (1938) and preceding Jimmy Connors (1974) and Pete Sampras (1994 & 1997).

Early life

Savitt is Jewish, and was born in Bayonne, New Jersey.  He taught himself tennis at the age of 14, but never took a tennis lesson in his life.  The self-taught Savitt played tennis well enough, however, to make the finals of the New Jersey Boys Championship and, for two years afterward, the National Boys Tennis Tournament before moving up to the junior ranks.
His first love was basketball, though, and when his family moved to Texas, he was an All-State forward and a co-captain of his El Paso, Texas high school basketball team in 1944.  In 1945 Savitt entered the Navy, and played on a service basketball team.  
Despite considering tennis his "second" sport after basketball, he won the Texas University Interscholastic League boys singles championship in 1944–45.  Nationally he was the 8th-ranked junior tennis player, and the 17th-ranked amateur overall.

College

In 1946, Cornell University offered Savitt a basketball scholarship.  He attended Cornell, where he majored in Economics, was a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity, and was elected a member of the Sphinx Head Society.  
Savitt resumed playing tennis.  He became Cornell's tennis team captain, # 1 singles and doubles player, and the NCAA champion.  In 1950 he also won the East Clay Court Tournament and the New York State Tournament.  He was 57–2 in singles for his college career, and graduated in June 1950.

Post-college tennis career

Savitt ranked in the world's top 10 four times between 1951 and 1957 (# 2 in 1951); and in the U.S. top 10 six times between 1950 and 1959.  That was despite the fact that Savitt did not compete in 1953–55.  Among Savitt's major victories were the 1951 Wimbledon singles championship and the 1951 Australian Open. He also won the 1952, 1958, and 1961 USLTA National Indoor Championships, becoming the first player to win that crown three times, and won the Italian doubles and the Canadian singles and doubles championships.

1950

Without any coaching, in 1950 Savitt reached the U. S. Tennis Championship semifinals at Forest Hills, losing to Art Larsen.

1951

In 1951, at the age of 24, Savitt won the Wimbledon Singles Championship. Along the way he beat Larsen, the # 1 US player, in straight sets, and Herbert Flam, the # 2 US player.  
He also won the Australian Open Singles title, winning in straight sets in the 61-minute final.  He became the first American since Don Budge, 13 years earlier, to win both Wimbledon and the Australian Open in one season.
Savitt also became the first Jewish player to win either tournament.  This, in turn, kept many Jewish tennis players from obtaining the training they needed to compete at the highest levels.
Savitt was ranked 2nd in the world in 1951.  He was also ranked the # 1 player on the United States Davis Cup Team.

1952

He made it to the semi-finals of the Australian Open in January 1952.

Davis Cup snub, and retirement


Although at the top of his game, and only 25 years old, Savitt abruptly retired from competitive tennis after winning the 1952 U.S. National Indoor Singles Championships.  He never publicly discussed the reason for his sudden retirement, but it was considered most likely the result of his snub by the US Davis Cup coach.
Savitt had played and won his three early 1951 Cup matches, winning 9 of 10 sets, en route to leading the American team into the championship round against Australia.  Without Savitt playing singles, and with Schroder losing two of his three matches, the United States lost the 1951 Davis Cup to Australia.
The controversy spilled over into the next year, when the 1951 national rankings were bitterly debated at the January 1952 U.S. Lawn Tennis Association annual meeting.
In February 1952, a distraught Savitt announced that he would play only one more tournament, the National Indoor Championships, and then retire from tournament tennis—at age 25.  As his farewell statement, Savitt won the championship.

Post-retirement tennis career

Savitt returned to the competitive tennis scene part-time in 1956, and though his limited tournament competition prevented him from receiving an official ranking, he was nonetheless considered the number one player in the United States. In 1958, Savitt moved back to New York for business reasons and launched a part-time comeback in tennis. That year, he won his second National Indoors title, and in 1961 he captured his third—while remaining a weekend player.
In 1981, he and his son, Robert, won the U.S. Father-Son doubles title.

Style of play

In his prime, Savitt was considered the greatest back-court player in the game, with the hardest ground strokes.  He also had a booming serve.  Savitt was also enormously competitive. His contemporaries described him as almost driven, a man who hated to lose.

Maccabiah Games; Israel

In 1961, he won gold medals in both singles and doubles (with Mike Franks) at the 1961 Maccabiah Games in Israel, the third-largest sporting event in the world.
In his 2007 book The Big Book of Jewish Sports Heroes: An Illustrated Compendium of Sports History and The 150 Greatest Jewish Sports Stars, author Peter S. Horvitz ranked Savitt the 9th-greatest Jewish athlete of all time.

Halls of Fame

He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1976.  Savitt, who is Jewish, was also inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1979.  He was inducted into the Cornell University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1978.

After tennis

After his tennis career, Savitt entered the oil business in Louisiana.  He then worked for Lehman Brothers on Wall Street, and in 1985 joined Schroders.
