Service Quality

Ever since RAKBANK's relaunch in 2001 as a retail bank, its corporate emphasis was on customer satisfaction and one of its first appointments was to recruit a team dedicated to service quality.
Excellence in customer service has become a central theme of the Bank's activities and staff. RAKBANK earned a reputation for offering one of the highest levels of customer service in the industry by topping, the annual  Service Quality Bank Benchmarking Study conducted by independent service specialists Ethos Consultancy from 2005 to 2010.
In addition, RAKBANK is always among the top three in the list compiled by Gulf News that recognizes companies in the UAE for consistent and thorough customer service feedback.

Marketing Approach

Advertising has played a key role in the Bank's emergence as a leading retail bank in the UAE over the last decade. RAKBANK's advertising approach is summarized by its internal marketing guidelines in what the Bank calls its 'Four Cs of Marketing', requiring all marketing messages to be Crystal Clear, Confident, Cheeky and Combative. Even during the economic downturn in early 2009, RAKBANK lived up to its guidelines by openly addressing the credit crunch in its flyers, billboards and broadcasts including a drive around Valentine with the slogan of 'don't let the credit crunch ruin your life' and encouraging jewelry purchases via credit cards.
More recently, RAKBANK won the Gold Summit Creative Award for its AMAL TVC campaign, which featured the talking eggs after competing against 5,000 other submissions from around the world at the 2013 Summit International Award in the United States.
In mid-2009, a campaign promoted the Titanium Credit Card under the theme of "Don't Get Bitten by Other Cards", centered on a creature that lurks in people's wallets waiting to bite.  
The campaign also included an online game, which pitted the RAKBANK Titanium card, personified through the RAKMAN superhero, used in previous advertisements. Players who correctly answered all questions got more chances to win Titanium semi-annual million-dirham draw, once they apply for a credit card.
In late 2009, the Bank conducted a full takeover of bus-shelters branded from top to bottom as part of a larger campaign to promote the Bank's prize of a new apartment for its winning account holder.
RAKBANK won the "Best Marketing Campaign of the Year" award at the Middle East Prepaid Awards 2012 for its MasterCard Bling campaign, a light-hearted and bold marketing campaign which delivered results in both uptake and return on investment.
