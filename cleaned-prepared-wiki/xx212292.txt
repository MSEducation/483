His father died when Masahiko was 11. By the wishes of his mother, at age 15 he started spending his time as an apprentice under the bonsai master Motosuke Hamano of Toju-en Bonsai Garden. This was for eleven years until about 1966.  (Kimura would later say that during his teens he really wanted to be a rock and roll musician.)[ref]

He went on to become known as the "Magical Technician of Kindai Shuppan."
Because of Kimura's willingness to break with convention, many in Japan refused to take him seriously, at least in the early years. Nowadays, no one disputes Kimura's genius or his pioneering position in the bonsai world. 
His work as documented in the form of articles and photographs has graced the pages of many major specialty publications around the world. 
Katsuhito Onishi edited the Japanese texts The Magical Technician of Kindai Shuppan in 1982, Part II in 1984, and Part III in 1989. The English version, made up of Part II with some of Part I, was published as The Bonsai Art of Kimura by Stone Lantern Publishing Co. in 1992.
Kimura's wife, who often greeted tours to their Omiya garden and served tea and goodies to the visitors, died November 23, 2009.
