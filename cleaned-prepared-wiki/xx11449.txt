[[Economy of Venezuela]]

CATEGORIES: Economy of Venezuela, World Trade Organization member economies, OPEC

The economy of Venezuela is largely based on the petroleum sector and manufacturing.S. Department of State. Retrieved 29 October 2011. Revenue from petroleum exports accounts for more than 50% of the country's GDP and roughly 95% of total exports. Venezuela is the fifth largest member of OPEC by oil production. From the 1950s to the early 1980s the Venezuelan economy experienced a steady growth that attracted many immigrants, with the nation enjoying the highest standard of living in Latin America. During the collapse of oil prices in the 1980s the economy contracted, and inflation skyrocketed to reach peaks of 84% in 1989 and 99% in 1996, three years prior to Hugo Chavez taking office. With high oil prices and rising government expenditures, Venezuela's economy grew by 9% in 2007.
Manufacturing contributed 17% of GDP in 2006. Venezuela manufactures and exports heavy industry products such as steel, aluminium and cement, with production concentrated around Ciudad Guayana, near the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world and the provider of about three-quarters of Venezuela's electricity. Other notable manufacturing includes electronics and automobiles, as well as beverages, and foodstuffs. Agriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 3% of GDP, 10% of the labor force, and at least one-fourth of Venezuela's land area. Venezuela exports rice, corn, fish, tropical fruit, coffee, beef, and pork. The country is not self-sufficient in most areas of agriculture.
The United States is Venezuela's most important trading partner. U.S. exports to Venezuela include machinery, agricultural products, medical instruments, and autos. Venezuela is one of the top four suppliers of foreign oil to the United States. About 500 U.S. companies are represented in Venezuela. According to Central Bank of Venezuela, the government received from 1998 to 2008 around 325 billion USD through oil production and export in general,"Ingresos Petroleros de Venezuela 1999-2008." Centro de Investigaciones Económicas. 21 June 2008. Retrieved 3 September 2010. and according to the International Energy Agency, to June 2010 has production of 2.2 million barrels per day, 800,000 of which go to the United States of America."Crude Oil Supply Vs. OPEC Output Target:Venezuela." IEA Oil Market Report. 11 August 2010. Retrieved 3 September 2010.
Venezuela has been ranked 175 of 178 in economic freedom by the Heritage Foundation and was classified as a "Repressed" economy.

History

1922 - 1964

When oil was discovered at the Maracaibo strike in 1922, Venezuela's dictator, Juan Vicente Gómez, allowed US oil companies to write Venezuela's petroleum law. The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power. New York:Simon and Schuster. 1990. pp 233-36; 432  But oil history was made in 1943 when Standard Oil of New Jersey accepted a new agreement in Venezuela based on the 50-50 principle, "a landmark event."Yergin 1990, p 435 Terms even more favorable to Venezuela were negotiated in 1945, after a coup brought to power a left-leaning government that included Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso.
From the 1950s to the early 1980s the Venezuelan economy was the strongest in South America. The continuous growth during that period attracted many immigrants.
In 1958 a new government again included Pérez Alfonso, who devised a plan for the international oil cartel that would become OPEC.Yergin 1990, p 767
During Pérez Jimenez' dictatorship from 1952 to 1958, Venezuela enjoyed remarkably high GDP growth, so that in the late 1950s Venezuela's real GDP per capita almost reached West Germany's. On 1950, Venezuela was the world's 4th largest wealthiest nation per capitaNationMaster. "GDP per capita in 1950 statics.". However, from 1958/1959 onward, Romulo Betancourt (president from 1959 to 1964) inherited an enormous internal and external debt caused by rampant public spending during the dictatorship. Nevertheless, he managed to balance Venezuela's public budget and initiate an unsuccessful agrarian reform. "Nature and Progress of Agrarian Reform in Latin America." The Journal of Economic History. Vol. 23, No. 4 (Dec. 1963), pp 559-573.

1960s - 1990s

Buoyed by a strong oil sector in the 1960s and 1970s,Venezuela's governments were able to maintain social harmony by spending fairly large amounts on public programs including health care, education, transport, and food subsidies.  "Great strides were made in literacy and welfare programs." McCaughan, Michael. The Battle of Venezuela. New York: Seven Stories Press. 2005. p 63.
Because of the oil wealth, Venezuelan workers "enjoyed the highest wages in Latin America."McCaughan, Michael. The Battle of Venezuela. London: Latin America Bureau. 2004. p 31.
This situation was reversed when oil prices collapsed during the 1980s. The economy contracted, and the number of people living in poverty rose from 36% in 1984 to 66% in 1995. The country suffered a severe banking crisis (Venezuelan banking crisis of 1994).
As the economy contracted in the 1980s, inflation levels (consumer price inflation) fell, remaining between 6 and 12% from 1982 to 1986."Venezuela Inflation rate (consumer prices)". Indexmundi. 2010. Retrieved 16 August 2010. In the late 80s and early 90s inflation rose to around 30 - 40% annually, with a 1989 peak of 84%. The mid-1990s saw annual rates of 50-60% (1993 to 1997) with an exceptional peak in 1996 at 99.88%. Subsequently inflation has remained in a range of around 15% to 30%.
By 1998, the economic crisis had grown even worse. Per capita GDP was at the same level as 1963 (after adjusting 1963 dollar to 1998 value), down a third from its 1978 peak; and the purchasing power of the average salary was a third of its 1978 level. p207

1999 - 2012

Hugo Chávez was elected president in December 1998 and took office in February 1999. His economic policies have been more socialistic than those of his predecessors. In the first four years of the Chávez presidency, the economy grew at first (1999–2001), then contracted from 2001 - 2003 to GDP levels similar to 1997, at first because of low oil prices, then because of the turmoil caused by the 2002 coup attempt and the 2002-2003 business strike. Other factors in the decline were an exodus of capital from the country, and a reluctance of foreign investors. Gross Domestic Product was 50.0 trillion bolivares in 1998. At the bottom of the recession, 2003, it was 42.4 trillion bolivares (in constant 1998 bolivares). However, with a calmer political situation in 2004, GDP rebounded 50.1 trillion bolivares, and has risen strongly since, to 66.1 trillion bolivares in 2007 (both in constant 1998 bolivares). Particularly important in the recovery was the defeat of the opposition management at PDVSA after the 2002-2003 lockout/strike, which gave the government, for the first time, actual control of the state oil company and allowed the pursuit of a unified economic policy. Sections: 'Executive Summary,' and 'Social Spending, Poverty, and Employment.'
In response to the low oil prices at the end of the 1990s, Chavez played a leading role within OPEC to reinvigorate that organisation and obtain members' adherence to lower production quotas designed to drive up the oil price. Venezuelan oil minister Alí Rodríguez Araque's announcement in 1999 that his country would respect OPEC production quotas marked "a historic turnaround from the nation's traditional pro-US oil policy." McCaughan 2004, p 73.
Rising petroleum prices in 2000 took some pressure off the budget and currency. However, with the president's economic cabinet attempting to reconcile a wide range of views, the country's economic reform program had largely stalled. Reforms that were undertaken included the reduction or abolition of education, healthcare and nutrition fees to millions of Venezuelans.
The government sought international assistance to finance reconstruction after massive flooding and landslides in December 1999 caused an estimated US$15 billion to $20 billion in damage.
The hardest hit sectors in the worst recession years, 2002–2003, were construction (−55.9%), petroleum (−26.5%), commerce (−23.6%) and manufacturing (−22.5%). The drop in the petroleum sector was caused by adherence to the OPEC quota established in 2002 and the virtual cessation of exports during the PdVSA-led Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003. The non-petroleum sector of the economy contracted by 6.5% in 2002. The bolivar, which has been suffering from serious inflation and devaluation relative to international standards since the late 1980s,UN data site >> World Bank estimates >> GDP deflator, national currency. continued to weaken.
The inflation rate, as measured by consumer price index, was 35.8% in 1998, falling to a low of 12.5% in 2001 and rising to 31.1% in 2003. Historically, the highest yearly inflation was 99.9% in 1996. On 23 January 2003, in an attempt to support the bolivar and bolster the government's declining level of international reserves, as well as to mitigate the adverse impact from the oil industry work stoppage on the financial system, the Ministry of Finance and the central bank suspended foreign exchange trading. On 6 February, the government created CADIVI, a currency control board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures. The board set the US dollar exchange rate at 1,596 bolivares to the dollar for purchases and 1,600 to the dollar for sales.
The housing market in Venezuela has shrunk significantly in recent years. Developers have avoided Venezuela due to the massive number of companies who have had their property expropriated by the government. There are currently thousands of occupants still inside of the complex today.
The Venezuelan economy shrank 5.8 percent in the first three months of 2010 compared to the same period last yearToothaker, Christopher. "Chavez: Venezuela's economy soon to recover." Bloomberg Businessweek. 8 August 2010. Retrieved 3 September 2010. and now has the highest inflation rate in Latin America (30.5%). President Hugo Chavez expressed optimism that Venezuela would soon emerge from recession, despite the International Monetary Fund forecasts showing that Venezuela would be the only country in the region to remain in recession that year. "Chavez Says Venezuela's Economy Is `Already Recovering' Amid Recession." Bloomberg. 8 August 2010. Retrieved 3 September 2010. However after Chavez's death in early 2013, Venezuela's economy continued to fall into an even greater recession.

2013 - present

According to the 2013 Global Misery Index Scores, Venezuela was ranked as the top spot globally with the highest misery index score.
Venezuela's bond ratings have also decreased multiple times in 2013 due to decisions by President Nicolás Maduro. One of his decisions was to force stores and their warehouses to sell all of their products, which may lead to even more shortages in the future.
The year 2014 does not look much better for Venezuela, as analysts believe the country will continue tumbling deeper into recession, and another devaluation of the bolívar seems imminent.
In March 2014, the executive director of the Venezuelan Association of Hospitals and Clinics explained how in less than a month, shortages of 53 medical products rose to 109 products and explained how the CADIVI system is to blame since 86% of supplies are imported.
In April 2014, the International Monetary fund said that activity in Venezuela is uncertain but may continue to slow saying that "loose macroeconomic policies have generated high inflation and a drain on official foreign exchange reserves". The IMF suggested that "more significant policy changes are needed to stave off a disorderly adjustment".

Sectors

Petroleum and other resources

Venezuela is a major producer of petroleum products, which remain the keystone of the Venezuelan economy. The International Energy Agency shows how Venezuela's oil production has fallen in the last years, producing only  "Contribución petrolera se duplica por ajuste cambiario." El Universal. 11 January 2010. Retrieved 3 September 2010.
A range of other natural resources, including iron ore, coal, bauxite, gold, nickel, and diamonds, are in various stages of development and production. In April 2000, Venezuela's President decreed a new mining law, and regulations were adopted to encourage greater private sector participation in mineral extraction. During Venezuela's economic crisis, the rate of gold excavated fell 64.1% between February 2013 and February 2014 and iron production dropped 49.8%.
Venezuela utilizes vast hydropower resources to supply power to the nation's industries. The national electricity law is designed to provide a legal framework and to encourage competition and new investment in the sector. After a 2-year delay, the government is proceeding with plans to privatize the various state-owned electricity systems under a different scheme than previously envisioned.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing contributed 15% of GDP in 2009. The manufacturing sector is experiencing severe difficulties, amidst lack of investment and accusations of mismanagement.  Venezuela manufactures and exports steel, aluminium, transport equipment, textiles, apparel, beverages, and foodstuffs. It produces cement, tires, paper, fertilizer, and assembles cars both for domestic and export markets.

Agriculture

Agriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 3% of GDP, 10% of the labor force, and at least a quarter of Venezuela's land area. Venezuela exports rice, corn, fish, tropical fruit, coffee, beef, and pork. The country is not self-sufficient in most areas of agriculture. Venezuela imports about two-thirds of its food needs. In 2002, U.S. firms exported $347 million worth of agricultural products, including wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, cotton, animal fats, vegetable oils, and other items to make Venezuela one of the top two U.S. markets in South America. The United States supplies more than one-third of Venezuela's food imports. Recent government policies have led to problems with food shortages.

Trade

Thanks to petroleum exports, Venezuela usually posts a trade surplus. In recent years, nontraditional (i.e., nonpetroleum) exports have been growing rapidly but still constitute only about a quarter of total exports. The United States is Venezuela's leading trade partner. During 2002, the United States exported $4.4 billion in goods to Venezuela, making it the 25th-largest market for the U.S. Including petroleum products, Venezuela exported $15.1 billion in goods to the U.S., making it its 14th-largest source of goods. Venezuela opposes the proposed Free Trade Agreement of the Americas.
Since 1998 People's Republic of China-Venezuela relations have seen an increasing partnership between the government of the Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez and the People's Republic of China. Sino-Venezuelan trade was less than $500m per year before 1999, and reached $7.5bn in 2009, making China Venezuela's second-largest trade partner,Suggett, James. "Latest Venezuela-China Deals: Orinoco Agriculture, Civil Aviation, Steel, and $5 Billion Credit Line." Venezuelanalysis. 3 August 2010. Retrieved 3 September 2010. and Venezuela China's biggest investment destination in Latin America. Various bilateral deals have seen China invest billions in Venezuela, and Venezuela increase exports of oil and other resources to China.

Labor

Under Chávez, Venezuela has also instituted worker-run "co-management" initiatives in which workers' councils play a key role in the management of a plant or factory. In experimental co-managed enterprises, such as the state-owned Alcasa factory, workers develop budgets and elect both managers and departmental delegates who work together with company executives on technical issues related to production. "Chavez calls for democracy at work." BBC News. 17 August 2005. Retrieved 22 September 2006.
In November 2010, following the expropriation of U.S. bottle-maker Owens-Illinois, workers spent a week protesting outside factories in Valera and Valencia.

Infrastructure

Venezuela has an extensive road system. The capital Caracas has a modern subway system over 31.6 mi (51 km) long. Maracaibo and Valencia (third city) has recently inaugurated a metro system. The Maracaibo (second city) metro system is still unfinished.
Rail transport in Venezuela has been practically non-existent since the 1950s (with only one line operating), but the IAFE is currently working on several lines, hopefully connecting most of Venezuela via railway by 2020, which, if achieved, would lead to a significant improvement in the countries' transport infrastructure.
The Chavez government launched a National Railway Development Plan designed to create 15 railway lines across the country, with 
Venezuela's electrical grid is plagued with occasional blackouts in various districts of the country. In 2011, it had so many problems that rations on electricity were put in place to help ease blackouts.

On 7 March 2007 the government announced that the Venezuelan bolívar would be redenominated at a ratio of 1 to 1000 at the beginning of 2008 and renamed the bolívar fuerte ("strong bolivar"), to ease accounting and transactions.

With the 2007 rise in oil prices and rising government expenditures, Venezuela's economy grew by 9% in 2007. Oil prices fell starting in July 2008 resulting in a major loss of income. Hit by a global recession, the economy contracted by 2% in the second quarter of 2009,Daniel, Frank. "Venezuela economy shrinks for first time in 5 years." Reuters. 20 August 2009. Retrieved 3 September 2010. contracting a further 4.5% in the third quarter of 2009.

For 17 November 2009 the Central Bank reported that private sector activity declined by 4.5% and that inflation was averaging 26.7%. Compounding such problems is a drought which the government says was caused by El Nino, resulting in rationing of water and electricity and a short supply of food.Márquez, Humberto. "El Niño Dries Up Water, Power, Food Supply." IPS News. 23 October 2009. Retrieved 3 September 2010.
The year 2010 promises a Venezuela still in recession as Gross Domestic Product has fallen by 5.8% in the first quarter of 2010."Venezuela recession drags, GDP falls 5.8 pct Q1". Reuters. 25 May 2010. Retrieved 13 August 2010 The Central Bank has stated that the recession is due largely "to restricted access to foreign currency for imports, lower internal demand and electricity rationing." The oil sector's performance is also particularly troubling, with oil GDP shrinking by 5%. More importantly the Central Bank hints at the root cause of the oil contraction: "the bank said it was due to falls in production, "operative problems", maintenance stoppages and the channeling of diesel to run thermal generators during a power crisis." While the public sector of the economy has fallen 2.8%, the private sector has dropped off an astounding 6%.
The year 2013 proved to be difficult for Venezuela as shortages of necessities and extreme inflation attacked the nation's economy. Items became so scarce that nearly one quarter of items were not in stock.
As the year 2014 began, it was pretty rough as well. The central bank of Venezuela stopped releasing statistics for the first time in its history as a way to possibly manipulate the image of economy. Venezuela has also dismantled CADIVI, a government body in charge of currency exchange.

Currency Black Market

The implied value or "black market value" is what Venezuelans believe the Bolivar Fuerte is worth compared to the United States dollar.
As of January 2014, the official exchange rate is 1 USD to 6.3 VEF while the black market exchange rate is over ten times higher since the actual value of the bolívar is overvalued for Venezuelan businesses. Since merchants can only receive so much necessary foreign currency from the government, they must resort to the black market which in turn raises the merchant's prices on consumers. The high rates in the black market make it difficult for businesses to purchase necessary goods since the government often forces these businesses to make price cuts. 
This leads to businesses selling their goods and making a low profit, such as Venezuelan McDonald's franchises offering a Big Mac meal for only $1.

Socioeconomic indicators

Like most Latin American countries, Venezuela has an unequal distribution of wealth. The rich tend to be very rich and the poor very poor. In 1970, the poorest fifth of the population had 3% of national income, while the wealthiest fifth had 54%. "Table 24." World Development Report. 1980. pp 156–157. For comparison the UK 1973 figures were 6.3% and 38.8%, and the US in 1972, 4.5% and 42.8%.
The more recent income distribution data available is for distribution per capita, not per household. The two are not strictly comparable because poor households tend to have more members than rich households; thus, the per household data tends to show less inequality than the per capita data. The table below shows the available per capita data for recent years from the World bank.
Poverty in Venezuela increased during the 1980s and 1990s but has decreased during the Chávez presidency, with the exception of the troubled years 2002 and 2003. The table below shows the percentage of people, and the percentage of households, whose income is below a poverty line which is equal to the price of a market basket of necessities such as food."Ficha Técnicas de Línea de Pobreza por Ingreso." Estadísticas Sociales y Ambientales. El Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas. Retrieved 4 September 2010. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística describes their method for compiling these statistics.
Note that as an income-based measure of poverty, this omits the effect of some other factors that may affect economic wellbeing, such as the availability of free health care and education.

Social development

In recent years, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, under the direction of President Hugo Chávez, has made leaps in the realm of social development.  With social programs such as the Bolivarian Missions, Venezuela has made progress in areas such as health, education, and poverty.  Through what President Hugo Chávez terms 21st Century Socialism,[ref]Wilpert, Gregory. "The Meaning of 21st Century Socialism for Venezuela." Venezuela Analysis.
11 July 2006. Web. 19 March 2012. .[/ref] Venezuela has been able to fix many of its domestic issues.  Many of the social policy pursued by Chávez and his administration were jumpstarted by the Millennium Development Goals, eight goals that Venezuela and 188 other nations agreed to in September 2000."The Millennium Development Goals Report 2011." United Nations. 2011. Web. 2 April 2012. .  In each of the goals, Venezuela has made improvements, and at this rate, will meet all eight goals by their 2015 deadline.
When the international community agreed to the Millennium Development Goals, each country pledged to use social policy to achieve each of the eight goals.  The former President of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Ali Abdessalam Treki, stated: "What Venezuela has achieved with regards to the Millennium Development Goals should serve as a model for all other countries."Mather, Steven. "UN General Assembly President Praises Venezuela for Development Goals Progress." Venezuela Analysis. 24 June 2010. Web 4 March 2012.
The country has allocated much of its government spending on social policy.  From 1999-2009, 60% of government revenues focused on social programs.  Social investment went from 8.4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1988 to 18.8% in 2008.  Through this social spending, Venezuela has been able to stay on track to reaching the Millennium Development Goals.

Millennium Development Goals

In 2000, the United Nations adopted the Millennium Development Goals, eight goals that combat social problems in our world today."United Nations Millennium Declaration." UN General Assembly. 8 September 2000. Web. 4 March 2012.  The eight goals are as follows: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve universal primary education, promote gender equality and empower women, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensure environmental sustainability, and develop a global partnership for development.  At the September 2010 United Nations Summit, Jorge Valero, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs stated: "Venezuela has achieved the majority of the Millennium Development Goals.""Fact Sheet: Millennium Development Goals." Embassy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 12 October 2010. Web 4 March 2012.

=Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger=

According to Venezuela government statistics, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty was 29.8% in 2003 and decreased to 12.5% in 2006, the year Venezuela officially met the first target of this goal."Venezuela Achieves Millennium Goals." Ministry of People's Power for Communication and Information. 2010. Web 4 March 2012.  The percentage of those living in extreme poverty continued declining and in 2011 was 6.8%."Venezuela Leads on UN Human Development Goals." Australia-Venezuela Solidarity Network. 21 November 2011.

Web 19 March 2012.  In terms of unemployment, Venezuela has been able to lower the rate to 7.5% in 2009 in spite of the global financial crisis.
In relation to hunger, under-nutrition was lowered drastically from its 1998-2000 level of 21% to its 2005-2007 level of 6%.  Between 1998 and 2010, Venezuela's food production increased by 44%.

=Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education=

The total net enrollment ratio in primary education for both sexes increased from 87% in 1999 to 93.9% in 2009.  The primary completion rate for both sexes reached 95.1% in 2009, as compared to 80.8% in 1991.  In 2005, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization declared Venezuela free of illiteracy.  The literacy rates of 15-24 year olds in 2007, for men and women, were 98% and 98.8%, respectively.  The free government program, Misión Robinson, is largely responsible for Venezuela's success with literacy rates.  Since starting in 2003, the program has taught more than 2.3 million people to read and write.  The program has also focused much of its attention on reaching out to geographically isolated and historically excluded members of the population, including indigenous groups and Afro-descendents. "Venezuela Celebrates Five Years Free of Illiteracy." Venezuela Analysis. 7 November 2010. Web. 20 March 2012.  Through improvements in primary education and literacy, Venezuela is on target to achieve this goal by the year 2015.
