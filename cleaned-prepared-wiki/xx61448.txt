NFL player

"The lessons that I learned from professional football were many:  hard work, discipline, focus, the ability to analyze a problem and work through it.  To accept that you don't always win and when you do win that doesn't change who you are."  Alan C. Page, 2005
After graduating from Notre Dame, Page was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings, for whom he played from 1967 until 1978. In 1978, Page joined the Chicago Bears, with whom he played through the 1981 season and where he amassed 40 of his career sacks.
As a right defensive tackle, he had an unusual 3-point stance, placing his left rather than his right hand on the ground. During Page's 15-year NFL tenure, the Vikings won an impressive four conference titles and one league championship. Page was a member of the Vikings' "Purple People Eaters," a defensive line adept at sacking or hurrying the quarterback. Page played in 218 consecutive games without an absence (215 consecutive in the starting line-up), during which he recovered 22 fumbles, made 148½ sacks (Vikings-108½,startribune.

In 1971, Page was named both the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year (the first player to be named such) and the AP's NFL Most Valuable Player. Page was the first defensive player to be named MVP since the award's inception.  Only one other defensive player has ever received the award.  In addition, he was voted the NEA NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1973.

NFL player representative

Page was National Football League Players Association player representative, from 1970 to 1974 and in 1976–1977, and a member of the NFLPA Association Executive Committee from 1972 to 1975. He was named to the Vikings' 40th Anniversary Team in 2000. Along the way, Page was named the Associated Press NFL Defensive Player of the Week three times: Week 9, 1967; Week 8, 1968; Week 13, 1971.

Broadcasting

After his playing career he dabbled in the media, first as a color commentator on Turner Broadcasting System covering the College Football Game of the Week series during the Fall of 1982 and then as a commentator on National Public Radio in 1982-83.

Legal career

Long before Page's football career came to a close, he was laying the groundwork for his future role as a justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court. While still playing for the Vikings, Page attended the University of Minnesota Law School, from which he received a Juris Doctor in 1978. Following graduation, he worked with the law firm Lindquist and Vennum in Minneapolis from 1979 to 1984 outside the football season. In 1985, Page was appointed Special Assistant Attorney General, and was soon thereafter promoted to Assistant Attorney General.
In 1992, Page was elected to an open seat as an Associate Justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court, becoming the first African-American to ever serve on that court.  He was reelected in 1998 (becoming the biggest vote-getter in Minnesota history), again in 2004, and for a final time in 2010: Minnesota has mandatory retirement for judges at age 70.
On January 7, 2009, Page was appointed by Chief Justice Eric Magnuson to select the three-judge panel that heard the election contest brought by Norm Coleman in the 2008 U.S. Senate election.

Community

In 1988, Page and his wife Diane founded the Page Education Foundation. That Foundation provides much-needed financial and mentoring assistance to students of color in exchange for those students' commitment to further volunteer service in the community. As of May 2012 the Page Foundation has awarded grants to 5,000 students, who in turn have given over 350,000 hours of their own time to young children. Upon his retirement from the bench, Justice Page hopes to become a public school teacher so that he might make an even more personal impact on the children the Foundation has served.
Since 1996, Page has volunteered to be a "reading buddy" in the Everybody Wins reading program at a local elementary school.
Page's contributions to the community have not gone unnoticed, and he has been the recipient of a number of awards recognizing the impact he has made on the lives of children throughout the nation.  He has also received Honorary Doctorates in Humane Letters from the University of Notre Dame, Winston-Salem State University, and Gustavus Adolphus College, as well as Honorary Doctorates of Laws from the University of Notre Dame, St. John's University, Westfield State College, Luther College, and the University of New Haven.
Page has a passion for running and runs on a regular basis. In 1979 he became the first active NFL player to complete a marathon. His running routine, which he took up while helping his wife quit smoking, is believed to have contributed to his dismissal from the Minnesota Vikings. His running schedule of 35–40 miles per week during the season, and 55 miles per week in the offseason, caused his weight to drop below that dictated by the Vikings. "A lineman who runs and runs". St. Petersburg Times. Oct 22, 1978 He ran the Ultimate Runner (mile, 10K, 100, 400, 800, marathon all in one day). In 1987, he completed the Edmund Fitzgerald 100k Road Race in Duluth, Minnesota.

In 2010, Bill McGrane wrote a biography of Page titled All Rise, The Remarkable Journey of Alan Page.
In 2013, Page and his daughter Kamie Page wrote a children's book, Alan and His Perfectly Pointy Impossibly Perpendicular Pinky. Proceeds from the sale of this book help support the Page Education Foundation.
