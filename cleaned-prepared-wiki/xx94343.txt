The 1979 Atlantic hurricane season was the first Atlantic hurricane season to include both male and female names. The hurricane season began on June 1 and ended on November 30. Although the season had 27 tropical depressions, it was inactive due to only 9 named storms. The first tropical cyclone, an unnumbered tropical depression, developed on June 9 and dissipated a few days with no impact. Tropical Depression One, the next system, caused significant flooding in Jamaica. Later in June, Tropical Storm Ana caused minimally impact in the Lesser Antilles. Hurricane Bob, the first male named storm in the Atlantic, caused moderate damage in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Tropical Storm Claudette dropped up to  of rain in Texas, causing moderate damage from flooding. 
The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane David, a Category 5 hurricane that caused devastation in Dominican Republic, as well as significant impact in the Lesser Antilles and the Southeastern United States. David caused $1.54 billion (1979 USD) in damage and at least 2,068 fatalities. Another significant storm, Hurricane Frederic, resulted in extensive impact, especially in the United States, where it was the costliest tropical cyclone on record, at the time. Tropical Depression Eight, Tropical Storm Elena, Hurricane Henri, an unnumbered tropical depression in September, and Subtropical Storm One all caused minor effects on land. Several of the tropical cyclones also moved in close proximity to land, but impact is unknown. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the season resulted in $4.27 billion in damage and at least 2,118 deaths.

Season summary

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1979. Although 27 tropical cyclones developed, only nine of them became nameable storms, which is slightly below the 1950-2000 average of 9.6 named storms per season. Of the nine tropical storms, five of them strengthened into a hurricane, which is also slightly below average. Two of the five hurricane became major hurricanes, which is Category 3 or greater on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Three tropical storms, one subtropical storm, and three hurricanes made landfall during the season and caused at least 2,118 fatalities and $4.27 billion (1979 USD). Despite its intensity, Tropical Depression One also resulted in notorious impact in Jamaica. The last storm of the season, an unnamed subtropical storm, dissipated on November 15, about 15 days before the official end of hurricane season on November 30.   
The 1979 season was an average but destructive season with 27 depressions, with nine reaching tropical storm strength.  The notable cyclones include Tropical Depression One which caused one of Jamaica's worst natural disasters. Tropical Storm Claudette became one of the most destructive tropical storms of all time and created a 24-hour rainfall record for the United States. Hurricane David peaked at Category 5 status becoming the first hurricane of such strength to make landfall directly in the Dominican Republic, killing over 2,000 people. Hurricane Frederic became a weak Category 4 hurricane with winds of , causing over $4–8 billion in damage (2005 USD) to some of the same areas impacted by Hurricane David. Hurricane Henri formed in Mid-September in the Gulf of Mexico and never made landfall, which is a rare occurrence. Damage for the whole season totaled out to $4.27 billion (1979 USD).
The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 93. the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase.
