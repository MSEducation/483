Endeavor Air (formerly Pinnacle Airlines, and before that, Express Airlines I) is an American regional airline that operates as Delta Connection for Delta Air Lines.

History

The airline was established in February 1985 as Express Airlines I with the intent of offering regional airline passenger feed to a code sharing, major airline's hub. Express I began its first code sharing agreement with Republic Airlines in May 1985. Express I was able to accomplish this by beginning service on June 1, 1985, to 3 cities using BAe Jetstream 31 aircraft.  Within six months, Express Airlines I was operating in ten markets using nine Jetstream 31s and two Saab 340 aircraft.
On December 15, 1985, a second contract opened operations at a Republic Airlines home base at Minneapolis-St. Paul. By its first anniversary, Republic Express was operating 20 Jetstream 31s and seven Saab 340s in 32 markets. In Spring 1986, Northwest Airlines announced the acquisition of Republic, which was completed on October 1, 1986, following regulatory and shareholder approvals.
Over the next decade, Express I provided airline services to 56 cities in the Southeast and upper Mid-West. In 1997, Northwest Airlines elected to make changes in the structure of Express I, which was a privately held company. On April 1, 1997, Express I became a wholly owned subsidiary of Northwest Airlines. In order to consolidate the many Airlink systems operated at that time, Express I transferred flying at Minneapolis-St. Paul, allowing it to concentrate on the Memphis Hub.
In August 1997, Express I moved its corporate headquarters to Memphis, allowing all the various departments to function from its main base of operations. On 7 May 1999, Express I announced a major transition into the jet age as its parent company announced that Express would be the launch operator of the Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ) at Northwest. This award was for a minimum of 42 CRJs designated to operate as Northwest Jet Airlink. Delivery of the CRJs began in April 2000 and the first Northwest CRJ lifted into the sky on June 1, 2000, bound for Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport (GSP). The first CRJ (N8390A) was named "The Spirit of Memphis Belle," although it has since been repainted into Delta Connection colors, but the title "The Spirit of Memphis Belle" still remains painted on the forward part of the fuselage. Express I changed its name to Pinnacle Airlines on May 8, 2002.

Current operations

Northwest agreed with Pinnacle on a new Air Service Agreement (ASA) on December 21, 2006.  The agreement contracted Pinnacle to fly 124 CRJs until 2017.  A clause within the ASA stipulates that if Pinnacle and Air Line Pilots Association did not agree on a new pilot contract by 31 March 2007, then Northwest could remove up to 17 CRJs from Pinnacle's fleet. After the deadline passed with no new pilot contract, Northwest exercised its right to remove 17 CRJs from Pinnacle, starting in September 2008 at a rate of two CRJs per month. Ironically, these 17 CRJs were removed from Pinnacle and handed over to Mesaba Airlines in 2008, which Pinnacle acquired in 2010.
Northwest had also allowed Pinnacle to seek flying from other carriers. On April 30, 2007, Pinnacle Airlines Corp. signed a 10-year contract with Delta Air Lines to be a Delta Connection carrier. The 16 Bombardier CRJ 900's began delivery in November 2007 and the deliveries were completed in May 2009. The first batch of delivered aircraft were based in Atlanta and began service in December 2007. On June 10, 2008 Pinnacle announced that Delta planned to withdraw from the contract by 31 July 2008 for failure to make its timetable. However, on July 18, 2008 Delta announced that an agreement had been reached that would allow Pinnacle to continue flying for Delta under the terms of the initial contract. The remaining 4 CRJ-900s would be delivered between January and May 2009, at which point all 15 CRJ-900s would be in service for Delta Connection.
On January 18, 2007, Colgan Air, Inc. was acquired by Pinnacle Airlines Corporation for $20 million. Under the terms of the purchase, Colgan's regional aircraft fleet continued to operate independently of Pinnacle Airlines Corporation's major subsidiary, Pinnacle Airlines Inc..
On July 1, 2010, Delta Air Lines sold its wholly owned subsidiary Mesaba Aviation Inc. to Memphis-based Pinnacle in a $62 million transaction. Mesaba's fleet consisted of 41 CRJ-900's and 18 CRJ-200's, while downsizing it's fleet of Saab 340 aircraft. The addition of Mesaba caused Pinnacle to announce that of an asset transfer, where all the jets operating for both carriers would become part of Pinnacle Airlines Inc.. The Colgan operating certificate would be renamed Mesaba and the Mesaba operating certificate would be phased out. This never came to fruition, and all pilots flying for Mesaba and Colgan eventually became pilots for Memphis-based Pinnacle Airlines Inc.
On February 24, 2012, Pinnacle invoked a 5% permanent pay cut for all pilots – a move which CEO Sean Menke insisted was necessary to prevent the company from filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection."Pinnacle, Pilots At Odds Over Permanent Pay Cut." Aviation Week.  Less than a month later on March 21 of 2012 however, Menke was given a 60% pay raise from $425,000 to $675,000 along with executive vice president John Spanjers receiving a 45% raise from $275,000 to $400,000."Embattled Pinnacle Airlines gives CEO Menke 60% pay raise." Memphis Business Journal. Ten days later, Pinnacle filed for Chapter 11 on April 1, 2012.
The airline has 8,000 employees (at May 2012 – number previous its Chapter 11 restructuring).
In January 2013, Delta Air Lines reached a deal to buy Pinnacle Airlines after the Pinnacle emerged from bankruptcy protection.
On June 26, 2013, it was announced that Pinnacle Airlines would be rebranded as Endeavor Air.

Board of directors

Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Petition

On 1 April 2012, Pinnacle Airlines Corp., the parent of Pinnacle Airlines Inc., along with its other subsidiaries including Colgan Air, Inc., filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The airline planned to discontinue its operation of its Saab 340 and Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft by the end of November 2012. The Q400s flying for United Express were picked up by Republic Airlines for United.

Destinations

Endeavor Air flies out of every domestic Delta Air Lines hub. Flying as Delta Connection, it operates 163 regional jets on 1,000 daily flights to more than 100 cities in the United States and Canada.endeavorair.

Fleet

As of April 2014, the Endeavor Air fleet includes the following aircraft:

Delta's current fleet plan for Endeavor Air is 81 CRJ-900's.  Twenty eight CRJ-900's are scheduled for delivery in 2014. The CRJ-200 jets began being phased out in summer 2013. All CRJ-200s will be retired or returned to lessors by the end of 2014.
Endeavor Air has seven maintenance bases at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, Central Wisconsin Airport, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Des Moines International Airport, Fort Wayne International Airport, Greenville–Spartanburg International Airport, McGhee Tyson Airport and Indianapolis International Airport. The company's maintenance base at Memphis International Airport was closed during Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and additional Endeavor Air maintenance bases may close in the near future due to the planned fleet downsizing from 181 to 81 aircraft and the closings of the Atlanta and Memphis pilot/flight attendant bases.
