Hari is a Tamil film director, best known for his action-masala films. 

Background

Hari was born in Katchanavilai near Nazareth in Tuticorin District, Tamil Nadu, India. His father, Gopal Nadar, is a vessels merchant. Later his family moved to Chennai, where Hari was schooling and had a graduate degree in Commerce.

Career

He first joined as an assistant and gained experience working with directors Natraj in  Valli, Nassar in Avatharam and Alex Pandian. Later he assisted K. Balachander in his film Kalki and worked as an associate director with Saran in films Amarkalam and Parthen Rasithen.
His first film, in 2002, was Thamizh with Prashanth and Simran. Film critic Balaji commented that it was "one of the few movies in recent times where a lot of importance seems to have been attached to the script. In spite of the flimsy story and routine screenplay where a youth grows to be a 'dada', the dialogs elevate the quality of the movie and make it very enjoyable".
In 2010 Hari directed his tenth film, Singam with Suriya, marking their third collaboration. The film was one of the top box office films of the year, which will have Shruti Haasan as the female lead.sify.html
