The Battle of Passchendaele (or  Third Battle of Ypres or "Passchendaele") 
A campaign in Flanders was controversial in 1917 and has remained so. British Prime Minister Lloyd George opposed the offensive

Background

Flanders 1914–1917

The Treaty of London (1839) recognized Belgium as an independent and neutral state.
In December 1914, the Admiralty began discussions with the War Office for a combined operation to occupy the Belgian coast to the Dutch frontier, by an attack along the coast combined with a landing at Ostend. Eventually the British were obliged to participate in the French offensives further south.
In January 1916, Haig ordered General Plumer to plan offensives against Messines Ridge, Lille and Houthoulst Forest.
Nivelle planned an operation in three parts, preliminary offensives to pin German reserves by the British at Arras and the French between the Somme and the Oise, a French breakthrough offensive on the Aisne, then pursuit and exploitation. The plan was welcomed by Haig with reservations, which he addressed on 6 January. After repeated insistence on Haig's part, Nivelle agreed to a proviso that if the first two parts of the operation failed to lead to part three, they would be stopped so that the British could move their main forces north for the Flanders offensive, which Haig argued was of great importance to the British government.
Small operations took place in the Ypres salient in 1916, some being German initiatives to distract the Allies from the preparations for the offensive at Verdun and later to try to divert Allied attention from the Battle of the Somme. Other operations were begun by the British, to regain territory or to evict the Germans from ground overlooking their positions. Engagements took place on 12 February at Boesinge and on 14 February at Hooge and Sanctuary Wood. There were actions on 
In January 1917, the Second Army (II Anzac, IX, X and VIII corps) held the line in Flanders from Laventie to Boesinghe, with 11 divisions and up to two in reserve. There was much trench mortaring, mining and raiding by both sides, and from January to May the Second Army had 

Strategic background

Several British and French operations took place beyond Flanders during the 3rd Ypres campaign, intended to assist Allied operations at Ypres, by obstructing the flow of munitions and reinforcements to the German Fourth Army in Belgium and to exploit opportunities created by the German need to economise elsewhere. German offensives in Russia and against Italy were postponed several times as the demand for men and munitions in Flanders left little available for other operations and the French army was able to continue its recuperation after the Nivelle Offensive.

Prelude

Geography and climate

The front line around Ypres had changed relatively little since the end of the Second Battle of Ypres (
In Flanders, sands, gravels and marls predominate, in places covered by silts. The coastal strip is sand but a short way inland, the ground rises to the vale of Ypres, which before 1914 was a flourishing market garden.
Underneath the soil is London clay, sand and silt; according to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission categories of sand, sandy soils and well-balanced soils, Messines ridge is "well-balanced soil" and the ground around Ypres is "sandy soil".

British plans for a Flanders campaign

Preparations for operations in Flanders began in 1915, with the doubling of the Hazebrouck–Ypres rail line and the building of a new line Bergues–Proven which was doubled in early 1917. Progress on roads, rail lines, railheads and spurs in the Second Army zone was continuous and by mid-1917 gave the area the most efficient supply system of the British Expeditionary Force in France. Several plans and memoranda for a Flanders offensive were produced between January 1916 and May 1917, in which the writers tried to relate the offensive resources available to the terrain and the likely German defence. In early 1916 the importance of the capture of the Gheluvelt plateau for an advance further north was emphasised by Haig and the army commanders.
On 14 February 1917 Colonel Macmullen of the GHQ staff, proposed that the plateau be taken by a mass tank attack, reducing the need for artillery; in April a reconnaissance by Captain G. le Q Martel found that the area was unsuitable for tanks.
On 1 May 1917, Haig wrote that the Arras and Nivelle Offensives had weakened the German army but that a decisive blow would be premature.

German defences in Flanders

The Fourth Army had 
German anxiety that the British would exploit their victory at Messines by advancing to the Bassevillebeek (Tower Hamlets) spur beyond the north end of Messines ridge, led Crown Prince Rupprecht on 9 June to propose a withdrawal to the 
On 25 June Ludendorff suggested to Rupprecht that Group Ypres should withdraw to the 

Messines Ridge: 7–17 June

The first stage in the British plan was a preparatory attack on the German positions south of Ypres at Messines ridge. These German positions dominated Ypres and unless neutralised, would be able to enfilade any British attack eastwards from the salient.

Kerensky offensive

The Russian army launched the Kerensky Offensive in an attempt to honour the agreement struck with its allies at the Chantilly meeting of 15–16 November 1916. After the brief success of the Kerensky Offensive 1–19 July and its disastrous sequel, when Ludendorff's general reserve of six divisions captured Riga, 

Battles of the Third Ypres campaign

First phase, Gough's command: May – August

Haig selected Gough to command the offensive on 30 April and on 10 June Gough took over the Ypres salient north of Messines Ridge. Gough  planned an offensive based on the GHQ 1917 plan and the instructions he had received from Sir Douglas Haig.

=Battle of Pilckem Ridge: 31 July – 2 August=

The British attack began at 3.50 am on 31 July. The attack was meant to commence at dawn but low cloud meant that it was still dark.

=Capture of Westhoek: 10 August=

II Corps attacked on 10 August to capture the rest of the black line on the Gheluvelt plateau not held on 31 July. The advance succeeded but German artillery fire and infantry counter-attacks isolated the British infantry of 18th Division, which had captured Glencorse Wood. At about 

=Battle of Hill 70=

The Battle of Hill 70 was a subsidiary operation between the Canadian Corps and five divisions of the German Sixth Army. The battle took place on the outskirts of Lens in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France, 15–25 August. General Von Kuhl wrote later that it was a costly defeat and "wrecked" the plan for relieving divisions which had been "fought-out" in Flanders.

=Battle of Langemarck: 16–18 August=

Fifth Army headquarters was influenced by the effect that delay would have on the coastal operation, which needed the high tides at the end of August or it would have to be postponed for a month. Gough intended the rest of the green line (just beyond the German 

=Subsidiary operations: 19–27 August=

Most of the smaller attacks failed to hold ground, although a XVIII Corps attack on 19 August succeeded. Exploiting observation from higher ground to the east, the Germans were able to inflict heavy losses on the British divisions holding the new line beyond Langemarck. After two fine dry days 17–18 August, XIX and XVIII Corps began pushing closer to the 
Gough  laid down a new infantry formation of skirmish lines followed by "worms" on 24 August. Cavan noted that pill-box defences required broad front attacks so as to engage them simultaneously.

=Second offensive battle of Verdun=

Petain had committed the French Second Army to an attack at Verdun in mid-July in support of the operations in Flanders. The Second Offensive Battle of Verdun was delayed, partly due to the mutinies which had affected the French army after the failure of the Nivelle Offensive and also because a German attack at Verdun from 

Second phase, Plumer takes over: 25 August – 10 November

The German Fourth Army had defeated the British advance to all of the objectives of 31 July during August but the high casualties and sickness caused by the ground conditions, endless bombardments and air attacks intensified the manpower shortage, that the German defensive strategy for 1917 was intended to alleviate.
Plumer's plans continued the development of British attacking methods, which had also taken place in the Fifth Army, during the slow progress in August against the German defence-in-depth and the unusually wet weather. After a pause of about three weeks, Plumer intended to capture Gheluvelt plateau in four steps, with six days between each step to allow time to bring forward artillery and supplies.
The pause in British operations while Plumer moved even more artillery into the area of the Gheluvelt plateau helped to mislead the Germans. Albrecht von Thaer, Staff Officer at Group 

=German defensive changes=

Instead of being one to two miles distant, as on 31 July, on 20 September the British objectives were approximately 
After another severe defeat on 26 September, the German commanders made more changes to the defensive deployment of their troops and altered their counter-attack tactics, which had been negated by Plumer's more conservative form of limited attacks. In July and August, German counter-attack (
Ludendorff ordered a strengthening of forward garrisons by the ground-holding divisions. All available machine-guns, including those of the support and reserve battalions of the front line regiments, were sent into the forward zone to form a cordon of four to eight guns every 

=Battle of the Menin Road Ridge: 20–25 September=

The plan included more emphasis on the use of heavy and medium artillery to destroy German concrete pill-boxes and machine gun nests which were more numerous in the battle zones being attacked and to engage in more counter-battery fire. 
On 20 September the Allies attacked on a 

=Battle of Polygon Wood: 26 September=

The Second Army altered its Corps frontages soon after the attack of 20 September, so that each attacking division could be concentrated on a 

Third phase, the rains return: 4 October – 10 November

=Battle of Broodseinde: 4 October=

The Battle of Broodseinde was the last assault launched by Plumer in good weather.

=German defensive changes=

On 7 October the German Fourth Army again dispersed its troops in the front defence zone. Reserve battalions moved back behind the artillery protective line and the Eingreif divisions were organised to intervene as swiftly as possible once an attack commenced, despite the risk of being devastated by the British artillery. Counter-battery fire to reduce British artillery fire were to be increased to protect the 

=Battle of Poelcappelle: 9 October=

The French First Army and British 2nd and 5th Armies attacked on 9 October on a 

=First Battle of Passchendaele: 12 October=

The First Battle of Passchendaele, on 12 October was another Allied attempt to gain ground around Passchendaele. The heavy rain and mud again made movement difficult and little artillery could be brought closer to the front. Allied troops were exhausted and morale had fallen. After a modest British advance, German counter-attacks recovered most of the ground lost opposite Passchendaele.

=Battle of Malmaison: 23 October – 2 November=

After numerous requests from Haig, Petain launched the Battle of La Malmaison, a long-delayed French attack on the Chemin des Dames, by Maistre's Sixth Army. The artillery preparation started on 17 October, four months late. The Germans were swiftly defeated, losing 

=Second Battle of Passchendaele: 26 October – 10 November=

The British Fifth Army undertook minor operations 20–22 October
The second stage began on 30 October and was intended to complete the previous stage and gain a base for the final assault on Passchendaele.

Aftermath

Analysis

In a German General Staff publication it was written that "Germany had been brought near to certain destruction (

Casualties

Various casualty figures have been published, sometimes with much acrimony, although the highest estimates for British and German casualties appear to be discredited.

Commemoration

The Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing. commemorates those of all Commonwealth nations, except New Zealand, who died in the Ypres Salient and have no known grave. In the case of the United Kingdom only casualties before 16 August 1917 are commemorated on the memorial. United Kingdom and New Zealand servicemen who died after that date are named on the memorial at Tyne Cot Cemetery. There are numerous tributes and memorials all over Australia and New Zealand to ANZAC soldiers who died in the battle, including plaques at the Christchurch and Dunedin railway stations. The Canadian Corps participation in the Second Battle of Passchendaele is commemorated with the Passchendaele Memorial located at the former site of the Crest Farm on the south-west fringe of Passchendaele village. One of the newest monuments to be dedicated to the fighting contribution of a group is the Celtic Cross memorial commemorating the Scottish contributions and efforts in the fighting in Flanders during the Great War. This memorial is located on the Frezenberg Ridge where the Scottish 9th and 15th Divisions, as part of the British Army, fought during the Battle of Passchendaele. The monument was dedicated by the Scottish Parliament's Minister for Europe Linda Fabiani during the late summer of 2007, the 90th anniversary of the battle.
