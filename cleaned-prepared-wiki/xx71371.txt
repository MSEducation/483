[[Eight-thousander]]

The eight-thousanders are the 14 independentIn making any "highest mountains" list, one needs to use a criterion to exclude subpeaks and only list independent mountains. There is no universally agreed-upon such criterion. However the (generally accepted) list of 14 eight-thousanders is obtained if one uses a topographic prominence cutoff of between 200 and 500 metres (610 and 1524 feet). Some eight-thousand metre subpeaks have been climbed as goals in themselves, for example Lhotse Middle, but this is quite rare. mountains on Earth that are more than  high above sea level. All eight-thousanders are located in the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges in Asia.
The first recorded attempt on an eight-thousander was when Albert F. Mummery and J. Norman Collie tried to climb Kashmir's Nanga Parbat (present-day Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan) in 1895. Mummery and two Gurkhas, Ragobir and Goman Singh, were killed by an avalanche, and the attempt failed.
The first recorded successful ascent of an eight-thousander was by Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal, who reached the summit of Annapurna on June 3, 1950.
The first person to climb all 14 eight-thousanders was Reinhold Messner, who completed this task on October 16, 1986. A year later, in 1987, Jerzy Kukuczka became the second climber to accomplish this feat. Messner had summitted each of the 14 peaks without the aid of supplemental oxygen. This feat was not repeated until nine years later by Erhard Loretan in 1995. 
The countries with the highest number of climbers that have climbed all 14 eight-thousanders are Italy and South Korea, with five climbers each, followed by Spain, with four climbers.  Kazakhstan, Poland have three climbers each that completed the "Crown of the Himalaya". The first woman who claimed to have summited all 14 eight-thousanders was Oh Eun-Sun of South Korea, stating she completed the set by summiting Annapurna on April 27, 2010.
In August 2011, Austrian climber Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner became the first woman to climb the 14 eight-thousanders without the use of supplementary oxygen.

Field O2 lists people who have climbed all 14 without bottled oxygen.
* regarding Chhang Dawa Sherpa; Doubts have been raised about his Annapurna ascent. Awaiting further and final confirmation on this.

Disputed

Claims in which not enough evidence was provided to verify the ascents of the 14 peaks.
