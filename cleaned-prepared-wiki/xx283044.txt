Since Brooks had accused the couple of infidelity, a charge that was denied by both and never proven, the divorce decree forbade the two from marrying in New York. They wed in Pennsylvania instead and used a similar case involving a divorced New York judge as precedence for their marriage to be recognized in New York State. Bell again Married.
