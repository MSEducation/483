Paul Warwick (born 8 January 1981 in Australia) is an Australian rugby union player for English team Worcester Warriors, who play their rugby in the Aviva Premiership. He plays as a fly-half, fullback or centre.

Connacht

Warwick joined Irish province Connacht from Manly in 2004 on a one-year contract. A 97-point return in the 2004–05 European Challenge Cup saw Warwick awarded with a two-year extension on his contract. In a total of 19 appearances in the Challenge Cup, he scored 157 points.

Munster

Warwick joined Munster in 2007, straight from Connacht.
As Warwick has played Rugby sevens with the Australia Sevens, he will never be eligible to play for Ireland, despite the fact that he would now qualify through marriage and residency.

Stade Français

He joined Stade Français in 2011 on a two-year contract.

Worcester Warriors

It was announced on 25 January 2013 that Warwick will join Aviva Premiership side Worcester Warriors at the beginning of the 2013–14 season. He made his debut for the club on 5 October 2013, coming off the bench against Newcastle Falcons.
