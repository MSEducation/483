[[Modern Hebrew phonology]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew language, Language phonologies

This article is about the phonology of the Hebrew language based on the Israeli dialects. It deals with current phonology and phonetics as well as with historical developments thereof, including geographical variants.
Hebrew has been used primarily for liturgical, literary, and scholarly purposes for most of the past two millennia. As a consequence, its pronunciation has been strongly influenced by the vernacular of each individual Jewish community. In contrast to the varied development of these pronunciations is the relatively rapid development of modern Israeli Hebrew.
The two main pronunciations of Modern Israeli Hebrew are Oriental and Non-Oriental.

Consonants

Below are the consonants of modern General Israeli Hebrew. Some historically distinctive Hebrew phonemes have merged in modern Hebrew, such as historically distinctive  (ט).  The exact nature of the emphatic feature for emphatic consonants is a matter of debate; the most commonly suggested possibilities are pharyngealization (as in Arabic) and glottalization (as in the Ethiopian Semitic languages).
For these cases, the Academy of the Hebrew Language suggests two transliteration sets, a generic one, reflecting modern phonology, and a strict one, reflecting the orthographic distinctions, which are still in use, and the historical phonology.See transliteration rules set by the Academy of the Hebrew Language

In Israeli Hebrew, , as reflected in the spelling בלוטוס).

Example words

Consonant clusters

In obstruent clusters, a voicing assimilation usually occurs as native Hebrew speakers tend to voice or devoice the first obstruent according to the second one.
Examples:

Dropped consonants

In casual fast speech, .

Vowels

The Hebrew word for vowels is ). The orthographic representations for these vowels are called Niqqud. Israeli Hebrew has 5 vowel phonemes.

Shva

The Hebrew Niqqud sign "Shva" was traditionally classified as representing four grammatical entities: resting (nakh / , where C stands for any consonant).

Stress

Modern Hebrew, like Tiberian Hebrew, has stress: on the last syllable (milra') and on the penultimate syllable (the one preceding the last, mil'el). The former is more frequent. The stress has phonemic value, e.g. "שבו", when pronounced  it means "captured". However, Modern Hebrew, like Tiberian Hebrew, has also stressed words on the antepenult (mil'el demil'el; e.g. נֶ֣עֶרְמוּ מַיִם (Ex. 15:8)) or even further back (קיבוצניקיות)
{see e.g. 
Laufer Asher (2008), Chapters in Phonetics and in Phonetic Transcription, (The book is accompanied with a CD), Magnes, Jerusalem, 2008, pp. 52-55 (in Hebrew).}

Regional and historical variation

The following table contains the pronunciation of the Hebrew letters in reconstructed historical forms and dialects using the International Phonetic Alphabet. The apostrophe-looking symbol after some letters is not a yud but a geresh. It is used for loanwords with non-native Hebrew sounds and only in Israeli Hebrew. The dot in the middle of some of the letters, called a "dagesh kal", also modifies the sounds of the letters ב, כ and פ in modern Hebrew (in earlier forms of Hebrew it used to modify also the sounds of the letters ג, ד and ת; the "dagesh chazak" – orthographically indistinguishable from the "dagesh kal" – designates gemination, which today is realized only rarely – e.g. in biblical recitations or when using Arabic loanwords).
