Several modern dialects of Ukrainian exist

Neighboring countries

All the countries neighboring Ukraine (except for Hungary) historically have regions with a sizable Ukrainian population and therefore Ukrainian language speakers. Ukrainian is an official minority language in some of them.

Ukrainian diaspora

Ukrainian is also spoken by a large émigré population, particularly in Canada (see Canadian Ukrainian), United States, and several countries of South America like Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. The founders of this population primarily emigrated from Galicia, which used to be part of Austro-Hungary before World War I, and belonged to Poland between the World Wars. The language spoken by most of them is the Galician dialect of Ukrainian from the first half of the 20th century. Compared with modern Ukrainian, the vocabulary of Ukrainians outside Ukraine reflects less influence of Russian, but often contains many loan words from the local language.
Most of the countries where it is spoken are ex-USSR, where many Ukrainians have migrated. Canada and the United States are also home to a large Ukrainian population. Broken up by country (to the nearest thousand):
Ukrainian is one of three official languages of the breakaway Moldovan republic of Transnistria.
Ukrainian is widely spoken within the 400,000-strong (in 1994) Ukrainian community in Brazil. Danyil Kozlinsky (1994). Ukrainians in Brazil (Chapter), in Ukraine and Ukrainians Throughout the World, edited by Ann Lencyk Pawliczko, University of Toronto Press: Toronto, pp. 443–454

Language structure

Grammar

The canonical word order of Ukrainian is subject–verb–object (SVO).
Old East Slavic (and Russian) o in closed syllables, that is, ending in a consonant, in many cases corresponds to a Ukrainian i, as in pod > pid (під, 'under'). Thus, in the declension of nouns, the o can re-appear as it is no longer located in a closed syllable, such as rik (рік, 'year') (nom): rotsi (loc) (році).
Ukrainian case endings are somewhat different from Old East Slavic, and the vocabulary includes a large overlay of Polish terminology. Russian na pervom etaže 'on the first floor' is in the locative (prepositional) case. The Ukrainian corresponding expression is na peršomu poversi (на першому поверсі). -omu is the standard locative (prepositional) ending, but variants in -im are common in dialect and poetry, and allowed by the standards bodies. The kh of Ukrainian poverkh (поверх) has mutated into s under the influence of the soft vowel i (k is similarly mutable into c in final positions). Ukrainian is the only modern East Slavic language which preserves the vocative case.

Sounds

The Ukrainian language has six vowels, .
A number of the consonants come in three forms: hard, soft (palatalized) and long, for example, .
The letter  for both English g and h. 
Another phonetic divergence between the Ukrainian and Russian languages is the pronunciation of Cyrillic  for w instead.
Unlike Russian and most other modern Slavic languages, Ukrainian does not have final devoicing. Ukrainians commonly maintain that Ukrainian is softer and more mellifluous than the harsher Russian.

Alphabet

Ukrainian is written in a version of Cyrillic, consisting of 33 letters, representing 38 phonemes; an apostrophe is also used.  Ukrainian orthography is based on the phonemic principle, with one letter generally corresponding to one phoneme, although there are a number of exceptions. The orthography also has cases where the semantic, historical, and morphological principles are applied.
The modern Ukrainian alphabet is the result of a number of proposed alphabetic reforms from the 19th and early 20th centuries, in Ukraine under the Russian Empire, in Austrian Galicia, and later in Soviet Ukraine. A unified Ukrainian alphabet (the Skrypnykivka, after Mykola Skrypnyk) was officially established at a 1927 international Orthographic Conference in Kharkiv, during the period of Ukrainization in Soviet Ukraine.  But the policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the Soviet Ukrainian orthography diverged from that used by the diaspora.  The Ukrainian letter ge ґ was banned in the Soviet Union from 1933 until the period of Glasnost in 1990.
The letter щ represents two consonants  = йи are written using two letters. These iotated vowel letters and a special soft sign change a preceding consonant from hard to soft. An apostrophe is used to indicate the hardness of the sound in the cases when normally the vowel would change the consonant to soft; in other words, it functions like the yer in the Russian alphabet.
A consonant letter is doubled to indicate that the sound is doubled, or long.
The phonemes  is close to g in huge.

The Dictionary of Ukrainian Language in 11 volumes contains 135,000 entries. As mentioned at the top of the article, Ukrainian is most closely related lexically to Belarusian, and is also closer to Polish than to Russian (for example, можливість, "possibility", and Polish możliwość, but Russian возможность).

Classification and relationship to other languages

Being a Slavic language, Ukrainian has a mutual intelligibility with some of them. Within Slavic, the Ukrainian language is considered to be the most closely related to Belarusian. Cubberley. (2006). The Slavic languages . Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pg. 518 Daco-Romanian and Hungarian, though non-Slavic languages, also share a nonnegligible amount of vocabulary with Slavic languages and therefore with Ukrainian too.

In the 19th century the question of whether Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian languages are the dialects of a single language or three separate languages was actively discussed and wasn't entirely decided by linguistic factors alone.  The political situation (Ukraine and Belarus being mainly part of the Russian Empire at the time) and the historical existence of the medieval state of Kievan Rus', which occupied large parts of these three nations, led to the creation of the common classification known later as the East Slavic languages. The underlying theory of the East Slavic group of languages is their descent from  a common ancestor. Nowadays Ukrainian, Russian, and Belarusian are usually listed by linguists as separate languages. Corbett, ed.  1993.  The Slavonic Languages (Routledge). Ethnologue, 16th edition. Bernard Comrie.  1992.  "Slavic Languages," International Encyclopedia of Linguistics (Oxford).  Vol. 3, pp. 452–456. 1999/2000.

Until the 17th and 18th centuries (the time of national and language revival of Ukraine) the Ukrainians were predominantly peasants and petits bourgeois; as a result, the Ukrainian language was mostly vernacular and few earlier literary works from the period can be found. In the cities Ukrainian coexisted with Church Slavonic, a literary language of religion that evolved from the Old Slavonic, and later Polish and Russian, both languages which were more often used in formal writing and communication during that time.

Differences between Ukrainian and other Slavic languages

The Ukrainian language has the following similarities and differences with other Slavic languages:
Unlike all other Slavic languages, only Ukrainian has a synthetic future (also termed inflectional future) tense which developed through the erosion and cliticization of the verb 'to have' (or possibly 'to take'): pysa-ty-mu (infinitive-future-1st sg.) I will write. The Languages and Linguistics of Europe: A Comprehensive Guide, Volume 2. p. 103 The inflectional future (based on the verb ´to have´) is characteristic for Romance languages. Nevertheless, Ukrainian linguist A. Danylenko purports that grammaticalization of the Ukrainian inflectional (synthetic) future is different from the Romance one arguing that the typological difference lies in the choice of auxiliary which should be interpreted as ´to take' and not ´to have´. Danylenko refers to the Common Slavic period. The point is that Common Slavic had three verbs having the same root *em-, a determined imperfective LCS *jęti : *jĭmǫ 'to take',later superseded by numerous prefixed perfectives, an in determined im-perfective LCS *jĭmati : jemljǫ 'to take' which would not take any pre-fixes, and finally, an imperfective LCS *jĭměti : *jĭmamĭ 'to hold, own, have'. These three verbs came historically confused in East Slavic due to the morphonological overlapping, in particular of iměti 'to have' and jati 'to take' as exemplified in the Middle Ukrainian homonymic imut' from both iměti ( future is also found in Chinese and Hungarian.
