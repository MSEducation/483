Spanair S.A. was a Spanish airline, with its head office in the Spanair Building in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, near Barcelona.  It was, until 2009 a subsidiary of the SAS Group; the same parent company in control of Scandinavian Airlines and held slightly under 20% of the company. Spanair was a Star Alliance member from 2003 until its demise.

History

The airline was established in December 1986 and began operations in March 1988.  It was set up as a joint venture between Scandinavian Airlines and Viajes Marsans, and began operations with European charters.  Long-haul flights to the United States, Mexico and the Dominican Republic were launched in 1991, followed by domestic scheduled flights in March 1994.  The airline flew long-haul flights with Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to Washington and Buenos Aires in the late 1990s. Spanair joined Star Alliance on 1 May 2003.Spanair Star Alliance information
The company was 94% owned by the SAS Group. The divestment was cancelled on 19 June 2008 due to SAS not being able to sell for a price that it considered to "reflect the underlying value in Spanair."  On 30 January 2009, however, a one euro bid from group of investors from Catalonia, led by the Consorci de Turisme de Barcelona and Catalana d'Inciatives, was later accepted, whereupon SAS became a minority shareholder.
A report in The Times on the day of the Madrid crash suggests that staff were threatening strike action due to concerns about the company's viability.
