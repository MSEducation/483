[[Kinsey scale]]

CATEGORIES: Sexual orientation, Sexology, Scales, Bisexuality, 1948 introductions

The Kinsey scale, also called the Heterosexualâ€“Homosexual Rating Scale, The reports were first published in Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) by Alfred Kinsey, Wardell Pomeroy and others, and were also prominent in the complementary work Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953).



Introducing the scale, Kinsey wrote:

Today, many sexologists see the Kinsey scale as relevant to sexual orientation but not comprehensive enough to cover all sexual identity issues. They suggest that sexual identity involves at least three different spectra, sexual orientation being only one of them (two others being biological sex and gender identity).
There have been similar studies where the scale is from 0 to 10. In such studies, the person would be asked a question such as "If 0 is completely gay and 10 is completely hetero, what is your orientation number?".Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity (2006) - Janbell L Caroll

Table of the scale

The Kinsey scale ranges from 0, for those who would identify themselves as exclusively heterosexual with no experience with or desire for sexual activity with their same sex, to 6, for those who would identify themselves as exclusively homosexual with no experience with or desire for sexual activity with those of the opposite sex, and 1-5 for those who would identify themselves with varying levels of desire for sexual activity with either sex, including "incidental" or "occasional" desire for sexual activity with the same sex.

Alternate measures of sexual orientation

The Kinsey Scale does not address all possible sexual expressions.  Others have stepped forward to define it further. In 1980, Michael Storms proposed a two dimensional chart with an X and Y axis.
Kinsey, Storm, and Klein are only three of more than 200 scales to measure and describe sexual orientation.
