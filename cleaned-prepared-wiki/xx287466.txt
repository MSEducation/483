Writing in The Independent, Christopher Hirst called the book "an enjoyable exploration of pop nomenclature", while Andrew Coleman reported in the Birmingham Mail that Beech's interest in names, before the age of Internet research, "stemmed from an interview with Sting, real name Gordon Sumner who once wore a striped black and yellow jumper which made him look like a wasp."
