Blountsville is a town in Blount County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 1,684.
Blount County was created by the Alabama territorial legislature on February 6, 1818, from land ceded to the federal government by the Creek Nation on August 9, 1814. It was named for Gov. Willie G. Blount of Tennessee, who provided assistance to settlers in Alabama during the Creek War of 1813-14. It lies in the northeastern section of the state, generally known as the mineral region.

History

What became Blountsville appears on an 1819 map as the mixed Creek/Cherokee Indian village of "Wassausey" (meaning Bear Meat Cabin, the name of an Indian translator who lived there). The town was established by Caleb Fryley and Johnny Jones in 1816 as Bear Meat Cabin. The post office was opened as Blountsville on October 20, 1825, and incorporated on December 13, 1827. It was the county seat until 1889 when the government was moved to Oneonta.
There were many schools in the town in the early years: The Academy, Blount College and the District Agricultural School, plus the public schools. The Blount County Courthouse and jail was built in 1833 and remained there until it was moved to Oneonta. A major crossroads in early Alabama, Blountsville became a Confederate depot for the cavalry. Confederate forces led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest and Union forces led by General Abel Streight skirmished briefly in the town on May 1, 1863, and Major General Lovell H. Rousseau and his Union cavalry occupied the town in July 1864. Blount College was in the building that was originally the courthouse. It was established in 1890. The beautiful Blountsville United Methodist Church was established in 1818 and is still in use today.
The oldest building in Blountsville was once known as the Barclift House.  Built in 1834 as Hendricks Tavern, it is now owned and is being restored by the Ortiz family.

Attractions

The Copeland-Bussey House, built c. 1835, is one of the oldest structures in northeast Alabama. The building has been stabilized by the Alabama Historic Preservation Alliance and the Blountsville Historical Society.
The Freeman House, built circa 1825, was damaged by a storm, and the two-story brick dwelling was rebuilt, using the same bricks, into a one story. The porches face the historic Meat Cabin Road, and the other porch faces U.S. Highway 231. An annual reenactment is held on the grounds. The structure has been renovated by the Blountsville Historical Society and now serves as a museum and visitors' center on a part-time basis. During the reenactment it is furnished with period furnishings and is open to the public for tours.
The Thomas Nation House, circa 1835, is now a ruin due to a storm that took all but one and one half walls down in 1998 before the house could be stabilized. The ruins can still be seen from U.S. Highway 231.
Blountsville is also home to the Spring Valley Beach Water Park, one of the few water parks in the lower Sand Mountain area. Spring Valley Beach contains one of the largest swimming pools in the South and seven water slides.  It is also home to the 360 Rush water slide, the only one of its kind in the world.
