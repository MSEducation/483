Then he meets Nazneen Ahmed, the young daughter of Manzur Ahmed, and he forgets this rule and falls in love with her.
Police on both sides of the border are aware of the illegal refugee traffic and the Indian police regularly questions Refugee and his old father Jan Muhammad.

Shortly thereafter, explosions take place in trains, buses, and buildings in the Indian capital.
