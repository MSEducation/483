Interstate 39 (I-39) is a highway in the midwestern United States. I-39 runs from Normal, Illinois at I-55 to Wisconsin Highway 29 (WIS 29) in Rib Mountain, Wisconsin, approximately  I-39 was designed to replace US Highway 51 (US 51), which in the early 1980s was one of the busiest two-lane highways in the United States.  I-39 was built in the 1980s and 1990s.
In Illinois, the route has a total length of  in length, this concurrency of three Interstates is the longest in the country. From Portage northward, US 51 is co-signed with the Interstate and has its exits based on its mileage.

Route description

Illinois

In Illinois, I-39 begins from Interstate 55 north of the Bloomington-Normal, Illinois, area alongside of Route 251. It runs north largely through rural areas from the city of Normal. About  Just north of the Illinois River, I-39 runs east of the cities of LaSalle and Peru before intersecting Interstate 80. North of I-80, the wind turbines of the Mendota Hills Wind Farm can be seen from milepost 72 at Mendota north to near Paw Paw. Further north I-39 runs along the south and east sides of Rockford, concurrent with U.S. 20.  The interstate joins the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway and Interstate 90 near Cherry Valley, during which there is a toll booth in South Beloit. U.S. 51 leaves I-39/90 in South Beloit, while I-39/90 continue north into Wisconsin.
For all but  from Interstate 74 as it runs around Normal.

Wisconsin

I-39 enters from Illinois along with I-90, passing under Stateline road, and bypasses Beloit to the east. East of the town, the route has a cloverleaf interchange that serves as the terminus for both WIS 81—which heads westward into Beloit—and I-43, which provides access to Milwaukee. The I-39/90 concurrency continues to the north and is joined by WIS 11 about 7 mi (11 km) north of the I-43 interchange. The route bypasses Janesville to the east, although interchanges with US 14 (where WIS 81 leaves the concurrency) and WIS 26 provide access to the town. The route continues generally to the north, crossing the Rock River before having an interchange with WIS 59 that provides access to Edgerton to the west.
The Interstates cross WIS 60 at an interchange three miles (5 km) north of the county line west of Arlington and CTH CS at another interchange four miles (6 km) further north near Poynette.  The highway crosses the Wisconsin River four miles (6 km) north of CTH CS.  At three miles (5 km) further along the route from the river, I-39 leaves the concurrency with I-90 and I-94 and turns northward while the other two interstates turn northwest.  WIS 78 terminates at this interchange and heads southwest.  This is the starting point of the segment of freeway that carries the I-39 route alone.  The interstate crosses WIS 33, the first of three interchanges accessing Portage, two miles (3 km) north of I-90/I-94.    After crossing the Wisconsin River again, I-39 crosses the second interchange—this one with WIS 16 and turns northeast to an interchange with US 51.  The US route joins the Interstate and both turn north once again and leave the Portage area and, after four miles (6 km), enter Marquette County.
WIS 23 joins I-39/US 51 northbound, 4 miles (6 km) from the county line.  The three highways pass along Buffalo Lake and encounter a south-side half interchange with CTH D in the town of Packwaukee.  WIS 23 leave the concurrency to the east at WIS 82 near Oxford. and the freeway takes a due north route to pass Westfield. I-39/US 51 enters Waushara County six miles (10 km) north of Westfield.
WIS 34 terminates at an interchange with I-39/US 51 in Knowlton three miles (5 km) northwest of the freeway's entry into Marathon County.  The freeway turns due north from this interchange. WIS 153 crosses the freeway four miles further north in Mosinee.  Maple Ridge Road crosses after another two miles (3 km) as the freeway turns northeastward into Kronenwetter.

History

The genesis of Interstate 39 dates back to 1945, when the United States began planning the first 40,000 mile interstate system. An initial request was made for a north-south highway from South Beloit to Salem, Illinois. and in 1956, legislation provided funding for the highway. However, the project was deemed a low priorty and was shelved. Nonetheless, a portion of the present-day Interstate 39 was built as part of the Northwest Tollway (now Jane Addams Memorial Tollway) in 1958. In 1963, the U.S 20 Rockford bypass was constructed. U.S 51, which ran mostly down the middle of the state, became a heavily traveled two-lane arterial road.
In the late 1960s and early 1970's, a major supplemental freeway system plan was proposed, with the goal of providing Illinois residents access to freeways within 30 minutes or less. One of the proposed routes, FAP 412, was a route that would extend from the U.S 20 Rockford Bypass to Interstate 57 between Salem and Alma, Illinois. However, only the portion between Rockford and Decatur was prioritized.
Construction on the FAP 412 freeway began in 1979. I-39 was first established in 1984 on the section from Illinois Route 5 (now Interstate 88) in Rochelle, to U.S. Route 20 in Rockford.
However, the proposed extension of I-39 between Bloomington-Normal and Decatur was never completed, due to local opposition and lack of funding. U.S 51 between Bloomington and Decatur was instead upgraded to an expressway, with mostly at-grade intersections.
In Wisconsin, the route was officially designated in 1992. The designation of I-39 violated Wisconsin's rule of not having any state trunkline number duplicated—Interstate, U.S. or state—as WIS 39 already existed.
Interstate 39 was considered at one point for the unbuilt Peoria-to-Chicago Highway.

Future

As of October 2007, the Illinois Department of Transportation is in the preliminary design stages for a project involving reconstruction of I-39 from US 20 east to Harrison Avenue in Rockford. The goal of the project is to reconstruct ramps to modern-day standards, and allow southbound I-39 traffic to use through lanes at the US 20 interchange. Currently, southbound I-39 traffic must exit from the US 20 freeway on a single lane ramp.
