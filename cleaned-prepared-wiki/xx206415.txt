History

Frederick High School was established in 1891 at Koontz Hall on 156 North Market Street, and known then as the Male High School.  The 
first graduating class had only one member.  By 1912, a new school was built near Frederick Memorial Hospital on Park Avenue (the school formerly known as Elm Street) and became known as Boys' High School.  Tuition was charged for the students attending school 
during the last decade of the nineteenth century at a cost of $2.50 for the first year, $3.00 for the second year and $4.00 for the third year.  At this time a student was required to complete only three years of high school to graduate.  The story of high school education for girls in 
Frederick was very similar. The Girls' School was housed from 1889 to 1922 in the large brick building on East Church Street that recently housed the offices of the Board of Education.  When co-education was introduced in 1922 the Elm Street building was greatly enlarged and 
became known as Frederick High School. In the spring of 1940, commencement was held for the first time in the present school building, located on a large campus in the western section of town.  In the fall of 1957, ninth grade students became part of a junior high school housed at Elm Street, and FHS then became a senior high school only.  In 1957 a new vocational agriculture building with its farm shop and greenhouse was completed.  The football field, track and other improvements were completed in 1959. Beginning in 1977 a major renovation project completely refurbished the existing building and more than doubled the square footage. Students who were temporarily moved to the West Frederick Junior High School returned to a new building in 1981 with a dedication ceremony held in November, after the final work on the gym,pool and auditorium had been completed. 

Building and School Replacement

The school is located at 650 Carroll Parkway in historic downtown Frederick City.  It is just north of Maryland Route 144, east of U.S. 15, south of West 2nd Street, and east of West College Terrace. Frederick High School was initially constructed in 1939 with additions in 1955, 1967, 1977 and 1980. Approximately one third of the building was renovated in 1977. While a few systemic improvements have been made to the school such as roof repairs, no other significant renovations have occurred in this building in almost 35 years.

In the summer of 2012 a feasibility study was begun to explore options to renovate FHS.  The Board of Education unanimously voted to allow students to remain in the current 1939 building while constructing a new school on the Frederick campus. The first step in the modernization of Frederick High was to perform a feasibility study. The purpose of the feasibility study was to identify school facility renovation/modernization needs and the cost of meeting those needs.  The study was completed in December 2012 and in February 2013, the Board of Education approved Option Number 5 to construct a new facility on the existing site that will be located on the existing parking lot to the west of the existing building.  Students will remain in the current building while the new building is constructed. Option 5 received approval from the Designees of the Interagency Committee on School Construction in February 2013. 
Assuming that funding is available, it is anticipated that the project will go to bid in the spring of 2015 with construction starting in July 2015.  The new school is expected to open in the fall 2017.  Demolition of the old building and final site work will follow, with project completion by fall 2018.
