Terry L. Martin (born October 10, 1980) is an American mixed martial artist from Chicago, Illinois. He holds notable wins over Jorge Rivera, Ivan Salaverry, and Chael Sonnen.
Martin made his professional boxing debut on April 12, 2008, Fiveouncesofpain. and defeated Ricardo Upchurch by knockout in 40 seconds. On November 21, 2012 Martin suffered his first loss as professional boxer when he was TKOed in the third round by Dimar Ortuz.

Early life

Martin grew up on the west side of Chicago, Illinois. Joining a street gang by the age of 10, Martin was nearly killed at the age of 15 in the summer of 1996, when he was caught in a drive-by shooting and hit by five bullets in his legs, chest and back.  After recuperating, Martin turned his back on gang life and focused on his education, becoming the first member of his immediate family to earn his high-school diploma.  Since graduating from high school, Martin has additionally attained a Bachelor of Science degree, a Master's Degree, and he is currently enrolled at the Adler School of Psychology's Chicago campus as a doctoral candidate.  Martin has also begun to use the fame that mixed martial arts has given him to speak to inner-city children about his life and accomplishments, urging them to stay in school.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=ArTqsLUTCKrvmXMAVRxsWQE9Eo14?slug=mmajunkie-Terry_Martin_bounce_back&prov=mmajunkie&type=lgns
