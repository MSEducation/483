San Fernando High School is a secondary school that is a part of the Los Angeles Unified School District. It is located in the Pacoima area of Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley region, near the City of San Fernando."Auditorium to Be Named for Chavez." Los Angeles Times. June 10, 2000.
The school colors are black and gold. All female teams are referred to as "Lady Tigers"; all male teams simply as the "Tigers". It is the only high school in California with Project G.R.A.D.(Graduation Really Achieves Dreams). San Fernando High School also hosts the Puente Project, a national-award winning program which has claimed to have assisted thousands of students in reaching their dreams of college success.
The City of San Fernando is zoned to the school. Originally more of the Pacoima area was assigned to the school, but much of it was reassigned to Arleta High School when that school opened in 2006. The San Fernando Gardens public housing complex in Pacoima is assigned to San Fernando High School.
Plans to bring the school to a traditional calendar in 2009, rather than the "year-round" calendar, have surfaced recently. With the opening of numerous new senior high schools in the San Fernando Valley relieving overpopulation in area schools, the plan has been described as being possible. Apparently, that was obvious to officials as well, because in March 2008 it was announced by current school principal Ken Lee that San Fernando High School would start on a traditional calendar in fall of that year. This calendar would allow all three tracks (A, B, and C-track; roughly 3300 students in total) to join as one in September 2008, as well as make it impossible for the city's planned charter middle school to take residence within the school grounds.
