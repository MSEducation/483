Minnesota Thunder was an American professional soccer team based in Minnesota, United States. Founded in 1990, the team played in the USL First Division (USL-1), the second tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, until 2009. The team played its home games at the National Sports Center in nearby Blaine, Minnesota for its final two seasons. The team's colors were navy blue, light blue, silver, and white.
The team had a development team, Rochester Thunder, which independently played in USL Premier Development League for another season after the Thunder folded, and a sister organization, the Minnesota Lightning, which played in the women's USL W-League.

History

Before the Thunder

Prior to the Minnesota Thunder forming in 1990 Minnesota had two former professional soccer teams. After two seasons as the Denver Dynamos the franchise was purchased by Minnesota investors and became the Minnesota Kicks. The Minnesota Kicks played the state's first professional soccer game in May 1976 to a crowd of over twenty thousand at Metropolitan Stadium. The team survived for six season competing in the North American Soccer League before folding after the 1981 season.

Independent era (1990–1993)

The team was founded as an all star team in 1990. The team was composed of top amateur and former professional players who were mostly in their late 20s or early 30s. Add in Buzz Lagos' two boys, Gerald and Manuel, and Wisconsin's John Menk, and Peterson, again, is well down the totem pole. The team scheduled five exhibition games against teams in the American Pro Soccer League. At the time the goal was to eventually get a semipro soccer team for the Twin Cities.Hallman, Charley (June 23, 1990) "NO JOB IS TOO HIGH A RISK FOR PETERSON" Saint Paul Pioneer Press
The Thunder operated on a budget of $35,000 dollars in their first year paying no salaries. The budget mainly supported stadium rental at the National Sports Center, office rental and promotions. In the first season the team played against the amateur Madison 56ers, professional San Francisco Bay Blackhawks and Winnipeg Fury and the indoor professional Chicago Power and Milwaukee Wave. Attendance averaged around 1,000 fans a game. Engstrom and Lagos would like to see their team included in a Midwest amateur divisional format by next summer. Within a couple of years, they envision the Thunder playing in a third division of the APSL. "We'll have to see what happens," Engstrom said. "We're just trying to go at this in a responsible manner."
In the first season the team lost around $12,000. The next year, 1991, with the help of corporate sponsors Rainbow Foods, Kemps, and Liberty State Bank, the team played an expanded schedule with a record of eight victories and three ties losing $10,000 in the process. The following year the team added four more corporate sponsors and expected to lose about $5,000 with a budget of $45,000 By their third season the team became a model for teams in Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison, and Canada due to their competitive schedule, reasonable budget and fan base. The team was undefeated through their first twenty games. (July 30, 1992) "Thunder storms past foes - Soccer team's players in it only for love of game" Star Tribune

Buzz Lagos era (1994–2005)

On November 13, 1993 the Thunder announced its intention to join the U.S. Interregional Soccer League. The team joined the Midwest Region and retained their amateur status for the 1994 season.Leighton, Time (August 17, 1994 )"THUNDER AIM FOR BIG TIME//INVESTORS NEEDED FOR MAJOR STEP UP" Saint Paul Pioneer Press The team became professional for the 1995 season.Zgoda, Jerry (April 19, 1995) "Thunder hits higher level - USISL champs to compete in 50-team pro league" Star Tribune"THUNDER WILL OPEN FIRST PRO SEASON IN FLORIDA" (January 14, 1995) Saint Paul Pioneer Press
On July 15, 2004 coach Buzz Lagos earned his 300th victory. It was his 123rd since the Thunder joined the A-League in 1997."LAGOS EARNS 300TH VICTORY AS THUNDER WIN AT HOME" (July 16, 2004) Saint Paul Pioneer Press Five days later Lagos led the Thunder to their first victory over a MLS team in a nonexhibtion game. The Thunder defeated the Los Angeles Galaxy in fourth round U.S. Open Cup game played to 5,505 fans at the Metrodome. 
The 2005 season brought many changes to the Thunder. The Thunder's A-League and the lower Pro Soccer League were reorganized. The Thunder were placed in the twelve team First Division which previously had sixteen teams."THUNDER TO PLAY IN USL'S TOP DIVISION" (November 11, 2004)Saint Paul Pioneer PressRand, Michael (November 11, 2004) "Thunder's league is reorganized" Star Tribune Additionally, the team was sold to an ownership led by majority owner Saeed Kadkhodaian.  These changes led to Buzz Lagos announcing on August 1, 2005 that he would retire as coach after sixteen season. Lagos cited wanting to spend more time with his family as the main reason to retiring.

The Thunder defeated four MLS teams over the course of the 2004 and 2005 U.S. Open Cup competitions.

Final Years (2005–2009)

Beginning in August 2007 the team spent $400,000 on a beer garden called the Thunder Lounge and started the Minnesota Thunder Academy. The team also founded the Rochester Thunder in the Premier Development League. "Thunder weathering storm of cash-flow concerns" . Star Tribune
In November 2009 the Thunder announced their intent to leave the USL First Division to become the co-founders of a new North American Soccer League. 
Minnesota's participation in this new league was, however, not to be. In early November 2009 they released all players from their contracts, partly in response to heavy debts and unpaid bills, including wages. The organization was operating with a skeleton staff of 3 people as they tried to reorganize in their final days.
In January 2010, the National Sports Center announced the formation of a new club, the NSC Minnesota Stars that functions as a replacement for the Thunder.insidemnsoccer.com/2010/01/07/national-sports-center-announces-new-professional-soccer-team/

Colors and badge

A new logo using the colors of navy blue, light blue, and silver was unveiled for the 2008 season. The identity was designed by the Minneapolis design firm Capsule.
The previous Thunder badge incorporated the logo of a capital 'T' and an active soccer ball on a shield reading "Minnesota Thunder".  When on the team uniform, it also is adorned atop by a gold star commemorating the 1999 championship season.
The initial Thunder crest was a soccer ball with a thunderbolt crossing it followed by the text "Minnesota Thunder."
When the team became a professional organization, a new logo was created, consisting of an image of the state of Minnesota background with a soccer ball and thunderbolt imposed upon it.
In 2002, the Thunder undertook a marketing re-branding endeavor, where a new logo was created consisting of a soccer ball with movement lines and a T below the words of team's name.
In 2006, a new navy and gold "shield" logo was created by the Minneapolis design firm CAPSULE.
The official mascot of the Minnesota Thunder was Thor.Leighton, Tim (April 16, 1995) "THUNDER TURN AGGRESSIVE OFF FIELD, TOO" Saint Paul Pioneer Press

Stadiums

The Thunder's first home field was the National Sports Center in Blaine, Minnesota where they played until 2003. In 2003 the Thunder wanted to reduce the number of home games played at the National Sports Center to seven. The Minnesota Amateur Sports Commission which owns the National Sports Center was not comfortable with the idea so the Thunder decided to look elsewhere. Their three year lease expired in 2003 leaving them open to search for other facilities for 2004. At the time revenue from the Thunder accounted for less than one percent of the National Sports Center's total revenue. Barclay Kruse, the associate director of the Minnesota Amateur Sports Commission described the situation as, "The best way to describe it is that we're disappointed."
In 2004 the Thunder played home matches at James Griffin Stadium, also known as "The Jimmy", in St Paul. The move to this stadium in central Saint Paul was made in an attempt to reduce overhead costs and market to a more urban and ethnic crowd. According to then president and general manager Jim Froslid some of the deciding were being on a bus line (mass transit does not go to Blaine) and being accessible to the ethnic community. ``When we were in Blaine, we would receive a minimum of five calls a game from a person with a Latino accent asking, what bus line do they take to get to Blaine? Our reluctant reply was always: `The bus does not go to Blaine.' 
Fan surveys indicated that they would attend more games if the Thunder played in a more central location. Sports Illustrated.  Retrieved on July 1, 2009
On May 12, 2008, they returned to the National Sports Center with a lease until 2011. At the time the Thunder was the only team in the USL to not play in a soccer specific stadium and the only team that played on with painted American football lines. (May 12, 2008) "Thunder bolting St. Paul, returning to former home in Blaine immediately."Star Tribune. Retrieved on July 1, 2009
The Metrodome was occasionally used as a home field.  Macalester Stadium at Macalester College in St. Paul was also used for games in the past. While playing at the National Sports Center the Thunder traditionally played several games a year in other locations notably Macalester College or Eastview High School in Apple Valley.Rand, Michael (September 5, 2003) "Thunder seeks new home field - Team ending relationship with NSC" Star Tribune

Supporters

There was a group of active fans loosely grouped under the name The Dark Clouds. The supporters would typically tailgate before the game and during halftime, sit behind the opposing bench during games, stand and chant throughout the game, and occasionally travel with the team on road games. For the 2009 season an additional supporters section was added in the North End of the stadium adjacent to the new beergarden. This section was dubbed, "Stand Du Nord" and is home to additional supporters groups including, The Dale Weiler Fan Club, and The Damagers.
