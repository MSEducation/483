Cleanthes (, Kleanthēs; c. 330 BC – c. 230 BC), of Assos, was a Greek Stoic philosopher and the successor to Zeno as the second head (scholarch) of the Stoic school in Athens. Originally a boxer, he came to Athens where he took up philosophy, listening to Zeno's lectures. He supported himself by working as water-carrier at night. After the death of Zeno, c. 262 BC, he became the head of the school, a post he held for the next 32 years. Cleanthes successfully preserved and developed Zeno's doctrines. He originated new ideas in Stoic physics, and developed Stoicism in accordance with the principles of materialism and pantheism. Among the fragments of Cleanthes' writings which have come down to us, the largest is a Hymn to Zeus. His pupil was Chrysippus who became one of the most important Stoic thinkers.

Life

Cleanthes was born in Assos in the Troad about 330 BC. Pseudo-Lucian, Valerius Maximus, and Censorinus say that Cleanthes lived to the age of 99 (although Diogenes Laërtius says he died at the age of 80.)  For more information see Tiziano Dorandi, Chapter 2: Chronology, in Algra et al. (1999) The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy, page 38. Cambridge. Dorandi prefers an age of 101. According to Diogenes Laërtius,Diogenes Laërtius, The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, vii. he was the son of Phanias, and early in life he was a boxer.  With but four drachmae in his possession he came to Athens, where he took up philosophy, listening first to the lectures of Crates the Cynic,Suda, Cleanthes and then to those of Zeno, the Stoic. In order to support himself, he worked all night as water-carrier to a gardener (hence his nickname the Well-Water-Collector, ).  As he spent the whole day in studying philosophy with no visible means of support, he was summoned before the Areopagus to account for his way of living. The judges were so delighted by the evidence of work which he produced, that they voted him ten minae, though Zeno would not permit him to accept them. His power of patient endurance, or perhaps his slowness, earned him the title of "the Ass" from his fellow students, a name which he was said to have rejoiced in, as it implied that his back was strong enough to bear whatever Zeno put upon it.
Such was the esteem awakened by his high moral qualities that, on the death of Zeno in 262, he became the leader of the school. He continued, however, to support himself by the labour of his own hands. Among his pupils were his successor, Chrysippus, and Antigonus II Gonatas, from whom he accepted 3000 minae. He died at the age of 99, c. 230 BC. We are told that a dangerous ulcer had compelled him to fast for a time. Subsequently he continued his abstinence, saying that, as he was already half-way on the road to death, he would not trouble to retrace his steps.
Simplicius, writing in the 6th century AD, mentions that a statue of Cleanthes was still visible at Assos, which had been erected by the Roman Senate.

Philosophy

Cleanthes was an important figure in the development of Stoicism, and stamped his personality on the physical speculations of the school, and by his materialism gave a unity to the Stoic system.
He wrote some fifty works, of which only fragments have survived preserved by writers such as Diogenes Laërtius, Stobaeus, Cicero, Seneca and Plutarch.

Physics

Cleanthes revolutionized Stoic physics by the theory of tension (tonos) which distinguished Stoic materialism from all conception of matter as dead and inert. Cleanthes also taught that souls live on after death, but that the intensity of its existence would vary according to the strength or weakness of the particular soul. Phil. iv. 7.
Cleanthes regarded the Sun as being divine;Cicero, De Natura Deorum, ii. 15. because the Sun sustains all living things, it resembled the divine fire which (in Stoic physics) animated all living beings, hence it too must be part of the vivifying fire or aether of the universe. He accused Aristarchus of impiety for daring to put into motion "the hearth of the universe" (i.e. the Earth). Ellery. (1976).....T.W. Rolleston, unavailable, August, 2010 which has been preserved in Stobaeus, in which he declares praise and honour of Zeus to be the highest privilege of all rational beings.

Ethics

Cleanthes maintained that pleasure is not only not a good, but is "contrary to nature" and "worthless."
Zeno had said that the goal of life was "to live consistently," the implication being that no life but the passionless life of reason could ultimately be consistent with itself. Cleanthes is credited with having added the words "with nature," thus completing the well-known Stoic formula that the goal is "to live consistently with nature." This, according to him, is true freedom of will not acting without motive, or apart from set purpose, or capriciously, but humbly acquiescing in the universal order, and, therefore, in everything that befalls one. The direction to follow Universal Nature can be traced in his famous prayer:
 Lead me, Zeus, and you too, Destiny, 
 To wherever your decrees have assigned me. 
I follow readily, but if I choose not, 
Wretched though I am, I must follow still. 
Fate guides the willing, but drags the unwilling. The fifth line is not found in Epictetus.

Modern influence

José Enrique Rodó tells us in his famous essay Ariel that Cleanthes, while performing his night work, sculpted in rocks teachings from Zeno. In this book, Cleanthes is depicted as an inspirational symbol of double activity, utilitarian/material and profound/transcendent too.
