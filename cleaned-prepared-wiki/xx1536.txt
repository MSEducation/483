The Boeing C-17 Globemaster III is a large military transport aircraft.  It was developed for the United States Air Force (USAF) from the 1980s to the early 1990s by McDonnell Douglas. The C-17 carries forward the name of two previous piston-engined military cargo aircraft, the Douglas C-74 Globemaster and the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II. The C-17 commonly performs strategic airlift missions, transporting troops and cargo throughout the world; additional roles include tactical airlift, medical evacuation and airdrop duties.
Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in the 1990s, continues to manufacture C-17s for export customers following the end of deliveries to the U.S. Air Force. The C-17 is operated by the U.S. Air Force, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, NATO Heavy Airlift Wing, India, and Kuwait.

Development

Background and design phase

In the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force began looking for a replacement for its Lockheed C-130 Hercules tactical cargo aircraft."Air Force Lets Advanced STOL Prototype Work." Wall Street Journal, 13 November 1972.  The Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) competition was held, with Boeing proposing the YC-14, and McDonnell Douglas proposing the YC-15. "McDonnell, Boeing to Compete for Lockheed C-130 Successor." Los Angeles Times, 11 November 1972.  Though both entrants exceeded specified requirements, the AMST competition was canceled before a winner was selected. The Air Force started the C-X program in November 1979 to develop a larger AMST with longer range to augment its strategic airlift. 3–20, 24.
By 1980, the USAF found itself with a large fleet of aging C-141 Starlifter cargo aircraft. Compounding matters, USAF needed increased strategic airlift capabilities to fulfill its rapid-deployment airlift requirements. The USAF set mission requirements and released a request for proposals (RFP) for C-X in October 1980. McDonnell Douglas elected to develop a new aircraft based on the YC-15; Boeing bid an enlarged three-engine version of its AMST YC-14. Lockheed submitted two designs, a C-5-based design and an enlarged C-141 design. On 28 August 1981, McDonnell Douglas was chosen to build its proposed aircraft, then designated C-17. Compared to the YC-15, the new aircraft differed in having swept wings, increased size, and more powerful engines. 12–13.  This would allow it to perform the work done by the C-141, and also fulfill some of the duties of the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, freeing the C-5 fleet for outsize cargo.
Alternate proposals were pursued to fill airlift needs after the C-X contest.  These were lengthening of C-141As into C-141Bs, ordering more C-5s, continued purchases of KC-10s, and expansion of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.  Limited budgets reduced program funding, requiring a delay of four years.  During this time contracts were awarded for preliminary design work and for the completion of engine certification.  In December 1985, a full-scale development contract was awarded."Douglas Wins $3.4B Pact to Build C-17." Los Angeles Times, 3 January 1986.  At this time, first flight was planned for 1990. 13, 15.  The Air Force had formed a requirement for 210 aircraft. 70, 81–83.
Development problems and limited funding caused delays in the late 1980s. "Historical Realities of C-17 Program Pose Challenge for Future Acquisitions." Institute for Defense Analyses, December 1999.  Criticisms were made of the developing aircraft and questions were raised about more cost-effective alternatives during this time. "More load for the buck with C-17." Chicago Tribune, 9 September 1989. "McDonnell Plugs Away on C-17." St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 3 April 1989.  In April 1990, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reduced the order from 210 to 120 aircraft. "Cheney cuts back on Air Force programs." Bryan Times, 26 April 1990.  The maiden flight of the C-17 took place on 15 September 1991 from the McDonnell Douglas's plant in Long Beach, California, about a year behind schedule."C-17's First Flight Smoother Than Debate." The New York Times, 17 September 1991. The first aircraft (T-1) and five more production models (P1-P5) participated in extensive flight testing and evaluation at Edwards Air Force Base."RL30685, Military Airlift: C-17 Aircraft Program." Congressional Research Service, 5 June 2007.  Two complete airframes were built for static and repeated load testing. 25–26, 28.

Development difficulties

A static test of the C-17 wing in October 1992 resulted in the wing failing at 128% of design limit load, which was below the 150% requirement.  Both wings buckled rear to the front and failures occurred in stringers, spars and ribs."Technical Assessment Report; C-17 Wing Structural Integrity." Department of Defense, 24 August 1993. Retrieved: 23 August 2011. Some $100 million was spent to redesign the wing structure; the wing failed at 145% during a second test in September 1993."C-17 Wing Fails Again; Probe Is Sought." Seattle Times, 14 September 1993.  Retrieved: 23 August 2011.  A careful review of the test data however, showed that the wing was not loaded correctly and did indeed meet the requirement."Findings, Conclusions and Recommendations of the Executive Independent Review Team." US Government Executive Independent Review Team via blackvault. Retrieved: 23 August 2011.  The C-17 received the "Globemaster III" name in early 1993. In late 1993, the Department of Defense gave the contractor two years to solve production and cost overrun problems or face termination of the contract after the delivery of the 40th aircraft. "Pentagon to Air Force: C-17 flunks." Chicago Tribune, 29 March 1993.  By accepting the 1993 terms, McDonnell Douglas incurred a loss of nearly US$1.5 billion on the development phase of the program.
In April 1994, the C-17 program remained over budget, and did not meet weight, fuel burn, payload and range specifications. It also failed several key criteria during tests to evaluate its airworthiness."Air Force Letter To Douglas Spells Out 75 Defects For C-17."

In May 1994, a proposal to cut the aircraft's production to as few as 32 aircraft emerged, but was rescinded. "House rescinds cuts in C-17 program." San Diego Union, 25 May 1994.  A July 1994 GAO document revealed that Air Force and DoD studies from 1986 and 1991 stated the C-17 could use 6,400 more runways outside the U.S. than the C-5; it was later discovered that this study had only considered the runway dimensions, but not their strength or Load Classification Numbers (LCN). The C-5 has a lower LCN, but the USAF classify both in the same broad Load Classification Group (LCG). When considering runway dimensions and their load ratings, the C-17's worldwide runway advantage over the C-5 shrank from 6,400 to 911 airfields."Comparison of C-5 and C-17 Airfield Availability." United States General Accounting Office, July 1994.  However, the C-17's ability to use lower quality, austere airfields was not considered.
A January 1995 GAO report revealed that while the original C-17 budget was $41.8 billion for 210 aircraft, the 120 aircraft already ordered at that point had already cost $39.5 billion."C-17 Aircraft – Cost and Performance Issues."

Because of a dwindling order backlog, in 2010 Boeing transitioning to a lower production rate of 10 C-17s per year, from a high of 16 per year, to extend the production line as it works to sign additional international orders. The C-17 production line was previously slated to be closed several times, but was extended because of new orders received. The workforce will be reduced by approximately 1,100 through the end of 2012, mostly through the elimination of a second shift at the final assembly plant in Long Beach.

Design

The C-17 is . It can airlift cargo fairly close to a battle area. The size and weight of U.S. mechanized firepower and equipment have grown in recent decades from increased air mobility requirements, particularly for large or heavy non-palletized outsize cargo.
The C-17 is powered by four Pratt & Whitney F117-PW-100 turbofan engines, which are based on the commercial Pratt and Whitney PW2040 used on the Boeing 757.  Each engine is rated at 40,400 lbf (180 kN) of thrust. The engine's thrust reversers direct engine exhaust air upwards and forward, reducing the chances of foreign object damage by ingestion of runway debris, and providing enough reverse thrust to back the aircraft up on the ground while taxiing. The thrust reversers can also be used in flight at idle-reverse for added drag in maximum-rate descents. In vortex surfing tests performed by C-17s, up to 10% fuel savings were reported. "'Vortex surfing' could be revolutionary." U.S. Air Force, 11 October 2012. Retrieved: 23 November 2012.
The aircraft requires a crew of three (pilot, copilot, and loadmaster) for cargo operations. Cargo is loaded through a large aft ramp that accommodates rolling stock, such as a 69-ton (63-metric ton) M1 Abrams main battle tank, other armored vehicles, trucks, and trailers, along with palletized cargo. The cargo compartment is 88 feet (26.82 m) long by 18 feet (5.49 m) wide by 12 feet 4 inches (3.76 m) high. The cargo floor has rollers for palletized cargo that can be flipped to provide a flat floor suitable for vehicles and other rolling stock.
Maximum payload of the C-17 is 170,900 lb (77,500 kg), and its Maximum Takeoff Weight is 585,000 lb (265,350 kg). With a payload of 160,000 lb (72,600 kg) and an initial cruise altitude of 28,000 ft (8,500 m), the C-17 has an unrefueled range of about 2,400 nautical miles (4,400 km) on the first 71 aircraft, and 2,800 nautical miles (5,200 km) on all subsequent extended-range models that include sealed center wing bay as a fuel tank. Boeing informally calls these aircraft the C-17 ER."C-17/C-17 ER Flammable Material Locations." Boeing, 1 May 2005. The C-17's cruise speed is about 450 knots (833 km/h) (Mach 0.74).  It is designed to airdrop 102 paratroopers and their equipment."C-17 fact sheet." US Air Force. Retrieved 4 September 2013. The U.S. Army's Ground Combat Vehicle is to be transported by the C-17.
The C-17 is designed to operate from runways as short as 3,500 ft (1,064 m) and as narrow as 90 ft (27 m). In addition, the C-17 can operate from unpaved, unimproved runways (although with greater chance of damage to the aircraft). The thrust reversers can be used to back the aircraft and reverse direction on narrow taxiways using a three- (or more) point turn. The plane is designed for 20 man-hours of maintenance per flight hour, and a 74% mission availability rate.

Operational history

United States Air Force

The first production model was delivered to Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina on 14 July 1993. The first C-17 squadron, the 17th Airlift Squadron, became operationally ready on 17 January 1995. 94–95. The C-17 has broken 22 records for oversized payloads."Boeing C-17 Globemaster III Claims 13 World Records." Boeing, 28 November 2001. The C-17 was awarded U.S. aviation's most prestigious award, the Collier Trophy in 1994."Collier Trophy, 1990–1999 winners." National Aeronautic Association. Retrieved: 1 April 2010. A Congressional report on operations in Kosovo and Operation Allied Force noted "One of the great success stories... 39. The C-17 flew half of the strategic airlift missions in the operation, the type could use small airfields, easing operations; rapid turnaround times also led to efficient utilization. 40.
The U.S. Air Force originally planned to buy a total of 120 C-17s, with the last one being scheduled for delivery in November 2004. The fiscal 2000 budget funded another 14 aircraft, primarily for Air Mobility Command (AMC) support of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). Basing of the original 120 C-17s was with the 437th Airlift Wing and 315th Airlift Wing at Charleston AFB, South Carolina, the 62nd Airlift Wing and 446th Airlift Wing at McChord Air Force Base, Washington, the Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) 97th Air Mobility Wing at Altus AFB, Oklahoma, and the Air Mobility Command-gained 172nd Airlift Wing of the Mississippi Air National Guard at Jackson-Evers International Airport/ANGB, Mississippi.
An additional 13 aircraft went to AMC's 305th Air Mobility Wing and its Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) "associate" unit, the 514th Air Mobility Wing, at McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey; the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) 3rd Wing and the collocated Alaska Air National Guard's 176th Wing at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska in a shared associate arrangement; In FY 2006, eight C-17s were delivered to March Joint Air Reserve Base, California; controlled by the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), assigned to the 452d Air Mobility Wing; and subsequently assigned to AMC's 436th Airlift Wing and its AFRC "associate" unit, the 512th Airlift Wing, at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, supplementing the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy.dover.af.asp In 2011, the New York Air National Guard's 105th Airlift Wing at Stewart Air National Guard Base, New York, transitioned from the C-5 to the C-17."105th Airlift Wing, New York Air National Guard – History".

On 26 March 2003, 15 USAF C-17s participated in the biggest combat airdrop since the United States invasion of Panama in December 1989: the night-time airdrop of 1,000 paratroopers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade occurred over Bashur, Iraq. The airdrop of paratroopers were followed by C-17s ferrying M1 Abrams, M2 Bradleys, M113s and artillery. "1st ID task force's tanks deployed to northern Iraq." Stars and Stripes, 10 April 2003. Retrieved: 8 June 2011. USAF C-17s have also been used to assist allies in their airlift requirements, including Canadian vehicles to Afghanistan in 2003 and Australian forces during the Australian-led military deployment to East Timor in 2006. In 2006, USAF C-17s flew 15 Canadian Leopard C2 tanks from Kyrgyzstan into Kandahar in support of NATO's Afghanistan mission. In 2013, five USAF C-17s supported French operations in Mali, operating with other nation's C-17s (RAF, NATO and RCAF deployed a single C-17 each).

There has been debate about follow-on orders for the C-17, with the Air Force requesting line shutdown, and members of Congress attempting to reinstate production. Furthermore, in FY2007, the Air Force requested $1.6 billion to deal with what it termed "excessive combat use" on operational airframes., A. Butler and D. Barrie. "Boeing's C-17 wins against EADS' A400." Aviation Week & Space Technology, 13 March 2006, p. 43. However, in testimony before a House of Representatives subcommittee on air and land forces, General Arthur Lichte, USAF, the Commander of Air Mobility Command indicated the need to extend production to another 15 aircraft to increase the total to 205. Pending the delivery of the results of two studies in 2009, Lichte considered that the Air Force may have to keep the production line open for purchase of even more C-17s to satisfy airlift requirements.

Royal Air Force

Boeing has marketed the C-17 to many European nations including Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Royal Air Force (RAF) has established an aim of having interoperability and some weapons and capabilities commonality with the USAF. The 1998 Strategic Defence Review identified a requirement for a strategic airlifter. The Short-Term Strategic Airlift (STSA) competition commenced in September of that year, however tendering was canceled in August 1999 with some bids identified by ministers as too expensive, including the Boeing/BAe C-17 bid, and others unsuitable.O'Connell, Dominic. "Political clash haunts MoD deal decision." The Business (Sunday Business Group), 5 December 1999. The project continued, with the C-17 seen as the favorite. In the light of Airbus A400M delays, the UK Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon, announced in May 2000 that the RAF would lease four C-17s at an annual cost of £100 million from Boeing for an initial seven years with an optional two-year extension. The RAF had the option to buy or return the aircraft to Boeing. The UK committed to upgrading its C-17s in line with the USAF so that if they were returned, the USAF could adopt them.
The first C-17 was delivered to the RAF at Boeing's Long Beach facility on 17 May 2001 and flown to RAF Brize Norton by a crew from No. 99 Squadron. The RAF's fourth C-17 was delivered on 24 August 2001. The RAF aircraft were some of the first to take advantage of the new center wing fuel tank found in Block 13 aircraft. In RAF service, the C-17 has not been given an official service name and designation (for example, C-130J referred to as Hercules C4 or C5), but is referred to simply as the C-17 or "C-17A Globemaster".
The RAF declared itself delighted with the C-17. Although the Globemaster fleet was to be a fallback for the A400M, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced on 21 July 2004 that they had elected to buy their four C-17s at the end of the lease,"Review turns up the heat on eurofighter". Flight International, 22 July 2004. even though the A400M appeared to be closer to production. The C-17 gives the RAF strategic capabilities that it would not wish to lose, for example a maximum payload of 169,500 lb (77,000 kg) compared to the A400M's 82,000 lb (37,000 kg). The C-17's capabilities allow the RAF to use it as an airborne hospital for medical evacuation missions."The Air Hospital" Channel 4, 25 March 2010. Retrieved: 10 October 2012.
Another C-17 was ordered in August 2006, and delivered on 22 February 2008.  The four leased C-17s were to be purchased later in 2008. "UK receives fifth C-17, as RAF fleet passes 40,000 flight hours." FlightGlobal. Because of fears that the A400M may suffer further delays, the MoD announced in 2006 that it planned to acquire three more C-17s, for a total of eight, with delivery in 2009–2010. On 26 July 2007, Defence Secretary Des Browne announced that the MoD intended to order a sixth C-17 to boost operations in Iraq and Afghanistan."Browne: Purchase of extra C-17 will 'significantly boost' UK military operations."

On 13 January 2013, the RAF deployed two C-17s of No. 99 Squadron from RAF Brize Norton to the French Évreux Air Base. The aircraft are to transport French armored vehicles to the Malian capital of Bamako.

Royal Australian Air Force

The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) began investigating an acquisition of heavy lift aircraft for strategic transport in 2005. 40–41. In late 2005 the then Minister for Defence Robert Hill stated that such aircraft were being considered due to the limited availability of strategic airlift aircraft from partner nations and air freight companies. The C-17 was considered to be favored over the A400M as it was a "proven aircraft" and in production. One major RAAF requirement was the ability to airlift the Army's M1 Abrams tanks; another requirement was immediate delivery. Though unstated, commonality with the USAF and the United Kingdom's RAF was also considered advantageous. RAAF aircraft were ordered directly from the USAF production run and are identical to American C-17 even in paint scheme, the only difference being the national markings. This allowed delivery to commence within nine months of commitment to the program."Stock Standard". Aviation Week & Space Technology, 11 December 2006.
On 2 March 2006, the Australian government announced the purchase of three aircraft and one option with an entry into service date of 2006.

Royal Canadian Air Force

Canada's air arm has had a long-standing need for strategic airlift for humanitarian and military operations around the world. It had followed a pattern similar to the German Air Force in leasing Antonovs and Ilyushins for many of its needs, including deploying the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to tsunami-stricken Sri Lanka in 2005. The air service was forced to rely entirely on leased An-124 Ruslan for a Canadian Army deployment to Haiti in 2003. The service has also used a combination of leased Ruslans, Ilyushins and USAF C-17s for moving heavy equipment into Afghanistan. In 2002, the Canadian Forces Future Strategic Airlifter Project began to study alternatives, including long-term leasing arrangements. "Strategic lift capacity for Canada." The Ploughshares Monitor, Volume 26, Issue 2, Summer 2005.
