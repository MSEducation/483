The Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey is an American multi-mission, military, tiltrotor aircraft with both a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), and short takeoff and landing (STOL) capability. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft.
The V-22 originated from the United States Department of Defense Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program started in 1981. The team of Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the tiltrotor aircraft. The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft. The V-22 first flew in 1989, and began flight testing and design alterations; the complexity and difficulties of being the first tiltrotor intended for military service in the world led to many years of development.
The United States Marine Corps began crew training for the Osprey in 2000, and fielded it in 2007; it is supplementing and will eventually replace their Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knights. The Osprey's other operator, the U.S. Air Force, fielded their version of the tiltrotor in 2009. Since entering service with the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force, the Osprey has been deployed in both combat and rescue operations over Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan and Libya.

Development

Early development

The U.S. Department of Defense began the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program in 1981, under U.S. Army leadership.
The defining mission of the Marine Corps has been to perform an amphibious landing, and they were particularly interested in the JVX program. They realized that a concentrated strike force was vulnerable to a single nuclear weapon, airborne solutions with good speed and range allowed for significant dispersal;Whittle 2010, p. 55. and their CH-46s were wearing out;Whittle 2010, p. 91. without replacement, the threat of a merger between the Marine Corps and the Army lingered,Whittle 2010, p. 87: "As Kelly saw it, the future of the Marine Corps was riding on it."Whittle 2010, p. 155. similar to President Truman's proposal following World War II. 53, 55–56.

American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), 16–18 November 1983. A request for proposals (RFP) was issued in December 1982 for JVX preliminary design work. Interest in the program was expressed by Aérospatiale, Bell Helicopter, Boeing Vertol, Grumman, Lockheed, and Westland. The DoD pushed for contractors to form teams. Bell partnered with Boeing Vertol. The Bell Boeing team submitted a proposal for an enlarged version of the Bell XV-15 prototype on 17 February 1983. This was the only proposal received and a preliminary design contract was awarded on 26 April 1983. 31–33. "Hybrid Craft Being Developed for Military and Civilian Use." Los Angeles Times, 31 August 1984.
The JVX aircraft was designated V-22 Osprey on 15 January 1985; by that March, the first six prototypes were being produced, and Boeing Vertol was expanded to deal with the project workload.

On 3 May 1986, the Bell Boeing partnership was awarded a $1.714 billion contract for V-22 aircraft by the U.S. Navy. At this point, all four U.S. military services had acquisition plans for V-22 versions. "Bell-Boeing team lands contract to develop new tilt-rotor aircraft, 600 jobs expected from $1.714-billion project for Navy." Providence Journal, 3 May 1986.
The first V-22 was rolled out with significant media attention in May 1988. "Vertical-takeoff plane may be the 21st century's intercity bus." Toronto Star, 23 May 1988."Tilt-rotor craft flies like copter, plane." Milwaukee Sentinel, 24 May 1988. The project suffered several blows. That year, the U.S. Army left the program, citing a need to focus its budget on more immediate aviation programs. The project faced opposition in the Senate in 1989, surviving two votes that both could have resulted in cancellation."2 Senators key to fate of Boeing's V-22 Osprey." Philadelphia Inquirer, 6 July 1989. "Gramm defends Osprey's budget cost: Senator makes pitch for V-22 as president stumps for B-2 bomber." Dallas Morning News, 22 July 1989. Despite the Senate's decision, the Department of Defense instructed the U.S. Navy not to spend more money on the Osprey."Pentagon halts spending on V-22 Osprey." Chicago Tribune, 3 December 1989. When the V-22's projected development budget greatly increased in 1988, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney tried to remove funding from 1989 to 1992 in an effort to cancel it. He was eventually overruled by Congress, which provided unrequested funding for the program. 49. Multiple studies of alternative aircraft found the V-22 provided more capability and combat effectiveness with similar operating costs as the alternatives. 52. The Clinton Administration was supportive of the V-22 and helped the program attain funding.

Flight testing and design changes

Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 13 June 1991. From October 1992-April 1993, Bell and Boeing redesigned the V-22 to reduce empty weight, simplify manufacture, and reduce production costs. This redesigned version became the V-22B model.  V-22 flights resumed in June 1993 after safety improvements were incorporated in the prototypes. 55.  Bell Boeing was awarded a contract for the engineering manufacturing development (EMD) phase in June 1994. 52–54. The prototypes also received changes to better match the B-model configuration.  Flight testing at the stage focused on expanding the flight envelope, measuring flight loads, and supporting the EMD redesign.  This and further flight testing with the early V-22s continued into 1997. 55–57.

Flight testing of four full-scale development V-22s began in early 1997 when the first pre-production V-22 was delivered to the Naval Air Warfare Test Center, Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. The first EMD flight took place on 5 February 1997. Testing fell behind schedule. 23. The first of four low rate initial production aircraft, ordered on 28 April 1997, was delivered on 27 May 1999. Osprey number 10 completed the program's second sea trials, this time from  in January 1999.

Controversy

The V-22's development process has been long and controversial, partly due to its large cost increases. "Review of political forces that helped shape V-22 program." Texas Observer, 17 June 2004. The V-22's development budget was first planned for $2.5 billion in 1986, then increased to a projected $30 billion in 1988. As of 2008, $27 billion had been spent on the Osprey program and another $27.2 billion will be required to complete planned production numbers by the end of the program.
The V-22 squadron's former commander at Marine Corps Air Station New River, Lieutenant Colonel Odin Lieberman, was relieved of duty in 2001 after allegations that he instructed his unit that they needed to falsify maintenance records to make the aircraft appear more reliable.

With the first combat deployment of the MV-22 in October 2007, Time Magazine ran an article condemning the aircraft as unsafe, overpriced, and completely inadequate.

Design

Overview

The Osprey is the world's first production tiltrotor aircraft, with one three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It is classified as a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. "Tilters." Air & Space/Smithsonian, 1 September 2007. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90° in as little as 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel efficient, higher speed turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing capability is achieved by having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45°."V-22 Osprey Guidebook, 2013/2014." Bell-Boeing, 2013. Retrieved: 6 February 2014. "USMC V-22 Osprey Finds Groove In Afghanistan." Aviation Week, 12 January 2010. Retrieved: 23 June 2010. Other orientations are possible, such as the "80 Jump" takeoff which uses nacelles at 80° to quickly achieve high altitude and speed.
Composite materials make up 43% of the V-22's airframe. The proprotors blades also use composites. For compact storage and transport, partly on Marine launch ships, the V-22's rotors fold in 90 seconds and its wing rotates to align, front-to-back, with the fuselage., Jr., USAF. "A Research Report Submitted to the Faculty, In Partial Fulfillment of the Graduation Requirements: The CV-22 'Osprey' and the Impact on Air Force Combat Search and Rescue" (PDF). Air Command and Staff College, April 1999. Due to the requirement of folding the rotors, their 38 feet diameter is 5 feet less than optimal for vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. "Flying The Osprey Is Not Dangerous, Just Different: Veteran Pilots" defense.com, 5 September 2012. Retrieved: 16 September 2012. Most Osprey missions use fixed wing flight 75% or more of the time, reducing wear and tear on the aircraft and reducing operational costs. This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight communications for improved command and control.

Propulsion

The V-22's two Rolls-Royce AE 1107C engines are connected by drive shafts to a common central gearbox so that one engine can power both proprotors if an engine failure occurs. 98–99. However, if a proprotor gearbox fails that proprotor cannot be feathered, and both engines must be stopped before an emergency landing. The aircraft's autorotation characteristics are poor partly because the rotors have low inertia.
The V-22 has a maximum rotor downwash speed above 80 knots, more than the 64 knots lower limit of a hurricane. Assessment of Navy Heavy-Lift Aircraft Options p39. RAND Corporation, 2005.

Boeing has stated the V-22 design loses 10% of its vertical lift over a tiltwing design when operating in helicopter mode because of airflow resistance due to the wings, but that the tiltrotor design has better short takeoff and landing performance. "Boeing looks ahead to a 'V-23' Osprey." Flight Global,'' 22 June 2009.
In September 2013, Rolls-Royce announced it had increased the AE 1107C engine's power by 17% via the adoption of a new Block 3 turbine, an increase in fuel valve flow capacity, and accompanying software updates. The upgrade should increase the aircraft's reliability in high-altitude, high-heat conditions; maximum payload limitations are boosted from 6,000 ft to 8,000 ft. A Block 4 upgrade is reportedly being examined, which may increase power by up to 26%, producing close to 10,000 hp, and improve fuel consumption.com, 16 September 2013.

Avionics

The V-22 is equipped with a glass cockpit, which incorporates four Multi-function displays (MFDs, compatible with night-vision goggles) and one shared Central Display Unit (CDU), allowing the pilots to display a variety of images including: digimaps centered or decentered on current position, FLIR imagery (from the Turreted Forward Looking Infra-Red System)"V-22 Osprey - Boeing" primary flight instruments, navigation (TACAN, VOR, ILS, GPS, INS), and system status. The flight director panel of the Cockpit Management System (CMS) allows for fully coupled (autopilot) functions that take the aircraft from forward flight into a  hover with no pilot interaction other than programming the system. and Scott Brick.

"Marine Corps Aviation Assault Support for the 21st Century: Is There a Case for the MV-22." Defense Technical Information Center,'' 8 April 1992. The fuselage is not pressurized, and personnel must wear on-board oxygen masks above 10,000 feet.
The V-22 has triple-redundant fly-by-wire flight control systems., et al. "Advanced flight control technology achievements at Boeing Helicopters." International Journal of Control, Volume 59, Issue 1, 1994, pp. 263–290. With the nacelles pointing straight up in conversion mode at 90° the flight computers command the aircraft to fly like a helicopter, with cyclic forces being applied to a conventional swashplate at the rotor hub. With the nacelles in airplane mode (0°) the flaperons, rudder, and elevator fly the aircraft like an airplane. This is a gradual transition and occurs over the rotation range of the nacelles. The lower the nacelles, the greater effect of the airplane-mode control surfaces. 6–9, 95–96. The nacelles can rotate past vertical to 97.5° for rearward flight. 58. 97.  The aircraft also has computerized damage control that automatically isolates damaged elements."An Afghan Report: The Osprey Returns from Afghanistan, 2012." SLD, 13 September 2012. The controls so automate and simplify aspects of the V-22's flight that without wind it can hover with no hands on the controls; according to some who have flown the aircraft, former fixed-wing pilots may be preferable because they, unlike those with helicopter experience, are not trained to constantly adjust the controls while hovering.

Armament

The Osprey can be armed with one 7.62x51mm NATO (.308 in caliber) M240 machine gun or .50 in caliber (12.7 mm) M2 machine gun on the loading ramp, that can be fired rearward when the ramp is lowered.

As of June 2012, 32 Interim Defense Weapon Systems were available to the Marine Corps. The system has not been fired in combat as V-22s have been routinely escorted by helicopter gunships and close air support aircraft, allowing them to focus on their transport role; squadrons also often flew without the belly gun, as the added weight reduced its cargo-carrying capacity. The Osprey's speed means it can outrun supporting conventional helicopters, requiring a self-defense capability on long-range missions and operate independently. The infrared gun camera has proven valuable for reconnaissance and surveillance. Other weapons are being studied to provide an all-quadrant defensive weapon system, including nose guns, door guns, and nonlethal countermeasures to work with the current ramp-mounted machine gun and the IDWS.com, 13 February 2012

Refueling capability

Boeing is developing a roll-on/roll-off aerial refueling kit, which would give the V-22 the ability to refuel other aircraft. Having an aerial refueling capability that can be based off Wasp-class amphibious assault ships would increase the striking power of Marine F-35Bs, as they would not rely on refueling assets that could only be based on full-sized Nimitz-class aircraft carriers or from land bases.  The roll-on/roll-off kit can also be applicable to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance functions.com, 10 April 2013 Boeing has funded a non-functional demonstration on a VMX-22 aircraft. On 29 August 2013, proximity tests were conducted between a MV-22 and an F/A-18 Hornet.com, 29 August 2013.
The high-speed version of the hose/drogue refueling system is designed to be deployed at  of fuel. The operator must open the ramp to extend the refueling hose, then raise the ramp back up once it is extended, with the top ramp door left open. The Osprey could refuel rotary-wing aircraft, but it would require a separate drogue used specifically by helicopters and a partially converted nacelle. Bell and Boeing are hoping for funding for additional testing to include contact between the refueler and receiver and eventually the passage of fuel between the two aircraft.com, 3 September 2013

Potential operators

The Marine Corps has identified at least 15 possible candidates for sale of the V-22. Most are countries in the Middle Eastern and Pacific region. Although foreign nations are expected to only buy a handful of aircraft, they could account for up to 100 sales over 10 years.com, 9 September 2013

The United States Navy could potentially employ the V-22 in search and rescue, transport and anti-submarine warfare roles. The V-22 program has included 48 HV-22s for the navy, but none have been ordered. One proposal is to replace the C-2 Greyhound with the V-22 for Carrier Onboard Delivery duties.

V-22 proponents have said that it is capable of similar speed, payload capacity and lift performance as the C-2, the V-22 can also carry greater payloads over short ranges; up to 20,000 lb, and can also carry suspended external loads. The C-2 can only land on carriers, requiring further distribution to smaller vessels via helicopters; the Osprey is already certified for operating upon amphibious ships, aircraft carriers, and logistics ships; certification on hospital and small combatant ships has not yet been achieved. The V-22 could also take the roles of some helicopters, with a 600 lb hoist fitted to the ramp and a cabin configuration for 12 non-ambulatory patients and five seats for medical attendants.com, 2 August 2013

Bell and Boeing are pitching the Osprey to the Navy as more than a transport, but a platform for various missions, including hosting communications hardware or electronic-attack systems. Successful trials as an aerial refueling aircraft are hoped to persuade the Navy by filling a capability gap in tactical aerial refueling; this role is currently handled by Marine Lockheed Martin KC-130s, Air Force McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extenders, and select Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers with a hose-and-drogue delivery system.
