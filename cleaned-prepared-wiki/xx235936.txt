[[Wind power in Belgium]]

CATEGORIES: Wind power in Belgium

Wind power in Belgium depends partially on regional governments (Brussels-Capital Region, Flemish Region, Walloon Region)  and partially on the Belgian federal government. Wind energy producers in both the Flemish and Walloon regions get green certificates but not with the same  conditions.
On February 8, 2014, due to high winds, 16% of the consumed electricity was generated by wind turbines. At the start of 2012, there were 498 operational wind turbines in Belgium, with a capacity of 1080 MW.be, 11 janvier 2012 The amount of electricity generated from wind energy has surpassed 2 TWh per year.

Background

The Belgian State committed to generate 13% of its energy (i.e. electricity and heating) from sustainable sources by 2020. The annual wind energy potential in Belgium is estimated at 8.2 TWh (5.4 TWh offshore, 2.8 TWh onshore). This requires a production capacity of 2.1 GW offshore and 1.1 GW onshore. Wind energy makes up 47% of the 17 TWh renewable energy potential by 2020, according to the GEMIX report. In 2008, Belgium consumed 88 TWh of electricity (excluding electricity that was not transported on the high voltage grid).
Wind turbines are mainly installed offshore and in the Flemish and Walloon Regions. Brussels-Capital Region is an urban area which is not particularly suited for large wind turbines. Smaller turbines more appropriate for urban environments are being studied but until today no technology is deemed sufficiently efficient.
The expanding capacity and the intermittent nature of wind power creates challenges for grid operator Elia. Requiring accurate wind forecasts
In September 2010, a survey was held by the Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen among more than 800 families who live very close to wind turbines in West Flanders. The results were better than expected. Before the turbines were constructed 59.3% were satisfied, this percentage rose to 68.3 after they were constructed. In addition 83.9% didn't oppose the construction of additional wind turbines.

Offshore wind farms

By Royal Order of May 200417 MEI 2004. — Koninklijk besluit tot wijziging van het koninklijk besluit van 20  december 2000 betreffende de voorwaarden en de procedure voor de toekenning van domeinconcessies voor de bouw en de exploitatie van installaties voor de productie van elektriciteit uit water, stromen of winden, in de zeegebieden waarin België rechtsmacht kan uitoefenen overeenkomstig het internationaal zeerecht
an area is reserved for the production of renewable energy. This area was subdivided into seven concessions. All of which have since been awarded to project developers. Two projects are already producing electricity, the others are in various stages of planning.

Belwind

The Bligh Bank Offshore Wind Farm will have an installed capacity of 330 MW and is expected to produce 1.1 TWh annually. The first half of the farm (165 MW) was completed on 9 December 2010. Accessed: 10 December 2010. The construction of the second phase is planned for 2014.

C-Power

The first two construction phases of the Thorntonbank Wind Farm were completed in 2012. Currently the wind farm has a capacity of 215 MW. 


Planned projects

Energy island

In order to use the generation capacity more efficiently plans are being made to construct an artificial island 3 km from Wenduine. On the island a lake would function as the reservoir of a pumped storage power station, estimated to produce 300 MW for 3 hours a day. The project is currently only in the concept phase.

Flemish Region

sources:
At the end of 2011 there were 191 operational onshore wind turbines with a combined capacity of 341.7MW. Due to the a lack of vast open spaces the wind turbines are installed in more than 60 small groups throughout the region. Often along highways or canals and in industrial or agricultural areas.
The operators of these wind farms are diverse. Some are operated by companies that specialize in wind power like Aspiravi or Electrawinds. Others by traditional electricity producers Electrabel and SPE. Several are operated by cooperatives like Ecopower or Aspiravi Samen. Finally a few are operated by organisations with a different core business like retail network Colruyt or pharmaceutical company Pfizer as part of a Corporate social responsibility strategy. Colruyt's turbines produce an estimated 13.75 GWh annually.
Installed capacity per province (as of 2012):

Walloon Region

sources:
This region is home to the largest turbines in Belgium. The Windvision wind farm near Estinnes houses 11 Enercon E-126 turbines each with a total height of 198.5 metres and a generation power of 6 MW. The park is part of the EU demonstration project 7MW-WEC-by-11 nine turbines will be upgraded to 7.5 MW.
Greenwind built a 25 MW park of 10 turbines of 2.5 MW in Froidchappelle.
