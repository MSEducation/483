Early life and family

Leahy was born in Montpelier, Vermont, the son of Alba (née Zambon) and Howard Francis Leahy, a printer. His grandparents came to Vermont from Ireland and Italy during the 19th century to work at quarries.
He graduated from Saint Michael's College in 1961 and received his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1964. He practiced as a lawyer until he was elected as State's Attorney of Chittenden County in 1966 and re-elected in 1970.
Leahy married Marcelle Pomerleau in 1962; she is bilingual with French Canadian heritage from Quebec immigrants in Vermont. They reside in a farmhouse in Middlesex, Vermont that they moved to from Burlington, and have three children.

U.S. Senator

Early career (1974–1997)

Leahy was elected to the United States Senate for the first time in November, 1974, in the wake of the Watergate scandal that had resulted in the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in August of that year. He won a close race with Republican Rep. Richard Mallary who was Vermont's lone congressman at the time.  Leahy succeeded retiring 34-year incumbent George Aiken.  In 1986, he faced what was on paper an even stronger challenger in former governor Richard Snelling, but Leahy turned back this challenge, taking 64 percent of the vote.  He has faced only one substantive Republican challenger since then, when in 1992 Vermont Secretary of State Jim Douglas held him to 54 percent of the vote.
Leahy was the first non-Republican Senator from Vermont since 1856. To this day, he is the only Democrat ever elected to the Senate from Vermont.  He is technically one of only three Democrats to represent Vermont in either house of Congress since the end of the Civil War. However, his election hastened Vermont's trend towards the Democratic Party, and since 2001, two other Vermont Senators have caucused with the Democrats. Jim Jeffords was elected as a Republican before he switched to become an Independent, while Bernie Sanders was elected as an Independent; he won and then refused the Democratic Party nomination.
During his tenure as Vice-Chairman of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 1987, Leahy showed an unclassified draft report on the Iran-Contra affair to a news reporter.  At a press conference, Leahy stated, "Even though it was declassified, I was way too careless about it," and accepted blame.  Disclosure of that information was against the Intelligence Committee rules, and Leahy said he hastened his already planned departure from the committee because he was so angry at himself.

Later career (1998–present)

The 1998 election was noteworthy in that Leahy had the endorsement of his Republican opponent, Fred Tuttle. Tuttle was the lead actor in the movie Man with a Plan, shot in Vermont, in which a farmer decides to run for the House.  Tuttle told voters to vote for Leahy because he didn't want to move to Washington D.C. Leahy was touched by this gesture; he once said that Tuttle was the "distilled essence of Vermonthood".

At the end of the exchange, Cheney told Leahy, "Go fuck yourself".'Countdown with Keith Olbermann' for July 25 – Countdown with Keith Olbermann. MSNBC (2007-07-26).
