Lynx is a highly configurable text-based web browser for use on cursor-addressable character cell terminals., 22 years later, still in use and development.

History

Lynx was a product of the Distributed Computing Group within Academic Computing Services of the University of Kansas,

Garrett Blythe created DosLynx in April 1994 and later joined the Lynx effort as well. Foteos Macrides ported much of Lynx to VMS and maintained it for a time. In 1995, Lynx was released under the GNU General Public License, and is now maintained by a group of volunteers led by Thomas Dickey.
ALynx is an Amiga port of Lynx made in 1995 by P. Marquardt. The current stable version of ALynx is 1.29 and is still available to be downloaded from the Amiga Aminet Repository.

Features

Browsing in Lynx consists of highlighting the chosen link using cursor keys, or having all links on a page numbered and entering the chosen link's number.
Unlike most web browsers, Lynx does not support JavaScript or Adobe Flash, which some websites require to work correctly.
The speed benefits of text-only browsing are most apparent when using low bandwidth internet connections, or older computer hardware that may be slow to render image-heavy content.

Privacy

Because Lynx does not support graphics, web bugs that track user information are not fetched; therefore, web pages can be read without the privacy concerns of graphic web browsers.
Similarly, Lynx also supports browsing histories and page caching,

Configurability

Lynx accepts configuration options from either command-line options or configuration files. There are 142 command line options according to its help message. The template configuration file lynx. There is some overlap between the two, although there are command-line options such as -restrict which are not matched in lynx.  In addition to pre-set options by command-line and configuration file, lynx's behavior can be adjusted at runtime using its options menu. Again, there is some overlap between the settings. Lynx implements many of these runtime optional features, optionally (controlled through a setting in the configuration file) allowing the choices to be saved to a separate writable configuration file. The reason for restricting the options which can be saved originated in a usage of lynx which was more common in the mid-1990s, i.e., using lynx itself as a front-end application to the Internet accessed by dial-in connections.

Accessibility

Because of its refreshable braille display and text-to-speechâ€“friendly interface, Lynx can be used for internet access by visually impaired users.

Remote access

Lynx is  also useful for accessing websites from a remotely connected system in which no graphical display is available.

Web design and robots

Since Lynx will take keystrokes from a text file, it is still very useful for automated data entry, web page navigation, and web scraping, thus Lynx is used in some web crawlers.
Lynx is also used to test web sites' performance. As one can run the browser from different locations over remote access technologies like telnet and ssh, one can use Lynx to test the web site's connection performance from different geographical locations simultaneously.

Supported platforms

Lynx was originally designed for Unix-like operating systems, though it was ported to VMS soon after its public release are also available.
The sources can be built on many platforms, e.g., mention is made of Google's Android operating system.
