In 1340, the total population of Europe was 54 million; by 1450, it would be 37 million, a 31% drop in only a century. In addition to the earlier social and economic decline, the Black Plague is identified as the superficial cause, which struck Europe and wiped out a full third of the population in short space of 1348-1350. It has been described as "a pandemic of plagues such as the world had not seen since the sixth century and was not destined to see again till the 1890s."Davies, p 409 It was actually three related diseases: bubonic plague and septicaemic plague, carried by fleas hosted by the black rat, and pneumonic plague, the especially fast and lethal airborne variant. The few areas that escaped included Poland,Davies, p 411 Hungary,Fossier, p 55 Rouergue in France, Liège in Belgium, and the county of Béarn in the Pyrenees.  It has been suggested that these areas were spared due to the predominance of O-Blood type, which had only recently taken root in the heartlands of Europe, although this hypothesis has yet to be proven.
The pandemic, which began in central Asia, was first reported in Europe in the summer of 1346. The Genoese colony of Caffa in the Crimea was besieged by the Tartars, who catapulted plague-ridden corpses into the city. The defenders carried the disease back to Italy; in October 1347 it reached Messina in Sicily, in December a ship carried the virus in Marseille,Fossier, p 53 and by January 1348 it was in Genoa.  The plague then moved northward through France.Hollister, p 283  According to the French monk Guillaume de Nangis:
The reasons for the plague's success are not yet entirely understood.  Urban overcrowding, declining sanitary conditions and the "lively European trade in (rat-infested) grain" have been cited as causes of the plague's rapid transmission; while favourable climatic conditions and the summer months may also have aided its spread.  In the summer of 1348 it reached England, arriving first at Melcombe Regis in Dorset.  It had spread through the southwestern shires to London by winter.  It peaked in the summer of 1349,Hollister, p 283-284 when it was passed on into Germany and Austria, and in winter it was in Scotland, Scandinavia and Spain.
In general, towns were hit more severely than rural areas, the poor more than the rich, and the young and fit more than the old and infirm." Hundreds died in each parish, although some figures may have been exaggerated. Norwich, a city that did not exceed 17,000, was reported as having lost 57,000. The figure was probably closer to 50,000. Regardless, modern studies make it clear that the plague's toll in this decade was heavy.Hollister, p 284
Heaviest hit were the clergy, who were brought into direct contact with plague victims. Guillaume de Nangis records that "some monks and friars, being braver, administered the sacraments", and that the sisters at the hospital of Paris, "fearless of death, carried out their task to the end with the most perfect gentleness and humility. These sisters were all wiped out by death…" In the dioceses of York and Lincoln, about 44% of the clergy perished, while nearly 50% died in the Exeter, Winchester, Norwich and Ely. In all, half of the English clergy may have died.
In 14th century England, the Black Plague "served as a somber backdrop to a deepening economic crisis… and growing social tensions and religious restlessness."Hollister, p 282 Villages were deserted, herds were untended, wool and grain markets were crippled and land values plummeted. However, it is also suggested that in Europe in general, the Black Plague solved the economic recession, in that the reduction in population returned the supply of cash credit and money per capita to its pre-crisis level, laying the foundation for recovery.1  At the end of the decade, the economic effects of the Black Plague "may well have been more purgative than toxic."

Culture, religion and philosophy

=Architecture=

A number of European building projects were completed in the 1340s, mainly consisting of cathedrals and universities. In 's-Hertogenbosch, construction was finished on the Romanesque church begun in 1220, which was later rebuilt as the 16th century St. John's Cathedral. In the German city of Mainz, work was completed on the Collegiate Church of St. Stephan, begun in 1267. In Naples, three decades of work were finished on the monastery of Santa Chiara.
The High Gothic choir of St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, was consecrated in 1340.Toman, p 178 In 1344, Prague was made an archbishopric, and the foundation stone was laid on the new St. Vitus Cathedral. In Ely Cathedral, the last part of the repairs to the structure was finished with the richly decorated Lady Chapel in 1345.Toman, p 144-145
In Venice, the Venetian Gothic Palazzo Ducale, or Doge's Palace, was erected on top of older buildings in 1340. Berne's Käfigturm was erected from 1256 to 1344 as the second western city gate. In Siena, the Torre della Mangia of the Palazzo Pubblico was completed in 1348.
The Scuola della Carità, one of the six Scuole Grandi of Venice, was built in 1343. Two medieval universities were established in the 1340s: the University of Pisa (1343) and the University of Prague (1347). while Pembroke College, Cambridge, was completed in 1347.Neillands, p 109-110

=Art=

In religious art, a series of stained glass windows were completed for the choir clerestory of Évreux Cathedral in Normandy c. 1340.
The possibilities of Giotto's art were developed further in this decade by his pupils Maso di Banco and Bernardo Daddi. An illustration by the artist Domenico Lenzi, the City Scene of 1340 from the Il Biadaiolo codex, shows just how much the Florentine artists were influenced by Giotto.Toman, p 464-465
In 1340, toward the end of his life, the painter Simone Martini was called to Avignon to work for the papal court.  Another notable religious artist was the Pisan painter Francesco Traini, who painted the Triumph of St. Thomas Aquinas as part of an Italian altarpiece "which reflects the divine order of the cosmos".Toman, p 439
In sculpture, the main artist was Andrea Pisano, who maintained a workshop in Pisa with his son Nino Pisano from 1343-1347.

=Literature=

In 1341, Petrarch was crowned poet laureate in Rome, the first man since antiquity to be given this honor.

=Military technology=

It was around this decade that medieval cannon began to be used more widely in Europe, appearing in small numbers in several European states by the 1340s.Delbrück, p 28Nossov (2005), p 209   "Ribaldis" were first mentioned in the English Privy Wardrobe accounts between 1345 and 1346, during preparations for the campaign in France. The effectiveness of these cannon was limited, as they are believed to have only shot large arrows and simple grapeshot, but they were so valuable that they were directly controlled by the Royal Wardrobe. Contemporary chroniclers such as the French Jean Froissart and the Florentine Giovanni Villani record their destructiveness on the field at the Battle of Crecy in 1346.

=Philosophy and religion=

In the 1340s, Catholic Church was governed under the Avignon Papacy.  Pope Benedict XII died on 25 April 1342, and was buried in a mausoleum in Avignon Cathedral. He reigned as pope until 1352.
In 1340s, the controversial Franciscan friar and Scholastic philosopher William of Ockham was at Munich under the protection of the Holy Roman Emperor, Louis of Bavaria, since 1330. Among the followers of Ockhamism — condensed as the omnipotence of God and Occam's Razor — were John of Mirecourt (fl. c. 1345) and Nicholas of Autrecourt (fl. c. 1347), both of whom taught at the University of Paris. Ockham, Mirecourt and Autrecourt all agreed on the principle of noncontradiction and experience as bases of certainty.
On November 21, 1340, Autrecourt too was summoned him to Avignon to respond to allegations of false teaching. The trial, under Pope Benedict XII and his successor Clement VI, lasted until his conviction in 1346. Autrecourt was charged with 66 erroneous teachings or "articles", which he publicly recanted before the papal court. He recanted them in public again, in Paris in 1347. Although Ockham also expressed willingness to resubmit to the Church and Franciscan Order, there is no evidence of a formal reconciliation. Ockham is sometimes said to have died in 1349, but it is more likely to have been 1347, possibly of the Black Plague.
In 1343, Clement VI issued the papal bull Unigenitus.  The bull defined the doctrine of "The Treasury of Merits" or "The Treasury of the Church" as the basis for the issuance of indulgences by the Catholic Church.

Africa

In Egypt, the Mameluk sultans were constantly changing. In 1347, the Blue Mosque was completed in Cairo.
In the Horn of Africa, the 1340s were part of the century and a half (1314-1468) that comprised "the crowning era of medieval Ethiopia", which began with the reign of Amda Seyon I.Henze, p 65-66  On Amda's death in 1344, the size of his Christian Empire was double what it had been in 1314.Henze, p 65  He was succeeded as emperor by his eldest son Newaya Krestos, who followed his father's policies toward the Mulisms in the east, most of whom continued to be tributaries of Ethiopia.Henze, p 67
In the Mali Empire of West Africa, Mansa Souleyman, who had assumed office in 1341, took steep measures to put Mali back into financial shape, developing a reputation for miserliness.  However, he proved to be a good and strong ruler despite numerous challenges.  It is during his reign that Fula raids on Takrur began.  There was also a palace conspiracy to overthrow him hatched by the Qasa (Manding term meaning Queen) and several army commanders. Mali was at this time the dominant empire of West Africa, having conquered Songhai. The Songhai Empire would not regain independence for another three decades.Rees, p 6

The Americas

Very little is known of the Americas in this period, save what can be determined from archaeology.  In North America, the Mississippian culture was in a continued state of decline.  The city of Cahokia had experienced gradual decline since the 1200s, possibly due to contributory factors such as depletion of resources, climatic change, war, disease, social unrest and declining political and economic power.
Other Mississippian sites which went into decline after this decade, from about 1350 on, include the Kincaid Mounds  In the case of the latter, the decline was marked by a loss of the appearance of a town and a decrease in the importation of goods.  Although the site retained its ceremonial and political functions, some of the mounds were abandoned while others lost their religious importance altogether.
In Central America, the Mayans, who centuries earlier had suffered a serious decline, were ruled from a capital in the Yucatan Peninsula called Mayapan.  Other pre-Columbian civilisations, however, were on the rise.  The precursors to the Aztecs, the Mexicas, had recently founded their capital city of Tenochtitlan. They also had occasional skirmishes with the nearby Mixtec civilization.
