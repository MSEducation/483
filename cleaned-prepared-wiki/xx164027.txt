Season 2 (2002)

Season 2 premiered on ANT1 on March 8, 2002 and was on for a duration of 116 days. The season ended on July 1, 2002.

Season 3 (2003)

Season 3 premiered on ANT1 on March 10, 2003 and was on for a duration of 113 days. The season ended on June 30, 2003. This season was known as "The Wall" and introduced the notion of "The Battle," in which the house is separated into a luxurious half and a poor half, with two teams of housemates constantly fighting for time in the luxurious half. Expectations for the format proved unsuccessful with ANT1 choosing not to use it again.

Season 4 (2005)

ANT1 decided to revive the Big Brother concept in 2005 again, with Season 4 premiering on ANT1 on October 3, 2005 for a duration of 88 days. The season ended on December 29, 2005. Season 4 featured a new format and was known as "Big Mother". In "Big Mother", the nine housemates take part in the game with their mothers, with whom they must coexist during the contest. The "mamas" were not able to win the prize but they would stay with their children until their eviction. However, this proved to be a failure with the show's audience and the show switched back to the traditional Big Brother format in mid-season. Despite the switch back to the traditional Big Brother format, ratings still did not meet expectations and ANT1 decided to abandon the Big Brother franchise.
  Nikos won â‚¬200,000.- cash prize.

Critical reception

Big Brother was criticized for the voyeuristic nature of the show, in which contestants volunteer to surrender their privacy in return for minor celebrity status and a comparatively small cash prize, has attracted much scorn. On numerous occasions, participants in the various series have become sexually involved with each other, sometimes engaging in intercourse in front of Big Brother's cameras. This recorded material is typically not broadcast due to its explicit nature, as in the Australian and American editions. Other editions, however, such as the German and British versions, do broadcast it. The Internet stream also captures such moments, which has led to some controversy, with certain jurisdictions such as Greece attempting to have the show removed from the airwaves.
