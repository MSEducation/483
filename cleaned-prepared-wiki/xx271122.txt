[[Lake Jipe]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Kenya, Lakes of Tanzania, Pangani basin

Lake Jipe is an inter-territorial lake straddling the borders of Tanzania and Kenya. On the Tanzanian side, it is situated within Mwanga District, in Kilimanjaro Region while on the Kenyan side, it is located south of the village of Nghonji. The lake is fed mainly by the Lumi River, which descends from Mount Kilimanjaro, as well as streams from the North Pare Mountains, being on the leeward side.

Geography

The lake is accessible via the B1 Highway from the village of Kifaru, about  Mount Kilimanjaro's Kibo Peak is viewable from the lake.

Demographics

Some 120,000 people depend on the lake for their livelihood. The inhabitants of villages surrounding Lake Jipe are mainly involved in fishing, agriculture and animal husbandry. To the south-east of the great mountain is the little agricultural colony of Taveita. Ki-taveita is the language used by the Bantu half of the population, and Maasai is the language of the remainder. Ki-gweno is the dialect of the Ugweno mountains (Ugono) to the south of Lake Jipe. Lake water is used for irrigation of the surrounding farmlands.

Fauna

The probability of long-time isolation from other wetlands is suggested by a fish endemic to the lake, the Jipe tilapia. Jipe's waters are teeming with big fish, principally siluroids and cyprinoids. Jipe forms a biodiversity rich ecosystem also known for the water birds that frequent its reedy shores; these include storks, egrets, pelicans, spur-winged plovers, ducks, and Egyptian geese. Lesser Jacana and the Purple Gallinule are common on the lake despite being rare in other parts of Africa and Madagascar Squacco Heron, Black Heron, African Darter and African Skimmers are often seen. The vicinity of the lake is  frequented by herds of game. Hippopotami and crocodiles are plentiful.
