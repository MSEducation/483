Martin "Marty" Knollenberg (born September 21, 1963) is a Republican politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. He was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives, representing the 41st District which covers the cities of Troy and Clawson in Oakland County. He is the son of former U.S. Congressman Joe Knollenberg, who represented Michigan's 9th congressional district from 1993 until 2009.
Knollenberg was elected to the State House in 2006 and re-elected in 2008 and 2010.  He was term limited in 2012 and succeeded by Republican Martin Howrylak.  He had previously served as an Oakland County Commissioner from 2002 to 2004 and Oakland County Parks and Recreation commissioner from 2004 to 2006.

Education

Knollenberg has a bachelors degree in history from Albion College.

Political career

Knollenberg has served three terms in the Michigan State House. He pushed for legislation in 2011 that would prevent teachers from receiving pay increases while they negotiate their labor contracts.
During his tenure in the Michigan House, Knollenberg sat on the redistricting committee. Following his father's defeat in 2008 by Gary Peters, Knollenberg was expected to use his position to gerrymander the district. Political analyst Bill Ballenger said "I didn't think there's any question that he would love to seek revenge on behalf of his father if the circumstances are right â€” especially if it's against Peters."
In early 2013 Marty Knollenberg was among candidates planning to run for mayor of Troy after mayor Janice Daniels was recalled in the November 2012 election. 18, 2013

Elections

2004 election

Knollenberg was a candidate for election in the 2004 Republican primary for the 41st District House seat, being vacated by term-limited representative John Pappageorge. He faced former-State Representative Bob Gosselin who was running for his final term after leaving office in 2002 to run for state Senate, and upstart candidate Mike Bosnic.
Bosnic was also a subject of Knollenberg's literature. He was accused by Knollenberg of accepting an illegal $2,500 contribution from the Heroes of Public Education, which was then a new PAC subject to a smaller campaign contribution limit. Campaign finance reports later revealed that the Secretary of State required Bosnic to repay $2,000 dollars of the donations because it exceeded campaign limits. 
Despite Pappageorge's endorsement of Knollenberg, the August primary was won by Gosselin with 38% of the vote, with Knollenberg garnering 29% and Bosnic 28%.

2006 election

In the August 2006 primary, Knollenberg faced Clawson School Board Trustee and attorney Mike Bosnic. Knollenberg won by a 53.5-46.5% margin.  The contest was labeled by Michigan Information & Research Service (MIRS), a Lansing-insider political publication, as the fourth most interesting primary in Michigan.
Knollenberg defeated Democratic college student Eric Gregory in the November general election by a 58-42% margin.

2008 election

Knollenberg was re-elected with 57.46% of the vote for his second-term in November 2008, defeating opponent Evan Ross Treharne (41.98%), a 24-year old school teacher. In the campaign, Knollenberg made attacks ads about Treharne's age. 

2010 election

Knollenberg was re-elected to the Michigan House for a final time in November 2010.

2012 election

Knollenberg was term-limited in 2012 and in 2011 formed a congressional campaign committee in anticipation of running for a seat in the US House of Representatives. He abandoned his plans after being redistricting into the same district as Thaddeus McCotter.
