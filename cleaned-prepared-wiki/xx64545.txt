[[Truncated octahedron]]

CATEGORIES: Uniform polyhedra, Archimedean solids, Space-filling polyhedra, Zonohedra

In geometry, the truncated octahedron is an Archimedean solid. It has 14 faces (8 regular hexagonal and 6 square), 36 edges, and 24 vertices. Since each of its faces has point symmetry the truncated octahedron is a zonohedron. It is also the Goldberg polyhedron GIV(1,1), containing square and hexagonal faces. Like the cube, it can tile (or "pack") 3-dimensional space, as a permutohedron.

Construction

A truncated octahedron is constructed from a regular octahedron with side length 3a by the removal of six right square pyramids, one from each point. These pyramids have both base side length (a) and lateral side length (e) of a, to form equilateral triangles. The base area is then a2. Note that this shape is exactly similar to half an octahedron or Johnson solid J1.
From the properties of square pyramids, we can now find the slant height, s, and the height, h, of the pyramid:
The volume, V, of the pyramid is given by:

Orthogonal projections

The truncated octahedron has five special orthogonal projections, centered, on a vertex, on two types of edges, and two types of faces: Hexagon, and square. The last two correspond to the B2 and A2 Coxeter planes.

Coordinates

All permutations of (0, ±1, ±2) are Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of a truncated octahedron of edge length a = √ 2 centered at the origin. The vertices are thus also the corners of 12 rectangles whose long edges are parallel to the coordinate axes.
The edge vectors have Cartesian coordinates ) at edges shared by a hexagon and a square.

Permutohedron

The truncated octahedron can also be represented by even more symmetric coordinates in four dimensions: all permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4) form the vertices of a truncated octahedron in the three-dimensional subspace . Therefore, the truncated octahedron is the permutohedron of order 4.

Area and volume

The area A and the volume V of a truncated octahedron of edge length a are:

Uniform colorings

There are two uniform colorings, with tetrahedral symmetry and octahedral symmetry:

Related polyhedra

The truncated octahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.
It also exists as the omnitruncate of the tetrahedron family:
This polyhedron can be considered a member of a sequence of uniform patterns with vertex figure (4.6.2p) and Coxeter-Dynkin diagram .  For p < 6, the members of the sequence are omnitruncated polyhedra (zonohedra), shown below as spherical tilings. For p > 6, they are tilings of the hyperbolic plane, starting with the truncated triheptagonal tiling.
The truncated octahedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of uniform polyhedra and tilings with vertex figures n.6.6, extending into the hyperbolic plane:

Related polytopes

The truncated octahedron (bitruncated cube), is first in a sequence of bitruncated hypercubes:

Tessellations

The truncated octahedron exists in three different convex uniform honeycombs (space-filling tessellations):
The cell-transitive bitruncated cubic honeycomb can also be seen as the Voronoi tessellation of the body-centered cubic lattice. The truncated octahedron is one of five three-dimensional primary parallelohedra.
