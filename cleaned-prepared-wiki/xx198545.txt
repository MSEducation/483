[[DAMPs]]

CATEGORIES: Immunology

Damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) also known as danger-associated molecular pattern molecules, are molecules that can initiate and perpetuate immune response in the noninfectious inflammatory response. (In contrast, Pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) initiate and perpetuate the infectious pathogen inflammatory response.) 

History

Two papers appearing in the same year presaged the deeper understanding of innate immune reactivity, dictating the subsequent nature of the adaptive immune response. The first 

Examples of DAMPs

DAMPs vary greatly depending on the type of cell (epithelial or mesenchymal) and injured tissue. Protein DAMPs include intracellular proteins, such as heat-shock proteins  heparin sulfate and DNA.

HMGB1

The chromatin-associated protein high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a prototypical leaderless secreted protein LSP secreted by hematopoietic cells through a lysosome-mediated pathway. and acts on several immune cells to trigger inflammatory responses as a DAMP. Known receptors for HMGB1 include TLR2, TLR4 and RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts). HMGB1 can induce dendritic cell maturation via upregulation of CD80, CD83, CD86 and CD11c, induce production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines in myeloid cells (IL-1, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8) as well as upregulate expression of cell adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) on endothelial cells.

DNA and RNA

The presence of DNA anywhere other than the nucleus or mitochondria is perceived as a DAMP and triggers responses mediated by TLR9 and DAI that drive cellular activation and immunoreactivity. Interestingly, some tissues such as the gut are inhibited by DNA in their immune response.  Similarly, damaged RNAs released from UVB-exposed keratinocytes activate TLR3 on intact keratinocytes.  TLR3 activation stimulates TNF-alpha and IL-6 production, which initiate the cutaneous inflammation associated with sunburn.

S100 Molecules

S100 is a multigenic family of calcium modulated proteins involved in intracellular and extracellular regulatory activities with a connection to cancer as well as tissue, particularly neuronal, injury.

Purine Metabolites adenosine, uric acid

Nucleotides (such as ATP) and nucleosides (such as adenosine) that have reached the extracellular space can also serve as ''danger''signals.

Clinical Targets in Various Disorders

Theoretically, the application of therapeutics in this area to treat disorders as arthritis, cancer, ischemia-reperfusion, myocardial infarction and stroke could include options as:
