In a 1999 interview, Kinski denied that her father had sexually molested her as a child, but said he had abused her "in other ways." In 2013, when interviewed about the allegations of sexual abuse made by her half-sister Pola Kinski, she confirmed that he tried with her, but did not succeed. She said: 
 "He was no father. 99 percent of the time I was terrified of him. He was so unpredictable that the family lived in constant terror." When asked what she would say to him now, if she had the chance, she replied: "I would do anything to put him behind bars for life. I am glad he is no longer alive."
After the age of ten, Kinski rarely saw her father. Her mother struggled financially to support them. They eventually lived in a commune in Munich.

Career

Kinski began working as a model as a teenager in Germany. Actress Lisa Kreuzer of the German New Wave helped get her the role of the dumb Mignon in Wim Wenders film The Wrong Move. In 1976, while still a teenager, Kinski had her first two major roles: in Wolfgang Petersen's feature-film length episode Reifezeugnis of the German TV crime series Tatort. Next she appeared in the British horror film To the Devil a Daughter (1976), produced by Hammer Film Productions.
She has said that during this period, she felt exploited by the industry. In an interview with W magazine she said, "If I had had somebody to protect me or if I had felt more secure about myself, I would not have accepted certain things. Nudity things.
