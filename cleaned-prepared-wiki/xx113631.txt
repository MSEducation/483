Abhas Mitra
(born June 3, 1955) is an Indian astrophysicist best known for his distinct views on
several front-line astrophysics concepts, particularly black holes. He presently heads the theoretical astrophysics section of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India.
Mitra's research papers have regularly questioned the mainstream cosmological concepts of "Big Bang"  and "Black Hole",A. Mitra, Nature, 501, 391 (2013) 

Prominent Scientific Work

Eternally Collapsing Objects

Though Mitra stresses that the `Black Hole'' solutions are correct, his contention is that Black Hole masses, arising from relevant
integration constants, are actually zero. His peer reviewed paper published in Journal of Mathematical Physics of the American Institute of Physics supports this contention by showing that Schwarzschild black holes have M = 0.A. Mitra, J. Math. Phys. 50, 042502 (2009) (American Institute of Physics)[ref]A. Mitra, Astrophysics and Space Science,
 Volume 332,  pp 43-48 (2011) (Springer, Germany) </ref><ref>A. Mitra,Foundations of Physics Letters,
 Volume 15, pp 439-471 (2002) (Springer, Germany)</ref><ref>A. Mitra, Foundations of Physics Letters,
 Volume 13,  pp 543-579 (2000) (Springer, Germany) </ref> 
Mitra's peer reviewed papers describe why continued physical gravitational collapse should lead to formation of ECOs rather than true black holes, and the mathematical ``black hole'' states can be achieved only asymptotically.A. Mitra, Phys. Rev. D 74, 024010 (2006)(American Physical Soc., USA)  acknowledges Mitra's original contribution in this context, and this is rare for any astrophysics research which is completely rooted in India rather than abroad.

Against the Big Bang Paradigm

As per the present version of Big Bang Paradigm, almost 70% of the mass energy of the universe is due to ``Dark Energy'' whose most
likely form is Einstein's Cosmological Constant. But Mitra's research has shown that Cosmological Constant is exactly zero as suspected by many. Mitra, General Relativity and Gravitation
 Volume 42,  pp 443-469 (2010) (Springer, Germany) </ref> 
In addition, these papers point out that as per cosmological observations, the actual universe is far more complex than the idealized perfect ``isotropy
and homogeneity'' assumed by the Big Bang model; and ``Dark Energy'' is an illusion caused by such departures.

X-ray Binaries

Mitra is the first astrophysicist to suggest that photo-meson process rather than proton-proton collision process could be the leading mechanism for Ultra High Energy gamma-ray production in ultra-compact X-ray binaries.A. Mitra, Astronomy and Astrophysics, Vol. 234,  L5-L8 (1990) (EDP Sciences, France) 

Academic Associations

Mitra is associated with the `Himalayan Gamma Ray Observatory  being set up at Han Leh jointly by Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and
Indian Institute Of Astrophysics. 
He is also an Adjunct Prof. in Homi Bhabha National Science Insititute since 2010.
Dr. Mitra is also a prestigious member of the International Astronomical Union.
