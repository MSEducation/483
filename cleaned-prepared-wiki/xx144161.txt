Paolo Pulici (; born 27 April 1950) is a Italian football manager and former footballer who played as a striker. With 172 total goals for Torino, he is the the club's leading all-time goalscorer alongside other Torino club icons Marco Ferrante (125), Valentino Mazzola (123), Ciccio Graziani (122) and Rolando Bianchi (77).
He is nicknamed Puliciclone (a name invented by Gianni Brera), or, more affectionately, Pupi.

Club career

Initially courted by Internazionale, he was ultimately rejected as the club believed his left-foot only shooting could not match that of their striker Sandro Mazzola.
In 1972 the coach Gustavo Giagnoni excluded Pulici from the starting lineup for a period of two months, devoting him to the technical refinement with the help of the technicians of the youth sector. In the league from 1972–73 he scored 17 goals, emerging as top scorer in Serie A along with Gianni Rivera and Giuseppe Savoldi.
He played with Torino for 14 seasons, disputing 437 games, scoring 172 goals in between the league and cup competitions. In addition to the championship in 1975–76, he won second place in the league in 1976–77 and the Coppa Italia in 1971.
In subsequent years after the conquest of the Scudetto, his number of goals diminished, scoring a minimum of 3 in the 1979–80 season, coinciding with the departure of Torino head coach Luigi Radice. In 1982 he was allowed to leave Torino for free, moving to Udinese; after a season in Friuli, he went to Fiorentina, with whom he ended his playing career.

International career

Pulici made his full international debut on 30 March 1973, in a 5–0 win over Luxembourg in a World Cup qualifier in Genoa. His first goals were a brace on 30 December 1975 in a 3–2 friendly win over Greece in Florence, his 7th cap. He then scored in his subsequent two matches, against Portugal and the United States.
In total, he played 19 matches and scored 5 goals for the Italy national football team. Internationally, Pulici played in 19 games and scored 5 goals; often deployed in tandem with Graziani. Failing to repeat the performance offered at Torino, he was often replaced by Roberto Bettega.

Coaching career

After retiring, he joined the technical staff of Piacenza as assistant coach, after the Emilian club contacted him to resume athletic activities.

Style of play

A left-footed forward fast and physically strong, was particularly gifted in the air and acrobatic; he was also an accomplished penalty taker.
