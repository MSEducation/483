[[Power metal]]

CATEGORIES: Power metal, Heavy metal subgenres

Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, in contrast to the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally "powerful" sound.net) The term was first used in the middle of the '80sPower Metal (guitarmasterclass.

Origins

Anthropologist Sam Dunn traced the origins of power metal back to the late 1970s, when the groundwork for power metal lyrical style was laid down by Ronnie James Dio. The fantasy-oriented lyrics he wrote for Rainbow, concentrated around medieval, renaissance, folk and science fiction themes, directly influenced modern power metal bands. It is mentioned that songs "Stargazer" and "Kill the King", from the 1976 album Rising and 1978's Long Live Rock 'n' Roll respectively, might be among the earliest examples of power metal. In his 2011 documentary series Metal Evolution, Dunn further explained how Rob Halford of Judas Priest created a blueprint for power metal vocal delivery. His almost constant high-pitched singing became one of the main characteristics of power metal. The twin-guitar sound promoted by duo of K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton highly influenced this sub-genre.
Another British band, Iron Maiden, brought epic and melodic sensibility to metal, creating anthemic, singalong music, an approach widely embraced by modern power metal musicians. The emergence of the early German power metal scene in particular was made possible by Scorpions and Accept. Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen made a significant impact on many future power metal guitarists, with his accurate and fast neo-classical style. His bandmate Jens Johansson modernized the keyboard sound of Deep Purple's Jon Lord, which was further incorporated into the genre. American band Manowar's mythological sword and sorcery lyrics influenced a number of power metal bands. In 1987 Helloween released their second album, Keeper of the Seven Keys, Pt. 1, cited by Allmusic as "a landmark recording that remains arguably the single most influential power metal album to date. Its volatile combination of power and melody would inspire an entire generation of metal bands".Helloween – Biography

Musical characteristics

Power metal is today associated with fast tempo and melodic harmonies, the sound tempered by characteristics of speed metal, power metal's musical forerunner.

Vocals

Power metal is highly focused on the vocalist, with "clean" vocals being much more prevalent than the growling vocals often associated with extreme metal. Inspired by Ronnie James Dio, Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford, Geoff Tate and other heavy metal vocalists, power metal vocals are often in a high register, and the singers vocal range is usually wide.com) The majority of the genre's vocalists sing in the tenor range, capable of hitting very high notes, for example Timo Kotipelto of Stratovarius, Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween) and Andre Matos (ex-Angra). There are however many exceptions who sing in either baritone or bass range. Some vocalists sing in a harsh, thrash metal style, like Chris Boltendahl of Grave Digger, Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray and Peavy Wagner of Rage, or even make use of growls, like Alexi Laiho of Children of Bodom Many power metal vocalists record multi-layered vocals reminiscent of Queen, most notably Hansi Kürsch of Blind Guardian, creating a choral effect.Helloween cover Queen's song 'Sheer Heart Attack' (Blabbermouth net)

Lyrical themes

Power metal's lyrical themes, though as varied as metal itself, often focus on fantasy and mythology, camaraderie and hope, personal struggles and emotions, war and death, or combinations of the listed themes. Many Power metal bands based their concept albums on fantasy books and national epics; for example Blind Guardian based their Nightfall in Middle-Earth on The Silmarillion by Tolkien and Kamelot based Epica and The Black Halo on Goethe's Faust. Historical wars inspired numerous bands, like Sabaton, Grave Digger or HammerFall. Some bands have even written their own imaginary stories, like Rhapsody of Fire's Emerald Sword Saga and The Dark Secret Saga, Iced Earth's Something Wicked Saga or Avantasia by Edguy's Tobias Sammet. Many otherwise typical metal themes such as religion and politics are comparatively rare but not unheard of.

Instrumentation

Power metal guitarists and bassists generally play rapid streams of notes, but change chords comparatively slowly, with a harmonic tempo of once per measure or slower. Fast and demanding guitar solos, however, are almost guaranteed. The slow changing of chords are significant in defining power metal just as the fast rapid chord changes often define traditional thrash metal. Power metal often makes use of Major chord progressions as well as circle progressions. Some of the most influential and acclaimed power metal guitarists are Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray, Michael Weikath of Helloween, and Timo Tolkki formerly of Stratovarius. It is a common trait in power metal for the bass guitar to take a back seat, so to speak; often simply providing the chord root notes and being drowned out by the more prevalent rhythm guitars. However, some power metal bands incorporate bass that is more audible with colorful patterns distinct from the rhythm guitars, such as Helloween, Hibria, and Symphony X.
Many power metal drummers play double bass patterns with either two bass drums, or utilize a double bass pedal or using them to play a constant stream of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) with snare drum accents on the beat, a style not restricted to, but most often associated with, power metal. The style was used by drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg of Helloween, setting a blueprint for many other drummers to follow. Others, such as the drummers of Blind Guardian and Iced Earth, use a more thrash metal style of drumming with rapid bursts of double bass that involve three to six beats with the double kick. Even more uncommon, but not unheard of, is the use of the blast beat.
Power metal bands often incorporate keyboards into their musical arrangements, something popularized by Jens Johansson of Stratovarius, though their usage varies from subtle accents to a full-blown melody line. Some power metal bands also record with symphonic elements, and as such, they utilize a full orchestra to fill the role usually played by the keyboardist.

Types of power metal

American power metal

This branch of power metal emerged in early 1980s in the United States, drawing its influences mainly from traditional metal and the NWOBHM. Though very close to its roots, US power metal (often abbreviated USPM) is often faster and more energetic than traditional heavy metal, with a more riff-driven approach than its later European counterpart and with a relative lack of keyboards, but more melodic and often with a higher emphasis on guitar leads than thrash. USPM is also notable for its wide (but not universal) use of high-register operatic vocals, a trend which would continue with the rise of European power metal in the late '80s and early '90s.
The early releases of progressive metal bands Queensrÿche and Fates Warning, such as The Warning (1984) and The Spectre Within (1985), heavily influenced a number of bands that were to develop a common sound towards the late 1980s. Among the better known representatives of the style, such as Vicious Rumors, Virgin Steele, Riot or Jag Panzer, a small number of bands enriched their sound with progressive and epic elements; the most obvious examples being Crimson Glory, Savatage, Sanctuary and the epic doom metal band Cirith Ungol.com) US power metal saw a sharp decline in popularity at the beginning of the '90s, though the style has rebounded somewhat in the past decade, with bands such as Liege Lord or Heir Apparent reforming for live performances"Reunited Liege Lord to Headline Next Year's Keep It True XVI Festival". and some, like Helstar, Omen and Manilla Road, releasing new material.

European power metal

European power metal originated from speed metal and the NWOBHM, emerging in mid-to-late 1980s, particularly in Germany, with Helloween, Running Wild, Rage and Blind Guardian, followed by Finland's Stratovarius in the early 1990s. These bands pioneered the genre, but took it in somewhat different directions. Helloween, followed by early Gamma Ray, mixed fast palm muted speed metal riffs with high-pitched clean vocals, and with a strong focus on melody and uplifting, positive themes. Stratovarius further developed this melodic direction by making heavy use of keyboards, with lyrics dealing with emotions and personal issues. Blind Guardian utilized the technique of vocal and guitar overdubbing to create an еpic atmosphere, with lyrical content strongly based on fantasy novels, myths and legends. The symphonic and neo-classical elements also found their way through power metal with bands like Rhapsody of Fire and Nightwish.
HammerFall simplified their power metal to bring it closer to traditional heavy metal. This genre spread over Europe, often incorporating further influences from progressive and folk music. Italy's Elvenking, Sweden's Falconer and Denmark's Wuthering Heights are in particular influenced by folk music, while Angra, Kamelot, and especially Symphony X are known for combining progressive and power metal. Furthermore, some bands are known for combining power metal with more aggressive musical forms, such as Children of Bodom, who combined elements of power and melodic death metal. Two Helloween albums, Keeper of the Seven Keys, Part 1 (1987) and Part 2 (1988) are usually considered the first proper European power metal albums.com)
In the first decade of 21st century, DragonForce and Nightwish have become the first power metal bands to achieve moderate mainstream commercial success.
