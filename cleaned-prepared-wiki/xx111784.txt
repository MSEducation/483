The London Aquatics Centre is an indoor facility with two  diving pool in Olympic Park at Stratford, London, it was one of the main venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics. The centre was used for the swimming, diving and synchronised swimming events.  After significant modification the centre is due to open to the public in 2014.

Design

It was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid in 2004 before London won the bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The centre was built alongside the Water Polo Arena, and opposite the Olympic Stadium on the opposite bank of the Waterworks River. The site is .
The complex has a 50m competition pool, a 25m competition diving pool and a 50m warm-up pool.
Because the centre was designed before the Olympic bid was completed, the spectator wings were not part of the original design. They were later added to fit the estimated audience.
Jacques Rogge, IOC President, described the Centre as a "masterpiece".

Construction

On 1 December 2005 Hadid was instructed to revise her designs after a specification change led to a doubling of the £75 million estimated cost."Olympic Pool Plans To Be Revised". BBC Sport. 1 December 2005. Retrieved 9 June 2012. The revised plans were unveiled on 27 November 2006."London Scales Down 2012 Pool Plan". BBC Sport. 17 November 2006. Retrieved 9 June 2012. Although the same general design was kept, with capacity for 17,500 spectators, the revised Aquatics Centre design was much smaller and was expected to cost much less than previously expected. However, subsequent cost increases were reported to Parliament in 2008. "London Olympic Organizers Say Aquatics Site Work Ahead of Plan".  Bloomberg.  Retrieved 7 August 2012.
The construction contract was awarded to Balfour Beatty in April 2008."UK Firms Sign Venue Contracts".  london2012. 8 April 2008. Retrieved 9 June 2012. At the same time, it was reported that the centre would cost about three times as much as was originally estimated, totalling about £242 million. The cost increases were attributed to construction inflation and VAT increases, and also included the estimated cost of converting the facility for public use after the Olympic and Paralympic Games. 
The Centre was completed in July 2011 at a final cost of £269 million.
The design demonstrates the precast-concrete skills with by exposing the concrete finish rather than painting or cladding which was provided by Peri. The precast floor terracing was manufactured by Bell & Webster Concrete in Lincolnshire, England.  The terracing units were delivered and positioned to accelerate the speed of construction. The unique six-board diving platform is made from 462 tonnes of concrete. The aluminium roof covering was provided by Kalzip. The steel structure was built in cooperation with Rowecord Engineering, of Newport, Wales. The ceiling was built with 30,000 sections of Red Lauro timber. The steel roof weighs 3,200 tonnes. The three pools hold around 10 million litres (2.6 million gallons) of water.
After the Paralympic Games, the Aquatic Centre was deconstructed to result in a smaller space. The frame wings on either side of the central space were removed, unbolted, and sold. The PVC wrap that temporarily enclosed the space was also sold, while the seats and toilets were reused elsewhere.interiordesign.php As certain parts of the building were no longer needed, they were recycled via Vinyloop. This allowed the standards of the Olympic Delivery Authority concerning environmental protection to be met.PVC at Olympics destined for reuse or recycling

Capacity

During the Games the venue had a capacity of 17,500. The two temporary "wings" have been removed, reducing the capacity to a regular 2,500 with an additional 1,000 seats available for major events.  Of all the swimming venues built for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Aquatics Centre is the only one that will remain afterwards, albeit in a downsized form.
