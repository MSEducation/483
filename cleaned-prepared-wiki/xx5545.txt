Historical populations

The biggest population difficulty in Kuwait involves the Bidoon, stateless people numbering just over 100,000 who are classed as illegal residents and who are trying to claim Kuwaiti citizenship.  In 2013 a law was passed to grant citizenship to 4,000 of these people as part of an attempt to resolve the problem.  However, the government has said that only a third of the Bidoon would qualify for possible naturalisation as it considers that the rest hold other nationalities, with officials alleging that they have destroyed their documents in order to claim Kuwaiti citizenship.
