History

The airport was named after the general and politician Juan Pistarini (1882–1956). Its construction was one of the major projects in the five-year plan of the first presidency of Juan Perón. When it opened, it was the third-largest airport in the world.
The first civil flight from the then new London Heathrow Airport, a BSAA Avro Lancastrian, flew to Ministro Pistarini International Airport in 1946. A 1949 diagramAmerican Aviation 1 August 1949 p15 shows three runways crossing at 60-degree angles: 9,353 ft runway 10/28, 7,220 ft 4/22 and 6,892 ft 16/34. In 1997, RWY 05/23 was closed and it is now used for parking large aircraft (such as the Airbus A340 or Boeing 747).
The Ezeiza massacre took place near the airport in 1973.
