Graeme Dott (born 12 May 1977) is a Scottish professional snooker player from Larkhall. He turned professional in 1994 and first entered the top 16 in 2001. He has won two ranking titles, the 2006 World Snooker Championship and the 2007 China Open, and was runner-up in the World Championships of 2004 and 2010. He reached number 2 in the world rankings in 2007, but a subsequent episode of clinical depression seriously affected his form, causing him to drop to number 28 for the 2009/2010 season. He then recovered his form, regained his top-16 ranking, and reached a third World Championship final. In 2011, he published his autobiography, Frame of Mind: The Autobiography of the World Snooker Champion.

Career

Early career

After winning the UK Under-19 Championship in 1992 and Scottish Amateur Championship in 1993, Dott turned professional in 1994. He slowly climbed the rankings, reaching the top sixteen in 2001, where he remained until 2009. Early successes included reaching the quarter-final of the 1996 Welsh Open and qualifying for the World Championship for the first time in 1997. Dott was a runner-up in the 1999 Scottish Open, the 2001 British Open, the 2004 World Championship and the 2005 Malta Cup. He scored his only competitive 147 break in the 1999 British Open.

2006 World Championship victory

Dott started his campaign with an easy 10–3 victory over former champion John Parrott, before beating veteran Nigel Bond 13–9 in the second round. His quarter-final match was against Australia's Neil Robertson, and after leading 12–8, he was pegged back to 12–12, before edging through the deciding frame, winning the tie 13–12. In the semi-finals he faced former two-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan in a rematch of the 2004 final. At 8–8 after the second session of four sessions, O'Sullivan failed to win a single frame in the third session and Dott dominated play to win easily 17–11.
Dott faced Peter Ebdon in the final for the £200,000 prize. He began the last session of the match leading 15–7, but Ebdon won six successive frames to reduce his deficit to two frames. Dott eventually won by 18 frames to 14, after winning some vital frames with marvellous clearances. It was the longest final ever and was, at the time, the latest to finish (John Higgins's victory over Mark Selby the following year now holds the record). The previous record holder was the classic final frame last black ball finish 1985 final between Englishman Steve Davis and Northern Irishman Dennis Taylor, which finished at 12:19 a.m. (GMT). The Dott-Ebdon match finished half an hour later, this despite featuring three fewer frames, reflecting the slow overall pace of the match. The average frame length was such that both afternoon sessions only had six frames, instead of the usual eight. Moreover, at just over 74 minutes, the 27th frame was the then longest in the history of the World Championship (until 2009), even beating the 70 minute mark of the previous record set by Canadian Cliff Thorburn and Welshman Doug Mountjoy.
The victory over Ebdon took his ranking up to number 6 for 2006/07 season, a career high at the time.

Post-title career

Dott shone in the 2006 UK Championship as well, reaching the semi-finals, where he lost 7–9 to Stephen Hendry (who he had never beaten in a ranking tournament) in the opening match of the tournament, which dented his prospects of remaining no. 1. Newly crowned world champion John Higgins overtook him. The loss against McCulloch also maintained the "Crucible Curse", as Dott became the seventeenth consecutive first-time champion to lose his title the very next year.
The 2007/2008 season was more of a struggle for Dott, subsequently sliding to #13 in the new world rankings, and finishing the season outside the top 32 in the one-year rankings.
Things did not improve in the early part of 2008/2009, when a broken left arm sustained while playing football forced him to pull out of the 2008 Shanghai Masters and 2008 Grand Prix.
Dott did win the Berlin leg of the World Series of Snooker, He reached the second round of the 2009 World Championship for the first time since winning the title in 2006, but lost to Mark Selby 10–13, dropping him out of the top 16.
In the 2010 World Championship Dott produced an unlikely run to his third World final in six years. Dott had not had much success in the 2009/2010 season going into the World Championship, with only one ranking last 16 finish, in the 2010 Welsh Open; however, a newly inspired Dott convincingly knocked out Peter Ebdon in the first round 10–5. He then thrashed fellow Scot Stephen Maguire 13–6 in the second round and for the first time since winning the title in 2006 advanced to the quarter-finals where he recovered from 10–12 behind to see off Mark Allen 13–12. In his 17–14 defeat of Mark Selby in the semi-final he scored the second 146 clearance in the 83-year history of the World Championship (Mark Allen had hit the first days earlier in his match with Dott). Dott was eventually defeated in the final 13–18 by Neil Robertson, who had never beaten Dott previously – ironically after Dott had defeated Ebdon for the first time in winning his own title in 2006. Despite having to settle for runner-up spot, Dott's efforts were ultimately rewarded with a return to the Top 16 for 2010/2011.
Dott returned a year later with a strong campaign at the World Championship beating Mark King and Ali Carter before losing to in-form Judd Trump in the quarter-finals.

2011/2012 season

Dott missed the first ranking event of the 2011/2012 season, the Australian Goldfields Open due a neck injury.
Dott lost 2–4 to Ben Woollaston in the final of Event 3 of the minor-ranking Players Tour Championship, after earlier overcoming Ronnie O'Sullivan, Stephen Hendry and John Higgins.
Dott played in the first ever professional snooker tournament to be staged in South America, the non-ranking Brazil Masters, and reached the final only to be whitewashed 0–5 by Shaun Murphy.
Dott's season came to an unceremonious end at the World Championship as he suffered his heaviest ever defeat at the event. He lost to Joe Perry 1–10, stating after the match that it was the worst he had played as a professional.

2012/2013 season

During the 2012/2013 season, Dott lost in the last 16 of the UK Championship (2–6 to Shaun Murphy), the German Masters (4–5 to Murphy), the Welsh Open (1–4 to Pankaj Advani), the World Open (0–5 to Neil Robertson), and the China Open (4–5 to Marcus Campbell). He reached the quarter-finals of the Wuxi Classic, where he lost 0–5 to Mark Davis, and the Shanghai Masters, where he lost 4–5 to Judd Trump.
Dott's best performance of the season came in the 2013 Masters, where he defeated Stephen Maguire 6–5 and Trump 6–1 to reach the semi-finals. Despite taking a 4–1 lead in his semi-final match, Dott lost 5–6 to eventual tournament winner Mark Selby.
At the World Championship, Dott defeated Peter Ebdon 10–6 in a first-round match that lasted 7 hours 18 minutes, with an extra session added after the players failed to complete the match in the time allotted for the first two sessions. After the match, Dott criticised Ebdon's slow, deliberative style of play and called for a rule to limit the amount of time a player could spend over a shot.

2013/2014 season

Dott's 2013/2014 season did not get off to a good start, as he was whitewashed 0–5 by Jimmy Robertson in the last 64 of the season's first major ranking event, the 2013 Wuxi Classic.

Personal life

In his 2011 autobiography Frame of Mind, Dott describes his childhood growing up in the run-down Easterhouse estate in Glasgow. The couple married in 2003 and had their first child, a son named Lewis, in 2004.
In January 2006, Alex Lambie was diagnosed with terminal kidney cancer. Although he lived to see Dott win the World Championship in May of that year, he passed away on 16 December 2006, while Dott was playing in the 2006 UK Championship. Weeks afterward, Elaine, who was pregnant, had a cancer scare when doctors discovered potentially cancerous cysts on her ovaries. Although she turned out not to have cancer, she suffered a miscarriage while Dott was playing in the 2007 Masters. After these experiences, Dott entered a severe depression, which affected his commitment to practice and his performance in matches. He lost 15 professional matches in a row and slid down the rankings, dropping out of the top 16. Medication subsequently helped him recover his place in the top 16, although he expects his battle with depression to be lifelong. Dott and his wife had a second child, a daughter Lucy, born in November 2008.
Dott supports Rangers and paraded his World Championship trophy at Ibrox, their home ground, during half-time of Rangers' final league match against Hearts on 7 May 2006.
