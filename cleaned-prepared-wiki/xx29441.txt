Aho was the prime minister of the centre-right coalition government (Centre Party, National Coalition Party, Christian Democrats and Swedish People's Party) from 1991 to 1995. He is best known for leading Finland into the European Union. Aho's own party, gaining most of its support from rural areas, was the most opposed to EU membership among major parties. Their greatest concern was the agricultural situation, Finland applied for EU membership on 16 March 1992 and a referendum was held two and a half years later. Despite a steep rise in the national debt, the Aho government applied a stringent cut-and-save policy that made it unpopular. This partly caused its fall in the 1995 election and Centre Party's eight-year period in opposition.3.2011.
