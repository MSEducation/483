Massey Ferguson Limited is a major agricultural equipment manufacturer which was based in Brantford, Ontario, Canada before it was purchased by AGCO. The company was formed by a merger between Massey Harris and the Ferguson Company farm machinery manufacturer in 1953, creating the company Massey Harris Ferguson. However, in 1958 the name was shortened for the first time to coin the brand Massey Ferguson. Today the company exists as a brand name used by AGCO and remains a major seller around the world.

History

The firm was founded in 1847 in Newcastle, Ontario by Daniel Massey as the Newcastle Foundry and Machine Manufactory. The company began making some of the world's first mechanical threshers, first by assembling parts from the United States and eventually designing and building their own equipment. The firm was taken over and expanded by Daniel's eldest son Hart Massey who renamed it the Massey Manufacturing Co. and in 1879 moved the company to Toronto where it soon became one of the city's leading employers. The massive collection of factories, consisting of a  site with plant and head office at 915 King Street West, became one of the best known features of the city. Massey expanded the company and began to sell its products internationally. Through extensive advertising campaigns he made it one of the most well known brands in Canada. A labor shortage throughout the country also helped to make the firm's mechanized equipment very attractive.

Massey-Harris revolutionized grain harvesting in 1938 with the world's first self-propelled combine - the No. 20. Unfortunately, it was too heavy and expensive for extensive mass production. However, it served as a guide for the building of the lighter and less costly No. 21, which was tested in 1940 and put on sale in 1941. The Massey-Harris No. 21 Combine was commemorated with a Canada Post stamp on June 8, 1996. 21 Combine commemorative stamp bulletin

Sawyer-Massey

In a complex turn of events, the Massey family turned to steam engine builder Sawyer of Hamilton, Ontario, and started a line of steam tractors. These engines were quite successful
and were built in a number of sizes. The 25 horsepower was popular, and the expanding Prairie provinces clamoured for big breaking engines. Massey also experimented with
tandem compound engines. Sawyer Massey lasted only until 1910 when the firm was wound down, and Massey went into oil engines. Sawyer-Massey and Massey-Harris were
two separate companies, both managed by the Massey family.

Wallis Gas Tractor and wider influence

Massey began experimenting with oil engines about 1910, with engines such as the Bulldog. However, success came only later in the 1920s with the Wallis line of tractors which was purchased by the firm.
In the 1930s, it introduced the first self-propelled combine harvester. Massey Harris also produced one of the world's first four-wheel drive tractors. Hart Massey's sons Charles, Walter, Chester and Fred became closely involved in the business and eventually took over its operations. They were, however, the last generation of Masseys to run the company. Other members of the family went on to other accomplishments: Vincent Massey became Governor General of Canada and Raymond Massey became a noted actor in American films. The Massey family used its fortune to improve the city of Toronto and many institutions, such as the University of Guelph, University of Toronto, Upper Canada College, Crescent School, Appleby College, Massey Hall and Metropolitan United Church, were partially financed by the Masseys.

Massey-Harris-Ferguson

In 1953, the company merged with the Ferguson Company to become Massey-Harris-Ferguson, before finally taking on its current name in 1958.

Massey Ferguson

The company shortened the name to Massey Ferguson in 1958, and tried to consolidate the two dealer networks and product lines. Its television and radio advertising featured an upbeat jingle, with a male chorus singing, "He's a get-up-early, keep-'em-rollin', Massey-Ferguson kind of a man." But the company soon began to decline financially. Facing increasing international competition and an agricultural sector diminishing in importance, the firm began to struggle.

=Sunshine=

In 1955, Massey purchased the Australian H.V. McKay company, manufacturers of the brand Sunshine. Hugh Victor McKay had invented the stripper harvester in 1884, the first machine to combine the functions of reaping, threshing and winnowing grain from a standing crop. McKay later established a manufacturing base at Ballarat, and then transferred to Braybrook Junction, where he took over the Braybrook Implement Company Works and renamed it the Sunshine Harvester Works after the harvester's brand name. Residents of Braybrook Junction subsequently voted to change the name of the suburb to Sunshine after the harvester in 1907. By the 1920s the H.V. McKay Company was running the largest implement factory in the southern hemisphere, covering , and were leading the international agricultural industry through the development of the world's first self-propelled harvester in 1924.
In 1930 the H.V. McKay Company was granted exclusive Australian distribution of Massey-Harris machinery. The company was then renamed H.V. McKay Massey Harris Pty Ltd. Throughout World War II H.V. McKay Massey Harris exported over 20,000 Sunshine drills, disc harrows and binders to England to facilitate the increase in food production.
In the 1950s the H.V. McKay company was progressively sold off to Massey Ferguson.
The factory was progressively sold off from 1970 until manufacturing was halted with the last section sold off and demolished in 1992. The former bulk store, factory gates and clock tower, the pedestrian footbridge, factory gardens and head office complex are all listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

=Landini=

In 1959, Massey bought 100% of Landini, based in Italy. Landini has built many models for Massey over the years, especially vineyard and crawler models. Massey sold 66% to ARGO SpA in 1989, some to Iseki later on, and the final portion was sold to in 2000.

=Perkins=

In 1959 Perkins Engines of Peterborough, England, was purchased, Perkins having been the main diesel engine supplier for Massey Ferguson for many years. In 1990, Massey Ferguson took over Dorman Diesels of Stafford and merged it with Perkins to form Perkins Engines (Stafford) Ltd. In the 1980s, Perkins purchased Rolls Royce (Diesels) Ltd, to form Perkins Engines (Shrewsbury) Ltd. Perkins was sold off in 1998 by then owner LucasVarity to Caterpillar Inc., who were a major customer for their smaller and mid-sized engines; Caterpillar was a major producer of large diesel engines for static and mobile application.The Massey Legacy, by John Farnworth, ISBN 978-0-85236-403-1

=Ebro of Spain=

In 1966, Massey purchased 32% of the Spanish tractor and auto company Ebro, or Motor Iberica. Ebro had previously built Ford tractors under license, but now began building models for Massey, and Massey models under license. Massey sold its interest to Nissan in the 1980s.Ford Iberica - Ebro
In the early 1960s MF moved their Head Office from 915 King Street to the Sun Life tower at 200 University Avenue in the downtown core.
Starting in 1969, Massey Ferguson began producing a line of snowmobiles by the name Ski Whiz. The snowmobile line was discontinued in 1977, due to a decline in sales.

=Conrad Black take-over=

In the 1970s, Conrad Black, whose family had purchased control of Massey Ferguson's parent company, Argus Corporation, became active in Massey Ferguson's management. Under Black's leadership, Massey Ferguson instituted significant cost-cutting programmes that returned the company to profitability. During the late 1970s, production was relocated to a new large facility in Brantford, Ontario. In 1978 Massey Ferguson was the first to introduce an electronic control system for the three-point hitch on a tractor.
In 1973, Massey purchased the German company Eicher, and many Massey-licensed Eichers were built. They later sold their interest, and Dromson now owns the company. They now build specialized tractors for vineyards and such.
However, a world-wide decline in the agricultural equipment market combined with high inflation, high domestic interest rates and a major recession, caused Massey Ferguson to slip into a loss once again. In October of 1980, Argus donated its shares in Massey Ferguson to the employee's pension plans, leading the way to a $250 million bail-out from the Government of Canada and the Province of Ontario for the collapsing company which later renamed itself Varity Corporation. In the mid-1980s, Varity spun off several money-losing divisions into an entity called Massey Combines Corporation in 1985. Massey Combines Corporation was headquartered in Brantford, Ontario and became insolvent on March 4, 1988,Per MCC Employee and its assets were re-acquired by Massey Ferguson.

=Fermec sale=

In 1992, a management buyout of MF Industrial created the company Fermec, which finally ceased trading in 2001 when it was taken over by the Terex Corporation (Terex was formerly a unit of General Motors). This encompassed all construction equipment from Massey. It was then purchased by J. I. Case Company in 1997.TEREX Construction
Varity left Toronto and relocated to their head offices to the Williams-Butler House at 672 Delaware Avenue in the Millionaire Row area of Buffalo, New York. 
Despite some of the company's hardships, Massey Ferguson was selling 25% more tractors than its nearest competitors at this time. In 1995 Massey Ferguson's worldwide holdings were purchased by the US-based AGCO Corporation. In August 1996, Varity merged with Lucas Automotive to become LucasVarity.
After a series of mergers and take-overs, the remains of LucasVarity were taken over by the US company TRW. Since 1962, Massey Ferguson has been the world's leading tractor brand. Currently, there are more Massey Ferguson tractors than any other, worldwide.

Models

Massey Ferguson developed a wide range of agricultural vehicles and have a large share in the market across the world especially in Europe. The company's first mass-produced tractor was the Ferguson TE-20, with a petrol engine, which was quickly replaced by the Diesel 20. In 1958 the MF35, the first Massey Ferguson branded tractor (a Ferguson design) rolled off the factory floor. These tractors were massively popular and sold across the UK, Australia, Ireland and the United States. These were followed by other early models like the 65(MK1 indirect injection) 65(MK2 direct injection) 
The next big selling model was the MF135, widely popular because of its reliability and power compared with other tractors at the time. This was the first model in the MF 100 series. These included the MF 135, 145, 148, 150, 165, 168, 175, 178, 180, 185 and 188. These include the MF 1080, 1100, 1130 and 1150. Later came the MF 550, 560, 565, 575, 590, 595(500 series). From the mid-1970s and early 1980s came the 200 series tractor, which included the MF 230, 235, 240, 245, 250, 255, 260, 265, 270, 275, 278, 280, 285, 290, 298, 299.
In the mid-1980s, the short-lived 600 series was released. This included the 675, 690, 690T, 695, 698 and 699. The reason for poor sale was due to poor looks and cab awkwardness compared to its predecessors. In the late 1980s, one of the greatest selling tractors of all time was released- the 300 series Massey Ferguson. Excellent power, simplicity of cab, high range of gears and components made the MF 300 series a success especially in Europe. The range included the MF 350,362,375,390, 390T, 393, 394, 395, 398, and the most powerful and popular Massey Ferguson 399 with horsepower ranging from 72HP to 104HP.
In the mid-1990s, the 6100 series and 8100 series were released, including the 6150, 6180 and 8130.

Today

Tractors that came after the 300 series included the 4200 range, the 4300 range, 3600 (early 1990s), 3000/3100 (early to mid-1990s), 3005/3105 (mid-1990s), 6100 (late 1990s), 6200 (late 1990s/early 2000s (decade)), 8200 (late 1990s/early 2000s (decade)), 5400  (present), 6400 (present), 7400 (present), 8400 (present), and 8600 (present).
AGCO/Massey factories build tractors for Challenger, Iseki and AGCO.
In June 2012, the Agco facility in Jackson, Minnesota, was expanded to start building Massey Ferguson models for the North American market.
Massey Ferguson has become famous amongst sports fans in Spain, thanks to an advertisement regularly run on the radio program Carrusel Deportivo. In it, the host Pepe Domingo Castaño relates its many qualities and awards before singing a Corrido about the tractor.
