Mary Harney (born 11 March 1953) is a former Irish politician. She served as Tánaiste from 1997 to 2006, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment from 1997 to 2004, and as Minister for Health and Children from 2004 to 2011. She also served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin Mid–West and Dublin South–West constituencies from 1981 to 2011.
She was leader of the Progressive Democrats party between 1993 and 2006 and again from 2007 to 08. She resumed her role as leader in 2007 after her successor, Michael McDowell, lost his seat at the 2007 general election. She is the longest ever serving female member of Dáil Éireann.

Early life

Harney was born in Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, County Galway in 1953. Her parents, who lived in nearby Ahascragh, were both farmers but her family moved to Newcastle, County Dublin shortly after her birth. She was educated at the Convent of Mercy, Inchicore and Presentation Convent, Clondalkin before studying at Trinity College, Dublin.
During her time at university, she made history by becoming the first female auditor of the College Historical Society. In 1976, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in General Studies and for a brief time was a secondary school teacher at Castleknock College in Dublin.

Political career

Fianna Fáil

Harney came to the attention of Fianna Fáil leader Jack Lynch and stood unsuccessfully as a Fianna Fáil candidate in the 1977 general election. She was then appointed to Seanad Éireann by Lynch who had become Taoiseach.
In 1979, Harney had her first electoral success when she was elected to Dublin County Council. Two years later she was elected to the Dáil at the 1981 general election for Dublin South–West.

Progressive Democrats

Harney went on to become a founder-member of the Progressive Democrats with Desmond O'Malley and Bobby Molloy in December 1985.
In 1989, the Progressive Democrats entered into a coalition government with Haughey's Fianna Fáil party. Harney was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for Environmental Protection. As Minister of State, she legislated to ban the sale of bituminous coal in Dublin, thereby eliminating smog from the city. She served in this position until the party withdrew from government in late 1992. In February 1993, Harney was appointed Deputy leader of the Progressive Democrats and succeeded O'Malley as party leader in October of that year.

In government

Following the 1997 general election and lengthy negotiations, the Progressive Democrats entered into coalition government with Fianna Fáil. Harney was appointed the first female Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
Following the 2002 general election Harney led the Progressive Democrats, who had doubled their seats from four to eight, back into coalition with Fianna Fáil, the first time a government had been re-elected since 1969. She was re-appointed Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In a government reshuffle on 29 September 2004, she was appointed Minister for Health and Children.
Harney was Ireland's representative to the European Council of Ministers for the Software Patents Directive.
In December 2001, Harney used a Government plane,
In May 2006, the Irish Nurses Organisation unanimously passed a motion of no confidence in Mary Harney, accusing her of being negative and antagonistic towards nurses.
In March 2006, 16 months after she took office as health minister, the INO claimed that a record number of 455 people were waiting on hospital trolleys on one day (although the Health Service Executive gave a figure of 363 people waiting on hospital trolleys for the same day). However, in the same survey conducted a year later, the Irish health service showed significant improvement, coming 16th out of 29 countries. Ireland even scored higher than Britain's NHS which came 17th in the survey.
In July 2006, Ireland on Sunday reported that Mary Harney's mother, Mrs Sarah Harney, jumped a queue of two emergency cases to receive hip surgery at The Adelaide and Meath Hospital in Tallaght. The allegation was strongly denied by the minister.
In July and August 2006, she issued three orders exempting two new community nursing units, to be built at St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park, from the usual legally required planning permission, despite the Park being a designated and protected national monument. The Department of Health said the decision was made because of what it called the department's "emergency response to the accident and emergency crisis at the time", although the nursing units, in use since 2008, are mainly for geriatric care.
The same year, in her capacity as Minister for Health, Mary Harney introduced risk equalisation into the Irish healthcare market. This was hugely resisted by BUPA. However, despite High Court proceedings, the controversial law was upheld. This forced BUPA out of the Irish healthcare market (BUPA Ireland was since bought by the Irish owned Quinn Group, averting any fear of redundancies). In January 2007, a leaked memo said that the planned Cancer Care Strategy, due for completion in 2011, would not be delivered on time. Harney denied this and said that since the leaking of the memo there had been much progress, although she did not elaborate. The plan was to allow for nationwide radiotherapy services by 2011.

Resignation as party leader

On 7 September 2006, Mary Harney announced that she was resigning as leader of the Progressive Democrats and that she would remain leader until a successor was chosen. She said she wanted to continue as Minister for Health

2007 election aftermath

Following the poor performance of the Progressive Democrats at the 2007 general election in which the party lost 6 of its 8 seats, including that of party leader Michael McDowell, Harney resumed her role as party leader. The Progressive Democrats' rules at the time stipulated that the leader of the party must be a TD, and since Harney was one of only two remaining TDs, she resumed the leadership in a caretaker capacity. Following a rule change that broadened the eligibility, she was succeeded by Senator Ciarán Cannon as party leader on 17 April 2008.
When the Progressive Democrats voted to disband in November 2008, Harney said she would remain as an independent TD once the party was wound up.
She did not stand for re-election at the 2011 general election.

=Death threat 2008=

Letters containing death threats and shotgun cartridges, from a group calling itself the Irish Citizens Defence Force, were mailed to Harney, Micheál Martin, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and to officials at two prominent Dublin fertility clinics on 29 February 2008.

=FÁS expenditure controversy=

It emerged in November 2008, that Harney personally requested the use of the Government jet for a FÁS trip to Florida in 2004, at a cost of up to €80,000 to taxpayers. She travelled to Florida with senior FÁS executives, department officials, and her husband, Brian Geoghegan, and was receiving more than €100-a-day subsistence money from the taxpayer when FÁS picked up her hairdressing bill in a Florida hotel. Like all government ministers travelling abroad, she was entitled to a daily allowance for "incidental expenses".
In a RTÉ Radio 1 interview on 27 November 2008, Fianna Fáil TD Mary O'Rourke described Harney's involvement in the scandal as "a load of hoo-hah". On 28 November 2008, Harney defended her use of expenses while on a FÁS trip to the US, saying that she was "not on holiday", had not used public taxes for her own personal grooming, said the use of the government jet for the trip was made by the Taoiseach, and had followed advice in claiming her expenses. She acknowledged meeting a relative for an hour while in the United States. The Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore told his party conference that Harney should resign because of her performance as Minister for Health.

2010 attacks

Harney was attacked with red paint on 1 November 2010 as she turned the sod on a new health centre beside the Cherry Orchard Hospital in Ballyfermot.
Harney's car was attacked with eggs and cheese on 12 November 2010 as she arrived in Nenagh. Her "ongoing downgrading of the hospital" was to blame.

Libel cases

In May 2011 Harney received a €450,000 payout from Newstalk radio in compensation for a slur made about her on live air by journalist Nell McCafferty. In 2002 she settled a libel case with Magill magazine for around €25,000 and in 2004 she settled a case against the Sunday Independent for €70,000, donating both sums to Peamount Hospital, Newcastle, County Dublin.

Retirement

On 15 January 2011, Harney tendered her resignation as Minister for Health and Children to Taoiseach Brian Cowen. She also stated that she would not be contesting the 2011 general election. Harney retired with a package worth more than €300,000 and is entitled to an annual pension of over €120,000. She receives an annual ministerial pension of over €70,000 and a TDs pension of €50,600. She also received a pension lump sum of €160,000, a termination lump sum of about €17,000 and monthly termination payments from the Oireachtas during her first 12 months of retirement worth another €66,900.
She receives annual pension payments of €129,805.

=Board memberships=

In 2012 Harney joined the board of a new healthcare company, Cara. In her first interview since leaving office, Harney said she joined the board of two Irish 'high-potential' start-ups, Cara Health and Ward Biotech. She is also enjoying the speaking engagement circuit. She said: "I spoke at a recent surgeons' conference in New York on my experience as a health minister and in Berlin on the Irish pharma sector." In April 2012 Harney joined the board of car fleet insurer Euro Insurances, an Irish subsidiary of Dutch insurance giant Leaseplan. Indian pharma tycoon Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, appointed Harney to the board of Biocon, a Bangalore-based company employing 7,000 and expanding in Malaysia.

Personal life

In November 2001, Harney married Brian Geoghegan, a businessman, in a low-key afternoon ceremony in Dublin on a day in which she attended to a number of significant political meetings.
