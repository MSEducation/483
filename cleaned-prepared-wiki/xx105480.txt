Kevin Martin McBride (born 5 May 1973 in Clones, County Monaghan) is an Irish boxer,McBride's Boxing Record boxrec.
McBride debuted in December 1992, with a victory against Gary Charlton. In 1997, he defeated Paul Douglas to win the All-Ireland Heavyweight Title, and in 2002 he defeated Craig Tomlinson to add the IBC Americas Heavyweight Title. McBride currently resides in the heavily Irish neighborhood of Dorchester in Boston and trains in nearby Brockton, Massachusetts.
McBride's career-defining performance was a victory over Mike Tyson, former undisputed world heavyweight champion, via a 6th-round TKO on June 11, 2005 When Tyson quit the fight by informing the referee that he would not be able to continue to round Seven in the MCI Center in Washington, D.C.net - Retrieved: 14 July 2007 The aged Tyson explained in a post fight interview that his heart wasn't into the sport anymore.espn.go.com - Retrieved: 11 May 2009 Tyson announced his retirement after the bout, saying "I'm not going to disrespect the sport anymore by losing to this caliber of fighter".
McBride has suffered six losses by knockout—including twice against fighters with losing records. Since his fight with Mike Tyson, McBride beat Byron Polley, then suffered three upset losses. The first loss was against Mike Mollo, a second-round knockout loss. The second loss was against Andrew Golota, a sixth round technical knockout loss after Golota skillfully worked a cut he had opened up over McBride's eye. After three years inactivity, McBride, the 'Clones Colossus', attempted a comeback in an eight rounder on July 10, 2010 at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center in Poughkeepsie, New York, but lost every round-and the bout-in an upset to cruiserweight veteran Zack Page, a journeyman with a losing record as a professional.

On April 9, 2011 McBride fought former cruiserweight and light heavyweight world champion Tomasz Adamek for the IBF International Heavyweight and NABO Heavyweight Championship belts at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. Adamek won a 12 round unanimous decision.
His most recent defeat was on July 29th, 2011 against Polish boxer Mariusz Wach, during a boxing gala held at Mohegan Sun Casino, Uncasville, Connecticut. It was Mcbride's third consecutive defeat against a Polish boxer, having lost earlier to Andrzej Gołota and Tomasz Adamek. It is speculated that McBride will announce the end of his boxing career.
McBride's nickname, "The Clones Colossus", recalls Barry McGuigan's sobriquet "The Clones Cyclone".
