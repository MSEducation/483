Eufaula is the largest city in Barbour County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2010 census the city's population was 13,137.

History

The site along the Chattahoochee River that is now modern-day Eufaula was occupied by three Creek tribes, including the Eufaulas.
The Creeks signed the Treaty of Washington in 1826, ceding most of their land in Georgia and eastern Alabama to the United States,
By the mid 1830s downtown Irwinton was platted out and development was well underway.
In 1850 secessionists in the town formed a vigilante committee which terrorised any White people who had abolitionist sympathies. Thus captain
Elisha Bett was driven from the town and only returned after he had signed a written agreement not to express his views again. 
By the late 1850s, Eufaula's advantageous location on the Chattahoochee made it a major shipping center for cargo bound for the Port of Apalachicola and, from there, to major world markets such as Liverpool and New York City.

The Civil War in Eufaula

Very little is known about the history of Eufaula during the American Civil War because very few contemporary records or newspapers survive.
The CSA operated a military hospital in Eufaula during the conflict.
Montgomery was captured on April 12 and governor Thomas H. Watts, with other state officials, fled to Eufaula,
By May 1965 the Daily Intelligencer of Atlanta reported that 10,000 Union troops had occupied Eufaula.

Reconstruction in Eufaula

By August 1865 cotton shipping out of Eufaula was increasing again, mostly in barter for household goods, which were arriving by ship in increasing quantities.
In March 1867, the United States Congress passed the first of four Reconstruction Acts and the Reconstruction Era began in earnest.  Alabama, and therefore Eufaula, was placed in the Third Military District under the command of General John Pope.  By the time the first elections were held under the new regime, in October 1867, Barbour County had about 5000 registered voters, with about 1500 white and 3500 black.  
Municipal elections were held in March, 1870 and white candidates won all offices except for the two fourth (of four) ward positions as aldermen, which were won by black candidates Washington Burke and Melvin Patterson.  According to the Mobile Register, Keills's "election turned upon sectional differences.  The negroes made their usual noisy demonstrations,  marching in from the country with fife and drum."
In 1874, members of the White League instigated the Election Riot of 1874 in Eufaula, killing at least seven black Republicans, injuring at least 70 more, and preventing over 1,000 others from voting.

=Eufaula Baptists during reconstruction=

Prior to the civil war both black and white Southern Baptists had worshipped in the same churches.  By 1866 there was a general movement of black Baptists to separate from the white churches and form their own congregations.  This process went smoothly in Eufaula, with black Baptists applying to the integrated church for permission to separate in May 1866.  The permission was granted, and, after negotiations, the black Baptists were allowed to purchase an old church building to house their own congregation.

Civil rights years

=The Eufaula housing case=

For a number of years after the United States Supreme Court's monumental 1954 decision Brown v. Board of Education, which overturned Plessy v. Ferguson by declaring racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, the schools in Eufaula remained unintegrated.  The residents of the neighborhood, surrounded on all sides by white areas, thought that the city's motive was actually to keep their children out of a newly built high school once the now-inevitable racial integration occurred.
In 1958 civil rights attorneys Fred Gray and Constance Baker Motley filed a suit in the U.S. District court claiming that their clients' constitutional rights were being violated by the plan.  The federal case was dismissed, but Gray (now appearing without Motley) appealed to the Alabama Circuit Court, where the case was heard by then-judge George Wallace. As before, Gray claimed that since the new development would allow white residents only, their civil rights were being violated by the City.  Although his appeal of the constitutional issue was unsuccessful, Gray also appealed the city's valuations of his clients' properties and, arguing before all-white juries in Wallace's court, managed in most of the cases to win much higher prices.

=The Voting Rights Act of 1965=

After the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 the United States Department of Justice sent federal observers into 24 southern counties to enforce its provisions regarding voter registration for the Fall 1965 elections.  Many of these counties saw a significant increase in black registration, but Eufaula, not having federal supervision, had comparatively low rates.  For instance, on August 16, 1965, 600 black citizens waited in line at the County courthouse in Eufaula to register, but by the time the office closed, only 265 had managed to fill out the paperwork.
In 1966 the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) responded by appointing a local Eufaulan, Daddy Bone, to organize voter registration drives in Eufaula.  Bone initiated a series of nonviolent protests and boycotts of local stores that refused to hire blacks which attracted SNCC supporters from around the Southeastern United States.  The city of Eufaula, under some pressure from the businessmen whose stores were targeted, passed anti-picketing laws and began arresting demonstrators en masse for violating them.  Bone brought in civil rights lawyer S.S. Seay to defend the protestors, who were mostly convicted, and in such numbers as to overwhelm the county jail.

=School integration=

In July 1968 the United States Department of Justice filed suit against 76 Alabama school districts, including the city of Eufaula's, in an attempt to bring them into compliance with Brown v. Board of Education.
Schools in Eufaula remained segregated by race until around 1970.  After integration began the school stopped sponsoring social events, such as proms although unofficial segregated events were still held.  By 1990, students at Eufaula High School had begun pressuring school officials to allow them to hold integrated proms, and the first such was held in 1991 without incident.

Other recent history

In 1963, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers created Lake Walter F. George (unofficially named Lake Eufaula) behind the lock and dam of Fort Gaines, Georgia, once again assuring Eufaula's importance as an inland port.
In the early 1960s, the United States Coast Guard set up an Aids to Navigation Team in Eufaula that is still active today servicing from Columbus, GA to Apalachicola, FL and the Flint River.
In 1964, the Eufaula National Wildlife Refuge was established along Lake Walter F. George to serve and protect many endangered and threatened species such as the American Bald Eagle, the American Alligator, the wood stork and the peregrine falcon.  The refuge is a major tourist attraction for visitors from around the country.
