San Francisco 49ers (2008-present)

On August 31, 2008, Brooks was claimed off waivers by the San Francisco 49ers. The team released linebacker Dontarrious Thomas to make room for Brooks. The 49ers waived Brooks on November 29 to make room for wide receiver Chris Hannon, but re-signed Brooks on December 2 after Hannon was waived.

On December 2, 2009, San Francisco 49ers head coach Mike Singletary mentioned that Brooks would be used increasingly during pass rushing situations.  In week 14, Brooks recorded single-game career-highs of 3 sacks and 2 forced fumbles against the Arizona Cardinals.
Brooks recorded career highs in both tackles (50) and sacks (7) during the 2011 Regular Season. He led the 49ers into the postseason where they would lose to the New York Giants in the NFC Championship.
