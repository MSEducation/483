Ulkadal

'''Novel by George Onakkoor
(Synopsis)'''
Rahulan, the chief protagonist of the novel comes across as a romantic & poet. The novel unveils as he reaches the city from his village and joins college for his PG. The loner Rahulan becomes friends with Davis & Jayasahankar. As the friendship grows, Rahulan also gets close with Reena, Davis's sister. Romance unfolds and it was only natural that Reena, the budding painter and Rahulan the poet were attracted to each other. 
But both brother - who had also found love in Susanna - and sister are wary about the profound presence of an orthodox father, James who will never approve his children finding soul mates outside their religion. Remember the Novel is set in 70's Kerala where religion and caste boundaries were sacrosanct. 
The sudden twist in the story comes as fate becomes villain and Davis dies in a Motorbike accident leaving his sweetheart, Susanna astray.  Rahulan gets a job as college lecturer and his heart still longs for Reena. James who could not bear the death of his only son turns a heart patient and Rahulan is forced to leave behind his unfulfilled love.
Time moves on and we see Rahulan nursing his broken heart and living a life in despair. 
Enter Meera, the student who falls in love with her lecturer. She uses her cunningness and outspoken nature to get him close and in very less time their romance becomes the talk of the town. 
Destiny had something else in store; Rahulan meets Susanna again, but this time as Prof Paul's daughter in law! Rahulan comes to know about Susanna's brother's wedding plans with none other than Reena. 
Rahulan gets engaged to Meera. There is little he could do as he lets himself to be a puppet in fate's hands.  As he reaches home form his engagement he is surprised to see Reena who has come to him leaving behind her home. Rahulan is caught between his love for Reena and engagement to Meera. The Novel reaches climax as Meera's father encounters Rahulan & Reena together, leaves the scene calling off the engagement.
Rahulan wastes no time and welcomes Reena into his life.
Ulkadal written by George Onakkoor was adapted into a movie with the same name and won accolades as the first ever movie in India fully based out of college campus. Ulkadal was the trend setter for a series of campus movies, a genre successfully explored by many film makers later in Indian cinema.
