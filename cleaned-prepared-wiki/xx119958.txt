History

This affiliate company was delisted from NASDAQ effective February 20, 2009.

Bankruptcy

In July 2008, SemGroup ran into liquidity problems and warned that it may have to file for bankruptcy as part of a financial restructuring. Adding to SemGroup's troubles, hedge funds run by Alerian Capital Management and Elliot Associates exercised the terms of a secured loan made to SemGroup and took over the general partnership interest in SemGroup Energy Partners LP. On July 22, 2008, Semgroup, LP filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware.com "Did Goldman Goose Oil?" - March 25, 2009   The company listed both debts and assets of more than $1Â billion.
New York billionaire John Catsimatidis then became engaged in efforts to take over SemGroup, and he gained control over a majority of the company's management committee. He was met by opposition from the company's existing management, who argued for selling off at least some of the company's assets, while Catsimatidis stated his intention to keep the company together.  On February 11, 2009 Catsimatidis was sued by a group of SemGroup executives, seeking removal of Catsimatidis and his allies from the committee."SemGroup executives sue Catsimatidis; SemGroup Energy Partners also warns of asphalt meltdown", Tulsa World, February 11, 2009.  In turn, the company and its unsecured creditors committee sued former CEO Tom Kivisto and former CFO Gregory C. Wallace, seeking return of $362 million that they claim the defendants used for their own transactions and benefits.
In April, 2009, former FBI director Louis Freeh released a report on the circumstances surrounding the SemGroup bankruptcy.tulsaworld.pdf
In July, Catsimatidis and the company reached a settlement, pursuant to which Catsimatidis acquired a piece of SemGroup's asphalt business and dropped his competing plan for the company's proposed reorganization."Catsimatidis to support SemGroup reorganization", Reuters, July 20, 2009.

Recovery

On December 1, 2009, SemGroup exited bankruptcy under a new corporate structure, eliminating its master limited partnership and becoming a publicly traded company focused on asphalt manufacture and marketing and on oil and natural gas storage and transport, with about 140 employees in Tulsa and 1,000 overall.  On the same day, the former SemGroup Energy Partners LP adopted a new name, Blueknight Energy Partners LP; Blueknight is now separate in ownership and assets (although sharing a pipeline system with SemGroup).

Meanwhile, global oil trader Vitol Group took control of Blueknight (the former SemGroup Energy Partners LP). In  October 2010, Vitol made a deal to add Charlesbank Capital Partners as a second general partner; this led to public charges, by an investment fund associated with billionaire Michael Dell, that the transaction was improper self-dealing intended to take money from Blueknight's existing limited partners.  Vitol denied these charges.Rod Walton, "Blueknight investor attacks restructuring deal", Tulsa World, December 21, 2010.
