[[Al-Dawayima]]

CATEGORIES: Arab villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, District of Hebron

Al-Dawayima () was a Palestinian town, located in the former Hebron Subdistrict of Mandatory Palestine, and in what is now the Lachish region, some 15 kilometres south-east of Kiryat Gat. 
It has been occasionally identified with the Old Testament town of Bosqat, the home of Josiah's mother Jedidah (2 Kings, 22:1) though the association has not found widespread acceptance. Groves, 'Boskath', in David Noel Freedman, (ed.) Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible,  Wm B.198. According to a 1945 census, the town's population was 3,710, and the village lands comprised a total land area of 60,585 dunums of which nearly half was cultivable. The population figures for this town also included the populations of nearby khirbets, or ancient villages. During the 1948 Palestine war, the al-Dawayima massacre occurred in which an estimated 80 - 200 civilian men, women and children were killed.

History

Al-Dawayima's historical remains encompass a long period from the Bronze Age, through to the Persian and Hellenistic, down to the Ottoman period. Bulldozing what remains of the Palestinian village to prepare a new Israeli village has revealed an ancient olive press, a columbarium cave,  a villa from the Second Temple era, and both mikvehs and cisterns.
The "core clan" of Al-Dawayima were the Ahdibs, who traced their origin to the Muslim conquest and settlement of Palestine in the seventh century.Morris, 2004, p 469
In the late nineteenth century, al-Dawayima was described as a village on a high stony ridge that had olive groves beneath it. On a higher ridge to the west stood a shrine that was topped by a white stone.258. Also quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 213.
The people of al-Dawayima were Muslims. They maintained several religious shrines, chief among them the shrine of Shaykh ´Ali. This shrine had a large courtyard, a number of rooms, and one large hall for prayers, and was surrounded by fig and carob trees and cactuses. It attracted visitors from the neighboring villages. 54. Cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 213 A mosque was located in the village center, it was maintained by the followers of al-tariqa  al-khalwatiyya, a Sufi mystic order founded by Shaykh Umar al-Khalwati (d.1397)Glassé, 1989, p. 221. Cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 213 The villagers expanded and renovated the mosque in the 1930s, and added a tall minaret.
By 1944/45 21,191 dunums of village land were allotted to cereals, while 1,206 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards.93Khalidi, 1992, p. 213

1948 War and aftermath

Al-Dawaymima was captured by Israel's Eighty Ninth Battalion (commanded by Dov Chesis) of the 8th Armored Brigade led by the founder of the Palmach, Yitzhak Sadeh, after Operation Yoav on 29 October 1948, five days after the start of the truce. It was the site of the al-Dawayima massacre in which 80-200 civilians were killed including women and children.
The massacre was cited by Yigal Allon as the reason for the halting of the creeping annexation that included Bayt Jibrin, Qubeiba and Tel Maresha. Yigal Allon; Native Son; A Biography Translated by Evelyn Abel, University of Pennsylvania Press ISBN 978-0-8122-4028-3 p 248
The massacre was seen as a reprisal by the Israelis for the massacre of Jews in Kfar Etzion months before, on May 13, 1948, by Palestinian fighters and some members of the Arab Legion. 469 and Benny Morris (2008), 1948: An History the First Arab-Israeli War, p. 333.
The nearby Jewish town of Amatzya is located on lands belonging to Al-Dawayima.215 According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi : "The site has been fenced in. A cowshed, a chicken coop, and granaries have been built at its center (which has been leveled). The southern side of the site contains stone terraces and the remnants of a house. The eastern side is occupied by the residential area of the moshav." 
In 2013, the whole area, apart from some ancient Jewish remains, was bulldozed to pave the way for the erection of a new community, to be named Karmei Katif, which is planned to house evacuees of the Gaza Strip settlements. The new name is reminiscent of Gush Katif.

Culture

A woman's thob (loose fitting robe with sleeves) dated to about 1910 that was produced in Al-Dawayima is part of the Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA) collection at Santa Fe. The dress is of hand-woven blue indigo linen. The embroidery is in predominantly red silk cross-stitch, with touches of violet, orange, yellow, white, green and black. The upper half of the qabbeh (the square chest panel) is embroidered with alternating columns of diamonds, (a pattern known as el-ferraneh), and eight-pointed stars, (called qamr ("moons")). The lower half of the qabbeh is in the qelayed ("necklaces") pattern. The side-panels of the skirt are completely covered with embroidered columns. Among the patterns used here are: nakhleh ("palm") motif, ward-wil-aleq ("rose-and-leech") and khem-el-basha ("the pashas tent"). Each column is topped with various trees. There is no embroidery on the long, pointed sleeves. 56-57
The village is often featured in the works of Palestinian artist Abdul Hay Mosallam who was expelled from it in 1948.
