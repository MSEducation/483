Estelle Morris, Baroness Morris of Yardley, PC (born 17 June 1952) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Yardley from 1992 to 2005, and served briefly in the Cabinet as Education Secretary.

Early life

Morris was born in Manchester to a political family. Her uncle, Alf Morris, was Labour MP for Manchester Wythenshawe (1964–97) and her father, Charles, was Labour MP for Manchester Openshaw (1963–83) and Post Office union official who married Pauline Dunn. She first attended Rack House primary school on Yarmouth Drive in Wythenshawe (now part of the borough of Manchester). She went to Whalley Range Grammar School for Girls (became the comprehensive  Whalley Range High School in 1967) on Wilbraham Road in Whalley Range where she failed her English and French A-levels. 
She is a graduate of the Coventry College of Education (merged with the University of Warwick in 1979 to become the Warwick Institute of Education), where she gained a BEd in 1974. Morris remembered the long-serving Principal, Joan Dillon Browne (1912-2009), as "a pioneer in showing what women could achieve, long before it was fashionable to do so." Morris was a PE and Humanities teacher at the inner-city Sidney Stringer School on Cox Street in Coventry from 1974–92, becoming Head of Sixth Form Studies, and was a member of Warwick District Council from 1979 to 1991.

Parliamentary career

Morris was elected to Parliament in 1992 for Birmingham Yardley, gaining the seat from the Conservatives with only a wafer-thin majority of 162. She became a minister in the Department for Education and Employment in 1997 and was promoted to Secretary of State for Education and Skills in 2001. She was the first (former) comprehensive school teacher to have the position. She suddenly resigned her post in October 2002, explaining that she did not feel up to the job.  She had made a commitment to the then Conservative Shadow Education Secretary, David Willetts to resign if the literacy and numeracy targets were not met.(Hansard – 2 March 1999 : Column 948) In interviews following her resignation she stated that she had felt happier and more effective as a junior Education minister.
She rejoined the Government in 2003 as Minister for the Arts in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and caused further comment when she admitted that she did not know much about contemporary art. She stepped down from the government and as a Member of Parliament at the 2005 general election.
On 13 May 2005 it was announced that she would be created a life peer,
