Anuj Dhar is an Indian author and former journalist. Dhar is also the founder-trustee of New Delhi based not for profit organisation Mission Netaji.
Dhar and Mission Netaji investigate the claims that Bose lived in the Uttar Pradesh state of India as a hermit till 1985.  
In 2005, the Taiwan government provided emails to Dhar that it has no records of a plane crash during the period of August 14 to October 25, 1945, at the old Matsuyama Airport (now Taipei Domestic Airport).
The scholarly view is that Bose died in the air crash and that theories that he did not are incorrect,  speculative, mythical, and possibly fabricated 
In the book No Secrets, Dhar claims that, according to a newspaper article published by Bose's elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose in The Nation, Bose was in China in October 1949.  
Dhar's 2008 book, CIA's Eye on South Asia, compiled declassified Central Intelligence Agency records on India and its neighbors.
