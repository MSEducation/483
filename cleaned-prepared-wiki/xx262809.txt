Roy Herman "Squib" Torbet (August 21, 1889 â€“ February 1974) was an American football player.  He played at the end and fullback positions for the Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1910 to 1913. He developed a reputation as an excellent forward passer and was one of the earliest Michigan players to have success as a passer.

Early years

A native of Detroit, Michigan, Torbet attended the Detroit public schools.  He attended Detroit Central High School and was a star of the school's football teams in 1908 and 1909.  After the 1908 season, the school's yearbook noted that Torbet's "sensational playing was a bright feature of every game."  He was unanimously selected as the captain of the school's 1909 football team.

University of Michigan

Torbet graduated from high school in 1910 and enrolled at the University of Michigan.  He was a reserve on Michigan's football team in 1910,(started four games at end, and two at fullback in 1913)  The Wolverines compiled a record of 16-4-2 in Torbet's three years as a starter.
Torbet was one of the earliest Michigan Wolverines football players to have success as a forward passer.  The forward pass was not legalized until 1906,Cross, Harry, "Inventing the Forward Pass", November 1, 1913, reprinted in "This Day in Sports", The New York Times, November 1, 2004  
Two years before Dorais and Rockne popularized the passing game, Torbet developed a reputation as one of the game's best forward passers.  The Detroit Free Press wrote that, in 1911, "his long forward passes were largely instrumental in bringing Michigan her victory."  In the final game of the 1912 season, on fourth down with seven yards to go in the fourth quarter, Torbet threw a touchdown pass to Miller Pontius to give Michigan the lead against Cornell; Michigan won the game 20-7. 
At the end of the 1912 season, Torbet was selected by Fielding H. Yost as a first-team player on his All-Western team.
In early 1913, Torbet announced plans to leave the university, stating that he was not satisfied with the results of his last semester's examinations.  However, in late February 1913, he announced that he had reconsidered his decision and would return to the football team in the fall of 1913.  The Detroit Free Press reported: "It seems that the forward-passing end was a bit hasty in making up his mind to leave and that when the matter was gone into carefully it was found that he was not in bad shape at all scholastically."  
As a senior in 1913, he was moved to the fullback position where he continued to develop a reputation as an effective forward passer. 

Later years

Torbet graduated from the University of Michigan in 1914.  In September 1914, he was reportedly hired to teach and coach football at the Colorado School of Mines.
Torbet lived in Northville, Michigan in his later years.  He died in February 1974 at age 84.
