Biography

Cremin was a student of Somerville High School.

Murder

On March 29, 1995, Deanna Cremin followed her usual Wednesday routine of going out with friends and visiting her boyfriend.  Her curfew was 10 pm; when she was not home by midnight, her mother tried unsuccessfully to reach her on her pager. Her boyfriend, considered the last person to see Cremin alive, admits walking her home that night, but says he left her halfway, as he often had during their year-long courtship."'Everybody loved her' Somerville shocked by murder of girl, 17", by David Weber and Beverly Ford, Boston Herald, March 31, 1995, page 1."Anguish drives mom's quest for daughter's killer 'I will not let this go'", by Beverly Ford, Boston Herald, September 24, 1995, page 15.
Cremin's body was found at 8 a.m. on March 30, behind a senior housing complex, less than a block from her home. She was found by two children she babysat for, taking a shortcut on their way to school."Unsolved slay haunts mother", by Laurel J. Sweet, Somerville Journal, Aug 20, 2006. Retrieved Mar 13, 2010. Her body was lying on its back, and mostly undressed. She had been strangled.

Investigation

Police identified three men as persons of interest in the crime: Cremin's teenage boyfriend; a Somerville firefighter more than twice Cremin's age, said to have been fixated on her; and a third adult man, later imprisoned at Massachusetts Correctional Institution - Cedar Junction."Teen's unsolved slaying weighs heavily on mom", by Peter Gelzinis, Boston Herald, Mar 30, 2005, page 4. But no charges were pressed. In 2005, Middlesex district attorney Martha Coakley announced new forensic evidence had been found with procedures unavailable in 1995, raising hope of progress in the case, but again no charges were pressed."Cremin family still seeks justice for slain daughter", by Erin Dower, Somerville Journal, Mar 29, 2006. Retrieved Mar 14, 2010.
In 2009, current Middlesex district attorney Gerry Leone stated that the murder would be solved, but law enforcement needed witnesses who had remained silent to come forward. The Cremin family erects a billboard each year since her death, to offer a reward for information about the killer. At the bottom of the billboard, a quote reads: "You know what you did to me. How much longer must I wait! Please help make my time in heaven restful." The reward has grown from $10,000 in 1995 to $20,000 by 2005."Billboard touts reward in slay probe", Tom Farmer, Boston Herald, March 31, 2005.
