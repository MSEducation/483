The airport was developed by public-private partnership with Greece holding 55% of the shares.
The airport is designed to be upgraded over the ensuing years in order to accommodate the increase in air travel, and its upgrades are planned in a six-phase framework. The first (current) phase initially allowed the airport to accommodate 16 million passengers a year, but was upgraded to 21 million passengers a year without progressing to the next phase thanks primarily to IT advances. The sixth phase will allow the airport to accommodate as many as 50 million passengers a year. The current runways are designed to accommodate 50 million passengers a year with the completion of the sixth phase.
The airport has received approval from the European Aviation Safety Agency and the Federal Aviation Administration for take-offs and landings of the biggest passenger jet worldwide, the Airbus A380. The first Airbus A380 to visit 'Eleftherios Venizelos' Athens International Airport made an emergency landing on 13 April 2011 as a passenger suffered a heart attack. The first scheduled A380 flight took place on October 26 from Emirates Airlines.
The Financial crisis of 2007–08 severely reduced traffic at the airport. United Airlines, Thai Airways, Gulf Air, Czech Airlines and Singapore Airlines are among the foreign airlines that ended their services to Athens. Delta Airlines terminated its winter scheduled service to New York City in 2012, leaving Greece without a direct connection to the United States for the first time in almost 70 years.

However, 2014 seems to signal a recovery for the airport's passenger traffic. More than ten new airlines started, or are scheduled to start, new flights to and from Athens. AEGEAN Airlines strengthened its destination network by 30% within the last six months and Ryanair established a new base in the Athens Airport. Starting April 1st, Ryanair serves six new destinations and will increase passenger mobility by 25%. Already for the first three months the airport recorded an increase in passenger mobility by 8.4%. Singapore Airlines returns to Athens on June 9th. Similarly, Gulf Air resumes flights on June 16th.net/2014/04/11/gf-ath-jun14/
