When the other prison officers learn of the disease in Larkhall, they madly race out of the building, knocking Joy unconscious and trampling on her. Joy later regains consciousness, and is stunned when she witnesses all of G-Wing's prisoners escaping. They are all ordered back inside the prison, but Phyl is shot when she attempts to run away.
Later on in the series, new inmate Stella Gough (Helen Modern) pleases Joy when she tells her she wants to join the army, and she sustains a nasty fall when she tries to show Joy just how much she wants to be in the army. While she is in the hospital, Stella reveals that she knows Joy is her mother, and Joy is stunned to know that she has been reunited with her daughter. Stella reveals that she knows why Joy gave her up for adoption, she had told Social Services that she was raped, when it was actually a drunken one-night stand. Stella confides in Joy saying that she too was also raped. When Joy sees Stella being attacked by Darlene Cake (Antonia Okonma) and Tina O'Kane (Victoria Bush), she steps in and is punched in the stomach by Darlene. Joy then reveals the awful truth to Stella that she was not raped, and that she just drunkenly had sex while she was in the army. Stella then attacks Joy with a smashed glasses lense attached to a toothbrush, and new prison officer Mandy Goodhue (Angela Bruce) saves her. Joy then takes optional leave when she turns to alcohol for comfort. When she returns, she has to deal with the fact that Janine Nebeski (Nicola Stapleton) has now fallen pregnant. Janine tells Joy that her boyfriend, "Michael", is responsible, but the biological father is in fact prison officer, Donny Kimber (Sid Owen). Joy discovers this and threatens to fire him. When Darlene sets fire to herself on the landing of G-Wing, Donny puts her out and Joy congratulates Donny for his quick-thinking, and she says that he is allowed to keep his job. Joy is not seen after this.

Kevin Spiers

Kevin Spiers was introduced as a replacement for Colin Hedges (Tristan Surrock). Kevin shows many aspects of Jim Fenner (Jack Ellis) in him; having sexual relationships with some of the inmates and turning violent when they take advantage of him. When Fenner is murdered, Kevin becomes a suspect after their friendship became frosty towards the end of his life. The real culprit was in fact Julie Johnston (Kika Mirylees). Kevin begins having sex with nonce Natalie Buxton (Dannielle Brent), but she is only using him for her "weekend out". Kevin is about to escort Natalie on the weekend out, but when the alarms go off following Bev Tull (Amanda Barrie) and Phyl Oswyn's (Stephanie Beacham) escapes, it is postponed. When the weekend out eventually arrives, Natalie and Kevin have sex yet again, but things turn sour when she sprays Kevin in the eyes with a can of deodorant, and she plans to make her great escape. Unfortunately for Natalie, new G-Wing Top Dog Pat Kerrigan (Liz May Brice) has organised a mob to be waiting outside her hotel to attack her, and she is slapped across the face. Kevin then saves Natalie and their relationship begins yet again. When in the chapal, Kevin and Natalie are caught having anal sex by Chaplain. Christy Mackay (Gaynor Howe). Kevin orders for Natalie to stop Christy from telling Larkhall Governor Joy Masterton (Ellie Haddington), so she manipulates mentally ill inmate Miranda Miles (Nicola Redmond) into murdering Christy with a sharpened cross. When Kevin and Joy find Christy's corpse in the shower, they immediately send Miranda to a psychiatric hospital. Kevin is last seen looking worried after Natalie tells him that she manipulated Miranda into killing Christy.

Lou Stoke

Louise "Lou" Stoke is hired as Deputy Governor of Larkhall to help out Joy Masterton (Ellie Haddington). She instantly makes herself noticed by the inmates, and has a kind and sensitive side to her. Joy bad-mouts Wing Governor Neil Grayling (James Gaddas) to Lou, unaware that Neil and Lou already know each other. Lou is later stunned when she finds Neil dead on the floor of his office following the sudden outbreak of Legionnaires' disease. Following the prisoners' escape after the sudden outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, Lou and Dr. Rowan Dunlop (Colin Salmon) help Tina O'Kane (Victoria Bush) as she is seriously ill after catching the disease. In the next episode, Lou and Rowan get much closer and end up having sex in the bathroom. New disturbing inmate Angela Robbins (Annette Badland) shows signs of dissociative identity disorder, and when Lou is escorting her to Rowan's office for a health check-up, Angela attacks Lou violently. After Lou punches Angela across the face, she begins to show a more caring and frightened side to her. Rowan diagnoses Angela with dissociative identity disorder and the pair have her shipped out of Larkhall. Lou then meets a young woman at the gates of Larkhall and they talk about somebody who Lou is close with. It later transpires to be her younger sister, Vicky (Melanie Cameron). Lou finds Vicky at a strip club, where they exchange insults and a catfight erupts between the two. Lou feels embarrassed when she realises that Rowan has witnessed the fight. Later on, Lou invites Rowan to her flat for dinner, to which he gladly accepts. During their meal, Vicky turns up and collapses, and it is soon revealed that she has attempted to commit suicide. When Vicky regains consciousness, she clashes with Lou about the situation and she warns her about Rowan. When Lou discovers that a young girl, Vanessa Andrews, is being used to smuggle drugs into prisons using her vagina, she confronts nonce Natalie Buxton (Dannielle Brent) about it, after Pat Kerrigan (Liz May Brice) grasses her up. Natalie acts as if she knows nothing about Vanessa, so Lou cannot charge her.

Dr. Rowan Dunlop

Dr. Rowan Dunlop makes his first appearance in the first episode of Series 8, as a replacement doctor for the late Dr. Malcolm Nicholson (Philip McGough). When Wing Governor Neil Grayling (James Gaddas) and prisoner Ashley Wilcox (Sandra De Sousa) die mysteriously, and Tina O'Kane (Victoria Bush) falls seriously ill, Rowan diagnoses the outbreak of Legionnaires' disease. All of the prison officers escape, along with some of the prisoners, and only Rowan, Tina, Lou Stoke (Amanda Donohoe) and Pat Kerrigan (Liz May Brice) are left in the building. Outside, Phyl Oswyn (Stephanie Beacham) is shot when she attempts to run away, and Rowan informs her that if the bullet would have gone any deeper into her stomach, she would've died. Phyl pretends to show signs of paranoia, and tells her partner-in-crime Bev Tull (Amanda Barrie) that she is faking her symptoms. They later discover that Rowan is secretly working for a television series called Women Inside, so Phyl and Bev blackmail Rowan into allowing Phyl into going to a professional hospital, otherwise they'll tell Governing Governor Joy Masterton (Ellie Haddington) about his schemes. Rowan gives in and sends Phyl to hospital. Rowan and Lou later get intimate and they have sex in the bathroom of G-Wing. Swiftly after, Rowan witnesses Lou's catfight with her younger sister, Vicky (Melanie Cameron), in a strip club, leaving Lou embarrassed. When Lou invites Rowan to her flat for dinner, he delightedly accepts, and reveals that he is married. During their meal, Vicky arrives and collapses after attempting to commit suicide.  Dr Dunlop gets his comeuppance when Lou finds out that he has been feeding her sister Vicky drugs, and lured her into taking an another overdose.  He was planning on letting her die, but is forced to act when discovered at the last minute.  Vicky confesses all to Lou on the way to hospital, and she returns to Larkhall long enough to smacks him in the head with a paperweight.  She is forced to leave Larkhall by Joy Masters.

Mandy Goodhue

Mandy Goodhue is first seen patrolling around G-Wing as a new prison officer. In the first episode of Series 8, it is clear that she has a good friendship with Sylvia Hollamby (Helen Fraser), and is kind and thoughtful.

Mandy is unaware, however, that she has left all of the doors unlocked and the prisoners make their escape.
