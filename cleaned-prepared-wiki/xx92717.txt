Landmarks

Whalley Viaduct

Known locally as "Whalley Arches", Whalley Viaduct is a 48-span railway bridge crossing the River Calder and a listed structure.
It was built between 1846 and 1850 under the engineering supervison of Terrence Wolfe Flanagan.  It is a red brick arch structure and the longest and largest railway viaduct in Lancashire.3m over the river for 620m.
Over 7 million bricks and 12,338 cubic metres of stone were used in construction. 3,000m of timber were used for the arch centring, temporary platforms and the permanent foundation piles. During construction on 6 October 1849, two of the 41 arches then completed collapsed, with the loss of three lives.
The east side of the bridge, nearest the remains of the Abbey, has the only decorative treatment. Marshall, David and Charles, Newton Abbot

Calder's waterfall and isles

The River Calder has a man-made weir section at Whalley, which supposedly allowed the monks of Whalley Abbey to collect water easily. It has been suggested that was one of the main reasons for the abbey being built where it was. The river here has two small islands made of pebbles and rocks.
The Dam/weir was built to guide water to a channel,that fed a water wheel in the Corn Mill,(there is a sluice gate where the dam meets the channel, this turns the wheel on and off) this gave power to grind the various products (Wheat, Barley etc.).  The power to the Mill was all belt driven through a pulley system.  The Mill has now been transformed into flats, but you can still see the remains of the wheel through an opening at the back of the building.

Shops and amenities

Whalley has many independent shops, hairdressers, numerous take-aways and estate agents, a SPAR minimarket, Lloyds Pharmacy and wine shop. Barclays Bank has a branch on the main street.

The hospital has a burial ground, at the end of which is the Whalley (Queen Mary's Hospital) Cemetery, containing 42 graves of Commonwealth service personnel (primarily military patients) - 33 from World War I and nine from World War II - together with a memorial to nearly 300 servicemen who died in the hospital.

Sport

A local club staged speedway meetings at Dean's Pleasure Grounds in the late 1920s. The track was very small and only two riders were allowed to race at any one time. A contemporary photo  shows the track on flat land adjacent to a river and the showground with a helter-skelter. Today there are sports facilities including tennis courts, football pitches, a bowling green and cricket ground. In 1867, Whalley hosted the first Roses Match between Lancashire County Cricket Club and Yorkshire County Cricket Club at Station Road.
