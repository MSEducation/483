Temelín Nuclear Power Station (, abbreviation JETE) is located near Temelín, a small village in the Czech Republic. Temelín NPP is owned by ČEZ Group, which employs 1000 workers at this site. The adjacent castle Vysoký Hrádek serves as an information centre.
In spring 2003, the Temelín Nuclear Power Plant, with its 2,000 MW of installed capacity, became the largest power resource in the Czech Republic.

History

Planning began in the late 1970s and the final project was submitted in 1985. Construction of four operating units began in 1987. The project was expected to be completed in 1991 with estimated building costs of 35 billion Kčs.
After the Velvet revolution in 1990 the Czechoslovakian government decided to cease construction of the third and fourth reactors.
In 1998 construction still was not completed and costs reached 71 CZK billion. The Czech government again reconsidered completion of the plant. The project was controversial; national and international (mainly Austrian) opposition was stronger than in the early 1990s. In a 1999 opinion poll 47% of Czech citizens were in favor and 53% against nuclear power development. 
As early as 1993 there were local and international protests against the plant's construction. The first reactor was finally commissioned in 2000 and the second in 2002.

Technical data

Most information were taken from ČEZ website

The reactor vessel (active zone)

The reactor contains 163 fuel assemblies. 

A single assembly has the shape of ~4.5m long hexagonal and inside are 312 fuel rods and 61 control rods.

The fuel rods contain stacked cylindrical fuel pellets. 

Fuel enrichment: max. 4% (average 3.5%) of 235U (fissile isotope)

Fuel load UO2: 92t (The reactor splits about 3 kg of uranium every day)

Fuel Replacement cycle: 4 years (every year 1/4 is changed)

vessel height: ~11m, outside diameter: ~4.5m, wall thickness: 193mm

The vessel is designed for up to 17.6MPa at 350 °C

The vessel is made of high quality, low-alloy chrome-nickel-molybdenum-vanadium steel

For the reactor to produce thermal output 1W, 30 billion fissions of uranium-235 must take place every second. For a coal power station to produce the same output 1,500,000,000 billion carbon atoms must be burned.

Reactor cooling system

Number of cooling loops: 4

Quantity of primary circuit coolant: 337 m3

Operating pressure: 15.7MPa 

Coolant inlet temperature: approx. 290 °C (554F)

Coolant outlet temperature: approx. 320 °C (608F)

Coolant flow through reactor: 23.5 m3/s

Steam generator

Number per reactor block: 4

Steam delivered per one generator: 1470 t/hour

Steam outlet pressure: 6.3MPa

Steam outlet temperature: 278.5 °C (533.3F)

Cooling circuit

The plant has 4 cooling towers (each reactor has 2 towers). Each tower has a height of .
Pure water is evaporated in cooling tower (~0.3m3/s). The water needs to be constantly refilled.

Protective Envelope (containment)

Height of cylindrical section: 38m

Inside diameter of cylindrical section: 45m

Wall thickness: 1.2m

Thickness of steel lining: 8mm

Turbine generator set

Number per production block: 1

Number of steam turbine sections: 1 high pressure + 3 low pressure

Speed: 3000 rpm

Voltage on alternator's terminal: 24KV

Alternator cooling: hydrogen – water

Reliability

The International Atomic Energy Agency data show that Reactor 1 reaches a cumulative operating factor of about 63%, The cumulative operating factor figures for Temelín NPP reactors are lower than the figures of similar reactors operated in Russia, where the cumulative operating factor is around 80-87%.orgKalinin Reactor 3, Iaea.org
ČEZ had increased operating factor and production in recent years and the plant reached 84% in 2012 with a total record production of 15 TWh.Temelín vyrobil v roce 2012 rekordní množství elektřiny

New reactors

Plans to build all four original reactors were reopened in 2005.  However in 2014 the prospective plans were cancelled.
In 2007 planning was suspended because a new government agreed not to promote nuclear energy; a Green Party was a member of the coalition government. However, in July 2008 ČEZ requested the Ministry of the Environment conduct an environmental impact assessment for two additional reactors. In 2009 regional approval was granted for the new build. 
In August 2009, ČEZ sought bids for two pressurized water reactors (PWRs).[ref]

Shortly after the Fukushima nuclear accidents, Prime Minister Petr Nečas announced that the construction of new reactors will continue according to the original plans,
In July 2012 ČEZ opened bids for the public contract for completing the Temelín Nuclear Power Plant in the presence of the bidders' - Areva, a consortium of the Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC and WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC ČR, and a consortium of ŠKODA JS, Atomstroyexport, and Gidropress.
In October 2012 ČEZ informed Areva that they have in their bid failed to meet statutory requirements for building two new units of the Temelín Nuclear Power Plant. Moreover, Areva has not fulfilled some other crucial criteria defined in the tender. Since the award procedure has been conducted in accordance with the Public Procurement Act, Areva's bid had to be excluded from further evaluation.
In March 2013, a Russian led consortium, comprising Atomstroyexport, Gidropress and Skoda, signed contracts with the three Czech companies ZAT, HOCHTIEF CZ and UJV Rez, for the construction, if it wins, of the two new nuclear reactor units for Temelín-3 and Temelín-4. The reactors proposed are the MIR-1200 (Modernised International Reactor).
ZAT will supply automated systems for the plant, HOCHTIEF CZ will be responsible for construction of the nuclear island, and UJV Rez will help compile project documentation for the nuclear and turbine islands, and also create working documentation for construction of the plant. A statement said the consortium is aiming for a "localisation level" of 75 percent.
The other running project for the contract is now Westinghouse with its AP1000 reactor. The winner of the contract is scheduled to be announced at the end of 2013.
In April 2014, CEZ cancelled the project after the Czech government stated it does not plan to provide guarantees or other mechanisms to support the construction of low-emission power plants following discussions in the EU. The CEZ CEO stated:
