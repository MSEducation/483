Role in SpongeBob SquarePants

Sandy is an intelligent, scientific, bipedal anthropomorphic squirrel who resides in Bikini Bottom and is featured as a close friend of SpongeBob SquarePants. She is from Texas and it is for this reason that she is seen speaking in a Southern accent, and is proud of her home state which is frequently brought up throughout the course of the series. While Sandy is normally portrayed as kind, helpful, and understanding, she has been shown to possess a vindictive side too.

Appearance

Sandy is most commonly seen wearing her suit when she is outside her tree dome. The suit is white, and with a yellow patch with an acorn on it (although instead of an acorn it originally had three spots on it). It also has two red, and a blue ring(s) on each sleeve. The suit comes with a big glass dome (but it doesn't have an oxygen tank) with a pink flower.

Development

Voice

The voice of Sandy Cheeks is provided by Carolyn Lawrence,
Before a recording, Lawrence prepares when the crew sends a storyboard. She explains, "I absolutely love that! Not only do I get to read the script, I can actually see what the artists have in mind. It is an amazing process and I feel so fortunate to be able to work that way!... I would prefer to let the script come alive in me before a taping."

Reception

Criticism and controversy

Despite claims by the show's creators that SpongeBob and the rest series' characters are "somewhat asexual", several annuals state that SpongeBob holds romantic feelings for Sandy, which could be shown in examples where SpongeBob brings Sandy flowers on occasion.
Jeffrey P. Dennis, author of the journal article "The Same Thing We Do Every Night: Signifying Same-Sex Desire in Television Cartoons," argued that SpongeBob and Sandy are not romantically in love, while adding that he believed that SpongeBob and Patrick "are paired with arguably erotic intensity." Dennis noted the two are "not consistently coded as romantic partners," since they live in separate residences, and have distinct groups of friends, but claimed that in the series, "the possibility of same-sex desire is never excluded."Dennis, Jeffrey P.
