Brief history

In May 2007, O2 Asia Pacific & Middle East released the XDA Flame. O2's cooperation with nVidia and CodeMonkeys allowed this company to advertise their new product easily, because there was a big demand on the market for a 3D graphics enabled PDA, with a lot of internal memory and many additional functions like USB On-The-Go and TV-out. However, at the end of 2007, O2 began to release new products and they stopped supporting this device, passing all copyrights to a new company called Mobile & Wireless Group (MWg).O2 Asia is dead, long live MWG MWg has released XDA Flame under its own brand with Bluetooth 2.0. Many Flame owners felt a relief knowing that someone will still support their devices. Yet, after a half year, MWg resigned from further supporting this device on its main site and created O2 Asia Support where users can still get a support. In the near future Mwg is planning to release a Flame successor called Flame IIMWg looks to shake-up smartphone market  with probably Windows Phone 7.

Device issues

XDA Flame has several software bugs. From the beginning MWg's support center have not released a new Windows Mobile 6 version since it appeared on the market.
After some time a class action lawsuit page was established to raise awareness of the problem, similar to HTC TyTN II case.MWG/O2 XDA Flame Unfulfilled Promises Class Action LawsuitClass Action Lawsuit main page
 
 (...)"We as customers have the right to demand fixes and support for a device that retailed for around $1500 dollars (expensive to say the least). We will also investigate a possible class action suit against O2 / MWG for this as well as lack of support. The class action law suit will only be a last resort if all else fails and information is  been seeked on such an action at the moment. We hope that MWG shows itself to be the leading edge company it promotes itself to be and this not be necessary. However as of yet we have had only vague promises of Windows Mobile 6 coming to this device. What we ask is that MWG/O2 do as promised and publicly announce that they will "attempt" to fix these issues and deliver Windows Mobile 6. We are all just looking to use what we purchased nothing more."(...) - Osborne T. MWG/O2 XDA Flame Unfulfilled Promises Class Action Lawsuit, 24th March 2008
Battling with the lack of support by MWG and nVidia, community users have repackaged many Windows Mobile ROM images by their own. After several months dealing with some issues (as sleeping beauty, which caused the device not to wake up from suspension; or a long-standing SDHC problem with Wifi), there have aroused stable and fully functionals ROMs including versions with Windows Mobile 6.1 and SDHC.com/viewforum.

Maintenance

To perform soft-reset on XDA Flame - put stylus in a hole next to a microphone.
To perform hard-reset on XDA Flame - while pressing Camera and Comm buttons (two buttons on the left and right at the bottom of the device) soft-reset device. When asked, user should press left soft-key (YES).

OS updating

Operating system (OS) updating, which is also called flashing, is a process similar to installing a new Windows on a PC.
On PDAs, Windows Mobile "disk image" or "ROM image" (archive containing OS files) is installed in internal flash memory.

Registry tweaks

Windows Mobile, like any Windows version, has a Windows registry. TweakingWindows Mobile registry tweaks a registry refers to changing registry entries so that many OS functions will work differently. It's commonly used among Pocket PC users to get the best performance from devices and to get to OS hidden settings.
Known tools for Pocket PC registry editing:
WM registry hives:
Editing WM registry steps:
Most registry entries can be changed by using special . Those can be made with the help of WinCE CAB Manager for PC (for example). An option that allows user to uninstall such cab file should be unchecked.
The second option for quick registry entries import is through . Those are standard .
