Following his death, Jim Ross in an article with The Sun stated: "I won't speak at length about those that have passed away but Tony obviously had issues and was not a great guy to be around. Perhaps others have a different view of this man but I personally found him to be somewhat obnoxious and he could be a bully if allowed to be such.
"Guys like Halme don't mix well in any locker room and need to be removed from the 'team' sooner than later."
Ross added: "I still feel badly about the last years of Tony's life as things really unraveled for him seemingly due to alcohol and drug issues.
