The Guyana national football team, nicknamed the Golden Jaguars, is the national team of Guyana and is controlled by the Guyana Football Federation. It is one of three South American nations to be a member of the Caribbean Football Union of CONCACAF alongside Suriname and French Guiana. Until the independence of Guyana in 1966, it competed as British Guiana.  They qualified for the Caribbean Nations Cup in 1991, coming fourth, and in 2007. Guyana has never qualified for the CONCACAF Gold Cup or the FIFA World Cup.

History

British Guiana (1905–59)

Guyana (as British Guiana) played its first international football match on 21 July 1905, a 4-1 defeat against nearby and fellow British colony Trinidad and Tobago.  Their next recorded game came almost 16 years later on 28 January 1921, an away 2-1 win against its neighbour Surinam. The two played again in Surinam on 27 August 1923, and on that occasion the hosts won 2-1. British Guiana did not play another match until 1937, when they lost two matches against Trinidad and Tobago in Surinam: 3-0 and 3-2. After seven years without a match, British Guiana entered a three-team tournament in Trinidad & Tobago against its national side and Barbados. They won twice against Barbados (1-0 and 3-0) before drawing 1-1 and losing 3-0 to Trinidad and Tobago. In the final of this Trinagular tournament they again lost 3-0 to Trinidad and Tobago.
In November 1947 British Guiana played in a Standard Life tournament in Trinidad and Tobago. They beat the hosts 2-1 in their opening game on 5 November before beating Jamaica 2-0 the very next day. On 10 November they drew 0-0 with Jamaica before losing 2-0 to Trinidad and Tobago in the last game on 14 November.
British Guiana played its first home games in 1950 against Trinidad and Tobago: these were British Guiana's first matches since the Standard Life tournament. British Guiana lost 1-0 and 4-1 before winning 1-0. The last match played under the name British Guiana was the next match on 2 March 1959 - a 2-2 draw against Trinidad and Tobago.rsssf.html

Guyana

After independence in 1966, Guyana did not play a match for five years. Their first fixtures under their new name were qualifiers for the 1971 CONCACAF Championship against Suriname. The first match, away, was lost 4-1 and the home match on 21 September 1971 was lost 3-2 as Suriname advanced 7-3 on aggregate. In 1976 Guyana entered its first ever World Cup qualification campaign with the aim of reaching the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina. Guyana and Surinam were drawn in a two-legged preliminary in the Caribbean section of CONCACAF qualification and Guyana won the first leg 2-0 at home on 4 July 1976. The second leg in Paramaribo was lost 3-0 which allowed Surinam to advance.
Despite existing for so long the Golden Jaguars really haven't managed anything that impressive, the closest they have been to reaching the world cup it the third round qualifiers where they faced footballing giants Mexico, a 3-1 defeat followed. After this game they faced Costa Rica, a 4-0 loss lead to questions being asked of whether the jaguars could make it but head coach Jamaal Shabazz took responsibility for the defeat and inspired his team to keep pressing. Many feel Guyana has much potential in football but have been held back through lack of funding and being in the shadow of cricket. On September 7, 2012, their match against El Salvador, away, resulted in a 2-2 draw and Guyana gained 1 point, and the home match on Tuesday, September 11, resulted in a 3-2 loss against El Salvador (however, Guyana scored the first goal in this match). Then on October 12, 2012, Guyana faced Mexico in a home match at BBVA Compass Stadium in Houston, Texas, in whiched they were defeated 5-0, resulting in Guyana being eliminated by Mexico. Finally, they faced Costa Rica in an away match, defeated by Los Sele 7-0, resulting the jaguars completed disqualified from the World Cup. However hope still exists for Guyana as they have shocked many by beating Trinidad and Tobago to reach this round and many still feel they can reach the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

2006

Guyana had a remarkable calendar year 2006, with eleven successive wins, including five CONCACAF Gold Cup qualifiers  These results boosted Guyana's spot in the FIFA World Rankings by 87 spots in little over a year.  As a consequence, the team rose to the top 12 in CONCACAF and were in the third rank of seeds in the World Cup qualifying draw.

Caribbean Nations Cup 2007

At the 2006–07 Caribbean Nations Cup, Guyana finished top of Group A in Stage One, then top of Group H in Stage Two (which they hosted), and finished 3rd in the Bobby Sookram Group, missing out on a semi-final berth on goal difference alone. Had Guyana reached the semi-finals, they would have qualified for the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup.
