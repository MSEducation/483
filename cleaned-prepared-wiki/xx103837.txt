The Sikorsky MH-60T Jayhawk is a multi-mission, twin-engine, medium-range helicopter operated by the United States Coast Guard for search and rescue, law enforcement, military readiness and marine environmental protection missions. Originally designated HH-60J before being upgraded and redesignated beginning in 2007, 
Chosen to replace the HH-3F Pelican, the MH-60T is a member of the Sikorsky S-70 family of helicopters and is based on the United States Navy's SH-60 Seahawk helicopter. Development began in September 1986, first flight was achieved on 8 August 1989, and the first HH-60J entered USCG service in June 1990. Production ended in 1996 after 42 helicopters were produced; three retired SH-60F Seahawks were also remanufactured to MH-60T specifications beginning in 2010.  A total of 42 MH-60Ts are in service with the Coast Guard. U.S. Coast Guard 

Development

Chosen to replace the HH-3F Pelican, the MH-60T is a member of the Sikorsky S-70 family of helicopters and is based on the United States Navy's SH-60 Seahawk helicopter. Compared to its predecessor, the HH-3F, the HH-60J is lighter, is faster, has more powerful engines and is equipped with more sophisticated electronics. The HH-60J was developed in conjunction with the United States Navy's HH-60H Rescue Hawk. Black Hawk, The Story of a World Class Helicopter, pp. 212-213. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2007. ISBN 978-1-56347-918-2.
Sikorsky began development in September 1986 and aircraft registration number 6001 achieved first flight on 8 August 1989. The first aircraft was delivered to the USCG for developmental testing in March, 1990 at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. In March 1991, ATC Mobile, Alabama became the first USCG unit to fly the HH-60J, allowing instructor pilots to prepare for pilot training. Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, North Carolina was the first USCG operational unit to fly the HH-60J. Sikorsky produced 42 HH-60Js with sequential registration numbers from 6001 through 6042. Sikorsky ceased production in 1996 after fulfilling the 42 unit contract. Subsequently, the Coast Guard has converted three ex-Navy SH-60F Seahawks into MH-60T Jayhawks (registration numbers 6043-6045) as attrition replacements.SH-60F to MH-60T Conversion Process, United States Coast Guard, 4 April 2014

MH-60T upgrade program

The USCG began converting its 42 HH-60Js to MH-60Ts in January 2007. This avionics and capabilities upgrade is part of the USCG's Integrated Deepwater System Program and will provide a glass cockpit, an enhanced electro-optic/infrared sensor system as well as a radar sensor system and airborne use of force capability.  The MH-60T upgrades were completed in February 2014. U.S. Coast Guard, 19 February 2014.

Design

With a fuel capacity of  for six to seven hours.
The HH-60J uses the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System as its primary long range navigational aid, using a Collins RCVR-3A radio to simultaneously receive information from four of the NAVSTAR system's 18 worldwide satellites.
The HH-60J is normally based on land but can be based on 270 foot medium endurance Coast Guard Cutters (WMEC) or 378 foot high endurance Coast Guard Cutters (WHEC).
The HH-60J has a radar for search/weather that gives its nose a distinctive look. A forward looking infrared (FLIR) sensor turret can be mounted below its nose.  It can carry three  of cable.

Operational history

In 1990, HH-60J Jayhawks began replacing HH-3F Pelican and CH-3E Sea King helicopters in service with the US Coast Guard. HH-60Js perform search and rescue missions, along with other missions such as maritime patrol and drug interdiction. Black Hawk, pp. 74-74. MBI, 2003. ISBN 0-7603-1591-4.
Coast Guard cutters with their HH-60Js and other helicopters performed security and interdiction in the Persian Gulf in 1991 in support of Operation Desert Storm and also in 2003 for Operation Enduring Freedom.
On 29 October 2012, Jayhawk serial number (70-1790) 6031 was used during the offshore rescue of the crew of HMS Bounty during Hurricane Sandy.
