The Boeing 777 is a family of long-range wide-body twin-engine jet airliners developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the world's largest twinjet and has a typical seating capacity for 314 to 451 passengers, with a range of  its distinguishing features include the largest-diameter turbofan engines of any aircraft, six wheels on each main landing gear, a circular fuselage cross-section, and a blade-shaped tail cone. Developed in consultation with eight major airlines, the 777 was designed to replace older wide-body airliners and bridge the capacity difference between Boeing's 767 and 747. As Boeing's first fly-by-wire airliner, it has computer-mediated controls; it is also the first entirely computer-designed commercial aircraft.
The 777 is produced in two fuselage lengths  longer, entered service in 1998. The longer-range 777-300ER and 777-200LR variants entered service in 2004 and 2006 respectively, while a freighter version, the 777F, debuted in February 2009. Both longer-range versions and the freighter feature General Electric GE90 engines and extended raked wingtips. The earlier 777-200, -200ER and -300 versions are equipped with GE90, Pratt & Whitney PW4000 or Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. The 777-200LR is the world's longest-range airliner and can fly more than halfway around the globe; it holds the record for the longest distance flown non-stop by a commercial aircraft.
United Airlines first placed the 777 into commercial airline service on June 7, 1995. The 777 has received more orders than any other wide-body airliner; as of February 2014, 60 customers had placed orders for 1,548 aircraft of all variants, with 1,178 delivered. The most common and successful variant is the 777-300ER with 464 delivered and over 700 orders, and Emirates operates the largest 777 fleet, with 127 passenger and freighter aircraft as of June 2013. The 777 has been involved in four hull-loss accidents as of March 2014; the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 accident in July 2013 was its first fatal crash in 18 years of commercial service.
The 777 ranks as one of Boeing's best-selling models. Airlines have acquired the type as a comparatively fuel-efficient alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. Direct market competitors include the Airbus A330-300, upcoming Airbus A350 XWB, and the out-of-production A340 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11. The 787 Dreamliner, which entered service in 2011, shares design features with the 777. In November 2013, Boeing announced the development of upgraded 777-8X and 777-9X models, collectively named 777X, featuring composite wings and GE9X engines and further technologies developed for the 787.

Development

Background

In the early 1970s, the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar became the first generation of wide-body passenger airliners to enter service.
By the late 1980s, DC-10 and L-1011 models were approaching retirement age, prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs. Later plans expanded the fuselage cross-section but retained the existing 767 flight deck, nose, and other elements.
Airline customers were unimpressed with the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and an operating cost lower than any 767 stretch. Airline planners' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, adding to the heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers. By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a new design, which became the 777 twinjet. On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.

Design effort

The design phase for Boeing's new twinjet was different from the company's previous commercial jetliners. For the first time, eight major airlines – All Nippon Airways, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Delta Air Lines, Japan Airlines, Qantas, and United Airlines – had a role in the development of the airliner.
On October 14, 1990, United Airlines became the 777's launch customer when it placed an order for 34 Pratt & Whitney-powered aircraft valued at US$11 billion with options on an additional 34.
The 777 was the first commercial aircraft designed entirely on computer.

Production and testing

The production process included substantial international content, with an unprecedented level of global subcontracting for a Boeing jetliner, and higher thrust class (a measure of jet engine output) to power the world's largest twinjet.
To accommodate production of its new airliner, Boeing doubled the size of the Everett factory at the cost of nearly US$1.5 billion to provide space for two new assembly lines. New production methodologies were developed, including a turn machine that could rotate fuselage subassemblies 180 degrees, giving workers access to upper body sections. Major assembly of the first aircraft began on January 4, 1993.
On April 9, 1994, the first 777, line number WA001, was rolled out in a series of 15 ceremonies held during the day to accommodate the 100,000 invited guests. At the successful conclusion of flight testing, the 777 was awarded simultaneous airworthiness certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) on April 19, 1995.

Entry into service

Boeing delivered the first 777 to United Airlines on May 15, 1995.
On November 12, 1995, Boeing delivered the first model with General Electric GE90-77B engines to British Airways,Eden 2004, p. 115. which placed the aircraft into service five days later.
The first Rolls-Royce Trent 877-powered aircraft was delivered to Thai Airways International on March 31, 1996, completing the introduction of the three powerplants initially developed for the airliner.

Initial derivatives

After the original model, Boeing developed an increased gross weight variant of the 777-200 with greater range and payload capability., in 21 hours and 23 minutes.
Following the introduction of the -200ER, Boeing turned its attention to a stretched version of the airliner. On October 16, 1997, the 777-300 made its first flight.
From the start of the development program, Boeing had considered building ultra-long-range variants. In 1999, Boeing announced an agreement with General Electric, beating out rival proposals. As part of the deal with General Electric, Boeing agreed they would only offer GE90 engines on new 777 versions.

Longer-range models

On February 29, 2000, Boeing launched its next-generation twinjet program,
The second long-range model, the 777-200LR, rolled out on February 15, 2005, and completed its first flight on March 8, 2005. The -200LR was certified by both the FAA and EASA on February 2, 2006,
The production freighter model, the 777F, rolled out on May 23, 2008.
Initially second to the 747 as Boeing's most profitable jetliner,

Production updates

In 2010, Boeing announced plans to increase 777 production from 5 aircraft per month to 7 aircraft per month by mid-2011, and 8.3 per month by early 2013.  According to industry reports, the 777 could eventually be replaced by a new product family, the Boeing Yellowstone 3, which would draw upon technologies from the 787.
By the late 2000s, the 777 was facing the possibility of increased competition from Airbus' planned A350 XWB and internally from proposed variants of the 787, both airliners that promise fuel efficiency improvements. As a consequence, the 777-300ER received an engine and aerodynamics improvement package for reduced drag and weight. In 2010, the variant further received a  Emirates was reported as working closely with Boeing on the project, with the possibility of being the launch customer for new versions of the 777."Emirates may be launch customer for new Boeing 777". Seattle Post-Intelligencer, September 12, 2011. Retrieved September 14, 2011.
In September 2011, Boeing released more details on proposed new 777 versions, collectively referred to as 777X and tentatively designated 777-8X and 777-9X. The 777-9X is to feature extended horizontal stabilizers compared to the 777-300ER and a fuselage stretch of 
In February 2012, General Electric disclosed studies on a slightly smaller engine, dubbed the GE9X, to power the 777X. It was to feature the same fan diameter from the GE90-115B ( In August 2012, the Seattle Times reported that Boeing had slowed 777X development, but still planned for it to begin service by about 2019. "Boeing slows the pace on 777X" Seattle Times, August 22, 2012. Retrieved: August 25, 2012.

777X program

In May 2013, Boeing's board of directors gave formal permission for its Commercial Airplanes division to start offering the 777X to customers.
Boeing officially launched the 777X at the 2013 Dubai Airshow in November 2013, announcing a total of 259 orders and commitments worth more than US$95 billion.
Because deliveries of Boeing's 777X are not expected to begin until 2020, Boeing faces the challenge of maintaining an efficient production line for its existing 777 models. With 380 777s on order as of the end of 2013, and no orders booked at the most recent air show, in Singapore in February 2014,  Boeing is trying to support a production rate of 100 aircraft per year on that line.  To stimulate additional orders and bridge the gap until 777X models roll off the assembly line, Boeing vice president of sales John Wojick has proposed pairing 777X sales with sales of current generation models, and providing opportunities for passenger airlines to sell their used 777 aircraft for conversion to freighter aircraft. The airlines could then purchase new 777 passenger aircraft. "Boeing plans new tactics to sell 777". Wall Street Journal, February 13, 2014. By April 2014, with cumulative sales surpassing those of the 747, the 777 had become the best-selling wide-body airliner.

Design

Boeing introduced a number of advanced technologies with the 777 design, including fully digital fly-by-wire controls,North, David. "Finding Common Ground in Envelope Protection Systems". Aviation Week & Space Technology, August 28, 2008, pp. 66–68. fully software-configurable avionics, Honeywell LCD glass cockpit flight displays,

Fly-by-wire

In designing the 777 as its first fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models.

Airframe and systems

The wings on the 777 feature a supercritical airfoil design that is swept back at 31.6 degrees  and optimized for cruising at Mach 0.83 (revised upward after flight tests to Mach 0.84). In 2013, a new wing made of composite materials was introduced for the upgraded 777X, with a wider span and design features based on the 787's wings.
Large folding wingtips,  in length will allow 777X models to use the same airport gates and taxiways as earlier 777s. These smaller folding wingtips are less complex than those proposed for earlier 777s, and internally only affect the wiring needed for wingtip lights.
The airframe incorporates the use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8X and 777-9X).

Interior

The original 777 interior, also known as the Boeing Signature Interior, features curved panels, larger overhead bins, and indirect lighting. Seating options range from six abreast in first class up to 10 across in economy.
In 2003, Boeing introduced overhead crew rests as an option on the 777. The 747-8 and 767-400ER have also adopted the larger, more rounded windows of the original 777.
In 2011, Flight International reported that Boeing is considering replacing the Signature Interior on the 777 with a new interior similar to that on the 787, as part of a move towards a "common cabin experience" across all Boeing platforms.

Variants

Boeing uses two characteristics, fuselage length and range, to define their 777 models. Fuselage length affects the number of passengers and amount of cargo that can be carried; the 777-200 and derivatives are the base size, and the aircraft was stretched into the 777-300 in 1998. In terms of range, the aircraft has been categorized into three segments based on design criteria; these were initially defined as the following:
When referring to different variants, Boeing and airlines often collapse the model number (777) and the variant designator (-200 or -300) into a truncated form (e.g., "772" or "773" or "B77W"). These notations may be found in aircraft manuals or airline timetables.

777-200

The 777-200 was the initial A-market model. The first -200 was delivered to United Airlines on May 15, 1995. With a maximum range of 

777-200ER

The 777-200ER ("ER" for Extended Range), the B-market version of the -200, was originally known as the 777-200IGW for its increased gross weight.
The first -200ER was delivered to British Airways on February 6, 1997. Singapore Airlines, one of the type's largest customers, ordered over half of its -200ERs with reduced engine thrust specifications (de-rated) for use on medium-length routes.

777-300

The stretched 777-300 was designed as an A-market replacement for 747-100s and 747-200s. allowing the -300 to operate trunk routes previously flown by older 747s.
After being certified simultaneously by the FAA and JAA, the first -300 was delivered to Cathay Pacific on May 21, 1998. Eight different -300 customers have taken delivery of 60 aircraft, and all were in airline service as of July 2012. However, following the introduction of the longer-range -300ER in 2004, all operators have selected the ER version of the base -300 model. The -300 has no direct Airbus rival, but the A340-600 has been offered in competition.

777-200LR

The 777-200LR ("LR" for Longer Range), the C-market model, became the world's longest-range commercial airliner when it entered service in 2006. The -200LR was intended for ultra-long-haul routes such as Los Angeles to Singapore.
Developed alongside the -300ER, the -200LR features an increased MTOW and three optional auxiliary fuel tanks in the rear cargo hold.. The closest competing aircraft from Airbus was the A340-500HGW.
777-300ER=== 
The 777-300ER ("ER" for Extended Range) is the C-market version of the -300. It features raked and extended wingtips, a new main landing gear, reinforced nose gear, and extra fuel tanks. "Boeing nose ahead in Qantas order race". The Australian, December 2, 2005. Retrieved: March 20, 2009.
The first -300ER was delivered to Air France on April 29, 2004. along with a 20 percent fuel burn advantage over the 747-400. Several airlines have acquired the -300ER as a 747-400 replacement amid rising fuel prices. As of August 2013, -300ER deliveries to 24 different customers totaled 424, with 287 unfilled orders. Operators had 346 aircraft in service as of July 2012. The -300ER's direct Airbus competitors have included the A340-600HGW and the upcoming A350-1000.

777 Freighter

The 777 Freighter (777F) is an all-cargo version of the twinjet, and shares features with the -200LR; these include its airframe, engines,
As the aircraft promises improved operating economics compared to existing freighters, airlines have targeted the 777F as a replacement for older freighters including the 747-200F, MD-10, and MD-11F.  The first 777F was delivered to Air France on February 19, 2009. As of February 2013, 74 freighters had been delivered to eleven different customers, with 53 unfilled orders.  Operators had 61 of the 777F in service as of July 2012.
In the 2000s, Boeing began studying the conversion of 777-200ER and -200 passenger airliners into freighters, under the name 777 BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter).

777-8X

The 777-8X is similar in length as the 777-300ER with seating for about 350 passengers in a three-class configuration and has a range of  or more.  It is to take the place of the -200LR and be a direct competitor to the Airbus A350-1000.

777-9X

The 777-9X is a further stretched variant with seating for about 407 passengers in a three-class configuration and a range of more than .  Boeing states that it will have "no competitor in its market segment".  The 777-9X is to begin production in 2017 and enter service in 2020.

777 Tanker (KC-777)

The KC-777 was a proposed tanker version of the 777. In September 2006, Boeing announced that it would produce the KC-777, if the United States Air Force (USAF) required a larger tanker than the KC-767. The 777 tanker would have been able to transport more cargo or personnel.

Operators

The customers that have received the most 777s are ILFC, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines, and Air France. Emirates is the largest airline operator as of September 2013, and is the only customer to have operated all 777 variants produced, including the -200, -200ER, -200LR, -300, -300ER, and 777F.
A total of 1,094 aircraft (all variants) were in airline service as of July 2013, with Emirates (127), United Airlines (74), Air France (64), Singapore Airlines (56), American Airlines (55) All Nippon Airways (54), British Airways (53), Cathay Pacific (49), Japan Airlines (46) and other operators with fewer aircraft of the type."World Airliner Census".
