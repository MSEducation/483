Borealis is a Canadian power metal band from Orangeville, Ontario. Their music features soaring vocals, complex, speedy guitar riffs, as well as a supportive heavy backing rhythm.  As their website's biography puts it, "It's been that way from the start for these 5 Canadian guys: all or nothing, and it shows in their music."
When the band began in 2005, they originally employed a female opera style vocalist Siobhan O'Brian as their lead vocals frontrunner. In 2006 they recorded a demo Eyes of a Dream. Siobhan left the band between 2006-2007. Matt Marinelli became the vocalist along with continuing to play guitar in September 2007, and 2008 marked the year Borealis released their first full length album, World of Silence. In order to play this album properly live, they needed another guitarist, thus hiring Ken Fobert.
In 2011 they recorded their second album, Fall from Grace, including Ken Fobert as a true member of the band. Michael Briguglio replaced Ken between 2011-2013 and continued as a part of the band, the current guitarist.

Biography

Formation, Demo(2005-2006)

Borealis featured a female vocalist in their initial years, geared more towards a symphonic metal sound. With this lineup they recorded their first demo Eyes of a Dream. The band didn't like this setup, claiming it to be "limiting" to the style of music they wished to produce. Before September 2007 they parted ways with Siobhan O'Brian. Come September, Matt Marinelli acted as vocalist for a show where they opened for power metal legends Kamelot and Epica. The crowd's response was very positive (the band's promoter claimed it was "the best reaction to an opener he had ever heard"). As such, they asked Matt to take on the role of singer, formally completing their lineup.

World of Silence(2008-2011)

After the serious response at their opener, 2008 marked the year Borealis released their first full length album, World of Silence. They were not signed to any label at this point and the album was released on their own terms independently. It was recorded in The Recording House studio, courtesy of Sean Gregory of Emerald Rain. Gregory helped Borealis achieve the type of sound they wanted, in the end the album exceeded their expectations. In order to play this album live while staying faithful to the rhythm and lead guitar tracks, Borealis needed an additional guitarist. They looked towards a friend, Ken Fobert, to join them on their tour. After a jam session with Fobert, they confirmed his sound suited the band and hired him.

Fall from Grace(2011-2013)

After many shows, including shows where they opened for other famous acts like Edguy, they recorded a second album released internationally The album was released in Japan as well, aided by Japanese label Hydrant Music. The album was once again received in a positive way. One review attributed that the band had adopted a "mature" song writing style that typically didn't come so quickly to new bands.

Future Work (2014)

Borealis recently released a teaser video promoting a new album they plan to release in 2014.

Style and Influences

Borealis cites within interviews that when they formed they initially wished to emulate bands such as Nightwish or Sonata Arctica. They have modified their sound a bit since their debut, claiming to be influenced by bands such as Symphony X and Stratovarius when playing as openers for these famous acts. In an interview a Borealis member stated "From the usual suspects like Symphony X, Evergrey, and Avantasia, to more obscure inspirations like Hans Zimmer's movie scores and Lady Gaga's top 40 hits, we all like it and try to blend it all in our writing." Borealis's style consists of a rhythm guitar with a heavy bass end, double bass drums, baritone clean vocals similar to Russell Allen of Symphony X, and keys to expand the fullness of their sound. Occasional virtuosic guitar riffs complement the rhythm, as well as guitar solos for both guitarists, and occasional keyboard solos.
