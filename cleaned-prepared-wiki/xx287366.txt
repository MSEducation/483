Reznor's vocal lines use both minor mode and the Lydian dominant scale.

Critical reception

When referring to the song, Marc Hogan of Spin magazine had stated "The concept of "a copy of a copy" is somewhat quaint in a time when digital files can be copied limitlessly without any discernible drop in quality." Hogan had also described the drum machine in the song as "crisp" and the synths as "jittery", while noting the "overlapping vocals and smeared tendrils of fuzzy noise". 
A parody on Trent Reznor's writing style was sung to the tune of "Copy of a." Spin referred to the parody as "reductive, unfair, and more than a little silly" but also said "the way the song deploys various Reznor moves ("random percussion," "weird guitar," "creepy piano") is priceless." 

Trivia

The song was featured in the soundtrack to the video game FIFA 14.
