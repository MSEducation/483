College career

Baker began his collegiate career at the University of Delaware in 2005. Although among the team's top scout team players, Baker did not participate in a formal match-up that year.
Baker went to live with his father in Waco, Texas where he attended Collin County Community College and worked at an OfficeMax earning $9.00 an hour, which went toward his community college fees. He also worked with a professional trainer to stay in shape. Delaware retained Baker's athletic scholarship and he returned for his redshirt senior season in 2009. Baker tore multiple knee ligaments in the first quarter of the Blue Hens' first game of the year, ending his season.
Baker was denied a medical redshirt and transferred to Division II Northwest Missouri State. Baker had 66 catches for 838 yards and a touchdown, and 3 rushing touchdowns for Missouri in 2010 and was named to the Associated Press' Little All-America Team.
