[[Rishi]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu sages, Titles and occupations in Hinduism

The term Rishi (, Devanagari: ऋषि) originates from the Vedic period.  Rishis were the scribes of the large body of nature hymns and spiritual science known as the Vedas.
A Rishi (or rishika, when referring to female rishis) is a sage of insight, one who practices self-cultivation as a Yogini or Yogi and attains nirvikalpa Samadhi. Through Yogic concentration a person first attains savikalpa samadhi (realisation of the independence of soul and body, Atma and Prakriti), and with continued effort attains nirvikalpa samadhi (realisation of oneness with all). The Rishi's soul is considered to imbibe wisdom directly from the universal source.  Vedic hymns are sermons conceived as delivered by divine inspiration by the rishis.
In popular tradition, it is said that a Rishi never contradicts another Rishi because their knowledge is directly revealed by God.

Etymology

According to Indian tradition, the word was derived from the two meanings of the root rsh. Sanskrit grammarianscf. Commentary on Unādi-Sutra, iv, 119 derive this word from the second root which means "to go, to move". V. S. ApteV. S. Apte (Sanskrit-Hindi Kosh, 1890, reprint 1997 by Motilāl Banārasidās Publishers, Delhi) gives this particular meaning and derivation, and Monier-Williams also gives the same, with some qualification.
Another form of this root means (2) "to flow, to move near by flowing". (All the meanings and derivations cited above are based upon Sanskrit English Dictionary of Monier-Williams). Monier-Williams also quotes Tārānātha who compiled the great (Sanskrit-to-Sanskrit) dictionary named "ṛṣati jñānena saṃsāra-pāram" (i.e., "one who reaches beyond this mundane world by means of spiritual knowledge").
More than a century ago, Monier-Williams tentatively suggested a derivation from  "to see".ch/cgi-bin/mw. In Sanskrit, forms of the root rish become arsh- in many words, (e.g., arsh. Monier-Williams also conjectures that the root drish (to see) might have given rise to an obsolete root rish meaning "to see".
However, the root has a close Avestan cognate  meaning "rise, protrude", in the sense of "excellent".
Modern etymological explanations such as by Manfred Mayrhofer in his Etymological DictionaryEtymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen, Heidelberg 1986, I 261 leave the case open, and do not prefer a connection to ), rather one with German rasen "to be ecstatic, be in a different state of mind" (and perhaps Lithuanian aršus).

Other uses

In Carnatic Music, "Rishi" is the seventh chakra (group) of Melakarta ragas. The names of chakras are based on the numbers associated with each name. In this case, there are seven rishis and hence the 7th chakra is "Rishi". P Sambamoorthy, Published 1973, The Indian Music Publishing HouseRagas in Carnatic music by Dr. S. Bhagyalekshmy, Pub. 1990, CBH Publications
The descendent families of these Rishis, refer to their ancestral lineage through their family "gotra". This is a common practice among the Brahmin sects of the current Hindu society.

"Seer" of the Vedas

In the Vedas, the word denotes an inspired poet of Ṛgvedic hymns, who alone or with others invokes the deities with poetry. In particular, Ṛṣi refers to the authors of the hymns of the Rigveda. 
Post-Vedic tradition regards the Rishis as "sages" or saints, constituting a peculiar class of divine human beings in the early mythical system, as distinct from Asuras, Devas and mortal men. Swami Vivekananda described "Rishi"s as Mantra-drashtas or "the seers of thought". He told— "The truth came to the Rishis of India — the Mantra-drashtâs, the seers of thought — and will come to all Rishis in the future, not to talkers, not to book-swallowers, not to scholars, not to philologists, but to seers of thought."
The main rishis recorded in the Brahmanas and the Rigveda-Anukramanis include Gritsamada, Vishvamitra, Vamadeva, Atri, Bharadvaja, Vashista, Angiras, Kaṇva.
Seven Rishis (the Saptarshi) are often mentioned in the Brahmanas and later works as typical representatives of the pre-historic or mythical period; in Shatapatha Brahmana 14.5.2.6 (Brhad Aranyaka Upanisad), their names are Uddālaka Āruni (also called Gautama), Bharadvaja, Vishvamitra, Jamadagni, Vashista, Kashyapa, and Atri. Daksha, Bhrigu and Nārada were also added to the saptarshis s in Āshvalāyana-Shrauta-Sutra, where these ten principals were created by the first Manu (Svāyambhuva Manu) for producing everyone else.
The notable female rishikas who contributed to the composition of the Vedic scriptures are:
The Rig Veda mentions Romasha, Lopamudra, Apala, Kadru, Visvavara, Ghosha, Juhu, Vagambhrini, Paulomi, Yami, Indrani, Savitri, and Devayani.
The Sama Veda adds Nodha, Akrishtabhasha, Sikatanivavari and Gaupayana.
In Mahabharata 12, on the other hand, there is the post-Vedic list of Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulaha, Kratu, Pulastya and Vashista. The Mahābhārata list explicitly refers to the saptarshis of the first manvantara and not to those of the present manvantara. Each manvantara had a unique set of saptarshi. In Harivamsha 417ff, the names of the Rishis of each manvantara are enumerated.
In addition to the Sapta are added in Manusmriti iv-94 and xi-236 and in two dramas of Kālidasa.
The Chaturvarga-Chintāmani of Hemādri puts ', parivrājaka, tapasvi, muni, brahmachāri, yati, etc.
