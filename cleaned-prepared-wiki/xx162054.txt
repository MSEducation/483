On Monday, November 19, following a 14-10 home loss to the arch-rival Dallas Cowboys, Redskins head coach Jim Zorn was asked why Davis wasn't involved in the offense. Zorn answered: "It really is a matter of Davis doing his assignments correctly. It's a trust factor. It's not a speed factor. It's not an ability factor. But it makes no sense for me to put a guy out there who can run real fast, but not going in the right direction. Or in some cases not even go out. It's not that he forgot, it's just that it didn't register."
