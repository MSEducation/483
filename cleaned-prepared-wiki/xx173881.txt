Former sports

Football

Saint Joseph's College had a football team until 1939. It is unclear however of when the program officially started. One of the earlier recorded games was in 1901 against Fordham College. The outcome was a 0–0 tie. Saint Joseph's hired Edward Bennis in 1909 to coach the team. Bennis was a former football standout at the University of Pennsylvania.
SJU played many of its home games at Wynnewood Park in addition to 28th Street and Allegheny Avenue in Philadelphia. Finnesey Field, located on 54th and City Avenue, was dedicated on October 12, 1929. The opening game was played that day as Saint Joseph's lost to Pennsylvania Military College by a score of 7–6. Pennsylvania Military College would later become Widener University.
In 1925–26, Saint Joseph's started to draw up plans for a 70,000 – 80,000 seat neo-classical (colosseum) style stadium. The plans were put on permanent hold however due to both a lack of funds as well as a growing feeling among the student body that Saint Joseph's would never be able to compete with other schools in terms of football.
Though the plans for a stadium ultimately failed, the college would later name its outdoor athletic facility after James T. Finnesey who donated more than half of the original $42,000 that was initially raised to build the new stadium. Finnesey was the president of Finnesey & Kobler which was an auto manufacturer at the time.
Ironically enough, the current mascot for Saint Joseph's got its name from the football team. In 1928, a yearbook editor named Charlie Dunn started a contest in order to find a nickname for the colleges athletic teams. Suggestions from the student body were narrowed down to two nicknames; "The Hawks" and "The Grenadiers."  Ultimately, the Hawk mascot won in a narrow margin over the Grenadiers. John Gallagher ('31) was the name of the student who submitted the Hawk suggestion. 
The name was appropriate, or so the student body felt, because of the fact that they were used to seeing real hawks frequently flying over and around the campus. It was felt by Dunn that the mascot "typified the fighting spirit of our Crimson and Gray athletes..." and was "..."
Saint Joseph's college officially discontinued its football program after the 1939 season. This was done for many reasons, not the least of which was the financial burden the program placed on the college as well as "pitifully small" attendance at the games. There was growing sentiment among the student body that athletics should not be placed in front of academics and generally speaking, the football team could not compete talent wise with larger collegiate football powerhouses in the area.
From 1916–1939, the Saint Joseph's College football team played roughly 4–8 games per season. They did not field a team during the '17,'19,'20 and '21 seasons. Common opponents included P.M.C (Pennsylvania Military College) now known as Widener University, Lebanon Valley College, University of Delaware, La Salle University, Drexel University, Albright, Manhattan, West Chester University, Washington College and Villanova University. Other opponents of note include Boston College, Seton Hall, Susquehanna University, St. Johns, Temple University and Georgetown University.
During this period, the team's worst record was 0–7–1 in 1930 while the college posted a 6–2 record in 1928 as well as a 6–3 record in 1938. In its final season, the football team beat the City College of New York (20–13), Lebanon Valley College (13–2), St. Francis (13–7) and Arkansas A&M (40–17) en route to a 4–4–1 record. SJU holds an overall record of 61–75–13 during the period from 1916–1939.

Olympians

There have been 10 Hawks who have represented the United States during the Olympic games. Mike Teti competed multiple times. Seán Drea competed for Ireland.  The Hawks had two women compete as lightweight scullers on the United States Olympic Team – Teresa Zarzecki Bell (Silver Medal, 1996 Games) and Renee Hykel (10th Place, 2008 Games).
