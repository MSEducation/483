Critics

Newsweek wrote that, "Lanza brings to the role not only a fine, natural and remarkably powerful voice, but a physique and personal mannerisms reminiscent of the immortal Caruso."

Awards

The film was nominated for three Academy Awards; at the 24th Academy Awards ceremony,  Douglas Shearer and the MGM Studio Sound Department won for Best Sound.
