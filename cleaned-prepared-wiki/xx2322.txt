The Chinese remainder theorem is a result about congruences in number theory and its generalizations in abstract algebra. It was first published in the 3rd to 5th centuries by Chinese mathematician Sun Tzu.
In its basic form, the Chinese remainder theorem will determine a number n that when divided by some given divisors leaves given remainders. For example, what is the lowest number n that when divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, when divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 3, and when divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 2? 

Theorem statement

The original form of the theorem, contained in the 5th-century book Sunzi's Mathematical Classic (, Shushu Jiuzhang), is a statement about simultaneous congruences.
Suppose n1, n2, …, nk are positive integers that are pairwise coprime. Then, for any given sequence of integers a1,a2, …, ak, there exists an integer x solving the following system of simultaneous congruences.
Furthermore, all solutions x of this system are congruent modulo the product, N = n1n2…nk.
Sometimes, the simultaneous congruences can be solved even if the ni's are not pairwise coprime. A solution x exists if and only if:
All solutions x are then congruent modulo the least common multiple of the ni.
Sun Tzu's work contains neither a proof nor a full algorithm. What amounts to an algorithm for solving this problem was described by Aryabhata (6th century; see ). Special cases of the Chinese remainder theorem were also known to Brahmagupta (7th century), and appear in Fibonacci's Liber Abaci (1202).
The theorem can also be restated in the language of combinatorics as the fact that the infinite arithmetic progressions of integers form a Helly family .

Existence and uniqueness

The existence and uniqueness of the solution can easily be seen through a non-constructive argument. There are N = n1n2... Let us call this set R. And there are also N different numbers between 1 and N. For each number between 1 and N, there corresponds member of R. Can two numbers a, b, between 1 and N correspond to the same member of R? That is, can they have the same set of remainders when divided by n1, n2..., nk? If they did then a - b would be divisible by each n. Since the n's are relatively prime, a - b would be divisible by their product: N. This can't be. So this function from {1, ... N } to R is one-to-one. Since {1, ... , N} and R have the same number of elements, this function must also be onto. Thus we have established the existence of a bijection. 

Case of two equations

But we know that
We can now define the value
and it is seen to satisfy both congruences by reducing. For example

General case

and this is seen to satisfy the system of congruences by a similar calculation as before.

Finding the solution with basic algebra and modular arithmetic

For example, consider the problem of finding an integer x such that
A brute-force approach converts these congruences into sets and writes the elements out to the product of  (the solutions modulo 60 for each congruence):
To find an x that satisfies all three congruences, intersect the three sets to get:
Which can be expressed as
Another way to find a solution is with basic algebra, modular arithmetic, and stepwise substitution.
We start by translating these congruences into equations for some t, s, and u:
Start by substituting the x from equation 1 into congruence 2:
Substitute t into equation 1:
Substitute this x into congruence 3:
Casting out fives, we get
meaning that
for some integer u.
Finally,
So, we have solutions 11, 71, 131, 191, …
Notice that 60 = lcm(3,4,5). If the moduli are pairwise coprime (as they are in this example), the solutions will be congruent modulo their product.

A constructive algorithm to find the solution

Suppose, as above, that a solution is required for the system of congruences:
Because of this, and the multiplication rules allowed in congruences, one solution to the system of simultaneous congruences is:
For example, consider the problem of finding an integer x such that
Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, for x modulo 3 and 20 4×5, we find (−13) × 3 + 2 × 20 = 1; i.e., e1 = 40. For x modulo 4 and 15 3×5, we get (−11) × 4 + 3 × 15 = 1, i.e. e2 = 45. Finally, for x modulo 5 and 12 3×4, we get 5 × 5 + (−2) × 12 = 1, i.e. e3 = −24. A solution x is therefore 2 × 40 + 3 × 45 + 1 × (−24) = 191. All other solutions are congruent to 191 modulo 60, × 4 × 5 = 60, which means they are all congruent to 11 modulo 60.

Statement for principal ideal domains

For a principal ideal domain R the Chinese remainder theorem takes the following form: If u1, …, uk are elements of R which are pairwise coprime, and u denotes the product u1…uk, then the quotient ring R/uR and the product ring R/u1R× … × R/ukR are isomorphic via the isomorphism
such that
This map is well-defined and an isomorphism of rings; the inverse isomorphism can be constructed as follows. For each i, the elements ui and u/ui are coprime, and therefore there exist elements r and s in R with
This statement is a straightforward generalization of the above theorem about integer congruences: the ring Z of integers is a principal ideal domain, the surjectivity of the map f shows that every system of congruences of the form
can be solved for x, and the injectivity of the map f shows that all the solutions x are congruent modulo u.

Statement for general rings

such that
Here is a version of the theorem where R is not required to be commutative:
