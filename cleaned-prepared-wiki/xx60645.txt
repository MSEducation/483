[[GPE]]

CATEGORIES: X Window System, Embedded Linux, Graphical user interfaces, Desktop environments based on GTK+

GPE (a recursive acronym for GPE Palmtop Environment) is a graphical user interface environment for handheld computers, such as palmtops and personal digital assistants (PDAs), running some Linux kernel-based operating system. GPE is a complete environment of software components and applications which makes it possible to use a Linux handheld for tasks such as personal information management (PIM), audio playback, email, and web browsing.
GPE is free and open-source software, subject to the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

Supported devices

GPE is bundled with embedded Linux distributions targeting the following platforms:
In addition, GPE maintainers and the open source community are developing ports for additional devices:
On February 5, 2007, The GPE project announced GPE Phone Edition, a new variant of GPE developed for mobile phones.

Software components

GPE has not any of the GNOME Core Applications, but instead software was written from scratch, tailored to the embedded environment. GPE is based on GTK+, and because GTK+ did not gain support for Wayland until versions 3.10, GPE uses X11 as its windowing system, e.g. with the combination X.
The project provides an infrastructure for easy and powerful application development by providing core software such as shared libraries, database schemata, and building on available technology including SQLite, D-BUS, GStreamer and several of the more common standards defined by freedesktop.
One of the major goals of the GPE project is to encourage people to work on free software for mobile devices and to experiment with writing a GUI for embedded devices. Some of the applications already developed for GPE include:
GPE's PIM applications (GPE-Contacts, GPE-Calendar, GPE-ToDo) can be synchronized with their desktop and web counterparts (such as Novell Evolution, Mozilla Sunbird and Google Calendar) through the use of GPE-Syncd and the OpenSync framework.
GPE also contains a number of GUI utilities for configuring 802.11 Wireless LAN, Bluetooth, IrDA, Firewall, ALSA, Package Management, among others.
A mobile push e-mail client based on the Tinymail framework is in development.

Linux distributions

GPE can be found as a primary environment in the following embedded Linux distributions:
Though it may not be as highly supported as the distributions listed above, GPE is also available through package management utilities in the following distributions:

Controversy

There are ongoing controversies surrounding the GPE project regarding a change of hosting service, ownership of an IRC channel, and a trademark dispute.

Web hosting

Serious issues first began developing over a proposed change of hosting service. GPE had been hosted at Handhelds. Some of GPE's developers suggested, and later followed through with, a move to Linuxtogo.

IRC channel

Both parties claim ownership of the #gpe IRC channel located on freenode. Freenode has placed the channel in trust, or locked, until both sides can come to an agreement. Subsequently, Linuxtogo.org uses #handhelds-gpe, both on Freenode.

Trademark

George France, has filed for trademark registration with the USPTO for GPE, in addition to OPIE and Ipkg as of March 6, 2007.
Handhelds.org for public development.
The GPE developers working at Linuxtogo.org was only a hosting provider.
The USPTO issued a final rejection regarding the GPE trademark on February 27, 2008. George France amended the application (removing references to GNU and Linux). The GPE trademark was officially published for opposition June 3, 2008.
Despite George France's impending personal GPE trademark, the core GPE development team at Linuxtogo.org GPE infrastructure. Linuxtogo.
The Trademark of GPE was registered to George France on Aug 19, 2008 by the USPTO
