Gypsy is a musical with music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and a book by Arthur Laurents.  Gypsy is loosely based on the 1957 memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee, the famous striptease artist, and focuses on her mother, Rose, whose name has become synonymous with "the ultimate show business mother."  It follows the dreams and efforts of Rose to raise two daughters to perform onstage and casts an affectionate eye on the hardships of show business life. The character of Louise is based on Lee, and the character of June is based on Lee's sister, the actress June Havoc.  
The musical contains many songs that became popular standards, including "Everything's Coming up Roses", "Together (Wherever We Go)",  "Small World", "Some People", "Let Me Entertain You", "All I Need Is the Girl", and "Rose's Turn". It is frequently considered one of the crowning achievements of the mid-20th century's conventional musical theatre art form, often called the "book musical".
Gypsy has been referred to as the greatest American musical by numerous critics and writers, among them Ben Brantley ("what may be the greatest of all American musicals...")Brantley, Ben. "New Momma Takes Charge". The New York Times. May 2, 2003. and Frank Rich. The Hot Seat: Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980-1993. Random House. 1998. ISBN 0-679-45300-8. Rich wrote that " Gypsy is nothing if not Broadway's own brassy, unlikely answer to 'King Lear.'"Rich, Frank. "Review/Theater; 'Gypsy' Is Back on Broadway With a Vengeance", 'The New York Times, November 17, 1989 Theater critic Clive Barnes wrote that " 'Gypsy' is one of the best of musicals..." and described the character of Rose as "one of the few truly complex characters in the American musical...."Barnes, Clive. " 'Gypsy' Bounces Back With Zest and Lilt". The New York Times''. September 24, 1974

Background

A musical based on the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee was a project of producer David Merrick and actress Ethel Merman. Merrick had read a chapter of Lee's memoirs in Harper's Magazine and approached Lee to obtain the rights. Jerome Robbins was interested, and wanted Leland Hayward as co-producer; Merman also wanted Hayward to produce her next show. "Culled From a Stripper's Past". The New York Times. May 17, 1959. p. X1  Merrick and Hayward approached Arthur Laurents to write the book. As he relates, Laurents initially was not interested until he saw that the story was one of parents living their children's lives. Composers Irving Berlin and Cole Porter declined the project. Finally, Robbins asked Stephen Sondheim, who agreed to do it. Sondheim had worked with Robbins and Laurents on the musical West Side Story. However, Merman did not want an unknown composer, and wanted Jule Styne to write the music. Although Sondheim initially refused to write only the lyrics, he was persuaded by Oscar Hammerstein to accept the job. Sondheim & Co., Second Edition (1986), pp37-39, pp50-51, ISBN 0-06-015649-X

Synopsis

Act I

Rose and her two daughters, Baby June and Louise, play the vaudeville circuit around the United States in the early 1920s. Rose, the archetype of a stage mother, is aggressive and domineering, pushing her children to perform. While June is an extroverted, talented child star, the older girl, Louise, is shy. The kiddie act has one song, "Let Me Entertain You", that they sing over and over again, with June always as the center-piece and Louise often as one of the "boys" ("Baby June and Her Newsboys"). Rose has big dreams for the girls but encounters setbacks, as she tells her father ("Some People"). When Rose meets a former agent, Herbie, she persuades him to become their manager using her seductive and feminine wiles ("Small World"). The girls grow up, and June, now billed as Dainty June, and her act have a chance to perform for Mr. Goldstone ("Mr. Goldstone, I Love You"). Meanwhile, Louise celebrates her birthday alone and asks her birthday present, a lamb, just how old she is this year ("Little Lamb"). After Rose rejects Herbie's marriage proposal, he considers leaving, but she asserts that he could never get away from her ("You'll Never Get Away From Me"). Now billed as "Dainty June and Her Farmboys", the act finally performs on the Orpheum Circuit ("Dainty June and Her Farmboys"). June is soon offered a place at a Performing Arts school after an audition. However, Rose turns this down, refusing to break up the act. Louise and June fantasize what life would be like if Rose were married and finished with show business ("If Mama was Married"). A few months later, still on the road from show to show, Tulsa, one of the boys from the act, confides in Louise that he has been working on his own act ("All I Need Is The Girl"), and Louise fantasizes that she and he could do the act together. Shortly after, June is missing, and in a note she explains that she has grown sick of her mother and the endless tour and has eloped with Tulsa, and they will do a new act. Rose is hurt, but then optimistically vows that she will make Louise a star, proclaiming that "Everything's Coming up Roses".

Act II

Louise is now a young woman, and Rose has built a pale imitation of the Dainty June act for her. Using all girls, Rose and Herbie try valiantly to sell "Madame Rose's Toreadorables" to a fading vaudeville industry. However, they are still together ("Together, Wherever We Go"). With no vaudeville venues left, Louise and her second-rate act wind up accidentally booked at a burlesque house in Wichita, Kansas, as a means to deter police raids. Rose is anguished, as she sees what a booking in burlesque means to her dreams of success, but Louise persuades her that two weeks' pay for the new act is better than unemployment. As they are introduced to Louise, three of the strippers on the bill advise her on what it takes to be a successful stripper, a "gimmick," something that "makes your strip special" ("You Gotta Get a Gimmick"). Backstage, Rose proposes marriage to Herbie. He asks her to break up the act and let Louise have a normal life, and she reluctantly accepts, agreeing to marry the day after their show closes. On the last day of the booking, the star stripper in the burlesque show is arrested for solicitation. Desperate, Rose cannot resist the urge to give Louise another nudge toward stardom, and she volunteers Louise to do the strip tease as a last-minute replacement. Disgusted at Rose's blind ambition for her daughter, Herbie walks out on Rose forever ("Small World" Reprise). Although reluctant, Louise wants to please her mother and she goes on, assured by Rose that she needn't actually strip, but simply walk elegantly and tease by dropping a single shoulder strap. Shy and hesitant, she sings a titillating version of the old kiddie act song, "Let Me Entertain You". She removes only her glove, but she speaks directly to her 'audience', which becomes her "gimmick" ("Let Me Entertain You (Gypsy Strip Tease)").
In the months that follow Louise becomes secure, always following her mother's advice to "Make 'em beg for more, and then don't give it to them!" The song becomes brasher and brassier, and more and more articles of clothing come off. Ultimately, Louise becomes a major burlesque star and does not need her mother any longer. After a bitter argument between Rose and Louise, who has become the sophisticated "Gypsy Rose Lee," Rose realizes Herbie and June are both gone, and now Louise is lost to her as well. Rose, feeling sad, useless and bitter, asks "Why did I do it? What did it get me?" ("Rose's Turn"). All of Rose's unrequited dreams of her own stardom and her personal demons surface. She fantasizes about her own lit-up runway and cheering audience, but finally admits "I did it for me."  After her admission to Louise, Mother and daughter tentatively step toward reconciliation in the end.

Songs

Notes on the songs
† Titled "Mr. Goldstone" in the 2003 revival, and "Have an Eggroll, Mr. Goldstone" in the 2008 revival 
†† Titled "The Strip" in the 2008 revival"Gypsy: A musical fable, St. James Theatre (3/27/2008 - 1/11/2009)". Internet Broadway Database. and on the recording of the 1989 revival. iTunes. 
 In the 1973 London and 1974 Broadway productions, this number featured an extended dance sequence in the middle of the song, which was not featured in the original score.
During the pre-Broadway tryout tour, several songs were cut, including a song for Herbie called "Nice She Ain't" (cut because it was given to Jack Klugman one week prior to opening and he could not memorize the keys and staging in time), and a song for Baby June and Baby Louise titled "Mama's Talkin' Soft". The latter song was cut partly because the staging required the little girls to stand on a platform elevated above the stage, which terrified the young actress playing Baby Louise and partly because the show was running too long. "Mama's Talkin' Soft" was later recorded by Petula Clark and released as a single in the UK in 1959."Petula Clark discography".

Dramatic analysis

In analyzing the character of Rose, Clive Barnes described her as "bossy, demanding, horrific...."  Rich described Rose as "a monster". Critic Walter Kerr commented that though Rose is a monster, she must be liked and understood. "Two Musicals We Need Have Checked In". The New York Times. December 17, 1989. p. H7 Patti LuPone describes Rose: "She has tunnel vision, she's driven, and she loves her kids.... And she is a survivor.  I do not see her as a monster at all—she may do monstrous things, but that does not make a monster."Lunden, Jeff. "Stage Mother from Hell: Needy, Greedy Mama Rose". NPR. April 13, 2008. Sondheim has said of the character: "The fact that she's monstrous to her daughters and the world is secondary... She's a very American character, a gallant figure and a life force."Rich, Frank. "Theatre – 'Gypsy': Then, Now and Always". The New York Times. May 4, 2003. p.  Louise comes out a star and forgives her mother.  There is hope for her.  Rose does confront who she is in 'Rose's Turn.'  There is a catharsis. It's not Rodgers and Hammerstein, but you feel maybe the mother and daughter will come to an understanding and maybe triumph over Rose's craziness and Louise's bitterness."
Brantley noted that Rose is a "mythic character". She is "Traditionally presented as an armored tank on autopilot, which finally crashes only minutes before the final curtain...."
Bernadette Peters' take of the character was different: "Rose was a woman who was traumatized by her own mother leaving her at an early age. I think that longing for acceptance is what fuels all her ambition. In the end, when she confronts herself in 'Rose's Turn', she realizes she has failed her daughter just as her own mother failed her... There is a vulnerability to Rose that makes her human, not just some loud and cartoonish parody of a stage mother."

Productions

Original production

The original Broadway production opened on May 21, 1959 at The Broadway Theatre, transferred to the Imperial Theatre, and closed on March 25, 1961 after 702 performances and two previews.  The show was produced by David Merrick and directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins. Ethel Merman starred as Rose, with Jack Klugman as Herbie and Sandra Church as Louise. Scenic and Lighting design were by Jo Mielziner and costumes were by Raoul Pène Du Bois. The orchestrations, including an overture,Kantor, Michael and Laurence Maslon, Broadway: The American Musical, Bulfinch Press, New York, p. 286. were supplied by Sid Ramin and Robert Ginzler.
Critic Frank Rich has referred to Robbins' work as one of the most influential stagings of a musical in American theatrical history.  The original production received eight Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical, Best Actress in a Musical, Best Featured Actor in a Musical, Best Featured Actress in a Musical, Best Scenic Design, Best Costume Design and Best Direction of a Musical, but failed to win any.
When the show closed in March 1961, two national touring companies toured the US.

The second national company starred Mitzi Green as Rose, followed by Mary McCarty, and a young Bernadette Peters in various ensemble roles. It opened in September 1961 at the Shubert Theatre, Detroit and closed in January 1962 at the Hanna, Cleveland, Ohio.

1973 London production

In 1973, it was announced that Elaine Stritch would be starring in the first West End production of the show. However, when ticket sales proved to be unsuccessful, producers hired the more familiar Angela Lansbury (according to Craig Zadan, "The ....."). Sondheim & Co. (1974, 1986 2nd Ed.), Harper & Row, ISBN 0-06-015649-X, p. 54 The West End production opened at the Piccadilly Theatre on May 29, 1973. It was produced by Barry M. Brown and Fritz Holt, in association with Edgar Lansbury (Angela's brother) and directed by the show's author, Arthur Laurents with choreography reproduced by Robert Tucker. The supporting cast featured Zan Charisse, Barry Ingham, Debbie Bowen and Bonnie Langford. Lansbury left the London production in December 1973 to tour the show in the USA and was succeeded by Dolores Gray. The production closed on March 2, 1974, after 300 performances.

1974 Broadway revival

Prior to opening on Broadway, the Lansbury West End production had a 24 week tour of North America, starting in Toronto, and then travelling to many cities, including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, DC and Boston.

This production won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival and Daly won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance.
Jule Styne, in a 1989 interview in connection with the California tryout, said: "About six months ago, Bette Midler wanted to buy it ('Gypsy') for a movie.  We wouldn't sell it.  Because they'd only destroy it." USA Today reported that "Both Liza Minnelli and Bernadette Peters say they would love to play it, but they weren't even approached for this production."

2003 Broadway revival

A new Broadway revival began previews on March 31, 2003 and opened on May 1, 2003 at the Shubert Theatre. The director was Sam Mendes, with choreography by Jerry Mitchell and costumes and sets by Anthony Ward.  Bernadette Peters played the role of Rose. The New York Times described Peters as "a surefire box office draw who nonetheless may surprise some Gypsy aficionados... Peters fit into the role of Rose, a part indelibly marked by its brassy, belting originator, Ethel Merman?...'One of the main reasons I wanted to do the piece was to cast someone as Rose that was closer to Rose as she really existed,' Mr. Mendes said. 'She was a tiny woman. And she was a charmer. And so is Bernadette.'"McKinley, Jesse. "On Stage and Off". The New York Times. February 8, 2002. Laurents had talked to Mendes ("Roughly five years ago" according to the New York Times in 2003) about directing the revival, and Mendes said "he was surprised by the idea of casting Ms. Peters as Rose". "New 'Gypsy' Struts, Silencing Naysayers". The New York Times. May 5, 2003. Section E, p.1 Laurents notes of his suggestions on this production are in his 2009 book Mainly on Directing 'Gypsy', 'West Side Story' and Other Musicals. In a 2004 interview Laurents said that Peters' portrayal of Rose was "brilliant, original, totally unlike any of the others" while criticizing Mendes for the "physical production" which Laurents said "was misconceived and hurt the show more than people realized."Bryer, Jackson R.; Davison, Richard Allan. The art of the American musical: conversations with the creators (2005) Rutgers - the State University (NYC), ISBN 978-0-8135-3612-5, p.138 Gypsy had begun previews with a virtually bare stage, but by opening night this had been changed to a minimalist set. "No 'Gypsy' In Her Soul". New York Daily News. May 2, 2003. The cast featured John Dossett as Herbie, Tammy Blanchard as Louise, Kate Reinders as June and David Burtka as Tulsa. The production was nominated for four Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical and Best Actress in a Musical.
In his review, Ben Brantley in The New York Times wrote that "the surprise coup of many a Broadway season... Peters has created the most complex and compelling portrait of her long career..... Peters, however, can be said to have broken the Merman mold completely."Brantley, Ben. "New Momma Takes Charge". The New York Times. May 2, 2003.
Gypsy twice set new box office records for the Shubert Theatre. Its gross of $853,476 for the week of June 9–14, 2003 was the highest ever gross for a non-holiday week and the subsequent June 15–21, 2003 box office gross of $874,397 represented the highest gross for a show in Shubert history. "Momma's Goin' Strong: Gypsy Breaks All-Time Shubert Box-Office Record". Playbill. June 23, 2003. However, the New York Times announced that Gypsy would close on February 28, 2004, stating:" Gypsy sold well for most of 2003. But by early January 2004, with tourists gone and local theatergoers staying inside during a brutal stretch of weather, the production's sales grew increasingly weak. More important, the show's advance sale, the main indicator of a production's staying power, began to shrink rapidly. It stood at less than $2 million yesterday."McKinley, Jesse. "'Gypsy' to Close Feb. 28, At a Loss of Millions". The New York Times. February 3, 2004. After an increase in the gross, the show's closing was postponed indefinitely, but Gypsy finally closed on May 30, 2004 after 451 performances and 33 previews."Final Curtain to Fall on 'Gypsy' May 30". The New York Times. April 22, 2004. The production is believed to have recouped a little more than half of its $8 million investment.

2008 Broadway revival

Patti Lupone first portrayed Rose in Gypsy at the Chicago Ravinia Festival in August 2006, directed by Lonny Price and accompanied by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Patti's Turn: LuPone Is Mama Rose in Ravinia's Gypsy Beginning Aug. 11". Playbill. August 11, 2006. It began as a concert production but evolved into a full-fledged production featuring Jerome Robbins' original choreography recreated by Bonnie Walker and even a live lamb.nytimes.html. LuPone in 'Gypsy': "Light the Lights, Boys! Mama Rose Hears a Symphony." By Charles Isherwood. New York Times Theatre Review.  August 15, 2006. Excitement was generated around LuPone playing the role of Rose that producers were eager to see Price's production, with the hope of moving it to New York. Jack Viertel, the artistic director of New York City Center Encores! saw the production and was so impressed that he contacted Arthur Laurents, requesting him to direct a new fully staged production of the show for a new program, as part of the Encores! series. 'Gypsy' Mainly on Directing, Random House Digital, Inc., 2009, ISBN 0-307-27088-2, p. 45  From July 9 to 29, 2007, the show was presented at City Center with LuPone once again. Directed by Arthur Laurents, the production also featured Laura Benanti as Louise, Boyd Gaines as Herbie and Leigh Ann Larkin as June.  Lenora Nemetz, Marilyn Caskey, and Alison Fraser played the strippers Mazeppa, Electra, and Tessie Tura.
LuPone recounted in her memoirs that, when Laurents began directing this production, he based his direction initially on the 1989 revival, "because, I think that in Arthur's mind, the Tyne Daly 'Gypsy' had been the last successful production." However, the cast "questioned Arthur relentlessly about...LuPone, Patti. "'Gypsy'" Patti LuPone: A Memoir, Random House, Inc., 2010, ISBN 0-307-46073-8, p. 288
The Encores! production was a success, and despite Ben Brantley's somewhat negative review of LuPone's performance in the New York Times, the show transferred to Broadway, where it opened at the St. James Theatre on March 27, 2008. Brantley gave the production a rave review, praising LuPone, Laurents and the rest of the cast, and describing the characterizations in the production:
 "You see, everyone's starved for attention in 'Gypsy.'  That craving, after all, is the motor that keeps showbiz puttering along.  And Mr. Laurents makes sure that we sense that hunger in everyone....  I was so caught up in the emotional wrestling matches between the characters (and within themselves), that I didn't really think about the songs as songs....  There is no separation at all between song and character, which is what happens in those uncommon moments when musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons to be."Brantley, Ben. "Curtain Up! It's Patti's Turn". New York Times. March 28, 2008. 
This production won numerous awards including the Tony Awards and Drama Desk Awards for LuPone, Gaines and Benanti. The show was originally scheduled to close in March 2009 on Lupone's final performance, but closed on January 11, 2009 due to decreases in ticket sales. "LuPone Gypsy Will Now Close in January 2009". Playbill. December 14, 2008. Like the 2003 production, this revival also closed at a loss. When it closed it played 332 performances and 27 previews. On the eve before the final curtain call, LuPone made news when she literally stopped the show in the middle of the song "Rose's Turn", to scold a patron for taking illegal photographs during the performance.STAGE TUBE: Brian Williams Takes on Audience Cell Phone Usage - Patti LuPone & MoreCell Free?

Patti LuPone had performed in Gypsy prior to Broadway. She has stated that when she was thirteen years old, she starred as Louise in a high-school production of the show. Lupone had voiced interest in heading the 2003 Broadway revival but author Arthur Laurents had reportedly banned her from any future work with his involvement, as she had previously walked out on a production of Jolson Sings Again, written by Laurents, in 1995.

Film and TV versions

Rosalind Russell, Karl Malden, and Natalie Wood starred in the 1962 Warner Bros. film adaptation of the musical. Russell won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her portrayal of Rose.
Gypsy was also adapted as 1993 television movie with Bette Midler playing Rose. Cynthia Gibb portrayed Louise and Jennifer Beck portrayed Dainty June. Bette Midler won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV; Michael Rafter won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music Direction. This production was a rare example of a film or TV project in which some of the songs are sung live, and not Lip synced to a prerecorded track. "Cast shines in latest version of musical hit 'Gypsy'". The Houston Chronicle. December 12, 1993. Section: Television, p. 3. "It's surely the first time in a long time that the actors singing the songs are actually singing them, instead of just moving their lips to a pre-recording."
In January 2011 the New York Post reported that Barbra Streisand is in negotiations to produce, direct and star in a new film version of Gypsy. In an interview with the New York Post, Arthur Laurents said: "We've talked about it a lot, and she knows what she's doing. She has my approval." He said that he would not write the screenplay.

However, Frank Rizzo of courant.""Streisand/'Gypsy' Film Project a No-Go, Says Arthur Laurents". Hartford Courant (courant. March 12, 2011. But now that is contradicted by an August 2011 report by USATODAY that the plans for a film adaptation of Gypsy are still intact. "Before writer and director Arthur Laurents died at age 93 last May, there had been much talk about a movie version of 'Gypsy' starring Streisand as Rose. 'We just have to find our team and a writer,' said Streisand. 'It's too bad, because I was looking forward to working with Arthur,' who directed Streisand in her Broadway debut. 'I had seen him a few months before that, and he seemed so strong and healthy.'""Barbra Streisand Says GYPSY Film Still On" broadwayworld.com, August 18, 2011

Recordings

There are recordings of each of the Broadway  and London productions, as well as the film and television productions. The original 1959 and revival 2003 cast albums each won the Grammy Award, Best Original Cast Show Album.
The original Broadway cast album was Ethel Merman's first recording in the then-new stereophonic sound technology. Motion pictures recorded in stereo had been steadily made since 1953, and stereo was first used on magnetic tape in 1954, but it was not until 1958, a year before Gypsy opened, that it became possible to use this technology on records.
The 1974 Broadway recording was not an actual recording of the Broadway revival, but a remix of the London Cast recording of 1973 with a new recording of "Some People".
The 2008 Broadway cast  recording was released August 28, 2008.
