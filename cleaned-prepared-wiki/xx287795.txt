History

On March 26, 1872, Kimberly, Clark & Co. was established in Neenah, Wisconsin through the partnership of four businessmenâ€”John A. Kimberly, Havilah Babcock, Charles B. Clark and Frank C. Shattuck.
The first recorded healthcare product by Kimberly-Clark was absorbent wadding, intended to replace cotton. It was used as a bandage for wounded soldiers in World War I. Army nurses adapted the material for menstrual use.
In 1980, Health Care began to grow as it was separated from consumer packaged goods management and products, such as Kleenex, with a move to Roswell, Georgia, its current headquarters.

Expansion

Kimberly-Clark Health Care opened European Health Care operations in Brussels in 1991.
In 1999, Kimberly-Clark Health Care expanded into new global markets with the introduction of medical devices, including Mic-Key Enteral Feeding Systems and Trach Care Closed Suction Systems.

Company acquisitions

In 1998, Ballard Medical Product, a maker of disposable medical devices for respiratory care, gastroenterology and cardiology, was purchased by Kimberly-Clark for $764 million.
That same year, Kimberly-Clark also acquired TECNOL Medical Products, Inc., a maker of disposable face masks and patient care products.
Kimberly-Clark acquired Safeskin Corporation in 2000, a maker of disposable gloves for healthcare, high technology and scientific industries.
In 2009, Kimberly-Clark acquired Baylis Medial Company's Pain Management Business.
Also in 2009, Kimberly-Clark acquired I-Flow Corporation, a healthcare company that develops and markets drug delivery systems and products for post-surgical pain relief and surgical site care.

Products

Kimberly-Clark Health Care focuses on five categories of products.

Surgical solutions

K-C's surgical solutions focus on protecting the healthcare professional during procedures and keeping the surgical environment sterile.
Products include:
Kimberly-Clark Health Care developed the MicroCool Breathable High Performance Surgical Gown. It has the highest AAMI level of liquid barrier protection against blood and other bodily fluids. The gown has a micro porous fabric, which utilizes two layers of nonwoven fabric to enclose a protective film layer that "breathes," to dispel body heat.
In 1978, Kimberly-Clark invented Kimguard Sterilization Wrap as an affordable, high-performance alternative to traditional cloth wrapping materials and metal containers. Since creating the original wrap, Kimberly-Clark made two improvements to the product, resulting in One-Step and One-Step Quick Check sterilization wraps.

Digestive health

Kimberly Clark offers digestive health products for enteral feeding, diagnostics and endoscopy procedures.
Products include:
Kimberly-Clark's Mic-Key Low-Profile & Mic Feeding Tubes are used in patients who require enteral feeding, can't tolerate oral feeding, require gastric decompression and/or medication delivery directly into either the stomach, distal to the stomach, distal duodenum or proximal jejunum.

Respiratory health

HAI watch programs

Not on My Watch

In 2008, Kimberly-Clark Health Care launched a global educational campaign, Not on My Watch. Its purpose is to educate healthcare workers and support their efforts to reduce the spread of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) such as MRSA, CLABSI and Cdiff.
Kimberly-Clark Health Care offers a patient-focused website for HAI prevention, preventinfections. It is an educational website for both patients and caregivers that includes information on how they can protect themselves from the risk of HAIs during a stay in the hospital or other healthcare facility.

HAI Watchdog

In 2010, the HAI Watchdog Awards were created to recognize the efforts of healthcare professionals working together to prevent healthcare-associated infections (HAI). It facilitates the sharing of best practices among clinicians and recognizes four exceptional participants with educational grants. The awards are broken into two categories:

=Clinician's Choice Award=

This category is for HAI prevention initiatives that help educate and build awareness, but may not be directly measured by specific HAI rate changes.

=Panel-Judged Award=

This category is for successful programs yielding a measurable reduction in HAI rates over time.

Clean Hands Care

In 2013, Kimberly-Clark released a campaign called "Clean Hands Care" to spread awareness about how washing and sanitizing hands can prevent Hospital-Associated Infections (HAI).
