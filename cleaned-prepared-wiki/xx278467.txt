Crest Capital provides financing to businesses for purchase or lease of new or used equipment.
Through its president, Mark French's contributions to section179. Section 179 of the IRS tax code allows small, medium-sized and large businesses to write off business expenses related to the acquisition of new or used equipment in a particular tax year. Crest Capital assists businesses to benefit from this IRS tax incentive to write-off acquisitions of equipment and software. As of 2011, businesses were able to claim up to $500,000. Businesses exceeding this limit are also able to benefit from further reductions for equipment acquired that is valued above $2 million. This deduction also applies to the acquisition of software, computers and other equipment used in the business.
The innovation of payment and tax calculators by Crest Capital has impacted the equipment financing industry. Crest Capital's payment and tax calculators are deployed through strategic partners and others involved in the distribution and funding of business fixed assets and related tax ramifications. Manufacturers and distributors of equipment, vehicles and software have deployed the payment tax calculators on commercial websites. Other organizations utilize the calculators to promote economic development via small business capital spending.
Through Crest Capital Equipment Finance, Crest Capital partners with equipment dealers to make purchase and lease financing opportunities available to their customers.
