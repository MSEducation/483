Mixed martial arts career

A former amateur wrestler, Asahi was trained in Satoru Sayama's Super Tiger Gym, where he learned shoot wrestling. He made his debut in Shooto in 1992 submitting Tomoyuki Saito. Showing his grappling excellence, Noboru captured the Shooto Featherweight Championship from Kazuhiro Sakamoto and enjoyed a thirteen-fights winning streak, with victories over Yuki Nakai and Masato Suzuki. His streak snapped, however, when he lost to Brazilian jiu-jitsu specialist Royler Gracie in the Vale Tudo Japan, struggling with the Brazilian grappler until he got caught in a choke. After that, he lost his title to Alexandre Franca Nogueira by technical submission. He did better in the next VTJ, fighting to a draw with another BJJ expert, João Roque.
