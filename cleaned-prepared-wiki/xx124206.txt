OLF forces retreat into Kenya, February 3, 2006]]
The OLF states that the protracted armed resistance under the leadership of the Front is an act of self-defense exercised by the Front against successive Ethiopian governments, including the current one, which OLF believes is forcibly denying the Oromo people their right to self-determination. So the OLF armed resistance hopes to target the government's coercive machinery, not innocent civilians. The OLF has an anti terrorism stand and opposes terrorism as means of struggle to achieve the right of the Oromo people. The Organization considers terrorism as act of desperation. So it has a clear and peaceful policy on its actions against civilians in Ethiopia. Therefore, anti-terrorism against civilians remains a core policy of the organization even though OLF has not made a clear distinction between its armed struggle and terrorism acts against current and future Ethiopian governments.OLF's past military activities in Ethiopia
On Religion and Religious Extremism
The Oromo people are followers of three major religions: Islam, Christianity and traditional Oromo religion. The OLF claims to respect religious equality and pursues secular policy. It opposes religious domination and religious extremism of any kind. It believes the composition of its members and supporters among the Oromo people, irrespective of religious divides, is a clear testimony to the organization's correct democratic policy on religion.
On Right of Minorities in Oromia
In Oromia there are minorities who have distinct identity and culture of their own. Some minorities in Oromia are economically, culturally, and politically closely linked with the Oromo people. The OLF recognizes and respects the right of minorities in accordance with internationally accepted principles to develop their culture, administer their own affairs, enjoy equal rights in every field of activity. Just like the current Ethiopian government, the OLF has also undertaken to vigorously work for the full realization of these rights and will take necessary measures to strengthen the bond of fraternity between the Oromo people and minorities in Oromia.
Solidarity with "Oppressed Peoples"
The OLF believes that solidarity and cooperation among the oppressed peoples led by their respective forces is essential for realization of their common objectives of liberation. The organization has been working towards unity of struggle among the oppressed peoples to counter the enemy schemes and reduce the cost of achieving their political objectives of liberation. The OLF believes the alignment of the Ethiopian government with forces resisting genuine change in Ethiopia is posing a real threat to the oppressed and subjugated peoples in the country. The organization declares that there are indications that militaristic and chauvinistic elements who are aspiring to restore the old order are demanding for the reversal of what minimum change Oromo people have achieved through their struggle. It states that the Ethio-Eritrean conflict is going to directly affect the oppressed nations and nationalities economically and in terms of human casualty, and continuation of suppression and violation of human rights by creating pretexts connected with the war situation. The OLF is prepared to revitalize and strengthen previous agreements concluded with some organizations of oppressed peoples and work towards a formation of a platform to co-ordinate and channel their human and material resources to meet the challenge of the day.

Criticism of the OLF

Colonial Claims

The OLF established its organization based on a core ideology that the ethnic Oromo people were colonized by non-Oromos and they need to be liberated from that colonization. However, these OLF claims are disputed by other Ethiopians and even some Oromos, including by a group of high level former members of the OLF leadership who eventually split from the OLF.
There has also been criticism of the terminology the OLF uses; since its formation, the OLF has used the terminology "Abyssinian colonialism" to describe the alleged colonization of ethnic Oromos by non-Oromos (abyssinians) during the 1880s conquests by Emperor Menelik. However, both Oromos and non-Oromo Ethiopians alike have disagreed on such strict use of the word "Abyssinians" as exclusively meaning non-Oromo Ethiopians, because Oromo conquestsp.24. Paul Trevor William Baxter, Jan Hultin, Alessandro Triulzi. 1996. Being and Becoming Oromo: Historical and Anthropological Enquiries. Nordic Africa Institute. since the 1500s have led to northern Oromos being part and parcel of the Abyssinian empires centered in Gondar.283-4.  One particular example used by Ethiopianist Oromos, like Dr. Merera Gudina, against OLF is the historical accounts on Oromo rule of Ethiopia in the 1700s, including the Yejju Oromos "controlling the imperial seat at Gonder for about eighty years."  Ethiopianists claim that since Oromos were citizens of Abyssinia for several centuries (both as peasants and in its leadership), Abyssinia itself is made up of its Oromo citizens.280-290. Thus northern Oromos were Abyssinians, long before Emperor Menelik was born to lead the alleged "Abyssinian conquest of Oromos." History 101: Fiction and Facts on Oromos of Ethiopia Therefore, since an ethnic group can not colonize itself, both the incorrect use of the word "Abyssinia" and the claim of "colonization of Oromo" terminology has been disputed by Ethiopianists.Record set straight on Ethiopia's Oromo people

Development

Another argument given by critics of OLF is its impact on the development of Ethiopia. Most critics of OLF imply that various development projects in southern Ethiopia have been suppressed due to the war waged by the OLA in those regions. In fact. various Oromo elders, Gaada leaders, Oromo religious head persons and Oromo political leaders living in Ethiopia have collectively denounced the destabilizing role of OLF in Oromia state including.oromiagov.asp Groups allied to the OLF, such as the ONLF, have also been accused of stopping development plans in the Ogaden Region of Ethiopia including violence against formation of educational facilitiesExplosions in Educational institutions caused by OLF and the work of oil firms like the Chinese ZPEB and Malaysian oil firm Petronas.OLF claims of attacks
One of the most outspoken Oromo leaders against the OLF organization has been Dr. In 2002, after OLF rebels attacked the Tigray Hotel in Addis Ababa, killing many civilians and destroying property, Dr. Negasso stated that "such terrorist acts should not be committed especially in the name of Oromos".Dr. Negaso Gidado about OLF He said there is no need for an armed struggle when there are alternative peaceful political ones. He stated,

Rebuttal to Criticism of OLF

Criticism of the OLF and its ideology has been routinely countered by the organization and many Oromo intellectuals as being Ethiopian propaganda designed to delegitimize the movement. Ethiopians, mainly from the Amhara ethnic group, have termed Oromo nationalism and self-awareness as counter to the Ethiopian state. As a result, Oromo people and organizations that associated themselves with Oromos were targeted as anti-unity and subject to oppression. The OLF was created as a defence against this type of targetted subjugation of the Oromo people.
On the issue of Ethiopian colonialism, it is noted that Emperor Menilik II officially formed the Ethiopian Empire in 1888 by declaring that all conquered land belonged to the Emperor . After doing so, the Emperor allocated Amhara landlords over the conquered southern lands (including Oromia). In this system, these landlords promoted the systematic suppression and destruction of all elements of Oromo culture while Amhara culture, language and religion was imposed on the conquered Oromo people. 
The argument by Ethiopians stating that Oromos were never colonized because some Oromo figures such as Gobana Dacche had aided Emperor Menelik II in his conquests hold no weight because these Oromo generals came from areas in northern Oromia that had been conquered decades before they were born. As such, they were assimilated into Amhara culture from birth. Also, the number of Ethiopianist Oromos is insignificant compared to the number of the Oromo population which had been conquered and colonized by Emperor Menelik.
The Somalia role is complex as on one hand you have Ogaden fighting for independence like Oromo. On the other hand, you have a radicalized opposition to Horn of Africa. In the middle of these groups were former dictator Saide Barre, who were Marxist in ideology but opportunists by nature. Saide Barre's objective was to dominate the Horn of Africa. In his quest, Saide Barre captured former OLF commanders Barisoo Wabee (Magarsaa Barii), Gadaa Gammadaa (Damisee Tacaanee), Abbaa Xiiqii (Abboomaa Mitikku), Dori Bari (Yigazu Banti), Falmataa /Umar/Caccabsaa, Faafam Dooyyoo, Irra'anaa Qacalee (Obbo Dhinsaa), Dhadacha Boroo, Daddacha Muldhataa, and Marii Galaa 

Since Saide Barre and his followers had a deep hatred towards Oromo, he asked the captured which one of you are Christian and which are Muslim. 
The Muslim Oromo refused to differentiate themselves from fellow Oromo (OLF is Secular), as a result all were executed and thrown in a mass grave April 15, 1980. The day is now commemorated by Oromos as Guyyaa Goota Oromo/Oromo Hero's Day.
Many mainstream Ethiopian intellectuals despise the OLF since it has a strong connection with Oromo people. Most often, the EPRDF spends tens of millions of money to lobby foreign countries to put OLF on their terrorist list. Numerous countries have refused to list OLF on the Terrorist Tier I listing based on the right of any people to desire and fight for nationhood. Their campaign has included dispersing mis-information about OLF massacres and terror attacks. Many of the massacres blamed on the OLF listed are usually TPLF actions to maximize conflict between oppressed nations.
Anti-Oromo campaign reaches beyond Ethiopian boundaries by Amhara and Tigray alike. Oromo refugees in Djibouti, Kenya, Puntland and South Sudan have been deported back into Ethiopia and even put into labor camps.unhcr.html One such recent event was the deportation of UNHCR registered refugee, Tesfahun Chemeda, who was deported back to Ethiopia by Kenyan authorities in 2007 and later died in an Ethiopian prison on August 24, 2013.
In Yemen, Ethiopian agents are suspected in the December 20, 2008 murder of Oromo Refugee Association leader Mr Ahmed Ibrahim Rore  The human rights report details violence towards Oromo refugees including rape. It also raises concerns over why UNHCR Yemen banned Oromo songs at Culture shows. Oromo in Yemen provided a letter detailing their suffering in Qubee 
Recent research in the United States have corroborated claims of Ethiopian Abyssinians torture, rape and extrajudicial killing of mainly Oromo, Ogaden, Anuak, Sidama and many Non-Abyssinians  Ethiopian Amhara and Tigray opposition have also been victims of torture. In Abyssinians attempts to counterattack their claims, OLF is often targeted as the cause of torture or that were rightfully victims. Similarly, Ogaden opposition ONLF is also blamed for torture and human rights violation by Ethiopian lobbyist, which has been counted by a letter from United States Senators to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi 

Notes

The OLF has offices in Washington, D.C. and Berlin. It operates a shortwave radio station, SBO (Sagalee Bilisummaa Oromoo) or VOL (Voice of Oromo Liberation), in Berlin. VOL radio transmits in Afan Oromo as well as in Amharic.
