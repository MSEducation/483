Darren Carlton Annon (born 17 February 1972 in Chelsea, London, England) is a retired English footballer. He made appearances in the Football League for Brentford, but is probably best remembered for his long spells with non-league clubs Enfield, Farnborough Town and Margate.

Career

Carshalton Athletic

A winger, Annon began his career at Isthmian League Premier Division side Carshalton Athletic and made his debut in October 1992. He made a handful of appearances during the 1992/93 season and established himself during the 1993/94 season, scoring ten goals and attracting interest from Football League clubs. Annon departed the club in March 1994.

Brentford

Annon's form for Carshalton earned him a Â£20000 move to Division Two side Brentford in March 1994. He made nine appearances and scored one goal in what remained of the 1993/94 season. Awarded the number 10 shirt for the 1994/95 season, Annon made his first appearance of the campaign as a substitute for Lee Harvey in a 1-0 home defeat to Peterborough United on 20 August 1994.

Kingstonian

Annon returned to the Isthmian League Premier Division to sign for Kingstonian in March 1996. He made seven appearances and scored three goals in what remained of the 1995/96 season.

Enfield

Annon signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Enfield in the summer of 1996. He had a successful 1996/97 season, though it ended in disappointment as the Es finished six points adrift of runaway champions Yeovil Town, despite themselves finishing 28 points clear of third-place Sutton United. Annon featured in Enfield's run to the first round proper of the FA Cup during the 1998/99 season, taking Division Two side York City to a replay before being knocked out 2-1 at Bootham Crescent. Featuring mostly as a defender, Annon made over a hundred appearances for Enfield before departing in the summer of 2000.

Farnborough Town

Annon joined Isthmian League Premier Division side Farnborough Town in the summer of 2000. He was a virtual ever-present and scored his first goal for the club in a 3-2 league win over Harrow Borough on 24 March 2001. He was again a virtual ever-present, making 42 appearances and helping Boro to a 7th place finish. Annon made 39 appearances during the 2002/03 season and the highlight came when Farnborough were drawn away to Premiership side Arsenal in the third round of the FA Cup, though Boro suffered a 5-1 defeat at Highbury. Annon departed the club at the end of the 2002/03 season. He made 129 appearances and scored two goals during his three seasons with Boro.

Margate

Annon signed for Conference side Margate in June 2003. He had a successful first season, making 49 appearances, scoring two goals and winning the Kent Senior Cup. Margate suffered demotion to the newly formed Conference South for the 2004/05 season and Annon was named as captain. He filled in at centre back and wing back throughout the early part of the season and his campaign was ended prematurely after he was stretchered off with a ruptured achilles tendon after five minutes of a 1-0 defeat to Hayes on 11 December 2004. He had made 26 appearances during the 2004/05 season, but despite the Gate suffering relegation to the Isthmian League Premier Division, they went on to win the Kent Senior Cup for the third season in succession. The length of Annon's recovery from the injury meant that he missed the start of the 2005/06 season, but he departed the club in October 2005 after returning to fitness. Annon made 75 appearances during his time with Margate and scored two goals.

Havant & Waterlooville

Annon moved back up to the Conference South to sign for Havant & Waterlooville in October 2005.

Redbridge (loan and permanent signing)

Annon joined Isthmian League Division One North side Redbridge on a month's loan on 21 December 2007. He helped the club to four wins in his four appearances and returned to Havant & Waterlooville after his loan expired. Annon signed permanently for Redbridge in February 2008. He made seven appearances during what remained of the 2007/08 season and helped the club to a 3rd place finish and a playoff first round tie with Ware. The Motormen progressed to the playoff final, but were defeated by Canvey Island. Annon left the club after the season.

Tooting & Mitcham United

Annon signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Tooting & Mitcham United in the summer of 2008. An injury suffered during pre-season kept him out of action at the beginning of the 2008/09 season and he left the club in December 2008 without making a competitive appearance.

Guildford City

Annon joined Combined Counties League Premier Division side Guildford City in December 2008. He made his debut in a 4-3 victory over Cobham, on 27 December. He managed only four appearances

Banstead Athletic

Annon moved across the Combined Counties League Premier Division to sign for Banstead Athletic in February 2009, making his debut in a 1-1 draw with Bedfont Green on 28 February. He stayed with the club until the end of the 2008/09 season, making ten appearances. Annon retired from football in the summer of 2009.
