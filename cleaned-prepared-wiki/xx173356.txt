History

Curtis Sigmon signed on WYCL at 1580 AM on April 19, 1956, with 250 watts. The station later moved to 980 AM, increased power to 1000 watts, and became WBZK. WDZK, at 99.3 FM in Chester, signed on in 1969.
For five years before the 1986-87 season, WDZK broadcast Winthrop University men's basketball.
On January 20, 1988, after 31 years as a day time-only station, WBZK broadcast at night for the first time, reducing its power after dark from 1000 watts to 290 watts. This meant better coverage of local government and sports, which included Clemson Tigers basketball and York Comprehensive High School football. The station continued to simulcast the adult contemporary music of its sister FM WDZK except for Sunday morning religious programming. York High games had been broadcast on the next day on tape; WDZK had broadcast Chester High School football for 20 years. 
In 1990, WDZK moved from a tower three miles south of Chester to a 495-foot tower, the highest in the area, 10 miles north of Chester. WDZK increased its power from 3,000 to 6,000 watts. WBZK also moved to two new towers south of Rock Hill and increased power to 3,500 watts, giving the station six times as many listeners.
In 1993, WBZK and WDZK broadcast several Clemson women's basketball games, the first area stations to do so. In the same year, WDZK broadcast Charlotte Knights baseball. 
In 1995, the Sigmon family sold WBZK-FM to the owners of WBT in nearby Charlotte, North Carolina after owning the station for 26 years. The family kept the AM, which played oldies and beach music.  
In July 2000, Carolina Metro Radio LLC (Edward A. Baker, managing member/33.33% owner) reached an agreement to purchase WBZK from York Clover Broadcasting Co. (C. Curtis Sigmon, president) for a reported sale price of $500,000. At the time of the sale, WBZK was broadcasting a beach music format.
At one time, WBZK broadcast Spanish Christian programming.
Osiris Collazos hosted the "Amanecer en America" ("Wake Up America") morning show on "La Maxima".
980 AM Inc acquired WBZK in September 2008. According to the documention of the sale, 980 AM Inc was owned by Michael B. and Dara Glinter. WBZK was exchanged for station WPYR in Louisiana with no money changing hands, according to the agreement filed with the FCC. At the same time, the station's call sign was changed to WULR.
Befoe its switch to Christian talk, WBZK's programming consisted largely of contemporary Christian music. The music was programmed on an automated basis rather than having live-on air personalities. WBZK had relatively few interruptions between songs for commercials or other non-musical items. Songs were often played back-to-back with no bumpers in between.  
According to industry reports, the Glinters have relocated to South Carolina from Florida and wanted to operate a radio station near their new home. Truth Broadcasting paid $400,000, minus a security deposit and credit for the tower lease, for WULR and began operating the station on August 16, 2010, broadcasting the same programming as WCRU in Dallas, North Carolina.
On January 1, 2013, WULR was swapped to Iglesia Nueva Vida of High Point in exchange for the license to WEGO and $46,501.73.
