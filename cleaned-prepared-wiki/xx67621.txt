Mamre (), full Hebrew name Elonei Mamre ("Oaks/Terebinths of Mamre"), refers to a Canaanite cultic shrine dedicated to the supreme, sky god of the Canaanite pantheon, El. El here is the Canaanite sky god, while Elyon is a distinct deity in what is a compound name. But in Hebrew, the two words meant 'God the Most High' Talmudic sources refer to the site as Beth Ilanim or Botnah. it was one of the three most important "fairs", or market places, in Israel. It lies approximately half way between Halhul and Hebron.

History

Bronze age pottery shards found at the site may indicate that the cultic shrine was in use from 2600-2000 BCE. Mamre, in the biblical account, was the site where Abraham came to set up his tents to camp, built an altar,Genesis, 13:18 and was brought divine tidings, in the guise of three angels, of Sarah's pregnancy,Gen.18:1-15 while elsewhereGenesis 14:13David M.

The third, Priestly recension excludes any such attachment of Abraham to the Terebinth cult.

The Herodian structure was destroyed by Bar Kochba's army, only to be rebuilt by the Roman Emperor Hadrian. Hadrian revived the fair, which had long been an important one as it took place at an intersection forming the transport and communications nub of transport of the southern Judaean mountains. This mercatus (Heb. paneguris)  or fair/market, was one of the sites chosen by Hadrian to sell remnants of Bar Kochba's defeated army into slavery.

Rabbinical tradition

Due to the pagan idolatrous nature of the rituals at the fair, Jews were forbidden to participate by their rabbis. Inequality and Discrimination in Hebron
According to the Jerusalem Talmud:

Under Christianity

Notwithstanding the rabbinic ban, by the time of Constantine's reign the market had become an informal interdenominational festival, in addition to its functions as a trade fair, frequented by Christians, Jews and pagans. The cultic shrine was made over for Christian use after Eutropia, Constantine's mother-in-law, visited it and was scandalised by its pagan character. The drawing of the site after the excavation of the German scholar A E Mader from 1926-1928, shows the Basilica and stores furthest from the Haram Ramet el-Khalil, a well altar and tree, with the market place occupying the central enclosure.Life of Constantine By Eusebius, Translated by Averil Cameron, Stuart George Hall Oxford University Press, (1999) ISBN 0-19-814917-4 p 301 The enclosure was then consecrated, Constantine had the Basilica built, dedicated to St George and the enclosure of Terebinth of Mamre roofed over, the foundations of which are still visible.Taylor, Joan E.

The fifth-century account by Sozomen (Historia Ecclesiastica Book II 4-54) is the most detailed account of the practices at Mamre during the early Christian period.
Antoninus of Piacenza in his Itinerarium, an account of his journey to the Holy Land (ca.570 CE) comments on the basilica, with its four porticos, and an unroofed atrium. Both Christians and Jews worshipped there, separated by a small screen (cancellus). The Jewish worshippers would flock there to celebrate the deposition of Jacob and David on the day after the traditional date of Christ's birthday.
