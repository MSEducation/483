History

Hamama is identified as the fifth century CE Byzantine town of Peleia. Peleia translates as "dove", and when the Arabs conquered it through the Rashidun Caliphate in the seventh century, the town received its Arabic name Hamama meaning "dove", reflecting its Byzantine roots.97-98.
Hamama was located near the site of a battle between the Crusaders and the Fatimids in 1099, resulting in a Crusader victory. Later Hamama passed into Muslim Mamluk hands, and by 1333/4 CE (734 H.) some of the income from the village formed part of  a waqf of the  tomb (turba) and madrasa  of Aqbugha b. Abd Allah in Cairo. 30. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 146 In 1432, it is reported that the Mamluk sultan Barsbay passed through the village. In this period, a renowned scholar and preacher at the al-Aqsa Mosque, Ahmad al-Shafi'i (1406–1465), was born there.
In 1596, Hamama was a village in the Ottoman nahiya of Gaza (Sanjak Gaza), with a population of 462. It paid taxes on goats and beehives.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 142. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 98. The seventeenth-century traveller al-Nabulsi  recorded that the tomb (qabr) of Shaykh Ibrahim Abi Arqub was located in the village, while the Sufi traveller al-Bakri al-Siddiqi visited Hamama in the mid-eighteenth century, after leaving al-Jura. 98. 
Hamama appears on Jacotin's map drawn-up during Napoleon's invasion in 1799, though its position is interchanged with that of Majdal. Jacotin's Map of Palestine. D.H. p. 161. In 1863, the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village, and noted a mosque constructed with ancient materials. 129 -130
Under the British Mandate in Palestine, a village council was established to administer local affairs, and Hamama had a mosque, and two primary schools for boys and girls established in 1921. In 1946, the boys' school had an enrollment of 338, and the girls' school an enrollment of 46. Its inhabitants engaged primarily in fishing and agriculture, cultivating grain, citrus, apricots, almonds, figs, olives, watermelons, and cantaloupes. Due to the existence of sand dunes in the north part of the town, trees were planted on parts of those lands to prevent soil erosion.99 During the Mandate time, the village was visited by inspectors from the Department of Antiquities who noted two mosques. One of these, known as Shaykh Ibrahim Abi Arqub, included marble columns and capitals in the iwan. The other mosque, known as Shaykh Hamid, also incorporated marble fragments. Neither of these mosques have survived. 146

1948 War

Hamama was first drawn into the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, after a group of workers from the town laboring in the adjacent fields were struck by Jewish settlers from Nitzanim on January 22, 1948, leaving fifteen Arabs wounded. Two days later, a unit from Nitzanim opened fire on Hamama residents, killing one, and on February 17, a group of workers waiting for a bus on the road between Isdud and the town were fired upon, wounding two.
It was captured by Israel from the Egyptian Army in the first stage of Operation Yoav on October 28. By then several refugees from nearby towns were in Hamama, most of them, along with many of Hamama's residents, fled with the withdrawing Egyptian troops.220, quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.99.
At the end of November 1948, Coastal Plain District troops carried  out  sweeps of the villages around and to the south of Majdal.  Hamama was one of the villages named in the orders to the IDF battalions and engineers platoon, that the villagers were to be  expelled to Gaza, and the IDF troops were "to prevent their return by destroying their villages." The path leading to the village was to be mined. The IDF troops were ordered to carry out the operation "with determination, accuracy and energy"., 19:55 hours, 25 Nov. 1948, IDFA (=Israeli Defence Forces and Defence Ministry Archive) 6308\49\\141. Cited in Morris (2004), p.517 The operation took place on 30 November. The troops found "not a living soul" in Hamama. However, the destruction of the villages was not completed immediately due to the dampness of the houses and the insufficient amount of explosives.Coastal Plain  HQ to Southern Front\Operations, 30 Nov. 1948, IDFA 1978\50\\1; and Southern Front\Operations to General Staff Divisions, 2. Dec. 1948, IDFA 922\75\\1025. Cited in Morris (2004), p.518
