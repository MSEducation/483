However, Lithuania has not yet met all the economic criteria necessary to join the euro.

Status

All members of the European Union, except Denmark and the UK, are required by treaty to join the euro once certain economic criteria have been met. In March 2006, Lithuania requested that the European Commission and the European Central Bank conduct an assessment on their readiness to adopt the euro. The Commission's report found that while Lithuania met 4 of the 5 criteria, their average annual inflation was 2.7%, exceeding the limit of 2.6%. As a result, the Commission concluded that "there should be no change at present to Lithuania's status as a Member State with a derogation."
According to figures from the Bank of Lithuania, Lithuania had met 4 out of the 5 criteria by October 2013, the exception being the government deficit of 3.2% of GDP, exceeding the limit of 3.0%.  If Lithuania gets a positive evaluation, the date for switchover to the euro and the fixed exchange will be set in the summer.

It was created by the sculptor Antanas Å½ukauskas. and will subsequently be subject to an assessment by the ECB and the European Commission for its compliance with all euro adoption convergence criteria in its biennial report in May/June 2014. If approved, Lithuania will adopt the euro on 1 January 2015.
