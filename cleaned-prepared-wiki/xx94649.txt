The Calgary Tower is a 191-metre (626 feet) free standing observation tower in Downtown Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Originally called the Husky Tower, it was conceived as a joint venture between Marathon Realty Company Limited and Husky Oil as part of an urban renewal plan and to celebrate Canada's centennial of 1967. The tower was built at a cost of $3,500,000 and weighs approximately 10,900 tonnes, of which 60% is below ground.  It opened to the public on June 30, 1968 as the tallest structure in Calgary, and the tallest in Canada outside of Toronto.  It was renamed the Calgary Tower in 1971.
The building was a founding member of the World Federation of Great Towers.

The Husky Tower officially opened on June 28–30, 1968, in three separate ceremonies.  It had two elevators that could take visitors to the observation level in just over a minute at a cost of $1 for adults and 50 cents for children under 13. The observation level featured a lounge/restaurant called the Hitching Post.
Marathon Realty acquired a controlling interest in the tower in 1970. The structure was formally renamed the Calgary Tower on November 1, 1971 as a tribute to the citizens of the city.

The tower underwent significant renovations between 1987 and 1990.  The upper levels of the tower were closed in January 1987 for five months of construction that saw a $2.4 million refurbishment of the upper levels of the tower and the addition of a souvenir shop and a revolving restaurant that could complete a 360-degree turn in 45 minutes.  The lower level was renovated over the course of a year in 1990, and featured the construction of a glass rotunda to serve as the new lobby of the building.
A natural gas-fired cauldron was constructed at the top of the tower by Canadian Western Natural Gas in October 1987 as a gift to celebrate the 1988 Winter Olympics.  The torch, which consumes  per hour, was first lit on February 13, 1988 when the Games opened, and burned 24 hours a day throughout.  It continues to be re-ignited for various special events, including Canada Day.
