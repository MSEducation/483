M-86 is an east–west state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan  in the southern portion of the Lower Peninsula. The highway starts at Business US Highway 131 (BUS US 131) and M-60 in Three Rivers and ends at US Highway 12 (US 12) near Coldwater. In between, it crosses farm country and runs along a section of the Prairie River. Following a highway originally numbered M-7, the roadway was renumbered M-86 in 1940. It has been a part of the state highway system at least since 1927. Two other roadways carried the M-86 designation in the 1920s. Two bridges along the road are eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NHRP).

Route description

M-86 begins in Three Rivers at a junction with BUS US 131 and M-60. From there the road travels south out of town on Main Street and across the St. Joseph River. After crossing the river, the highway runs through a residential area of town and turns eastward into rural farm lands. M-86 crosses the Prairie River and follows Burr Oak Street into the community of Centreville. The highway switches to follow Main Street through downtown Centreville; east of downtown, Main Street curves along a bend in the river, and it runs parallel to the river out of town. As part of its support of the state highway system, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the traffic levels along the roads it maintains. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the vehicles using a segment of roadway on a typical day of the year. In 2009, MDOT measured 7,642 vehicles including 138 trucks along M-86 in Centreville, the highest traffic levels along the whole highway. As the highway leaves town, it passes by the north side of Lake Templene, and Sand Lake near Nottawa before meeting M-66.
From the junction, M-86 and M-66 run concurrently to the north for about 

History

Previous designations

Upon its inception in 1921, a very different M-86 was routed along a portion of present day M-66 from M-46 at Six Lakes northward to Remus, ending at M-24 (modern M-20).

Current designation

By the end of 1927, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) had designated a highway numbered M-7 between Three Rivers and Centreville.
In 1940, at the same time all single-digit highway numbers were renumbered in the state, the M-86 designation replaced M-7. This incarnation of M-86 followed its present-day routing. Near Nottawa, M-86 ran concurrently with the contemporary M-78 north and east to Colon. The routing has remain unchanged since.

Historic bridges

M-86 currently uses two bridges eligible for listing on the NRHP. The span over the St. Joseph River in Three Rivers was built in 1903. It is a five-span concrete arch bridge constructed to look as though created from stacked masonry blocks. The current railings were added in 1952 by the MSHD during a repair project.
