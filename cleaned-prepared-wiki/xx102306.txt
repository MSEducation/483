The McDonnell Douglas MD-12 was an aircraft design study undertaken by the McDonnell Douglas company in the 1990s for a "superjumbo" aircraft, first conceived as a larger trijet, then stretched to a 4-engine airliner.  It was to be similar in size to the Boeing 747, but with more passenger capacity.  However, the MD-12 received no orders and was canceled.  McDonnell Douglas then studied larger MD-11 derivatives named MD-XX without proceeding.

Design and development

Background

McDonnell Douglas studied improved, stretched versions of the trijet MD-11, named MD-12X"MDC brochures for undeveloped versions of the MD-11 and MD-12." md-eleven. Retrieved: April 14, 2008. with a possible lower-front passenger deck with panoramic windows."MD-11 page." Airliners. Retrieved: October 18, 2007. 92-94. The MDC board of directors agreed in October 1991 to offer the MD-12X design to airlines.  MD-12X had a length of .  In November 1991, McDonnell Douglas and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation signed a Memorandum of Understanding to form a company to produce the new design.  The new company would have McDonnell Douglas as the majority shareholder (51%) with Taiwan Aerospace (40%) and other Asian companies (9%) having the remaining shares.

MD-12

In late 1991, McDonnell Douglas made a move to separate civil and military divisions in a bid to raise the estimated $4 billion development costs needed to develop the MD-12X trijet. Separating the costly military C-17 airlifter development which had been a drain on the company's resources, from the profit-making production of the MD-80 and MD-11 airliners would make it easier to attract foreign investors for the MD-12X. The  restructuring of the company into McDonnell as a military manufacturer and Douglas as a civil operation would involve offering minority shareholdings in the Douglas concern."MD-12 divides Douglas." Flight International, November 13–19, 1991.
The design grew into the much larger MD-12 with four engines and two passenger decks extending the length of the fuselage.  The length of the main MD-12 variants was  high.
McDonnell Douglas unveiled its MD-12 design in April 1992. The design was similar in concept to the Airbus A3XX and Boeing NLA, and it would have been larger than the Boeing 747 with which it would have directly competed.  Douglas Aircraft had also studied a smaller double-decker design in the 1960s. "Proposed double deck DC-10 design in 1965." webshots. Retrieved: July 15, 2011. McDonnell Douglas DC-10. Miami, Florida: World Transport Press, 2000. ISBN 1-892437-04-X.  
The first flight of the MD-12 was to take place in late 1995, with delivery in 1997.  Despite aggressive marketing and initial excitement, especially in the aviation press, no orders were placed for the aircraft. MDC lacked the resources after Taiwan Aerospace left the project.  A new double deck widebody has proved to be extremely expensive and complex to develop, even for the remaining aerospace giants Boeing and Airbus, although the massive Airbus A380, a similar concept to the MD-12, was later brought to fruition."Airbus will lose €4.8bn because of A380 delays."

MD-XX

With the MD-12 program over, McDonnell Douglas focused on 300 to 400–seat MD-11 derivatives.  At the 1996 Farnborough International Air Show, the company presented plans for a new trijet with high-seating and long-range named "MD-XX"."McDonnell Douglas Unveils New MD-XX Trijet Design."  McDonnell Douglas, September 4, 1996.  The MD-XX was offered in two variants; MD-XX Stretch with a longer fuselage and MD-XX LR for longer range.  Both MD-XX variant designs had . However, the MDC board of directors decided to end the MD-XX program in October 1996, stating the financial investment for the program was too large for the company.

Variants

The MD-12 was offered in a few proposed variants.
