History

Part of the colony of Virginia, Surry County was formed from a portion of James City County in 1652. It was named for the English county of Surrey. It included all of the portion of James City County (formed in 1634) that was located south of the James River. Surry County initially had the Lawne's Creek and Southwark parishes of the Church of England.
Nearby, in 1665, Arthur Allen built a Jacobean brick house.  It later became known as Bacon's Castle because it was occupied as a fort or "castle" during Bacon's Rebellion against the Royal Governor, Sir William Berkeley in 1676. (Nathaniel Bacon never lived at Bacon's Castle, but resided at Curles Neck Plantation in Henrico County about 30 miles upriver on the northern bank of the James River).
The first town of Cobham was established in 1691 where Gray's Creek empties into the James River.  Neighboring Sussex County was formed from the southwestern end of Surry County in 1754.
For more than 350 years, Surry County has depended on an agricultural economy.  It has guarded its heritage.  It is located a short ride from the Jamestown Ferry, with convenient access to Virginia's Historic Triangle, featuring Jamestown, Williamsburg, and Yorktown, linked by the National Park Service's Colonial Parkway. The county has several small towns, significant James River plantations, and a state park.

Dog fighting investigation

Beginning on April 25, 2007, Surry County Sheriff Harold D. Brown and part-time county Commonwealth's Attorney (prosecutor) Gerald G. Poindexter led a high-profile dog fighting investigation.  Authorities investigating Davon T. Boddie, 26, on a narcotics issue found evidence of dog fighting activities at a home and property in Surry County where he lived.  It was owned by his cousin, then Atlanta Falcons NFL-football player Michael Vick. Officials confiscated 66 dogs, 55 of which were pit bulls, and other evidence. An ESPN source alleged that Vick was a "heavyweight" in dog fighting and had been known to wager $40,000 on the outcome of a single fight.
By August 20, 2007, all the defendants charged in Federal court, including Vick, had agreed to guilty pleas under plea bargain agreements.  They were sentenced to terms ranging from 6 to 23 months, to be served in Federal prisons. The abused dogs were placed in foster or adoptive homes.     
On 26 February 2009, Vick was approved for release to home confinement.  He was released on 21 May 2009 to be confined for the remainder of his 23-month term of imprisonment under home confinement.
