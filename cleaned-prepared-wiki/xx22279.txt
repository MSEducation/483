German submarine ''U-553 was a Type VIIC U-boat built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine'' for service during World War II.

History

Her keel was laid down 21 November 1939, by Blohm + Voss in Hamburg as 'werk' 529. She was launched on 7 November 1940 and commissioned on 23 December, with Kapit√§nleutnant Karl Thurmann in command. He was captain for her entire career.
Her service began with training under the 7th U-boat Flotilla and moved on to operations on 1 April 1941. She then transferred to the 3rd flotilla on 1 December 1942. She was a member of 10 wolfpacks. She moved from Kiel in Germany to Bergen in Norway in April 1941.

1st patrol

The boat departed Bergen on 19 April 1941 and headed for the Atlantic via the gap between the Faeroe and Shetland Islands. She arrived at her new base of St. Nazaire in occupied France on 2 May 1941 after suffering serious engine trouble.

2nd patrol

Departing St. Nazaire on 7 June, she achieved success north of the Azores, by sinking the Susan Maersk (she went down in 90 seconds)  both on 12 June 1941.

3rd, 4th and 5th patrols

Her next three sorties met with mixed fortune; her third patrol saw no success, despite ranging far and wide over the north Atlantic.

The boat's fifth patrol took her toward the eastern Canadian/US coast where she succeeded in damaging the Diala on 15 January 1942

6th and 7th patrols

The boat's sixth patrol took her from St. Nazaire as far north as the Faeroe Islands. It was unsuccessful.
Outing number seven saw the submarine penetrate the Gulf of St. Lawrence where she sank two ships; the Leto was sent to the bottom of the Atlantic.

8th patrol

The boat's eighth patrol began with her departure from St. Nazaire on 19 July and to which she returned on 17 September after 61 days at sea, her longest. In that time, she damaged the Belgian Soldier off Newfoundland (classed as sunk by U-553)

9th patrol

Her last full patrol commenced on 23 November 1942; she sank the Charles L D on 9 December 1942. She returned to France, but this time La Pallice on 18 December.

Loss

Her tenth and final sortie began with her departure from La Pallice on 16 January 1943. On the 20th, she sent a radio message: "Sehrohr unklar" (periscope unready for action), and was never heard from again. She had suffered no casualties to her crew until lost with all hands. She most probably sank because of technical problems and was officially declared missing on 28 January 1943.
