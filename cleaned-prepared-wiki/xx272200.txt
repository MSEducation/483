Career

2007–2009: Early work

Darcey-Alden first broke into the world of acting around 2007, appearing in small bits on the British stage and television, including her stage debut in Aladdin, directed by Peter Duncan for the Oxford Playhouse and followed by an uncredited cameo role in the 2008 mini-series Tess of the D'Urbervilles.

She began training in specialised dancing much earlier in 2005, with the Dance 10 Theatre School within Edward Feild Primary School in Kidlington. Oxford Mail. 19 October 2009. Retrieved 1 October 2013.
In 2009, she appeared in her first guest-starring role as Mary in one episode of Robin Hood and in select episodes as Emma Walker in Holby City—for the BBC, respectively. She auditioned for the latter part earlier in June that year, accompanied by her mother, and was cast at the age of 9. Commenting on the experience, Darcey-Alden said: "It was very entertaining and a very good experience. I really, really enjoyed it. Jade Jackson and Patsy Kensit were really nice, funny and entertaining. I want to be like Patsy Kensit when I am older because she is such a good actress. I am a big Holby City fan and I am really excited about seeing it on the television. All my friends and family are coming to watch it with me."
That year, she appeared in further stage credits, including Adrian Noble's musical production of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang for the New Theatre Oxford which was a revamped production of the original 2002 London productionChitty Chitty Bang Bang at the New Theatre, Oxford.

She later commented at a 2013 LeakyCon panel in London on which form of media she preferred more—theatre, TV or film: "I love both. I actually started out doing theatre first and worked my way into TV and film. ... I don't mind either, really.

2009–2011: Harry Potter

Of course, Darcey-Alden's most notable role came in December 2009, when she attended an open audition for the latest Harry Potter installment (a year before she was actually needed due to the producers' decision to split the book into two parts). In January 2010, she was called back for a second audition (known as a recall). She subsequently received a screen test with then 13-year-old Benedict Clarke (who would be cast as young Severus Snape) at Leavesden Studios and just a few weeks later, she was contacted by the producers and was told that she received the part of young Lily Evans, cast at age 10, in the commercially successful Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.'

In the film, Darcey-Alden appears in a flashback sequence as Harry's mother in her schooldays and reveals how she befriended Snape as child, which is crucial in explaining the back story of the shady professor and his complex relationship to Harry's deceased parents, particularly his bitter resentment to his father James. Dir. David Yates. Warner Bros. Pictures, 2011. DVD. 211. (See Notes.)
It was revealed in a 2011 article for the Oxford Mail that years before landing the part Darcey-Alden was tipped for future success by her agents at Enfield, London-based casting and theatrical agency A&J Management, although her parents decided to not treat her passion for acting seriously until she was more mature. Despite this, she resisted her mother for a chance in the business, especially for a part in Harry Potter, a role which her mother initially did not believe she would eventually win. In the same article, it was further reported that she was not allowed to tell her close friends of her part in Potter as she left school for Leavesden Studios and Hatfield House to film her scenes in 2010, where she met then 21-year-old actor Daniel Radcliffe on her first day on set. She was quoted: "I am still trying to get over that I am actually in Harry Potter. When I got the part, I was so happy I was speechless. It was the best time of my life. It was very funny. Everyone was so friendly to me and it was really fun. At first, it was really difficult to keep the secret. But when my friends did find out, they were so happy for me and supported me all the way through it."Harry Potter Actors Look Back During Panel. LeakyNews. 2 July 2013. Retrieved 20 October 2013.
At a 2013 LeakyCon panel in Portland, Oregon, Darcey-Alden further elaborated on her meeting with Potter co-star Daniel Radcliffe. She said: 
She also mentioned in the same panel session that she met Dame Maggie Smith and was quoted, jokingly: "She spoke to me. It's not my fault." 
She later said in detail: 
Filming her scenes along with Benedict Clarke (young Snape), Ariella Paradise (young Petunia Dursely), Alfie McIlwain (young James) and Rohan Gotobed (young Sirius Black) took place in April 2010. 'When exactly did you film the scenes in DH2? (like, month/year).' Tumblr. 15 January 2012. Retrieved 25 October 2013.
According to Darcey-Alden and Clarke at a 2013 LeakyCon cast junket in London, production alternated between sets at Leavesden Studios and on location shooting by the River Lea in the gardens of Hatfield Park near Hatfield House—both set in Hertfordshire, respectively. Of the river scene in particular, Clarke elaborated by saying:  Darcey-Alden added: "We only did half-and-half at Leavesden. ... There was the actual Hatfield House there and we got to have a look around and it was really beautiful."
Shooting only lasted four days where one scene was shot per day. 'How long did it take to film your scenes in Harry Potter?' Tumblr. 13 August 2011. Retrieved 20 October 2013.
To satisfy the look of her character as described in the books, Darcey-Alden is naturally red haired although she was required to wear blue contact lenses to match Daniel Radcliffe's eyes given her eyes are brown. 'Do you know why they decided to not give the young Lily green eyes?' Tumblr. 13 August 2011. Retrieved 20 October 2013. In the novels, Harry is described as having his mother's eyes, which are in fact green although Radcliffe never sported any colour-correcting contacts in the films due to a negative reaction to them; J.K. Rowling later commented on this by saying it was not an absolute need that Harry have green eyes in the films, as long as there was a resemblance between his and his mother's.J.K. Rowling discusses why Harry's eyes didn't have to be green. Hypable. 8 November 2011. Retrieved 20 October 2013. However, the method of using blue contacts ultimately backfired and Darcey-Alden's natural eye colour showed through when captured on camera. For an unknown reason, this error was not digitally corrected in post-production. 'Did anyone else notice that in DH, they edited young Snape's eyes from blue to black?' Tumblr. 31 December 2011. Retrieved 20 October 2013.
When later asked by a fan of what it was like to be apart of a popular movie franchise, Darcey-Alden commented: "I'm not famous, people don't recognise me. I'm just a normal crazy 12 year old who was very lucky to be in such a huge film."Darcey-Alden, Ellie. 'Whats the best thing about being famous?' Twitter. 8 February 2012. Retrieved 25 October 2013.
