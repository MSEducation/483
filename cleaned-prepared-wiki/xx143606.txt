Parkview High School, the "Home of the Panthers," is located in Lilburn, Georgia in Gwinnett County. The current principal is Mr. David T. Smith.

History

During the early 1970s, Gwinnett County, Georgia led the USA in growth. This phenomenal growth rate produced overcrowding in its school systems, leaving South Gwinnett High School and Berkmar High School too overcrowded in accommodating excess student populations. In 1975, construction began on a new school. The students chose a panther to be their school mascot, with orange and white as their school's colors, blue being an accent color. The doors opened in 1976 with the initial Principal Bartow Jenkins.
The school expanded, both in construction as well as number of students, until it was filled above capacity in the early-to-mid-1990s. In 2007, Parkview took over the then adjacent Trickum Middle School in order to create more space for its rapidly expanding population. The old Trickum Middle School building was reinstated as "The 9th Grade Academy," and many Freshmen courses were relocated there. In moving classes to the new building, the school eliminated all of the nearly 70 trailers that had been used as annex partition on the school's property for the past decade.

Academic Decathlon

For the first time in the school's history, Parkview's Academic Decathlon (PAD) is going on to the United States Academic Decathlon's (USAD) 2013 Nationals Competition in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This is the first time in school history, because in recent years, the team hasn't done that well to beat long-time rival, Berkmar High School, at state. But even though PAD was runner-up, because of the subjectivity of the Interview and Speech portions of the competition, The PAGE (Professional Association of Georgia Educators) Foundation's Academic Decathlon, or GAD, has decided to send Parkview to Nationals, alongside Berkmar. Parkview placed first over-all in district, second over-all at state. In the 2013-2014 competitive season, Parkview's Academic Decathlon won first over-all in district and third over-all in state. Parkview's Academic Decathlon is currently lead by coaches Ms. Melodie Carr and Ms. Amy Hammond.
