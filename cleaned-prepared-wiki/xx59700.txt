T. F. Green Airport (officially Theodore Francis Green Memorial State Airport)T.F. Green International Airport 
T.F. Green Airport is a regional airport serving the FAA's New England Region within the FAA System Plan. The airport is the largest and most active airport among the six operated by the Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC).

History

T.F. Green was dedicated on September 27, 1931, as Hillsgrove State Airport, drawing the largest crowd that had attended a public function in the country until then. In 1933 the Rhode Island State Airport Terminal was built on Airport Road, then called Occupatuxet Road.—In 1931 Hillsgrove State Airport, on Airport Road, then called Occupatuxet Road, opened, the first state-owned and operated in the United State In 1938 the airport got its current name; it then had three 3000-ft concrete runways.
The Army Air Force took control from 1942 to 1945, using it for flight training. The February 1947 diagram shows runways 5, 10 and 16 all 4000 ft long; in April 1951 runway 5 was 5000 ft and 5R was under construction. A few years later 5R was 5466 ft which it remained until extended to 6466 ft around 1967.
The April 1957 OAG shows 26 weekday departures: 11 Eastern, 10 American, 4 United and one National. Nonstops didn't reach beyond Boston and Newark until 1959 when Eastern started a DC-7B nonstop to Washington, which was the longest until United started Cleveland in 1968 and Chicago in 1970 and Eastern started Miami in 1969 and Atlanta in 1970. The first jets were Mohawk BAC-111s in 1966.
A new terminal opened on Post Road; in the 1990s it was rebuilt, expanding to 18 gates, and in 1997 four gates were added. Airlines added flights to T.F. Green, including Air Canada,
After the September 11th attacks, T.F. Green, like most airports in the United States, faced a decrease in passengers and fewer flights from American Airlines (which once flew to Chicago O'Hare and Dallas-Fort Worth Airport), Spirit, and SATA. In 2013 the Providence Metropolitan Area is the largest MSA in the United States not served by American Airlines or any of its subsidiaries.
Since the HNTB-designed Bruce Sundlun Terminal opened in 1996, T.F. Green became more congested due to increased traffic and post-9/11 security changes.T.F. Green Airport Modernization Renovations followed, including expansion of baggage rooms to accommodate a new In-Line Explosive Detection System (EDS) Baggage Handling System, expanded security screening checkpoints, more concessions and ticket counters, and expansion of RIAC offices on the second and third floors.
Although T.F. Green's longest runway is , the airport has seen several wide-body jets. Cheaper fees at T.F. Green make it an appealing choice for sports teams and entertainers visiting the area.
T.F. Green was visited by Air Force One, a Boeing 747, on October 25, 2010,

Runway expansion

The Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) writes (in 2001)
While some expansion proponents claim extending the main runway would bring in an estimated $138 million over 13 years, doing so could consume 204 houses, at least ten businesses, and large areas of wetlands. More recent studies indicate substantially decreased enplanements due in-part to soaring fuel costs, and easier access to Logan International Airport since completion of improvements to the Southeast Expressway, Third Harbor Tunnel, bus services between T.F. Green and Logan, as well as the introduction of low cost carriers at Logan such as JetBlue.
The Rhode Island Airport Corporation owns some residential property on the eastern side of the airport near the Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting building. Most homes on Cedar Swamp Road and Pembroke Avenue have since been demolished, likely to make way for future expansion.
On March 1, 2012 TF Green Airport was given the go-ahead to expand the runway and improve the safety of the secondary runway. The Warwick City Council unanimously voted to approve the expansion, and drop the suit against the RIAC. President Obama signed a bill saying the project will be federally funded. The project will take approximately 2–3 years.

1999 runway incursion

On December 6, 1999 at approximately 8:35pm Eastern Standard Time, a runway incursion occurred involving United Airlines flight 1448 (a Boeing 757) and FedEx Express flight 1662 (a Boeing 727) on Runway 5R/23L.  Shortly after landing on Runway 5R, United 1448 was instructed by the air traffic control tower to taxi to the gate, part of the instructions including crossing Runway 16.  Due to the low-visibility conditions that night, the pilots became disoriented and turned down the wrong taxiway, which led them back towards the active runway they had just arrived on. The tower controller, unaware of United's mistake, cleared FedEx 1662 for takeoff on Runway 5R.  United 1448 then confirmed with the controller that they should cross the runway in front of them (neither party aware that they were in fact not near Runway 16) and the aircraft continued moving towards Runway 5R/23L.
United 1448 sounding confused then radioed that they were near taxiway Kilo, and as they re-entered Runway 5R/23L, reported that "somebody just took off" overhead, referring to FedEx 1662 that had indeed just become airborne in very close proximity to the United aircraft.  However, the controller appeared not to take this seriously, stating, "you shouldn't be anywhere near Kilo", and advised the United 1448 crew to hold position. United 1448 then informed the tower that they were now on an active runway, which they mistakenly believed to be 23R/5L (inactive at the time). A moment later the pilot corrected himself, stating that they were on 5R/23L. United 1448's crew was told again to stand by, so the aircraft remained idle at the intersection of the active runway, while the controller cleared MetroJet 2998 for takeoff on the same runway. The United 1448 pilot immediately interjected to insist that the plane was on the active runway, to which the controller belligerently denied telling them it was not an active runway. Meanwhile, the MetroJet pilot having heard the exchange realized there was confusion over the whereabouts of United 1448 and refused the takeoff clearance stating, "We're staying clear of all runways until we figure this out".
Despite all this confusion, the controller again cleared MetroJet 2998 for take off on Runway 5R. They again refused to accept the clearance for take-off until the United 1448 was confirmed to have arrived at the gate. Once United 1448 was confirmed to be at the gate, MetroJet 2998 finally departed on Runway 5R.
The US Airways crew operating Flight 2998 were praised by a US Air spokesperson for their actions of avoiding a near-disaster. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board followed and while no fault was assigned to the controller, she was required to undergo retraining before returning to service.  The pilots were debriefed by United, received additional training and were returned to service.
Part of the confusion was United 1448's inability to correctly identify the runway they were on. During the radio exchanges, United 1448 refers to 23L/5R as 23R/5L and vice versa. Runway 23R/5L has been closed since this incident and is now taxiway V.

2007 CRJ accident

On December 16, 2007, Air Wisconsin (US Airways Express) flight 3758, a CRJ-200 arriving from Philadelphia, departed the left side of runway 5 after a hard landing by an unstabilized approach. Although the aircraft sustained substantial damage, none of the 31 passengers and crew aboard were injured.
