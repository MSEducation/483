CATEGORIES: Living people, American environmentalists

Trained as a veterinarian and ecologist (B.Sc. Cornell, V.M.D. UPenn, M.E.S. Yale), Dr. Gary Tabor has worked as a catalyst to champion large landscape conservation efforts in North America and abroad for over 30 years, including 15 years as a leader within the U.S. environmental  philanthropic community. 

Current activities

Dr. Tabor is the founder and Executive Director of the Center for Large Landscape ConservationCLLC website 2009 (see link below), which was established in 2007. Focused on the American West, the Center creates strategies to solve natures large scale challenges such as climate change, habitat fragmentation and loss of vital goods and services provided by healthy ecosystems.  Through collaboration the Center seeks to build an enduring constituency for large landscape conservation. By acting as an inter-organizational catalyst to fuel scientific and policy collaboration, the Center plays a unique role in advancing wildlife corridor and connectivity conservation. It achieves its mission by:

Professional Philanthropic Activities

Dr. Tabor has served as the Environment Program Officer for the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, the Associate Director of the Henry P. Kendall Foundation, co-founder of Animal Grantmakers and the Australian Environmental Grantmakers Network, and Yellowstone to Yukon Program Director for the Wilburforce Foundation.conservationmedicine.htm   He has served as Canadian grants advisor to the Turner Foundation, and played a major role in facilitating U.S. philanthropic investments in Canadian conservation for nearly two decades.  From 1999 to 2006, Dr. Tabor established and managed the Wilburforce Foundation's Yellowstone to Yukon field office in Bozeman, Montana.  His work also includes the design of international conservation trusts for biodiversity protection for USAID, and the Global Environmental Facility of the World Bank (the Bwindi Impenetrable and Mgahninga Forest Mountain Gorilla Fund and the Baltic American Partnership Fund).
Recently, Dr. Tabor was selected as one of 100 thought leaders worldwide to participate in the design of a new National Academy of Sciences' Keck Futures Initiative to develop a research and policy agenda for advancing ecosystem services.  This effort will create a new U.S. governmental funding source to facilitate the design and implementation of ecosystem service efforts.

Conservation Achievements

Dr. Tabor's conservation achievements include establishing Makerere University's Biological Field Station in Kibale Forest, Uganda, the facilitation of the establishment of Kibale National Park in Uganda; co-founding the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation initiative; co-founding the New England Grassroots Environment Fund; co-founding the Consortium for Conservation Medicine with Wildlife Trust, attending Harvard Medical School Center for Health and the Global Environment, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University; catalyzing the Western Governors Association wildlife corridor initiative; and co-founding Patagonia's (clothing) Freedom to Roam campaign  He recently conducted the first ever Congo Basin-wide evaluation of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Great Ape Conservation Fund.
Dr. Tabor currently serves on the Advisory Team of the Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative.  He is also a Senior Fellow, University of Montana Center for Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Co-Director, Roundtable for the Crown of the Continent.  Dr. Tabor is helping to create a Network of Large Landscape Practitioners, in conjunction with the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, an operating foundation.  This effort seeks to build capacity, leverage resources, and enhance the policy influence of North America's large landscape conservation community.  He also assisted the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative in the design and publication of its 2010 report "Moving Toward Climate Change Adaptation: The promise of the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative for addressing the region's vulnerability to Climate Disruption."
Dr. Tabor is a published conservation scientist see "Representative Publications" and is a former elected member to the Board of Governors of the Society for Conservation Biology.    He is a member of the Phi Zeta, the Veterinarian Honor Society, and was awarded a prestigious Henry Luce Scholar grant.
