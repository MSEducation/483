Richmond International Airport  is a joint civil-military public airport, in Sandston, Virginia, an unincorporated community (within Henrico County). 
Richmond International Airport is the busiest airport in central Virginia. The airport is about 7 miles (11Â km) southeast of downtown Richmond, the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia.



Seven commercial air carriers currently serve RIC, with non-stop flights to 20 destinations, and connecting flights to other countries. An estimated record 3,630,000 passengers used RIC in 2007. In January 2012, following its merger with AirTran, Southwest Airlines hinted that they would begin flights to Richmond
To help accommodate the current and proposed increase in passengers and air service, RIC has embarked on a major expansion program. It has increased the number of gates, added parking spaces (to 8,000), and created a new terminal roadway and air traffic control tower. The project features major renovations of the terminal building, including upper-level departures and lower-level arrivals, the construction of a central utility plant, and the widening of security checkpoints. Construction on the renovated two-level terminal was completed in spring 2007, and was designed by Gresham, Smith & Partners.
In 2004, Richmond International Airport handled over 57,000 tons of cargo. Cargo services offered at the airport include more than  of apron space. The airport is designated a Foreign Trade Zone. Because of its position on the Eastern Seaboard, cargo transit via RIC is on the rise. Goods shipped out of the metropolitan Richmond area can reach 50% of the U.S. population within 24 hours.

History

The airport was dedicated as Richard Evelyn Byrd Flying Field in 1927 in honor of aviator Richard E. Byrd, brother of then Gov. Harry F. Byrd. Charles Lindbergh attended the dedication ceremony. Although the facility was in Henrico County, Richmond Mayor John Fulmer Bright was instrumental in the creation of Byrd Field, which was initially owned by the City of Richmond.
The current president and CEO of the airport is Jon Mathiasen. It is owned and operated by the Capital Region Airport Commission, a Commonwealth-created governmental agency overseen by representatives of Chesterfield Hanover, and Henrico counties, and the City of Richmond.
A terminal building designed by Marcellus Wright and Son was completed in 1950.
The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 43 weekday departures: 22 on Eastern, 10 Piedmont, 5 American, 4 National, and 2 Capital.

Accidents and incidents

Virginia Air National Guard

Until October 2007, the 192d Fighter Wing (192 FW), an Air Combat Command (ACC)-gained unit of the Virginia Air National Guard, maintained an Air National Guard station, operating F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft from the airport. In late 2007, pursuant to BRAC 2005 action, the 192 FW relinquished its F-16C and F-16D aircraft, which moved to Langley AFB (now Joint Base Langley-Eustis), and integrated with the Regular Air Force as an associate unit to the 1st Fighter Wing (1 FW) flying the F-22 Raptor. The former Richmond International Airport Air National Guard Station property was transferred to the Department of the Army in support of Army Reserve and Virginia Army National Guard activities.
