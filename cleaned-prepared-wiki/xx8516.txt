[[New Zealand Defence Force]]

CATEGORIES: Military of New Zealand, Military units and formations established in 1990

The New Zealand Defence Force (Maori: Te Ope Kaatua o Aotearoa, "Line of Defence of New Zealand") consists of three services: the Royal New Zealand Navy; the New Zealand Army; and the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and is commanded and headed by the Chief of Defence Force (CDF)
 the Commander-in-Chief of the NZDF was Sir Jerry Mateparae, Governor-General of New Zealand, who exercised power on the advice of the Minister of Defence, Jonathan Coleman, under the Defence Act 1990. The Chief of Defence Force was Lieutenant-General Rhys Jones, who also acted as the primary military adviser to the Minister of Defence; Lt Gen. Jones was replaced by Major General Tim Keating, previously the Vice Chief of Defence Force on 31 January 2014.
New Zealand's armed forces have three defence policy objectives: to defend New Zealand against low-level threats; to contribute to regional security; and to play a part in global security efforts. New Zealand considers its own national defence needs to be modest, due to its geographical isolation and benign relationships with neighbours.''Background Note: New Zealand US Department of State As of September 2008 approximately 600 NZDF personnel served overseas in the South Pacific, Asia and Middle East areas.

History of the armed services

Militia (1845–1886)

After the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 New Zealand's security was dependent on British Imperial Troops deployed from Australia and other parts of the empire. By 1841 the settlers, particularly those in the New Zealand Company settlement of Wellington, were calling for local militia to be formed.Editorial, New Zealand Colonist and Port Nicholson Advisor, Vol 1 issue 104, 28 July 1843, p2 This prompted the Chief Police Magistrate Major Matthew Richmond to order its immediate disbandment. Richmond also dispatched 53 soldiers from the 96th Regiment from Auckland to Wellington.
These calls for a militia continued to grow with the Wairau Affray. The calls eventually lead to a Bill being introduced to the Legislative Assembly in 1844. On 22 March 1845 the Flagstaff War broke out, which proved to be the catalyst for passing the Bill.Bay of Islands, Daily Southern Cross, Vol 2 issue 101, 22 March 1845, p2
In 1844 a Select Committee of the House of Commons had recommended that a Militia, composed of both settlers and native Maori, and a permanent native force be set up.Mounted Police, 'New Zealander', Volume 2, Issue 59, 18 July 1846, Page 2
On 25 March 1845 the Militia Ordinance was passed into law.'Daily Southern Cross', 19 April 1845, Page 4, Government Gazette Notices. Major Richmond was appointed commander of the Wellington Battalion of the Militia. The Nelson Militia were formed about the end of May.
In June 1845, 75 members of the Auckland Militia under Lieutenant Figg became the first unit to support British Imperial troops in the Flagstaff War, serving as pioneers.[ref]Bay of Islands, 'New Zealander', Volume 1, Issue 2, 14 June 1845, Page 3
[/ref] Seven militia were wounded in action between 30 June and 1 July 1845. One, a man named Rily, later died of his wounds.Auckland, 'New Zealand Spectator and Cook's Strait Guardian', Volume II, Issue 51, 27 September 1845, Page 3 Disbandment of the Nelson and Wellington Militias followed much to the dismay of their supporters.Nelson Militia, 'Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle', Volume IV, Issue 187, 4 October 1845, Page 122
Trouble in the Hutt Valley, near Wellington, early March 1846 prompted the new Lieutenant Governor George Grey to proclaim Martial Law and call out the Hutt Militia.[ref]Editorial, 'New Zealand Spectator and Cook's Strait Guardian', Volume II, Issue 75, 14 March 1846, Page 2
[/ref] The paper further noted that Grey intended to maintain two companies of Militia in Wellington. As problems continued in the area at least 160 Militia remained.Port Nicholson, 'New Zealander', Volume 2, Issue 56, 27 June 1846, Page 3
On 28 October 1846, with the passing of the Armed Constabulary Ordinance in 1846, a fresh call was made by Mr Donnelly of the Legislature to do away with the Militia because of its expense... the formation of a well-organised Militia and of a force of Natives in the service of Her Majesty, would appear to be the measures most likely to be successfully adopted.Withdrawal of the troops, 'Daily Southern Cross', Volume VI, Issue 433, 22 August 1851, Page 2
1854 brought a new threat to the attention of the colony, because up to that time the military focus had been upon internal conflicts between settlers and the native population. War had broken out between Russia and Turkey. This war began to involve the major European powers and exposed New Zealand and Australia to a possible external threat from Russian naval forces. Our defences, 'Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle', Volume XIII, Issue 639, 3 June 1854, Page 5 Parliament discussed providing guns at ports around the country for use in the event of a war with a foreign power.Proceedings of the General Assembly, 'Taranaki Herald', Volume V, Issue 211, 16 August 1856, Page 2
By 1858 attention had swung back to local issues with a land dispute in New Plymouth prompting Governor Thomas Gore Brown to call out its Militia under Captain Charles Brown.[ref]Proclamation,
'Taranaki Herald', Volume VI, Issue 288, 6 February 1858, Page 3[/ref] A prelude to what was to become the First Taranaki War and a period of conflict in the North Island until 1872.
Parliament revised and expanded the Militia Ordinance, replacing it with the Militia Act 1858. The Act also outlined the purposes under which Militia could be called upon, including invasion. Debates in Parliament had included expressions of concern about Russian naval expansion in the northern Pacific, pointed out that the sole naval defence consisted of one 24 gun frigate, and the time it would take for Britain to come to the colony's aid.
British Imperial troops remained in New Zealand until February 1870, during the later stage of the New Zealand Wars, by which time settler units had replaced them.teara.nz/1966/B/BritishTroopsInNewZealand/BritishTroopsInNewZealand/en
The Defence Act 1886, reclassified the militia as Volunteers. These were the forerunners of the Territorials.

Volunteers (1858–1909)

Although there were informal volunteer units as early as 1845, the appropriate approval and regulation of the units did not occur until The Militia Act 1858. Those who signed up for these units were exempt from militia duty, but had to be prepared to serve anywhere in New Zealand. One of the earliest gazetted units (13 January 1859) was the Taranaki Volunteer Rifle Company.Taranaki Volunteer Rifle Corps, 'Taranaki Herald', Volume VII, Issue 340, 5 February 1859, Page 3
To the Volunteer Rifle Corps were added Volunteer Artillery Corps in mid-1859. The first of these Volunteer Artillery Corps were based in Auckland.[ref]Auckland,
Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle, Volume XVIII, Issue 71, 3 September 1859, Page 2[/ref]
By late 1859 the number of  Volunteer units were so great that Captain H C Balneavis was appointed Deputy Adjunct-General, based at Auckland.Untitled, Hawke's Bay Herald, Volume 2, Issue 103, 10 September 1859, Page 2

Colonial Defence Force (1862–1867)

In 1863 the Government passed the Colonial Defence Force Act 1862 creating the first Regular Force. This was to be a mounted body of not more than 500 troops, with both Maori and settlers, and costing no more than 30,000 pounds per annum.
Formation of the first unit did not commence until early April 1863, with 100 men being sought at New Plymouth under Captain Atkinson.(From our own correspondent), Daily Southern Cross, Volume XIX, Issue 1782, 6 April 1863, Page 6 Hawke's Bay was to have the next unit.Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle, Volume XXII, Issue 37, 25 April 1863, Page 2
Formation of an Auckland unit under Colonel Nixon commenced in July and by the 14th had 30 men.Military and volunteer movements, Daily Southern Cross, Volume XIX, Issue 1869, 14 July 1863, Page 3

By October 1863 there was no Wairarapa based Defence force, and 50 were based in Wanganui. The total Defence Force numbered 375 by 3 November 1863.House of Representatives - Tuesday, 3 November 1863, 'Daily Southern Cross', Volume XIX, Issue 1966, 4 November 1863, Page 4
In October 1864 the Government decided to reduce the numbers in the Colonial Defence Force to 75 with three units of 25 members each in Wellington, Hawkes Bay and Taranaki. There were calls, particularly from South Island papers, for the British Imperial troops to be replaced by local forces. colonial troops question, Southland Times, Volume I, Issue 74, 18 November 1864, Page 3 Parliamentary debates in late 1864 also supported this view, especially as the cost of maintaining the Imperial troops was becoming a greater financial burden on the colony.Parliament of New Zealand, Daily Southern Cross, Volume XX, Issue 2298, 1 December 1864, Page 5

=Defence review, March 1865=

At the request of the Governor in January 1865 a formal statement on the defence of the Colony was presented on 20 March 1865. This proposed an armed constabulary force supported by friendly natives, volunteer units, and militia as the case may require be established to take the place of the Imperial troops. They were to be divided into 30 companies of 50 men each based as follows:
The total Defence budget, which included purchasing a steamer for use on the Waikato, Patea, and Wanganui rivers, was 187,000 pounds per annum. The budget's focus was solely on internal conflict. The issue of external conflict did not begin to resurface until the following year, with thought being given again to coastal defences.Coastal defences, 'Colonist', Volume IX, Issue 916, 13 July 1866, Page 5
The Colonial Defence Force was disbanded in October 1867 by the Armed Constabulary Act 1867. Its members transferred to the Armed Constabulary.

Evolution of volunteers and militia

From 1863 to 1867 Forest Ranger volunteer units were formed, tasked with searching out Maori war parties, acting as scouts, and protecting lines of communication. They arose out of the need to prevent ambushes and random attacks on civilians near forest areas. These units used guerrilla style tactics, moving through areas under cover of darkness and ambushing war parties. The Forest Rangers were disbanded on 1 October 1867.New Zealand Gazette, Daily Southern Cross, Volume XXIII, Issue 3209, 29 October 1867, Page 4
Alongside the militia and the British Imperial forces were the Armed Constabulary. The Armed Constabulary were formed in 1846 with the passage of the Armed Constabulary Ordinance.co.htm retrieved 20 December 2010 The Constabulary's role was both regular law enforcement and during the New Zealand Wars militia support. From 1867 to 1886 the Armed Constabulary were the only permanent force in New Zealand. In 1886 the militia functions of the Armed Constabulary were transferred to the New Zealand Permanent Militia by the Defence Act 1886. Lieutenant Colonel John Roberts was the Permanent Militia's first commander from January 1887 to his retirement in 1888.teara.nz/en/biographies/1r12/1 retrieved 20 December 2010

Defence Act 1909

The Defence Act 1909 replaced the Volunteer forces with a Territorial force and compulsory military training, a regime that remained until the late 1960s, with breaks from 1918 to 1921, 1930 to 194?, and 194? to 1948.teara.nz/en/1966/defence-armed-services-army-new-zealand/5 retrieved 21 December 2010

Separate services (from 1909)

Independent New Zealand armed forces developed in the early twentieth century; the Royal New Zealand Navy was the last to emerge as an independent service in 1941.navymuseum.nz/history/time/ww2/1941-rnzn/default. New Zealand forces served alongside the British and other Empire and Commonwealth nations in World War I and World War II.
The fall of Singapore in 1942 showed that Britain could no longer protect its far-flung Dominions. Closer military ties were therefore necessary for New Zealand's defence. With United States entering the war, they were an obvious choice. Links with Australia had also been developed earlier; both nations sent troops to the Anglo-Boer War and New Zealand officer candidates had trained at Australia's Royal Military College, Duntroon since 1911, a practice that continues to this day. A combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) was formed for the Gallipoli Campaign during World War I, and its exploits are key events in the military history of both countries.
The NZDF came into existence under the Defence Act 1990. Under previous legislation, the three services were part of the Ministry of Defence. Post-1990, the Ministry of Defence is a separate, policy-making body under a Secretary of Defence, equal in status to the Chief of Defence Force.

Higher direction of the armed services

A new HQNZDF facility was opened by Prime Minister Helen Clark in March 2007.nzdf.nz/news/media-releases/20070328-eedhobpm. The Aitken St facility is home to around 900 employees of the NZDF, the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service and the New Zealand Ministry of Defence. HQNZDF operates as the administrative and support headquarters for the New Zealand Defence Force, with operational forces under the separate administrative command and control of HQJFNZ.

Joint Forces headquarters

The operational forces of the three services are directed from Headquarters Joint Forces New Zealand on the opposite side of a road from Trentham Military Camp in Upper Hutt. HQ JFNZ was established at Trentham on 1 July 2001. From this building, a former NZ government computer centre that used to house the Army's Land Command, the Air Component Commander, Maritime Component Commander, and Land Component Commander exercise command over their forces. Commander Joint Forces New Zealand (COMJFNZ), controls all overseas operational deployments and most overseas exercises.nzdf.nz/operations/hqjfnz/default.htm

Branches

Army

New Zealand's Army has around 4,500 full-time and 2,500 part-time troops, organised as light infantry and motorised infantry equipped with 105 Canadian-manufactured LAV III Light Armoured Vehicles (NZLAV). There are also armoured reconnaissance, artillery, logistic, communications, medical and intelligence elements. The New Zealand Special Air Service is the NZDF's special forces capability, which operates in both conventional warfare and counter-terrorist roles. The Corps and Regiments of the New Zealand Army include:

Navy

The Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) includes two Anzac class frigates, developed in conjunction with Australia, and based on the German MEKO 200 design. Eight other vessels are in use, consisting of patrol vessels and logistics vessels. In 2010, the RNZN completed the acquisition of seven new vessels: one large Multi-Role Vessel named the HMNZS Canterbury, two Offshore Patrol Vessels, and four Inshore Patrol Vessels. All of these vessels were acquired under Project Protector, and were built to commercial, not naval, standards.

Air Force

The Royal New Zealand Air Force consists of 50 aircraft, consisting of P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft and Lockheed C-130 Hercules and other transport aircraft. The RNZAF does not have an air combat force following the retirement without replacement of its A-4 Skyhawk and Aermacchi MB-339 squadrons. A plan to acquire 28 F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft was controversially cancelled by the Labour Government in 2000. The NH90 helicopter was ordered to replace Bell UH-1 Iroquois. The PAC CT/4 Airtrainer is locally produced.

Foreign defence relations

New Zealand states it maintains a "credible minimum force," although critics (including the New Zealand National Party while in opposition) maintain that the country's defence forces have fallen below this standard.national.nz/Article.
Acknowledging the need to improve its defence capabilities, the government in 2005 announced the Defence Sustainability Initiative allocating an additional NZ$4.6 billion over 10 years to modernise the country's defence equipment and infrastructure and increase its military personnel. The funding represented a 51% increase in defence spending since the Labour government took office in 1999.
New Zealand is an active participant in multilateral peacekeeping. It has taken a leading role in peace-keeping in the Solomon Islands and the neighbouring island of Bougainville. New Zealand maintains a contingent in the Multinational Force and Observers and has contributed to United Nations and other peacekeeping operations in Angola, Cambodia, Somalia, Lebanon and the former Yugoslavia. It also participated in the Multilateral Interception Force in the Persian Gulf. New Zealand has an ongoing  peacekeeping commitment to East Timor, where it participated in the INTERFET, UNTAET and UMAMET missions from 1999–2002, with an infantry battalion which was withdrawn in late 2002. In response to renewed conflict in 2006 more troops were deployed as part of an international force. New Zealand troops currently maintains an infantry company and supporting elements in East Timor. New Zealand has participated in 2 NATO-led coalitions; SFOR in the Former Yugoslavia (until December 2004) and an ongoing one in Afghanistan (which took over from a US-led coalition in 2006). New Zealand also participated in the European Union EUFOR operation in the former Yugoslavia from December 2004 until New Zealand ended its 15-year continuous contribution there on 30 June 2007.
New Zealand shares training facilities, personnel exchanges, and joint exercises with the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Brunei, Tonga, and South Pacific states. It exercises with its Five Power Defence Arrangements partners, Australia, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, and Singapore. New Zealand military personnel participate in training exercises, conferences and visits as part of military diplomacy.
New Zealand is a signatory of the ANZUS treaty, a defence pact between New Zealand, Australia and the United States dating from 1951. After the 1986 anti-nuclear legislation that refused access of nuclear-powered or armed vessels to ports, the USA withdrew its obligations to New Zealand under ANZUS, and ANZUS exercises are now bilateral between Australia and the United States. Under anti-nuclear legislation, any ship must declare whether it is nuclear-propelled or carrying nuclear weapons before entering New Zealand waters. Due to the US policy at that time of "neither confirm nor deny", ship visits ceased although NZ and the USA remained "good friends". Despite the Presidential Directive of 27 September 1991 that removed tactical nuclear weapons from U.S. surface ships, attack submarines, and naval aircraft, N5GP Release of Information on Nuclear Weapons and on Nuclear Capabilities of U.S. Forces dated 3 February 06 ship visits have not resumed. Despite signs of rapprochement in recent years, military relationships with the US remain limited. The NZDF served alongside NATO-led forces in Afghanistan in the first decade of the twentyfirst century, and in 2004 the NZSAS was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation by US President George W Bush for "extraordinary heroism" in action. In 2008 US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during a visit to New Zealand said "New Zealand is now a friend and an ally".scoop.co.htm U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in Auckland, New Zealand (25–27 July 2008)
New Zealand is a member of the ABCA Armies standardisation programme, the naval AUSCANNZUKUS forum, the Air and Space Interoperability Council (ASIC, the former ASCC, which, among other tasks, allocates NATO reporting names) and other Western 'Five Eyes' fora for sharing signals intelligence information and achieving interoperability with like-minded armed forces, such as The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP).
