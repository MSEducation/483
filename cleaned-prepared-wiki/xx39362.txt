Stanley Augustus Holloway, OBE (1 October 1890 – 30 January 1982) was an English stage and film actor, comedian, singer, poet and monologist. He was famous for his comic and character roles on stage and screen, especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in My Fair Lady. He was also renowned for his comic monologues and songs which he performed and recorded throughout most of his 70-year career.
Born in London, Holloway pursued a career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage appearances before infantry service in the First World War, after which he had his first major theatre success starring in Kissing Time when the musical transferred to the West End from Broadway.  In 1921, he joined a concert party, The Co-Optimists, and his career began to flourish. At first, he was employed chiefly as a singer, but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised.  Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by Marriott Edgar, were absorbed into popular British culture, and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in variety, pantomime and musical comedy, including several revues.
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the British Film Institute and Pathé News and took character parts in a series of war films including Major Barbara, The Way Ahead, This Happy Breed and The Way to the Stars. After the war, he appeared in the film Brief Encounter and made a series of films for Ealing Studios, including Passport to Pimlico, The Lavender Hill Mob and The Titfield Thunderbolt.
In 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible Alfred P. Doolittle in My Fair Lady, a role that he played on Broadway, the West End and in the film version in 1964. The role brought him international fame, and his performances earned him nominations for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  In his later years, Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US, toured in revues, appeared in stage plays in Britain, Canada, Australia and the US, and continued to make films into his eighties. Holloway was married twice and had five children, including the actor Julian Holloway.

Career

=Early career and First World War=

Holloway's stage career began in 1910, when he travelled to Walton-on-the-Naze to audition for The White Coons Show, a concert party variety show arranged and produced by Will S. Pepper, father of Harry S. Pepper, with whom Holloway later starred in The Co-Optimists. 49 This seaside show lasted six weeks. 50
In 1913 Holloway was recruited by the comedian Leslie Henson to feature as a support in Henson's more prestigious concert party called Nicely, Thanks. In later life, Holloway often spoke of his admiration for Henson, citing him as a great influence on his career. The two became firm friends and often consulted each other before taking jobs. In his 1967 autobiography, Holloway dedicated a whole chapter to Henson,Holloway and Richards, p. 289 whom he described as "the greatest friend, inspiration and mentor a performer could have had". Later in 1913, Holloway decided to train as an operatic baritone, and so he went to Italy to take singing lessons from Ferdinando Guarino in Milan. However, a yearning to start a career in light entertainment and a contract to re-appear in Bert Graham and Will Bentley's concert party at the West Cliff Theatre caused him to return home after six months. 54–55
In the early months of 1914, Holloway made his first visit to the US and then went to Buenos Aires and Valparaíso with the concert party The Grotesques.co.Holloway and Richards, pp. 56–57  At the age of 25, Holloway enlisted in the Connaught Rangers. In December 1915London Gazette Supplement, 8 December 1915, pp. 12296 – 97 he was commissioned as a subaltern because of his previous training as a private in the London Rifle Brigade. He was stationed in Cork and initially fought against Sinn Féin during the Easter Rising of 1916. 58–59 Later that year, he was sent to France,Holloway and Richards, p. 59 where he fought in the trenches alongside Michael O'Leary, who later won the Victoria Cross for gallantry. 60  Holloway and O'Leary stayed in touch after the war, becoming close friends.
Holloway spent much of his time in the later part of the war organising shows to boost troop morale in France. 60 and 76  One such revue, Wear That Ribbon, was performed in honour of O'Leary's winning the VC.  Holloway, along with Henson and his newly established Star Attractions concert party, entertained the British troops in Wimereux. 19  The party included such performers as Jack Buchanan, Eric Blore, Binnie Hale and Phyllis Dare, as well as the performers who would later form The Co-Optimists. 20  Upon his return from France, Holloway joined a Yorkshire regiment in HartlepoolHolloway and Richards, p. 76 and immediately after the war ended he starred in The Disorderly Room with Leslie Henson, which Eric Blore had written while serving in the South Wales Borderers.  It toured theatres on England's south coast, including Walton-on-the-Naze and Clacton-on-Sea.

=Inter-war years=

On being demobilised on 1 May 1919, Holloway returned to London and resumed his singing and acting career, finding success in two West End musicals at the Winter Garden Theatre.  Later that month, he created the role of Captain Wentworth in Guy Bolton and P. G. Wodehouse's Kissing Time,Findon, B. H., "Kissing Time", The Play Pictorial, May 1919, p. 82; "Theatres", The Times, 3 July 1920, p. 14 followed in 1920 by the role of René in A Night Out."A Night Out", The Play Pictorial, September 1920, p. 71  Following its provincial success, The Disorderly Room was given a West End production at the Victoria Palace Theatre in late 1919, in which Holloway starred alongside Henson and Tom Walls. 61 Holloway made his film debut in a 1921 silent comedy called The Rotters."Holloway, Stanley Augustus (1890–1982)", Oxford Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Oxford University Press, 2006, online edition, accessed 5 December 2011 
From June 1921, Holloway had considerable success in The Co-Optimists, a concert party formed with performers whom he had met during the war in France, which The Times called "an all-star 'pierrot' entertainment in the West-end.""The Theatres", The Times, 20 June 1921, p. 9 It opened at the small Royalty TheatreHolloway and Richards, p. 28 and soon transferred to the much larger Palace Theatre, where the initial version of the show ran for over a year, giving more than 500 performances."The Palace Itself Again – Co-Optimists' Cheery Burlesque", The Times, 23 August 1921, p. 6Holloway and Richards, p. 29  The entertainment was completely rewritten at regular intervals to keep it fresh, and the final edition, beginning in November 1926, was the 13th version."The Co-Optimists", The Times, 30 November 1926, p. 12 The Co-Optimists closed in 1927 at His Majesty's Theatre after 1,568 performances over eight years. In 1929, a feature film version was made, with Holloway rejoining his former co-stars."The Film World", The Times, 18 December 1929, p. 12
In 1923 Holloway established himself as a BBC Radio performer. The early BBC broadcasts brought variety and classical artists together, and Holloway could be heard in the same programme as the cellist John Barbirolli or the Band of the Scots Guards."Programmes for the Week-End", The Times, 16 January 1926, p. 4 He developed his solo act throughout the 1920s while continuing his involvement with the musical theatre and The Co-Optimists. In 1924 he made his first gramophone discs, recording for HMV two songs from The Co-Optimists: "London Town" and "Memory Street"."Hit the Deck", The Times, 4 November 1927, p. 7 In The Manchester Guardian, Ivor Brown praised him for a singing style "which coaxes the ear rather than clubbing the head."Brown, Ivor. "Hit the Deck", The Manchester Guardian, 4 November 1927, p. 15
Holloway began regularly performing monologues, both on stage and on record, in 1928, with his own creation, Sam Small, in Sam, Sam, Pick oop thy Musket. Over the following years, he recorded more than 20 monologues based around the character, most of which he wrote himself. He created Sam Small after Henson had returned from a tour of northern England and told him a story about an insubordinate old soldier from the Battle of Waterloo. 83 Holloway developed the character, naming him after a Cockney friend of Henson called Annie Small;Holloway and Richards, p. 85 the name Sam was chosen at random. Holloway adopted a northern accent for the character. The Times commented, "For absolute delight ... there is nothing to compare with Mr. Stanley Holloway's monologue, concerning a military contretemps on the eve of Waterloo ... perfect, even to the curled moustache and the Lancashire accent of the stubborn Guardsman hero.""Variety Theatres", The Times, 12 February 1929, p. 7
In 1929 Holloway played another leading role in musical comedy, Lieutenant Richard Manners in Song of the Sea, and later that year he performed in the revue Coo-ee, with Billy Bennett, Dorothy Dickson and Claude Hulbert. When The Co-Optimists re-formed in 1930, he rejoined that company, now at the Savoy Theatre, and at the same venue appeared in Savoy Follies in 1931,Gaye, p. 746 where he introduced to London audiences the monologue The Lion and Albert."Savoy Follies – Sparkle and Spontaneity", The Times, 8 July 1932, p. 12 The monologue was written by Marriott Edgar, who based the story on a news item about a boy who was eaten by a lion in the zoo. "Stanley Holloway: Old Sam and Young Albert Original 1930–1940 Recordings", "About this Album", ClassicsOnline, accessed 5 December 2011  In the monologue, Mr. and Mrs. Ramsbottom react in a measured way when their son Albert is swallowed. Neither Edgar nor Holloway was convinced that the piece would succeed, but needing material for an appearance at a Northern Rugby League dinner Holloway decided to perform it. 91 It was well received, and Holloway introduced it into his stage act. Subsequently, Edgar wrote 16 monologues for him. In its obituary of Holloway, The Times wrote that Sam and Albert "became part of English folklore during the 1930s, and they remained so during the Second World War."  These monologues employed the Holloway style that has been called "the understated look-on-the-bright-side world of the cockney working class. ... Holloway's characters are like Albert, or obstinate, and hilariously clueless.  He often told his stories in costume; sporting outrageous attire and bushy moustaches."
Beginning in 1934, Holloway appeared in a series of British films, three of which featured his creation Sam Small. He started his association with the filmmakers Ealing Studios in 1934, appearing in the fifth Gracie Fields picture Sing As We Go."Sing as We Go", British Film Institute, accessed 23 April 2011 His other films from the 1930s included Squibs (1935)"Squibs", British Film Institute, accessed 23 April 2011 and The Vicar of Bray (1937)."The Vicar of Bray", British Film Institute, accessed 23 April 2011 In December 1934, Holloway made his first appearance in pantomime, playing Abanazar in Aladdin. In his first season in the part, he was overshadowed by his co-star, Sir Henry Lytton, as the Emperor,"Stanley Holloway in Pantomime", The Manchester Guardian, 1 January 1935, p. 10 but he quickly became established as a favourite in his role, playing it in successive years in Leeds, London, Edinburgh and Manchester.

=Second World War and post-war=

On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Holloway was 49, too old for active service.  Instead, he made his contribution in short propaganda pieces for the British Film Institute and Pathé News. He narrated documentaries aimed at lifting morale in war-torn Britain, including Albert's Savings (1940), written by Marriott Edgar and featuring the character Albert Ramsbottom,"Stanley Holloway in War Savings Film", Tamworth Herald, 10 August 1940, p. 5"Britain's Home Front at War: Words for Battle", Imperial War Museum, accessed 22 April 2011; and "Britain's Home Front at War: Words for Battle", Play.8 (1943), with a script written by E. C. Bentley about a worker who neglects to have an injury examined and contracts blood poisoning. Both films were included on a 2007 Imperial War Museum DVD Britain's Home Front at War: Words for Battle.
On stage during the war years, Holloway appeared in revues, first Up and Doing, with Henson, Binnie Hale and Cyril Ritchard in 1940 and 1941,"Theatres", The Observer, 26 May 1940, p. 1 and then Fine and Dandy, with Henson, Dorothy Dickson, Douglas Byng and Graham Payn."Theatres", The Observer, 23 August 1942, p. 1 In both shows, Holloway presented new monologues, and The Times thought a highlight of Fine and Dandy was a parody of the BBC radio programme The Brains Trust, with Holloway "ponderously anecdotal" and Henson "gigglingly omniscient"."Savile Theatre", The Times, 1 May 1942, p. 6
In 1941 Holloway took a character part in Gabriel Pascal's film of Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara, in which he played a policeman. He had leading parts in later films, including The Way Ahead (1944), This Happy Breed (1944) and The Way to the Stars (1945)."Holloway, Stanley", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 21 April 2011   Holloway also starred in a series of films for Ealing Studios, beginning with Champagne Charlie in 1944 alongside Tommy Trinder. After that he made Nicholas Nickleby (1947) and Another Shore (1948).  He next appeared in three of the most famous Ealing Comedies, Passport to Pimlico (1949), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). His final film with the studio was Meet Mr. Lucifer (1953).
In 1948 Holloway toured for six months in Australia around Melbourne and in New Zealand"Stanley Holloway for Adelaide", The Mail, 30 April 1949, p. 10, accessed 24 September 2011 supported by the band leader Billy Mayerl."Stanley Holloway coming here", The Advertiser, 1 April 1949, p. 4, accessed 24 September 2011"English Comedian to Broadcast", The Argus, 14 April 1949, p. 5, accessed 23 September 2011 He made his Australian début at The Tivoli Theatre, Melbourne,"Stanley Holloway's Melbourne début", The Argus, 6 July 1949, p. 9, accessed 24 September 2011 and recorded television appearances to publicise the forthcoming release of Passport to Pimlico."Stanley Holloway Goes Home", The Argus, 5 August 1949, p. 5, accessed 24 September 2011  Holloway wrote the monologue Albert Down Under especially for the tour."Stanley Holloway Reaches Melbourne", Advocate, 19 April 1949, p. 4, accessed 24 September 2011

=1950s and 1960s stage and screen=

In 1954 Holloway joined the Old Vic theatre company to play Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream, with Robert Helpmann as Oberon and Moira Shearer as Titania. After playing at the Edinburgh Festival, the Royal Shakespeare Company took the production to New York, where it played at the Metropolitan Opera House and then on tour of the US and Canada. The production was harshly reviewed by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, but Holloway made a strong impression.  Holloway said of the experience: "Out of the blue I was asked by the Royal Shakespeare Company to tour America with them, playing Bottom. ... From that American tour came the part of Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady and from then on, well, just let's say I was able to pick and choose my parts and that was very pleasant at my age."The New York Times; Obituary 31 January 1982, p. 36  Holloway's film career continued simultaneously with his stage work; one example was the 1956 comedy Jumping for Joy.  American audiences became familiar with his earlier film roles when the films began to be broadcast on television in the 1950s.
In 1956 Holloway created the role of Alfred P. Doolittle in the original  Broadway production of My Fair Lady. The librettist, Alan Jay Lerner, remembered in his memoirs that Holloway was his first choice for the role, even before it was written. Lerner's only concern was whether, after so long away from the musical stage, Holloway still had his resonant singing voice. Holloway reassured him over a lunch at Claridge's: Lerner recalled, "He put down his knife and fork, threw back his head and unleashed a strong baritone note that resounded through the dining room, drowned out the string quartet and sent a few dozen people off to the osteopath to have their necks untwisted."Lerner, pp. 62–63 Holloway had a long association with the show, appearing in the original 1956 Broadway production at the Mark Hellinger Theatre, the 1958 London version at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and the film version in 1964 which he undertook instead of the role of Admiral Bloom in Mary Poppins which he had been offered the same year. 121  In The Manchester Guardian, Alistair Cooke wrote, "Stanley Holloway distils into the body of Doolittle the taste and smell of every pub in England."Cooke, Alistair. "Shavian Source of a Delicious Daydream", The Manchester Guardian, 20 March 1956, p. 5
Looking back in 2004, Holloway's biographer Eric Midwinter wrote, "With his cockney authenticity, his splendid baritone voice, and his wealth of comedy experience, he made a great success of this role, and, as he said, it put him 'bang on top of the heap, in demand' again at a time when, in his mid-sixties, his career was beginning to wane". 12 His performances earned him a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Following his success on Broadway, Holloway played Pooh-Bah in a 1960 US television Bell Telephone Hour production of The Mikado, produced by the veteran Gilbert and Sullivan performer Martyn Green. Holloway appeared with Groucho Marx and Helen Traubel of the Metropolitan Opera. Mikado – Bell Telephone Hour, The Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, accessed 11 April 2011  His notable films around this time included Alive and Kicking in 1959, co-starring Sybil Thorndike and Kathleen Harrison,"Cinemas", The Observer, 14 June 1959, p. 25 and No Love for Johnnie in 1961 opposite Peter Finch."Weaknesses of plot mar 'No Love for Johnnie'", The Guardian, 24 April 1961, p. 19 In 1962, Holloway took part in a studio recording of Oliver! with Alma Cogan and Violet Carson, in which he played Fagin.Oliver! studio cast recording, 1962 LP, Capitol, accessed 14 September 2011
In 1962 Holloway played the role of an English butler called Higgins in a US television sitcom called Our Man Higgins. It ran for only a season. His son Julian also appeared in the series. 10 In 1964 he again appeared on stage in Philadelphia in Cool Off!, a short-lived Faustian spoof. "Obscure Recordings: Cool Off!" Broadway. He also appeared in the 1965 war film In Harm's Way, together with John Wayne and Kirk Douglas. "In Harm's Way", The New York Times, 7 April 1965

=Last years=

Holloway appeared for the first time in a major British television series in the BBC's 1967 adaptation of P. G. Wodehouse's Blandings Castle stories, playing Beach, the butler, to Ralph Richardson's Lord Emsworth. His portrayal of Beach was received with critical reservation, but the series was a popular success. After My Fair Lady, Holloway was able to get film roles in Mrs. Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter (1968), which starred the 1960s British pop group Herman's Hermits,Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter, British Film Institute, accessed 5 March 2012 The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, Flight of the Doves and Up the Front, all in the early 1970s.  His final film was Journey into Fear'' (1976)."Holloway, Stanley", British Film Institute, accessed 24 November 2011
In 1970, Holloway began an association with the Shaw Festival in Canada, playing Burgess in Candida.  He made what he considered his West End debut as a straight actor in Siege by David Ambrose at the Cambridge Theatre in 1972, co-starring with Alastair Sim and Michael Bryant. He returned to Shaw and Canada, playing the central character Walter/William in You Never Can Tell in 1973. His final film appearance was in 1975 in Daniel Mann's Journey into Fear with Zero Mostel, Joseph Wiseman and Shelley Winters. 720
Holloway continued to perform until well into his eighties, touring Asia and Australia in 1977 together with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and David Langton in The Pleasure of His Company, by Samuel A. Taylor and Cornelia Otis Skinner. He made his last appearance performing at the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium in 1980, aged 89.Cast: Royal Variety Performance 1980, British Film Institute, accessed 23 April 2011

Personal life

Holloway was married twice, first to Alice "Queenie" Foran. They met in June 1913 in Clacton, while he was performing in a concert party and she was selling charity flags on behalf of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. 66 Queenie was orphaned at the age of 16, something that Holloway felt he and Queenie had in common, as his mother had died that year and his father had earlier abandoned the family. He married Queenie in November 1913.
They had four children: Joan, born on Holloway's 24th birthday in 1914, Patricia (b. 1920), John (b. 1925) and Mary (b. 1928). 69–70 Upon the death of her mother, Queenie inherited some property in Southampton Row and relied on the rents from the property for her income. 71  During the First World War, while Holloway was away fighting in France, Queenie began to have financial trouble, as the tenants failed to pay their rent. Out of desperation, she approached several loan sharks, incurring a huge debt about which Holloway knew nothing.  She also started to drink heavily as the pressures from the war and of supporting her daughter took their toll. On Holloway's return from the war, the debt was paid off and they moved to Hampstead, West London. 9 By the late 1920s, Holloway found himself in financial difficulties with the British tax authorities and was briefly declared bankrupt."An Actor's Affairs", The Times, 4 December 1931, p. 4"Stanley Holloway's Affairs", Nottingham Evening Post, 3 December 1931, p. 9 In the 1930s, Holloway and Queenie moved to Bayswater"Tragedy of Stanley Holloway's Wife", Evening Telegraph, 25 November 1937, p. 5 and remained there until Queenie's death in 1937 at the age of 45, from cirrhosis of the liver. 68Holloway and Richards, pp. 71–72 Of the children from this first marriage, John worked as an engineer in an electrics company, and Mary worked for British Petroleum for many years. 70
On 2 January 1939, Holloway married a 25-year-old actress and former chorus dancer named Violet Marion Lane (1913–1997)Holloway and Richards, pp. 170–71General Register Office, England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes vol. 8d, p. 182 and they moved to Marylebone. 104  Violet was born into a working-class family from Leeds. Her mother was Scottish, and her civil engineer father, Alfred Lane, was a Yorkshireman.  The marriage lasted over 40 years until Holloway's death in 1982. Although he was a client of the Aza Agency in London, Violet effectively managed Holloway's career, and no project was taken on without her approval. In his autobiography, Holloway said of her, "I suppose I am committing lawful bigamy. Not only is she my wife, lover, mother, cook, chauffeuse, private secretary, house keeper, hostess, electrician, business manager, critic, handy woman, she is also my best friend."Holloway and Richards, p. 65 Together, they had one son, Julian, who also became an actor and is best known for appearing in the Carry On films.  Julian had a brief relationship with Patricia Neal's daughter Tessa Dahl which produced a daughter, the model and author Sophie Dahl. "The Delicious Miss Dahl and Edward VII", The Guardian, 24 March 2010  Julian was later briefly married to the actress Zena Walker."Zena Walker" Obituary, The Telegraph'', 8 September 2003
Holloway, Violet and Julian lived mainly in the tiny village of Penn, Buckinghamshire. 322 Holloway also owned other properties including a flat in St. John's Wood in North West London,Holloway's Flat in St. John's Wood (1933). Hulton Archive, GettyImages.co. 172 and a flat in Manhattan during the My Fair Lady Broadway years. The final years of his life were spent in Angmering, West Sussex, with Violet. Holloway had many friends in show business and forged close friendships with people such as Leslie Henson, Gracie Fields, Maurice Chevalier, Laurence OlivierHolloway and Richards, p. 227 and Arthur Askey, who said of him, "He was the nicest man I ever knew. He never had a wrong word to say about anyone. He was a great actor, a super mimic and a one-man walking comic show.""Stanley Holloway dies, 91", The Sunday Express, 31 January 1982 While working in the US, Holloway numbered among his friends Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Burgess Meredith and Groucho Marx. 333

Recordings

Holloway had a 54-year recording career, beginning in the age of acoustic recording, and ending in the era of the stereophonic LP. He mainly recorded songs from musicals and revues, and he recited many monologues on various subjects.  Most prominent among his recordings (aside from his participation in recordings of My Fair Lady) are those of three series of monologues that he made at intervals throughout his career. They featured Sam Small, Albert Ramsbottom, and historical events such as the Battle of Hastings, Magna Carta and the Battle of Trafalgar. In all, his discography runs to 130 recordings, spanning the period 1924 to 1978.org, accessed 14 September 2011  A review in The Gramophone of one of his 1957 albums containing recordings of his old "concert party" songs commented, "what a fine voice he has and how well he can use it – diction, phrasing, range and the interpretative insight of the artist"."Stanley Holloway. Concert Party", The Gramophone, October 1961, p. 72
