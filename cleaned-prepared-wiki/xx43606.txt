[[Glam metal]]

CATEGORIES: Glam metal, Hard rock, Heavy metal fashion, Heavy metal subgenres

Glam metal (also known as hair metal"Hair metal", AllMusic. Retrieved 6 July 2010. and often used synonymously with pop metal|class=explore |id=style/d7728 |pure_url=yes}} "Pop metal", AllMusic. Retrieved 6 July 2010.) is a subgenre of hard rock and heavy metal. It combines elements of these genres with punk rock and pop music, adding catchy hooks and guitar riffs, while borrowing from the aesthetic of 1970s glam rock.
It arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, particularly on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene, pioneered by bands such as Kix, Hanoi Rocks, Mötley Crüe and Quiet Riot. It was popular throughout the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, bringing to prominence bands including Poison, Cinderella and Bon Jovi.
The genre rapidly lost mainstream interest from 1992 to 1994 with the rise of grunge and the release of albums such as Nirvana's Nevermind, but it has enjoyed something of a revival since the beginning of the new millennium with reunions of many popular acts from the genre`s 1980s heyday, as well as the retro styling of new bands including The Darkness and Steel Panther.

Characteristics

Musically, glam metal uses traditional hard rock and heavy metal songs, incorporating elements of punk rock, while adding pop-influenced catchy hooks and guitar riffs.C. Smith, 101 Albums that Changed Popular Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), ISBN 0-19-537371-5, pp. 160–2. Like other heavy metal songs of the 1980s, they often feature shred guitar solos.D. Bukszpan, The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal (London: Barnes & Noble Publishing, 2003), ISBN 0-7607-4218-9, p. 63. They also include extensive use of harmonies, particularly in the characteristic power ballads, slow, emotional songs that gradually build to a strong finale.G. T. Pillsbury, Damage Incorporated: Metallica and the Production of Musical Identity (New York, NY: CRC Press, 2006), ISBN 0-415-97374-0, p. 45. These were among the most commercially successful singles in the genre and opened it up to a wider audience that would not have been attracted to traditional heavy metal. Lyrical themes often deal with love and lust, concerns inherited from blues music, with songs often directed at a particular woman.
Aesthetically glam metal draws heavily on the glam rock or glitter rock of the 1970s,P. Auslander, Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2006), ISBN 0-7546-4057-4, p. 232. often with very long backcombed hair, use of make-up, gaudy clothing and accessories (chiefly consisting of tight denim or leather jeans, spandex, and headbands).D. Bukszpan, The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal (London: Barnes & Noble Publishing, 2003), ISBN 0-7607-4218-9, p. 60. The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV, whose establishment coincided with the rise of the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of late-night parties, which were widely covered in the tabloid press.R. Batchelor and S. Stoddart, The 1980s (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007), ISBN 0-313-33000-X, p. 121.

Terminology

Sociologist Deena Weinstein points to the large number of terms used to describe more commercial forms of heavy metal, which she groups together as lite metal. These include, beside glam metal: melodic metal, false metal, poodle bands, nerf metal, pop metal or metal pop, the last of which was coined by critic Philip Bashe in 1983 to describe bands such as Van Halen and Def Leppard.D. Weinstein, Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Culture (Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2000), ISBN 0-306-80970-2, pp. 45–7. Allmusic distinguishes pop metal, which refers to the whole pop-tinted hard rock and heavy metal scene of the 1980s (including Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Europe), from hair metal, the characteristics of which are flashy clothing and heavy makeup (as embodied by Poison, and Mötley Crüe). Use of the derogatory term hair metal started in the early 1990s, as grunge gained popularity at the expense of 1980s metal. In the "definitive metal family tree" of his documentary Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, anthropologist Sam Dunn differentiates pop metal, which includes bands like Def Leppard, Europe, and Whitesnake, from glam metal bands that include Mötley Crüe, Twisted Sister and Poison.

History

Origins

Music journalist Stephen Davis claims the influences of the style can be traced back to acts like Aerosmith, Kiss, Boston, Cheap Trick, and The New York Dolls.S. Davis, Watch You Bleed: The Saga of Guns N' Roses (New York, NY: Gotham Books, 2008), ISBN 978-1-59240-377-6, p. 30. Kiss and to a less extent Alice Cooper, were major influences on the genre.I. Ellis, Soft Skull Press, (Soft Skull Press, 2008), ISBN 1593762062  Finnish band Hanoi Rocks have been credited with setting a blueprint for the look of hair metal.B. Macdonald, J. Harrington and R. Dimery, Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (London: Quintet, 2006), ISBN 0-7893-1371-5, p. 508.
Van Halen has been seen as highly influential on the movement, emerging in 1978 from the Los Angeles music scene on Sunset Strip, with a sound based around the lead guitar skills of Eddie Van Halen. He popularized a playing technique of two‐handed hammer‐ons and pull‐offs called tapping, showcased on the song "Eruption" from the album Van Halen. This sound, and lead singer David Lee Roth's stage antics, would be highly influential on glam metal, although Van Halen would never fully adopt a glam aesthetic.
Def Leppard, often categorized with the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, released their second album High 'n' Dry in 1981, mixing glam-rock with heavy metal, and helping to define the sound of hard rock for the decade.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0-87930-653-X, pp. 293–4. Their follow-up album Pyromania (1983), certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (over 10 million copies sold in the US), reached number two on the Billboard 200.  The singles "Foolin'", "Photograph", and "Rock of Ages", helped by the emergence of MTV, reached the Top 40."American album certifications – Def Leppard – Pyromania". RIAA. Retrieved 17 November 2011. Retrieved 17 November 2011 Def Leppard's Pyromania style was widely emulated, particularly by the emerging Californian scene.

First wave (1980-84)

In the early 1980s a number of bands from across the US began to move towards what would become the glam metal sound. These included Kix from Western Maryland, who released their eponymous debut in 1981.J. Franck, "Kix", AllMusic. Retrieved 7 July 2010. From San Francisco Night Ranger's first album Dawn Patrol (1982), reached the top 40 in the US, but their breakthrough album was 1983's Midnight Madness, which included the top five single "Sister Christian".S. T. Erlewine, "Night Ranger", AllMusic. Retrieved 7 July 2010. From New York Twisted Sister, originally formed as a glam rock band in 1972, released their first album, Under the Blade in 1982.E. Rivadavia, |class=artist |id=p5719 |pure_url=yes}} "Twisted Sister", AllMusic. Retrieved 7 July 2010.
The most active scene was in the clubs on Sunset Strip, Los Angeles, including The Trip, the Whisky a Go Go, and Starwood. These began to avoid booking punk rock bands because of fears of violence, and were colonized by metal bands, usually on a "pay to play" basis, creating a vibrant scene for hard rock music.A. Chapman and L. Silber, Rock to Riches: Build Your Business the Rock & Roll Way (Capital Books, 2008), ISBN 1-933102-65-9, p. 151. One of the first groups to emerge from this scene were Mötley Crüe, with their albums Too Fast for Love (1981) and Shout at the Devil (1983). Quiet Riot's US debut Metal Health (1983) was the first glam metal album, and arguably the first heavy metal album, to reach number one in the Billboard music charts and helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent bands.E. Rivadavia, "Quiet Riot", AllMusic. Retrieved 7 July 2010.

Second wave (1985-91)

By the mid-1980s, glam metal had begun to be a major mainstream success. Los Angeles continued to foster the most important scene around the Sunset Strip, with groups like London, which had originally formed as a glam rock band in the 1970s, and had seen future members of Mötley Crüe, Cinderella and Guns N' Roses pass through its ranks, finally releasing their début album Non Stop Rock in 1985.D. Stone, "London", AllMusic. Retrieved 19 June 2010. Pennsylvania also produced successful bands, with Harrisburg's Poison and Philadelphia's Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums, respectively Look What the Cat Dragged In and Night Songs in 1986.B.

Prato, "Stryper", AllMusic. Retrieved 19 June 2010. Van Halen released 5150 (1986), their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number one in the U.S. for three weeks and sold over six million copies. The anthemic The Final Countdown (1986) by Swedish group Europe reached the top ten in several countries, including the U.S. and while the title single reached number one in 26 countries.
The most commercially significant release of the era was by Bon Jovi from New Jersey, with Slippery When Wet (1986), which mixed hard rock with a pop sensitivity, and spent a total of eight weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 album chart, selling over 12 million copies in the US. It became the first hard rock album to spawn three top ten singles, two of which reached number one.L. Flick, "Bon Jovi bounce back from tragedy", Billboard, 28 September 2002, vol. 114, No. 39, ISSN 0006-2510, p. 81. The album has been credited with widening the audience for the genre, particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience, and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade.D. Nicholls, The Cambridge History of American Music (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), ISBN 0-521-45429-8, p. 378. During the mid-to-late 1980s, glam metal bands were in heavy rotation on the channel, often at the top of MTV's daily dial countdown, and some of the bands appeared on the channel's shows such as Headbanger's Ball, which became one of the most popular programs with over 1.3 million views a week.R.

Decline (1992-96)

The 1988 film The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years captured the Los Angeles scene of successful and aspiring bands. It also highlighted the excesses of glam metal, particularly the scene in which W.A.S.P. guitarist Chris Holmes was interviewed while drinking vodka on an inflatable raft in a swimming pool as his mother watched. As a result it has been seen as helping to create a backlash against the genre.E. Danville and C. Mott, The Official Heavy Metal Book of Lists (Fayetteville, AR: University of Arkansas Press, 2009), ISBN 0-87930-983-0, p. 16.M. G. Hurd, Women Directors and their Films (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007), ISBN 0-275-98578-4, p. 79. In the early 1990s glam metal's popularity rapidly declined after nearly a decade of success. Several music writers and musicians began to deride glam metal acts as "hair farmers," hinting at the soon-to-be-popularized term "hair metal." Another reason for the decline in popularity of the style may have been the declining  popularity of the power ballad. While its use, especially after a hard-rocking anthem, was initially a successful formula, in the late 1980s and early 1990s audiences lost interest in this approach.C. Aaron, "Don't fight the power", Spin, vol. 17, No. 11, Nov 2001, ISSN 0886-3032, p. 90.
One significant factor in the decline was the rise of grunge music from Seattle, with bands including Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. This was particularly obvious after the success of Nirvana's Nevermind (1991), which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a dirty sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion, fuzz and feedback, along with darker lyrical themes, a stripped-down aesthetic and a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style and performance.|class=explore |id=style/d2679 |pure_url=yes}} "Grunge", AllMusic. Retrieved 18 June 2010. Many major labels felt they had been caught off-guard by the surprise success of grunge and began turning over their personnel in favor of younger staffers more versed in the new scene. As MTV shifted its attention to the new style, glam metal bands found themselves relegated increasingly to late night airplay, and Headbanger's Ball was cancelled at the end of 1994, while KNAC went over to Spanish programming. Given glam metal's lack of a major format presence on radio, bands were left without a clear way to reach their audience. Other alternative rock bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jane's Addiction also helped supplant the popularity of the genre.R. Moore, Sells Like Teen Spirit: Music, Youth Culture, and Social Crisis (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2009), ISBN 0-8147-5748-0, p. 117.
Some artists tried to alter their sound, while others struggled on with their original format. In 1995 Van Halen released Balance, a multi-platinum seller that would be the band's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996 David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement, former Extreme singer Gary Cherone, was fired soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III. Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004. Warrant released Ultraphobic in 1995, an album with much more of an alternative/grunge approach. It had little commercial success. Guns N' Roses' original lineup was whittled away throughout the decade. Drummer Steven Adler was fired in 1990, guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band. Tensions between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 covers album The Spaghetti Incident?. Guitarist Slash left in 1996, followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1998. Axl Rose, the only original member, worked with a constantly changing lineup in recording an album that would take over ten years to complete.

Revival (1997-present)

During the late 1990s and the 2000s glam metal began to enjoy something of a revival. Some established acts who had managed to weather the storm enjoyed renewed popularity, others reformed and new bands emerged to emulate the glam metal style. Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with "It's My Life" (2000). They branched into country music with a version of their 2005 song "Who Says You Can't Go Home", which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006 and the rock/country album Lost Highway which reached number one in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi released The Circle, which marked a return to their hard rock sound and reached number one on the Billboard 200. Mötley Crüe reunited with Vince Neil to record the 1997 album Generation Swine and Poison reunited with guitarist C.C. DeVille in 1999, producing the mostly live Power to the People (2000); both bands began to tour extensively. There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007).S. T. Erlewine and G. Prato,"Van Halen", AllMusic. Retrieved 20 June 2010. The long awaited Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008, but only went platinum in the U.S., produced no hit singles, and failed to come close to the success of the band's late 1980s and early 1990s material.

The VH1 sponsored Rock Never Stops Tour, beginning in 1998, has seen many glam metal bands take to the stage again, including on the inaugural tour: Warrant, Slaughter, Quiet Riot, FireHouse, and L.A.
