Governors

Initially after the American Revolution, parts of the area now known as Ohio were claimed by New York, Virginia, and Connecticut; however, New York ceded its claim in 1782, Virginia in 1784, and Connecticut in 1786, though it maintained its Western Reserve in the area until 1800.

Governors of Northwest Territory

Throughout its 15-year history, Northwest Territory had only one governor, Arthur St. Clair. He was removed from office by President Thomas Jefferson November 22, 1802, and no successor was named, with Charles Willing Byrd, Secretary of the Territory, becoming Acting Governor, serving until Tiffin was inaugurated March 3, 1803.  There was no Ohio Territory; Ohio is considered the successor state to the Northwest Territory.

Governors of the State of Ohio

Ohio was admitted to the Union on March 1, 1803. Since then, it has had 62 governors, six of whom served non-consecutive terms.
The first constitution of 1803 allowed governors to serve for two years, limited to six of any eight years, commencing on the first Monday in the December following an election. A 1957 amendment lengthened the term to four years and allowed governors to only succeed themselves once, having to wait four years after their second term in a row before being allowed to run again.
Should the office of governor become vacant due to death, resignation, or conviction of impeachment, the lieutenant governor assumes the title of governor. Should the office of lieutenant governor also become vacant, the president of the senate becomes the acting governor.Ohio Constitution article III, § 17 Prior to 1851, the speaker of the senate acted as governor for the term.
