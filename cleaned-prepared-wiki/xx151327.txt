Early years

The teams origins date back to 1994, when Colombian coach Jorge Eliécer Paredes brought together a group of boys in the neighborhood of Villa Universitaria, Humacao to practice the sport every Saturday. It wasn't until 20 April 1995 that the team officially registered in the FPF as Club de Fútbol Tornados de la Ciudad Gris, and that same year they started participating in federation sponsored youth tournaments and events. In 1996 Mexican coach Evaristo Pérez joined the team, along came the academy's first student, Jonathan Genero Grilli, a 10 year-old argentinian boy. In 1997 they created a senior squad and joined the now defunct Liga Mayor up until its end in 2007.
In 1999, thanks to a group of concerned parents and Rosa de Trujillo the wife of the then mayor of Humacao, that wanted to consolidate the youth system, the team in all its levels has played in the Jacinto Hernández Park since 2001.
