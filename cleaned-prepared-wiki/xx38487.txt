The term electroclash was coined by New York DJ and promoter Larry Tee to describe music that combined synthpop, techno, punk and performance art. The genre was in reaction to the rigid formulations of techno music, putting an emphasis on song writing, showmanship and a sense of humour, described by The Guardian as one of "the two most significant upheavals in recent dance music history"."The female techno takeover", The Guardian, May 24, 2008 The visual aesthetic of electroclash has been associated with the 1982 cult film Liquid Sky."The Great Electroclash Swindle".
