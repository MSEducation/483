[[Regional Council of Lombardy]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of Lombardy, Italian Regional Councils

The Regional Council of Lombardy (Consiglio Regionale della Lombardia) is the legislative assembly of Lombardy.
It was first elected in 1970, when the ordinary regions were instituted, on the basis of the Constitution of Italy of 1948.

Composition

The political system of the Regions of Italy was changed in 1995, when a semi-presidential system was introduced. If until that year the Council was elected under a pure proportional system and the President of Lombardy was chosen and dismissed by the Council, since 1995 the President and the Council are jointly elected by the people.
The Regional Council of Lombardy is composed of 80 members. 64 councillors are elected in provincial constituencies by proportional representation using the largest remainder method with a Droop quota and open lists, while 16 councillors (elected in bloc) come from a "regional list", including the President-elect. One seat is reserved for the candidate who comes second. If a coalition wins more than 40 seats with PR, as happened during the 2000 election, only 8 candidates from the regional list will be chosen and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 72. If the winning coalition receives less than 50% of votes, as happened during the 1995 election, special seats are added to the Council to ensure a large majority for the President's coalition.Regional Council of Lombardy – Electoral lawRegional Council of Lombardy – Scheme for allocation of seatsMinistry of the Interior – Electoral Archive
The Council is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the simul stabunt, simul cadent prevision introduced in 1999 (literally they will stand together or they will fall together), also the Council is dissolved and a snap election is called.Regional Council of Lombardy – 1999 Constitutional LawRegional Council of Lombardy – Autonomy Statute
The Council choses its speaker, called President of the Council (Presidente del Consiglio).
The current Council fell on Friday October 26, 2012 with the resignation of 41 councillors.corriere.shtml Corriere della Sera, October 26, 2012.
