This is a list of the New Zealand national cricket team's test match victories. The New Zealand cricket team played its first Test in January 1930 against England in Christchurch, New Zealand. The team won their first Test 45 matches and 26 years later, against the West Indies at Eden Park, Auckland in the 1955/56 season. As of June 2013, NZ has played 384 Test matches, won 72, lost 158, and drawn 154.

1930 to 1944/45

The New Zealand cricket team's inaugural test match was played on 10â€“12 January 1930 against England in Christchurch. The team contained two of NZ's finest ever batsmen, Stewie Dempster and Roger Blunt but the match was lost.

1945/46 to 1954/55

In 1949 NZ sent one of its best ever sides to England. It contained Bert Sutcliffe, Martin Donnelly, John Reid and Jack Cowie. These 4 players consistently appear in NZ test "dream teams". However, 3-day test matches ensured that all 4 tests were drawn. Donnelly and Cowie retired after the 1949 tour. Despite playing 42 tests for NZ, Sutcliffe never played in a test victory. He missed the last two Tests of West Indies' tour in 1955-56, when New Zealand won one Test in Auckland, their maiden Test victory. Sutcliffe also missed the tour of South Africa in 1961-62, which New Zealand drew 2-2.

1955/56 to 1964/65

1 v West Indies at Auckland 1955/56 NZ won by 190 runs

The New Zealand cricket team achieved their first test win 45 matches and 26 years after playing their first test in 1930. Neither their form in the preceding season where they were bowled out for the world record low score of 26 by England, nor their form in the three matches prior to this one suggested NZ's first test victory was near at hand. The West Indies thrashed NZ in the first 3 matches of the 4 match series by an innings and 71 runs, an innings and 64 runs, and 9 wickets respectively.
In the end, the victory over the West Indies was as comprehensive as the 3 previous losses had been. NZ outplayed the West Indies from start to finish. John Reid, one of NZ's greatest cricketers, top scored for the match with 84 in the NZ first innings. Tony MacGibbon took 4 for 44 and Harry Cave 4 for 22 in the West Indies first innings of 145. The West Indies did even worse in their second bat, getting only 77, Cave again taking four wickets, 4 for 21.
As news of the tumbling West Indian wickets spread on the last afternoon of the match, Aucklanders began to flood into Eden Park to witness NZ's historic victory. When the last wicket fell the NZ fieldsman swooped on the stumps and around 7000 long-suffering supporters engulfed the ground.2.NZ Cricket Museum article on the first victory

2 v South Africa at Cape Town 1961/62 NZ won by 72 runs

John Reid had a magnificent tour of South Africa in 1961/62. He scored a record 1915 first class runs with 7 centuries. Under his captaincy NZ won the 3rd and 5th matches and drew the series 2 - 2 with the South Africans.
NZ batted first and ended up with a first innings lead of 195 thanks to Zin Harris's only test century, 68 from Noel McGregor, 92 from Reid, 69 from Murray Chapple and when the South Africans batted, 5 for 48 from Frank Cameron.
South Africa had NZ at 163 for 9 in their second innings but a 49 run unbroken partnership from keeper Artie Dick, (50* - his only test 50) and number 11, Cameron (10*) let Reid declare and set S.A. a target of 408. Jack Alabaster, the best leg spinner NZ has produced, took 4 for 119  to make sure the South Africans didn't get them.

3 v South Africa at Port Elizabeth 1961/62 NZ won by 40 runs

NZ were behind 2-1 in the series going into the fifth match. Again they batted first and got a healthy first innings lead (85), this time thanks to Paul Bartons only test century. All five NZ bowlers got wickets with Dick Motz having the best return, 3 for 33. In NZ's second innings Graham Dowling (78) and Reid (69) top scored and South Africa had to chase 314 to win.
Reid (45 overs 4 for 44) ripped out the middle of the South African line up and left them reeling at 193 for 7. The last 3 South Africans wickets put on 83 and gave their side a chance of a draw, but Cameron took the last wicket 21 minutes from the close of play on the final day to win the test and draw the series.
NZ did not win two tests in a series again until 1982/83 against an inexperienced Sri Lankan side in their first year of test cricket. They won both tests of a 2 match series.

1965/66 to 1974/75

4 v India at Christchurch 1967/68 NZ won by 6 wickets

The second test of 4. NZ batted first and Dowling scored 239 which was at the time the highest score for NZ. Bruce Murray got 74 and Keith Thomson 69 on his test debut. Thomson played only one more test. When India batted Motz took 6 for 63 and India failed by 14 runs to avoid the follow-on score. In India's 2nd innings Gary Bartlett took 6 for 38, his best bowling performance, and India were all out for 301. The target to win was only 88, but Bevan Congdon finished on 61 not out.
The Indians objected to Bartlett's bowling action but he was not called for throwing. India's opening bowler Abid Ali, was however when he deliberately threw one delivery in protest, in NZ's second innings. Bartlett, one of the fastest bowlers to come out of NZ, played in the last 2 tests of the series, but never played test cricket again and retired from first class cricket aged 30.7.
Jack Alabaster took the first two wickets in India's second innings. He was the only player to appear in all of New Zealand's first four Test victories.

5 v West Indies at Wellington 1968/69 NZ won by 6 wickets

NZ won the second test of a 3 match series after having lost the first. Motz took 6 for 69 to restrict the West Indies to 297 in the first innings. Glenn Turner in his second match scored 72 and Congdon 52 in NZ's 282 to ensure NZ stayed in touch. The West Indies collapsed in their second innings, scoring only 148 with Bob Cunis taking 3 for 35 and Bryan Yuile 3 for 26. NZ had little difficulty making 166 to win the match. Brian Hastings got 62*. The third test was drawn and so was the series.

6 v India at Nagpur 1969/70 NZ won by 167 runs

NZ went on a six test tour of India and Pakistan, playing 3 matches against each. The Indian series was drawn 1-1. NZ won the series against the Pakistanis 1-0. This was their first ever test series win. The tour was hard going for the NZers. They stayed at the grounds and not in hotels, the tests in India were played during the monsoons and the players were paid a pittance. Therefore two test wins, one drawn series and their first series win must be considered a very good outcome.9. Much more than cricket - Interview with Glenn Turner
Although the pitch took spin from the morning of day one the top four gave NZ a good start to their first innings, Graham Dowling got 69, Mark Burgess 89 and NZ got past 200 with only 3 down. The eventually first innings total of 319 was not high but it was good enough to give NZ a first innings lead of 62. Spinner Hedley Howarth bowled well in the boiling heat and took 4-66. Part-time spinner, Burgess also picked up 3 wickets.
NZ struggled against the spin in the second innings and at 171 for 9 India were still in the game, but Dayle Hadlee and Howarth added 43 for the last wicket and India had to chase 277. Spinners, Howarth (5-34)and Vic Pollard (3-21) bowled splendidly and India were bundled out for 109.
NZ were well on top in the third test (NZ 181 & 175-8 dec. and India 89 & 76-7), but rain and a deliberate go-slow by match officials in getting the ground ready to resume play thwarted NZ's efforts to take the series. At one stage the NZ team were on the field helping what few workers there were to remove the water on the covers.

7 v Pakistan at Lahore 1969/70 NZ won by 5 wickets

Pakistan never recovered from a collapse on the opening morning and lost to NZ for the first time. On a pitch that offering only a little turn the NZ spinners Hedley Howarth (3-34)and Vic Pollard (3-27) dismissed Pakistan for only 114. Bruce Murray 90 and Brian Hastings 80* put on 101 for the third wicket and at one stage NZ were 48 ahead with only 2 wickets down. However NZ only mananaged a first innings lead of 127. Pakistan lost six wickets erasing the deficit, Dayle Hadlee taking 3-27, leaving NZ only 81 to win. NZ lost 5 wickets getting them.
The first and third tests were drawn so NZ won the series 1-0. This is still NZ's one and only series win in Pakistan.

8 v Australia at Christchurch 1973/74 NZ won by 5 wickets

NZ played its first test against Australia in 1945/46 and scored 42 and 54. Australia ignored NZ for 28 years after that claiming that NZ were not good enough to play them. NZ lost a 3 match series in Australia, 3-0 in 1973/74 but later in the same summer drew a 3-match series in NZ 1-1.
It was in the second match of this series that NZ achieved its maiden Test win over Australia. Glenn Turner (101 and 110* ) became the first New Zealander to get a century in each innings of a Test. Turner scored nearly half of NZ's runs in the match while no other NZ batsmen got over 50. Turner also held the second innings together as NZ threatened to collapse chasing 228 for victory. Richard Collinge and the Hadlee brothers, Richard and Dayle dismissed Australia for 223 and 259 and gave NZ the chance to chase what appeared to be smallish total for victory. In the end though it required another heroic performance from Turner to secure the win. Australia won the third match to draw the series.

1975/76 to 1984/85

There were two main reasons for NZ's improved test record in this decade. The first was that Sri Lanka were newly granted test status at this time - NZ picked up 4 victories in Sri Lanka's first few years in test cricket, when they were a relatively weak and inexperienced side. The second reason was that NZ had the services of its best ever bowler, Richard Hadlee who made his debut in 1973. Hadlee played in all 13 of the victories in this decade and took 93 wickets at an average of 12.27 in those 13 matches.

9 v India at Wellington 1975/76 NZ won by an innings and 33 runs

New Zealand achieved their first test victory by an innings. India won the toss and chose to bat against NZ's four pronged pace attack. The pitch was easy paced and the Indian openers started well but soon after mid-day Richard Hadlee dismissed the top 3 in 15 balls. His brother Dayle got another. The middle order recovered somewhat and India posted 220 with Richard Hadlee taking 4-35.
Captain Glenn Turner 64, Bevan Congdon 52, got NZ off to a good start and Mark Burgess 95, Lance Cairns 47 and the tail gave NZ a 114 first innings run lead. India's opener Sunil Gavaskar was hit in the cheek while fielding, ended up in hospital and took no further part in the game.
On the fourth day the Indians struggled against the NZ bowlers especially Richard Hadlee who bowled with pace and accuracy and went to lunch at 62 for 3. After lunch Richard Hadlee was irresistible and in 28 balls took 5-10 to finish with 7 for 23. His match figures of 11-58 was a new record for NZ and only the second time a NZ bowler had taken 10 wickets in a match. Jack Cowie took 10-140 v England in 1937.
The 3 match series was drawn 1 all.
Glenn Turner played in 7 more tests after this one before disputes with the NZ Cricket board kept him out of test cricket for 6 years. He then played in 2 victorious tests against Sri Lanka in 1982-83 before retiring aged 35.

10 v England at Wellington 1977/78 NZ won by 72 runs

It took NZ 48 tests and as many years to beat England for the first time. When England were set only 137 to win it seemed highly likely that England's unbeaten run would continue. However, when Richard Collinge bowled Boycott with a fast inswinger the NZ players sensed an upset. Richard Hadlee and Collinge bowling virtually unchanged, poured on the pressure and dismissed the English for 64. Collinge (3 for 35) knocked the top off the order and Hadlee (6 for 26) cleaned up the middle and the tail. Hadlee's match figures were 10 for 100 and Collinge's were 6 for 77. The crowd, realising the historical importance of this victory, cheered the fall of each wicket with the same enthusiasm as those present at NZ's first test victory over 20 years beforehand.
In NZ's first innings John Wright took nearly 6 hours to make 55 on his test debut. In a low scoring game his score was only bettered by Boycott who took 7 and a half hours to make 77. The English won the second test and the 3-match series was drawn 1-1.

11 v West Indies at Dunedin 1979/80 NZ won by 1 wicket

In one of the most acrimonious series of all time NZ achieved their first series win against the West Indies. The West Indies had recently beaten Australia 2-0 in a hard tour and arrived in NZ expecting to thrash the locals. As the West Indies had a side full of great players most of the NZ public expected much the same. Unfortunately for the West Indies they ran into Richard Hadlee, some questionable umpiring and their own petulance, finally leaving NZ with a series loss and their reputations as sportsmen in tatters.
In the West Indies first innings of 140, Hadlee took 5 for 34 with 4 lbws. Although the pitch was keeping low, Don Cameron, a NZ cricket journalist, described the umpiring as "indifferent". NZ replied with 249, Bruce Edgar got 65 and Hadlee a quick 51. When umpire John Hastie gave John Parker not out Michael Holding kicked down the stumps. Parker later went on to score zero. The resulting photo is one of the most famous cricketing photos 16. Ding-dong in Dunedin The West Indies scored 212 in their second bat and Hadlee got 6 for 68 with 3 more lbws. At the time, 12 lbws in the test were a new record. This was the first instance of a NZ player scoring 50 and taking 10 wickets in the same test. NZ needed only 104 to win but lost nine wickets getting to 100. The winning run was a leg bye.
The second and third tests were drawn but marred by more poor umpiring and some shocking behaviour from the West Indies. Among the lowlights from the second test were:
After the tour ended the West Indies board apologised to the NZ Board, the team manager, Rodriguez was replaced, and the players had to sign a contract that had a penalty clause for bad behaviour for the tour of England that followed. Croft was later banned from West Indian cricket for going on a rebel tour to South Africa in 1983. Clive Lloyd, as an ICC match referee, is now somewhat ironically in a position where he has to judge the sportsmanship of current players.
NZ did not lose another series at home until 1991/92. Richard Hadlee retired in 1990.

12 v India at Wellington 1980/81 NZ won by 62 runs

On a green pitch NZ won the toss and chose to bat. Despite movement for the bowlers, NZ finished the first day at 241 for 4. A patient unbeaten 137 over nearly six hours by captain Geoff Howarth got NZ to 375. Howarth's innings was the decisive factor in the match, the rest of which was dominated by the bowlers.
Lance Cairns swung the ball late, and made deep inroads into the Indian batting by the end of the second day. The next day Gary Troup helped Cairns press home the advantage. Cairns took 5 for 33 and Troup 3 for 43. India were all out for 220.
In their second bat, NZ were bowled out for 100, Bruce Edgar top scoring with 28. India had two full days to get 253 but were soon floundering. At lunch they were 75 for 4. Richard Hadlee made up for his wicketless first innings by taking 4 for 65. India were all out for 190 and NZ won with a day to spare. NZ won the 3 match series 1-0.

13 v Australia at Auckland 1981/82 NZ won by 5 wickets

Geoff Howarth won the toss and sent Australia in, and Australia were 77-3 at lunch. Two suicidal runouts at 120 and a couple of poor shots led to Australia being dismissed for 210 Gary Troup took 4-82. Australia regained some ground by having NZ struggling at 35-2 at the end of the first day, but on the second Bruce Edgar batted with certainty - his innings of 161 lasted more than eight and a half hours in all; because of intervals and stoppages for bad light he had to start and restart nine times. An aggressive Howarth (56) helped him add 87 for the third wicket and Jeremy Coney (73) 154 for the fourth wicket. Edgar was seventh out and runs from the tail gave NZ a 177 run first innings lead. Nineteen-year old Martin Crowe, playing in his second test match, scored 2.
With nothing in the pitch for the faster bowlers, Australia reached 167 before losing their second wicket and at the end of the fourth day Australia were 64 ahead on 241-4. On the final morning, Richard Hadlee got Greg Chappell first ball. This so inspired the NZ team that the Australian were all out for 280, Hadlee taking 5-63, leaving NZ only 104 to win. NZ lost 5 wickets getting those runs but achieved their second test victory over Australia.

14 v Sri Lanka at Christchurch 1982/83 NZ won by an innings and 25 runs

The inaugural New Zealand - Sri Lanka test match started two and a half hours late due to overnight rain. Sri Lanka won the toss and invited the New Zealanders to bat. New Zealand started well enough with Glenn Turner making his return to Test cricket after six years. The opening partnership was worth 59 runs but NZ slumped to 93/4 and then later to 171/7. Jeremy Coney (84) and Warren Lees (89) added 79 for the eight wicket. Lees added 42 for the 9th wicket with Martin Snedden 52 for the 10th wicket with Ewen Chatfield NZ finally posted 344.
Lance Cairns (4-49) and Richard Hadlee (4-33) were too good for Sri Lanka and they were dismissed for 144, failing by only 1 run to save the follow-on. Their second innings was hardly happier, all out for 175. Martin Snedden took 3-48 Lance Cairns 4-47 and Ewen Chatfield 3-40.
This was New Zealand's first test victory inside three days and only the second time they had won by an innings. Glenn Turner played 39 test matches for New Zealand between February 1969 and February 1977. A falling out with the NZ cricket authorities lead to Turner not playing for New Zealand for six years. He played two more test matches against Sri Lanka in March 1983, both of which NZ won.

15 v Sri Lanka at Wellington 1982/83 NZ won by 6 wickets

The second test of the inaugural series between Sri Lanka and New Zealand was marred by rain. Although play took place on each of the five days, the match itself lasted little more than eighteen hours. Sent in to bat on a seam-friendly pitch, Sri Lanka slumped to 48/4 by the second morning but were revived by a great stand of 130 for the fifth wicket between Ranjan Madugalle and Somachandra de Silva and eventually reached 240, with Ewen Chatfield taking 4 for 66. New Zealand also struggled in their first innings and looked to be flagging at 169/9, but Sri Lanka's lacklustre fielding allowed New Zealand to pass the 200 mark. Hadlee, who was dropped on 0, struck a quickfire 30 and Cairns, who was also missed before scoring, made a brisk 45 and added 32 for the last wicket with Chatfield, reducing New Zealand's first innings deficit to 39. John Wright had his nose broken by a bouncer but returned to add an additional four runs, taking his total run aggregate past 1000. Sri Lanka then collapsed to 93 in their second innings with wicketkeeper Warren Lees taking five catches. New Zealand knocked off the 133 runs they needed with 6 wickets to spare, reaching the target 48 minutes before lunch with a six from Hadlee.

16 v England at Leeds 1983 NZ won by 5 wickets

New Zealand finally won a Test in England after 17 defeats and 11 draws, overcoming a hostile spell from Bob Willis to secure a five-wicket triumph on the fourth day. It also ended a 16-year drought for an overseas victory and, amazingly, didn't include a wicket from Richard Hadlee, although he deserved much better. Lance Cairns was the hero with ten wickets in the match and seven in the first innings in helpful conditions. England were well placed on 175 for 3 before they lost 7 for 50. John Wright (93) and Bruce Edgar (84) then played key roles in engineering a 152-run win. Edgar had to retire hurt after being hit on the thigh by Ian Botham, but returned to add 84 with Hadlee, who scored a vital 75. Ewen Chatfield bagged five in the second innings. Only David Gower's 112 provided much resistance. The target caused a few wobbles, but Jeremy Coney held his nerve. He later said: "The main feeling was thinking of all the New Zealand players who have been coming here for 52 years, better players than myself, and making sure that their sweat and effort had not been in vain." England hit back to take the final two Tests and claim the four-match series 3-1.. Overjoyed overseas-Eleven of New Zealand's greatest victories abroad

17 v England at Christchurch 1983/84 NZ won by an innings and 132 runs

18 v Sri Lanka at Kandy 1983/84 NZ won by 165 runs

19 v Sri Lanka at Colombo 1983/84 NZ won by an innings and 61 runs

20 v Pakistan at Auckland 1984/85 NZ won by an innings and 99 runs

21 v Pakistan at Dunedin 1984/85 NZ won by 2 wickets

1985/86 to 1994/95

Richard Hadlee played in all of the first 8 test victories of this decade, taking 73 wickets at an average of 13.53. After Hadlee's retirement in 1990, NZ won only 4 of its next 43 tests. Hadlee's contribution to NZ test victories is matched only by that of Shane Bond. Of Hadlee's 86 Tests, New Zealand won 22 and lost 28. Hadlee missed 14 tests during his career and NZ didn't win a single one. By December 2007, of the 17 tests that Bond had played in, NZ had won 9 and lost only  2. Of the 27 tests that Bond missed, NZ won 6 and lost 13.25. New Zealand miss the Bond factor

22 v Australia at Brisbane 1985/86 NZ won by an innings an 41 runs

Richard Hadlee's best bowling performance in an innings (9 for 52) and the 6th best in test history bundled Australia out for 179. Hadlee caught the only batsman he didn't dismiss. Hadlee followed this up with 6 for 71 in Australia's second innings giving him 15 for 123 for the match, the 10th best in test history. (June 2007) See it here 27. Richard Hadlee 15/123 on YouTube
on YouTube. Hadlee's targeting of Andrew Hilditch's weakness (he was a compulsive hooker) was particularly brilliant. Hilditch was caught off Hadlee's bowling at fine leg in both innings and never played for Australia again, although he did become an Australian selector.
Hadlee's haul was so extraordinary that it tends to over-shadow NZ excellent performance with the bat - NZ recorded their highest score against Australia. Martin Crowe (188), John F. Reid (108) and Hadlee (54*) were the main contributors in NZ's 553/7 dec. Crowe and Reid's 3rd wicket partnership of 224 was at the time a new record for NZ.
Australia won the second test in Sydney but NZ won the third in Perth to take the series. Peter English said in 2007 that the series was all about Hadlee. "He may not bowl at the same speed as the West Indian pace battery, but he is a master at his craft." 28. International man of mastery rocks the Gabba

23 v Australia at Perth 1985/86 NZ won by 6 wickets

Another match, another Hadlee masterclass. He picked up 11 wickets at the WACA to give New Zealand their first series win against Australia. He also finished the series with a remarkable 33 victims at 12.15, the best figures in a three-match Test tour since SF Barnes in 1912. New Zealand entered the match with the series at 1-1 - they were unfortunate to have lost the second Test, at the SCG, which could have gone either way. But their medium-fast seamers, who had laboured on hard and fast Australian pitches in the past, found themselves in 1985-86 bowling on surfaces more like those in their own country. It also meant sensible, straight-playing batsman could thrive. It was the perfect combination for New Zealand. Even the renovated WACA ground was not its usual lightning self, though the batsmen were not entirely comfortable, and when New Zealand were set 164 to win at roughly two an over, on a pitch that was breaking up, they were no certainty. But Crowe's unbeaten 42 got them there with six wickets and ten overs to spare.

24 v Australia at Auckland 1985/86 NZ won by 8 wickets

25 v England at Nottingham 1986 NZ won by 8 wickets

26 v West Indies at Christchurch 1986/87 NZ won by 5 wickets

27 v India at Bombay 1988/89 NZ won 136 runs

Hadlee claimed the world wicket-taking record in the first Test but New Zealand predictably lost. When they were 175 for 8 on the opening day of the second match in Mumbai the series was following the expected path. However, John Bracewell scraped together a battling 52 - his first crucial role in a match he would eventually win - to lift New Zealand to 236. Hadlee claimed 6 for 49 and as Wisden reported: "He once again began to dictate terms: none of the remaining batsmen could keep him out as Kris Srikkanth had done at the start." India's last eight wickets went for 100 and they trailed by 2. Andrew Jones' 78 and Ian Smith's 54 set India 282 in 130 overs; they didn't get close. Srikkanth fell to Hadlee's first-ball incutter before Bracewell took over and removed Navjot Sidhu and Dilip Vengsarkar in his first two. There was no way back for India, who were never comfortable against Bracewell. "Azharuddin's nervous start against Bracewell's old-fashioned, yet sharp, off-breaks told the whole tale of how India were being hoist with their own petard," Wisden said. 

28 v India at Christchurch 1989/90 NZ won by 10 wickets

John Wright scored 185 in New Zealand's first innings of 459 while Sir Richard Hadlee took 400th test wicket on his home ground.

29 v Australia at Wellington 1989/90 NZ won by 9 wickets

30 v Zimbabwe at Harare 1992/93 NZ won by 177 runs

31 v Australia at Auckland 1992/93 NZ won by 5 wickets

Australia spent most of this engrossing Test trying to wriggle their way out of trouble after a calamitous opening day. Indeed, they almost wriggled into a winning position, setting New Zealand a thorny target of 201 on a bowlers' pitch. That the home side made the runs with five wickets to spare, and without succumbing to the tension of the occasion, was a measure of their improvement through the series.
Border's decision to bat looked reasonable after an uneventful first hour, but then the clouds enclosed Eden Park and the game underwent a personality change. New Zealand had learned the lessons of Christchurch and dismissed Australia for 139 in conditions conducive to swing and seam bowling. Morrison's lethal fast out-swingers brought him six for 37. This included his 100th Test wicket when he had Healy caught in the gully - though Border, his 99th, was given out caught behind to a delivery that clipped his off stump without removing the bails, the first of several decisions from umpire King that upset the Australians. Morrison became the eighth New Zealander to pass the milestone, in his 29th Test. New Zealand also benefited from the influence of the canny Watson; Martyn, who had replaced Mark Waugh, did well to get an edge to a Watson leg-cutter.
The impression that Eden Park was a swing bowler's paradise was reinforced next day by Steve Waugh, whose potent out-swinger had Crowe caught at first slip attempting to turn the ball to leg. Unfortunately, that resulted in Border holding back Warne - other than a maiden before lunch - until the last hour of the day, when New Zealand led by 39. Once again Warne changed a game's direction, taking four wickets for eight from 15 overs. Collectively the New Zealand batsmen had struck their best form of the series, but had little to show for it: the top five reached 20, but none passed Rutherford's 43, which ended when he danced recklessly down the pitch to Warne's second delivery.
In a bid to swing the delicately balanced series, Crowe tossed the new ball to his off-spinner, Patel. Crowe spoke later of the eerie feeling this created in the opposition, and certainly Australia appeared slightly spooked: Taylor was stumped in Patel's first over and Langer lbw in his second, neither offering a shot. Martyn responded with an aristocratic 74, dropping down on one knee to slap the bowling about. Boon made only 29 of their 107-run partnership before Martyn fell to Greatbatch's acrobatic catch at silly mid-off. But it still took determined contributions from Border and Hughes to scrape together the lead of 200 Australia thought they needed.
The series reached a climax with the heavyweight clash between Hughes and the New Zealand opener Greatbatch, who came out swinging like cowboys in a bar-room brawl. Hughes was affronted by Greatbatch's tactic of charging the bowling and the pair exchanged heated words, brushed chests and Hughes once spat on the ground in Greatbatch's direction. Greatbatch's most extraordinary shot came at the expense of McDermott, whom he charged and deposited into the terraces over wide mid-off. His 29 from 30 balls ended when Hughes uprooted his middle stump, but he had broken the ice. While never dominating Warne, the New Zealand batsmen made a better fist of his bowling than at any other stage in the series, and won in something close to comfort. This would be New Zealand's last test win over Australia for over 18 years.

32 v Pakistan at Christchurch 1993/94 NZ won by 5 wickets

Pakistan led by Saleem Malik and possessing two magnificent fast bowlers, Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram, won the first two matches of the series and were widely expected to complete a clean sweep.
After Pakistan's first innings of 344 (Danny Morrison 4-105 & Simon Doull 3-93) Waqar Younis sliced through NZ's first innings in familiar fashion. Only Andrew Jones (81) stood firm and NZ posted 200.  Thanks to some fine bowling Danny Morrison again (4-66) and Matthew Hart (3-47) Pakistan only got 179 in the third innings. Even so NZ's target of 324 looked far too high. NZ had never scored more than 278 in the fourth innings for a test victory.
Although they had more than 2 days to get them, at 133 for 4, with Jones gone, it did not look likely. But the 154-run stand between Bryan Young (120) and Shane Thomson (120*) transformed the match and gave NZ an unlikely victory.
In late 1998, allegations were made at a Commission headed by Pakistan high court judge Malik Mohammad Qayyum into match fixing that some members of the Pakistan team had deliberately underperformed in matches on this tour. Salim Malik was subsequently banned from cricket for life (later overturned) and Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram were fined.. Corruption in Cricket

33 v South Africa at Johannesburg 1994/95 NZ won by 137 runs

New Zealand marked their first tour of South Africa in 33 years with a victory that stunned the home side in Hansie Cronje's first Test as captain. It was a real team performance: Shane Thomson made 84, Crowe 83, Ken Rutherford 68, and there was a final wicket stand of 57, boosting them to above 400. Then Simon Doull took six wickets, and Matthew Hart five to wrap up the win. Dion Nash had South Africa in early trouble at 38 for 3, although Andrew Hudson's dismissal was shrouded in controversy: replays showed he'd walked for a catch that bounced. It needed Dave Richardson's 93 to avoid the follow-on but Fanie de Villiers brought South Africa back into the match as New Zealand fell to 34 for 5. Stubborn efforts from the lower order set South Africa a target of 327 on a wearing pitch. Hart's left-arm spin proved the trump card, helping to cover for the loss of Nash, who suffered a tour-ending side strain. The series, though, sank rapidly from these heights as New Zealand lost the final two Tests to become the first side since 1888 to lose a three-match series after going ahead. Three players - Hart, Nash and Stephen Fleming - were also suspended for smoking cannabis, and injuries hit the squad badly.

1995/96 to 2004/05

The reason for this was decade being NZ's most productive was the 8 victories recorded against weak opposition, namely Zimbabwe and newcomers Bangladesh. Zimbabwe was never a strong test side but they were severely weakened by the policies of their government. Bangladesh have won three tests since they were granted test status, one against Zimbabwe and two against the West Indies (their first overseas win and series victory), with both teams crippled by player strikes and inept administration. There were also 3 wins against the West Indies which had gone from the best side in the world to one of the weakest in little over a decade.

34 v Pakistan at Lahore 1996/97 NZ won by 44 runs

This was just New Zealand's second win in Pakistan and was inspired by an outstanding display of swing bowling from Doull. He claimed 8 for 85 in the match as New Zealand overcame an impressive debut century from Mohammad Wasim to secure a 44-run win on the fourth day. The opening stages of the match suggested anything but an away win, as Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmed shared eight wickets to blow New Zealand apart for 155. But when their turn came, Pakistan slumped to 37 for 5 against Doull before hauling themselves to a seemingly vital 36-run lead. Chris Cairns turned the match as he came in at 101 for 5 and blasted 93 off 89 balls, while Fleming stood firm with an unbeaten 92. Chasing 276, Pakistan crashed to 60 for 6, and although Wasim resisted, he couldn't deny New Zealand. Cairns admitted it had been an emotional experience. "I went up to Simon to congratulate him on an outstanding performance. I was quite close to tears. Actually, I might have shed the odd tear or two. It was just so great to beat Pakistan over here and be involved with a great bunch of guys." However, Pakistan fought back in the second Test with an innings-and-13-run win to share the series. 

35 v Sri Lanka at Dunedin 1996/97 NZ won by an innings and 36 runs

NZ completed their first home test win for three years through a remarkable innings from Bryan Young who scored 267 not out in the team's total of 586-7 declared.
Sri Lanka won the toss and put NZ in, only to see them bat until tea on the second day. Mathew Horne 66, Stephen Fleming 51, and Chris Cairns 70, contributed fifties to the team total of 586-7 declared. At the time, Young's 267 was the second highest score for NZ,  and 586 was NZ's second highest innings score. The highest score is Martin Crowe's 299 and the highest innings total is 671-4 in the same match. Young was warned of the declaration an hour before it came but chose not to chase down Crowe's 299.
The tea declaration soon paid off and Simon Doull and Heath Davis reduced Sri Lanka to 78â€“4 by stumps. Doull 5â€“58 and  Davis 3â€“34 dismissed Sri Lanka for 222. Stephen Fleming enforced the follow on. Sri Lanka's 328 was an improvement on the first innings but was still a disappointment on an exceptionally good pitch. Doull took 3â€“82 giving him match figures of 8â€“140. Doull took his third five wicket bag of the season, following those against Pakistan and England. He had given NZ the bowling edge but the man of the match award went to Young who had been on the pitch throughout.
This was New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming's first test win as captain.

36 v Sri Lanka at Hamilton 1996/97 NZ won by 120 runs

Teenage left â€“arm spinner Daniel Vettori took 9â€“130 in his fourth test to give NZ their first series win since their visit to Zimbabwe in 1992/93. It was the first time they had won consecutive Tests since they beat Pakistan twice in 1984/85.
On a slow pitch of uneven bounce, Blair Pocock anchored NZ's otherwise undistinguished first innings effort of 222 with 85, an innings whose significance grew clearer as the game developed. It was to be the highest score of the match. None of his team mates reached 30 and the Sri Lankans struggled even more.
The once erratic Heath Davis took 5â€“63 and Vettori 4â€“46. Sri Lanka scored 170 and conceded a lead of 52.
NZ batted Sri Lanka out of the match by extended the lead to 325 thanks to half-centuries to Bryan Young 62,  Stephen Fleming 59, and Nathan Astle 52.
In Sri Lanka's second inning Vettori bowled with relish on his home ground.  He had come within sight of earning NZ victory in his second test; this time he completed the job picking up 5-84. For second successive test NZ won with a day to spare.
The pitch was declared below test standard and dug up a few weeks later.
Heath Davis played only 1 more test, Blair Pocock played 4 more.

37 v Zimbabwe at Wellington 1997/98 NZ won by 10 wickets

38 v Zimbabwe at Auckland 1997/98 NZ won by an innings and 13 runs

39 v Sri Lanka at Colombo 1997/98 NZ won by 167 runs

NZ managed to lose the next 2 tests and lost the series 2â€“1. This was New Zealand's last test victory in Sri Lanka until November 2012.

40 v India at Wellington 1998/99 NZ won by 4 wickets

Simon Doull took 7-65 in India's first innings of 208 in the Boxing Day Test match on 26 December 1998.

41 v England at Lord's 1999 NZ won by 9 wickets

New Zealand let a winning position slip in the opening Test at Edgbaston after having had England on the ropes at 45 for 7. However, at Lord's they were always in control from the time Cairns took advantage of an overcast first day and reduced the home side to 183 for 9, taking 6 for 77 - among those the wicket of Chris Read, who was left looking like an embarrassed schoolboy by a brilliant slower ball. Then Matt Horne's 100 helped New Zealand build a lead of 172, and to compound England's problems they lost Nasser Hussain, their captain, with a broken finger. Second time around, the wickets were shared around the visitors' attack. Geoff Allott, who had been one of the stars of the World Cup a few weeks earlier, claimed three. It left New Zealand needing 58 and they completed their first win at Lord's in 13 attempts, and their first win in England since 1986. 

42 v England at The Oval 1999 NZ won by 83 runs

England and NZ were tied one all going into the 4th test. England picked 4 number 11s,[ref]The Jack of all rabbits
[/ref] Andy Caddick, Alan Mullally, Phil Tufnell and Ed Giddins to go up against NZ's last 4, Chris Cairns, Dion Nash, Daniel Vettori and Shane O'Conner. NZ batted first and were in deep trouble at 87 for 6 until Stephen Fleming (66*) put on 149 with the last 4 wickets, (Vettori 51 off 48 balls). Cairns took 5 for 31 in England's first innings of 153, the last four English wickets contributed 59. NZ were in even deeper trouble in the second innings at 39 for 6 but then Carns smashed 80 off 93 balls and helped put on 123 for the last four wickets. England were set 246 for victory and were well placed at 123 for 2 but then lost 8 wickets for 39 with the last four adding 15. Nash got 4 for 39.
Over 2 innings, NZ's last 4 scored a total of 183 runs and England's 4 number 11s scored a total of 27. Cairns got man of the match and NZ a rare series win over England.

43 v West Indies at Hamilton 1999/00 NZ won by 9 wickets

Only the fourth instance in tests of one partnership being worth more than the other 19 partnerships of their team.95.Solitary Partnerships
The West Indian opening pair, Campbell and Griffith scored 276 for the first wicket and batted for nearly the entire first day. The West Indies then lost 10 wickets for 89 runs, (Vettori 4 for 83 and Chris Cairns 3 for 73) and in the second innings were all out for 97, with Chris Cairns getting 7 for 27, his best bowling in an innings. His 10 for 100 was the only time he took 10 wickets in a test match.
Fleming, McMillian and Cairns all got fifties with all of the first 8 batsmen making a contribution in NZ's first innings of 393. NZ even managed a small first innings lead, something that looked highly unlikely when the West Indies were 282 for 1 at close of play on day one. The fact that NZ won by 9 wickets, (one of their biggest wins by wickets), was even more remarkable.

44 v West Indies at Wellington 1999/00 NZ won by an innings and 105 runs

45 v Zimbabwe at Bulawayo 2000/01 NZ won by 7 wickets

46 v Zimbabwe at Harare 2000/01 NZ won by 8 wickets

47 v Pakistan at Hamilton 2000/01 NZ won by an innings and 185 runs

48 v Bangladesh at Hamilton 2001/02 NZ won by an innings and 52 runs

49 v Bangladesh at Wellington 2001/02 NZ won by an innings and 74 runs

50 v England at Auckland 2001/02 NZ won by 83 runs

This was New Zealand's 50th test victory. Adam Parore and Chris Drum retired after this test.

51 v West Indies at Bridgetown 2001/02 NZ won by 204 runs

Thirty years after they played their first Test in the Caribbean, New Zealand finally won a match there, and comprehensively at that.
In the first innings, Stephen Fleming, who had said New Zealanders' mental image of cricket in the West Indies was of "guys being hit on the helmet, broken bones, and fire and brimstone", led the way with 130 against an attack that was anything but life-threatening. Mervyn Dillon, Daren Powell, Pedro Collins and Adam Sanford were hardly of the Holding and Roberts mould. Wicket-keeper Robbie Hart (57 *) playing in only his second test added 108 with Fleming and 112 with the last 4 batsman.
Most of West Indies' batsmen were not in the Richards and Lloyd category either. Not even Brian Lara could stop Daniel Vettori (4-27) and Ian Butler (3-26), running through the West Indies for 107.
Nathan Astle scored 77 in NZ's second bat and NZ set the West Indies a massive 473 to win with over two days remaining.
Shane Bond picked up Gayle and Sarwan with the first new ball and Lara and two tailenders with the second. He got his first five-wicket haul in tests (5-78) and confirmed the 204 run win within four days.
NZ fans began to dream of a new ball attack of Butler, Bond and Tuffey providing many victories in the coming years. Sadly all three player's careers were cut short by injury. Butler played only 5 more tests and Bond only 12. After a five-year absence due to injury and recovery, Butler started playing again for NZ in ODI matches in 2009. On 8 September 2009, all three played in the same ODI in Sri Lanka.Butler bounces back

52 v India at Wellington 2002/03 NZ won by 10 wickets

53 v India at Hamilton 2002/03 NZ won by 4 wickets

This was the second occasion that part of all four innings had taken place on the same day of a Test India started the third day (the first was washed out) at 92 for 8 in their first innings, and were soon all out for 99; New Zealand were bowled out for 94; India went in and out again for 154; and by the end of the day New Zealand, chasing 160 to win, were 24 without loss and completed a four-wicket victory next morning. The other occasion was the second day of the 2000 lord's test between England and the West Indies.

54 v South Africa at Auckland 2003/04 NZ won by 9 wickets

New Zealand's maiden test victory over South Africa in New Zealand. Chris Cairns was the major contributor when he took his 200th test wicket and scored his 3000th test run. Scott Styris scored 170 in this match.

55 v Bangladesh at Dhaka 2004/05 NZ won by an innings and 99 runs

James Franklin claimed New Zealand's second test hat-trick in this test.

56 v Bangladesh at Chittagong 2004/05 NZ won by an innings and 101 runs

57 v Sri Lanka at Wellington 2004/05 NZ won by an innings and 38 runs

2005/06 to 2014/15

from 7 August 2005

58 v Zimbabwe at Harare 2005/06 NZ won by an innings and 294 runs

NZ achieved its largest ever test victory at the time. The game was so one-sided that it was over in two days. NZ, batting first, scored 452 for 9 on day one. They were looking shaky at 113 for 5 but were rescued by Fleming (73), McCullum (111) and Vettori (127). McCullum got his second test century off 94 balls and Vettori scored NZ's fastest test century off 82 balls. Shane Bond, batting at number 10, also got his highest test score, 41* from 38 balls.
NZ declared overnight and bowled Zimbabwe out twice on day two, only the second time this has happened in the history of test cricket, (England bowled India out for 58 and 82 at Manchester in 1952). New Zealand bowled Zimbabwe out for 59 and 99. When scores are as low as these it is common for all the bowlers to get wickets and Vettori's 4 for 28 in the second innings were the best bowling figures in the game.
On 18 January 2006 Zimbabwe Cricket announced that it was suspending its participation in test matches because its players were not up to test standard. With much of the cricket world clamouring for the ICC to suspend Zimbabwe's test status, it was very much a case of "jumping before being pushed".97.How much longer must this go on?

59 v Zimbabwe at Bulawayo 2005/06 NZ won by an innings and 46 runs

Zimbabwe won the toss but when they chose to bat first their woes continued. Shane Bond recorded his best figures in first class cricket taking 6 for 51. See it here 27. Shane Bond 6/51 on YouTube
on Youtube. Zimbabwe were 7 for 3 at one stage but recovered somewhat to 231.
New Zealand replied with 484, with Lou Vincent making 92, Fleming 65 and Astle 128, his 11th test century.
Bond picked up 4 more wickets in Zimbabwe's second innings to get his first 10 wicket bag in first class cricket (10 for 99). Zimbabwe couldn't improve on their first innings score and lost by an innings again but did managed to take the game into the third day.
Calls to suspend Zimbabwe from test cricket were renewed by those who believed Zimbabwe were devaluing the game and by those who wanted to punish Mugabe's regime. The NZ government had encouraged NZ cricket to call off this tour but NZ cricket refused, citing contractual obligations.
The game itself ended in farce. Chris Mpofu was run out by Brendon McCullum when he left his crease to congratulate his partner on his half century before the ball was dead. As the incident happened at the end of a no contest and in a far away country, no aspersions were cast on McCullum's or the Black Caps' lack of sportsmanship. 3 victories later Muralitharan's run out in similar circumstances would stir up quite a hornet's nest.

60 v West Indies at Auckland 2005/06 NZ won by 27 runs

This was New Zealand's narrowest victory by runs, until the win at Hobart in 2011. In fact, only an astounding piece of luck, some atrocious batting from the West Indies and some great bowling from Shane Bond enabled NZ to escape defeat. The West Indies were 140 for 0 chasing 290 for victory when Gayle hit a six on to the roof of the stand. The replacement ball was younger than the lost ball and started to reverse swing. Bond bowled accurately and aggressively and ripped out the middle order in a 4 wicket burst, eventually finishing with 5 for 69.100.A Six to rue
NZ's top order failed in both inninngs and NZ was in trouble at 69 for 4 in the first innings and 4 for 88 in the second. A century by Scott Styris and a fifty from Nathan Astle saved NZ from humiliation in the first innings and 74 from Brendon McCullum saved them in the second.
This was New Zealand's 60th test victory coming 50 years to the day after its first test victory in 1956.

61 v West Indies at Wellington 2005/06 NZ won by 10 wickets

When Shane Bond, NZ's best fast bowler since Richard Hadlee, withdrew from the match 10 minutes before the start of play the West Indies must have fancied their chances of drawing level in the series. Instead James Franklin bowled full, swung the ball both ways and knocked the top of the West Indian order with 5 for 53. In reply to 192, NZ scored 372 with Peter Fulton in his second match scoring 75, Fleming got 97 and Astle 65.
In the West Indies second innings the NZ bowlers stuck to their task and kept chipping away at the demoralized West Indians finally leaving themselves only 36 runs for their fifth victory in 5 consecutive games, their best ever winning streak, indeed their only winning streak of any note. For the West Indies on the other hand, this was their eighth consecutive loss, their worst losing streak in history. Rain in the third test brought both streaks to an end.
In his last visit to NZ Brian Lara's performance was symptomatic of his team's woes. He scored 5, 0, 1, 1 in the first 2 tests which were lost, before getting 83 in the 3rd test which was drawn.

62 v Sri Lanka at Christchurch 2005/06 NZ won by 5 wickets

Scorecard 
Murali run out 
No regrets on controversial run out - Fleming 
Eighteen months later McCullum was at it again - and this time the controversy raged for days. You would, however, have assumed that the man at his mercy, Muttiah Muralitharan, should have known better. He and Kumar Sangakkara had been engaged in a tense battle for survival in a low-scoring contest, and had added 27 vital runs for the tenth wicket when Sangakkara clipped Shane Bond down to fine leg to bring up an excellent century. Murali tapped his bat into his crease to complete the run, then turned at once to congratulate his partner. At the same instant, the return throw came in from the boundary, and McCullum didn't think twice about breaking the wicket and putting in his appeal. The ball was not dead, so it was a justifiable move (if not entirely in the spirit of the game), and when New Zealand lost five wickets in pursuit of 119 for victory, it assumed even greater importance in hindsight. The Sri Lankans were furious, and a week later translated that anger into a crushing series-levelling win - with their two protagonists sharing the spoils with ten wickets and 156 not out respectively.

63 v Bangladesh at Dunedin 2007/08 NZ won by 9 wickets

NZ thrashed Bangladesh 3-0 in the One Day series just prior to this test so the NZ players and fans had high expectations of two easy victories in the test series as well. When Bangladesh were bowled out for 137 ( Chris Martin  4 for 64) on the first day everyone's expectations looked like they would be met. NZ replied with 357 with Matthew Bell who was playing his first test for 6 years, and Jacob Oram scoring centuries. Apart from Bell, Oram and Martin the NZers batted poorly. Martin is infamous for his lack of ability with the bat but got to double figures (12) for the first time in a record 49 innings. NZ's 357 was not a good batting performance on a good pitch against a weak bowling attack.  This was underlined by the Bangladeshi openers, who put on 161 in a record opening stand against all countries.
However on day 3, the NZ bowlers recovered their composure and took all 10 second innings wickets for 93 runs. The four seamers knocked off the top of the order and Vettori (4 for 70) mopped up the tail. NZ did not get the expected innings victory, but they were close with a 9 wicket win well inside 3 days. NZ's opener Craig Cumming scored 1 & 4 against the weakest attack in test cricket (Zimbabwe had been suspended) but was retained for the next test.
NZ has beaten Bangladesh in all 5 tests that they have played but this was the only test where NZ did not win by an innings.

64 v Bangladesh at Wellington 2007/08 NZ won by an innings and 137 runs

Vettori won the toss again and put Bangladesh in again. On a better pitch than the previous test in Dunedin the Bangladeshis could only manage 6 runs more, largely because NZ bowled better than in Dunedin, especially Chris Martin, who troubled the batsmen with pace, bounce and movement in both directions and picked up his eighth five-wicket haul in Tests, (5âˆ’65).
Bangladesh bowled reasonably well for the first 71 overs of the NZ innings and had NZ at 242 for 6 with Stephen Fleming out for 87, but then Daniel Vettori came in and smashed 94 in 87 balls off the tiring Bangladeshi bowlers. NZ finished with 393, a 250 run first innings lead.
Another poor performance with the bat followed and Bangladesh were all out for 113 before lunch on the third day. Stephen Fleming took 3 catches in the match and moved into second place on the "most test catches in the field in a career" list. He finished the match with 166, 15 behind the leader Mark Waugh. The innings victory that everyone had expected since the start of the series eventuated (this was NZ's third most comprehensive victory) NZ cricket fans and players turned their eyes to the England series that followed this one. In fact, expectations of Bangladesh were so low even while NZ was playing them most people had at least one eye on England series. Jonathan Millmow in the Dominion Post went so far as to say :
 
 ... victory will have a hollow feel. Nothing has been achieved against a weak side, save Chris Martin who looks at the top of his game with the England series around the corner.
 
Three out of five of NZ's top order largely squandered their chance to score easy runs against the Bangladeshis and Craig Cumming was dropped for the first test against the English.

65 v England at Hamilton 2007/08 NZ won by 189 runs

Vettori won the man of the match award for some match saving batting, fine bowling and aggressive captaincy but his biggest contribution to NZ's victory was winning the toss and choosing to bat on a flat track. Jamie How (92) apart, the NZ top order failed to capitalise on Vettori's luck but Ross Taylor (120) McCullum (51) and Vettori (88) pushed the NZ total up to 470. The English started batting for a draw right from the off and when they were dismissed for 348 off 173.1 overs after lunch on Day 4 it looked as though they might have succeeded.
In their second innings NZ sought quick runs; How (39) and Fleming (66) got them up to 99/1 but when NZ tried to lift the tempo they crashed to 141/8. Only Vettori's valuable 35 enabled NZ to declare and set the English 300 to win off 81 overs. The English started positively but Kyle Mills dismissed the first 4 batsman for 30 runs and the English went back to playing for a draw again. Paul Collingwood took over an hour to score 2 runs but after he was bowled by Vettori the English tail offered little resistance and NZ won with a session to spare on Day 5.
NZ's four most inexperienced players, How (7 matches), Taylor (3), Jeetan Patel (2) and Mills (10) made big contributions to this victory. How and Taylor got their highest test scores 92 and 120, respectively and Patel and Mills their best bowling figures 3/107 and 4/16, respectively.
This was also Stephen Fleming's last series for NZ and he finished the series with 111 matches, 7172 career runs, and 171 career catches, all records for NZ.
NZ lost the next 2 tests and as a result lost the series 2-1. This was the third time NZ had lost a series after winning the first match in the last 10 years.

66 v Bangladesh at Chittagong 2008/09 NZ won by 3 wickets

Daniel Vettori came within 3 runs of top scoring in both of NZ's turns at bat and having the best bowling figures in both of the opposition's innings, something no player has ever achieved.  He scored 55* & 76 and took 5âˆ’59 & 4âˆ’74.  Without Vettori's contribution Bangladesh would have achieved their first test win against decent opposition (i.e. not Zimbabwe). As it was Bangladesh were ahead for the first 3 and a half days of the test and NZ only won by 3 wickets.
Bangladesh batted first and despite being 4âˆ’44 managed to get to 245. In addition to Vettori's 5âˆ’59, Iain O'Brien also bowled very well for 3âˆ’36. NZ replied with what Dylan Cleaver writing in the NZ Herald described as:
 
 "the nadir, rock bottom, ground zero of batting efforts during the Bracewell era; all against a spin bowling attack that did nothing but put the ball in the right place most of the time."
  Vettori batting at eight, top scored with 55* out of 171.
Bangladesh's second bat was a repeat of the first; 4âˆ’49 then recovering to 242, Vettori took 4âˆ’74.
NZ were left with a target of 317 to win. NZ's top 3 all managed decent contributions this time around but when number 3, Jesse Ryder (38) fell at 145 just before stumps on the fourth day, Vettori either sent himself in as nightwatchman, or promoted himself to number 4 because he didn't have faith in middle order. Publicly, its the former, but many suspect the latter.  Vettori added 40 with opener Aaron Redmond (79) and 82 with Daniel Flynn (49).  When Vettori finally fell at 298 he had scored 27% of NZ runs, had dismissed 45% of the Bangladeshis, and had saved NZ from an embarrassing defeat.
NZ's target of 317 was the second highest score NZ had chased to win a test. The highest score of 324/5 is against Pakistan, on a tour which included an ODI that Pakistan deliberately underperformed in.

67 v Pakistan at Dunedin 2009/10 NZ won by 32 runs

Shane Bond played his first test for 2 years and won the test for NZ with match figures of 8âˆ’153. NZ batted first and scored 429 with Martin Guptill getting 60, Ross Taylor 94, Daniel Vettori 99 and Brendon McCullum 78. Despite being 34 years old, Bond bowled as fast as ever and with a devastating second spell reduced Pakistan to 85-5. Pakistan eventually recovered to 332 and Bond finished with 5âˆ’107.
Although Ross Taylor got another fifty, (59) inept batting from NZ in the second innings saw them all out for 153, leaving Pakitan a target of just 251. However, NZ's bowling attack of Bond, Chris Martin, Iain O'Brien and Vettori bowled well enough to make up for the brainless batting of the NZ batsmen in the second innings. Pakistan were all out for 219. Bond took 3âˆ’46.
Bond however bowled 48.5 overs in the match, suffered an injury, and was invalided out of the rest of the series. He later retired from test cricket. Bond's contribution to the test side was immense. Of the 18 tests that he played in NZ won 10.
NZ lost the second test of the series and the third was drawn. The test series was drawn 1âˆ’-1. O'Brien retired from international cricket at the end of the series.

68 v Bangladesh at Hamilton 2009/10 NZ won by 121 runs

Bangladesh won the toss and sent NZ in to bat. Their boldness seemed to have paid off when they had reduced NZ to 158/5 but then Martin Guptill (189) and Brendan McCullum (185) shared a new 6th wicket record partnership against all countries of 339. NZ declared at 553/7.
NZ bowled poorly and Bangladesh replied with 408.
NZ added another 258 (258/5 dec) to their first innings lead of 145 leaving Bangladesh with a target of 404 to win. Guptill added 56* to his first inning score. Tim McIntosh got 89 and Ross Taylor 51.
NZ bowled better than in the first innings, but not by much, and Bangladesh were dismissed for 282.
Despite the victory the NZ cricket team received scant praise from the NZ press. Mark Richardson writing in the NZ Herald was typical:
 
 We aren't totally happy, which is a rarity after a Black Caps test victory. But this test was not totally about the result because you simply don't lose to Bangladesh. It's more a case of how well you win.
We did not win in a fashion that would have alleviated any fears we have about the challenge of facing Australia. In fact, we probably have as many, if not more, concerns than before the game.
How are we going to get 20 Australian wickets? Wellington and Hamilton in March will be good batting surfaces and, right now, the bowling lacks penetration.
They took all 20 Bangladesh wickets but that was more a result of some awful batting from the tourists than a systematic dismantling from New Zealand.

In the test series that followed, Australia beat NZ 2-nil.

69 v Zimbabwe at Bulawayo 2011/12 NZ won by 34 runs

New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat on a lifeless Bulawayo surface. Martin Guptill (109), Ross Taylor (76) in his first Test as captain, and Dean Brownlie on debut, left NZ well placed for a big score at 400/5 but NZ lost their last 5 wickets for just 26 more runs.
Zimbabwe were bowled out 113 runs adrift. Chris Martin picked up his 200th test wicket but Vettori was the main destroyer with 5-70, the 20th time he has taken 5-wickets in an innings.
In New Zealand's second innings Ross Taylor scored 76 for the second time in the match and Kane Williamson got 68. NZ declared at 252/8 setting Zimbabwe a target of 366 in 114 overs.
Zimbabwe lost 2 wickets in the final session on the 4th day but were well placed at 265/3 at tea on the 5th day. However they collapsed dramatically against Daniel Vettori and Doug Bracewell and lost 7 wickets for 66 runs. Doug Bracewell, son of Brendon Bracewell and nephew of John Bracewell, with 5-85 became the seventh New Zealander to pick up a five-wicket bag on test debut. However Vettori picked up the man of the match award for his all round performance âˆ’ 40 & 31 with the bat and 5âˆ’70 & 3âˆ’71 with the ball.

70 v Australia at Hobart 2011/12 NZ won by 7 runs

Australia won the toss and put NZ in on a green pitch in Hobart and bowled NZ out for 150 with Dean Brownlie, playing in only his third match, top scoring with 56.
Australia fared even worse in their turn at bat scoring only 136. 37-year old Chris Martin got the first three batsman (3â€“46). Trent Boult on his debut got 3â€“29 and Doug Bracewell, also playing in only his third match, took 3-20.
The Hobart pitch was becoming easier to bat on as the game progressed and NZ managed 226 in their second turn at bat. Ross Taylor top scored with 56.
Australia began their chase of 241 very well and were 72 without loss at close of play on the 3rd day. Australia were still well in control at 159-2 then Bracewell changed the game in 2 overs dismissing Ponting (16), Clarke (0) and Hussey (0) and suddenly Australia were looking vulnerable at 159-5. Warner and Haddin added 33 valuable runs but then Tim Southee grabbed 2 wickets in the 54th over. Bracewell took another 2 wickets in the 55th over and Australia were reeling at 199-9. Australia's last pair added 34 runs taking Australia to the brink of victory. When Bracewell finally bowled the number 11, just 7 runs short, the NZers celebrated their first victory in Australia for 26 years. See the last day's highlights here .

Bracewell took 6âˆ’40 in the second innings, 9âˆ’60 in the match and won the game for NZ. However, the Australian public were deciding the man of the match and they overwhelmingly chose Australian opening batsman Warner who carried his bat for 123*. This was the first and last series in which the Australian public chose the man of the match.

71 v Zimbabwe at Napier 2011/12 NZ won by an innings and 301 runs

NZ achieved its largest ever test victory, bettering the victory over Zimbabwe at home in 2005 by seven runs. The entire match was completed in just over two days of playing time.
New Zealand was put in to bat by Zimbabwe and scored 495/7 declared. Martin Guptill (51) and Brendon McCullum (83) laid the foundation with an opening partnership of 124. Ross Taylor scored 122 before retiring hurt and BJ Watling, playing as the wicket keeper for the first time, scored his first century for New Zealand.  NZ declared soon after Watling reached his hundred.
Only 15 overs were possible on the second day of the match but the weather was perfect for day 3.  NZ used the first 18 overs of the day to add another 103 runs and then the same four pace bowlers that ran through Australia in Hobart 2 months previously, bowled Zimbabwe out twice in the same the day.
Chris Martin, Trent Boult, Doug Bracewell and Tim Southee all took 2 wickets in Zimbabwe's first innings of 51. This was the lowest scored NZ had ever bowled a test team out for.
Zimbabwe followed on and fared a little better, all out for 143. Martin's 6âˆ’26 in the innings, was his best performance in first class cricket, and was the 10th best bowling performance for NZ. He was named man-of-the match. Martin also moved into third place on the most-wickets-for-New Zealand list, behind Richard Hadlee and Daniel Vettori and tied with Chris Cairns.
Zimbabwe did not play test cricket from September 2005 to August 2011. This match was their first away match since they started playing test cricket again in August 2011.

72 v Sri Lanka at Colombo 2012/13 NZ won by 167 runs

NZ's victory against Australia in Hobart 12 months previously was trumpeted as a harbinger of future success. Instead NZ went into this match having lost 5 tests in a row. It was New Zealand's first Test win in Sri Lanka since 1998.
NZ won the toss and batted but soon found themselves in the familiar situation of being two down for not very many. However, Kane Williamson (135) and Ross Taylor (142) put on 262 â€“ NZ's sixth highest partnership. Daniel Flynn (53) and the tail provided some more runs and NZ finished with 412. Williamson's 135 was his highest score.
Tim Southee, swinging the new ball beautifully, led the attack and Sri Lanka were 12âˆ’3 and then 105-5. Southee snared 4 of the first 5 wickets to fall. As the ball aged the Sri Lankans found batting easier but when Southee and Trent Boult got hold of the second new ball they lost their last 4 wickets for 19 runs. Southee finished with 5-62 and Boult with 4-42. This was Boult's best bowling in an innings.
NZ had a 168 run first-innings lead but a collapse to 75-5 in their second innings set kiwi supporter's hearts a flutter, but then Taylor (74) and Todd Astle (35), on his debut put on 97 runs. NZ declared at 194/9 setting Sri Lanka 363 runs to win.
Southee and Doug Bracewell reduced Sri Lanka to 47-4 at stumps on the fourth day. Sri Lanka's second top order failure of the match left them with only one option - to play for a draw. They limped through to 168/7 before Taylor took the second new ball and Boult and Southee cleaned up the tail in six overs. Sri Lanka were all out for 195.
Taylor scored 216 runs in the match and Williamson 153. Both Southee (8âˆ’120) and Boult (7âˆ’75) got their best bowling figures in a match. David Leggat writing in the NZ Herald said:
 
 Southee, since returning after missing the first test in India in August, has taken 20 wickets in three tests, including a career-best seven for 64 at Bangalore. He is now the country's leading fast-medium bowler... Boult has found his feet at the top level and the ability to bring the ball in late to the righthanders and slide it across makes him a genuine threat.Consistency's the next big test

Taylor was ranked the 8th best batsmen in the world after this match. McCullum was the NZ's next highest ranked batsman at 27th.
Soon after Taylor's match winning performance he was sacked as captain by NZ Cricket. It later emerged that coach Mike Hesson told Taylor that he was going to recommend that Taylor be replaced as captain before the Sri Lankan series had even begun. After his performance in the second test NZ Cricket offered Taylor the test captaincy as a compromise. Taylor refused this offer and also refused to tour South Africa in December 2012 and January 2013.
The reason given for his sacking was his poor winning record over his 13 tests âˆ’ 4 won, 7 lost, and 2 drawn. In fact, Taylor's record as captain is very similar to Stephen Fleming's and Daniel Vettori's. Fleming won 5 of his first 13 tests and Vettori 4. David Leggat writing in the NZ Herald states that the poor winning record is not entirely Taylor's fault and doubts whether installing McCullum as captain will make any difference.
The following table shows that the only batsman adequately performing during his tenure was Ross Taylor himself.
Condemnation of the way NZ Cricket had handled the process was widespread, vociferous and persistent. David Leggat described NZ Cricket's handling of the episode as "disastrous".
Brendon McCullum became NZ's 28th test captain and faced the prospect of a tour to South Africa, (ranked the number one test side), without NZ's best batsman.
On Dec 13, New Zealand Cricket Board chairman Chris Moller apologised to "Ross Taylor and his family for the manner in which events have unfolded", but added that "No heads are going to roll". He also announced that special general meeting would be called next year and a new constitution ushered in. Moller also referred to "additional material" the board had considered In response Taylor tweeted "I appreciate the apology from NZC today. Keen to put it behind me and looking forward to getting back with the team soon."
In January 2013 the "additional material" Moller had referred to in December 2012 was revealed to be a letter that Shane Bond wrote to the NZC Board in which he stated:
 
 "I believe the coach has been dishonest in his assertion around the miscommunication of the captaincy split with Ross", "it was clear to me that Ross Taylor was to be removed as captain from all three formats" and "by remaining silent I believe I have become complicit in what has occurred, which I believe is the calculated removal of the captain and the subsequent cover-up to save face."

McCullum won his first toss as captain against South Africa and decided to bat on a green top. NZ were dismissed for 45, their 3rd lowest score ever. NZ lost this test by an innings and 27 runs, in 3 days. NZ lost the second test by an even bigger margin - an innings and 193 runs.
In January 2013, NZ was ranked eighth in all three formats. As a result, the International Cricket Council decided that the quality of the Black Caps was so poor that they would give NZ Cricket NZ$2.14 million over the next three years "to help drag itself out of the international cricket doldrums." 


73 v West Indies at Wellington 2013/14 NZ won by an innings and 73 runs

Rain saved the West Indies in the first test in Dunedin, when NZ were 33 runs away from victory with 6 wickets left. Some play was lost to rain in this test as well but not enough to prevent NZ winning on the third day of the test. Just as in Dunedin, the West Indies skipper won the toss and had no hesitation in putting New Zealand in on a green pitch. Just as in Dunedin the West Indies bowled poorly and NZ amassed a big first innings score. The openers failed again but Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson (45) put on 88 for the third wicket, Taylor and Brendon McCullum(37) put on 77 for the fourth wicket, and Taylor and Corey Anderson (38) put on 68 for the fifth wicket. Taylor's 129 was his tenth Test hundred and his second century in consecutive tests. He scored 217 in Dunedin. After Taylor departed at 296, BJ Watling and the tail added a further 145 runs.
At the end of day two the West Indies were reasonably well placed at 158/4, chasing NZ's first innings score of 441. However, on they morning of the third day they collapsed to NZ's swing and pace in a further 12.5 overs and were dismissed for 193. Trent Boult took 6 of the last 7 wickets to fall and finished with 6/40.
Following on the West Indies got to 74 without loss but Tim Southee took 3 quick wickets. Boult cleaned up the tail, taking 4-40, giving him 10/80 in the match and the man of the match award. This was his first 10 wicket bag in first class cricket.
This was McCullum's first victory in his eleventh test as captain.

74 v West Indies at Hamilton 2013/14 NZ won by 8 wickets

NZ won the toss and put the West Indies in. They went to lunch comfortably placed at 77/1. After lunch they lost 4 for 9 and slumped to 86/5 on a pitch that was not assisting the seamers to any degree. The West Indies put on 200 for the sixth wicket and were looking good at 286/5 but were eventually bowled out for 367. Tim Southee took 4/79 and Corey Anderson 3/49.
On a pitch taking turn the NZ openers again got starts but failed to go on. Ross Taylor was again involved in good partnerships with the middle order batsmen. He put on 95 with Kane Williamson (58), 36 with McCullum (12), 50 with Anderson (39), and 45 with Watling. When Taylor (131) got out at 306/7 he had again held the New Zealand innings together and had scored his third century in successive tests. New Zealand finished with a small first innings deficit of 17.
With a small first innings lead, and a fine spinner in Sunil Narine to bowl at NZ who had to bat fourth on a pitch taking spin, the West Indies were in the box seat at tea on the third day. However the West Indies were all out for a 103 in a single session. New Zealand's four-man pace attack were relentless with their tight lines and fuller lengths. Trent Boult took the first three West Indies wickets and Tim Southee took three wickets in the last over of the innings to end with 3-12 - his second wicket making him the 12th New Zealand player to capture 100 test wickets. Boult finished with 4-23.
New Zealand had to chase down 122 to win. Kane Williamson scored 56 and Hamish Rutherford 48*.
New Zealand completed their first series victory over a top-eight nation since they beat the same opposition in 2006. Against one of the weakest West Indies side to ever visit New Zealand, the homeside were dominant in all three mathces. But for rain in Dunedin they would have won the series 3-0.
Deposed captain Ross Taylor scored three centuries in each of the three tests finishing the series with 495 runs at an average of 247.50. At the end of the series his career average stood at 47.51 which is better than the averages that Martin Crowe (45.36) and Glenn Turner (44.64) finished their careers with. At the end of this series only two New Zealanders had more centuries than Taylor - Martin Crowe (17) and John Wright (12).
All-rounder Corey Anderson, playing in his first home series, took 8 wickets at an average of 18.37 and scored 97 runs at an average of 32.33. Kane Williamson also averaged 53 with the bat. Boult took 20 wickets in the series at an average of 15.40 while Southee grabbed 18 scalps at 18.11

75 v India at Auckland 2013/14 NZ won by 40 runs

On a grassy drop-in pitch at Eden Park, the Indian captain was delighted to win the toss and bowl. Not long after, New Zealand were 30 for 3. Kane Williamson and Brendon McCullum responded with aggressive hundreds and added 221 in 51 overs. Williamson scored 113 and McCullum was not out on 143 at the end of day one. NZ was in complete control of the match at 329/4.
The following day McCullum added another 174 runs with the tail and was last out for 224, one short of his highest test score. Corey Anderson scored 77 and New Zealand finished with 503.
Trent Boult took two wickets in the first over of India's innings and Tim Southee bounced out Virat Kohli in the fifth over. India recovered somewhat to end day two on 130/4. On a humid day three morning the New Zealand fast bowlers ripped through India. In 13 overs from Boult and Southee, India could manage only 28 for 2. Once Southee and Boult finished their spells, Neil Wagner maintained the same intensity and picked up three of the last four wickets. The tail could only add 35 runs after Dhoni's dismissal and India were bowled out for 202, 45 minutes before lunch. Both Boult and Southee took 3/38 and Wagner 4/64.
Bizarrely, McCullum did not enforce the follow-on. New Zealand's second innings was a classic example of a Black Caps batting collapse. They were 15/4 at lunch on the third day. Ross Taylor top scored with 41 and the last pair added 25. Nevertheless the 301-run first innings lead combined with their second innings score of 105 left India with a very challenging target of 407 to win in over two days on a flat wicket. (The highest successful fourth innings target is 418)
The Indian top order kept their team in the chase. After 80 overs India were well placed at 268/5. However, the arrival of the second new ball sealed their fate. Boult took a wicket with the first delivery of the second new ball and Southee with the seventh. India lost their last 5 wickets for 98 runs in 16.3 overs against the second new ball and NZ secured a thrilling 40-run win. The NZ fast bowlers, Southee, Boult, and Wagner took all 20 wickets in the match. Southee, Boult took 3 wickets in each innings and Wagner took 4 wickets in each innings. Neil Wagner's match figures of 8 for 126 were his best in a Test Match. His previous-best was 7 for 116 against Bangladesh in Mirpur last year. McCullum was named the player of the match.
David Leggat in the NZ Herald wrote:
 
 Tim Southee, Trent Boult and Neil Wagner have a look about them that suggests they are well down the road to becoming one of New Zealand's better seam groups. Southee and Boult have tended to garner more headlines than the bustling Otago left armer Wagner. But on Sunday, as Wagner charged in during a hostile 10-over spell on a warm afternoon when the test was in the balance, he was outstanding. Seldom can a spell of 10-3-26-2 by a New Zealand bowler have had an impact so far outweighing the bare numbers. He removed Virat Kohli when the Indian champion was sailing along on 67, then produced a snorting lifter to remove centurymaker Shikhar Dhawan to turn the contest at a point where India were in cruise mode.


Jesse Ryder who had made a return to playing limited overs cricket for NZ was named as 12th man. The night before the test started he was out drinking until the wee hours with the 13th man, Doug Bracewell . Even though they did not make the team they sure made the headlines and the NZ cricket team were reportedly livid that their misbehaviour gained more attention that their stunning victory.
Despite most of the batsmen performing adequately (see table below) during McCullum's first 13 tests, he actually won fewer tests than Ross Taylor - Taylor won 4 tests out of 13 and McCullum 3 out of 13.
MCCullum record as captain in his first 14 tests is as follows:
It took 11 tests for McCullum to notch up his first win - against one of the weakest West Indies sides to ever tour New Zealand.
In the second test of the series McCullum scored the first test triple century by a NZer (302). James Neesham scored 137* on his test debut and NZ's second innings score was their highest ever - 680/8 declared. The test was drawn and NZ won the series 1-0.
McCullum's triple century capped off the best home summer in a generation. NZ won 3 tests and drew 2. McCullum silenced his many critics  In the five tests, Taylor averaged 134.75, McCullum 88.25 and Williamson 47.73. Boult took 30 wickets  at 19.2; Southee 29 at 20.27; and Wagner 19 at 33.3.
