Racing career

1996: two-year-old season

Bint Allayl made her debut in a five-furlong maiden race at York in May. Ridden by Frankie Dettori, she reportedly had "every chance" but was beaten a neck by Pipalong,
She was then moved up to Group Three class for the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot where she was again matched against Pipalong. She had already been described in the press as "arguably the season's fastest two-year-old",
It was more than two months before Bint Allayl appeared for her final start, the Lowther Stakes at York, although she was reported to be working impressively at home.

Death

Despite a strong belief in the press that Bint Allayl would join the Godolphin Racing team, her owner decided to keep the filly in England with Mick Channon. During the winter, she required surgery on an injured hock but appeared to have fully recovered. On 24 February 1999, Bint Allayl was injured when cantering during light exercise at West Ilsley. She received emergency veterinary treatment, but examinations revealed that she had suffered an untreatable "spiral fracture of her left-fore humerus". She was euthanized that evening.
