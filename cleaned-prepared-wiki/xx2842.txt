Languages

There are 90 individual languages of Ethiopia according to Ethnologue,Ethnologue page on Ethiopian languages with the 1994 Ethiopian census indicating that some 77 tongues were spoken locally. Most of these languages belong to the Afro-Asiatic family (Semitic and Cushitic). Omotic languages are also spoken, though their classification is uncertain. Additionally, Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by the nation's Nilotic ethnic minorities.

English is the most widely spoken foreign language and is taught in all secondary schools.

Vital statistics

Registration of vital events in Ethiopia is incomplete. The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates:

CBR = crude birth rate (per 1,000); CDR = crude death rate (per 1,000); NC = natural change (per 1,000); IMR = infant mortality rate per 1,000 births; TFR = total fertility rate (number of children per woman)

Total Fertility rate in Ethiopia

According to 2011 official survey, total fertility rate was 4.8 with 2.6 in Urban and 5.5 in rural regions.com/pubs/pdf/FR255/FR255.pdf
Total wanted fertility rate (TWFR) in Ethiopia is 3.0 children per woman, this suggests that the TFR is 60 percent 
higher than it would be if unwanted births were avoided.com/pubs/pdf/FR255/FR255.pdf
