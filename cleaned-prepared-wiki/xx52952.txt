History

Formation

ANA's earliest ancestor was  Nippon Helicopter was the source of what would later be ANA's IATA airline code, NH.
NH began helicopter services in February 1953. On 15 December 1953, it operated its first cargo flight between Osaka and Tokyo using a de Havilland Dove, JA5008. This was the first scheduled flight flown by a Japanese pilot in postwar Japan. Passenger service on the same route began on 1 February 1954, and was upgraded to a de Havilland Heron in March. In 1955, the Douglas DC-3 plane began flying for NH as well, by which time the airline's route network extended from northern Kyūshū to Sapporo.
ANA's other ancestor was . Although it was founded on 26 December 1952, one day before NH, it did not begin operations until 20 January 1954, when it began night cargo runs between Osaka and Tokyo, also using a de Havilland Dove. It adopted the DC-3 in early 1957, by which point its route network extended through southern Japan from Tokyo to Kagoshima.
FEA merged with NH in March 1958. The combined companies had a total market capitalization of 600 million yen, and was Japan's largest private airline.  The merged airline, called All Nippon Airways, received a new Japanese name (全日本空輸 Zen Nippon Kūyu; Japan Air Transport). The company logo of the larger NH was selected as the logo of the new combined airline, and the new carrier operated a route network combined from its two predecessors.

Domestic era

ANA grew through the 1960s, adding the Vickers Viscount to the fleet in 1960 and the Fokker F27 in 1961. October 1961 marked ANA's debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as well as the Osaka Securities Exchange.  1963 saw another merger, with Fujita Airlines, raising the company's capital to 4.65 billion yen.  In 1965 ANA introduced jets with Boeing 727s on the Tokyo-Sapporo route. It also introduced Japan's first homegrown turboprop airliner, the YS-11 in 1965, replacing Convair 440s on local routes. In 1969, ANA introduced Boeing 737 service.
As ANA grew it started to contract travel companies across Japan to handle ground services in each region.   Many of these companies received shares in ANA as part of their deals. Some of these relationships continue today in different forms: for instance, Nagoya Railroad, which handled ANA's operations in the Chūbu region along with other partnerships, By 1974, ANA had Japan's largest domestic airline network.
While ANA's domestic operations grew, the Ministry of Transportation had granted government-owned Japan Airlines (JAL) a monopoly on international scheduled flights that lasted until 1986. ANA was allowed to operate international charter flights: its first was a 727 charter from Tokyo to Hong Kong on February 21, 1971.
ANA bought its first widebody aircraft, six Lockheed L-1011s, in November 1971, following a lengthy sales effort by Lockheed which had involved negotiations between US president Richard Nixon, Japanese premier Kakuei Tanaka and UK premier Edward Heath (lobbying in favor of engine maker Rolls-Royce). Tanaka also pressed Japanese regulators to permit ANA to operate on Asia routes as part of the package.
Boeing 747-200s were introduced on the Tokyo-Sapporo and Tokyo-Fukuoka routes in 1976 and Boeing 767s in 1983 on Shikoku routes. The carrier's first 747s were the short-range SR variant, designed for Japanese domestic routes.

International era

In 1986, ANA began to expand beyond Japan's key domestic carrier to become a competitive international carrier as well. On 3 March 1986, ANA started scheduled international flights with a passenger service from Tokyo to Guam.'The History of ANA's 20 years of international flight Service', ANA Sky Web (June 2006). Retrieved 2 September 2006. Flights to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. followed by year's end, and ANA also entered a service agreement with American Airlines to feed the US carrier's new flights to Narita.
ANA expanded its international services gradually: to Beijing, Dalian, Hong Kong and Sydney in 1987; to Seoul in 1988; to London and Saipan in 1989; to Paris in 1990 and to New York in 1991.
2004 saw ANA's profits exceed JAL's for the first time. That year, facing a surplus of slots due to the construction of new airports and the ongoing expansion of Tokyo International Airport, ANA announced a fleet renewal plan that would replace some of its large aircraft with a greater number of smaller aircraft.
Also in 2004, ANA set up low-cost subsidiary Air Next to operate flights from Fukuoka Airport starting in 2005, and became the majority shareholder in Nakanihon Airline Service (NAL) headquartered in Nagoya Airport.
. Air Central (in Japanese) browsed 2008-01-21. On July 12, 2005, ANA reached a deal with NYK to sell its 27.6% share in Nippon Cargo Airlines, a joint venture formed between the two companies in 1987.[ref]ANA to Sell Share in Nippon Cargo Airlines to NYK
All Nippon Airways official website browsed 21 January 2008[/ref] The sale allowed ANA to focus on developing its own cargo division. In 2006, ANA, Japan Post, Nippon Express, and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines founded ANA & JP Express (AJV), which would operate freighters. ANA is the top shareholder of AJV. It absorbed Air Japan's freighter operations.
Air Transport World named ANA its 2007 "Airline of the Year." In 2006, the airline was recognized by FlightOnTime.[ref]
[/ref] Japan Airlines took over the title in 2007. In 2009, ANA announced plans to test an idea as part of the airline's "e-flight" campaign, encouraging passengers on select flights to visit the airport restroom before they board.
July 2011, All Nippon Airways and AirAsia have agreed to form a low-cost carrier AirAsia Japan based in Tokyo's Narita International Airport. ANA will hold 51 percent shares and AirAsia will hold 33 percent voting shares and 16 percent non-voting shares through its wholly owned subsidiary, AA International.

Fleet history

Originally, there was more than one YS-11 in the All Nippon Airways fleet, although most of the YS-11's were used under the name of ANK, or Air Nippon, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways.  The final YS-11 in operation was retired in 2006. A number of YS-11's are in museums, or otherwise scrapped or taken apart. After a final retirement process through September 2006, all YS-11's were downed, obligated to retire, unless privately owned and were privately renovated. The YS-11 was a big part of All Nippon Airways back in the 1970s to the early 1990s, when it was used as a domestic carrier throughout the Japanese industry of flight.
ANA flew their last flight of their Airbus A321 on February 29, 2008, which was flight 864 from Hakodate to Tokyo Haneda, arriving at Haneda at 20:25 (8:25 p.m.). This marked the end of almost 10 years of operation of the Airbus A321, in which ANA was the first and the only customer in the country of Japan to operate this kind of aircraft.

Fleet plans

ANA is the launch customer for the new Boeing widebody, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, ordering 50 examples with an option for 50 more during April 2004. Deliveries began in late 2011 when ANA received its first Dreamliner on 21 September 2011, the first ever Dreamliner to be delivered in the world. ANA split the order between 30 of the short-range 787-3 and 20 of the long haul 787-8, and during October 2004 announced it had selected Rolls-Royce to supply the engines. However, ANA later converted their -3 orders to the -8 variant. The aircraft will allow new routes to be opened to mid-sized cities not previously served, such as Barcelona, Boston, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Charlotte, Düsseldorf, Denver, Madrid, Miami and Montreal. It plans to receive 20 787s by March 2013, and plans to receive all 55 aircraft by March 2018.
On 17 February 2005, ANA signed a contract for an additional four Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, bringing the order total for that model to ten, the first of which was delivered in October 2004. Seven 777-300s (all of which were delivered), sixteen 777-200s (all delivered), and seven 777-200ERs (all delivered) by 2009. ANA announced on March 6, 2007 that it had ordered 4 Boeing 777-300ER aircraft as part of its continued fleet expansion.
ANA announced on 31 January 2006 that it would be converting two of its previously ordered 737-700s to 737-700ERs, thus becoming the launch customer of this longest-range version of the 737. ANA was also the launch customer of Japan's newest jet since the NAMC YS-11, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet. The airline ordered 15 MRJ90 aircraft with an option for an additional 10 on March 27, 2008.
The airline has contracted for three A320s and also leased two others[ref]
[/ref] as a temporary measure until their 737-700 deliveries are complete. Thereafter, A320s will be withdrawn for domestic service but will remain in the fleet. ANA reportedly considered purchasing 5 Airbus A380's according to Nikkei Business Daily. As surging fuel prices pressured airlines, ANA's fuel-saving options included possibly using the A380, which can carry more passengers on fewer flights; delays in the delivery of Boeing 787 also led ANA to consider purchasing A380s. However, this plan has been postponed amid low passenger demand.
On 21 December 2009, ANA announced plans to buy 10 new wide-body aircraft from Boeing. The order consists of 5 Boeing 767 aircraft, and 5 Boeing 777 aircraft. The 767s are to be used as stop gap until the completion of ANA's order for 787s, while 777s will be used to replace the airline's fleet of Boeing 747-400 aircraft, which are due to be sold in 2010 to an as yet unnamed buyer.2 billion deal

New cabin

Introduced in 2009, the "Inspiration of Japan" cabin features included fully-lie-flat-bed business class seats (the first for a Japanese airline. ANA will also introduce a new lounge (which opened on February 20, 2010, supposed to be in coincidence with the introduction of new aircraft interiors but delayed below) and check-in concept (later in autumn 2010) at Narita for first class and ANA Mileage Club's Diamond Service elite members.
The introduction of the concept also discontinued the use of the name "Club ANA", which was used for its international business class seats (changing into a generic business class name) as well as the name of the lounges (all lounges for both first class and business class are named "ANA Lounge", with the first class lounge called the "ANA Suite Lounge" and its arrival lounge the "ANA Arrival Lounge").
This "Inspiration of Japan" concept was originally set to debut on February 20, 2010 with the delivery of its new Boeing 777-300ER prior to that date, followed by the introduction of the concept on that date on the Narita-New York route. However, due to delays to the new premium economy seats, the debut was pushed back to April 19. (The delay was due to the failure of a safety test in Japan of a new seat design axle, made by seat manufacturer Koito Industries Ltd. This safety test failure also affected deliveries of aircraft to be operated by three other fellow Star Alliance members - Singapore Airlines for its A380s, Thai Airways' A330s, and Continental Airlines for new 737-800 deliveries.Singapore Air A380 Delivery Delayed on Lack of Seats)
The "Inspiration of Japan" concept has been refitted on its existing 777-300ERs for service on all the airline's North American routes, Delay in Flight Commencement of the New Boeing 777-300ER Aircraft and Change of Launch Date for New Brand and Service
