Recording

Garbage began writing their second album, which would go under the working title of Sad Alcoholic Clowns, in March 1997 in the band's label-head Jerry Moss' Friday Harbor, Washington, vacation house. The group demoed and made rough outlines for new songs. When they felt they had made a good start, Garbage took the work they made in Washington back to their Madison, Wisconsin base at Smart Studios and begin fleshing out the ideas and rough sketches over the following year. The group recorded all of their work for the second album through a 48-track digital system digitally, direct to hard drives utilizing a 24bit Pro Tools rig.
Much of the percussion was recorded in a disused candy factory located in Madison; Butch Vig, Marker and sound engineer Billy Bush set up a drum kit within the factory and recorded various fills, utilising the acoustics of the dilapidated building. Forced to stop after local police officers responded to complaints about the noise, some of the percussion was later incorporated into "Temptation Waits", "I Think I'm Paranoid" and "Hammering in My Head".0", by Greg Rule, published August 1999 issue.
Garbage completed recording, producing and mixing of their second album in mid-February 1998, and the album was given the title Version 2.0.

Composition

Building on framework sound and style Garbage established on their debut set, Version 2.0 featured musical references to the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, songs featuring live strings, over 100 recorded tracks and interpolations of both the Beach Boys and The Pretenders."Version 2.0 press release" (Retrieved - 2007-12-10) The band claimed that the goal of Version 2.0 was to create a rapprochement between the "high-tech and low-down, the now sound and of golden memories". Manson declared that "we didn't want to totally embrace the world of electronica", so Version 2.0 was a juxtaposition of "the super-hi-fi with the super-organic", echoing bands they like "and that means not just Bj√∂rk and Portishead and Radiohead but the Beatles and Beach Boys and Frank Sinatra".
The lyrics, according to Manson, "tried to let the darker undercurrents come through to offset some of the pop melodies", adding that "like human people, songs shouldn't be one-dimensional". The singer declared that the introspective nature of Version 2.0 served to "reassure myself while I'm going crazy" due to her experiences during production, as she was "living by myself in a hotel, and I had no one to really talk to" and every day coming back by herself really late after working on the studio.Garbage New System Upgrade, CMJ New Music Monthly
