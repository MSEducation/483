The institute was founded by papal decree of Pope Pius XII in June 1942. Its assets are not the property of the Holy See, and therefore it is outside the jurisdiction of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See. 2The Annuario Pontificio lists it under neither "Holy See" nor "Vatican City State", placing it among charitable foundations.

Origin and mission

The Istituto per le Opere di Religione (IOR) was founded on 27 June 1942 by Pope Pius XII. It absorbed the Amministrazione per le Opere di Religione (Administration of the Works of Religion), which had originated in the Commission for Works of Charity (Commissione ad pias causas) established by Pope Leo XIII on 11 February 1887. 1908
The purpose of the IOR is "to provide for the safekeeping and administration of movable and immovable property transferred or entrusted to it by physical or juridical persons and intended for works of religion or charity". 
The Institute does not use deposits to lend money and does not issue securities for resale or other financial products.Vatican Bank Discloses Annual Earnings Report for First Time, Bloomberg, 1 October 2013 In 2014, the Vatican officially confirmed the IOR's mission as provider of "specialized financial services to the Catholic Church worldwide." Furthermore, it was affirmed by the Vatican that the "valuable services that can be offered by the Institute assist the Holy Father in his mission as universal pastor and also aid those institutions and individuals who collaborate with him in his ministry". 
The IOR is not a department of the Roman Curia, the central administrative structure of the Roman Catholic Church.This central banking function of the Vatican is regulated by the Monetary Agreement between the European Union and the Vatican City State, Monetary Agreement between the European Union and the Vatican City State authorizing the use of the euro as the official currency of Vatican City. Implementation of that Agreement and oversight of the Vatican law against money laundering and financing of terrorism is in the hands of the Financial Information Authority established by Pope Benedict XVI on 30 December 2010. Motu proprio for the prevention and countering of illegal activities in the area of financial dealings, Pope requires full transparency of transactions in the Vatican With the creation of the "Secretariat for the Economy" on 24 February 2014, the APSA's role as the central bank of the Vatican was consolidated.vatican.va: PRESS RELEASE: NEW COORDINATION STRUCTURE FOR ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE AFFAIRS OF THE HOLY SEE AND THE VATICAN STATE, 24 February 2014

Controversies

Historical allegations

When the Holy See, whose tax-exempt status on income from Italian investments was revoked in 1968, decided to diversify its holdings, it employed as financial advisor Michele Sindona. The 1974 failure of Sindona's Franklin National Bank and the subsequent collapse of his financial empire, into which he had chanelled part of the Holy See's investments, entailed losses for the Vatican estimated by one source at 35 billion Italian lire (20 million pounds sterling). 252Nicolas Pileggi, "The Tycoon Vanishes" in New York Magazine, 24 September 1979, p. 44Mark Lombardi, Robert Carleton Hobbs, Judith Richards, Global Networks (published by Independent Curators in 2003 for a travelling exhibition of the work of artist Mark Lombardi, ISBN 0-916365-67-0), pp. 61-65]The Banker, vol. 125, issues 587-592, p. 228
In 1982, a major political and financial scandal connected with the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano involved the head of IOR from 1971 to 1989, Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, who allegedly had given "letters of patronage" on behalf of the IOR in support of the failed bank. Marcinkus evaded arrest by staying inside Vatican City until the warrant was dismissed in 1991, whereupon he returned to his home country, the United States.

Several books published during the 1980s and 1990s were highly critical of the Institute for the Works of Religion's historical relations with anti-communist governments. ??
Alperin v. Vatican Bank is a class action suit by Holocaust survivors against the Institute for the Works of Religion and Franciscan Order ("Order of Friars Minor") filed in San Francisco, California on 15 November 1999. The case was dismissed as a political question by the District Court for the Northern District of California in 2003, but reinstated in part by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2005. That ruling has attracted attention as a precedent at the intersection of the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) and the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). The complaint against the Vatican Bank was dismissed in 2007 on the basis of sovereign immunity, but the case against the Franciscan Order continues as of 2009. According to one analysis, "the case is extremely complicated and potentially massive, considering the large class spread across many countries". 2006.

Judicial events and reorganisation (2010–2014)

In September 2010, Italian magistrates seized €23 million from the IOR, on the grounds that the anti-money laundering laws in force had been violated. The money was originally to be transferred from the Italian Credito Artigiano to JP Morgan Chase and another Italian bank, Banca del Fucino. It was furthermore declared that Gotti Tedeschi and another IOR manager were under investigation for money laundering charges.
On 24 May 2012, Ettore Gotti Tedeschi was ousted as Head of the Vatican Bank because of his alleged "failure to fulfill the primary functions of his office".Italian prosecutors drop inquiry into former Vatican bank chief, Reuters, 6 July 2013 In March 2014, he was again acquitted by the Roman court that followed the public prosecutor's position and relieved Gotti Tedeschi from any responsibility in that operation.Vatican Insider: Gotti Tedeschi's counter attack, 28 March 2013Daily Mail: Vatican bank's ousted president comes out swinging, 28 March 2014
On 30 December 2010, Pope Benedict XVI established the Vatican's independent Financial Intelligence Authority (Autorità di Informazione Finanziaria, AIF) to oversee the monetary and commercial activities of all Vatican-related institutions, including the IOR. The Vatican's so-called "financial watchdog" monitors all Vatican financial operations and ensures they meet international norms against money-laundering and the financing of terrorism.The Vatican Creates a Financial Watchdog, The New York Times, 30 December 2013
