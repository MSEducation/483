CATEGORIES: 2011 National Football League season by team, NFC West championship seasons, San Francisco 49ers seasons

The 2011 San Francisco 49ers season was the franchise's 66th season overall, and 62nd in the National Football League (NFL). It is the first season under head coach Jim Harbaugh and general manager Trent Baalke. The 49ers rebounded from their disappointing 2010 season to end their streak of eight consecutive non-winning seasons. After defeating the St. Louis Rams in week 13 and attaining a 10–2 record, the team clinched the NFC West and made their first playoff appearance since 2002. The 49ers ended the regular season with a 13–3 record, their best since 1997 and earned a bye in the first round of the playoffs. In the Divisional Playoffs they defeated the New Orleans Saints 36–32 and were in the NFC Championship for the first time since 1997 where they lost against the New York Giants 20–17 in overtime, coming just short of returning to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1994. Despite their most successful season in years, the 49ers were 31st in the league in third down conversion percentage in the regular season (29.1) and were 17.9 percent in the playoffs.

Offseason

Coaching changes

Owner Jed York announced that he would hire a general manager and the new GM would make a decision on the new head coach to replace Mike Singletary after the 49ers loss to the St. Louis Rams on December 26, 2010 that eliminated the team from the postseason.  On January 7, the 49ers hired Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh to be the 18th head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.
With the hiring of a new head coach, many of the assistant coaches were replaced.  Out of the coordinators and position coaches from last season, only running backs coach Tom Rathman, defensive line coach Jim Tomsula, and offensive line coach Mike Solari were retained.  The coaching staff features Greg Roman as the new offensive coordinator and Vic Fangio as the new defensive coordinator, both previously assistant coaches under Harbaugh at Stanford. Former Cleveland Browns assistant head coach and special teams coordinator Brad Seely was hired for the same roles with the 49ers. Geep Chryst is the new quarterbacks coach, Reggie Davis is the new tight ends coach. John Morton is the new wide receivers coach, and Tim Drevno is a new offensive line coach to help out Mike Solari. Jim Leavitt is the new linebackers coach and Ed Donatell is the new secondary coach. The staff also features defensive assistants Peter Hansen and Ehiro Evero, offensive assistant Bobby Engram, and special assistant to the head coach Bill Nayes.

Candlestick Park incident

On the night of Saturday, August 20, 2011, according to a copyrighted online article appearing in the headlines of the Sunday, August 21, 2011 online edition of the AOL Huffington Post Sports News page: "A man wearing a shirt slamming the San Francisco 49ers was seriously wounded as gunfire erupted in the parking lot after the team's NFL preseason game, while another man sustained lesser injuries in an earlier shooting, police said. The violence occurred after the 49ers' 17–3 victory Saturday night over the Oakland Raiders at Candlestick Park, police Sgt. Michael Andraychak said. A 24-year-old man was treated at San Francisco General Hospital for life-threatening injuries, and a 20-year-old man was hospitalized with less serious wounds, Andraychack told the Associated Press. Their names were not released. The violence comes months after a San Francisco Giants' fan was severely beaten by two men in Los Angeles Dodgers' gear outside Dodger Stadium, after the teams' season opener March 31. Two suspects have been charged in the case."
The NFL has officially canceled all future preseason games between the two teams.

Game summaries

=NFC Divisional Playoffs: vs. #3 New Orleans Saints=

Alex Smith's 14-yard touchdown pass to tight end Vernon Davis with 9 seconds left gave San Francisco their first playoff win since 2002 at the end of a wild, back and forth final quarter which featured four lead changes in a span of 3:53. Davis' game winning touchdown catch occurred four days after the 30th anniversary of The Catch – Joe Montana's famous touchdown pass to Dwight Clark – known as one of the most famous plays in San Francisco 49ers history. Sports writers and 49ers fans have taken to referring Davis' catch as The Catch III. With the win, the 49ers improved to 14–3 and faced the New York Giants at Candlestick Park in the NFC Championship Game.

=NFC Championship: vs. #4 New York Giants=

In a defensive game, the New York Giants won in overtime on a 31 yard field goal by Lawrence Tynes. Kyle Williams, a rookie, took over punt return duties for an injured Ted Ginn, Jr. and had what many 49ers fans consider the worst playoff performance in team history. Williams fumbled three times, losing two of them, that led to 10 Giants points, including setting up the game winning field goal. He also dove for a punt, instead of just letting it go. The 49ers' offense also struggled to move the ball at times throughout the game. They did not convert a 3rd down conversion for the first three quarters. With the loss, the 49ers season ends with a 14-4 record.
