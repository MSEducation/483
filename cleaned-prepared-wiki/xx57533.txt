History

Standiford Field was built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1941 on a parcel of land south of Louisville that was found not to have flooded during the Ohio River flood of 1937.  It was named for Dr. Elisha David Standiford, a local businessman and politician, who was active in transportation issues and owned part of the land.  The field remained under Army control until 1947, when it was turned over to the Louisville Air Board for commercial operations.
Until around 1947 Bowman Field was Louisville's main airport.  For many years passenger traffic went through the small brick Lee Terminal at Standiford Field.  Today's more modern and much larger facilities were built in the 1980s.  Most of the Lee Terminal was later torn down.
The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 45 weekday departures on Eastern Airlines, 19 American, 9 TWA, 4 Piedmont and 2 Ozark. Scheduled jet flights (Eastern 720s to Idlewild) began in January–February 1962.  Parallel runways, needed for expanded UPS operations, were part of an airport expansion plan begun in the 1980s.

In 1970 the terminal again expanded; the main lobby was extended and the 
The 1980s brought plans for a new terminal, the Louisville Airport Improvement plan (LAIP). Construction of a new landside terminal designed by Bickel-Gibson Associated Architects Inc. began, costing $35 million with capacity for nearly 2 million passengers in 1985.

The facility is currently the size of 80 football fields and capable of handling 115 packages a second, or 416,000 per hour. The facility mainly handles express and international packages and letters. Worldport serves all major domestic and international hubs.
