Ullevi (sometimes given as Nya Ullevi: New Ullevi) is a multi-purpose stadium in Gothenburg, Sweden.

IFK Göteborg has also played two UEFA Cup finals at the stadium, in 1982 and 1987, but then as home game in a home and away final. The stadium hosted several events, like football, ice hockey, boxing, racing, athletics and concerts.
The stadium is one of the biggest in the Nordic countries, with a seating capacity of 43,000 and a total capacity of 75,000 for concerts.

The 2004 UEFA Cup Final was held at the stadium on 19 May of that year. Valencia of Spain defeated Marseille of France 2-0.

Music

Ullevi nearly collapsed during a famous Bruce Springsteen concert on 8 June 1985, due to the rhythmic movement of tens of thousands of people in the audience and the clay soil which the stadium is built. The concert also caused nearly £3 million in damages, while David Bowie's Glass Spider Tour in June 1987 was relocated from Ullevi to Eriksberg because of fears about the safety of the structure. Since then, the concrete pillars supporting the stadium have been extended down to the bedrock. Springsteen has performed at the stadium on subsequent tours. 
Elton John hosted a sell-out concert in 1998. It was part of the Face-To-Face Tour with Billy Joel, but Joel was unable to perform, due to illness. Elton John played for over three hours.
The "big four" of thrash metal (Slayer, Anthrax, Megadeth, and Metallica) played in the stadium on 3 July 2011. The concert was broadcast all around the world.

Innovation

Since March 2007, Ullevi has one of Sweden's largest solar power plants, consisting of 600m² of solar photovoltaic panels situated on the roof of the luxury boxes section. The top effect is 86.4 kW and the yield is supposed to cover the total power used by the artificial lighting used for events, with a surplus.

Speedway

Ullevi has also hosted Motorcycle speedway and hosted the Speedway World Championship on no less than eight occasions, second only to Wembley Stadium in London, England which hosted the World Final a record 26 times. The track is a dirt surface laid out over the athletics track and is officially 404m long with a track record of 69.4 seconds (4 laps clutch start).speedwayworld.
Since the World Championship was changed in 1995 from a single meeting Final to the Speedway Grand Prix (SGP), Ullevi has hosted a round of the series in 2002, 2003, 2004 (Grand Prix of Scandinavia), 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 (Grand Prix of Sweden).
