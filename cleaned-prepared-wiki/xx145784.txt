Fairy Meadows, named by German climbers (German Märchenwiese, ″fairy tale meadows″)

Location

Fairy Meadows is approachable by a twelve kilometer-long jeepable trek starting from Raikhot bridge on Karakoram Highway to the village Tato.

Tourism

The six-month tourist season at Fairy Meadows starts in April and continues until the end of September. Tourists lodge at the camping site spread over two acres, known as "Raikot Serai". The site of Fairy Meadows, though partially developed, generates about PKR 17 million revenue from tourism, mainly by providing food, transportation and accommodation services. A project by Shangri La Resorts of establishing a hotel at the resort was cancelled after it was declared a National Park. The local community stopped the extraction of timber to conserve the forest and promote tourism in the area.

Flora and fauna

The grassland is surrounded by thick alpine forest.
Among mammals, a few brown bears are found in the region, with their numbers declining.
