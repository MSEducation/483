Oviedo (in Asturian language Uviéu) is the capital city of the Principality of Asturias in northern Spain and the administrative and commercial centre of the region. It is also the name of the municipality that contains the city. The city lends its name to the sudarium of Oviedo a religious relic revered there since the 9th century.

History

The Kingdom of Asturias began in 720, with a Visigothic Aristocrat Pelagius`s (685-737) revolt against the Muslims occupying most of Spain at the time. The Arab invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 took control of most of the peninsula until the revolt in the northern mountains by Pelagius. The resulting Kingdom of Asturias, located in an economically poor region of the peninsula, was largely ignored by the Muslims. In 720, the area where Oviedo was located was still uninhabited. History and the historians of medieval Spain. Clarendon Press, 1993, p.83-4.
It is said that two monks, Nolan and John, founded the city in 761. That settlement was soon to be completed with the construction of a small church dedicated to Saint Vincent. Oviedo was established on an uninhabited hillside, with no Visigothic or Roman foundation before it became an Asturian city.83-4  Following Pelagius, who died in 737, Alfonso I (739-57) founded a dynasty that would last until 1037. The Asturian Kingdom was on hostile terms with southern Arab Spain. In 794, Oviedo was sacked by Caliph Hisham I in one of his numerous campaigns against the Christian kingdoms.M. Dunlop, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. B. Lewis, V.L. Menage, C. Pellat and J. Schacht, (E.J. Brill, 1986), 495.
King Alfonso I is said to have "set in place the whole order of the Goths, as it had been in Toledo, as much in the church as in the palace."Chronica Albeldensia. XV. 9: ed. Gil, Crónicas asturianas, p. 174.  The intention with Oviedo was to shape it into a city similar to that of Visigothic Toledo. Once kings had settled in Oviedo, they adopted as much of the architectural style and imagery of Toledo. Even with this in mind, Oviedo did not necessarily resemble the old Visigothic capital in Toledo. The churches and buildings of Oviedo follow instead late provincial Roman tradition. Since Asturias at the time was an agriculturally poor area of Spain the scale of the buildings is quite impressive.The Inheritance of Rome. Penguin Books, 2009, p. 500-3
Oviedo's rich architectural tradition began with King Fruela I (757-768). King Fruela I of Asturias, the fourth of the Asturian monarchs, was the first decided promoter of the city as may be witnessed by his construction of both a palace and a nearby church. This church was later restored by Alfonso II. Oviedo owes to a later king, Alfonso II The Chaste (791-842), its establishment as a capital city and ruling seat as a result of the moving of the court from Pravia and the creation of the Pilgrim's Route to Santiago de Compostela, a major event in the history of Oviedo, a church dedicated to The Saviour, the Cathedral of San Salvador, and a royal palace formed the nucleus of Oviedo. Also constructed during Alfonso II`s reign was the San Julian de los Prados church, which is one of best preserved Asturian churches. Alfonso II`s successor, Ramiro I (842-850), continued Alfonso II`s construction streak. Ramiro I constructed two buildings, the Church Santa Maria de Naranco and San Miguel de Lillo. The Church Santa Maria de Naranjo was likely to originally be Ramiro I`s palace and later changed into a church. Caliphs and Kings: Spain, 796-1031. Wiley-Blackwell, 2012, p.109  By this time the Court of the Palace was centered in Oviedo, which was the main royal residence. This court was controlled by member of the Austurian nobility.71
Ramiro I`s (842-850) eight year tenure was uneasy, he faced rebellions from the Counts of the Palace. The first rebellion against Ramiro I was led by Alroitus, and the second rebellion was led by Piniolus. Both of these rebellions were unsuccessful in removing Ramiro I. These rebellions may have been why Ramiro I built his palace in the mountains surrounding Oviedo, presumably away from the violence.  During the 9th century in Oviedo, Roman style property law is common. 9th century documents also indicate small scale aristocracies across the kingdom, as well as a large presence of a landowning peasantry.500-3
Following Ramiro I`s reign, Ordoño I (850-866) came into power and began the Asturian king's father-son succession. Ordoño I was the first king to push southwards into Arab territory.  Following Ordoño I`s death on May 27, 866, usurpers attempted to take the throne. The following king Alfonso III (866-910), who was thirteen at the time, took refuge in Castile until his followers had killed the usurper.78
Alfonso III`s contributions to building construction are not nearly as well documented as Ramiro I`s or Alfonso II`s contributions. The Chronicle of Alfonso III does not mention any buildings created by Alfonso III, neither does the Chronicle of Albelda. In 882, the body of the Cordoban martyr Eulogius was sent to Oviedo. This was meant a diplomatic gift from Emir Muhammad I (852-886). Eulogius was executed in 859. The body was likely accompanied by Eulogius`s book collection.  In the 16th century, the only manuscript of Eulogius`s writings was discovered in the Oviedo Cathedral Library. Here it was copied once before it disappeared completely from the library. Following an offensive in 881 against an Umayyad army, Alfsonso III returned to Oviedo to rebuild churches. It was at this time he constructed one or more palaces.  The Chronicle of Albelda and the Chronicle of Sampiro tie Alfonso III`s victories in battle to his program of church building in Oviedo.81  In 908, Alfonso III commissioned a gold and jewelled cross to contain the cross carried by Pelagius I at Corvodonga. This "Cross of Victory" is located in the Camara Sancta in the Oviedo Cathedral. However, recent Carbon14 analysis of the wooden cross indicates that it was no older than the golden casing created to surround the cross. The commission of the casing shows us Alfonso III's interest in perpetuating the legend of Pelagius I. Fabrication it seems, is a running tradition in Oviedo. Bishop Pelayo de Oviedo "el fabulador," or the storyteller made many fabrications during the 12th century.
Towards the end of Alfonso III`s reign, he faced many challenges. In 901, a prophet named Alhaman led a "great army of Arabs" and attempted to take Zamora. To add to this, Alfonso III`s brother Vermudo revolted in Astorga. There were several attempts at the aging Alfonso III`s life by his sons. Alfonso III was overthrown by sons, and died in Zamora. His body was taken to Oviedo for burial.
The moving of the royal court to León, after the death of Alfonso III, 'The Great', links the life of the city to the relics preserved in its cathedral and the passing of pilgrims that visit El Salvador, and continue on their way to Santiago de Compostela. Kings spent less and less time in Oviedo following the change, and spent more time in the rich Duero Plains. León was built up after it became the capital, and eventually surpassed Oviedo in terms of construction.
During the 12th century, many Royal Charters were fabricated by Bishop Pelayo de Oviedo. Since were few checks on internal bookkeeping in the Asturian kingdom actions like this were commonplace in the kingdom. When original documents faded, they were copied onto cartularies and often with alterations that suited the needs of those who copied the documents. The most glaring example can be seen in the Liber Testamentorum, which was compiled by Bishop Pelayo de Oviedo in 1109. This document contained many confirmation rights and property rights of the Oviedo cathedral by Asturian and Leonese Kings. Bishop Pelayo's intent behind this was to try to gain the independence of his see from the archbishop of Toledo or Santiago, as well as to promote Oviedo as a pilgrim destination.51  According to Sánchez-Albornoz, "He (Bishop Pelayo) always, always, always falsified."'Siempre, siempre, siempre falsificó al service de las Gloria de su iglesia': Hist. de España Espasa calpe, vii. I. p.589  It is assumed that Bishop Pelayo never committed forgery for the enjoyment, but primarily to promote the church of Oviedo.78-9
The following centuries (12th-16th) witness the development of the medieval city, the outlines of which are still preserved today, the construction of the city walls, a devastating fire which took place on Christmas Eve in 1521, and the aqueduct works, Los Pilares, constructed in order to provide the city with water throughout the 16th century.
The foundation of the Arts College (University of Oviedo) by Fernando de Valdés Salas, at the beginning of the 17th century, opened Oviedo to a progressive urban expansion. Further impulse was in the 18th century by the regional nobility and the construction of remarkable palaces; in the 19th century by industrial growth and the suburban development of Uría Street; and finally in the 20th century by administrative and commercial development.
In October 1934 there was a left-wing revolt against the conservative government, based in several cities.  In Asturias the fighting developed into a small, short-lived civil war.  50,000 workers, mostly miners, armed themselves  with dynamite and captured Oviedo after heavy fighting.  They gained control of the arsenal with 30,000 rifles and machine guns.  The Army Chief of Staff, General Francisco Franco sent in soldiers who overpowered the rebels after severe street fighting that left 3000 rebels dead and 7000 wounded.  The cathedral was badly damaged, with its eighth-century chapel blown up by a mine.  In the aftermath many false atrocity stories circulated. 1950) pp 285-87
The Siege of Oviedo in 1936 was a memorable event in the Spanish Civil War. The army garrison rose in support of the coup d'état and stood a siege of three months by an improvised force, loyal to the Republican government until relieved in 1937.

Economy

The economy is strongly dependant on the tertiary sector, with many office buildings in the city centre. Oviedo's status as the administrative centre of the region supports a large number of jobs in public administration. The manufacturing sector, which remains important in this part of Spain, is not much in evidence in Oviedo itself, but is more important in the adjacent municipalities of Siero and Llanera which lie to the north of the city, between Oviedo and Gijon.  In 2009 the Oviedo municipality had a total debt of €135,185,000.00.

Architecture

Oviedo contains a very rich architectural history, with many buildings dating back to the early medieval period. Many of the building projects were untaken during Alfonso II`s (791-842) reign and Ramiro I`s (842-850) reign. Alfonso III`s contributions are not as well documented.
Alfonso II is said to have built four churches, one dedicated to Christ the Saviour, the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Tyrsus, and SS Julian and Basilissa. There are few traces of the churches dedicated to the Saviour, the Virgin Mary, and St. Tyrsus. The San Salvadore church, which was dedicated to the Saviour, is likely beneath the Cathedral of Oviedo. The church of Santa Maria de la Corte, which was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was demolished in 1702.109  As for St. Tyrsus, the church dedicated to him exists today as the church of San Tirso. Only a wall and a three light window are believed to have been built by Alfonso II, the majority of the rest of the church is dated to the 14th century. Spain: an Oxford archaeological guide. Oxford University Press, 1998, p.217-219 The best preserved church constructed during Alfonso II`s time was San Julian de los Prados.
Two buildings are said to have been built during Ramiro I`s reign, one was a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary and the other construction was a palace. These were built just outside of Oviedo, on Monte Lignum. The church Santa Maria de Naranco seems to originally have been a palace, but later repurposed into a church. The church has an atypical plan from other churches at its time, possibly because it was supposed to contain a throne room for the king. The other church built during Ramiro I`s time was San Miguel de Lillo.
The Chronicle of Albelda, one of the primary sources used to discern which King commissioned which building, only extends to 883. Because of this, constructions undertaken during Alfonso III`s time as king were not documented.
