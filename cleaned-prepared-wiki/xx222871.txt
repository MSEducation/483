Bluey and Curley is an Australian newspaper comic strip written by the Australian artist, caricaturist, and cartoonist Alex Gurney.nla.au/ndp/del/article/44896616), with the much later far more developed style of the 1955 version (
Few original Bluey and Curley strips are held in public collections, because, throughout his lifetime, Alex Gurney was renowned for his generous habit of giving the original art work of his caricatures, cartoons, and comic strips to anyone who asked.7; 

The characters

The first strip Bluey and Curley strip appeared soon after the start of World War II. It featured two Australian soldiers, Bluey (who had served in the First AIF), and Curley, a new recruit. 
By the end of the war, they had served in every Australian campaign — in North Africa, in the Middle East, in New Guinea, in Northern Australia, and in the Pacific Islands — and, once the war was over, they even went to London and took part in the 1946 Victory Parade.

Creation

By 1939 Alex Gurney was already well established as a caricaturist, cartoonist, and comic strip artist.
In late 1939, following the outbreak of World War II, he created his most famous characters, Bluey and Curley,Memento for Cartoonist, The Mercury, (Tuesday, 20 November 1945), p.11. which first appeared in the "Picture-News" magazine.
He applied for the copyright registration of "Bluey and Curley" on 16 October 1939; and his application was granted on 9 November 1939 (Australian Copyright No.6921).

Syndication

It was transferred to The Sun News-Pictorial in 1940, from whence it was syndicated throughout Australia,   New Zealand and Canada.[ref]
It was syndicated throughout Canada as "Bluey and Curley of the Anzacs:  

Cultural impact

The strip featured a pair of soldiers, "Bluey" (named for his red hair), the Great War veteran who had re-enlisted in the second A.I.F., and Curley (named for his extremely curly hair), the new recruit to the A.I.F. From the late 1930s the somewhat balding, enthusiastic amateur fisherman Alex Gurney, was universally known at the Elwood Angling Club by his nick-name "Curley", and his red-headed mate, Len Anderson was universally known as "Bluey". The nick-names given to each became so much a part of their life that the boat that they fished in was named "Bluey and Curley" (Eidelson, 2006).
The strip was widely appreciated for the good-humoured way it depicted the Australian "diggers" and their "mateship", as well as for its realistic use of Australian idiom of the day., "Gurney, Alexander George (Alex) (1902 - 1955)", Australian Dictionary of Biography, (1996).

Service life

Gurney visited army camps throughout Australia and New Guinea to ensure authenticity.nla.au/ndp/del/article/47704568;    While in New Guinea he contracted malaria and was incapacitated for some time.3.

Post-war life

Gurney was in England in June 1946, as part of an Australian Press Syndicate sent specifically to view the Victory Parade. As well as sending caricatures of various eminent people involved in that parade back to Australia for distribution through the press, he also used the opportunity to have Bluey and Curley attend the parade, and a number of his Bluey and Curley comic strips reflected that event.6.; Bluey and Curley Go to the Victory March, The Sunday Times Comics, The (Perth) Sunday Times, (Sunday, 16 June 1946), p.8.
Gurney's visit to London, and his version of events, as seen through his Bluey and Curley comic strip, was also historically significant for another reason: it was the first time that a newspaper comic strip had ever been transmitted from England to Australia by radio.2.
Although Bluey and Curley were popular with Australians because they related to the slang, attitude, and the lack of respect towards authority exhibited by the main characters,Pilcher, Tim and Brad Brooks.

Gurney's death

Gurney died suddenly, of heart disease, on 4 December 1955. He had collapsed in his motor car parked outside his home.3. He was cremated with Anglican rites.

Rice died as the result of a car accident on 31 December 1956 (New Year's Eve).4 More Deaths on Roads, The Sydney Morning Herald, (Monday, 1 January 1957), p.4; 3 Killed in Crash, The Argus, (Tuesday, 2 January 1957), p.10; Artist Killed in Crash, The Argus, (Wednesday, 2 January 1957), p.9; Death Notice: Rice, Norman Howard, The Sydney Morning Herald, Wednesday, 2 January 1957), p.18. The strip was then drawn by Les Dixon from 1957 until 1975.
