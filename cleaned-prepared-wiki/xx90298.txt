Playing career

Eliáš was drafted by the New Jersey Devils 51st overall (2nd round) in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. 
Along with Petr Sýkora and Jason Arnott, he helped lead the team to the 1999–2000 Stanley Cup championship. He assisted on Arnott's Cup-clinching goal in double overtime in Game 6 at Dallas. The following year he scored a team record 96 points in the regular season, third best in the league. He also played a key role in helping New Jersey win the 2003 Stanley Cup. 
During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he played hockey in the Czech Republic.
Three months into the 2005–06 season, he made his first appearance of the season on January 3, 2006, against the Florida Panthers, resuming his role as an alternate captain (replacing Alexander Mogilny). He picked up where he left off, scoring eight points in his first four games and helping the Devils win his first nine games back with the team. In the first game of the 2006 playoffs against the New York Rangers, he became the 10th player to score six points in an NHL playoff game, with two goals and four assists. Eliáš' 2006 postseason campaign was spectacular, even though the Devils were eliminated by eventual Cup champions, Carolina, in the second round. Eliáš scored 6 goals and added 10 assists for an impressive 16 points in just 9 games.
Unable to reach a deal with the Devils headed into the 2006 off-season, Elias tested unrestricted free agency. In addition to offers to from the Chicago Blackhawks and the Montreal Canadiens, Elias verbally agreed to sign with the rival New York Rangers on July 1. However, talks hit a snag when Rangers GM Glen Sather would not agree on a no-move clause.
He was named the Devils new captain on October 5, 2006, becoming the seventh captain in team history. The previous captain of the Devils was Canadian born defenceman Scott Stevens, now retired. He is also the first European born captain in the history of the franchise.
At the start of the 2007–08 season, Eliáš was stripped of the captaincy by new coach Brent Sutter. The Devils named Jamie Langenbrunner captain on December 5, 2007.
Sutter later placed Eliáš on a top scoring line which consisted of Dainus Zubrus and Brian Gionta. Eliáš was also known to work well with Devils winger Zach Parise, with whom he occasionally played with on "heroes line" and frequently played with on the power-play unit.
On March 17, 2009, Eliáš became the New Jersey Devils' all-time leading scorer by recording his 702nd regular season point, an assist on Brian Gionta's shorthanded goal. Gionta's goal was the game-winner in a 3-2 win over the visiting Chicago Blackhawks, giving the edge for Martin Brodeur's record-breaking 552nd win as a goaltender to pass Patrick Roy, who held the former record at 551 wins. Chants of "Pa-trik E-li-as" were heard as Devils' PA announcer Kevin Clark confirmed to the crowd that Eliáš had broken John MacLean's record. Eliáš was the second star of the night, only behind Brodeur. 
He was the winner of the 2009 Golden Hockey Stick as the world's best Czech hockey player, ending Jaromír Jágr's four-year streak. He scored his 300th career goal on December 12, 2009, against the Philadelphia Flyers.
Despite a weak first half by the Devils during the 2010–11 season, Patrik Elias was selected to be the Devils sole representative during the 2011 NHL All-Star Game. This was his third all-star appearance, and was eventually selected by Team Staal in the first ever NHL All-Star draft. On February 19, 2011, Eliáš recorded the 800th point of his career, with his third assist of the game against the Carolina Hurricanes. At the conclusion of the seaosn, on April 1, 2011, Eliáš scored his 8th career hat trick against the Philadelphia Flyers.
In the following 2011–12 season, Eliáš scored two goals (347, 348) against the Montreal Canadiens to tie, then pass John MacLean as the leading goal scorer for the Devils on December 17, 2011.
