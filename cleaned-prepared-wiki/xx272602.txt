Time-division Long-Term Evolution (TD-LTE), also referred to as Long-Term Evolution Time-Division Duplex (LTE TDD), is a 4G telecommunications technology and standard co-developed by an international coalition of companies, including China Mobile, Datang Telecom, Huawei, Nokia Solutions and Networks, Qualcomm, Samsung, and ST-Ericsson. It is one of two variants of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology standard, the other being Frequency-Division Long-Term Evolution (LTE FDD).

Overview of technology

Time-Division Duplex LTE, abbreviated as TD-LTE, TDD LTE, or LTE TDD is one of the two mobile data transmission technologies that fall under the international standard of LTE, the other being Frequency-Division Duplex (LTE FDD).
There are two major differences between TD-LTE and LTE FDD: how data is uploaded and downloaded, and what frequency spectra the networks are deployed in. While LTE FDD uses paired frequencies to upload and download data,  The TD-LTE spectrum is generally cheaper to access, and has less traffic. Further, the bands for TD-LTE overlap with those used for WiMAX, which can easily be upgraded to support TD-LTE.
Despite the differences in how the two types of LTE handle data transmission, TD-LTE and LTE FDD share 90 percent of their core technology, making it possible for the same chipsets and networks to use both versions of LTE.

History

The creation of TD-LTE involved a coalition of international companies that worked to develop and test the technology. and Huawei, which worked to deploy TD-LTE networks, and later developed technology allowing TD-LTE equipment to operate in white spacesâ€”frequency spectra between broadcast TV stations.[ref]
