The 1981 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1981, and lasted until November 30, 1981. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin.    The 1981 season was high in activity with 18 tropical depressions and twelve storms forming during the year.  Nine of these systems made landfall.  Cindy, Harvey, and Irene neither affected land directly nor indirectly.
Hurricane Dennis caused millions of dollars in damage in Dade County, Florida and produced the highest rainfall totals of any tropical cyclone this season.  Tropical Depression Eight caused the most damage, due to flooding in Texas at the end of August, and led to most fatalities of any tropical cyclone this season (five).  Tropical Depressions Two and Eight caused a majority of the damage and fatalities this season, with both affecting Louisiana and Texas.  Katrina was the only named storm with associated fatalities.
