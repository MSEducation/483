History

The station began broadcasting as WABI in November 1924,
Originally, Community Broadcasting Service was controlled by Frederick B. Simpson; however, in 1949, health problems forced him to retire and sell WABI to a partnership between former Maine governor Horace A. Hildreth and Murray Carpenter.
Community Broadcasting Service merged with Journal Publications in 1971 to form Diversified Communications;
Diversified announced in 1993 that it would put most of its broadcasting properties, including WABI and what had become WYOU-FM, up for sale;
Clear Channel Communications signed a local marketing agreement with Gopher Hill in early 2001;
Clear Channel announced on November 16, 2006 that it would sell its Bangor stations after being bought by private equity firms, On September 1, 2013, WAEI was taken off-the-air; though Blueberry officials told the Bangor Daily News that "We have not made any final decisions regarding what's going to happen with that radio station," in a filing with the Federal Communications Commission the company stated that it would intend to sell the station, and that if a buyer is not found the license will be surrendered.

Programming

Before going silent, WAEI's programming was largely provided by Fox Sports Radio; the station also aired Imus in the Morning, that now airs on WEZQ, NASCAR Nationwide and Camping World Truck Series races, which are now carried by WNZS, and Maine Black Bears basketball and baseball games, which now air on WGUY.
