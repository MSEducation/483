History

The Paris Herald was founded on 4 October 1887, as the European edition of the New York Herald by the parent paper's owner, James Gordon Bennett, Jr. The company was based in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris.
After the 1918 death of Bennett, Frank Andrew Munsey bought the New York Herald and the Paris Herald. Munsey sold the Herald newspapers in 1924 to the New York Tribune, and the Paris Herald became the Paris Herald Tribune while the New York paper became New York Herald Tribune.
The newspaper became a mainstay of American expatriate culture in Europe. In Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises, the first thing the novel's protagonist Jake Barnes does on returning from Spain to France is to buy the New York Herald from a kiosk in Bayonne and read it at a cafe. In Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 film Breathless, the female lead character Patricia (played by Jean Seberg) is an American student journalist who sells the New York Herald Tribune on the streets of Paris. Pages from the day's paper can be seen tacked up through the office windows, a tradition that was to continue with the International Herald Tribune.
In 1959 John Hay Whitney, a businessman and United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom, bought the New York Herald Tribune and its European edition. In 1966 the New York Herald Tribune was merged into the short-lived New York World Journal Tribune and ceased publication, but the Whitney family kept the Paris paper going through partnerships. In December 1966 The Washington Post became a joint owner.
The New York Times became a joint owner of the Paris Herald Tribune in May 1967, whereupon the newspaper became known as the International Herald Tribune (IHT).
In 1974, IHT began transmitting facsimile pages of the paper between nations and opened a printing site near London. In 1977 the paper opened a second site in ZÃ¼rich.
IHT began transmitting electronic images of newspaper pages from Paris to Hong Kong via satellite in 1980, making the paper simultaneously available on opposite sides of the planet. This was the first such intercontinental transmission of an English-language daily newspaper and followed the pioneering efforts of the Chinese-language Sing Tao Daily newspaper.
In 1991, The Washington Post and The New York Times became sole and equal shareholders of IHT. In February 2005 it opened its Asia newsroom in Hong Kong.

Acquisition by The New York Times

As of 2003, IHT was completely owned by The New York Times Company, after that firm purchased the 50% stake owned by
The Washington Post Company on 30 December 2002. The takeover ended a 35-year partnership between the two domestic competitors. The Post was forced to sell when the Times threatened to pull out and start a competing paper. As a result, the Post entered into an agreement to publish selected articles in The Wall Street Journals European edition. Since the takeover the newspaper has been subtitled "The Global Edition of the New York Times".
In 2008, the NYT Company announced the merger of the New York Times and IHT websites. In March 2009 the IHT website became the global version of NYTimes. In 2013, the New York Times Company announced that the newspaper itself would be renamed The International New York Times to reflect the company's focus on its core New York Times newspaper and to build its international presence. The IHTs old domain, iht.nytimes. On 14 October 2013 the International Herald Tribune appeared on newsstands for the last time. It came with a supplemental section, titled Turning the Page I,  a retrospective on the Herald Tribune's past articles, photographs and place in newspaper history. On October 15, 2013, the International New York Times debuted with a 'Premier Edition' flash above the masthead. It came with a supplement titled Turning the Page II, which discussed and predicted likely developments in many global areas including energy, finance, technology and media.
