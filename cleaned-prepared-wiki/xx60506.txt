Early life

Yusuf was born as Mark Hanson to two academics  in Washington State and raised in Northern California. He grew up a practicing Greek Orthodox Christian and attended prep schools on both the east and west coasts. In 1977, after a near-death experience and reading the Qur'an, he converted to Islam from Chrisitanity (he seemed destined for the Greek Orthodox priesthood at his early age).

Education

Soon after converting, Yusuf moved to England, Spain, and eventually Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates to pursue serious study of Islam. There he was introduced to Mauritanian scholars and began more serious study of various Islamic disciplines including Maliki fiqh. This eventually led him to travel to Mauritania itself in order to study directly with the renowned scholar and sage of the land, Sidi Muhammad ould Fahfu al-Massumi, more famously known as Murabit al-Hajj.Z. Grewal, Islam Is a Foreign Country: American Muslims and the Global Crisis of Authority, p 161 During his intermittent stays there, Yusuf both lived and studied directly with Murabit al-Hajj.Another Mother of the Believers | AE
