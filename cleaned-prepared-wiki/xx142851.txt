Views

Hindutva

In January 2002 the AICC issued a statement signed by Joseph D'souza and John Dayal asking State governments and the national government to prevent efforts by the Sangh Parivar to stir up communal violence in the Adivasi tribal belt in Northern India. It talked of a "vicious Hindutva communal rhetoric .. targeting Christians in the region". It said  RSS cadres were running schools that "follow a curricula and textual material, which is outside the pale of any academic and public scrutiny, blatantly rewrites history, and poisons young minds".[ref]
</ref>
In 2005 Dayal again expressed concern that Ekal Vidyalaya ("single teacher") schools run by the RSS Hindu nationalist organisation in tribal districts were spreading hatred towards members of the Christian minority.[ref]
</ref>
Dayal has claimed that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has spent millions of dollars in an attempt to convert tribal people in central India into Hindu nationalists. 
On 17 October 2004 a ceremony was organised by the World Hindu Council (Vishva Hindu Parishad – VHP) in Orissa at which about 300 tribal Christians were "reconverted" to Hinduism.  Dayal said the event was part of a vicious and hostile hate campaign.[ref]
</ref>
In a 2004 interview following the defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the return to power of the Congress Party, Dayal said that the change was because "People have rejected the ideology of hate, consisting of xenophobia, narrow nationalism and a sustained persecution of Muslims and Christians".  He went on to compare Hindutva to neo-Nazism and Apartheid.[ref]
</ref>

Attacks on Christians

Dayal has said that militant Hindutva groups exploit economically backward people in attacks on Christians and Muslims: "Dalits and tribals are used as instruments.  They are paid, drugged, alcoholized, they are in a stupor".
Speaking after the Bharatiya Janata Party had made gains in riot-affected parts of Gujarat, Dayal said "Christians have never been more afraid ... I have been expecting the very worst since the B.J.P. came to power, and the worst, I think, may still be in the future.[ref]
</ref>
With levels of violence in Gujarat rising, on 1 October 1998 Dayal remarked "The AICU is surprised that Union Government and members of the ruling coalition, including the BJP, have not come out categorically in denouncing the violence against Christians".[ref]
</ref>
In February 2002 after a renewed series of attacks on Christians Dayal said "Physically, many of the incidents are now less obvious, but there is a 24-hour reign of terror, which occasionally bursts into violence".[ref]
</ref>
In May 2002 Dayal urged General Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, to stop cross-border terrorism. He said this was giving fundamentalist forces ammunition in hate campaigns against minorities.

Church property

Dayal represents the conservatives in the AICU.
At a seminar in Goa in  August 2009, former Union minister Eduardo Faleiro said that church property should be brought under the ambit of state laws, as was the case with other religions.  This was endorsed by Remy Denis and other liberals. 
However, Dayal opposed any change.
He said that the "Christian situation" was radically and materially different from that of the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh religions, and existing laws were sufficient.[ref]
</ref>
In March 2012 two Baptist churches in Imphal, Manipur were ordered to vacate within 15 days.
The authorities threatened to use force if the churches were not dismantled on schedule.
The All India Christian Council took up the issue with the national and state minority commissions.  According to Dayal "Christians in Manipur are facing increasing threats from the public as well as the state government".[ref]
</ref>
The same month, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia said that it is "necessary to destroy all the churches of the region".
As AICC Secretary General, John Dayal asked that India and other countries help assure the safety of churches in other countries of the Arabian peninsula.
The AICC pointed out that destruction of churches would be counter to the United Nations Charter and to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance And of Discrimination Based on Religion Or Belief.[ref]

Dalit rights

A survey by the NGO Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan found that the "Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers" was being abused.
Apart from encouraging Dalits to remain in menial jobs, in many cases some or all of the money was embezzled.
In March 2012 Dayal said "There is a massive scandal of graft between bank officials, politicians and middle men to fleece ignorant people who are given 50 per cent of the loan only but made liable for the full amount even as rest of the money is taken away by crooks. Collectors in villages must crack down on such miscreants and wherever such cases are found, government must waive off the loans or it would be condoning cheating and criminal actions".[ref]
</ref>
John Dayal has spoken out against bills that prevent or penalise conversion to Christianity passed in various states in India.[ref]
</ref>
A deeply religious person, Dayal has written "How a community treats its poor is, for the Bible, the acid test of its life.  And the way a community will be changed is through the poor".

Criticism

Rediff... Christian activists ... aggressively seek to weaken Hindu society in terms of numbers as well as space".  Noting that Dayal had objected that on the 2001 Census form a scheduled caste, or Dalit, could chose only between the Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist faiths she said "If conversion to Christianity certifies social equality, why would there be a 'Dalit Christian'? As for guaranteeing economic freedom, don't make me laugh".[ref]
</ref>
Discussing Dayal's 2005 letter to the prime minister about attacks on Christians including the rape of nuns, murder of priests and destruction of churches, P.N Benjamin, coordinator of the Bangalore Initiative for Religious Dialogue, said Dayal "opens his mouth and wields his pen only to spew venom on the Hindu community".  Benjamin said most of the attacks on Christians had been in response to aggressive evangelising.[ref]
</ref>
In 2008 the journalist François Gautier described Dayal as a fanatic who was "radicalizing" his flock. The assertion was made in an op-ed  in The Indian Express that accused Sonia Gandhi of responsibility for the 2006 Mumbai train bombings.[ref]
</ref>
Noted scholar Rajiv Malhotra, in his acclaimed book Breaking India, has also criticized Mr. Dayal for spreading lies about Hinduism and painting a biased picture of the Indian minorities in the west.[ref]
