History

Origin

Occidental College was founded on April 20, 1887, by a group of Presbyterian clergy, missionaries, and laymen, including James George Bell. The college's first term began a year later with 27 men and 13 women students, and tuition of $50 a year. Initially located in Boyle Heights, the college declined to move to an undeveloped area called "Westwood" and moved, instead, to a new campus in Los Angeles' Highland Park neighborhood in 1898.
Despite a strong Presbyterian presence on its campus, Occidental began to lessen its ties to the church in 1900.  In 1912, the school began construction of a new campus located in Los Angeles' Eagle Rock neighborhood. The Eagle Rock campus was to be designed by noted California architect Myron Hunt. That same year, Occidental President John Willis Baer announced the trustees' decision to convert Oxy into an all-men's institution. However, students protested, and the idea was abandoned.

Move to Eagle Rock

Two weeks after Booker T. Washington came to visit Occidental, on March 27, 1914, Swan, Fowler, and Johnson Halls were dedicated at its new Eagle Rock campus. The Eagle Rock campus covers over , much of which is undeveloped land on a hill known as "Mt. Fiji".
In April 1917, the college formed an Army Corps to aid the war effort. The college opened its Hillside Theatre in 1925, and a student union in 1928. During World War II, many students left Occidental to fight in the war. In July 1943, 53 students established a Navy V-12 unit on campus and left for active duty.

1960-present

In 1962, Time described Occidental as a little giant in a story about the college's rise to national prominence."Little Giant" Time, retrieved 6-13-2012 In 1969, the school opened its first two co-ed dormitories, and two more followed a year later. On May 6, 1970, the faculty voted to suspend classes in the wake of the Kent State shootings and America's invasion of Cambodia. Subsequently, Oxy students wrote 7,000 letters to Washington D.C., protesting U.S. involvement in the war in Southeast Asia.
The era also inspired positive changes in administration in regards to ethnic minority rights. The college received grants designed to help equal the playing field for students traditionally neglected in higher education. This laid the foundation for a series of actions aiming to continue closing the access gap for minorities of virtually all categories in the decades to come, the most important of which was President John Brooks Slaughter's institution of the college's mission statement, around which the entire college would function and aspire to both academic excellence and equity.  The mission statement was written just 18 months after Slaughter was appointed President in 1988."Welcome to Multicultural U.", pp.1-2, Los Angeles Times, Mithers, Caroline L. (1999), retrieved 6-11-2012"Mission", www.edu, retrieved 01-08-2013 Recently, the 2007 U.S. News and World Report ranked Occidental College the 36th best liberal arts college in the country, tied with Bard College in New York and Whitman College in Washington, citing both ethnic and economic diversity as key achievements."Oxy Ranks High in Guides", www.edu, retrieved 01-08-2013
In 1979, Occidental installed Water Forms II (see image below), a kinetic fountain designed by professor George Baker. The fountain is a campus landmark and was featured prominently in the 1984 film Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. During the 1984 Olympic Games, some track events were held at Occidental's Patterson Field. By 1986, for the first time since World War II, women students outnumbered men. Today, the college is approximately 60 percent female and 40 percent male; roughly equivalent to the national average. On July 1, 2006, Susan Prager became Occidental's first female president. She then left her position in 2007 during the fall term. On July 1, 2009, Jonathan Veitch, formerly dean of The New School's Eugene Lang College, became Occidental's 15th president and the first to be a native Angeleno.

Lawsuits regarding the handling of sexual assault cases

A Federal civil rights complaint was filed in April 2013 by 37 students stating that the school "deliberately discouraged victims from reporting sexual assaults, misled students about their rights during campus investigations, retaliated against whistle-blowers, and handed down minor punishment to known assailants who in some cases allegedly struck again". This complaint was later joined by 13 others, including members of the college staff supportive of their concerns. Typical of the allegations is one in which a rapist was found culpable by the college, and given as sole punishment the writing of a  2 1/2 page essay. This complaint is currently under active investigation by the Federal Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights.  On September 18, 2013, the college also settled a lawsuit brought by 10 students also alleging improper treatment of their sexual assault cases, on undisclosed terms.latimes.latimes.story Occidental College chief asks for reconciliation after accusations, 20 September 2013
To end sexual misconduct on campus and support those experiencing it, the College has taken the following actions: adopted a new interim sexual misconduct policy; hired a former assistant district attorney, Ruth Jones, as a full-time, independent Title IX coordinator; added a new 24-hour, 7-days-a-week telephone hotline; hired a full-time survivor advocate; conducted a comprehensive internal audit of its Clery Act reporting practices; doubled staff for Project SAFE, a campus advocacy and education program dedicated to addressing sexual misconduct; expanded preventative education for all students through online programs, the office of Residence Education, Project SAFE, and a speakers' series, and created a permanent Sexual Misconduct Advisory Board made up of students, faculty and staff.com/news/2014/01/26/ruth-jones-named-new-title-ix-coordinator/

Campus

Architect Myron Hunt, who also designed the Rose Bowl Stadium, designed Oxy's original buildings in a Mediterranean style, with covered walkways and tile roofs. Currently, there are 12 on-campus residence halls. The three original buildings of the 1914 campus still stand today, although seismic concerns have limited them to classrooms and academic offices. Some buildings, such as the Hameetman Science Center (designed by Anshen + Allen, 2003), deviates from the original architecture with its large glass windows and metal balconies (its lobby houses a large Foucault pendulum). Occidental's newest building, the 278-bed Rangeview Residence Hall, opened in January 2008 at a reported cost of $38.8 million. Renamed Berkus Hall in 2013, it is the first residence hall built in 25 years."Upper Division Housing", www.edu, retrieved 6-15-2012

Master Plan

The most recent Occidental College Master Plan was released in 2006 and filed with the City of Los Angeles.  The plan's main focuses were to restore and adaptively reuse existing buildings, build new projects that contribute to a coherent campus form, pedestrianize the academic campus, create green buildings and green landscapes, and encourage and/or participate in neighborhood compatible development.  In 2009 the College withdrew the plan from the City.  In a campus email, President Veitch explained that the motivation was to start a new planning process that would be more inclusive to all parties affected by the college.  According to an Occidental Weekly article, the move caught many off guard and was a bad start to the process if the school wanted it be more inclusive.
Since 2009, there has been no movement around campus to start up a new Master Plan.  However, the college has released a new Strategic Plan that will guide the college from 2012 - 2017.

Academics and resources

There are 31 majors offered on campus and there is a 10:1 student-faculty ratio. The average class size is 19 students and most students take four classes per semester.

Core program

Divided in three parts, the Core Program was designed by the faculty of Occidental to unify and enhance the liberal arts education offered by the school. The Core Program requires students to achieve the following:
First-year seminars (eight course hours in total) are the centerpiece of the Core Program. Students are given a variety of class choices to fulfill the seminar requirement and to satisfy the first-year writing requirement. While the classes range in topic, each is based on a curriculum of cultural studies. The classes are designed to expose students to the rigor of college academics and to the four principles of the college missionâ€”Excellence, Equity, Community, and Service.
The Core Program's emphasis on global literacy requires students to take a minimum of three courses that touch on at least three of the following geographical areas: Africa and the Middle East; Asia and the Pacific; Europe; Latin America; the United States; and Intercultural. Students are also required to demonstrate proficiency in writing and in a foreign language and take courses in the fine arts and in the sciences, mathematics, or other courses that address formal methods of reasoning.
The final portion of the Core Program requires students to pass a senior comprehensive examination in their chosen field. Comprehensive examinations may include seminars, creative projects, fieldwork, oral exams, theses, or field research projects.
