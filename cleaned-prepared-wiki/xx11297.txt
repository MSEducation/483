One version of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-F) appears in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Trek Online. Its design is based on the entry submitted by Adam Ihle for the 2011 "Design the next Enterprise" contest, a joint venture between Cryptic Studios, CBS, and Intel, which ran shortly before the game went "free to play." The Enterprise-F made its first appearance in the mission "Boldly They Rode", at the point where the USS Enterprise-F appears to help the player defeat the Dominion fleet surrounding Deep Space Nine

=Mirror Universe=

The Mirror Universe first appeared in the original series as alternate reality where the militaristic Terran Empire exists in place of the regular universe's United Federation of Planets ("Mirror, Mirror"). Subsequent episodes have shown that the divergence at least predates the Moon landing, with licensed novels putting the divergence before Shakespeare, or even classic Greek literature.
Registry: ISS Enterprise (NX-01)

Class: NX

Service: 2150s

Captains: Maximilian Forrest (Vaughn Armstrong), Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula)

The Star Trek: Enterprise episode "In a Mirror, Darkly" features a Mirror Universe version of the NX-01 Enterprise. This ship is equipped with a cloaking device, deflector shields, a tractor beam, a prototype agony booth, and different exterior markings. It is commanded by Captain Maximilian Forrest, although for a brief time his first officer, Commander Jonathan Archer, takes command following a mutiny. This Enterprise is destroyed by the Tholians.
Registry: ISS Enterprise (NCC-1701)

Class: Constitution

Service: 2260s

Captains: Christopher Pike, James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard Nimoy)

A Mirror Universe Enterprise appears in the original Star Trek episode "Mirror, Mirror". The ship is equipped with an agony booth and the mirror in the captain's quarters conceals Captain Kirk's deadly Tantalus device. The ISS Enterprise was originally the same shooting model as the regular Enterprise. The remastered version of "Mirror, Mirror" includes a CGI version of Enterprise with "ISS" markings on the hull and minor physical differences from USS Enterprise, such as a larger deflector dish, a taller bridge, and altered nacelle details.

=Altered reality timeline=

The 2009 Star Trek film takes place in a new reality created when the Romulan character Nero traveled through time via an artificial black hole. thumb|left|NCC-1701
Registry: 

Class: Constitution

Service: 2258 – ongoing

Captains: Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood), Spock (Zachary Quinto), James T. Kirk (Chris Pine)
The Enterprise is shown during its construction phase at the Riverside Shipyard in Iowa during the movie.  A brief shot of the NCC-1701 is seen as the shuttlecraft carrying Kirk and the new recruits into space departs the shipyard.
Measurements for this version's final size range from 610 meters to 910 meters., which would make it larger than the Next Generation D and E versions, in fact it would be the largest USS Enterprise in the series history. (not counting the XCV 330, which is only seen as a model). This would result in a height of 167m, and a beam of 339m.

Captain's yacht

The captain's yacht is a large auxiliary starship built into the design of several Federation starship designs including the Galaxy-class and Sovereign-class. It was docked to the underside of the saucer section. On the USS Enterprise-E, the name of the captain's yacht is the Cousteau. In 2375, the crew of the USS Enterprise-E used the Cousteau to travel to the surface of the Ba'ku homeworld.
Designer Andrew Probert came up with the concept of the captain's yacht while designing the USS Enterprise-D. Although it was never seen in use, it is labeled on the master systems display screen in main engineering, docked at the bottom of the saucer section almost directly opposite the main bridge. Probert suggested possible ways for the yacht to be used during the first season, including not showing the yacht but mentioning it in dialogue, but his ideas were rejected. The Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual (page 164) claims that the producers almost used the yacht in TNG: "Samaritan Snare", but decided to use an "executive shuttlecraft" due to budgetary constraints. According to Patrick Stewart, the yacht would have been called the Calypso. Rick Sternbach designed similar craft into the USS Voyager and the USS Equinox, known as the aeroshuttle and the waverider, respectively. As on the Enterprise-D, however, these vessels were only depicted on technical schematics and never seen in operation or referred to in dialog.
Ronald B. Moore notes in the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual that real-life naval tradition would insist on calling such a craft the captain's gig rather than the captain's yacht.

Reception and impact

thumb|left|Space Shuttle Enterprise As the result of a successful letter writing campaign, NASA named the initial flight-test Space Shuttle Enterprise. In 1994, the real aircraft carrier Enterprise hosted a Star Trek convention, and Star Trek memorabilia could be found throughout the ship.
