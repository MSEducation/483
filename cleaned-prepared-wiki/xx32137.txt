Name

It is generally accepted that Calabasas as the city name is derived from the Spanish calabaza meaning "pumpkin," "squash," or "gourd"Hogle, Gene NAC Green Book of Pacific Coast Touring (1931) National Automobile Club p.25 (cf. with the word calabash).  Some historians hold the theory that Calabasas is a translation of the Chumash word calahoosa.
In honor of its namesake, the City of Calabasas and the Calabasas Chamber of Commerce hold an annual Pumpkin Festival in October, including carnival games, exhibits, demonstrations, and live entertainment. The festival has evolved from a small town fair to a significant annual event.
