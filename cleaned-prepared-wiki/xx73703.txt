Jean-Claude Trichet (; born 20 December 1942) is a French civil servant who was the president of the European Central Bank from 2003 to 2011. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements. In 2008, Trichet ranked fifth on Newsweek's list of the world's most powerful along with economic triumvirs Ben Bernanke (fourth) and Masaaki Shirakawa (sixth).

Biography

Born in Lyon, France of a Jewish family, Trichet was educated at the École des Mines de Nancy, from which he graduated in 1964. He later trained at the Institut d'études politiques de Paris (best known as Sciences Po), finishing in 1966, and the École nationale d'administration (ENA) from 1969–1971, two French higher education institutions in the field of political science and state administration.
In 1987 Trichet became a member of an influential Washington-based financial advisory body, the Group of Thirty. Later, in 1993 he was appointed governor of Banque de France. On 1 November 2003 he took Wim Duisenberg's place as president of the European Central Bank. (Most European Union leaders present at a 1998 special summit believed that Wim Duisenberg had agreed to a compromise with the French representatives and would step down from his office halfway through his eight-year term.)
On 1/26/2012, the board of the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company approved the nomination of JC Trichet to the Board (to be formally validated by the General Assembly of shareholders on 5/31/12), where he will represent (with Dominique d'Hinnin of the Lagardère Group) the Sogeade - the structure bearing the French shareholders' interests.lefigaro.fr 1/26/2012 1/26/2012
On April 2012, Trichet was also appointed Bruegel's new chairman for a period of three years.europeanvoice.aspx He will chair an 11-member Board, appointed by Bruegel's members, whose main task is to make decisions on the think-tank's strategy.
Trichet succeeded Mario Monti as chairman of the European branch of the Trilateral Commission in 2012.

Banking scandal

In January 2003, Trichet was put on trial with eight others charged with irregularities at Crédit Lyonnais, one of France's biggest banks. Trichet was in charge of the French treasury at that time. He was cleared in June 2003, which left the way clear for him to move to the ECB.

2009 Banking Crisis

Within the European Central Bank, Trichet strongly resisted any contemplation of Greece defaulting on its debt. It was only in October 2011, with the end of his term imminent,  that consensus was reached to allow a 50% cut in the value of Greek bonds.

Criticism

Trichet has been criticised for the ECB's response to the Great Recession, which emphasised price stability over recovery and growth.

Personal life

At age 22, he married Aline Rybalka, a diplomat and translator whose parents immigrated to France from Ukraine. They have two sons: Pierre-Alexis Trichet (born 1972), a marketing strategy director at telecommunications company Orange SA; and Jean-Nicolas Trichet (born 1974), a musician and producer.Bloomberg: "Trichet Proving Prophet-Making No Panacea in Recovery" By Simon Kennedy and Jana Randow August 21, 2009
