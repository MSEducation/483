History

The first flight abroad from Switzerland was on July 21, 1921, but the search for a location for a major airport wasn't started until 1943 inside the Canton of Zürich.  The site in Zürich was chosen in 1945 by the federal government and sold 655 hectares of Kloten Ordnance Depot to the Canton of Zürich. Thus the Canton of Zürich had control of the airport.  The construction of the airport began the next year.
The first flights off the west runway were not until 1948.  The new terminal opened in 1953 with a large air show that ran for three days. In 1947 the airport handled 133638 passengers on 12766 airline flights; in 1952, 372832 passengers on 24728 airline flights.American Aviation 3 August 1953 p35
The first expansion of the airport was submitted in 1956, but the budget for the expansion was not approved by the Swiss Government until 1958 and the expansion was completed in 1961.
The airport was again submitted and approved for renovation in 1970, and Terminal B was completed in 1971.  The first signs of noise mitigation for the airport were in 1972, when a night-time curfew was enacted, as well as in 1974 when new approach routes were introduced.  Runway 14/32 was opened in 1976, and 16/34 began renovation.
The noise of aircraft became an issue and a noise charge was instituted in 1980, and in 1984, an agreement was made regarding arrivals and departures to the airport via German airspace.  The next largest event for the airport was in 1999, when the Parliament of the Canton of Zürich approved privatization of Zurich Airport.  It was not until 2000, that Flughafen Zürich AG, trading under the brand Unique was appointed as the new airport operator. The brand Unique was dropped in favour of Zurich Airport and Flughafen Zürich in 2010.
The airport lost a lot of traffic when Swissair shut down its operations. Since Lufthansa took over its successor Swiss International Air Lines, traffic has started growing again.
A treaty was signed in 2001, regarding the limitation of flights over Germany. Negotiations have been under way since 2003 about the procedures and noise pollution over Germany and Switzerland.
In 2003, Zurich Airport completed a major expansion project in which it built a new parking garage, a new midfield terminal, and an automated underground train to link the midfield terminal to the main terminal. In November 2008, a complete renovation and rebuild of the old dock "B" structure was announced. The new dock "B" opened in November 2011, and provides segregated access to and from aircraft for Schengen and non-Schengen passengers.

Infrastructure

Terminals

The airport has three airside piers, which are known as docks A, B and E. A central air-side building is directly linked to docks A and B, which take the form of finger piers. Dock E, as the midfield terminal is now known, is connected to the central air-side building by an automated underground train, known as the Skymetro. Dock A is exclusively used by flights to and from the Schengen Area, whilst dock E is exclusively used by flights outside the Schengen Area. Dock B can be used by all flights.
The ground-side terminal complex comprises several buildings, and includes several airline check-in areas, a shopping mall, a railway station, car parks, and a bus and tram terminal. Departing passengers access the departure level of the central air-side building, which includes duty-free shopping and various bars and restaurants, via airport security. Passengers are segregated between Schengen and non-Schengen areas on the way to the respective docks, with non-Schengen passengers passing through emigration controls.
Schengen and non-Schengen arriving passengers are handled in separate areas of the central airside building, with non-Schengen passengers passing through immigration controls to reach the ground-side terminal complex.
