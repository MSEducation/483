In June, 1861 Baxter enlisted for the American Civil War, joining the 12th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry as regimental surgeon.  He took part in the Peninsula Campaign, including the Battles of Yorktown, Hanover Court House, and Seven Pines.Ellis, Norwich University, page 583
Baxter later served as head of Campbell General Hospital in Washington, D.C.United States Army Medical Department, Army Medical Bulletin, Issues 57–64, 1941, page 124  In 1865 he received brevet promotions to Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel of Volunteers, and in 1867 he received a brevet as a Colonel in the regular Army., Massachusetts in the Army and Navy During the War of 1861–65, page 400

Post Civil War

After the war the Army's health care professionals were organized as the Medical Department, and Baxter was appointed Assistant Medical Purveyor with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the regular Army.D. Appleton and Company, The American Annual Cyclopedia and Register of Important Events, 1891, page 632  In 1871 he received a Master of Arts degree from UVM.University of Vermont, Catalogue of University of Vermont, 1791–1890, 1890, page 66
In March, 1872 Baxter was appointed Chief Medical Purveyor, and in 1874 he was promoted to Colonel.Columbian University, Historical Catalogue of the Officers and Graduates of the Columbian University, 1891, page 141
Baxter's duties included serving as personal physician to the President of the United States.  He attended James A. Garfield's family, but was out of town when Charles J. Guiteau shot Garfield in July 1881.  As a result, Baxter did not examine Garfield following the shooting or treat him during his subsequent illness. Clark, The Murder of James A. Garfield, 1993, page 42Martin S. Nowak, The White House in Mourning: Deaths and Funerals of Presidents in Office, 2010, page 99  By the time he rushed back to Washington, Doctor Willard Bliss had taken charge and would not let Baxter see the wounded President.  According to contemporary accounts, Bliss stated that Baxter was attempting to see Garfield out of a desire for personal glory and fame, a charge which had the effect of causing Baxter to minimize his involvement so that Bliss would not seem to be correct. Garfield, page 93  In fact Bliss had only recently been readmitted to the District of Columbia Medical Society, which had expelled him in 1870 over his advocacy for African American doctors to be admitted.  In addition, he had been expelled over willingness to consult with homeopaths at a time when most medical professionals were allopaths and disdained homeopathy.  Having been readmitted to the Society so recently, Bliss likely maintained his lead role in Garfield's treatment as a way to restore his own reputation.Gloria Moldow, Women Doctors in Gilded-age Washington: Race, Gender, and Professionalization, page 98Candice Millard, Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine and the Murder of a President, 2012, page 163New York Homeopathic Medical Society, Documents of the New York Homeopathic Medical Society, Volume 5, 1872, page 926

Army Surgeon General

In August 1890, Baxter was named the Army's Surgeon General and promoted to Brigadier General, appointed by President Benjamin Harrison, who was a longtime patient.  Baxter's appointment had been championed by Secretary of War Redfield Proctor, a fellow Vermonter and Civil War veteran. Baxter Promoted, August 17, 1890Ludwig M.
