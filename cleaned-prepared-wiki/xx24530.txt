[[Acetonitrile]]

CATEGORIES: Hazardous air pollutants, Nitriles, Solvents

Acetonitrile is the chemical compound with the formula . This colourless liquid is the simplest organic nitrile (hydrogen cyanide is a simpler nitrile, but the cyanide anion is not classed as organic). It is produced mainly as a byproduct of acrylonitrile manufacture. It is used as a polar aprotic solvent in organic synthesis and in the purification of butadiene.industrialchemistry.pdf, Ashford's Dictionary of Industrial Chemicals, Third edition, 2011, page 76.
In the laboratory, it is used as a medium-polarity solvent that is miscible with water and range of organic solvents, but not saturated hydrocarbons.  It has a convenient liquid range and a high dielectric constant of 38.8. With a dipole moment of 3.92 D,Steiner, P. A., and Gordy, W., 1966, J. molec. Spectrosc., 21, 291. acetonitrile dissolves a wide range of ionic and nonpolar compounds and is useful as a mobile phase in HPLC and LC-MS.  The N-C-C skeleton is linear with a short C-N distance of 1.16 Å. "Molecular Structures of Hydrogen Cyanide and Acetonitrile as Studied by Gas Electron Diffraction."

Acetonitrile was first prepared in 1847 by the French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas.

Applications

Acetonitrile is used mainly as a solvent in the purification of butadiene in refineries.
It is widely used in battery applications because of its relatively high dielectric constant and ability to dissolve electrolytes.  For similar reasons it is a popular solvent in cyclic voltammetry.
Its low viscosity and low chemical reactivity make it a popular choice for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Acetonitrile plays a significant role as the dominant solvent used in the manufacture of DNA oligonucleotides from monomers.
Industrially, it is used as a solvent for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and photographic film.

Organic synthesis

Acetonitrile is a common two-carbon building block in organic synthesis Its reaction with cyanogen chloride affords malononitrile.

Ligand in coordination chemistry

In inorganic chemistry, acetonitrile is employed as a solvent and often an easily displaceable ligand. For example, 
A related complex is Cu(MeCN)4+.  The  groups in these complexes are rapidly displaced by many other ligands.

Production

Acetonitrile is a by-product from the manufacture of acrylonitrile.  Most is combusted to support the intended process but an estimated several thousand tons are retained for the above mentioned applications., 32.3 million pounds (14,700 t) of acetonitrile were produced in the US.

Acetonitrile shortage in 2008–2009

Starting in October 2008, the worldwide supply of acetonitrile was low because Chinese production was shut down for the Olympics.  Furthermore, a U.S. factory was damaged in Texas during Hurricane Ike. The global shortage of acetonitrile continued through early 2009.

Safety

Toxicity

Acetonitrile has only a modest toxicity in small doses. Generally the onset of toxic effects is delayed, due to the time required for the body to metabolize acetonitrile to cyanide (generally about 2–12 hours).
Cases of acetonitrile poisoning in humans (or, to be more specific, of cyanide poisoning after exposure to acetonitrile) are rare but not unknown, by inhalation, ingestion and (possibly) by skin absorption. The symptoms, which do not usually appear for several hours after the exposure, include breathing difficulties, slow pulse rate, nausea, and vomiting: Convulsions and coma can occur in serious cases, followed by death from respiratory failure. The treatment is as for cyanide poisoning, with oxygen, sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate among the most commonly used remedies.
It has been used in formulations for nail polish remover, despite its low but significant toxicity.Twenty-Fifth Commission Directive 2000/11/EC of 10 March 2000 adapting to technical progress Annex II to Council Directive 76/768/EEC on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products.

=Metabolism and excretion=

In common with other nitriles, acetonitrile can be metabolised in microsomes, especially in the liver, to produce hydrogen cyanide, as was first shown by Pozzani et al. in 1959. The first step in this pathway is the oxidation of acetonitrile to glycolonitrile by an NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. The glycolonitrile then undergoes a spontaneous decomposition to give hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde. Formaldehyde, a toxin and a carcinogen on its own, is further oxidized to formic acid, which is another source of toxicity.
The metabolism of acetonitrile is much slower than that of other nitriles, which accounts for its relatively low toxicity. Hence, one hour after administration of a potentially lethal dose, the concentration of cyanide in the rat brain was one-twentieth that for a propionitrile dose 60 times lower (see table).
The relatively slow metabolism of acetonitrile to hydrogen cyanide allows more of the cyanide produced to be detoxified within the body to thiocyanate (the rhodanese pathway). It also allows more of the acetonitrile to be excreted unchanged before it is metabolised. The main pathways of excretion are by exhalation and in the urine.
