History

The Romans built a wooden bridge across the Meuse in what is now Maastricht, in approximately AD 50,. the Catholic church encouraged its construction by providing indulgences to people who helped build it.
The bridge was renovated in 1680, and in 1825 a wooden strutwork section on the east side of the bridge was replaced by a stone arch.. In 1850, as part of the construction of the Maastricht-Li√®ge Canal, a channel was cut on the west side of the bridge.
When in the early 1930s the bridge had been relieved of its function as the city's only river crossing by the construction of the Wilhelmina bridge, 
During World War II the bridge was severely damaged by the German army as they retreated from the Netherlands in 1944, but it was rebuilt in 1948..
In 1968 the bridge was illustrated on a Dutch postage stamp..
