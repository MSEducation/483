While agriculture was the main economic force, starting in the middle 18th Century home cotton production provided another source of income.  In the 19th Century two other industries came to Lupfig, straw goods manufacturing and stone cutting (from about 1880 until 1940) for the watch industry.  In 1936, the regional airport was opened at Birrfeld.
