[[Hiragana]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese writing system terms, Kana

 is a Japanese syllabary, one basic component of the Japanese writing system, along with katakana, kanji, and in some cases r≈çmaji (the Latin-script alphabet). 
Hiragana and katakana are both kana systems; they have corresponding character sets in which each kana, or character, represents one mora (one sound in the Japanese language). Each kana is either a vowel such as "a" (hiragana „ÅÇ); a consonant followed by a vowel such as "ka" (hiragana „Åã); or "n" (hiragana „Çì), a nasal sonorant which, depending on the context, sounds either like English m, n, or ng (  
Hiragana is used to write native words for which there are no kanji, including grammatical particles such as , are written in hiragana, often following a verb or adjective root (here, "È£ü") that is written in kanji. When Hiragana is used to show the pronunciation of kanji characters as reading aid, it is referred to as furigana. The article Japanese writing system discusses in detail how the various systems of writing are used.
There are two main systems of ordering hiragana, the old-fashioned iroha ordering, and the more prevalent goj≈´on ordering.

The modern hiragana syllabary consists of 46 characters:
These are conceived as a 5√ó10 grid (goj≈´on, , lit. "Fifty Sounds"), as illustrated in the adjacent table, with the extra character being the anomalous singular consonant „Çì (N). 
Romanisation of the kana does not always strictly follow the consonant-vowel scheme laid out in the table. For example, „Å°, nominally ti, is very often romanised as chi in an attempt to better represent the actual sound in Japanese.
These basic characters can be modified in various ways. By adding a dakuten marker (¬†„Çõ), a voiceless consonant is turned into a voiced consonant: k‚Üíg, ts/s‚Üíz, t‚Üíd, h‚Üíb and ch/sh‚Üíj. Hiragana beginning with an h can also add a handakuten marker (¬†„Çú) changing the h to a p.
A small version of the hiragana for ya, yu or yo („ÇÉ, „ÇÖ or „Çá respectively) may be added to hiragana ending in i. This changes the i vowel sound to a glide (palatalization) to a, u or o. Addition of the small y kana is called y≈çon. For example, „Åç (ki) plus „ÇÉ (small ya) becomes  (kya).
A small tsu „Å£, called a sokuon, indicates that the following consonant is geminated (doubled). For example, compare  Ouch!).  However, it cannot be used to double the na, ni, nu, ne, no syllables' consonants ‚Äì to double them, the singular n („Çì) is added in front of the syllable.
Hiragana usually spells long vowels with the addition of a second vowel kana. The ch≈çonpu (long vowel mark) („Éº) used in katakana is rarely used with hiragana, for example in the word  nee). Standard and voiced iteration marks are written in hiragana as „Çù and „Çû respectively.

Table of hiragana

The following table shows the complete hiragana together with the Hepburn romanization and IPA transcription in the goj≈´on order. Hiragana with dakuten or handakuten follow the goj≈´on kana without them, with the y≈çon kana following. Obsolete and normally unused kana are shown in gray. For all syllables besides „Çì, the pronunciation indicated is for word-initial syllables, for mid-word pronunciations see below.
In the middle of words, the g sound (normally .
Additionally, the j sound (normally  'number'.
In archaic forms of Japanese, there existed the kwa () digraphs. In modern Japanese, these phonemes have been phased out of usage and only exist in the extended katakana digraphs for approximating foreign language words.
The singular n is pronounced  after the vowel i if another vowel, palatal approximant or consonant s, sh, h, f or w follows.
In kanji readings, the diphthongs ou and ei are today usually pronounced  'is doing'.

Spelling rules

With a few exceptions for sentence particles „ÅØ, „Çí, and „Å∏ (pronounced as wa, o, and e), and a few other arbitrary rules, Japanese, when written in kana, is phonemically orthographic, i.e. there is a one-to-one correspondence between kana characters and sounds, leaving only words' pitch accent unrepresented. This has not always been the case: a previous system of spelling, now referred to as historical kana usage, differed substantially from pronunciation; the three above-mentioned exceptions in modern usage are the legacy of that system. The old spelling is referred to as .
There are two hiragana pronounced ji („Åò and „Å¢) and two hiragana pronounced zu („Åö and „Å•), but to distinguish them, sometimes „Å¢ is written as di and „Å• is written as dzu. These pairs are not interchangeable. Usually, ji is written as „Åò and zu is written as „Åö. There are some exceptions. If the first two syllables of a word consist of one syllable without a dakuten and the same syllable with a dakuten, the same hiragana is used to write the sounds.  For example chijimeru ('to boil down' or 'to shrink') is spelled „Å°„Å¢„ÇÅ„Çã and tsudzuku ('to continue') is  in hiragana.
However, this does not apply when kanji are used phonetically to write words which do not relate directly to the meaning of the kanji (see also ateji).  The Japanese word for 'lightning', for example, is inazuma ( is used.
Officially, „Å¢ and „Å• do not occur word-initially pursuant to modern spelling rules. There were words such as  zuke (a sushi term for lean tuna soaked in soy sauce) are examples of word-initial „Å• today. Some people write the word for hemorrhoids as „Å¢ (normally „Åò) for emphasis.
No standard Japanese words begin with the kana „Çì (n). This is the basis of the word game shiritori. „Çì n is normally treated as its own syllable and is separate from the other n-based kana (na, ni etc.). A notable exception to this wakaranu).
„Çì is sometimes directly followed by a vowel (a, i, u, e or o) or a palatal approximant (ya, yu or yo). These are clearly distinct from the na, ni etc. syllables, and there are minimal pairs such as 
There are a few hiragana which are rarely used. „Çê wi and „Çë we are obsolete outside of Okinawan dialects. „Çî vu  is a modern addition used to represent the /v/ sound in foreign languages such as English, but since Japanese from a phonological standpoint does not have a /v/ sound, it is pronounced as /b/ and mostly serves as a more accurate indicator of a word's pronunciation in its original language. However, it is rarely seen because loanwords and transliterated words are usually written in katakana, where the corresponding character would be written as „É¥. 
The  and claims it is the only occurrence amongst pure Japanese words. Its katakana counterpart is used in many loanwords, however.

History

Hiragana developed from man'y≈çgana, Chinese characters used for their pronunciations, a practice which started in the 5th century. This sword is thought to be made in year of  (which is A.D. 471 in commonly accepted theory).Seeley (2000:19-23)
The forms of the hiragana originate from the cursive script style of Chinese calligraphy. The figure below shows the derivation of hiragana from many≈çgana via cursive script. The upper part shows the character in the regular script form, the center character in red shows the cursive script form of the character, and the bottom shows the equivalent hiragana. Note also that the cursive script forms are not strictly confined to those in the illustration.
320px|right When they were first developed, hiragana were not accepted by everyone. The educated or elites preferred to use only the kanji system. Historically, in Japan, the regular script (kaisho) form of the characters was used by men and called   For example, The Tale of Genji and other early novels by female authors used hiragana extensively or exclusively.
Male authors came to write literature using hiragana. Hiragana was used for unofficial writing such as personal letters, while katakana and Chinese were used for official documents. In modern times, the usage of hiragana has become mixed with katakana writing. Katakana is now relegated to special uses such as recently borrowed words (i.e., since the 19th century), names in transliteration, the names of animals, in telegrams, and for emphasis.
Originally, for all syllables there was more than one possible hiragana. In 1900, the system was simplified so each syllable had only one hiragana. The deprecated hiragana are now known as .
The pangram poem Iroha-uta ("ABC song/poem"), which dates to the 10th century, uses every hiragana once (except n „Çì, which was just a variant of „ÇÄ before Muromachi era).

Unicode

Hiragana was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0.
The Unicode block for Hiragana is U+3040 ... U+309F.  Grey areas indicate non-assigned code points:
The Unicode hiragana block contains precomposed characters for all hiragana in the modern set, including small vowels and y≈çon kana for compound syllables, plus the archaic „Çê wi and „Çë we and the rare „Çî vu; the archaic õÄÅ ye is included in plane 1 at U+1B001 (see below). All combinations of hiragana with dakuten and handakuten used in modern Japanese are available as precomposed characters, and can also be produced by using a base hiragana followed by the combining dakuten and handakuten characters (U+3099 and U+309A, respectively). This method is used to add the diacritics to kana that are not normally used with them, for example applying the dakuten to a pure vowel or the handakuten to a kana not in the h-group.
Characters U+3095 and U+3096 are small „Åã (ka) and small „Åë (ke), respectively.  U+309F is a ligature of „Çà„Çä (yori) occasionally used in vertical text. U+309B and U+309C are spacing (non-combining) equivalents to the combining dakuten and handakuten characters, respectively.
Historic and variant forms of Japanese kana characters were added to the Unicode Standard in October, 2010 with the release of version 6.0.
The Unicode block for Kana Supplement is U+1B000 ... U+1B0FF.  Grey areas indicate non-assigned code points:
