Guatemala is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists and media workers in Latin America. 
The end of the civil war made the Guatemalan press "free" in several aspects; newspapers began to publish articles about government corruption, a topic that was frequently avoided during the war-time era, in increasing numbers. Despite these improvements, journalists in Guatemala learned to adopt a culture of self-censorship that dates back to the civil war.
