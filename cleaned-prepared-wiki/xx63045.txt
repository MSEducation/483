[[Severe thunderstorm warning]]

CATEGORIES: Weather warnings and advisories

A severe thunderstorm warning (SAME code: SVR) is issued when trained storm spotters or a Doppler weather radar indicate that a thunderstorm is producing dangerously large hail or high winds, capable of causing significant damage. In the United States, these warnings do not account for lightning, a significant hazard in any thunderstorm, or flooding caused by a thunderstorm's extreme rainfall (a flood advisory or flash flood warning is issued in these cases). A similar warning is issued by Environment Canada's Meteorological Service of Canada from their offices in Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Dartmouth. Skywarn issues the warnings for the United Kingdom.

Definition

In the U.S., the National Weather Service defines a severe thunderstorm as having large hail of at least one inch (2.5 cm), severe (storm-force) winds of 58 miles per hour (93 km/h) or greater, one or more tornadoes (though this would result in the issuance of a tornado warning), or any combination of the those criteria. In Canada, a severe thunderstorm is defined as having wind gusts of >90 km/h (56 mph), hail with a diameter of >20 mm (0.8 inch), rainfall of >50 mm (2 inches) in an hour or >75 mm (3 inches) in three hours, or tornadoes.
A severe thunderstorm warning means there is significant danger for the warned area. Occasionally, severe thunderstorms can and do produce a tornado without warning. While not all severe thunderstorms produce tornadoes, they can produce serious straight line wind damage as severe as a tornado (and can actually cover a much wider area than a tornado). If a tornado is detected on radar or is sighted, a tornado warning will be issued either in replacement of or concurrently to the existing severe thunderstorm warning. Generally, but not always, a severe thunderstorm watch or tornado watch will precede a warning.
If a tornado warning is issued, based on Doppler weather radar, it means strong rotation has been detected. Usually if a severe thunderstorm is producing weak rotation, it will only be a severe thunderstorm warning; however, the public will usually be advised that this rotation has been detected, and the storm should be watched closely. In the United States, local National Weather Service forecast offices, particularly those in the Great Plains or Southeastern U.S., sometimes include the wording "Severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes with no advance warning..." or a similar reference in their severe thunderstorm warning products, usually when there is a tornado threat or especially when a tornado watch is in effect, though sometimes the wording is included even if the threat of severe weather does not include a threat of tornadic activity.
Some storms, especially in the Great Plains, may produce massive hailstones the size of baseballs () or larger, falling fast enough to potentially kill a person by repeated blunt trauma.
In the United States, local offices of the National Weather Service issue warnings for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms based on the path of a storm. Warnings were issued on a per-county basis before October 2007, and are usually delineated on maps in polygon shapes and in text by a section of a county, although entire counties are sometimes included, especially if they are small. Storm Prediction Center and National Weather Service products as well as severe weather alert displays used by some U.S. television stations highlight severe thunderstorm warnings with a yellow or orange polygon or filled county/parish outline.
