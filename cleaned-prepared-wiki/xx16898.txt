[[Diphthong]]

CATEGORIES: Vowels, Phonetics

A diphthong (, diphthongos, literally "two sounds" or "two tones"), also known as a gliding vowel, refers to two adjacent vowel sounds occurring within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets: that is, the tongue (and/or other parts of the speech apparatus) moves during the pronunciation of the vowel. For most dialects of English, the phrase "no highway cowboys" contains five distinct diphthongs.
Diphthongs contrast with monophthongs, where the tongue or other speech organs do not move significantly and the syllable contains only a single vowel sound.  Where two adjacent vowel sounds occur in different syllables—for example, in the English word re-elect—the result is described as hiatus, not as a diphthong.
Diphthongs often form when separate vowels are run together in rapid speech during a conversation. However, there are also unitary diphthongs, as in the English examples above, which are heard by listeners as single-vowel sounds (phonemes).definition of 'Diphthong' on SIL International, accessed 17 January 2008

International Phonetic Alphabet

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, monophthongs are transcribed with one symbol, as in English sun . The two vowel symbols are chosen to represent the beginning and ending positions of the tongue, though this can be only approximate.
The non-syllabic diacritic (the inverted breve below: )FileFormat. It is, however, usually omitted in languages such as English, where there is not likely to be any confusion.
Without the diacritic, the sequence ).

Types

Falling and rising

Falling (or descending) diphthongs start with a vowel quality of higher prominence (higher pitch or volume) and end in a semivowel with less prominence, like  (see semivowel for examples).

Closing, opening, and centering

In closing diphthongs, the second element is more close than the first (e.g.  are true falling diphthongs, since they begin louder and with higher pitch and fall in prominence during the diphthong.
A third, rare type of diphthong that is neither opening nor closing is height-harmonic diphthongs, with both elements at the same vowel height..
A centering diphthong is one that begins with a more peripheral vowel and ends with a more central one, such as ).
Diphthongs may contrast in how far they open or close. For example, Samoan contrasts low-to-mid with low-to-high diphthongs:

Length

Languages differ in the length of diphthongs, measured in terms of morae.  In languages with phonemically short and long vowels, diphthongs typically behave like long vowels, and are pronounced with a similar length.  For example, in Icelandic, both monophthongs and diphthongs are pronounced long before single consonants and short before most consonant clusters.
Some languages contrast short and long diphthongs.  In some languages, such as Old English, these behave like short and long vowels, occupying one and two morae, respectively.  In other languages, however, such as Ancient Greek, they occupy two and three morae, respectively, with the first element rather than the diphthong as a whole behaving as a short or long vowel.

Difference from a vowel and semivowel

While there are a number of similarities, diphthongs are not the same as a combination of a vowel and an approximant or glide.  Most importantly, diphthongs are fully contained in the syllable nucleus

Examples

Germanic languages

=English=

All English diphthongs are falling, apart from .
In words coming from Middle English, most cases of the Modern English diphthongs .

=Dutch=

The dialect of Hamont (in Limburg) has five centring diphthongs and contrasts long and short forms of 

=German=

==Standard German==

Phonemic diphthongs in German:
In the varieties of German that vocalize the  'I hear'. These phonetic diphthongs may be as follows:

==Bernese German==

The diphthongs of some German dialects differ a lot from standard German diphthongs. The Bernese German diphthongs, for instance, correspond rather to the Middle High German diphthongs than to standard German diphthongs:
Apart from these phonemic diphthongs, Bernese German has numerous phonetic diphthongs due to L-vocalization in the syllable coda, for instance the following ones:

=Yiddish=

Yiddish has three diphthongs:
Diphthongs may reach a higher target position (towards ) in situations of coarticulatory phenomena or when words with such vowels are being emphasized.

=Norwegian=

There are five diphthongs in Norwegian:
An additional diphthong, , occurs only in the word hui in the expression i hui og hast "in great haste". The number and form of diphthongs vary between dialects.

=Faroese=

Diphthongs in Faroese are:

=Icelandic=

Diphthongs in Icelandic are the following:
Combinations of semivowel  and a vowel are the following:

Romance languages

=French=

In French, 
Diphthongs
Semivowels

==Quebec French==

In Quebec French, long vowels are normally diphthongized in informal speech when stressed.

=Catalan=

Catalan possesses a number of phonetic diphthongs, all of which begin (rising diphthongs) or end (falling diphthongs) in 
In standard Eastern Catalan, rising diphthongs (that is, those starting with ) are only possible in the following contexts:Institut d'Estudis Catalans Els diftongs, els triftongs i els hiats – Gramàtica de la Llengua Catalana (provisional draft)
There are also certain instances of compensatory diphthongization in the Majorcan dialect so that 

=Portuguese=

The Portuguese diphthongs are formed by the labio-velar approximant 
In addition, phonetic diphthongs are formed in most Brazilian Portuguese dialects by the vocalization of  ('ten years').

=Spanish=

Phonemically, Spanish has seven falling diphthongs and eight rising diphthongs.  In addition, during fast speech, sequences of vowels in hiatus become diphthongs wherein one becomes non-syllabic (unless they are the same vowel, in which case they fuse together) as in poeta 

=Italian=

The diphthongs of Italian are:
In general, unstressed 

=Romanian=

Romanian has two diphthongs:   are restricted to the syllable boundary and therefore, strictly speaking, do not form diphthongs.

Celtic languages

=Irish=

All Irish diphthongs are falling.

=Scottish Gaelic=

There are 9 diphthongs in Scottish Gaelic.  Group 1 occur anywhere (eu is usually eː before -m, e.g. Seumas).  Group 2 are reflexes that occur before -ll, -m, -nn, -bh, -dh, -gh and -mh.
For more detailed explanations of Gaelic diphthongs see Scottish Gaelic orthography.

=Cornish=

The following diphthongs are used in the Standard Written Form of Cornish.  Each diphthong is given with its Revived Middle Cornish (RMC) and Revived Late Cornish (RLC) pronunciation.

=Welsh=

Welsh is traditionally divided into Northern and Southern dialects. In the north, some diphthongs may be short or long according to regular vowel length rules but in the south they are always short (see Welsh phonology). Southern dialects tend to simplify diphthongs in speech (e.g. gwaith /gwaiθ/ is reduced to /gwaːθ/.

Slavic languages

=Serbo-Croatian=

is conventionally considered a diphthong. However, it is actually .
Some Serbo-Croatian dialects also have uo, as in kuonj, ruod, uon whereas, in Standard Croatian and Serbian, these words are konj, rod, on.

=Czech=

There are three diphthongs in Czech:
The vowel groups ia, ie, ii, io, and  iu in foreign words are not regarded as diphthongs, they are pronounced with .

Finno-Ugric languages

=Estonian=

All nine vowels can appear as the first component of an Estonian diphthong, but only  occur as the second component.
There are additional diphthongs less commonly used, such as  in näuguma (to mew).

=Finnish=

All Finnish diphthongs are falling. Notably, Finnish has true opening diphthongs (e.g.  for the genitive of näkö ('sight').

=Northern Sami=

The diphthong system in Northern Sami varies considerably from one dialect to another. The Western Finnmark dialects distinguish four different qualities of opening diphthongs:
In terms of quantity, Northern Sami shows a three-way contrast between long, short and finally stressed diphthongs. The last are distinguished from long and short diphthongs by a markedly long and stressed second component. Diphthong quantity is not indicated in spelling.

Semitic languages

=Maltese=

Maltese has seven falling diphthongs, though they may be considered VC sequences phonemically.

Sino-Tibetan languages

=Mandarin Chinese=

Rising sequences in Mandarin are usually regarded as a combination of a medial semivowel () plus a vowel, while falling sequences are regarded as one diphthong.
However, the four rising sequences below can be considered diphthongs as they are analogous to  respectively and the bare vowel nucleus mostly only occurs along with the corresponding medial.

=Cantonese=

Cantonese has eleven diphthongs.

Tai–Kadai languages

=Thai=

In addition to vowel nuclei following or preceding 

Mon-Khmer languages

=Vietnamese=

Vietnamese has a fairly large number of diphthongs:

=Khmer=

Khmer language similarly has rich vocalics with an extra distinction of long and short register to the vowels and diphthongs.

Bantu languages

=Zulu=

Zulu has only monophthongs. Y and w are semi-vowels:
