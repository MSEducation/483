History

Long Hill was originally and entirely settled as a part of Stratford, Connecticut, settled in 1639. By the mid-1650s, the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation began to petition the Court of the Colony of Connecticut for compensation for lost territory taken by the encroaching English settlement at Stratford. This legal action led the court to set the town boundary on May 15, 1656 to include all of the territory  inland from Long Island Sound between the Housatonic River and the Fairfield town line, including all of Long Hill. 1 p. 281
The English continued to purchase territory from the Native Americans entering the deeds of transfer into the land records. In April 1662, Lt. Joseph Judson, Joseph Hawley and John Minor, secured the last written deed of transfer from the Paugussett Indian Nation for the entire western part of Trumbull, referred to simply as the; Long Hill purchase. 1 p. 25 Land on Long Hill was granted to individuals shortly after 1662.

Main Street

The road from Long Hill to Stevenson was chartered as a turnpike in May 1826 and was formally known as the Monroe and Zoar Bridge Turnpike. At that time, the road from Bridgeport to Trumbull was already a toll road known as the Bridgeport and Newtown Turnpike, connecting its namesake towns and had been in operation since 1801.
In 1922, the former Monroe and Zoar Bridge Turnpike (more commonly known as simply the Monroe Turnpike) became part of the Connecticut state highway system. It was given the designation State Highway 308 and ran from modern Route 25 to modern Route 34. The continuation into Bridgeport, which would later become Route 25, was at the time part of State Highway 122.
Modern Route 111, Main Street, was created in the 1932 state highway renumbering from old State Highway 308 and was previously called Long Hill Street. In 1982, with the opening of the Route 25 freeway, the former southern section of Route 25 within Trumbull was reassigned to Route 111, while the portion in Bridgeport reverted to the town.Connecticut Routes, Route 111
