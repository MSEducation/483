Biography

Born in Tokyo, Sakamoto grew up within a family of her parents and her older brother.[ref]
 
In 1996, she was given the role of Hitomi Kanzaki in the TV anime series The Vision of Escaflowne in 1996. In this anime she also made her debut as a singer under the production of Yoko Kanno, who was in charge of the soundtrack of the same anime. Under Kanno's production she made her debut as a singer with "Yakusoku wa Iranai", her first single released on April 24, 1996 that was also used as Escaflowne's opening theme. Since then, she would start singing music for several anime series she would be working on as a voice actress, with its production being exclusively in charge of Yoko Kanno and her music crew, which includes a selected number of lyricists and composers, as Yūho Iwasato, Gabriela Robin, Shanti Snyder, Tim Jensen and a few others. For her singing career she would be working almost exclusively with Yoko Kanno for almost a decade. In October 1996 she began her first radio program on Nack 5, becoming a radio personality. Her first album, entitled Grapefruit, was released on April 23, 1997. 
In 2003 she made her debut as an actress in the Japanese version of Les Misérables, in which she played Éponine Thénardier. She starred the TV drama Suekko Chnan Ane San-nin, and also played the leading role in the short film 03+. This year also, her single "Tune the Rainbow" became her first Top 10 single in Japan, peaking at number 9 in the Oricon weekly charts. On October 12 of this same year, Sakamoto's fourth album Shōnen Alice was released, which became her first Top 10 album, and also her last one to be produced exclusively by Yoko Kanno, for after this she would start to become more involved in the music making process and the production of her records. Thus, Yūnagi Loop, her fifth album  released on October 26, 2005, was co-produced by herself and musician Mistuyoshi Tamura, whom she would continue working in her subsequent records. The album's lead single "Loop" peaked at number seven in the Japanese charts, becoming her highest chart peaking single at that time.
In 2008, Sakamoto and Kanno worked together again in "Triangler", song that was used as opening theme for the TV anime series Macross Frontier. "Triangler" was a massive success, becoming a Top 3 single in the Oricon charts, and also her biggest selling single to date. The song was later included in Sakamoto's sixth album, Kazeyomi, which was released January 2009. For promoting this album, Sakamoto began her first low-scale national tour, on which she held a three concerts at the Nagoya City Art Theatre, the Osaka Welfare Pension Hall and the Tokyo International Forum. The tour was later released as her first live DVD on August 11, 2011.
In 2010, she celebrated her 15th anniversary in the industry releasing the greatest hits album Everywhere, and also giving a concert at the Nippon Budokan both on March 31,  the day of her 30th birthday. In 2011, her seventh album You Can't Catch Me became the first number one record of her career in Japan.
Her 2012 Mitsubachi tour concluded with an announcement at her New Year's Eve concert of a new full-length album of songs written and composed solely by Sakamoto, as well as a short concert tour to support it. The album, titled Singer Song Writer, will feature two new versions of Sakamoto's previous compositions "everywhere" and "Chikai" as well as eight original tracks. 

Collaborations

Sakamoto first teamed up with composer Yoko Kanno in her 1996 debut single, "Yakusoku wa Iranai" ("Promises Not Needed"), which was used as the opening theme for the anime series The Vision of Escaflowne.

Sakamoto also performed three songs for the series Wolf's Rain, for which Kanno was the composer: "Gravity" (which is sung completely in English), "Tell Me What The Rain Knows" (with lyrics by Chris Mosdell) and "Cloud 9". She performed "Hemisphere", the opening theme of the series RahXephon, as well as two songs for the series' theatrical version RahXephon: Pluralitas Concentio: "Tune the Rainbow" and "The Garden of Everything" (duet with Steve Conte).
