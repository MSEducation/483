Zygoballus is a genus of jumping spiders found in North and South America.

Taxonomy and history

The genus was first described in 1885 by American arachnologists George and Elizabeth Peckham based on the type species Zygoballus rufipes.
The genus Messua, based on the type species Messua desidiosa, was synonymized with Zygoballus by Eugène Simon in 1903. Simon argued that Messua desidiosa was a transitional species which differed "much less from typical Zygoballus than would seem to be indicated by Peckham's description."
The genus Amerotritte, based on the type species Amerotritte lineata, was synonymized with Zygoballus in 1980 by María Elena Galiano. Galiano stated that the holotype of Amerotritte lineata was actually a very young Zygoballus specimen.
Zygoballus is currently classified in the subfamily Dendryphantinae of the family Salticidae (jumping spiders).

Description

Spiders of the genus Zygoballus share a strong resemblance in appearance. Males have obliquely oriented chelicerae with long fangs.
Many species exhibit wide variation in color, size, and markings.

Distribution

Zygoballus is a genus from the New World, ranging from Argentina to Canada. Three species from India were originally placed in Zygoballus, but have been reassigned to other genera.

Species

As of 2010, twenty recognized species are classified in the genus Zygoballus. Several other species are known only from single specimens. In addition to the species listed below, a recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that Rhetenor texanus may also belong in Zygoballus.
