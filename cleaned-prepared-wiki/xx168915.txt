Tomasz Witold Drwal (born January 22, 1982) is a Polish mixed martial artist from Nowy Sącz. Drwal was a dominating light heavyweight fighter in Europe, gathering a record of 14–1 in various European MMA promotions before he signed a contract with the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

Career

Ultimate Fighting Championship

He lost his UFC debut against Thiago Silva at UFC 75 on September 8, 2007.
He returned to action after knee surgery at UFC 93 in January 2009 and defeated the debuting Ivan Serati via KO in the first round.
His next fight was a first round TKO over Mike Ciesnolevicz on the TUF 9 Finale on June 20, 2009 (a replacement for injured Eric Schafer).
Moving down to middleweight, he defeated Drew McFedries at UFC 103 in the second round by rear naked choke submission.
Drwal faced Rousimar Palhares on March 27, 2010 at UFC 111, losing after an early slip via heel hook submission which appeared to injure Drwal. Palhares was subsequently suspended for 90 days for continuing to apply pressure to the lock after the referee intervened. In fact, the heel hook caused no bone fractures, which is to be expected since heel hooks are a danger to ankle and knee ligaments, as well as knee cartilage, not bones.
Drwal then fought David Branch on September 15, 2010 at UFC Fight Night 22.  (in Polish)

Post-UFC

Tomasz returned to his winning ways knocking out Leonardo Lucio Nascimento at FAŁ 2 in his native Poland. His next fights were for new Polish promotion called MMA Attack, in which to this point he had two fights, against Gary Padilla and Wes Swofford, and all of them he won, respectively by unanimous decision and submission via armbar in 1st round.

Personal life

Drwal runs his own gym in Poland, the "Change Gym", but trains also at Alliance Training Center in San Diego before his fights.
