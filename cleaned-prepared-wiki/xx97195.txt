Episode Six was a British pop-rock group active during the mid-1960s. The band did not have commercial success in the U.K, releasing nine singles that all failed to chart, The group is best known today for being the band that Ian Gillan and Roger Glover left in 1969 to join Deep Purple.

Career

The band was formed in Hatch End, then in Middlesex, in July 1964
By 1965, the band had signed a management deal with Gloria Bristow, a former employee of Helmut Gordon, original manager of what became The Who. In April of that year, the band were offered a short residency at the Arcadia Club in Frankfurt, Germany, playing from 7pm to 3am every night for a month, with only 15 minutes' break every hour. Immediately on their return, Ross decided to get married and quit the music business, and cut their first single, The Hollies' "Put Yourself In My Place" before the end of the year. It was released in early 1966.
The band were booked by Radio London to appear at one of their big open-air summer shows in May 1966 alongside David Bowie and issued more singles during the year, all of which failed to chart.
The group had by now built up an impressive repertoire of covers and originals and would vary their sets according to the audiences. They were also beginning to do sessions for the BBC. They did a mini tour of London parks (organised by the Greater London Council) in mid-June 1967, performing two 45 minute sets, and played for four weeks in Germany.
The group got a new record deal with MGM Records and shortened their name to The Episode, releasing "Little One" in May 1968 (their only single under the new name). They did three UK TV shows to promote this and recorded dozens of tracks for radio sessions over the year, including the new Radio 1 Club.), who was eventually fired, replaced by ex-Outlaws drummer Mick Underwood.
The group left MGM and signed with Chapter One records, releasing 'Lucky Sunday' in September 1968, which became their eighth single to fail to chart in the U.K. Gillan hated the brass section on the record. "Mozart Vs The Rest" followed in February 1969. This was issued in response to hundreds of calls to BBC Radio 1 after the band performed it on air. Sadly this happened too late for it to chart.
The band decided they needed to update their musical style from the pop-rock they had been playing into a heavier sound, and made a start on a d√©but album but it was never finished.
Episode Six carried on for a time with John Gustafson on bass and vocals. Sheila rehearsed with Pete Robinson, John Gustafson and Mick Underwood as a quartet, before they formed the trio Quatermass. Episode Six then played for a while with Sheila, Tony Lander, Dave Lawson (later of Greenslade) and Tony Dangerfield on bass. By the end of the year they were billed as Episode Six with Sheila Carter and then The Sheila Carter Band, and this continued off and on (mostly with gigs abroad) until 1974 with Sheila as the constant, before she went into session work.
A couple of singles recorded by Episode Six for Pye Records have been produced by Tony Reeves, a renowned bassist and one of founder members of Colosseum.
