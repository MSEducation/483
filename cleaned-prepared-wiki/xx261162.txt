[[2011 Cannes Film Festival]]

CATEGORIES: Cannes Film Festival, 2011 in France, 2011 film festivals

The 64th annual Cannes Film Festival was held from 11 to 22 May 2011.
Midnight in Paris, written and directed by Woody Allen, opened the festival.
Italian film director Bernardo Bertolucci was presented with the inaugural Honorary Palme d'Or Award at the opening ceremony of the festival.
Danish film director Lars von Trier caused controversy with comments he made at the press conference of his film Melancholia. When he was asked about the relation between the influences of German Romanticism in the film and his own German heritage, the director made jokes about Jews and Nazis. He said he understood Adolf Hitler and admired the work of architect Albert Speer, and jokingly announced that he was a Nazi.

Palme d'Or

Winner

The Palme d'Or was won by the American film The Tree of Life directed by Terrence Malick. The Tree of Life is the first American film to win the Palme d'Or since Fahrenheit 9/11 in 2004. Head of the jury, Robert De Niro, said it was difficult to choose a winner, but The Tree of Life "ultimately fit the bill". De Niro explained, "It had the size, the importance, the intention, whatever you want to call it, that seemed to fit the prize."
