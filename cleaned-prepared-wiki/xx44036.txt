The Toyota Celica  is a sports compact car which was produced by the Japanese company Toyota from 1970 to 2006. The Celica name was ultimately derived from the Latin word coelica meaning "heavenly" or "celestial". In Japan, the Celica was exclusive to Toyota Japanese dealerships Toyota Corolla Store.
Throughout its life span the Celica has been powered by various four-cylinder engines.  The most significant change occurred in August 1985, when the car's drive layout was changed from rear wheel drive to front wheel drive.  During the first three generations, American market Celicas were powered by various versions of Toyota's R series engines. The four-wheel drive turbocharged model called GT-Four worldwide (All-Trac Turbo in the US) was produced from 1986 to 1999. Variable Valve Timing came in certain Japanese models starting in December 1997, and became standard in all models from 2000 on. Through seven generations, the model has gone through many revisions and design forks, including the Toyota Celica Supra (later known as the Toyota Supra). The Celica was available as notchback and liftback coupes, as well as a convertible.

First generation / A20/35 Series (1970–1977) 

Displayed at the October 1970 Tokyo Motor Show and marketed in December of the same year, the Celica was a personal car that emphasized styling and driving enjoyment. Japanese models were originally ET, LT, ST, and GT. The platform was shared with the Toyota Carina, a vehicle exclusive to Toyota Store Japanese dealerships. The Celica filled a market position previously held by the 1965–1969 Toyota Sports 800, when Toyota Corolla Store locations were previously known as Toyota Public Store, then renamed in 1966 as Toyota Corolla Store.
For export markets, the Celica was offered in three different levels of trim; LT, ST and GT.
At its introduction the Celica was only available as a pillarless hardtop notchback coupe, adopting "coke bottle styling". The SV-1 liftback was shown as a concept car at the 1971 Tokyo Motor Show. With slight modifications, this was introduced in Japan in April 1973 as the 2-liter RA25 and 1.600 L TA27 liftbacks. It was then exported to Europe in RHD form as the 1.6-liter liftback. After the October 1975 facelift, it was available in both RHD and LHD forms in other markets. The RV-1 wagon was also shown at the 1971 Tokyo Motor Show but it did not reach production.
The Japanese GT models had various differences from the ET, LT and ST including the hood flutes, power windows, air conditioning, and specific GT trim, but shared a few things with the ST – a full-length center console and oil pressure/ammeter gauges while the LT had warning lights for these functions. With the exception of the American market, the GT had a twincam engine (1600 cc 2T-G or 2000 cc 18R-G, not available on the ET, LT or ST) and always had 5 speed manual gearboxes. For the American market only, the GT had only a single cam engine (2000 cc 18R or 2200 cc 20R) with a choice of automatic or manual gearboxes.
There was also the GTV version, which introduced in 1972 with slightly less luxurious interior than the GT. The GTV came with firmer suspension for better handling.
The first generation Celicas can be further broken down into two distinctive models. The first of these was the original with slant nose (trapezoid-like shape front corner light). This is for Coupe model only, TA22, RA20, and RA21. These models were released from 1970 to 1975 and came equipped with the 2T, 2T-G 1.6-liter, or 18R 2.0-liter motor. They had a  wheelbase). This facelift model appeared in Japan in 1974, but for export was the 1976 model year. The Japanese version had engines under 2.0 liters so as to conform to Japanese regulations concerning engine displacement size, thereby allowing buyers to avoid an additional tax for a larger engine.
In some markets, the lower-end LT was equipped with the single carbureted four-cylinder 2T engine displacing 1,600 cc, while the ST came with a twin downdraft-carburetor 2T-B engine. The 2T-G that powered the high-end GT model was a DOHC 1,600 cc engine equipped with twin Mikuni-Solex Carburetors.
The first Celica for North America, 1971 ST was powered by 1.9-liter 8R engine. The 1972–1974 models have 2.0-liter 18R-C engines. For 1975–77, the engine for the North American Celica is the 2.2-liter 20R.  The Celica GT and LT models were introduced in the U.S. for the 1974 model year.  The top-line GT included a 5-speed manual transmission, rocker panel GT stripes, and styled steel wheels with chrome trim rings.  The LT was marketed as an economy model.  Mid-1974 saw minor changes in the Celica's trim and badges and slightly different wheel arches.  The A30 automatic transmission became an option on North American ST and LT models starting in the 1973 model year.  For 1975, the 1974 body was used, but body-color plastic fascia and sturdier chrome and black rubber bumpers, replaced the chrome bumpers used in the earlier cars (in accordance with US Federal bumper laws).  Unfortunately the early 8R and 18R series engines proved to be less than durable, with early failures common.  The 1974 18R-C engine's durability was improved somewhat, but the 20R introduced for 1975 proved to be a better engine in most respects.

1972 Minor Update

In August 1972, the tail lights were updated from 1 piece tail light (affectionately called 1-tail) to tail lights with distinctive turn signals. The rear center garnish was also redesigned. The fuel tank was moved from the trunk bottom to behind the rear seats; the fuel filler was moved from a concealed location between the tail lights to the left C pillar.

Liftback

The Liftback was introduced for Japanese market in April 1973, but not until 1976 for export models. Models for home market Liftback were 1600ST, 1600GT (TA27), 2000ST, and 2000GT (RA25 and RA28). The American Liftback was only offered as GT (RA29) with a 2.2-liter 20R engine. All the Liftback models have flat noses.
Although there is no "B" pillar in the Liftback, the rear windows do not roll down (as they do in the hardtop coupe).
The Liftback was often called the "Japanese Mustang" or the "Mustang Celica" because of the styling similarities to the Ford Mustang pony car, including the triple bar tail lights that are a signature Mustang styling cue and the overall homages to the muscle-car era.

Facelift export models

In October 1975, The entire Celica lineup was given a facelift, with a revised front bumper and grille arrangement. The new model codes for facelift hardtop coupe were RA23 for general worldwide market with 18R engine, or RA24 for the American spec with 20R engine. The Liftback were coded RA28 for worldwide or RA29 for US. Also available was the TA23, which was similar to the RA23, but with the 2T engine. The RA23 and RA28 had a more distinctive bulge hood, which was lacking in the TA22 or RA20 Coupe and in the TA27 and RA25 Liftback Celica. The TA22 Celica also had removable vents mounted in the hood, which the RA23 and RA28 lacked. The RA series also had an elongated nose to accommodate the larger engine.  The door vents, fuel filler cap, and interior were also different between the TA and RA series.
For 1976–1977, the non-US GT Liftback was released with the 18R-G Twincam engine with a Yamaha head and running gear. This engine produced significantly more power than the 18R-C. Peak power was about  at 6,000 rpm.
In Australia, the Celica was first released in the 1.6 L 2T motor. The later 1975–1977 Celica was released with the 2.0 L 18R motor.

Second generation (A40, A50; 1977–1981)

The second generation Celica was released for 1978 model year (production began in late 1977), and was again available in both Coupe and Liftback forms.  Interestingly, it was designed in the United States by Toyota's Calty Research Design studio in California.  The Coupe was no longer a true hardtop; both Coupe and Liftback had frameless door glass but featured a thick "B" pillar. David Stollery was responsible for its design.
From 1979 to 1981 the Griffith company in the US offered a Targa style convertible conversion to the Coupe. They were called the SunChaser and had a removable Targa top and a folding rear roof, much like the '67 Porsche 911 soft-window Targa. These were Toyota approved and sold through Toyota dealers.  Over 2000 were produced.
The second generation Celica can also be broken down into two series of release (known as Series A and Series B). These two Celicas were only distinguishable by appearance – both having the same engine capacity. The original Series A Celica (1978–1979) was released with round headlights and chrome bumpers for lower grades. The higher grades such as GT and all US models have black rubber bumpers. The facelift model Series B Celica (1979–1981) was released with square headlights, revised tail lights. They came with chrome bumpers with rubber protectors on each corners, or for certain models with all polyurethane black bumpers such on the GT and all US spec cars.
Power for North American models was provided by a 2.2 L 20R engine for both ST and GT models. Japan and other markets had 1.6-, 1.8-, and 2.0-liter powerplants. This new generation offered more safety, power and fuel economy than previous models, and was awarded Motor Trend's "Import Car of the Year" for 1978. Japanese models were ET, LT, ST, SE, XT, GT, and GTV. The GT and GTV have an 18R-G Twincam engine. In late 1978, the GTV was replaced by GT Rally.
The limited edition "US Grand Prix" GT Liftback was offered in 1980 due to Toyota's connection to the U.S. Grand Prix West in Long Beach, California. For 1981, the North American models were given a bigger engine, the 2.4-liter 22R which was simultaneously fitted to the Pickup. To celebrate the Celica 10th Anniversary, the GTA Coupe was released. This was basically a GT Coupe with a four-speed automatic transmission, Supra style interior, power windows, upgraded sound system and alloy wheels. The GTA is distinguishable by the black/gold two tone paint and a "GTA 10th anniversary" plaque on the center console.
There were about 70 different variants of second generation Celica sold in Japan over the model's life time. At its pinnacle in 1979, Toyota retailed 49 versions at once.

Celica XX / Celica Supra

In 1978 Toyota began production of the Mark I Toyota Supra in Japan, as the Toyota Celica XX. The year it debuted in the United States and Japan was in 1979. The U.S. Mark I (chassis code MA46) was originally equipped with a  2.0 L 12-valve SOHC inline-6 engine (M-EU).

Celica Camry

Toyota launched the Celica Camry, a four-door sedan, in the Japanese market during January 1980. This model was essentially a second generation 1977–1981 Toyota Carina (A40 and A50) with an elongated front-end styled to resemble the 1978–1981 Celica XX, known as the Celica Supra in export markets. Unlike other Celicas, this Carina-derived model is a four-door sedan rather than a coupé or liftback. Toyota replaced the Celica Camry upon the arrival of the front-wheel drive Toyota Camry (V10) in 1982.

Third generation / A60 Series (1981–1985)

August 1981 saw the introduction of the third generation Celica. The car was initially available in coupe and liftback forms with many buyers preferring the liftback. The US-made convertible came in 1984. Styling was changed considerably from previous models and power was provided by a 2.4 L 22R or 22R-E engine in all North American models, while smaller engines were used in other countries. The 2.4 L became the biggest 4 cylinder engine offered in any Celica ever. Other engines were the 1.6-liter 4A, 1.6-liter 2T, 1.8-liter 3T, 1.8-liter 4T, 1.8-liter 1S, 2.0-liter 2S, 2.0-liter 18R-G and 2.0-liter 21R, depending on the particular market. Trim levels are SV, ST, ST-EFI, SX, GT, and GT Rally. Rack and pinion steering was offered with this Celica.
Fuel injection became standard on all North American Celicas started from August 1982, therefore the 22R engine became 22R-EC.
In August 1982, Toyota added the GT-S model to the North American market to re-inject the sports image that Celica had lost as it grew larger and heavier with each subsequent model. The GT-S included larger 14x7" wheels and 225/60HR14 tires, fender flares, independent rear suspension, a sports interior including special seats, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter knob. Most of these came from the Supra.  This made sense as the Supra was based on the Celica.  From the windshield back, both cars were nearly identical when in liftback form.  There were also optional rear louvers for the coupe and liftback. The upgraded GT-S wheels are coveted as replacements by many people who own first generation Celicas as they remained four-lug and looked sportier than first generation wheels while still providing the "classic Celica" look and feel.  The wheels were also polished aluminium as opposed to the flat finish of the lower models.
The Celica was updated in August 1983 for the 1984 model year. The revision included fully retractable headlights, restyled grille, and airdam. The rear combination lamps were also revised. The Japanese Celica 1600 GT got new 4A-GE engine, and the 1600 GT-R also powered by the same motor was introduced. Another new model was the turbocharged 1800 GT-TR.
The GT-S Convertible, built by American Specialty Cars (ASC) in California, was originally released in a limited 200 units in 1984. 4,248 more were built for the 1985 model year.
The Australian, European, Japanese, and general export model Celicas came with rear side vents, which are highly sought after by North American Celica enthusiasts.
In Europe, the Celica was offered as 1600ST with 2T engine, 2000XT (21R), and 2000GT (18R-G).
In Australia, Toyota decided initially to use the 21R-C in the Celica. As a result the car only turned out a mere . Later versions used IRS rear suspension, rather than the traditional live axle differential.

Twincam Turbo Group B Rally Car

In September 1982, the first Celica turbo was launched in Japan for the local market only. The GT-T (TA63) came with the twin-spark 1.8-liter 3T-GTE engine, W55 5-speed manual gearbox, a limited slip differential, pump up lumbar "sports" seats and optional digital dash.
To meet the FISA regulation for Group B Rally Car to compete in the World Rally Championship (WRC), 200 units of the Celica GT-TS were built. These were the basic cars for Group B Celica Twincam Turbo (TA64) which were built and rallied by Toyota Team Europe (TTE). The Group B Celica TCT made its WRC debut in the 1983 Rally Finland. The production car had  4T-GTE engine, the fully works rally car was the most powerful third generation Celica.

Fourth generation / T160 Series (1985–1989)

In August 1985 the Celica was changed completely. It was an all-new vehicle with front wheel drive, a rounded, flowing body and new 2.0 L four-cylinder engines. The Celica was no longer built on the Toyota A platform, and instead realigned with the Toyota T platform underpinning the Toyota Corona. The Toyota A platform was now exclusive to the Toyota Supra. The coupe bodystyle in Japan was used only for the Corona Coupe, sold only at Japanese Toyota dealerships Toyopet Store without the retractable headlights. An optional feature only offered on the Corona Coupe was four-wheel steering, not shared with the Celica during this generation, however, the turbocharged engine on the Celica was not installed in the Corona Coupe.
Toyota introduced the "ultimate Celica", the GT-Four (ST165) onto the Japanese market in October 1986. With full-time all-wheel drive, including an electronically controlled central locking differential, and a turbocharged version of the GT-S 2.0 L engine producing . The All-trac system was also offered for a limited time on the Camry, and Corolla in North America without the turbo, as well as the normally aspirated and supercharged Previa.
The ST165 chassis design was quite acclaimed in its time. Toyota chose not to make any drastic suspension changes for the AWD GT-Four.
The front suspension comprises MacPherson struts with an anti-swaybar and strut tower brace, while the rear employs struts with a trailing link and twin lateral links per side plus an anti-swaybar.
The ST165 GT-Four made its World Rally debut in the 1988 Tour de Corse and finished 6th. The first victory came in 1988 Cyprus (non-WRC), and the first WRC victory in 1989 Rally Australia.

Japan

For the Japanese market the fourth generation Celica started with the 1S-iSU engine in the ST160 and 4A engine in the AT160. The 4A engine was terminated in August 1987 and the 1S-iLU engine was replaced by the 4S-Fi engine in the ST163 in May 1988. The 3S engine in various twincam forms was introduced in August 1987 in the ST162. The 3S-GTE turbo engine was also introduced at the same time in the all-wheel drive ST165 GT-Four. Two months later, a factory convertible (coded ST162C) was offered with the twincam 3S-FE engine.
Non twincam models came in ST and SX trim levels. Models with the 3S-FE economy twincam came in the ZR trim level, including the convertible. Models with the 3S-GELU sports twincam came in GT and GT-R trim levels and lastly the turbo all-wheel drive model came in the GT-Four trim level. A digital instrument panel was offered on the top level GT and GT-R. The notchback two-door coupé bodystyle was not offered as a Celica in Japan; instead this body was sold as the Toyota Corona Coupé, with fixed headlights rather than the Celica's flip-up units.

Australia

The Australian spec Celica ST162 were the base model ST with 3S-FE engine offered as Coupe and Liftback, and the top of the line SX Liftback with higher performance 3S-GE Twincam engine. Rear spoiler and alloy wheels came standard on the SX, which made it the same appearance as the Japanese GT-R or American GT-S. 
The limited edition SX White Lightning with all white bumpers, side protectors and wheels was offered in 1989. This featured cruise control (automatic models only) and the same sports seats used in the ST165 GT-Four, but was otherwise identical to the SX.

Europe

In most European countries these models were available instead:
The Convertible or better known as Cabriolet was based on the 2.0 GT. The GT-S was badged 2.0 GT-i 16.

North America

Trims available were the ST coupe or the GT and GT-S that came as a coupe or liftback; with the GT trim available as a soft-top convertible starting in the 1987 model year. The GT-Four was available as a model year 1988, 2 years after the release in Japan. All trims came standard with a tachometer, oil pressure, voltmeter (replaced with a boost meter in the ST165) gauges and a rear window defogger for the interior.
ST: The ST was the most basic form of the T160 chassis. In 1986, the chassis was designated as the ST161. It had the SOHC 8-valve, 2.0 L 2S-E engine from the Camry, producing  at 5200 rpm and 124 ft-lbs. of torque at 4400 rpm; and as a result, the chassis designation was changed to ST162. The ST was the lightest T160 chassis at 2455 lbs. with the manual transmission. A 5-speed manual was the only transmission available in 1986, with a 4-speed automatic being optional 1987 onwards, bringing the curb weight to 2522 lbs. Steel wheels were wrapped with 165/80-13 tires. The interior had manual windows and locks, bucket seats and an AM/FM receiver as standard features. Power steering and power brakes were standard, with ventilated discs in the front and drum brakes in the rear to go along with a 4x100 bolt pattern. Cable operated air-conditioning was optional.toyotareference.com/celica/1986-1989
GT: The GT shared the ST's engine as well as the chassis designation being the ST161 with a 2S-E engine in 1986 quickly changing over to the ST162 with a 3S-FE engine 1987 onwards. The curb weight was 2515 lbs for the coupe and 2546 lbs. for the liftback. A 4 speed overdrive automatic transmission (A140L) was an option, bringing the curb weight up to 2579 and 2610 lbs., respectively. The convertible weighed in at 2700 lbs. for the manual and 2760 lbs. for the automatic. For the interior, the GT came with an electronic 4 speaker AM/FM/MPX tuner, power side mirrors, tilt steering wheel, driver's lumbar support and an automatic retracting radio antenna was standard. Power locks, windows, power tilt/slide sunroof, side mirror defogger, cruise control, electronic air-conditioning, and 13"x5.5" aluminum alloy wheels were optional with  185/70-13 tires. Interestingly enough, a digital instrument panel was available as an option for the non-convertible GT trim only. The GT also includes a front strut bar across the two strut towers as an upgrade over the ST trim, but retains the front ventilated disc and rear drum brake combination from the ST. A rear window wiper/washer was introduced as an option in 1987.
GT-S: The GT-S (chassis code ST162) was given a de-tuned version of the DOHC 2.0 L engine (3S-GELC) featuring T-VIS and a 6800 rpm redline producing  at 6000 rpm and 125 ft-lbs of torque at 4800 rpm. An EGR and O2 sensor restricted the engine along with a milder ECU. The GT-S replaced the rear drum brakes with disc brakes going along with a 5x100 bolt pattern. Standard features in addition to the GT trim included an 8-way adjustable sports bucket seats with power lumbar and side bolsters, automatic climate control, side mirror defogger, wrap-around spoiler, telescopic steering wheel, and speed-rated 205/60-14 tires on 14"x6" alloy wheels. Leather interior including shift knob, door panel inserts, and steering wheel were optional. In Canada, all GT-S models were 5-speed (S53) manual transmissions, but in America, an electronic controlled 4-speed automatic (A140E) with lock-up torque converter was available. New features in 1988-1989 included an illuminated vanity light as standard and ABS as optional.
Turbo All-Trac: The turbo All-Trac (chassis code ST165), or turbo 4wd as it was named in Canada, is the American version of the GT-Four. It was given a DOHC turbo-charged, water-to-air intercooled 2.0L engine (3S-GTE) featuring T-VIS producing  at 6000 rpm and 190 ft-lbs of torque at 3200 rpm. The All-Trac only came with a 5 speed all wheel drive transmission with a viscous-coupling center differential, bringing the curb weight to 3197 lbs. The ST165 was not sold in North America before 1988 except for seventy-seven special-edition cars sold in 1987 as 1988 models at each of the 77 Toyota dealerships in California to commemorate Toyota's IMSA GTO championship win. These Celicas are all white with white wheels and blue interior and have "IMSA GTO CHAMPION" printed in small letters on the side moulding, as well as a white stripe on the grill. This top of the line trim came with the same options as the GT-S with the exception of the power interior options, leather steering wheel, fog lights, V-rated tires, and a factory full body kit as standard. One interior feature that is missing from the GT-S trim and other trims is the cup holder as the center console is different due to a larger center body tunnel to accommodate for the ST165's center drive shaft.

Fifth generation / T180 Series (1989–1993)

The fifth generation  Celica was introduced in September 1989 for the 1990 model year. The Celica received new Super Round organic styling, upgraded wheels and tires, more powerful GT-Four (US: All-Trac) with better cooling system, and for the Japanese market only, the 4-Wheel Steering (4WS) models. Toyota engineers claimed that the round styling and lack of straight edges increased strength without adding weight.  The styling was later copied by other manufacturers.  Japanese domestic market (JDM) models were now S-R, Z-R, GT-R, Active Sports (with active suspension), and GT-Four. The S-R and Z-R were powered by a 3S-FE engine, while the GT-R and Active Sports came with a 3S-GE. The 3S-GTE in the GT-Four features an air-to-air intercooler and CT26 twin entry turbo to eliminate exhaust gas interference. The JDM GT-Four has  of torque, a result of more aggressive ignition advance and ceramic turbine. The Full-time 4WD system in the GT-Four has viscous coupling limited slip center differential and Torsen rear differential.
Eddie Murphy made television commercials in Japan for the fifth-generation Celica, promoting the styling and the Super Live Sound System.
The North American Celica had fixed door mirrors and amber front corner lights. All other models had folding mirrors and front clear corner lights. Driver's side SRS Airbag is standard on all US models. The base model ST has 1.6 L 4A-FE, the GT and GT-S were powered by the 2.2 L 5S-FE.  The 1.6L was similar to the one used in the Corolla.  The GT-S was rated  torque; an increase of 10 each from the previous model.  The GT-S and all export market GT-Four are wide-body Liftbacks with flared fenders.  The JDM GT-Four was also offered as normal body for the pre-facelift model.
Trim levels for the European Celica were 1.6 ST-i, 2.0 GT-i 16, and GT-Four. The 2.0 GT-i 16 Cabriolet was offered only in certain European countries. Only the 2.0 GT-i 16 Liftback and GT-Four were officially sold in the UK. New for 1992, the wide body 2.0 GT-i 16 was offered in the Netherlands and Belgium. This was basically a GT-S with 3S-GE engine.
Models for Australia were SX Coupe, SX Liftback, GT-Four, and also 150 units limited edition GT-Four Group A Rallye. The Australian cars are less luxurious than JDM and North American models. Initially, the GT-Four did not come with ABS and fog lamps, which became standard few months after the introduction. In 1993, the Limited Edition WRC Trophy model was offered in Australia. This is basically the SX with sport front seats from the GT-Four, cruise control, rear window shade / spoiler, and special decals.
In August 1990, the wide body Liftback GT-Four A and Convertible were added into the Japanese Celica line up. Super Live Sound System with 10 speakers became standard on the GT-Four A and optional in other models except the S-R. 
The 20th Anniversary GT-R came in December 1990 to celebrate 20 years of Celica production.
The Celica Convertible was built by American Sunroof Corporation (ASC) in California. It was offered as GT in US with 5S-FE engine, and as Type G in Japan or 2.0 GT-i 16 Cabriolet in Europe with 3S-GE engine. The JDM Convertible also has 4WS. The European Celica Cabriolet retained the old style front bumper for 1992, and received the facelift in 1993.
There are three different gearboxes for ST185 GT-Four. The E150F gearbox with 4.285 final gear ratio was installed in the JDM and All-Trac. European and Australian models, as well as the RC/Carlos Sainz/Group A models, came with the E151F gearbox with 3.933 ratio. The JDM only GT-Four Rally, a limited edition lightweight rally version sold only in Japan (not to be confused with the Australian GT-Four Grp A Rallye model), has the E152F gearbox with close ratio on the 1st through 4th gear and 4.285 final ratio. It also came with steel wheels and without air conditioning, power windows, or a power antenna. The early model GT-Four Rally is based on the normal body, and the facelift model is wide body with round fog lights. Also sold in Japan only was the GT-Four V. This is an economy version of normal body without alloy wheels, leather, or System 10, but still came with fog lights, power windows, and optional sunroof. This was not sold in Australia.
Anti-lock brakes (ABS) were available on the GT-S all four years and was available on the GT from 1992 to 1993. ABS, Leather interior, Sunroof, and System 10 Premium Sound System are optional on the GT-S and '90–'92 All-Trac, and standard on '93 All-Trac. With its sport-style interior, power-operated driver's seat, auto tilt-away steering wheel, and cruise control as standard equipment, the All-Trac (known as the GT-Four outside of the US) was the most expensive Celica yet. With a 2.0 L turbocharged 3S-GTE producing , it was the most powerful Celica ever sold in the USA.
In August 1991, Toyota face-lifted the Celica for the 1992 model year. Changes included:
For the Group A homologation, the special rally edition of 5000 units named GT-Four RC was launched in Japan in September 1991. The export models are called Carlos Sainz (CS) Limited Edition in Europe (in honour of their famous WRC driver), or Group A Rallye in Australia.
Special features include:
Out of the 5000 units, 1800 stayed in Japan, 3000 for the selected European countries, 150 delivered to Australia, 25 went to Singapore, and a few were exported to New Zealand and other markets.

Sixth generation / T200 Series (1993–1999)

In October 1993, Toyota launched the sixth generation Celica for the 1994 model year.
Styling of the new Celicas was acclaimed by most publications as "Supra-esque" with four exposed headlights, and did also provide a visual resemblance to the Soarer introduced in 1991. Celicas were available in either notchback Coupe or Liftback form, the Convertible would came later. New safety equipment in the form of driver (and then later passenger) airbags were standard, and anti-lock brakes were available on all models.  Many Celicas also sported CFC-free air conditioning.
For the US market, the Celica was only available in ST and GT trims for the 1994 model year, but the addition of the optional "Sports Package" to the GT Liftback produced GT-S-like handling. All models came with standard dual SRS Airbags. The ST had a new 1.8-liter 7A-FE engine which could also be found in the Corolla, while the GT was powered by the carried-over 2.2-liter 5S-FE engine which could also be found in the Camry. The turbocharged All-Trac was no longer offered in the U.S.  The 7A-FE is rated at . In Canada, the Celica GT Liftback with "Sports Package" is badged GT-S.
Initially the Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) models were SS-I and SS-II. The ST205 GT-Four was launched in February 1994, and the Convertible in the Autumn of the same year. The width of this generation was no longer in compliance with Japanese Government regulations concerning exterior dimensions, which added an additional tax liability on Japanese buyers. This generation also saw a badge engineered version without the headlight treatment, called the Toyota Curren, and was sold only in Japan at Toyota Vista Store locations, allowing the Celica to be sold at different retail sales channels. The Celica was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store locations.
Production of the GT-Four (or previously known as All-Trac in the US), continued for the Japanese, Australian, European, and British markets. This ST205 version was to be the most powerful Celica produced to date, producing  In some respects this car is a true sports car; in order to qualify for rallying it has a lot of special features and a unique strut arrangement.
In Australia, the Celica ST204 (2.2-liter) was offered in SX and ZR trim levels. The ZR has standard SRS Airbag, fog lights, alloys, and other features. The limited edition SX-R was offered in 1998–1999. Based on the SX, this model came with black/red interior, white-faced speedometer and tachometer, fog lights, and alloy wheels.
The ST205 Celica GT-Four was available in Australia only in 1994. There was a limited delivery of only 77 units ST205 with each vehicle came with an individual numbered plaque in the cabin and Group A Rallye badges on the hatch. All Australian models were taken from the 2500 homologation run and had black leather interior and a full size spare wheel. The only option being a moonroof (17 of the 77 were available with this).
The fourth generation convertible was introduced in 1994. Built off of the GT coupe, the conversion took place in the ASC facility in Rancho Dominguez, California. The vehicle arrived in the US as a partially assembled vehicle. At ASC, the roof was removed and a three-layer insulated and power-operated top was installed, producing a vehicle that was virtually water and windproof.
Like its Coupe and Liftback siblings, the American GT Convertible is ST204 with 5S-FE engine, while the Japanese Convertible, and European GT Cabriolet are the 3S-GE powered ST202. The JDM soft top Celica was offered as the base model Convertible Type X with either manual or automatic transmission, and the fully equipped automatic only Convertible.
In August 1995, minor changes were given to all JDM model Celicas, and the SS-III was added into the line up. All models received new rear combination lamps, and if fitted, the new style rear spoiler. The front drive models received new a front bumper design. The SS-III came with standard Super Strut Suspension and side aerodynamic rocker panels.
The GT-Four also got side rocker panels, restyled rear spoiler, and new alloys.
The 1996 Celica for export market received the same front restyling as the Japanese models, although the tail lights were untouched. The new front bumper has two smaller sections on each side of a smaller air dam as opposed to a single large air dam in previous models. Also new were optional side skirts to improve its aerodynamic efficiency, as well as a redesigned rear spoiler. The North American GT and Australian ZR models came with standard fog lights, and the ST and SX models without the optional fog lights had black grills fill in their place.
To celebrate 25 years of Celica, the SS-I and SS-III Special Edition were released in Japan, and the 25th Anniversary ST Limited and GT Convertible marked this occasion in the US. These Special Edition Celicas have special emblems on the front fenders, and the inside on the rear view mirror hanger, and the name Celica was printed on the front seats as well.
For 1997, the only change in the North American Celica was the discontinuation of the GT coupe. Another minor change was given to JDM Celicas in December 1997. Projector headlights were optional for all models. The 3S-GE engine on the SS-II and SS-III received VVT-i, the SS-III was given a BEAMS tuned 3S-GE engine. WRC style high rear spoiler returned on the GT-Four and also standard on the SS-III.
In 1998, the underpowered ST model was discontinued in the USA, leaving only GT models. In addition, the GT notchback coupe returned after a year's absence. The Celica line up was simplified even further in 1999 by eliminating all coupes, leaving only the GT Liftback and GT Convertible. In the UK, Toyota released the SR based on the 1.8 ST. The SR has full body kit, mesh grille, 16 inch alloys, and upgraded sound system. The GT-Four was still offered in Japan. Also in early 1999, Toyota released pictures of their XYR concept car, which would soon become the next Celica.

Seventh generation / T230 series (1999–2006)

In late 1999, Toyota began production and sales of the seventh generation Celica. It closely resembled the XYR concept with the exception of the front bumper and rear spoiler, while omitting the previously available coupe bodystyle.  The 2000 model year Celica was an element of Toyota Project Genesis, an effort to bring younger buyers to the marque in the United States. Toyota took time to lighten the car and lower cost wherever possible. Power window and door lock controls were placed in the center console so only 1 set was necessary for both doors. Initial sunroofs were made of polymer plastic instead of the traditional glass. This generation was assembled by Kanto Auto Works at its Higashi-Fuji plant in Susono, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.
The Celica came in two different models. The ZZT230 was powered by a relatively economical 1.8 L 4-cylinder 
Exporting of the Celica ceased in July 2005. However until mid-May, customers could still order one, although it was advised they took action before that time ended.
The last Celica was rolled off production line on April 21, 2006. In its last year, the Celica was only officially sold in Japan.

North America

In the US and Canada, two models were offered; the base model GT and the sportier GT-S.  All models are in liftback only body shape.    All models featured dual front airbags, daytime running lights (DRL) with auto-on parking and headlights, and 4 cup holders; two in the front and two in the rear.  Power door lock and power window switches were mounted on the center console to reduce costs. Rear seats were contoured for only 2 passengers and can split down 50/50 to increase cargo capacity.  Two-speed front wipers had variable intermittent adjustment.  The rear wiper had a single speed and fixed intermittent speed.  Windshield and rear window washers were also standard.  In the interest of light weight, optional sunroof was made of polymer plastics instead of glass.  In later models, the sunroof was made of glass, probably for cost reasons. Other options include ABS, rear spoiler, fog lights, HID low beam headlights, upgraded JBL stereo system, 6-disc CD changer, leather seat surfaces, side-impact airbags, floor mats, vehicle intrusion protection (VIP) alarms with door lock/unlock feature, cargo net, cold area package (heavy-duty battery and starter motor) and hatchback cargo cover. 
The GT was powered by the 1ZZ-FE rated at  of torque at 4200 rpm.  It uses Toyota's VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing with intelligence) system which modulated the intake cam phase angle to increase torque and horsepower throughout the rev range.  This is a similar engine used on the Matrix, Corolla, and MR2 Spyder.  Buyers had the option of between a 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmissions.  The vehicles were shod with 195/60/15 tires with front disc brakes and rear drum brakes.
The GT-S was powered by the 2ZZ-GE engine rated at  so most GT-S models had the optional wheels and tires.  All GT-S models had 4-wheel disc brakes and metal pedals.  Manual transmission shifters and all steering wheels were upgraded to leather.  Hatchback cargo covers were standard along with fog lights for models without the "Action Package."
TRD USA offered performance upgrades such as lowering springs, dampers, anti-sway bars, brake disc pads, air filters, exhaust, short-shift kits (manual transmissions), and body kits.  The exhaust offered an increase of , albeit mostly at higher rpm's.  A supercharger was also offered for the 1ZZ-FE engine however Toyota never marketed it directly for the Celica GT due to being too large to fit under the hood, The supercharger was available as an option for 2003–2004 Corolla and Matrix models.  The most popular among buyers were the "Action Package" which offered a more pronounced front spoiler, rocker panels, a rear wing, and lower rear fascia extension.  The revised front faring interfered with the mounting location for the standard factory fog lights, requiring them to be adjusted or removed when this option was added.
On the 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2004 GT-S models, the rev limiter is set to around 8200–8300 rpm (seems to differ vehicle-to-vehicle) while the 2002 and 2005 have it set to 7800 (left-hand drive markets only). This lower limiter on the 2002 and 2005 models reduces the available performance as the 2ZZ is primarily a high-revving engine, and it is more difficult for the driver to land in the 'lift' (aggressive cam) rev range on an upshift. This only affects the 6-speed manual transmission as the gearing is spaced to where shifting up at approximately 8,250 rpms in any gear other than first gear will result in about 6,200 rpm after the shift, which is where "lift", or the aggressive cam, engages. This allows models without the limited rpm range to remain within the car's power band throughout the gears. First gear is excluded because the gearing ratio is much lower than 2nd gear. For 2003, minor updates were made to the car.  The interior was mildly restyled, power antenna replaced the fixed one, the front and rear fascias were redone.  In 2004, all models were fitted with a cabin air filter.
In July 2004, Toyota announced the Celica (as well as the MR2) would be discontinued in the United States at the end of the 2005 model year due to lack of sales.toyota.html?id=20040716 Celica sales hit 52,406 units in 2000, but dropped sharply to 14,856 in 2003. Just 8,710 Celicas were sold in 2004, and only 3,113 were sold in 2005. The sports coupe market, in general, was rapidly shrinking, due in part to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the effects of the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, also known in Japan as the "bubble economy".  The Subaru XT6, Nissan 240SX, Honda Prelude and Mazda RX-7 were already gone and the Acura RSX was soon to follow. In 2005, the Scion project released a spiritual successor for the North American market – the Scion tC.

Japan

The Japanese models continued to carry SS-I and SS-II trim levels. The SS-I is powered by 1ZZ-FE engine, SS-II is motored by 2ZZ-GE engine. The SS-II also can be ordered with Super Strut Package with super strut suspension, rear strut bar, 16-inch alloys, metal pedals, and colored rocker panels. The SS-II has climate control AC with digital display. Options included the choice of the Elegant Sports Version with front lip spoiler and headlight covers, or the Mechanical Sports Version with full body kits.
The JDM Celica was updated with minor changes in August 2002.
Toyota also released a limited-production version of the 7th generation called the TRD Sports M based on the SS-II. This version was rated at  and featured a reinforced unibody and available TRD engine and suspension components. The Sports M was only sold in Japan.

Europe

All the European models have the 6-speed manual transmission, and was just marketed as 1.8 VVT-i and 1.8 VVTL-i 190 or T-Sport, which are the GT and GT-S, respectively.
In 2005, Toyota GB released the Celica GT. This is not the same as the GT in North America. The British GT is actually the T-Sport with a different bodykit, different alloy wheels, 30 mm lowered suspension and part leather part alcantara interior.

Asia Pacific

In Australia and New Zealand, the Celica was only offered with 2ZZ-GE engine (with 4-wheel disc brakes) in two trim levels, SX and ZR. The SX was fitted with 15-inch alloy wheels, CD player, electric windows and mirrors. The ZR has standard ABS, moonroof, SRS side and front airbags, fog lights, 16-inch alloy wheels, 6 stack in dash CD player (with tape deck) and aluminum pedals. Optional extras was the 4-speed tiptronic (Automatic), air conditioning and metallic paint. Satellite Navigation became available mid-2002 as an option. Sportivo body kits (which is the same as Mechanical Sports Version in Japan, or Action Package in the US) are available.
Although not officially imported by Toyota, there are many JDM models sold in Singapore and Indonesia. In Thailand and Hong Kong, the Celica was offered in one trim level similar to the Australian ZR with the 2ZZ-GE engine.

Safety

In Australia, 1981–1999 Toyota Celicas were all assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings 2006 as providing "average" protection for their occupants in the event of a crash.
A driver's side SRS airbag is standard in all US models from 1990. Dual SRS Airbags are standard from 1994. Seat-mounted side airbags are optional from 2000. The NHTSA NCAP rating for the 2005 model year is 4 stars for the Driver Front, 4 stars for the Passenger Front, and 3 stars for the Front side.


Motorsports

In motorsports, the Celica is known for its rallying prowess. The first World Rally Championship (WRC) event for the Celica was 1972 RAC Rally when Ove Andersson drove the 1600 GTV (TA22) into the ninth place. The first victory came in 1982 Rally of New Zealand with 2000GT (RA63). From 1983 to 1986, the Group B Celica Twincam Turbo (TA64) won all six WRC events in Africa they entered.
Celica GT-Four competed in Group A Rally racing from the 1988 to 1997. Celica GT-Four have won two manufacturer's titles, and four driver's titles. Carlos Sainz was the most successful driver, winning WRC titles with the ST165 in 1990 and the ST185 in 1992. The ST185 also won 1993 and 1994 titles with Juha Kankkunen and Didier Auriol respectively. The ST185's fourth consecutive Safari Rally victory came in 1995, which was also Toyota's 8th victory in this event. Soon after introducing the ST205 in 1995, a controversy was triggered when Toyota Team Europe was banned for 12 months from the WRC because of cheating (using an illegal turbo air restrictor). Some time after the ban expired TTE switched to the shorter Toyota Corolla WRC based on the AE111 3-door hatchback.
Special editions of the GT-Four models were produced for the public in extremely limited numbers, 5000 units, for WRC homologation requirements. They are considered a collector's item by some enthusiasts. The ST185's homogolation version is called the GT-Four RC in Japan, Group A Rallye in Australia, or Carlos Sainz Limited Edition (CS, after the driver) in Europe, and general markets.
In circuit racing, The Celica was raced by Dan Gurney's All American Racers team with factory backing in the IMSA GTU and GTO classes from 1983 to 1988.  The team captured many class wins and the GTO Championship in 1987. Slightly modified versions of stock Celicas were also used as the spec car in the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race, always held during the weekend of the Long Beach Grand Prix or (from 1976–1983) the United States Grand Prix West until 2005. In 2006 the Scion tC replaced the Celica as the spec car for this race.
Team Racing Project Bandoh created a special rear wheel drive variant of the seventh generation Celica using a 3S-GTE engine.urbanracer.asp?tid=21  It was entered into GT300 class of the Japanese Grand Touring Championship(and later Super GT) until 2008, which they switched their car to Lexus IS350 in race 3 that season.
The 1st generation liftback (known as Celica LB Turbo) was used to compete in the DRM between 1977 and 1978, the car was capable of producing 
Seventh generation Celicas were also successfully campaigned in the NHRA Sport Compact Drag Racing series during the early 2000s.  Toyotas run in the NHRA Funny Car class also used Celica bodies, although besides the body, these cars do not share any resemblance to their street counterparts.
The Celica (usually the first through third generation rear-wheel drive models powered by R series engines) was sometimes raced privately in stock car racing, usually in four-cylinder classes at the grassroots level.  A less stock version of the Celica with factory backing and development was campaigned successfully by several drivers in the Goody's Dash Series.  These Celicas started racing in 2000 and had 6th or 7th generation bodies but a steel tube-frame race chassis and a production based V6 engine that was not available in the street Celica.  Robert Huffman won the 2003 Dash Series Championship driving one of these Celicas.
Osborne Motorsport won their class in the 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour race.
