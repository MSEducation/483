[[Birrwil]]

Birrwil is a municipality in the district of Kulm in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

History

Isolated finds of artifacts indicate settlement during the Neolithic, Roman and Alamanni eras.  The beginnings of the modern town go back to an Alamanni named Bero (meaning Bear), who founded the village Beriwilare (meaning Bero's village) in the area.
The village was part of the dominion of Lenzburg, Kyburg and the finally the Habsburgs.  Between 1185-1331 there was a noble local family, though they and their castle have disappeared.  The power of Zwing und Bann (Manor rights as well as low justice) over the village, was held by the Lords of Hohenklingen, then from 1326-1798 by the citizens of Liebegg.   The Counts of Hallwyl owned a small piece of the shore (Dingstätte), starting in 1419.  For over three centuries (1415-1798) Birrwil was under the control of Bern.  Since the 1803 Act of Mediation created the Canton of Aargau, the village has been part of the new Canton.  The former manor houses were only fully incorporated in the 19th and 20th century into Birrwil (Schwaderhof 1822, Wilhof 1905).
The village church was first mentioned in 1275.  In 1528, during the Protestant Reformation, the church converted to the new religion.  In 1689 the old church was replaced by a new building.
Economically, both in the 18th and 19th century the cotton industry was a major source of income.  In 1857 the tobacco industry also entered the village.  Both of these formerly major industries have vanished from the municipality.  As of 1990, 17% of the population was employed in the primary economic sector, 31% in the secondary sector and 52% in the tertiary sector.  72% of the economically active population of Birrwil work outside the community.
