[[Equivalence class]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical relations

In mathematics, when a set has an equivalence relation defined on its elements, there is a natural grouping of elements that are related to one another, forming what are called equivalence classes. Notationally, given a set . 
When  has some structure, and the equivalence relation is defined with some connection to this structure, the quotient set often inherits some related structure. Examples include quotient spaces in linear algebra, quotient spaces in topology, quotient groups, homogeneous spaces, quotient rings, quotient monoids, and the quotient category.

Notation and formal definition

An equivalence relation is a binary relation 
The equivalence class of an element  and is defined as the set
of elements that are related to . 
When an element is chosen (often implicitly) in each equivalence class, this defines an injective map called a section. If this section is denoted by . Any element of a class may be chosen as a representative of the class, by choosing the section appropriately.
Sometimes, there is a section that is more "natural" than the other ones. In this case, the representatives are called canonical representatives. For example, in modular arithmetic, consider the equivalence relation on the integers defined by ).

Examples

Properties

Every element 
It follows from the properties of an equivalence relation that
In other words, if , then these statements are equivalent:

Graphical representation

Any binary relation can be represented by a directed graph and symmetric ones, such as equivalence relations, by undirected graphs. If 

Invariants

If .
A frequent particular case occurs when ".
Any function .
More generally, a function may map equivalent arguments (under an equivalence relation .
