Playing career

Minor hockey

MacArthur played minor hockey in his hometown of Lloydminster, Alberta.  He went unselected in the Western Hockey League (WHL) Bantam Draft when he was eligible, due in part to his short stature.  After the season, he was named his club's most valuable player.

Junior hockey

With the numbers MacArthur put up in bantam hockey, he was able to secure a tryout with the Medicine Hat Tigers, but was the club's final cut heading into the 2001–02 season.  As a result, MacArthur played in the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) for the Drayton Valley Thunder.  In his only season in the AJHL, MacArthur recorded 62 points in 62 games, and helped the Thunder capture a league championship. During the season he grew seven inches and the Medicine Hat Tigers were again interested in his services.  He joined the club for the 2002–03 season, putting up 75 points in 70 games as a WHL rookie.  During the summer, MacArthur was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in the third round (75th overall) of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft.
During his sophomore season in the WHL, MacArthur helped lead the Tigers to the 2004 WHL Championship and a berth in the 2004 Memorial Cup.  The Tigers lost in the semi-final of the tournament.  MacArthur played in 58 games during the 2004-05 season with the Tigers and recorded 74 points, while serving as one of the club's alternate captains.  After the season, he was named to the WHL's Eastern Conference First All-Star Team. MacArthur was remarkably consistent during his WHL career, scoring 75, 75 and 74 points in his three WHL seasons.

Professional hockey

MacArthur began his professional career with the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League (AHL) for the 2005 playoffs, appearing in three games and recording an assist for his first professional point.  He remained with Rochester in 2005–06, recording 53 points over 69 games in his first full professional season. After starting the 2006–07 season in Rochester for a second year, MacArthur made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut for the Buffalo Sabres on December 19, 2006 against the Montreal Canadiens.
MacArthur spent his first full season at the NHL level in 2008–09, playing in 71 games with the Sabres and recording 31 points.  After the season, the Sabres tendered MacArthur a qualifying offer to retain his rights; he subsequently signed a two-year deal with the club in July 2009.  MacArthur played in 60 games for the Sabres, scoring 13 goals and adding 13 assists, before being traded to the Atlanta Thrashers for two draft picks at the trade deadline. He finished the season with the Thrashers recording nine points in 21 games.

After the 2009–10 season, MacArthur filed for arbitration.  After the hearing, MacArthur was awarded a one-year contract worth $2.4 million, a significant raise over his previous salary of $1.4 million.  The Thrashers chose not to accept the arbitration award, and MacArthur became an unrestricted free agent.
MacArthur scored goals in each of his first four games with the club, becoming the first player in team history to do so.  On November 16, MacArthur tied a club record by recording three assists in a period against the Nashville Predators.  The following month, he tied his personal career best when he scored two goals against the Pittsburgh Penguins on October 13. He re-signed for two years, at $3.25 million per annum, with Toronto on July 5, 2011 avoiding arbitration with the club.
