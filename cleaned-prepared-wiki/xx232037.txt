History

The airfield opened in 1928 on  of farmland purchased by the Kreider-Reisner Aircraft Company. It was purchased by the City of Hagerstown in 1933.
The facility was named Washington County Regional Airport in 1981, when ownership was transferred from the City of Hagerstown to Washington County. In 1998, the county renamed it Hagerstown Regional Airport - Richard A. Henson Field.
US Airways Express served Hagerstown Regional for quite some time. The last discontinued destination from HGR was Pittsburgh International Airport. Due to low ridership and an expired federal subsidy, the airline cancelled service in September 2007. The airport was without an airline for just over a year until the advent of Allegiant Air which ended its service in July 2010.
Allegiant Air flew from HGR to Orlando Sanford International Airport with two departures on Friday and two arrivals on Monday.  The airline started commercial service on 14 November 2008. The airline used the McDonnell Douglas MD-82/MD-83 aircraft on this route. Scheduled service ended on July 19, 2010, but has since resumed. On August 13, 2013, Allegiant began a three–month hiatus from operations at Hagerstown Regional Airport. They will resume service on November 15, 2013 with afternoon flights.
In July and August 2011 the airport had service from Direct Air operated by Dynamic Airways to Lakeland, Florida and Myrtle Beach.  Direct Air then identified Hagerstown as a seasonal market.  Direct Air's decision was based on several contributing factors, these include, fuel costs; the number of advance ticket sales approaching the fall and winter months; the summer vacation season nearing an end, aircraft availability and the underlying tone of the economy which is indicating a slowing of leisure travel spending nationwide.  Direct Air stated they planned on returning to the Hagerstown market in the spring of 2012.  The charter carrier was subject to Chapter 7 liquidation on April 12, 2012.
On November 5, 2012, Sun Air International began offering daily flights to Washington-Dulles International Airport.
