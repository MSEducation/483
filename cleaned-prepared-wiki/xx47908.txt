Virgin TrainsCompanies House extract company no 3007940 West Coast Trains Limited is a train operating company in the United Kingdom owned by Virgin Group (51%) and Stagecoach (49%) that has operated the InterCity West Coast franchise since 9 March 1997. Virgin Trains operate long-distance passenger services on the West Coast Main Line between Greater London, the West Midlands, North West England, North Wales and Scotland. The service connects five of the UK's largest cities; London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow as well as Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, which have a combined metropolitan population of over 18 million people.

History

Virgin Rail Group was awarded the InterCity West Coast franchise in January 1997 after beating Sea Containers and Stagecoach with operations commencing on 9 March 1997.Virgin passengers get 'better deal' BBC News 7 October 1998
When Virgin won the franchise, Railtrack was to upgrade the West Coast Main Line to allow tilting trains to operate at 140 mph by 2005. In the wake of the collapse of Railtrack and the inability of Network Rail to deliver on the 140 mph West Coast Main Line upgrade, both the Virgin CrossCountry and Virgin West Coast franchises were suspended in favour of management contracts in July 2002.5 billion to £10 billion there were cutbacks to the upgrade and the top speed reduced to 125 mph.West Coast railway upgrade under threat The Telegraph 24 July 2003

Services

In May 1998 Virgin introduced new services from London Euston to Shrewsbury and Blackpool North. The former ceased in 1999, the latter in May 2003.Pride of Shrewsbury The Encyclopedia of Modern Traction NamesRail Magazine Issue 462 28 May 2003 Page 14
In September 2004 a London Euston to Llandudno service was introduced ceasing in December 2008.org.uk
In September 2005 Virgin introduced its first 125 mph timetable following the completion of Stage 1 of the upgrade.
In December 2007 as part of a reshuffle of rail franchises by the Department for Transport, services from Birmingham New Street to Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central via Crewe were transferred from the CrossCountry franchise to the InterCity West Coast franchise.New Cross Country Franchise Consultation Document Department for Transport June 2006
In December 2008 a Wrexham to London Euston service was introduced operating south in the morning with an evening return.Wrexham joins the Virgin network Virgin Trains Press Release 15 December 2008Rail Magazine Issue 586 27 February 2008 Page 11
In February 2009 an hourly London Euston to Chester service was introduced.Roman legionnaires swap chariots for trains Virgin Trains Press Release 16 February 2009
From January 2009 Virgin Trains gradually rolled out a new Very High Frequency timetable to take advantage of the completed West Coast Main Line upgrade. 
There were many timetable changes from 8 December 2013. These resulted in new timetables. Most Edinburgh/Glasgow to Birmingham services were extended to/from London replacing the hourly Wolverhampton to Euston service. This has resulted in the latter being serviced by four Virgin trains in each direction per hour in lieu of the previous two. 
London - Scotland via the West Midlands and the North WestVirgin Trains Timetable A 1 train per hour to Glasgow Central or Edinburgh Waverley (alternating each hour) via Birmingham. A more direct service to Glasgow is provided by the F service. A faster and more frequent service to Edinburgh operates from London King's Cross with East Coast via the East Coast Main Line.

London - GlasgowVirgin Trains Timetable A & F 1 train per hour between London and Glasgow. This service is also supplemented by the London - Scotland A service. In addition, six services per day (in the morning and evening peaks) call at Motherwell.

Moderation of competition

As a way of protecting the revenues of Virgin Trains to enable it to pay franchise premiums to the government to partly recoup the cost of the West Coast Main Line upgrade, the Office of Rail Regulation inserted a Moderation of Competition in Virgin's Track Access Agreement. Until its expiry in March 2012, this prevented any other train operating or open access companies operating services in competition that would abstract revenue.Model Clauses for Track Access Agreements: Access Rights and Moderation of Competition Office of the Rail Regulator June 2001

Performance

Virgin Trains suffered poor punctuality compared with some other transport operators between 2001 and 2006, according to Office of Rail Regulation statistics. Punctuality did gradually improve until the introduction of a new timetable (in December 2008), following the upgrade of the West Coast Main Line, which resulted in a dip in performance.
The PPM MAA (Public Performance Measure Moving Annual Average - % of trains arriving within 10 minutes of the scheduled times) figures for Virgin Trains are as follows:
Latest figures published by Network Rail for the seventh period of 2013-2014 recorded PPM of 92.2% for the period and a MAA of 83.5% for the 12 months up to 12 October 2013. The PPM performance for the period is down 2.7 percentage points on the corresponding figure from the same period last year. Network Rail noted that Virgin Trains were only responsible for 16% of delays in period 5. Network Rail was itself directly responsible for 50% of Virgin Trains' delays, 20% were a result of external factors (e.g. fatalities) and the final 14% were due to other operators.

Grayrigg derailment

On 23 February 2007 a Class 390 Pendolino forming the 17:15 London Euston to Glasgow Central service derailed in the village of Grayrigg in Cumbria. The train itself however was widely praised for the way it retained its structural integrity. Richard Branson also praised the train driver because he attempted to stop the train and did not get out of the cab before it derailed.

Rolling stock

Virgin inherited a fleet of Class 86, Class 87 and Class 90s hauling Mark 2 and Mark 3 carriages with Driving Van Trailers on its electrified services and High Speed Trains for London Euston to Holyhead services.
A franchise commitment was the replacement of these trains with new tilting stock. In 1999 Virgin signed a deal to lease forty-four eight-carriage and nine nine-carriage Class 390 Pendolinos built by Alstom. The first entered service in January 2003. With the exception of services to Holyhead, the final locomotive hauled trains were withdrawn in June 2005.Rail Magazine Issue 516 22 June 2005 Page 6
To operate the Holyhead services four four-carriage Class 221 Super Voyagers were included in the order placed by Virgin CrossCountry. By the time they were delivered it was decided these would be too short so they entered service with Virgin CrossCountry. In September 2004 the High Speed Trains were withdrawn with services being operated by a combination of five-carriage Class 221 Super Voyagers hired from Virgin CrossCountry and Class 47 and Class 90 hauled Mark 3 sets. From September 2005 Class 57/3s hauling Class 390 Pendolinos took over the locomotive hauled diagrams. This continued until December 2008 when five-carriage Class 221 Super Voyagers took over all services.
With the Class 390 Pendolinos needing modification in 2006, a First GBRf Class 87 was hired to haul a Mark 3 set on Birmingham New Street services.Class 87 - History The AC Locomotive Group
To operate the Birmingham to Edinburgh and Glasgow services transferred from CrossCountry in December 2007, three four-carriage and thirteen five-carriage Class 221 Super Voyagers were transferred. A further five five-carriage Class 221 Super Voyagers followed in December 2008.Rail Magazine Issue 575 26 September 2007 Page 16
In August 2008 Bombardier started a programme to rearrange the Class 221 Super Voyagers with the carriage containing the shop moved to adjoin the first class carriage and refurbished with 2+2 seats arranged more spaciously around tables. This allowed it to be used as a first class carriage on Holyhead services and as a standard class carriage at other times.Rail Magazine Issue 600 10 September 2008 Page 70
In December 2010 one four-carriage Class 221 Super Voyager was disbanded with the two centre carriages being inserted into the other four-carriage sets to give Virgin a fleet of twenty five-carriage Class 221 Super Voyagers.
To provide it with a fleet of locomotives for use on diversionary services during the West Coast Mainline upgrade and rescue duties, Virgin signed a deal with Porterbrook in March 2002 to rebuild twelve Class 47s as Class 57/3s with the first delivered in June 2002.Rail Magazine Issue 468 20 August 2003 Page 62 Following the completion of the West Coast Main Line upgrade in 2008 their use fell and after being sublet to Arriva Trains Wales, Colas Rail and First GBRf, six were returned to Porterbrook in August 2011,57 Locomotive leased to Network Rail Porterbrook Leasing News 10 October 2011 three in April 2012Porterbrook has reached an agreement with Direct Rail Services for the lease of three Class 57 locomotives Porterbrook Leasing News 4 April 2012 and the remaining seven in December 2012.
Virgin had long been angling for a franchise extension in return for ordering extra carriages for the Class 390 Pendolinos. The Department for Transport rejected this and instead placed an order itself with Alstom for 106 carriages allowing for four complete eleven-carriage sets and 31 sets to be extended by two carriages. The four new sets were delivered in 2011/12 while 31 sets are currently receiving extra carriages with all to be complete by December 2012. This has required a number of stations to have platforms lengthened.
Following the loss of a Class 390 Pendolino in the Grayrigg derailment, a Mark 3 set with a Class 82 Driving Van Trailer was leased with a Class 90 hired from EWS as required. In 2008 Virgin looked at leasing two Class 180Rail Magazine Issue 591 7 May 2008 Page 64 but decided to retain the Mark 3 set. Nicknamed the Pretendolino, this received re-upholstered seating, power points, wi-fi and a full external re-paint at Wabtec, Doncaster in 2009. It sometimes is used on London - Birmingham services in the event of a Pendolino shortage. It was used in the filming of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' and can be seen at King's Cross station at the end of the film.
All seats on Class 221 Super Voyagers and Class 390 Pendolinos originally had an on-board audio entertainment system featuring a number of radio or pre-recorded music channels. This was disabled in March 2010"Please note: Virgin Trains onboard entertainment system no longer functions."

Past fleet

Depots

The Class 390 fleet is allocated to the Alstom Traincare Centre at Longsight with lighter maintenance and overnight servicing carried out at Wembley, Oxley, Edge Hill and Polmadie depots. The Class 221 fleet is allocated to Bombardier's Central Rivers depot with lighter maintenance and overnight servicing carried out at LNWR, Crewe and Holyhead.

Future franchising arrangements

Virgin Trains's franchise was due to expire in March 2012. In 2009 Richard Branson launched a campaign to have the next franchise period extended for 20 to 30 years, so that Virgin would be able to spend more on infrastructure and be able to see a return on investment.
In January 2011 the Department for Transport called for expressions of interest in bidding for the next InterCity West Coast franchise.
The Invitation to Tender was issued to the shortlisted bidders in January 2012
In October 2012 the Secretary of State for Transport announced the government was cancelling the franchise competition for the InterCity West Coast franchise after discovering significant technical flaws in the way the franchise process was conducted, reversing the decision to award it to FirstGroup. Following an independent review of the franchising process, a fresh competition will be held.html "Two-year extension for Virgin Rail after West Coast chaos". The Daily Telegraph (London). 6 December 2012.
In March 2013 the Secretary of State for Transport announced the franchise would again be extended until 29 April 2017."Railway plan puts new focus on passengers". Secretary of State for Transport. 26 March 2013.
In July 2013 the Office of Rail Regulation rejected an application by Virgin Trains to operate new services to Shrewsbury and Blackpool North, citing capacity constraints on the West Coast Main Line.

Sponsorship

Virgin Trains sponsors Carlisle United F.C. as their travel sponsor for the 2013–14 season, and for the 2014–15 season they are to be the club's main shirt sponsor in a further two year deal.
