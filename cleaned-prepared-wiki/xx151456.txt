Game notes

Oregon 48, Stanford 10

In their first game of the year, the Ducks routed Stanford 48–10. Jonathan Stewart had two touchdowns and 168 yards rushing in the game, although he was forced out due to an ankle sprain. Oregon and Stanford exchanged field goals in the first quarter, before Stewart's first touchdown run gave the Ducks a 10–3 lead with 13:36 left in the second. A 15-yard touchdown pass from Dennis Dixon to Jaison Williams extended Oregon's lead to 17–3. The Cardinal responded with a 26-yard touchdown pass by Trent Edwards, but the Ducks scored 10 points in the half's final 3:19, including Stewart's second touchdown run of the game. At halftime, Oregon held a 27–10 lead.
The only score of the third quarter was made by Dixon, who ran for two yards and a touchdown midway through the quarter to stretch the Oregon lead to 24 points. Following a missed field goal attempt by Stanford, Jeremiah Johnson had a three-yard touchdown run to give the Ducks a 41–10 lead in the fourth quarter. The scoring was concluded by Oregon's A. J. Tuitele, who picked up a blocked Stanford field goal attempt and ran for a 72-yard touchdown. A total of 58,450 people attended the game at Autzen Stadium; this was the fourth-most ever and the biggest crowd for a season-opening game.

Oregon 31, Fresno State 24

The No. 20-ranked Ducks won in a tight contest at Fresno State, 31–24. At halftime, Oregon held a 17–10 lead, but on its first possession of the second half Fresno State scored a game-tying touchdown. Later in the third quarter, Oregon drove down the field and attempted a 36-yard field goal. The kick was blocked by Fresno State's Bear Pascoe, but a Bulldog went to pick up the ball instead of leaving it, which would have resulted in a turnover. He was unable to field it, and the Ducks recovered at the Fresno State five-yard line. Oregon scored on the next play through a Jeremiah Johnson run; it was his second touchdown run of the game.
Fresno State responded in the fourth quarter with another game-tying drive, which featured a 40-yard Dwayne Wright rush. Tom Brandstater scored from one yard out to force a 24–24 tie. Oregon drove down the field, but was kept out of the end zone on a third-and-goal play, apparently forcing the Ducks to settle for a field goal. However, they ran a trick play; Brady Leaf, the holder on kicks, took off running and pitched the ball to kicker Paul Martinez, who ran four yards for what turned out to be the game-winning touchdown.

Oregon 34, Oklahoma 33

Oregon, after a 16-yard TD by Dennis Dixon, trailed the Sooners 33-27 with 1:12 left. Dixon had 341 passing yards and two touchdown passes, in addition to running for a touchdown.

The Ducks scored two touchdowns in the first quarter to take an early 14–0 lead. Following an Arizona State field goal midway through the second quarter, Oregon scored 10 points in the final 3:46 of the first half for a 24–3 halftime lead.

With 1:04 left in the first half, the Ducks scored their first touchdown of the game, having successfully faked a field goal attempt earlier in the drive. The Golden Bears scored the first 10 points of the third quarter, extending their lead to 28 points. Dixon threw two touchdown passes in the final 15:20 of the game, but the Golden Bears finished with a 45–24 win.
