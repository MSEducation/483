[[Green Corps]]

CATEGORIES: Environmental organizations based in the United States

Green Corps, the field school for environmental organizing, is a non-profit organization with the stated mission to "train organizers, provide field support for today's critical environmental campaigns, and graduate activists who possess the skills, temperament, and commitment to fight and win tomorrow's environmental battles."  Upon graduating from the program, the participant will have led three to five of these campaigns and will have the tools necessary to become important members of the movement.

History

Green Corps was founded in 1992 by Gina Cummings and Leslie Samuelrich to train young people to become environmental organizers.
Green Corps was founded in response to the momentum created by Earth Day in 1990.  Interest and desire to act burgeoned on university campuses around the country, producing graduates who were passionate and ready to contribute to the movement but who were faced with an obstacleâ€”how do you find a position with one of these activist groups with minimal experience?
During the Green Corps year, participants work with veterans in the field to make progress on important campaigns.  Through partnering with these other influential groups, the Green Corps member creates valuable ties and learns from those who have been on the front lines.  Upon graduating, Green Corps members pursue careers with these leading organizations.
