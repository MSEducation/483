Quiet Riot is an American heavy metal band, best known for their hit singles "Metal Health" and "Cum on Feel the Noize". The band was founded in 1973 by guitarist Randy Rhoads and bassist Kelly Garni under the original name Mach 1, before changing the name to Little Women and finally Quiet Riot in May 1975. The band's name was inspired by a conversation with Rick Parfitt of the British band Status Quo, in which Parfitt said he'd like to name a band "Quite Right", 
The original line-up featured Rhoads and Garni with lead vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth. Their most commercially successful lineup consisted of DuBrow alongside guitarist Carlos Cavazo, bassist Rudy Sarzo and drummer Frankie Banali, and in 1983 released their breakthrough album Metal Health, which is known for being the first heavy metal album to top the Billboard album chart. Despite several lineup changes and brief breakups, Quiet Riot continued to record and tour until DuBrow's death from an accidental cocaine overdose in 2007. Banali revived the band in 2010, and the current lineup consists of himself on drums, lead vocalist Jizzy Pearl, bassist Chuck Wright and guitarist Alex Grossi.

History

Early years with the original band (1973–1983)

Quiet Riot were one of the more successful hard rock acts in Los Angeles in the mid to late 1970s. They often opened for Van Halen in several L.A. clubs including the Starwood and KROQ's Cabaret nightclub, before either act had a record deal. Nonetheless, Quiet Riot was unable to procure a recording contract in the United States. By 1977 they were able to secure a deal with Sony, but their records would be released only in Japan. The original four members recorded their debut album Quiet Riot, or QR I, in 1977. Vocalist Kevin DuBrow and bassist Kelly Garni did not get along. According to Garni, "I was on a constant quest to get him out of the band and get a different singer. I hated him, he hated me and we could not find any way whatsoever to get along which caused a lot of tension in the band and it put a lot of stress on Randy to try to be neutral."
In 1979, Rhoads auditioned for Ozzy Osbourne's band upon the recommendation of future Slaughter bassist Dana Strum. Osbourne himself has stated that he hired Rhoads immediately. Shortly thereafter, Sarzo also left Quiet Riot for Osbourne's band. Since no one expected Quiet Riot to reform at this point, according to Sarzo "a lot of the Quiet Riot songs ended up on the Osbourne albums under different titles. Obviously Randy thought we'd never use those songs again so he'd give the riffs to Ozzy who'd come up with new words." Sarzo went on to say that the Osbourne song "Suicide Solution" originated as a Quiet Riot demo called "Force of Habit".
According to DuBrow, Rhoads' departure from Quiet Riot "didn't derail the band, it ended it." He and Forsyth continued on with the addition of guitarist Greg Leon During this period (1980–1982) the band changed its name to 'DuBrow' and also played shows with former Gamma drummer Skip Gillette. By 1982 guitarist Carlos Cavazo and drummer Frankie Banali had also been recruited by DuBrow.

A new lineup and success with Metal Health (1982–1984)

Randy Rhoads died in a plane crash while on tour with Ozzy Osbourne in March 1982, after which Rudy Sarzo quit Osbourne's band. DuBrow contacted Sarzo and asked him to play on a track called "Thunderbird", which was a tribute to Rhoads. The lineup of DuBrow, Sarzo, Cavazo, and Banali had so much fun recording the track that they wound up recording half of an album in the process. The previous bassist for the band DuBrow was sacked to make room for Sarzo in the new lineup. There was some uncertainty over whether this incarnation of the band should be named DuBrow or Quiet Riot; in the end they decided on Quiet Riot "because although Randy wouldn't be in it, the original spirit of the band was back," according to Sarzo.
In September 1982, with help from producer Spencer Proffer, they were signed to CBS Records in America and completed recording the album Metal Health, which was released on March 11, 1983. This was Quiet Riot's American debut, as their two previous albums, QR I and QR II, have still not been released in North America, despite the band's subsequent success.
On August 27, 1983, Quiet Riot's second single "Cum on Feel the Noize" was released. A cover of the 1973 hit by Slade, the single spent two weeks at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in November 1983 and was the first heavy metal song to make the top 5 on that chart. The success of the single helped carry the album Metal Health to the top of Billboard album chart, making it the first American heavy metal debut album to ever reach No. 1 in the United States. On November 26, 1983 Quiet Riot became the first heavy metal band to have a top 5 hit and No. 1 album in the same week. Metal Health displaced The Police's Synchronicity at No. 1 and stayed there for just a week until Lionel Richie's Can't Slow Down took over the No. 1 spot.
Metal Health's title track, which had been released as the album's first single on March 11, 1983, finally charted in early 1984 and peaked at No. 31. This could be attributed to the song's appearance in the 1984 movie Footloose, as well as another heavily rotated video on MTV.
In support of Metal Health, Quiet Riot toured North America as the opening act for Black Sabbath on their Born Again tour from October 1983 through March 1984.

Steady decline and DuBrow's firing (1984–1989)

The group's follow-up, Condition Critical, was released on July 7, 1984. Though successful, it was a relative critical and commercial disappointment, selling only 3 million units and reaching only No. 15 on the Billboard album chart. 
DuBrow's tirades led to fan backlash and clashes in the media with several other Los Angeles-based metal bands, which resulted in Rudy Sarzo quitting the group in January 1985.
Fed up with DuBrow's antics and pressure from the band's management and record label, the rest of Quiet Riot fired DuBrow from his own band in February 1987 and replaced him with former Rough Cutt vocalist Paul Shortino, leaving no original members in the band. Chuck Wright left the band shortly thereafter and Sarzo was invited to return. Sarzo agreed but was committed to Whitesnake at the time. The group then recruited Sean McNabb for the bassist slot. The revamped band released their second self-titled album, Quiet Riot (also known as QR IV), in October 1988. The album failed to return the band to its commercial glory. In April 1989 the band members went their separate ways. A show from their final tour was later released on a DVD titled '89 Live in Japan. Frankie Banali resurfaced on the W.A.S.P. album The Headless Children, and played some shows with Faster Pussycat. Sean McNabb joined House of Lords in 1991, where he ironically replaced Chuck Wright, the bass player whom he also replaced in Quiet Riot. Kevin DuBrow subsequently fought in court to keep control of the band's name.

Reformation and Metal Health lineup reunion (1990-2003)

Having won the rights to the band's name, DuBrow teamed up with 21 year-old English born blues guitarist Sean Manning, bassist Kenny Hillery, and drummer Pat Ashby to reform Quiet Riot. Initially using the moniker Little Women (a name Rhoads and DuBrow used in the 1970s before settling on Quiet Riot) on tour to avoid any adverse publicity, DuBrow and Manning compiled songs for a new album, which would eventually become the 1993 release Terrified. The band played venues throughout the United States until 1990 when Manning left to join the band Hurricane.
By the early 1990s tempers had cooled between former bandmates Carlos Cavazo and Kevin DuBrow, and they started to communicate again. They eventually formed the band Heat in 1990 with bassist Kenny Hillery and drummer Bobby Rondinelli. This foursome reverted to the name Quiet Riot the following year and released the aforementioned Terrified in 1993 with Banali rejoining on drums. Chuck Wright then rejoined on bass for a 1994 tour in support of Terrified.
That same year, DuBrow released The Randy Rhoads Years, a compilation featuring remixed tracks from Quiet Riot's two Japan-only releases along with previously unreleased material, many of which featured newly recorded vocals. Greatest Hits covered only material from the CBS years, including three tracks from the 1988 album with Shortino and two previously promo-only live tracks. Former bassist Kenny Hillery, who had left the group in 1994, committed suicide on June 5, 1996. 
Rudy Sarzo rejoined the band again in 1997, recreating the Metal Health lineup. During a tour that year, one angry fan sued DuBrow for injuries she claimed were sustained during a show.

Second reformation and death of DuBrow (2004-2007)

Kevin DuBrow released his first solo album, In for the Kill, in May 2004, which was followed by the announcement of a Quiet Riot reunion in October 2004.
Wright and Grossi left the band in early 2006. During this period Quiet Riot also included guitarists Billy Morris and Neil Citron, and bassists Sean McNabb and Wayne Carver. During 2006, Quiet Riot worked on a new studio album that was expected to be released in either 2006 or 2007. The band stated that they had set no timetable for the release of the album, that they were financing the project themselves, and that it would be released when they saw fit and on their terms.C. Banana at Metal Sludge on 8/7/06. Ex-The Firm and Blue Murder bassist Tony Franklin worked with the band in the studio. Quiet Riot finally released the album Rehab on October 3, 2006; featuring a lineup of DuBrow, Banali, Franklin, and Neil Citron. Former Deep Purple bassist and singer Glenn Hughes made a guest vocal appearance on the album. By the end of 2006, Wright and Grossi were back in the band and toured in support of the album. In 2007, Quiet Riot were featured in radio promos for ESPN Radio, parodying their status as outdated rock n' roll icons, with commentary from DuBrow and Banali.
On November 25, 2007, Kevin DuBrow was found dead in his Las Vegas apartment. Frankie Banali confirmed the death in an e-mail to Spain's The Metal Circus. Banali wrote:
 
 "Please respect my privacy as I mourn the passing and honor the memory of my dearest friend Kevin DuBrow."

On December 10, 2007, media reports confirmed that DuBrow was pronounced dead on November 25, 2007, and was later determined to have died of a cocaine overdose approximately six days earlier. On January 14, 2008, Banali issued the following statement via his website regarding the future of Quiet Riot:
 
 "I have been approached to see if I would be interested in contacting Rudy Sarzo and Carlos Cavazo and to audition singers for Quiet Riot. I have also been approached to see if I would be interested in contacting and reforming the version of Quiet Riot that included Paul Shortino, Carlos Cavazo and Sean McNabb. Let me make this very simple and perfectly clear. While I am still actively involved in the business interests of Quiet Riot and will continue in that capacity, I reject any and all suggestions to have Quiet Riot continue as a live performing entity. My friendship, love and respect for Kevin DuBrow as well as my personal love and affection for Kevin's mother and his family makes it inconceivable for me to ever entertain any ovation to reform or to continue Quiet Riot. Kevin was too important to go on without him. It would also be a disrespect to the fans who have supported Quiet Riot for nearly 25 years. I thank everyone for the wonderful and sometimes unpredictable adventure that I was able to share as a member of Quiet Riot. The only regret that I have is the loss of Kevin. May he rest in peace. I now begin life after Quiet Riot."

Revival with multiple vocalists (2010–present)

Despite his previous insistence that Quiet Riot could never return as a live performing entity, Banali announced a new version of Quiet Riot in September 2010 with himself on drums, Chuck Wright on bass, Alex Grossi on guitar, and newcomer Mark Huff (formerly of the Van Halen tribute band 5150) on vocals.
On January 12, 2012, whilst Huff was awaiting brain surgery,
Original bassist and founding member Kelly Garni released his long-awaited autobiography in October 2012. The book covers the beginnings and early years of Quiet Riot, as well as details of Garni's friendship with founder Randy Rhoads.
In November 2013, it was announced that Scott Vokoun had amicably parted ways with Quiet Riot, and that his replacement is Love/Hate vocalist Jizzy Pearl, who played his first show with the band on December 31 in Flagstaff, Arizona. The band are currently in the recording studio, working on a new studio album which is set for release in early 2014. 
In December 2013, Frankie Banali was interviewed by Loudwire, during which he discussed the future of Quiet Riot as well as their upcoming album. He revealed that the album will feature six new songs recorded in the studio, with former bassist Rudy Sarzo and Rehab session bassist Tony Franklin playing on two songs each, as well as four live songs taken from Kevin DuBrow's final professionally-recorded shows with the band in 2007. Banali said of the song choices: 
 
 "I made a conscious decision not to use the usual songs that people would expect. I picked tracks that were special and of the moment. Let's just say that there will be a familiar track, two unexpected choices and one that really shows the roots of Quiet Riot and how the band interacted in the live arena. I think that Quiet Riot fans will really appreciate my choices."
 
Banali has also worked on a Quiet Riot documentary, which is titled "Well Now You're Here, There's No Way Back" (named after a lyric in the band's hit song "Bang Your Head (Metal Health)") and was directed and produced by Banali's fiancee Regina Russell.

Legacy

Quiet Riot's song "Bang Your Head (Metal Health)" is used as the title theme to the video game Showdown: Legends of Wrestling.
