Mark Dantonio (born March 9, 1956) is an American football coach and former player. He is the current head football coach at Michigan State University, a position he has held since the 2007 season, presiding over one of the most successful eras in the Program's history. He has led the Michigan State Spartans to three seasons of 11 or more wins, two Big Ten Conference championships, and four straight victories over rival Michigan.  In 2013, he coached Michigan State to its first 13-win season and the program's fifth trip to the Rose Bowl, where they defeated Stanford.     This was only the second time a Big Ten team had reached the 13 win mark, with the other being Ohio State's National Championship season in 2002-03 where Dantonio was the Defensive Coordinator.  The 2013-14 season also marked the first time a Big Ten team won 9 conference games by double digits in each contest.  From 2004 to 2006 Dantonio was the head football coach at the University of Cincinnati.
In 2006, Dantonio was hired as the Spartans head coach, returning to the school where he had previously served six years as an assistant coach under Nick Saban and Bobby Williams.com Known as a defensive-minded coach, Dantonio has compiled a 63–29 record at Michigan State, giving him a .685 winning percentage, the highest of any Michigan State football coach since that of Clarence Munn, who coached the Spartans from 1947 to 1953. During his tenure the Spartans have won the school's first bowl game since 2001 in the 2012 Outback Bowl. On October 8, 2011, Dantonio signed a contract extension that made him a "Spartan for life."

Early coaching career

Dantonio began his coaching career at Ohio University, where he was a graduate assistant.  In 1981, he made his first stop in the Big Ten Conference when he moved on to Purdue University as a graduate assistant. He spent two years, in 1983 and 1984, as a graduate assistant at Ohio State University  under head coach Earle Bruce. In 1986, he began a five-year stint on Jim Tressel's staff at Youngstown State University as a defensive secondary coach.  In 1990, Dantonio led the Penguins' defense to an 11–0 record and a #2 ranking nationally.  Glen Mason hired Dantonio in 1991 to be the defensive secondary coach for the Kansas Jayhawks. When Nick Saban was hired at Michigan State in 1995, he hired Dantonio to join his staff in East Lansing where he remained even after Saban left for LSU.  After Bobby Williams was named head coach in 1999 following Saban's departure, Dantonio was promoted to associate head coach where he remained through the 2000 season.

Defensive coordinator at Ohio State

In 2001, Dantonio reunited with his former Youngstown State boss and good friend Jim Tressel when he opted out of East Lansing to serve as defensive coordinator at Ohio State University for three seasons.  His defense became known as one of the stingiest in the country. During the Buckeyes' 2002 National Championship season, Ohio State ranked second nationally in scoring defense and third in rushing defense.  In the 2003 season, his defense ranked number one in the country in rushing defense and ninth in total defense, which led the Buckeyes to an 11–2 record and #4 national ranking.  Six Buckeye defenders were named first team All-Big Ten during Dantonio's tenure. Thirteen were drafted into the NFL, including two first round picks in Chris Gamble and Will Smith.

Head coach at Cincinnati

Dantonio was named head coach at Cincinnati on December 23, 2003.  He became the first head coach in 23 years to lead the school to a winning season in his first season at UC. The Bearcats' 7–5 record included a 5–3 record in Conference USA, which was good enough for a second place finish. The Bearcats finished the season on a winning note with a 32–14 win over Marshall in the PlainsCapital Fort Worth Bowl.  During Dantonio's time at UC, he led the Bearcats to a bowl game victory and directed the team's transition into the Big East Conference.  As head coach, Dantonio had fifteen players earn all-conference honors and twenty-five received conference academic recognition.

Head coach at Michigan State

Mark Dantonio became the 24th head coach at Michigan State on November 27, 2006. Upon his arrival, Dantonio planned to return MSU to a more traditional philosophy on offense and defense, eliminating the spread offense and the "bandit" linebacker/safety position used under previous head coach John L. Smith. "Inside the Deal". Lansing State Journal. November 28, 2006.  Accessed March 13, 2007
Dantonio began his MSU career well at Spartan Stadium when on April 21, 2007 Michigan State drew over 25,000 fans to watch the team's spring scrimmage game. The white team, led by sophomore quarterback Connor Dixon, defeated junior quarterback Brian Hoyer and the green team by a score of 21–8. During the game, Dantonio was seen behind the line of scrimmage watching and coaching the action. "Dantonio presides over first spring game as Michigan State coach". Sporting News. April 21, 2007.
