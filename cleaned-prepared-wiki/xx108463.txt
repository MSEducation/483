The Australian University Games (AUGa) is a multi-sport competition held annually in September / October between teams fielded from a large number of Australian universities and tertiary institutions. The Games were first held in 1993 in Brisbane, Queensland. Owned by Australian University Sport (AUS), the peak governing body of university sport in Australia, the Games is the flagship event on the university sporting calendar and attracts over 6,000 competitors each year.
The Australian University Games was created to replace the old style InterVarsity (Or I.V.) competitions that were run by the individual sports. The aim to bring more athletes together in a larger event.
Teams qualify through regional university games. The Northern University Games are for universities from Queensland, Northern Territory and Northern New South Wales. The Eastern University Games are for universities from most of New South Wales and the ACT. The Southern University Games are for teams from Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The Western University Games Series covers teams from Western Australia.
Thus far, The University of Sydney has been the most successful amongst competing universities in the Games, having achieved Overall Winner a total of eight times (1995–1996, 1999–2003, 2007).
The University of Western Australia became the first University outside the big 3 (The University of Sydney, The University of Melbourne, Monash University) to win the Overall title since 1994, when it clinched the 2010 title.
