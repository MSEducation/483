Robbins Island is an island located off the northwest coast of Tasmania separated by a highly tidal area otherwise known as Robbins Passage.

History

The island was part of the territory of the indigenous North West tribe spanning from Table Cape to the western side of Macquarie Harbour, Charles Robbins, first mate of HMS Buffalo was sent by Governor King to dissuade the French commodore Nicholas Baudin, with his two ships the Geographe and the Naturaliste from colonising Van Diemen's Land.
Baudin had revealed French plans to colonise Van Diemen's Land when drunk in a farewell party organised by the Governor, after sailing into Port Jackson where his crew were treated back to health from scurvy. Governor King would not accept French occupation of Van Diemen's Land and chartered a schooner called the Cumberland to which in 13 December 1802, Robbins used successfully, persuading Baudin to abandon French settlement on Van Diemen's Land. The schooner was chartered as larger ships were away and used for other maritime activities.
In 1826 upon European settlement of Tasmania, the Van Diemen's Land Company was set up at Stanley. This company was formed in England by London-based businessmen, who wanted to utilitise land in Tasmania to create a wool industry to supply the British textile industry and due to William Sorrell's account to the Colonial Office that the Tasmanian colony was desperate for capital.   In 1835 under George Robinson, Indigenous people from the Tamanian mainland were removed, including the Parperloihener band from Robbins Island to a reserve on Flinders Island.
