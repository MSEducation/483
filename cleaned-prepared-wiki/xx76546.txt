Campus

Main, East and North campuses

Liberty University's Campus East housing complex consists of 30 multi-story apartment style dormitories, the last six of which were completed in 2007. Rooms in these dormitories have their own kitchens, living room and private baths. A clubhouse offers a swimming pool, billiards room, and a private theater. A tunnel connecting the east and west ends of the campus was completed in 2004. A second tunnel was completed January 2012, and provides pedestrian passage under the Norfolk Southern Railway and access to nearby shopping opportunities.

=Jerry Falwell Library=

In January 2014, Liberty University opened the new Jerry Falwell Library. The four story, 170,00-square-foot building is located behind the Vines Center. The library features a robot-assisted storage and retrieval system for over 250,000 archived items, with room for another 170,000. The robot locates requested items within a large storage room and delivers the items to the front desk. There are also 150 public computers throughout the building for electronic archive research. The library features group study rooms, writable walls, balconies, terraces and a vegetative roof. The $50 million library is part of a larger $500 million building and expansion plan announced by Liberty University.

=National Civil War Chaplains Museum=

The National Civil War Chaplains Museum contains exhibits of clergy members and religious activity during the Civil War era.  It is the only museum in the nation devoted to this purpose.  The mission of the museum is to "educate the public about the role of chaplains, priests, and rabbis and religious organizations in the Civil War; to promote the continuing study of the many methods of dissemination of religious doctrine and moral teachings during the War; to preserve religious artifacts, and to present interpretive programs that show the influence of religion on the lives of political and military personnel." A 501(c)(3) organization, the museum rents space from Liberty University's DeMoss Center. It has 10,000 square feet, with a 50-seat video theatre, archive displays, a research library, and book store.
The museum features Catholic, Protestant, Jewish chaplains (including African American chaplains), publications, and artifacts from both the Union and Confederate militaries. There are several areas in the museum that are given special attention including:
Two new exhibits have been added to the museum as of 2012: "a "mourning room" with period furniture and decorations (including a cross formed from the woven hair of dead Confederate soldiers), and an exhibit on Civil War sharpshooters featuring Rev. Lorenzo Barbour, chaplain to the Confederate Berdan's Sharpshooters."
In September 2012, Liberty University hosted the 16th annual Civil War Seminar. Titled "1862-The Rise of Lee and Grant", the seminar featured presentations on many different Civil War issues, highlighted by lectures on Grant's Mississippi and Vicksburg Campaigns and Lee's Seven Days' Campaign. The event also featured an online simulation of the Battle of Antietam.

=Carter Glass Mansion=

The Carter Glass Mansion is a historic home originally built in 1923 by U.S. Senator Carter Glass a newspaper publisher, politician and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under President Woodrow Wilson as well as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and President Pro Tempore of the Senate during President Roosevelt's era.dhr.gov/registers/Cities/Lynchburg/118-0210_Montview_1987_Final_Nomination. The 1.7 acre estate consists of a 1 1/2 story main building flanked by slightly smaller ells. The 18Â inch walls are constructed of quartz fieldstone quarried from the property and the mansion is covered with a grey gambrel roof. The estate was purchased by Liberty University in the late 1970s as the headquarters of the university administration, including the main office of university founder Jerry Falwell. One of the many reasons for the estate's continued fame is that Falwell died at his desk at the Carter Glass Mansion on May 15, 2007, and his office has been preserved in the same condition ever since. Falwell was buried on the lawn of the mansion and a memorial to Falwell was placed there, overlooking the rest of the campus. The estate now serves mostly as a tourist site for the historically restored mansion as well as the Falwell office, while the upstairs portion of the mansion has been converted to a bed and breakfast for Liberty University guests.

Academics

As of August 2011, Liberty offers 148 residential and online undergraduate programs and among those offered are  Aeronautics,

Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary

Likely the most notable of Liberty University's schools is the Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary (LBTS).  It was founded in 1973, and now offers various degrees for both academic and vocational endeavors.  The degrees available are the Master of Divinity (M.), Master of Religious Education (including Military Chaplaincy), Master of Theology (Th.M.), Master of Arts in Marketplace Chaplaincy, Master of Arts in Pastoral Counseling, Master of Arts in Religion (M.A.R.), Master of Arts in Theological Studies (M.A.T.S.), Master of Arts in Worship Studies, Doctor of Ministry (D.), Doctor of Philosophy in Theology and Apologetics(Ph.D.).  Some of the degrees are available to be completed online, others require residential study, while some are available in both formats.

=Center for Ministry Training=

The Center for Ministry Training is the practical experience requirement for LBTS students.  The requirements are much like internships for other programs with a religious aspect involved in the experience.  Specifically, the CMT includes Ministry Impact and Supervised Field Ministry Experience (SFME).  Ministry Impact asks a Ministry Specialist to speak on practical aspects of ministry in the world today.  Additionally, "the main requirement for completing SFME is completing a minimum of 40 hours of field ministry during each semester."

Zaki Gordon Cinematic Arts Center

Liberty University now offers a Bachelor of Science in Cinematic Arts Degree.  This program is offered in the new Zaki Gordon Cinematic Arts Center.
In the fall semester of 2012, 40 students will be accepted as the inaugural class to major in Cinematic Arts, eventually expanding the number of accepted students to 160.  "During the first year, students will produce and direct a short film and write a full-length screenplay. They also will learn how to produce films for non-conventional and emerging platforms, such as cell phones and YouTube." The executive director of the Zaki Gordon Cinematic Arts Center is Stephan Schultze, a Hollywood veteran who is known for movies such as Far and Away. "Chancellor Jerry Falwell, Jr. said the decision was spurred by the interest shown by current School of Communication students and is inline with Liberty's commitment to future expansion of academic offerings and academic facilities."
The second year culminates in a large-scale theatrical project and a film festival. Students also will be required to write a business and fundraising plan for producing their own screenplay.

College of Osteopathic Medicine

On October 3, 2011, a 12 million dollar grant was sanctioned by the Virginia Tobacco Commission to build a college of osteopathic medicine and expand the health sciences school.

School of Music

In September 2012, Liberty University announced that it will be combining the Department of Music and Humanities with the Department of Worship and Music Studies to form a new School of Music. The school of music will have 32 full-time and 24 adjunct faculty members separated into two distinct centers. The Center for Music and Performing Arts will focus on music education and performance technique, while the Center for Music and Worship will seek to train skilled musicians as worship leaders and specialists within the Christian music industry. The School of Music will be located in a new building being constructed across from the Arthur S. DeMoss Learning Center. The faculty from the School of Music are collaborating with the construction team to optimize the building to their needs. The building will include a new fine arts auditorium for university and community use, and is part of Liberty University's campus transformation initiative. 
In the Fall of 2014, Liberty University The School of Music will be adding several new degree programs, including Bachelor's degree concentrations in both Jazz Studies and Film Scoring (B.M.), and a 36 credit hour Master's degree in Music Education (M.A.). It has also been announced that the department is currently working on a new 45 credit hour Doctor of Worship Studies degree program (D.W.S.).

Enrollment Profile

The acceptance rate for new first-time, full-time students entering Liberty's resident program in 2012 was 24.6%.

Liberty University Online

Liberty University has an internet education component which is called LU Online, previously the Distance Learning Program (DLP). Prior to the launch of its online education component in 2009, Liberty University provided adult learning courses through the LU School of Lifelong Learning (LUSLLL) by way of its External Degree Program. The LUSLLL was Liberty University's fastest growing school at the time with Jerry Falwell forecasting in his 1997 autobiography an enrollment of 40,000 students in the early 21st Century with the expectation of an addition 10,000 students studying on campus at the same time. Both expectations have been surpassed by current enrollment figures. Liberty's online component currently provides degrees from Associates level to Doctorate. The online school runs unilaterally with the semester program offered at Liberty University's campus. One difference with LU Online is that students take 16-week (full semester) classes for a few of their cataloged courses while the remainder are taken in 8-week subterms which are titled B, C, and D. These subterms provide the student with scheduling flexibility through shorter, slightly overlapping sessions. There is a separation at the 600-level and above at which courses are only offered in the B and D terms.

Clubs and organizations

According to Liberty's website, Liberty University Clubs Webpage there are over 100 registered clubs on campus. This number includes a wide variety of clubs, each of which is led by students with the aid of a Faculty Advisor. After the university's revocation of the recognition of the College Democrats provoked controversy (see "Political clubs", below), the university removed official recognition from all political clubs on campus.

Debate

Liberty's Inter-Collegiate policy debate program, formerly led by Brett O'Donnell, was number one in the overall rankings Championships in the National Debate Tournament for 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011.

Finances

In May 2012, Liberty University Chancellor and President Jerry Falwell Jr announced that the school's net assets are worth $1 billion, in part from the success of its online learning program and from accelerated facility expansion. This valuation is a 10-fold increase since 2006 and underscores the rapid expansion the university has recently experienced.
In December 2010, Liberty sold $120 million in facilities bonds, with the proceeds to be used to finance future expansion.
The students at Liberty University received approximately $445 million in federal financial aid money in 2010, the highest total of any school in Virginia and one of the highest in the country.

Controversy

1989 bond issue

In 1989, Liberty University applied for $60 million in low interest bonds through the Lynchburg Industrial Development Authority. After the required public hearing period the bond issue was voted upon by the IDA and approved. Shortly thereafter litigation was brought against the IDA and Liberty University by Americans United (AU) and a decision (Habel vs. Lynchburg Industrial Development Authority) was handed down in 1991 denying Liberty the bond issuance. It was ruled that Liberty was too pervasively religious and therefore was not eligible for the bonds.
This case dealt a severe financial blow to the university which was unable to fund its construction projects needed to sustain its rapid growth. A subsequent case a few years later involving Regent University was decided in a similar manner, but was later overturned. The Virginia Supreme Court reviewed the case and based its decision on a more recent US Supreme Court ruling concerning issues of Separation and Sectarianism. Since then, Regent has received approval for bond funding with the stipulation that it may not fund the Divinity School.

1994 debt buy-out

Sun Myung Moon, founder of the Unification Church and the Washington Times, and his wife Hak Ja Han helped to financially stabilize the university through two of his organizations: News World Communications (an international media firm which publishes the Washington Times and other news media), which provided a $400,000 loan to the university at 6% interest; and the Women's Federation for World Peace, which indirectly contributed $3.5 million toward the school's debt. "$3.5 MILLION GIFT: In November, the Los Angeles Times reported that the Women's Federation for World Peace (WFWP), which is headed by Moon's wife, contributed $3.5 million to Christian Heritage Foundation (CHF) of Virginia for "educational purposes" in 1995."

Biology

Liberty University teaches young Earth creationism as an explanation for the appearance of life on earth. The university works with young Earth creationist organizations including Answers in Genesis.
In the same month, prominent biologist Richard Dawkins was quoted saying the following about Liberty University: "If it's really true that the museum at Liberty University has dinosaur fossils which are labeled as being 3,000 years old, then that is an educational disgrace. It is debauching the whole idea of a university, and I would strongly encourage any members of Liberty University who may be here, to leave and go to a proper university."

Political clubs

On May 15, 2009, vice president of student affairs Mark Hine sent an e-mail to the president of LU's College Democrats, Brian Diaz, revoking the university's recognition of the club. "The Democratic Party platform is contrary to the mission of Liberty University and to Christian doctrine", Hine's e-mail stated, citing the party's positions on abortion and federal funding thereof, same-sex marriage, hate crimes, LGBT rights, and socialism as justification for the dissolution. While the club can still meet on campus, it cannot use the university's name or reserve university facilities.
At a meeting with administration officials, the group was asked to apologize publicly for statements they had made to the media about this controversy. Diaz said he was baffled by the administration's decision, saying, "I want to be able to share the love of Christ, but I guess I can't do that on campus because I'm a Democrat as well." McAuliffe Jumps Into Liberty U/Young Dems Battle, National Journal, Hotline OnCall, May 22, 2009
Chairman of the Democratic National Committee and Democratic ex-governor Tim Kaine and 2009 Democratic gubernatorial candidates Terry McAuliffe, Brian Moran and Creigh Deeds called on the college to rescind the ban.
Liberty University President and Chancellor Jerry Falwell, Jr.,
Liberty's decision led some to question the university's tax-exempt status, and Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service, asking for a review of the university's tax status. Liberty University in turn filed a complaint with the IRS regarding the tax-exempt status of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.org/media/9980/attachments/ltr_au_%20irs_w_media_exhibits.pdf
In late June 2009, Liberty University announced a new policy dealing with all political clubs on campus. The new policy removed official recognition from all political clubs on campus, relegating them to unofficial status. President Falwell said the previously suspended College Democrats "wouldn't have to do anything" to be recognized under the new policy. Along with other stipulations, the policy allows unofficial clubs to use the university's name, but they will not receive any funding from the university.
