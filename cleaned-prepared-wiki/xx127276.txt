State Route 347 (SR 347), also known as John Wayne Parkway, is a  long, northâ€“south state highway in central Arizona.  The route begins at SR 84 and heads north. It passes through Maricopa, meeting SR 238. The route ends at an interchange with Interstate 10 (I-10) south of Chandler. It primarily serves as the major road to Maricopa; much of the road lies within the Gila River Indian Community, with another short stretch through the Ak-Chin Indian Community. The road was built in the late 1930s and established as a state highway in the 1990s. On average, between 4,000 and 35,000 vehicles use the roadway daily.  

Route description

The route begins at an intersection with SR 84 west of Stanfield. It also meets an at-grade intersection with a rail line, owned by Amtrak.
North of this highway, SR 347 passes Honeycutt Road and passes by the Pinal County Justice Court. After an intersection with Edison Road, SR 347 passes several businesses before intersecting SR 238, named Smith Enke Road.
The route is maintained by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), which is responsible for maintaining highways in the state. As part of this role, the department periodically conducts surveys to measure traffic on highways in Arizona. These surveys are most often presented in the form of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is the number of vehicles that use a highway on any average day during the year. In 2009, ADOT calculated that around 4,500 vehicles used the road daily near the SR 84 intersection and about 33,000 vehicles used the route near the I-10 interchange on an average day.

History

The section north of Maricopa, toward present day I-10, was built by 1939. The road headed north toward Tempe to U.S. Route 80. SR 347 was widened from a two-lane road to the four-lane expressway that it is today.
