On April 12, 2010, Eubanks announced on the show that he would be leaving The Tonight Show following its 18th season. Following his departure from The Tonight Show, Eubanks began touring with band mate Marvin "Smitty" Smith on drums and Bill Pierce on sax.
On February 21, 2013, Eubanks had a performance slot on The Tonight Show, and then joined Leno for an interview. As the two talked, it became evident that Leno and Eubanks have kept in touch, at least remotely, since his departure, which dispelled the claims that he left the show because of his anger towards Leno for the Conan O'Brien controversy, as their chemistry was still very much intact.
