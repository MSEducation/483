Nangarhar shares a border with neighboring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa problematic area between Pakistan and Afghanistan , and the two regions share very close ties, with significant travel and commerce in both directions.
The United States armed forces and the multi-national coalition forces, ISAF, are active in the area. The Shinwar district of Nangarhar was the site of the 2007 Shinwar shootings and the Dih Bala district was the site of the Deh Bala wedding party bombing.

Haji Ihsanullah, a member of Hezb-e Islami Khalis,3 initially drove a minivan laden with explosives into one of the five vehicles making up a US convoy, which included three,4 or six,5 humvees, wounding one Marine.6 Sources differ on whether or not hidden gunmen then also opened fire on the convoy.7 US forces then fled the scene of the ambush,4 opening fire on some vehicles for 6â€“16 miles8 while driving along the Afghan street.9
According to several witnesses and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, US Marines responded to the attack with excessive force, firing indiscriminately at civilians passing by on the busy highway, killing elderly men, women, and children. Akhtyar Gul, a local reporter who witnessed the shooting, claimed that the Marines sprayed civilians with machine gun fire even though the Marines were not under attack.10
Associated Press and Afghan journalists claimed that US soldiers confiscated photos and videos of the killings and their aftermath.
Afghans Response
The killings were followed by widespread protests across Afghanistan and drew sharp criticism from President Hamid Karzai.2 The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission contends that, "In failing to distinguish between civilians and legitimate military targets, the U.S. Marine Corps Special Forces employed indiscriminate force," the report said. "Their actions thus constitute a serious violation of international humanitarian standards.

Economy and poppy production

Once Nangrahar was major center of opium poppy production in Afghanistan, the province had reportedly decreased its production of poppy by up to 95% in 2005, one of the success stories of the Afghan eradication program.  However, the eradication program has often left peasant farmers destitute and, in 2006, farmers were reported to have surrendered their children to opium dealers in payment on their debts.

Opium cultivation

The illicit poppy cultivation takes place in Khogiani, Ghanikhil, Chaparhar, Sherzad, Toorghar, Shenwari and other remote districts. The farmers cite the lack of water and also poverty as the reasons for poppy cultivation. Poppy was also cultivated in Goshta District, Lalpura which borders Pakistan; but now the people just cultivate wheat and other legal crops.

Districts

Nangarhar province is administratively subdivided into 22 districts, these are:

Sports

The province is represented in domestic cricket competitions by the Nangarhar province cricket team.  National team member Hamid Hasan was born in the province and he currently represents Afghanistan in international cricket.
The Ghazi Amanullah Khan International Cricket Stadium is the first international standard cricket stadium in Afghanistan. It is located in the Ghazi Amanullah Khan Township, about 15 kilometres outside the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar Province.1
Construction on the stadium began in March 2010 when the foundation stone was laid by Minister of Finance and president of the Afghanistan Cricket Board, Omar Zakhilwal.2 The project, which was developed on 30 acres of land donated by the developer constructing the Ghazi Amanullah Khan Township,3 cost up the first phase of construction $1.8 million. The first phase, which took one year to complete, included the completion of the stadium itself.2 The remainder of the phases will see the construction of a pavilion, accommodation for players and administrative buildings.2 The stadium, which has a capacity of 14,000, was completed before the national team and under-19 team left for Canada and the Under-19 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Ireland respectively. The two sides inaugurated the stadium in a Twenty20 match.2 It is hoped that the stadium will be able to attract international teams to play Afghanistan, who currently have One Day International status until at least 2013.
