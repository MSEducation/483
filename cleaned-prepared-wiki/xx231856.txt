Halves are an ambient/alternative/electronic band based in Dublin, Ireland.
They are composed of Brian Cash and brothers Tim and Elis Czerniak, with additional live member Margie Lewis.

Formation

Halves were formed when Dave (Scanlon - original member), Brian and Tim sat down together and listed bands & composers they admired. They decided on the band's image, including their website & artwork and the visuals of their live shows and had "a very clear manifesto about the kind of sound we wanted and the kind of thing we wanted to do, which not many bands in this country Ireland were doing". Elis joined soon after and work began on their debut release.

Recordings

The band have released two EPs; the self-titled HalvesHALVES - Haunt Me When I'm Drowsy and 2008's seven-track Haunt Me When I'm Drowsy. These were followed by a single - Blood Branches in March 2009 on a split 7" with fellow Dublin band Subplots.
In 2010 their debut album 'It Goes, It Goes (Forever & Ever)' was released to critical acclaim. The album was released in the UK and mainland Europe on the 4th of July 2011. Recorded in the legendary Hotel2Tango studios in Montreal (housed in a former alarm factory beside a freight railroad) and tracked over two sunny weeks in August 2009, the record was created with the use of the studio's vast collection of antique instruments, amps, organs, effects (most of which date from the 1930s). Eleven songs were recorded live, in one large room on 2â€³ reel-to-reel tape by Efrim Menuck (Godspeed You! Black Emperor), Howard Bilerman, and Radwan Moumneh. Guest performers on the record include: Amy Millan (Stars/Broken Social Scene), Katie Kim, Phil Boughton (Subplots), Canadian harpist Elaine Kelly-Canning (Carnival Moon), Irish Chamber brass and string players and twenty-seven members of the Kilkenny Ladie's choir.'It Goes, It Goes (Forever & Ever)' was shortlisted for the Choice Music Prize for Irish Album of the Year 2010.
