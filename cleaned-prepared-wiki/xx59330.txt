Harvey Williams Cushing (April 8, 1869 â€“ October 7, 1939) was an American neurosurgeon. A pioneer of brain surgery, he was the first person to describe Cushing's syndrome.  He is often called the "father of modern neurosurgery."

Biography

Dr. Cushing was born in Cleveland, Ohio. His parents were Bessie Williams and Kirke Cushing, a physician whose family came to Hingham, Massachusetts, as Puritans in the 19th century.; Gill, Caleb Jr.  History of the Town of Hingham, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, Farmer and Brown, Hingham, 1827. Harvey was the youngest of ten children.
As a child, Cushing attended the Cleveland Manual Training School which expanded his interest in science and medicine. The school's emphasis on experimental training and a "physics-focused" approach to education played an important role in influencing Cushing towards a career in medical surgery. The school's manual dexterity training program also contributed to Cushing's future success as a surgeon. Harvey Cushing A Biography. Springfield, Illinois. 1946. Print.
He graduated with an A.B. degree in 1891 from Yale University, where he was a member of Scroll and Key and Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter). He studied medicine at Harvard Medical School and earned his medical degree  in 1895. Cushing completed his internship at Massachusetts General Hospital and then did a residency in surgery under the guidance of a famous surgeon, William Stewart Halsted, at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, in Baltimore.
After doing exceptional cerebral surgery abroad under Kocher at Bern and Sherrington at Liverpool, he began private practice in Baltimore. During his time with Kocher, he first encountered the Cushing reflex which describes the relationship between blood pressure and intracranial pressure. Here, at the age of 32, he was made associate professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and at the hospital was placed in full charge of cases of surgery of the central nervous system. Yet he found time to write numerous monographs on surgery of the brain and spinal column and to make important contributions to bacteriology. He made (with Kocher) a study of intracerebral pressure and (with Sherrington) contributed much to the localization of the cerebral centers. In Baltimore, he developed the method of operating with local anaesthesia, and his paper on its use in hernia gave him a European reputation. In 1911, he was appointed surgeon-in-chief at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. He became a professor of surgery at the Harvard Medical School starting in 1912.
In 1913, he was made an honorary F.R.C.S. (London). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1914. In 1915, before the Clinical Congress of Surgeons in Boston, he showed the possibility of influencing stature by operating on the pituitary gland.
During 1917-9, he was director of U.S. base hospital attached to the British Expeditionary Force in France. While in combat, Cushing served as the head of a surgical unit in a French military hospital outside of Paris. During his time at the French military hospital, Cushing experimented with the use of electromagnets to extract fragments of metallic missile shrapnel that were lodged severely within the brain.

In 1918, he was made senior consultant in neurological surgery for the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe during World War I. He served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, attaining the rank of Colonel (O6). In that capacity, he treated Lt. Edward Revere Osler, who was fatally wounded during the third battle of Ypres. Lt. Osler was the son of Sir William Osler.
Cushing was responsible for the Pulitzer prize-winning biography Life of Sir William Osler. (London: Oxford University Press, 1925)
From 1933 to 1937, when he retired, he worked at Yale University School of Medicine.
Cushing died on October 7, 1939 in New Haven, Connecticut, from complications of a myocardial infarction. Interestingly, an autopsy performed on Cushing revealed that his brain harbored a colloid cyst of the third ventricle.

Legacy

In the beginning of the 20th century he developed many of the basic surgical techniques for operating on the brain.  This established him as one of the foremost leaders and experts in the field.  Under his influence neurosurgery became a new and autonomous surgical discipline.
Arguably, Cushing's greatest contribution came with his introduction to North America of blood pressure measurement.  On visiting colleague Scipione Riva-Rocci, an Italian physician, Cushing was astonished at Riva-Rocci's non-invasive way to measure intra-arterial pressure.  In 1896, Riva-Rocci developed a wall-mounted mercury manometer linked to a balloon-inflated cuff that would measure the pressure needed to compress arterial systolic pressure, i.e. systolic blood pressure measurement.  Riva-Rocci's design was based on a more primitive version developed by French physician Pierre Potain.  Cushing brought back a sample of Riva-Rocci's sphygmomanometer, and blood pressure measurement became a vital sign and its use spread like wildfire across the US and western world as a direct contribution by Harvey Cushing.  Its use remained until Russian physician Nikolai Korotkov included diastolic blood pressure measurement in 1905 (after he discovered the famed "Korotkoff sounds") with his modern sphygmomanometer, which also replaced the mercury manometer with a smaller, round dial manometer.

In 1912 he reported in a study an endocrinological syndrome caused by a malfunction of the pituitary gland which he termed "polyglandular syndrome." He published his findings in 1932 as "The Basophil Adenomas of the Pituitary Body and Their Clinical Manifestations: pituitary Basophilism".
Cushing was also awarded the 1926 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for a book recounting the life of one of the fathers of modern medicine, Sir William Osler. He served as president of the History of Science Society in 1934.The History of Science Society "The Society: Past Presidents of the History of Science Society", accessed 4 December 2013thumb|right|275px|Harvey Cushing, Doris Ulmann 1920s
In 1988, the United States Postal Service issued a 45 cent postage stamp in his honor, as part of the Great Americans series.
Aside from Cushings many accomplishments, he developed many surgical instruments that are still in use today, most notably the Cushing Forcep. This instrument is used to grasp the thick tissues of the scalp during crainal surgery. He also developed a surgical magnet while working with the Harvard Medical Unit in France during World War I to extract bullets from the heads of wounded soldiers.
The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical LibraryDigital Library Collections of the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library at Yale University at Yale University contains extensive collections in the field of medicine and the history of medicine. In 2005, the library released portions of its collection online, including the Peter Parker Collection which consists of a collection of portrait engravings and 83 mid-19th-century oil paintings rendered by artist Lam Qua of Chinese tumor patients, and a biography of Harvey Cushing by John F. Fulton. In 2010, Yale placed on display Cushing's collection of brain specimens.

Family

He married Katharine Stone Crowell, a Cleveland childhood friend, on June 10, 1902. They had five children: William Harvey Cushing; Mary Benedict Cushing who married Vincent Astor and later James Whitney Fosburgh;
