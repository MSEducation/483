Dickinsonia is an iconic fossil of the Ediacaran biota.  It (roughly) resembles a bilaterally symmetrical ribbed oval.  Its affinities are presently unknown; most interpretations consider it to be an animal, although others suggest it may be fungal, or a member of an "extinct kingdom".

Etymology

Dickinsonia was first described by Reg Sprigg, the original discoverer of the Ediacaran biota in Australia, who named it after Ben Dickinson, then Director of Mines for South Australia, and head of the government department that employed Sprigg.

Occurrence

This fossil organism was first discovered in the Ediacara Member of the Rawnslay Quartzite, Flinders Ranges in South Australia. Dickinsonia is also known from the Mogilev Formation in the Dniester River Basin, Podolia, Ukraine
These deposits have been dated to 558-555 Myr.[ref]

From these, it is possible to consider only 4 or 5 of these 9 as valid species:
D. costata. (junior synonyms D. minima, D. spriggi, and D. elongata (holotype)). Unlike other species, D. costata has comparatively fewer, wider segments/isomers.
D. tenuis (junior synonym D. brachina). Strongly resembles D. costata, but differs from it by more narrow and numerous segments, sparingly lengthened oval form of the body.
D. lissa is extremely elongated (up to 15 cm), almost ribbon-like in shape, with numerous thin isomers.  The isomers of the head area are short in comparison with those of the rest of the body. The fossil bears a distinct axial ledge consisting of two parallel bands extending from the head region to the posterior end of the body.
D. menneri (junior synonym Vendomia menneri) is a small organism up to 8 mm in long, and strongly resembles juvenile specimens  of D. costata with its small number of isomers and well-marked head. D. menneri differs from juvenile D. costata by its slightly more elongated form.
D. rex was erected for selected paratypes of D. elongata. This species is represented by only several very big specimens (up to more than 1 m in length), and does not have a distinct determination.  A large size is the major reason for D. rex's species status. Individuals identified as D. rex may simply be large specimens of D. costata and or D. tenuis.

Description

Dickinsonia fossils are known only in the manner of imprint and casts in sandstone beds. The found specimens range from a few millimetres to about 1 metre in length, and from a fraction of a millimeter to few millimeters thick.
They are nearly bilaterally symmetric, segmented, round or oval in outline, slightly expanded to one end (i.e. egg-shaped outline). The segments are radially inclined towards the wide and narrow ends, the width and length of the segments increases towards the wide end of the fossil. The segments are separated by thin ridge or groove along the axis of symmetry into right and left halves. But left and right halves are organized in an alternating pattern according to glide reflection symmetry rather than bilateral symmetry, thus these "segments" are isomers.

Body fossils

As a rule, Dickinsonia fossils are preserved as negative impressions on the bases of sandstone beds. Such fossils are imprints of the upper sides of the benthic organisms that have been buried under the sand. The imprints formed as a result cementation of the sand before complete decomposition of the body. The mechanism of cementation is not quite clear; among many possibilities, the process could have arisen from conditions which gave rise to pyrite "death masks" on the decaying body, or perhaps it was due to the carbonate cementation of the sand. The imprints of the bodies of organisms are often strongly compressed, distorted, and sometimes partly extend into the overlying rock. These deformations appear to show attempts by the organisms to escape from the falling sediment.
Rarely, Dickinsonia preserved as a cast in massive sandstone lenses, where it occurs together with Pteridinium, Rangea and some others. These specimens are products of events where organisms were first stripped from the sea-floor, transported and deposited within sand flow. In such cases, stretched and ripped Dickinsonia occur. The first such specimen was described as a separate genus and species, Chondroplon bilobatum and later redefined as Dickinsonia.
