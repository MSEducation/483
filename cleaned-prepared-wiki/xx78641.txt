Southern Africa is the southernmost region of the African continent, variably defined by geography or geopolitics.  Within the region are numerous territories, including the Republic of South Africa; nowadays, the simpler term South Africa is generally reserved for the country in English."Africa." The Oxford Companion to the English Language (ISBN 0-19-214183-X).  McArthur, Tom, ed., 1992.  New York: Oxford University Press, p. 19 -- quotation reads: "South Africa: This term once referred to the south of the continent generally, but is currently restricted to the Republic of South Africa.  The term Southern/southern Africa, however, generally includes Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe."

Definitions and usage

UN scheme of geographic regions and SACU

In the UN scheme of geographic regions, five countries constitute Southern Africa:
The Southern African Customs Union (SACU), created in 1969, also comprises the five countries in the UN subregion of Southern Africa.Southern African Customs Union (SACU) official website

SADC membership

The Southern African Development Community (SADC) was established in 1980 to facilitate co-operation in the region. It includes:SADC - Southern African Development Community official website

General usage

The region is sometimes reckoned to include other territories:
The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania, though more commonly reckoned in Central and Eastern Africa, respectively, are occasionally included in Southern Africa.
Another geographic delineation for the region is the portion of Africa south of the Cunene and Zambezi Rivers â€“ that is: South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and the part of Mozambique which lies south of the Zambezi River.  This definition is most often used in South Africa for natural sciences and particularly in guide books such as Roberts' Birds of Southern Africa, the Southern African Bird Atlas Project and Mammals of the Southern African Subregion. It is not used in political, economic or human geography contexts because this definition cuts Mozambique in two.

Geography

The terrain of Southern Africa is varied, ranging from forestCowling, R. M. (editor); (et al.) (2004) ''''. Cambridge University Press. .  The region has both low-lying coastal areas, and mountains.
In terms of natural resources, the region has the world's largest resources of platinum and the platinum group elements, chromium, vanadium, and cobalt, as well as uranium, gold, titanium, iron and diamonds.

Economy

The region is distinct from the rest of Africa, with some of its main exports including platinum, diamonds, gold, and uranium, but it is similar in that it shares some of the problems of the rest of the continent. While colonialism has left its mark on the development over the course of history, today poverty, corruption, and HIV/AIDS are some of the biggest factors impeding economic growth. The pursuit of economic and political stability is an important part of the region's goals, as demonstrated by the SADC.
In terms of economic strength, South Africa is by far the dominant power of the region. South Africa's GDP alone is many times greater than the GDPs of all other countries in the region.

Environment

Southern Africa has a wide diversity of ecoregions including grassland, bushveld, karoo, savannah and riparian zones. Even though considerable disturbance has occurred in some regions from habitat loss due to human overpopulation or export-focused development, there remain significant numbers of various wildlife species, including White Rhino, lion, leopard, impala, kudu, blue Wildebeest, Vervet monkey and elephant. It has complex Plateaus that create massive mountain structures along the South African border.

Culture and people

Southern Africa is home to many cultures and people. It was once populated by San, Khoikhoi and Pygmies in widely-dispersed concentrations. Due to the Bantu expansion which edged the previous peoples to the more remote areas of the region, the majority of ethnic groups in this region, including the Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, Northern Ndebele, Southern Ndebele, Tswana, Sotho, and Shona people, BaLunda, Mbundu, Ovimbundu, Chaga and Sukuma, speak Bantu languages. The process of colonization and settling resulted in a significant population of European (Afrikaner, British, Portuguese Africans, etc.) and Asian descent (Cape Malays, Indian South Africans, etc.) in many southern African countries.

Agriculture and Food Security

At the national level, only a few Southern Africa countries produce enough food to meet their own needs (e.g. South Africa), making the rest dependent on their capacity to purchase imported food (e.g. Namibia and Botswana) or on food aid (e.g. Lesotho, Malawi and Zimbabwe).  
Urban food security has been noted as an emerging area of development concern in the region, with recent data showing high levels of food insecurity amongst low-income households. In a study of eleven cities in nine countries: Blantyre, Cape Town, Gaborone, Harare, Johannesburg, Lusaka, Maputo, Manzini, Maseru, Msunduzi (Durban Metro) and Windhoek, only 17% of households were categorized as 'food secure' while more than half (57%) of all households surveyed were found to be 'severely food insecure'.  There is only limited data on the other Southern African countries.
