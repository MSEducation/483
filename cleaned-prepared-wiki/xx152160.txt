La Destra (2008)

More than a year later, on 10 November 2007, Daniela Santanchè resigned from the National Alliance party to join Francesco Storace's new party The Right. The same day, she was appointed official speaker for the party La Santanchè lascia An e va con Storace, 27-12-2007, Corriere della Sera
Santanchè was then the Prime Minister candidate for The Right in the 2008 Italian general election. Along with Flavia D'Angeli (Critical Left) and Fabiana Stefanoni (Communist Alternative Party), she was the first woman to be a candidate for Italian prime minister.
The Right did not acquire the necessary share of votes (4% for the Chamber, 8% for the Senate) to enter the Parliament and Daniela Santanchè therefore ended her parliamentary mandate. After seven years as deputy, she received €65534 as termination indemnities (trattamento di fine rapporto), and €3605 monthly as lifetime allowance. 

Movimento per l'Italia (2008-09)

On 28 September 2008, after arguing with party secretary Francesco Storace, Santanchè left the party. Shortly afterwards, with Diego Zarneri and other former La Destra politicians, she founded the Movement for Italy (MpI) political movement, in order to come closer to Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom.
On 20 September 2009, she appeared with Diego Zarneri at the Eid ul-Fitr religious holiday in Milan. According to Muslims, Santanchè tried to unveil some women, causing a reaction by local men. In her version, Santanchè says she asked the police to apply Italian law, which bans appearing in public with a veil, and that she made no contact with a Muslim woman. Afterwards, she declared she had been assaulted and beaten, but this was denied by Muslim eye witnesses. At the hospital, she was examined and found to have chest bruises, that would take 20 days to heal. Peace Reporter Santanchè's lawyers dismissed the video as a fabrication, releasing a copy of the reports by the hospital and by the police.

Diploma Scandal of 2011

On 22 March 2011, the magazine Oggi published an articleLo scoop di "Oggi": Daniela SantanchÃ© e il suo (falso) master alla Bocconi. Tutti gli aggiornamenti | Focus. Oggi.it. Retrieved on 2013-08-24. stating that although on her resume Santanchè claimed to have an MBA from the Bocconi University, the university itself had no record of having awarded her any such degree. Santanchè did not resign, claimed she was telling the truth and threatened to sue the magazine for libel.  No evidence of her degree has turned up, although it appears that she did attend another, unspecified, course at the university.
