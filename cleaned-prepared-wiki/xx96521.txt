[[Cutter (baseball)]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball pitches, Baseball plays

In baseball, a cutter, or cut fastball, is a type of fastball which breaks slightly toward the pitcher's glove side as it reaches home plate.

Professional practitioners

The New York Yankees' former closer Mariano Rivera, one of the foremost practitioners of the cutter, made the pitch famous, though the pitch itself has been around since at least the 1950s.
When the cut fastball is working correctly, mainly against opposite-handed batters (e.g., a right-handed pitcher facing a left-handed hitter), the pitch can crack and split a hitter's bat, hence the pitch's occasional nickname of "the buzzsaw." Ryan Klesko, then of the Atlanta Braves, broke three bats in a single plate appearance during the 1999 World Series while facing Mariano Rivera. A few switch hitters have even been known to bat right-handed against the right-handed Rivera (the "wrong" side; switch hitters generally bat from the side of home plate opposite to the pitcher's throwing hand).

Popularity and limitations

The cutter has achieved a boost in popularity in recent years due to its use by certain pitchers, such as Dan Haren, as a way to compensate for declining four-seam fastball speed as the pitcher ages. Braves third baseman Chipper Jones attributed the increased dominance of pitchers from 2010â€“2011 to a more prolific use of the pitch, as did Cleveland Indians pitcher Chris Perez.

Retrieved 2 July 2011. By 2011, it was commonly being called the "pitch du jour" in the baseball press.
A backlash developed as the cutter's use became more widespread, due to concerns that a pitcher overusing the pitch could develop arm fatigue.
