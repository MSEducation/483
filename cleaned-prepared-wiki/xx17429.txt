Not all atmospheric re-entries have been successful and some have resulted in significant disasters.

Uncontrolled and unprotected reentries

Of satellites that reenter, approximately 10-40% of the mass of the object is likely to reach the surface of the Earth.
Due to the Earth's surface being primarily water, most objects that survive reentry land in one of the world's oceans. The estimated chances that a given person will get hit and injured during his/her lifetime is around 1 in a trillion.Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies- Spacecraft Reentry
In 1978, Cosmos 954 reentered uncontrolled and crashed near Great Slave Lake in  the Northwest Territories of Canada. Cosmos 954 was nuclear powered and left radioactive debris near its impact site.Settlement of Claim between Canada and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for Damage Caused by "Cosmos 954" (Released on April 2, 1981)
In 1979, Skylab reentered uncontrolled, spreading debris across the Australian Outback, damaging several buildings and killing a cow.
On February 7, 1991 Salyut 7 underwent uncontrolled reentry with Kosmos 1686. Reentering over Argentina, scattering much of its debris over the town of Capitan Bermudez.org, Spacecraft Reentry FAQ:Astronautix, Salyut 7.NYT, Salyut 7, Soviet Station in Space, Falls to Earth After 9-Year Orbit

Deorbit disposal

In 1971, the world's first space station Salyut 1 was deliberately de-orbited into the Pacific Ocean following the Soyuz 11 accident. Its successor, Salyut 6, was de-orbited in a controlled manner as well.
On June 4, 2000 the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory was deliberately de-orbited after one of its gyroscopes failed. The debris that did not burn up fell harmlessly into the Pacific Ocean.  The observatory was still operational, but the failure of another gyroscope would have made de-orbiting much more difficult and dangerous.  With some controversy, NASA decided in the interest of public safety that a controlled crash was preferable to letting the craft come down at random.
In 2001, the Russian Mir space station was deliberately de-orbited, and broke apart in the fashion expected by the command center during atmospheric re-entry. Mir entered the Earth's atmosphere on March 23, 2001, near Nadi, Fiji, and fell into the South Pacific Ocean.
On February 21, 2008, a disabled US spy satellite, USA 193, was successfully hit at an altitude of approximately  fuel tank containing highly toxic hydrazine might survive reentry to reach the Earth's surface intact.
Several governments including those of Russia, China, and Belarus protested the action as a thinly-veiled demonstration of their anti-satellite capabilities. China had previously caused an international incident when it tested an anti-satellite missile in 2007.
On September 7, 2011, NASA announced the impending uncontrolled re-entry of Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and noted that there was a small risk to the public.
