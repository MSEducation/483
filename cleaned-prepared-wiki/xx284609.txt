History

World War Two

During World War Two, Destroyer Squadron 60 consisted two destroyer divisions, the 119th and 120th, under the overall command of Captain William L. Freseman. 
Destroyer Squadron 60 was part of the naval force assigned to Omaha Beach during the Normandy invasion of June 1944.  DESRON 60 subsequently was part of Task Force 129 which carried out the shore bombardment of the French seaport Cherbourg.U.S. Destroyer Operations in WW2, pp. 360–362.
During the Pacific War, Destroyer Squadron 60 initially participated in the Philippines campaign.  The squadron was part of the escort screen for Task Group 78.3, the amphibious assault force that invaded Leyte on October 1944.  The squadron also participated in the ensuing Battle of Ormoc Bay. U.S. Destroyer Operations in WW2, pp. 454–455. On 3 December 1944, during an attack on a Japanese convoy, the Cooper was torpedoed and sunk.  Destroyer Squadron 60 subsequently operated as part of the destroyer screen for Task Group 77.2, the Bombardment and Fire Support Group for the January 1945 Invasion of Lingayen Gulf.
Destroyer Squadron 60 next operated with Task Force 38, the U.S. Third Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force.  On 16–17 February 1945, TF-38 flew air strikes against the Japanese home islands, Bonin Islands, and Volcano Islands to prevent any reinforcements of the Japanese garrison on Iwo Jima.  During this period, Barton and Ingraham collided, and Moale was detached to escort the two damaged destroyers back to Saipan for repairs.
Destroyer Squadron 60 then operated off Okinawa during Operation Iceberg, with Destroyer Division 120 serving as the escort screen for Task Group 52.1, the escort carrier group providing carrier-based close air support to the Allied invasion force. U.S. Destroyer Operations in WW2, p. 493. — came under intense kamikaze attacks during the squadron's operations in the closing months of the Pacific War.

Re-establishment

On 19 February 2003, Destroyer Squadron 60 was re-established as a permanently assigned, forward-based destroyer squadron staff. It was homeported in Gaeta, Italy, the headquarters of the United States Sixth Fleet. At that time, the squadron's mission was described as to provide the Commander United States Sixth Fleet with a permanently assigned, forward-based destroyer squadron staff for the operational control over destroyers and frigates deployed to the Mediterranean Sea.

Commander responsibilities

With the courtesy title of commodore, the commander of Destroyer Squadron 60 (COMDESRON 60) not only oversees U.S. 6th Fleet surface naval warfare operations in the Mediterranean Sea but also throughout Europe and Africa. The squadron commodore also additionally serves as the executive assistant to the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa as well as the NATO commander of Allied Joint Force Command Naples.
Commander Destroyer Squadron 60 conducts combat and/or non-combat operations as Commander Task Force 60 or as Sea Combat Commander, and when directed, as Maritime Interception Operations Commander. Depending on the missions to be undertaken, COMDESRON 60 employs surface warships, submarines, aircraft, SEAL teams, U.S. Marines, U.S. joint forces, and NATO forces assigned to the Sixth Fleet's  area of operations to keep open the sea lines of communications throughout the U.S. European Command's area of responsibility.
The squadron saw two major changes in 2013. On 21 March 2013, the billet of Commander Destroyer Squadron 60 was renamed Commander Task Force 65, with Task Force 65 being the designation for the Sixth Fleet's surface combatant force. In the capacity, COMDESRON 60 supervises the training, readiness, maintenance, schedules, material, supply, discipline, and morale for those assigned BMD-capable destroyers.  Commander Destroyer Squadron 60 continued to command Task Force 65 in a "dual-hatted" role, and both Destroyer Squadron Sixty and Task Force 65 are now based at Rota, Spain.
