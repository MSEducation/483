Traditions

Nickname

Eagles is the third nickname of Georgia Southern University. From 1924 to 1941, the nickname was the Blue Tide. After World War II, athletic teams were referred to as the Professors, as the school was a teachers college. However, in 1959, when the school was renamed Georgia Southern College, a student vote was held to determine the new mascot. Eagles was chosen over Colonels by a narrow margin. 188

Plain uniforms

When the program was revived in 1982, the school did not have a large budget and coach Erk Russell ordered solid blue helmets and asked the players to put a white strip of tape down the middle. The uniforms consisted of plain white pants and blue jerseys without names. Statesboro: Georgia Southern University, 2006. 230. With the subsequent success of the Eagles, the basic simple design of the uniforms has remained the same.

Kickoff Chant

Prior to every kickoff, it is expected all in attendance in unison yell "GO" and when the ball is kicked yell "Blue!  One More Time!"  The phrase 'one more time' was coined by legendary coach Erk Russell.

Yellow School Buses

When the football team was started again in 1981, money was tight. In fact, there wasn't enough money to furnish transportation.  The Bulloch County school system sold two buses for a dollar each to the team.  The buses have been used by the team ever since as transportation to the Allen E. Paulson Stadium.  It has become a rich tradition and many gather before the game to watch the arrival of the yellow school buses and the "Eagle Walk" procession by the team and coaches into the stadium.

Freedom Flight

As part of the pregame ceremonies, Georgia Southern's living mascot, Freedom, a Bald Eagle, makes a flight from the top of the press box down to the field.  It has been described as "the most exciting 30 seconds of college football."

One More Time!

This is the motto of Georgia Southern.  It was coined by Coach Erk Russell after the team's 1986 National Championship when he said, "Hey ladies, hey fellas, hey gentlemen, hey everybody, one more time for the greatest team in America!" The phrase 'one more time' was forever immortalized and to this day is used often.

Georgia...!  Southern...!

This is the most well known chant of Georgia Southern.  It starts by one person, or side of the crowd, yelling "Georgia!" and the other side or person responding "Southern!"

Whose house...? Our house...!

This chant is done in the same fashion as the "Georgia... Southern..." chant.  It used in the same way as the "Georgia... Southern..." chant to make the Allen E. Paulson Stadium the toughest place for Georgia Southern's opposition to play in.

Erk Russell

In 1981, former University of Georgia Defensive Coordinator Erksine "Erk" Russell was hired to restart the football program at Georgia Southern College (as the university was called at the time), a program that had not competed in forty years. Erk Russell became America's winningest coach, leading to the Eagles to three national championships. The Eagles extended Division I's longest home win streak from 26 to 37 games, gaining distinction as the only 15-0 college team of the twentieth century. Russell's final record at Georgia Southern, after his retirement in 1989, was 83-22-1 (.788).tscsports.shtml
Erk Russell addressed the team the night before his shocking and sudden death on September 8, 2006. Georgia Southern University and thousands of friends, family, and fans gathered at Paulson Stadium to mourn the passing of Erk Russell, one of America's most exciting and successful college football coaches.uga.html
Since Russell's departure, football has continued to be prominent at Georgia Southern. Head coach Tim Stowers succeeded Russell and won the 1990 national title, while Paul Johnson added two more in 1999 and 2000 with teams led by all-time Division I rushing leader Adrian Peterson. Former coach of the Eagles, Chris Hatcher, was previously the head coach at Valdosta State University, where he had an all time record of 76-12. In his first season as head coach, Hatcher led the Eagles to a record of 7-4.ncaafootball.php?s=&url_channel_id=36&url_article_id=12720&change_well_id=2

Beautiful Eagle Creek

When Georgia Southern resurrected football in 1981, it lacked tradition. A drainage ditch that the team had to cross several times a day during football practice came to be called Beautiful Eagle Creek by legendary Head Football Coach Erk Russell. When the Eagles traveled to Northern Iowa during the 1985 playoffs, Coach Russell brought along a jug of  Eagle Creek water to sprinkle on the field. The Eagles were victorious and went on to win many national championships with the help of that magical water.  Today, the jug is on display at Georgia Southern University and signs have been erected along the creek.

The Hugo Bowl

In 1989, ESPN was to broadcast a Thursday Night Football game between the Georgia Southern Eagles and the Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders. However, Hugo, a category 4 hurricane, was headed straight towards the coast of Georgia. At the time of landfall, Hugo ranked as the eleventh most intense hurricane to strike U.S. this century, and it delivered the highest ever recorded storm surge on the East Coast. Nevertheless, the decision was made to continue with the game. For safety purposes, an open line was kept between the press box at Paulson Stadium and the National Hurricane Center in Florida. The Eagles went on to defeat MTSU by a score of 26-0 in a classic that will forever be known in Eagle history as the Hugo Bowl.

Baseball

The baseball team is led by head coach Rodney Hennon, who is in his eighth year at Georgia Southern. Georgia Southern played its first year of baseball in 1933.georgiasoutherneagles.pdf?ATCLID=1312642&SPSID=99579&SPID=10900&DB_OEM_ID=18700
