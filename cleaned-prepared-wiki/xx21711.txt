Klyuchevskaya Sopka ( from the Bering Sea. The volcano is part of the natural Volcanoes of Kamchatka UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Klyuchevskaya's first recorded eruption occurred in 1697,Global Volcanism Program: Kliuchevskoi, eruptive history and it has been almost continuously active ever since, as have many of its neighboring volcanoes. It was first climbed in 1788 by Daniel Gauss and two other members of the Billings Expedition. No other ascents were recorded until 1931, when several climbers were killed by flying lava on the descent. As similar dangers still exist today, few ascents are made.
Klyuchevskaya Sopka is considered sacred by some indigenous peoples, being viewed by them as the location at which the world was created. Other volcanoes in the region are seen with similar spiritual significance, but Klyuchevskaya Sopka is the most sacred of these.

2007 eruption

Beginning in early January 2007, the Klyuchevskaya volcano began another eruption cycle. Students from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and scientists of the Alaska Volcano Observatory traveled to Kamchatka in the spring to monitor the eruption. On 28 June 2007, the volcano began to experience the largest explosions so far recorded in this eruption cycle. An ash plume from the eruption reached a height of  before drifting eastward, disrupting air traffic from the United States to Asia and causing ashfalls on Alaska's Unimak Island.

2010 eruption

As early as 27 February 2010, gas plumes had erupted from Klyuchevskaya Sopka (reaching elevations of  to the north-east from the volcano on 3 March.kscnet.shtml

2012 weak eruptions

On 15 October 2012 the volcano had a weak eruption that stopped the following day. Also a weak thermal eruption occurred on 29 November 2012, then stopped again, as all of its neighboring volcanoes Bezymianny, Karymsky, Kizimen, Shiveluch, and Tolbachik erupted more actively and continuously, taking a major magma supply load off of Klyuchevskaya Sopka.

2013 lazy eruption

On 25 January 2013 the volcano had a weak or lazy-type strombolian eruption that stopped the following day. During January 2013, all volcanoes in the eastern part of Kamchatka Bezymianny, Karymsky, Kizimen, Klyuchevskaya Sopka (aka Kliuchevskoi), Shiveluch, and Tolbachik have erupted except Kamen (volcano).

2013 August 15 and October 12 on and off again eruptions

On August 15, 2013 the volcano had another weak strombolian eruption with some slight lava flow that put on an excellent fireworks display before stopping on August 21, 2013 when Gorely Volcano woke-up and started erupting again in relief of Klyuchevskaya Sopka.
On October 12, 2013 The volcano had another three day on and off eruptions with anomalies and short ash plume possibly indicated Strombolian and weak Vulcanian activity. Explosion from a new cinder cone low on Kliuchevskoi's SW flank occurred on October 12. An ash plume rose to altitudes of 6-7 km (19,700-23,000 ft), and drifted Eastward. The eruptions weakened and paused by October 16, 2013.

More 2013 on and off again eruptions

On November 19, 2013 a strong explosion, and observers reported that ash plumes rose to altitudes of 10-12 km (32,800-39,400 ft) and drifted SE. The Aviation Color Code was raised to Red. Later that day the altitudes of the ash plumes were lower and the eruptions weakened and stopped again.
On December 7, 2013 activity at Kliuchevskoi and nearby Kizimen significantly increased, continued during November 29 - December 7, prompting KVERT to raise the Alert Level to Red. Ash plumes rose to altitudes of 5.5-6 km (18,000-19,700 ft) a.s.l. and drifted more than 212 km NE and over 1,000 km E. According to a news article, a warning to aircraft was issued for the area around the volcanoes. Video showed gas-and-steam activity, and satellite images detected a daily weak thermal anomaly. On December 9, the Alert Level was lowered to Green when the eruptions stopped.
