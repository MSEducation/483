The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction (often shortened to The Kinsey Institute) is a nonprofit research institute at Indiana University. It was established in Bloomington, Indiana in 1947. The Institute and Kinsey himself have been the subject of much controversy, initially for engaging in open discussion of sexuality.

History

Formation

The origins of the Kinsey Institute lie in the scientific research of Indiana University professor and entomologist turned sexuality researcher, Alfred Kinsey.  The 1947 creation of the nonprofit institute, originally named the Institute for Sex Research (ISR), was supported by both Indiana University president Herman B Wells and the Rockefeller Foundation, a major financial backer of Kinsey's research. The ISR was established to protect and preserve the confidentiality of Kinsey's data and research materials by creating a secure, permanent repository for them.

Alfred Kinsey was director of the institute from 1947 until his death in 1956. Since then, the institute has had five directors: Paul Gebhard PhD (1956–1982), June Reinisch PhD (1982–1993), Stephanie Sanders PhD (interim director, 1993–1995), John Bancroft MD (1994–2004), and Julia Heiman PhD (2004–present).

Kinsey's directorship (1947-1956)

Shortly after the ISR's establishment, Kinsey's interview based research was published in the 1948 bestsellingBullough, Vern L. Science in the Bedroom: A History of Sex Research. New York: Basic Books, 1994. Print ; 181.  book, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male., Wardell B. Pomeroy, and Clyde E. Martin. Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Co., 1948.

These books were popularly known as the "Kinsey Reports". Sex the Measure of All Things : A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000. Print; 274. Also, in 1950, research materials being shipped to the ISR were seized by U.S. Customs thereby resulting in the federal court case U.S. vs. 31 photographs. This case continued on after Kinsey's death, until it was finally settled in the institute's favor in 1957.  The ruling granted ISR permission to import erotic materials for research purposes.

Instead the institute uses funds obtained from book royalties and fees in addition to donations. A sampling of the broad range of items housed at the institute includes scientific and popular books, pulp magazines, publications from both sexual and anti-sexual organizations, data from Kinsey's original interview project, films, photos, erotic objects, and artwork by both professionals and amateurs.  Items from all over the world are represented in the collection and some objects even date back to the pre-Columbian era. Dr. Kinsey and the Insititute for Sex Research. New York: Harper & Row, 1972.
