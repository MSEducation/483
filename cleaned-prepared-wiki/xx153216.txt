Air Traffic were an English alternative rock band from Bournemouth. Formed in 2003, the band consisted of Chris Wall (piano, lead vocals), David Ryan Jordan (Drums), Tom Pritchard (guitar) and Jim Maddock (bass guitar).
The band's name originated from when they used to rehearse in an industrial unit next to Hurn Airport, where air traffic control signals could be picked up on their amplifiers. The band have received minor success with the release of their single "Shooting Star", which debuted at No. 30 in the UK singles chart, and the release of their debut album, Fractured Life.

History

Formation and Fractured Life (2006-2008)

Chris Wall first met David Ryan Jordan and Tom Pritchard whilst studying at school in Bournemouth in 2003. The band moved to London in 2005, they recruited fourth band member Jim Maddock and began looking for a record deal.
They spent much of August and September 2006 in Rockfield Studio in Monmouth, Wales, recording material for their debut album. Four of the tracks from these sessions were released as an EP on 30 October 2006, which included the single "Never Even Told Me Her Name" which was Zane Lowe's hottest record in the world for a week on BBC Radio 1.
On 24 November 2006, the band were given their first real television exposure when they appeared on Later With Jools Holland alongside such acts as The Killers and Lucinda Williams. They performed both songs from their first release, "Charlotte" and "Just Abuse Me". Later in the year, the band supported Snow Patrol on their UK arena tour. The band were also nominated in the BBC Sound Of 2007 poll.
The band re-released "Charlotte" on 26 March 2007. This marked the band's first move into the charts, with the song reaching number 33 in the UK Singles Chart. The band released their new single, "Shooting Star", on 18 June 2007. The song, prior to its release, met with acclaim; it was Marsha Shandur's (Xfm) and Steve Lamacq's (6 Music) "Single Of The Week" for 4–10 June 2007, as well as Vernon Kay's "Weekend Anthem" for 9–10 June 2007, on BBC Radio 1. Their debut album, Fractured Life, was released on 2 July 2007 to critical acclaim and receiving positive reviews across the board.
The album was named "Album Of The Week" on radio station Original 106 throughout 25 June - 11 July 2007, with several album tracks played all week. A further single, "No More Running Away", was released on 24 September 2007, charting at No. 45.
Air Traffic were one of ten nominees for the 2007 Xfm New Music Award. They attended and played at a ceremony at London's KOKO on 16 January 2008, with The Enemy being the eventual winners. They released non-album single "Come On" on 21 January 2008, as part of an exclusive download with Xfm. Whilst the song was included in the American release of the album, it was available to download for free in the United Kingdom. In April the band embarked on their biggest UK tour to date headlining a sold out Shepherds Bush Empire in London. To support the album's US release, they embarked on a tour with the critically acclaimed Elbow as well their own headline dates. The band also featured on the main stage at the Rock Werchter festival 08 in Belgium alongside R.E.M., Radiohead and Neil Young.
