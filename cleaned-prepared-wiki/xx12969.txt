Electricity

Many key discoveries about electricity were made in the 1830s.  Electromagnetic induction was discovered independently by Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry in 1831; however, Faraday was the first to publish the results of his experiments.
In 1834, Michael Faraday's published his research regarding the quantitative relationships in electrochemical reactions, now known as Faraday's laws of electrolysis.  Also in 1834, Jean C. A. Peltier  discovered the Peltier "effect", which is the presence of heating or cooling at an electrified junction of two different conductors.  In 1836, John Daniell invented a primary cell in which hydrogen was eliminated in the generation of the electricity.
