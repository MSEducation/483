Alex Stewart (born June 28, 1964, in London, England) was a professional boxer, who represented Jamaica at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California.

Amateur career

Stewart was a member of the Jamaican 1984 Olympic team. He was beaten by Sweden's Håkan Brock in the 1/8 final of the heavyweight competition, losing by a 5-0 decision.  A year earlier he won a bronze medal at the Pan American Games. Lost to Michael Bent(t) in a thrilling match in the 1985 Heavyweight Golden Gloves Finals.

Pro career

Nicknamed "The Destroyer", Stewart did just that in the heavyweight ranks, at least early in his career.  Stewart reeled off 24 consecutive wins, all by KO, prior to dropping his first loss to Evander Holyfield.
Stewart is probably best known for being blown out by Mike Tyson in the first round in 1990, and lost to other notable heavyweights of his era, including Michael Moorer, George Foreman, and Oleg Maskaev.
Stewart's loss to Foreman is likely his most notable ring performance.  Although Foreman knocked him down twice, Stewart recovered to lose a narrow majority decision to Foreman, in which Foreman was  badly swollen about the face.
