[[North Korean won]]

CATEGORIES: Economy of North Korea, 1947 introductions

The won (symbol: ₩; code: KPW) is the official currency of North Korea. It is subdivided into 100 chon. The won is issued by the Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Etymology

Won is a cognate of the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen. All three names derive from the Chinese word written (원), which means "round shape." The won is subdivided into 100 chon (전; 錢; McCune-Reischauer: chŏn; Revised Romanization: jeon).

History

The won became the currency of North Korea on December 6, 1947, replacing the Korean yen that was still in circulation.
North Korean won are intended exclusively for North Korean citizens, and the Bank of Trade (무역은행) issued a separate currency (or foreign exchange certificates) for visitors, like many other socialist states. However, North Korea made two varieties of foreign exchange certificates, one for visitors from "socialist countries" which were colored red and hence nicknamed "red won", FECs were used until 1999, then officially abolished in 2002, in favor of visitors paying directly with hard currency, especially the euro.

Dollar peg removed

Since 2001, the North Korean government has abandoned the iconic rate of 2.16 won to the dollar (which is said to have been based upon Kim Jong-il's birthday, February 16) and banks in the country now issue at rates closer to the black market rate. More recent official rates have shown the North Korean won (as of 2 Dec 2013) to be ₩130.740 to the US dollar.com. Retrieved 2010-06-22. However, rampant inflation has been eroding the North Korean won's value. A report by defectors from North Korea claimed that the black market rate was ₩570 to the Chinese yuan (or about ₩4,000 per U.S. dollar) in June 2009. The Color of North Korean Money. Daily NK. In any case, the U.S. dollar and other currencies are still worth more in North Korean won on the black market than officially.

2009 revaluation

The won was revalued in November 2009Ho, Jung Kwon (November 30, 2009). North Korea Replaces Currency. Daily NK.The Wall Street Journal, Wednesday December 2, 2009 North Korea Reissues Won, a Blow to Unofficial EconomyThe Wall Street Journal, Thursday December 3, 2009 North Korea Begins Won Swap, Curfew  North Koreans were given seven days to exchange a maximum of ₩100,000 (worth approximately US$40 on the black market) in ₩1,000 notes for ₩10 notes, but after protests by some of the populace, the limit was raised to ₩150,000 in cash and ₩300,000 in bank savings. 'North Korea revalues currency, destroying personal savings'. The Washington Post. The official exchange rate at this time was around $740 but black market value of the ₩150,000 was estimated to be near $30.   The revaluation, seen as a move against private market activity, wiped out many North Koreans' savings. The Times speculated that the move may have been an attempt by the North Korean government to control price inflation and destroy the fortunes of local black market money traders.  The announcement was made to foreign embassies but not in North Korean state media. North Koreans in shock as cash is 'banned'. The Times. Press TV. December 2, 2009. Information was later carried via a wire-based radio service only available within North Korea. N. Korea's official media silent about currency reform. Yonhap.
As part of the process, the old notes ceased to be legal tender on November 30, 2009, with notes valued in the new won not being distributed until December 7, 2009.  This meant that North Koreans would not be able to exchange any money for goods or services until that date and most shops, restaurants and transport services had been shut down for the week.  The only services that remained open were those catering to the political elite and foreigners which continued to trade exclusively in foreign currency.  The measure had led to concerns amongst North Korean officials that it would result in civil unrest; this was not the case. China's Xinhua news agency described North Korean citizens in a "collective panic";North's currency action shocking to its citizens. Joongang Daily. December 3, 2009. army bases were put on standby and there were unconfirmed reports of public protests in the streets in a handful of North Korean cities and towns that forced authorities to slightly increase the amount of currency people would be allowed to exchange.
Pictures of the new notes were published on December 4, 2009, in the Chosun Shinbo, a North Korean newspaper based in Japan.  Authorities eventually raised the limit to 500,000 won, Chosun said, and promised no probe into savings of up to one million won and unlimited withdrawals if savings of more than one million are properly explained.
In February 2010, some of the curbs on the free market were eased and a senior party official sacked after incidents of unrest.

Coins

Second won

The first North Korean coins for circulation were minted in 1959 in the denominations of 1, 5, and 10 chon. These coins were often restruck with the original dates in later years, however, 1970 and 1974 dates also appear on the 1 and 5 chon. In 1978, 50 chon coins featuring the Chollima horse statue and a rising sun were introduced into circulation during the 1979 currency reform to allow greater flexibility for vendors by eliminating the 50 chon banknote and large amounts of "small change" coinage carried. In 1987, 1 won coins featuring the Grand People's Study House were introduced however, they did not fully replace the 1 won note which remained legal tender. 
When the historic 2.16 peg to the dollar was abandoned in 2001 to allow for greater convertibility the coins began to lose value. Later, a new set of coins was introduced in 2005 in denominations of 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. These coins were less impressive in design compared to the older series, being very plain and generic in design. All circulation coins of the Second Won were struck in aluminum. 
During the Cold War atmosphere of the late 1980s, North Korea developed a special system of marking coins for two groups of foreign visitors. Issued in 1983, these coins were part of the "Pakkundon" convertible series. Coins with no "stars" were for general circulation in North Korea, coins marked with one star were for "socialist visitors", and coins marked with two stars were for designated for "capitalist visitors". A fourth set, intended for collectors rather than circulation, was struck with the word "specimen" in Korean characters in the areas where the stars would be. The specimen set is the least common of the four. Besides the general circulating coins, there are an abundance of different commemorative coins minted in the name of the DPRK. Most, if not all of them are sold to foreign numismatists. Some of these are official, state approved coins, others are not.

Third won

Coins were issued in 10, 50 chon and 1 won denominations in 2002 and 1 and 5 chon denominations in 2008. All denominations are struck in aluminum. These coins feature the national coat of arms on the obverse and flowers, particularly the Kimjongilia and the Kimilsungia, on the reverse.
Initially struck in 2002, the coins were intended for use shortly after the dollar peg was removed from the currency. Inflation became a very sudden reality, however, and the new coins were never released as planned. In 2008, 1 and 5 chon coins were also struck when a plan for monetary revaluation began. The coins were finally released into circulation in December 2009.

Banknotes

The first banknotes of "North Korea" were issued in 1945. These were in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 100 won. These were discontinued shortly after Soviet forces withdrew and recognized the newly independent state.

First won

The first banknotes of this issue came in 15, 20 and 50 chon along with 1, 5, 10 and 100 won in 1947. This currency was later revalued in 1959 at a rate of one new won to 100 old won. The 1959 banknote series was issued in denominations of 50 chon, and 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won.

Second won

In 1979, the currency was again reformed, and a new banknote series was issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. There is ongoing speculation as to why this move was made. All 1959 banknotes were removed from circulation. Circulating coins, however, were not affected by this change.
As explained above, there are two varieties of foreign certificates. For the 1978 banknote series, foreign certificates, called "Pakkundon", meaning "exchangeable money" were implemented by an overstamp and serial number color. These were first released in 1983 in two forms, one for "socialist visitors" and one for "capitalist visitors". Another series was released in 1986. These were issued in all denominations, except for the ₩100 note, presumably because it was assumed by the government that foreigners would not show proper respect for its depiction of Kim Il-sung. These notes were discontinued in 1988 and replaced with a new series of Pakkundon that was more distinguishable and unmistakable from generic circulation currency. 
In 1988, the Bank of Trade (무역은행) (as opposed to the Central Bank) issued two unique series of foreign certificates. They both included 1 chon, 5 chon, 10 chon, 50 chon, ₩1, ₩5, ₩10, and ₩50. The series for "capitalist visitors" was blue-green, while the series for "socialist visitors" was pink. The chon notes had a simple design of patterns and the values, while the socialist won notes depict the International Friendship Exhibition, and the capitalist won notes depict the Chollima statue. bank-note.
Banknotes in circulation for the second won, up to December 2009, were as follows:
In 2006, ₩1,000 and ₩5,000 banknotes were revised, in which the coloured fields behind the text no longer extended all the way to the margins. In 2007, the ₩500 had also been revised in this same manner along with being engraved for the first time to protect against counterfeiting. The ₩100, ₩1,000 and ₩5,000 bills were essentially based on a common design with exactly the same subjects, varied only by colour.

Third won

In 2009, another currency reform was initiated to tackle hyperinflation and black market activities. Unlike previous reforms, the 2009 move sparked a nationwide panic when it was announced there would be a two-week waiting period between the withdrawal of the old currency and the introduction of the new currency, coupled with an exchange limit of only 500,000 old won for each person, effectively wiping out savings. The state eventually pulled back on most exchange limits; however, the revaluation proved to be a failure.
The current series of banknotes of the third won are issued in values of 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1 000, 2 000, and 5 000 won. Kim Il-sung is depicted only on the obverse of the highest denomination, with the 100 won note featuring the Magnolia (National Flower) and other notes depicting generic people or various monuments in North Korea. The exchange rate was 100 second won to 1 third won.faz.html

Other currency used

The BBC reported in 2009 that in some department stores in Pyongyang, the North Korean won is not accepted; and the stores only take Japanese yen and U.S. dollars.
As of November 1, 2012 most stores in North Korea take Euros and Chinese Renminbi.
