The Leading Hotels of the World, Ltd. (LHW) is a luxury hospitality consortium owned by Hotel Representative, A.G. It is the largest luxury hotel collection, with more than 430 hotels and resorts in over 80 countries. Its properties include grand palaces, intimate city hideaways, ancient castles, safari tent villages, and tropical destinations.
LHW is headquartered in New York City, and maintains offices in 25 cities worldwide.

History

The company was established in 1928 under the name "Luxury Hotels of Europe and Egypt".  It initially had 38 member hotels, including Hotel Negresco in Nice, the Mena House in Cairo, and King David Hotel in Jerusalem.
The Leading Hotels of the World started as a reservation service for independent hotels and is now a full-service hotel consortium which supports sales and marketing, advertising and public relations, financial services, quality control, and hotel inspections for its member properties. It is not a hotel chain itself; its member hotels are typically independents, though some are themselves individual properties that are part of chains.
 It currently maintains a network of 24 offices around the world.
In March 2013, it launched a new website that is part of a new digital strategy, and is an aggregation and distribution point for the company's hotel inventory, as well as educational and other content.

Admission

Hotels seeking to join The Leading Hotels of the World must apply for admission. To be considered for inclusion, a hotel must be in the luxury category. Inspection reports based on hundreds of criteria are subsequently filed with the Executive Committee, whose members then vote to accept or reject the candidate property.

In popular culture

A section of the LHW website, "LHW in the Movies", lists 85 films and their corresponding hotels, with behind the scenes stories and anecdotes from filming. Films that feature LHW hotels include The Quiet Man (Ashford Castle), Midnight in Paris (Le Bristol), The Man Who Knew Too Much (La Mamounia), and Notting Hill (The Ritz London).
