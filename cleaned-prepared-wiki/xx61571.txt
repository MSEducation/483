Biography

Early years

Born in Madrid, as a young man he made his living stuccoing walls. He participated in a construction workers strike in 1890 and joined the PSOE in 1894. Upon the death in 1925 of party founder Pablo Iglesias, he succeeded him as head of the party and of the UGT. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. 2003. London. p.39

Political career

Moderate in his positions at the beginning of his political life, he advocated maintaining a degree of UGT cooperation with the dictatorial government of General Miguel Primo de Rivera, which permitted the union to continue functioning under his military dictatorship (that lasted from 1923 to 1930). The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939. London: Penguin Books, 2006; p.17 This was the start of his political conflict with Indalecio Prieto, who opposed all collaboration with the dictatorial regime.
He was Minister of Labor Relations between 1931 and 1933, in the first governments of the Second Spanish Republic, headed by Niceto Alcalá-Zamora, and in that of his successor Manuel Azaña. The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939. London: Penguin Books, 2006; p.21 He enjoyed great popularity among the masses of workers, who saw their own austere existences reflected in his way of life. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. 2003. London. p.39
In the elections of 19 November 1933, the right-wing Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) won power in Spain. The government nominally led by the centrist Radical Alejandro Lerroux was dependent on CEDA's parliamentary support. Responding to this reversal of fortune, Largo abandoned his moderate positions, began to talk of "socialist revolution", and became the leader of the left (Marxist and revolutionary) wing of the UGT and the PSOE. The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939. Penguin Books. London. 2006. p.28 In early October 1934, after three CEDA ministers entered the government, he was one of the leaders of the failed armed rising of workers (mainly in Asturias) which was forcefully put down by the CEDA-dominated government. The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939. Penguin Books. London. 2006. pp.29–32
He defended the pact of alliance with the other workers' political parties and trade unions, such as the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and the anarchist trade union, the Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). Once again, this placed him at odds with Prieto. The Spanish Republic and the Civil War, 1931–1939. Princenton University Press. Pricenton. 1967. pp.206–208. He declared, that he, Largo Caballero "shall be the second Lenin", whose aim is the union of Iberian Soviet republics.spartacus.co.htm
After the Popular Front won the elections in February 1936, president Manuel Azaña proposed that Prieto join the government, but Largo blocked these attempts at collaboration between PSOE and the Republican government. The Spanish Civil War. Reaction, revolution & revenge. Harper Perennial. 2006. London. p.84 Largo dismissed fears of a military coup, and predicted that, were it to happen, a general strike would defeat it, opening the door to the workers' revolution.
In the event, the coup attempt by the colonial army and the right came on 17 July 1936. While not immediately successful, further actions by rebellious army units sparked the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), in which the republic was ultimately defeated and destroyed.

Prime Minister of Spain

On 4 September 1936, a few months into the civil war, he was designated the 134th Prime Minister and Minister of War. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. 2003. pp.392–394. Besides conducting the war, he also focused on maintaining military discipline and government authority within the Republic. The Spanish Republic and the Civil War, 1931–1939. Princenton University Press. Pricenton. 1967. p.341 Nonetheless, the Barcelona May Days led to a governmental crisisPreston, Paul. The Spanish Civil War. Reaction, revolution & revenge.
