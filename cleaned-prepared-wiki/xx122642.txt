Fernando Montiel Martínez (born March 1, 1979 in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, Mexico) is a Mexican professional boxer. Fernando is a former WBO Flyweight, WBO Super Flyweight and WBO and WBC Bantamweight Champion.

Early life

Fernando "Cochulito" Montiel is the youngest child of Manuel Montiel Sr., a former professional boxer and Fernando's current trainer. Fernando has four brothers that are former professional boxers: Eduardo Montiel, Alejandro Felix Montiel, Pedro Montiel and Manuel Montiel Jr. Fernando learned the sport of boxing in his father's gym located in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, Mexico alongside fellow boxer, Jorge "Travieso" Arce.
Regarding his nickname, Fernando has explained that one of his father's sister could not pronounce his father's name, Manuel de Jesus, when she was of younger age, so she called her brother "Cochul." The nickname was later on passed to Fernando in diminutive form, since "Cochulito" roughly translates into "Little Cochul." The nickname has no relation to a rooster, as many have argued.

Boxing style

Fernando Montiel is a hybrid boxer, using accurate punches to slow down his opponent and using swift hand speed and quickness to frustrate his opponents. Montiel's fighting style employs the use of his agility and quick reflexes. He uses accurate punches and crisp 1–2–3 combos to get under the defenses of his opponents. He is also considered to be a "thinking fighter," using his natural boxing instincts, warrior's mentality, and technical boxing supremacy in taking apart his opponents.

Professional career

Early years at Flyweight

Montiel made his professional debut on December 6, 1996, at the age of 16. He accumulated a record of 20–0–1, which included a win over future champion Cruz Carbajal, before challenging WBO Flyweight Champion Isidro García. Montiel won the bout by seventh round TKO to become champion at age 20. He defended the Flyweight title three times against Olympic medalist Zoltan Lunka, former champion Juan Domingo Córdoba and future champion Jose "Carita" Lopez.

Super Flyweight

In his next bout, Montiel moved up to the super flyweight division and defeated WBO Champion Pedro Alcázar. He defended the super flyweight title against Roy Doliguez and also defeated former champion Ruben Sánchez León, but then lost the title to Mark Johnson by majority decision.
Montiel won all three of his bouts in 2004 then regained the WBO title by knocking out Ivan Hernández, who had recently defeated Johnson. Montiel defended his super flyweight title against Evert Briceno (21–2) and Pramuansak Posuwan (29–0–1). In his next bout, he moved up to the bantamweight division and challenged WBO Champion Jhonny Gonzalez, but lost the bout by split decision. Montiel returned to the super flyweight division and continued defending his title by defeating Z Gorres (26–1–1), Cecilio Santos (22–7–2), Luis Melendez (25–2–1), and former champion Martín Castillo (33–2–0). On May 31, 2008, in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, Montiel defeated Luis Maldonado by third round technical knockout to successfully defend his WBO title for the eighth time. Montiel knocked Maldonado down in rounds one and three and the bout was stopped during Montiel's follow-up barrage.[ref]

In his next match, he moved up to the bantamweight division and defeated future champion Juan Alberto Rosas. On March 28, 2009, he defeated Diego Oscar Silva (24–1–3) by third round knock out to win the Interim WBO Bantamweight title. On April 25, Montiel became a three division champion after being elevated to full Bantamweight Champion.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id=19949
On September 12, 2009, Montiel faced fellow Mexican Alejandro Valdez (21–3–2) at the Palenque de la Feria in Tepic, Nayarit. The bout ended via technical draw at the 3rd round. On February 13, 2010, Montiel defeated Filipino prospect Ciso Morales (14–0) via KO at the 1st round, successfully defending his WBO Bantamweight title.[ref]

On April 30, 2010, Montiel faced WBC Bantamweight Champion Hozumi Hasegawa in Tokyo, Japan. Montiel, who was a heavy underdog leading up to the bout, knocked out Hasegawa in the fourth round, putting an end to the Japanese fighter's 5-year title reign. With the win, Montiel unified the WBC and WBO Bantamweight titles.[ref]

On October 30, 2010, Montiel successfully defended his titles against Rafael Concepción. Montiel dropped Concepcion to the canvas twice in the second round before knocking him out in the third round.

=Montiel vs. Donaire=

On October 4, 2010, promoter Bob Arum announced that Fernando Montiel and Nonito Donaire are on course for a February 19, 2011 bout. Before his bout with Donaire, Fernando had a 10 round non title bout against fellow Mexican Jovanny Soto, on December 10, 2010 in Saltillo, Coahuila. Montiel defeated Soto via KO in the second round. 
On February 19, 2011, the fight against Nonito Donaire took place at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, Nevada. Montiel suffered his first TKO loss in the second round. Montiel, who kissed the canvas in the second round, reportedly had a hairline fracture and deep dent in the cheekbone where Donaire's powerful left hook connected. Montiel reported from his native Los Mochis, Sinaloa, Mexico that he did not suffer a fracture and did not have surgery.
Fernando Montiel has announced in Mexican media that he plans to return to the ring in the super bantamweight division, as he had difficulties making the 118 pounds required in the bantamweight division during his fight against Donaire.
