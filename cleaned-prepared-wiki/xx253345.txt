Baseball career

That season, he was one of the best hitters in the league, leading the circuit with 26 triples, 13 home runs, and 87 stolen bases."1896 Atlantic League Batting Leaders". baseball-reference. Retrieved October 24, 2011. His batting average of .351 would end up being his career-high.
Rothfuss continued his good play in 1897. He had batted .323 through 89 games when his release was bought by the Pittsburgh Pirates for $2,000 in July."Newark Nuggets". Sporting Life. August 7, 1897. p. 13. According to one Newark, New Jersey, sportswriter: No more popular player ever left Newark than our "Jack" and the National League scores will be eagerly scanned daily to note his work. With a little experienced coaching at the bat he should be a fixture, as he is fast in every other department of the game. 
Rothfuss made his major league debut on August 2, 1897. He batted .313 during the season's final two months and earned a job as the Pirates' starting first baseman. The League That Failed. Scarecrow Press. p. 131. On August 22, the Newark Sunday Call wrote, "National League papers are unanimous in the opinion that 'Jack' Rothfuss is one of the 'comers' of the big league. Some of them say Newark should feel proud of him. Well, she does.""Atlantic League Notes". Newark Sunday Call. August 22, 1897.
However, Rothfuss never played in the majors after 1897. He had contracted dysentery late in the season."Newark News". Sporting Life. March 26, 1898. p. 14. The following March, Sporting Life reported that "'Jack' has not been himself all winter. He says the water in Pittsburgh is atrocious." In April 1898, Rothfuss' contract was sold to the Western League's Kansas City Blues."Heavy Weeding-Out". Sporting Life. April 30, 1898. p. 12."Kansas City News". Sporting Life.

He was still suffering from dysentery in May, and in early June, a sportswriter in Kansas City wrote:"Newark Nuggets". Sporting Life. May 7, 1898. p. 5. Johnny Rothfuss ... has shown himself to be the worst type of ingrate. He was sick when he came in the spring, and he was placed in the care of physicians at an expense of $175 per month. As soon as the Blues left for the East and Rothfuss was pronounced cured by his physicians he took French leave and nothing has been heard from him since. The United States Government is warned against accepting this man Rothfuss as a volunteer, for he has certainly shown himself to be the rankest kind of a deserter in the face of duty. 
Rothfuss had returned to Newark in late May, and he played for semi-professional teams in New Jersey later that summer."Newark Nuggets". Sporting Life. May 28, 1898. p. 4."News and Comment". Sporting Life. August 20, 1898. p. 5.
