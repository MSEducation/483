Gentleman is a studio album by Nigerian Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti, released in 1973 by EMI. He wrote and produced the album and performed it with his Africa 70 band. The cover artwork's depiction of a monkey's head superimposed on a suited body is a reference to the album's title track, which is Kuti's commentary on the colonial mentality of Africans who adhere to European customs and clothing.

Music and lyrics

The album's title track is Kuti's commentary on the colonial mentality of Africans who adhere to European customs and clothing, as referenced by the cover artwork's collage of a monkey's head on a suited body. Kuti had learned how to play after the departure of Igo Chico from his Afrika 70 band in 1973. "Gentleman" is followed by two jazzy instrumentals—"Fefe Naa Efe" and "Igbe".

Critical reception

In a retrospective review, Allmusic's Sam Samuelson gave Gentleman five stars and called it "both an Africa 70 and Afro-beat masterpiece."
In 2010, the album was bundled again with Confusion by Knitting Factory Records as a part their extensive reissue of Kuti's 45-album discography. Paste magazine's Michaelangelo Matos gave it a score of "9.3/10" and cited it as the "essential twofer" in the reissue series.
