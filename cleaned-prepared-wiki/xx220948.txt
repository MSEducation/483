Jeffrey D. Gramlich is Professor of Accounting and L.L. Bean/Lee Surace Endowed Chair at the University of Southern Maine, and Guest Professor at Copenhagen Business School. He joined the University of Southern Maine in July 2003 after two years as visiting professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business and 13 years as a professor at the University of Hawaii College of Business Administration. He delivers decision-oriented courses in financial accounting and financial statement analysis and valuation. Gramlich organizes the L.L. Bean/Lee Surace Colloquium Series to serve as an interface between current research and Maine business practitioners and students.  His research appears in The Accounting Review, Journal of Accounting and Economics, Journal of Accounting Research, Contemporary Accounting Research, Accounting Horizons, Journal of the American Taxation Association, National Tax Journal, Journal of Accountancy and Journal of Business Finance & Accounting, among others. Gramlich's most publicized research documented whistle-blowing assertions that Chevron, Texaco and the Government of Indonesia colluded to defraud U.S. federal and state governments of an estimated $9 billion in tax revenue. His 2008 ElectionTaxes site, co-produced with Quantrix, enabled potential voters the opportunity to see the personal effects of the tax proposals offered by presidential candidates McCain and Obama (and documented in Gramlich's Knol)--the calculator site generated national recognition and more than half a million unique visitors utilized the site to compare the effects of the candidates' proposals on their tax bills.
