"Jenny & Becky From The Block" is an autobiographical story about the biggest release of Andre Deyo's 12 year career thus far which was done by Jennifer Lopez, then redone by Becky G. The songwriter takes his experiences to the pages of a book (instead of a lyric sheet), as he reveals the ways in which he created "Jenny From The Block" and details his interaction and involvement with its new version by Becky G. The writer tells how there was a Dr. Luke connection between the original song and its "cover" version which prominently featured Jennifer Lopez in the video. The target audience is primarily made up of songwriters, musicians, Jennifer Lopez fans (JLovers), and Becky G fans (Beasters). The book was released independently through Deyo's social media outlets: Facebook, Twitter, Soundcloud and on his official website: andreDEYO.andreDEYO.com
The book is available for free in the following formats: Amazon for Kindle (retrieve on Amazon), Apple's iTunes iBooks for iPhone (retrieve for iPhone) Apple's iTunes iBooks for iPad (retrieve for iPad) and finally in a neutral PDF format readable by all ebook players (retrieve PDF).
In the book's closing pages, Deyo gives info on a new book "Coming Soon" titled "From Songwriter, To Songwriter".
