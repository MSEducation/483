First team

Background

R.E.B.E.L.S. is a team of ex-lawmen on the run from their former peace-keeping organization, L.E.G.I.O.N.. Led by the ruthless Vril Dox, R.E.B.E.L.S. roster includes among others Strata, Borb Borbb, Stealth and Lobo. An alien telepath, who went by the name -of- 'Telepath' was unwillingly part of the team. At first Telepath was imprisoned but was later let free and assists the team.
Vril Dox's insane, super-smart toddler son had taken over Dox's organization and turned it into a ruthless, brainwashing dictatorship. The group escapes the coup in a semi-sentient ship that literally runs off brain power.
Green Lantern, Kyle Rayner, guest-starred in the first issue and was manipulated into killing some of the group's pursuers.
Vril would confront his ex-girlfriend Ignea, who wields flame powers and attempts to burn him to death. John Sin, the leader of a criminal organization called the Blood Circle, causes Vril to become addicted to a certain drug without his knowledge. Vril's shipmates believe he has perished until they hear rumours of his existence from a doctor who had come to treat Garv, the injured husband-to-be of Strata. The Blood Circle is taken down and Sin learns Vril simply plans to replicate the drug until he can wean himself off it.
Further conflict is caused by Borb Borbb who does not know how to keep his romantic feelings for Stealth appropriately restrained.
Captain Comet becomes involved, as he returns to confront what L.E.G.I.O.N. has turned into.
The team is forced to fight old friends, such as Zena Moonstruk, Gigantus and Davroth. Behind the scenes, help comes from old ally Marij'n, who fails in his attempt to stop a brainwashing broadcast. The group also encounters the demonic entity Neron. Borbb willingly sacrifices himself to save the group from brain-harvesting extra-dimensional entities. The team then gains the assistance of a guard captain that had been caught up in their adventures. "R.E.B.E.L.S." #15 (Jan. 1996)
The heroes regain control in the last issue of the series. Dox and Stealth retire to take care of Lyrl, while Captain Comet is placed in charge of L.E.G.I.O.N.
