Western High School is the oldest public all-girls high school in the United States. It is part of Baltimore City Public Schools. Western was named a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence in 2009 and a "Silver Medal High School" by the U.S. News and World Report in 2012.

History

Western was founded on November 1, 1844. On November 1, 1844, Western High School officially opened its doors for the first time in Armitage Hall at 100 North Paca Street in Baltimore. In those two small rented rooms, Robert Kerr, principal and sole teacher, welcomed thirty-six young women. Thus began the unique legacy of Western, a pioneer in women's education in the United States. Before Western was established, there had been no opportunity for Baltimore girls to get an education beyond grammar school. By 1896 Western moved to a new, more expensive building on Lafayette and McCollough Streets. By this time, the girls had opportunities to take clerical courses. After other moves, Western finally opened in its current location at 4600 Falls Road in 1967. Since 1975, Western has been a city-wide magnet program. Students must apply and meet certain entrance criteria to be accepted to Western. The principal of Western is Alisha Trusty, who replaced Eleanor Matthews in the fall of 2010.

Academics

Western has a state-wide reputation for academic excellence. Western offers three academic programs: accelerated college preparatory and college preparatory, and the Teacher Academy. Western's most rigorous academic program is the Advanced College Preparatory Program (the 'A' course) which was established in 1933 by a joint agreement between Western and Goucher College. Within the accelerated college preparatory program, students can finish four years of high school work in grade 9â€“11. During their 12th grade year they are able to pursue advanced placement or college level courses.  Students who graduate from the 'A' course may enter college with advanced standing. The college preparatory program allows students to take honors course in subjects in which they demonstrate strength. The classes of 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 boast a 100% four-year college acceptance rate.

Athletics

The Western Doves field teams in soccer, cross-country, badminton, swimming, lacrosse, dance, tennis, volleyball, basketball, softball and track and field.  The Western basketball team won the Maryland state championships in 1994 and 1995.  They were runner-ups in the state in 1998, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2010. They won 35 or more District IX Baltimore City Championships and have been to State Finals a record 14 times (The Most in Maryland History).  The Western Track and Field team are perennial champions, winning multiple city, regional and state championships. They won 29 Baltimore City Indoor/Outdoor Track Championships, 1995-2007(I) 1990-2005, 2007(O), 27 3A/4A North Regional Indoor/Outdoor Track Championships, 1995-2006(I) 1990-2004, 2006(O) and 3 3A/4A Maryland State Outdoor Track Championships, 2002, 2005-2006. They were 4 times the 3A/4A Maryland State Outdoor Track Championship runnerups, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2004.

Traditions

Western has four sets of traditional class colors. Each class inherits their class colors as freshman.  The colors are:

Graduation

Western High School's graduation is traditionally held on a Saturday in even years and on a Sunday in odd years, in June. This is because it shares an athletic complex (namely the football field) with its brother school, Baltimore Polytechnic Institute. The girls wear white, ankle-length dresses and carry red roses during the commencement ceremony.  For many years now, it has also been customary to release white doves at commencement. The dove, Western's school mascot, symbolizes the Western Lady, flying above the crowd with quiet dignity, gentility, poise, and elegance. The doves released at commencement circle over Western, then fly off, just as the graduates, having completed their Western experience, depart for college.
