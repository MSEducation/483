To tea bag is a slang term for the sexual act of a man placing his scrotum in the mouth of a willing sexual partner for pleasure or onto the face or head of another person. The name of the practice, when it is done in a repeated in-and-out motion, is derived from its passing resemblance to the dipping of a tea bag into a cup of hot water as a method of brewing tea. As a form of non-penetrative sex, it can be done for its own enjoyment or as foreplay.

Oral sex

Along with the penis, the scrotum is sensitive and considered to be an erogenous zone. This makes varying degrees of stimulation an integral part of oral sex for many men.
Its gain in prominence has been attributed to its depiction in the film Pecker, which was released in 1998.
According to columnist Dan Savage, the person whose scrotum is being stimulated is known as "the teabagger" and "the teabaggee" is the one giving the stimulation: "A teabagger dips sack; a teabaggee receives dipped sack."

Social ridicule and harassment

Tea bagging is not always carried out consensually, such as when it is done as a practical joke, which, in some jurisdictions, is legally considered sexual assault or sexual battery.

In video games

Mimicking the act, by repeatedly crouching over a fallen enemy, has become a popular taunt in multiplayer first person shooter video games and platform games, to imply domination, humiliation, or as a teasing joke.  Although considered to be bad sportsmanship, its use has become widespread in gaming.
