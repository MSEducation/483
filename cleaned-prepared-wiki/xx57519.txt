History

Amateur era (1891–1931)

Club Atlético Peñarol was founded on 28 September 1891 by employees of the English-owned Central Uruguay Railway Company of Montevideo (CUR), which had operated in Uruguay since 1878. Of the company's 118 employees 72 were English, 45 were Uruguayan and one was German.
In 1892, the CURCC shifted its focus from cricket and rugby to football. The football club's first game was against a team of students from the English high school and ended with a 2–0 victory. In 1895, Uruguayan footballer Julio Negrón was chosen as the team's first non-English captain.
In 1900 the CURCC was one of four charter members of the Uruguay Association Football League,
In 1908, the club left the Uruguayan league after the league rejected their request to replay a game with F.C. Dublín. CURCC had lost 2–3 on the road, and believed their poor showing was due to refereeing mistakes caused by pressure from rabid home fans. Back in competition the following year, relations between the CUR and the club became frostier after fans burned a train car used for rival teams.
A year after the club's 1911 Uruguayan championship, the club attempted reforms to its policies. Proposals included greater participation by non-CUR players and a name change to "CURCC Peñarol". In June 1913, the proposals were rejected; the company wanted to distance itself from the club's local reputation. The CURCC approved a November sale of the football club, and on 13 December 1913 the club separated completely from the company (but kept the name "CURCC Peñarol").

CURCC Peñarol is the official continuation of the club founded in 1891, a version accepted by FIFA, UEFA and Conmebol. The club was congratulated on its 120th anniversary in September 2011 by presidents Joseph Blatter, Michel Platini However, Nacional fans contend that CURCC Peñarol was distinct from the older club.
On 12 March 1914 CURCC changed its name to Club Atlético Peñarol, a change submitted to the Uruguayan Football League two days later and approved the following day. During its first years under the new name Peñarol was not successful, although a new stadium (Las Acacias) opened on 19 May 1916. The club won its first two league titles under the new name in 1918 and 1920.
In November 1922 the Asociación Uruguaya de Fútbol (AUF) disqualified Peñarol because the club played an exhibition game with the Racing Club de Avellaneda, a club affiliated with the Asociación Amateurs de Football in Argentina and not the Asociación Argentina de Football.
After its first European tour in 1927, Peñarol won the Uruguayan championship in 1928 and 1929; the following year, the club defeated Olimpia 1–0 in its first game at the Centenario Stadium in Montevideo.
 

Professional era (1932–present)

In 1932, Peñarol and River Plate played the first game of the professional era. Peñarol won the first Uruguayan professional championship with 40 points, five more than runners-up Rampla Juniors. After placing second in 1933 and 1934, the club won four consecutive league tournaments between 1935 and 1938; they also won the 1936 Torneo Competencia.
The club stayed in second place until 1944, when Peñarol again won the Uruguayan Championship (defeating Nacional in a two-game final, 0–0 and 3–2).
After placing second in 1950, Peñarol won the Uruguayan Championship the following year;
Their 1959 championship qualified Peñarol for the recently created Copa Libertadores, an international competition then known as the Copa de Campeones de América. Peñarol won the first two tournaments, beating Olimpia of Paraguay in 1960 Peñarol won three more league titles (1960, 1961 and 1962), for five consecutive championships.
After a quiet year in 1963, Peñarol won the Uruguayan Championship in 1964 and 1965 and the Copa Libertadores in 1966, defeating River Plate 4–2. Copa Libertadores all-time top scorer Alberto Spencer played for Peñarol at this time.
In 1970 the club again reached the Libertadores final again, losing to Estudiantes de La Plata. The club set a tournament record for greatest goal difference, defeating Valencia of Venezuela 11–2. With Fernando Morena as the team's star, the club won the Uruguayan championship for three consecutive years, from 1973–1975. After placing second in 1976 and 1977, Peñarol won again in 1978. That year, Morena set two records: most goals scored in a Uruguayan season (36) The 1970s ended with another championship in 1979. Morena was top scorer in the Uruguayan tournament six straight times, and top Copa Libertadores scorer in 1974 and 1975.
After beginning the 1980s with a third-place finish in 1981, Peñarol won the Uruguayan Championship with Fernando Morena and Rubén Paz (the tournament's top scorer). The next season the club again won the Copa Libertadores, defeating Cobreloa of Chile 1–0 on a goal from Fernando Morena
Despite financial problems during the 1980s, Peñarol won the national championship in 1985 and 1986, and a fifth Copa Libertadores in 1987. The club defeated América de Cali 1–0 with a goal by Diego Aguirre in the final seconds of extra time, when a tie would have gone to the Colombians on the goal differential. It was the third Copa Libertadores won by Peñarol at the Nacional de Chile, following victories in 1966 and 1982.
Peñarol celebrated its hundredth anniversary in 1991, despite a controversy ignited by archrivals Club Nacional de Football concerning Peñarol's 1913 name change. With Pablo Bengoechea and the young Antonio Pacheco on the team and Gregorio Pérez behind the bench, Peñarol again won the Uruguayan championship five straight times (1993–1997). The club also reached the Copa Conmebol final in 1994 and 1995, rounding out the century with a national championship in 1999 (defeating Nacional 2–1 in the final, despite Julio Ribas on the bench).
The next year, Peñarol lost the Uruguayan championship final against Nacional; many of the team's players were jailed after a tournament fight.

Crest and colors

Badge

Uniform

Since its founding, Peñarol's colors have been yellow and black. They were inspired by the Rocket locomotive designed by George Stephenson, which won an award in 1829.
The first jersey was a plain shirt, divided into four square sections which alternated black and yellow.
The first alternate uniform is believed to have been a squared jersey, similar to the club's first main shirt but with orange instead of yellow. In 1984 a jersey with horizontal stripes (instead of vertical) was worn, and 1987 featured a yellow jersey with black shorts. Other alternate uniforms (used recently) have been completely black, grey or yellow. Special jerseys have been worn for international friendlies, especially during the 1960s. The CURCC's main uniform (with two halves, one plain and one striped) is used as a third uniform. On 4 February 2013 all-black and all-yellow alternate uniforms were introduced.

Supporters

In Uruguayan football, loyalty to Peñarol or Nacional divides the country. The clubs are evenly matched, and have a large fan base. Many surveys of public opinion have been conducted, but none have been conclusive. In 1993 the Factum consulting firm reported that Peñarol was the favorite team of 41 percent of football fans, while 38 percent supported Nacional.
MPC Consultants surveyed 9,000 Uruguayans; Peñarol had 45 percent of the supporters, and Nacional 38 percent. An online survey on the webpage Sportsvs.35 percent and Peñarol with 49.45 percent.

Fan club

Rivalries

The Uruguayan Derby between Peñarol and Nacional goes back to 1900, the oldest football rivalry outside the British Islands. Including the amateur and professional eras, league and friendly games, the teams have met 511 times in the past with 182 victories to Peñarol, 166 to Nacional and 163 ties.
A notable game for Peñarol fans is occurred on 9 October 1949 in the Uruguayan Cup first round, and is known as the Clásico de la fuga (the "escape derby"). At the end of the first half Peñarol was leading 2–0, but at halftime Nacional decided not to return. While Peñarol fans believe that Nacional did not want to be defeated by a Peñarol team known as the Máquina del 49 ("Machine of 49"), Nacional supporters claim it was a protest against poor officiating.
On 23 April 1987 Peñarol and Nacional were tied 1–1 with 22 minutes remaining when three Peñarol players (José Perdomo, José Herrera and Ricardo Viera) were ejected after a foul and subsequent protests. Peñarol then had to face a full Nacional team with only eight players on the pitch. With eight minutes remaining Diego Aguirre set up Jorge Cabrera, who scored the winning goal. This win by the aurinegro was known as the Clásico de los 8 contra 11 (the "8 against 11 derby").
Peñarol and Nacional have faced each other in the final game of the Uruguayan Championship twelve times, with Peñarol winning eight. The most recent was in May 2010, when Peñarol won the championship 2–1.

Current staff

Administration

During a meeting presided over by Roland Moor on 28 September 1891, it was stipulated that responsibility for the Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club would belong to the principal administrator of the Central Uruguay Railway Company of Montevideo. The first president of the club was Frank Henderson, who remained in that office until 1899.
After Henderson CUR administrators remained as chairmen of the sports club until 1906, when Charles W. Bayne took over the CUR. Bayne refused to sponsor the CURCC because of vandalism by fans and absenteeism by workers. He was replaced by CUR employee Roland Moor.
Conflicts remained between the company and the sports club, which resulted in the separation of CURCC's football section from the company and a name change to Club Atlético Peñarol. Jorge Clulow, an Englishman with Uruguayan nationality, was chosen chairman of the club; he remained in office from 1914 to 1915.
