Slovenia selected its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010, which was held in Oslo, Norway, through the EMA contest, organised by Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTV SLO). The winner of the contest, held on 21 February, was Ansambel Roka Žlindre and Kalamari with the song "Narodnozabavni rock" (Popular folk rock), which received 15,907 votes, almost five times as many votes as runner-up Nina Pušlar.

EMA 2010

RTV SLO launched an open call for songs for the competition. All interested parties could submit entries until 14 December, with all songs sung in the Slovene language. An appointed jury selected 14 songs to progress to a semi-final (EMA Predizbor). A number of these songs were to progress to the final (EMA Izbor), where they would be joined by seven songs submitted by prominent local composers invited by the broadcaster.
EMA 2010 introduced a number of new features to the contest: for the first time the winner was decided solely by the televoting public; during the selection of the songs by a jury, special number and letter codes were used to identify the songs, rather than the names of the authors; and all songs were to be sung in the Slovene language, both in EMA and at the Eurovision Song Contest - this is due to certain legal restrictions made on RTV SLO to promote the Slovene language, despite controversy among professional and public audiences, and debates on the authors' artistic rights, and promotion of Slovene culture in foreign languages.
RTVSLO announced the 14 semi-final participants on 18 December, selected from 111 submitted entries.
Over three weeks 90 second clips of the 21 songs were performed by the artists on TV show Spet doma. The first seven songs from the semi-final were performed on 31 January,
