CATEGORIES: Electoral Districts of the Congress of Deputies (Spain), Province of Tarragona

Tarragona is one of the 52 electoral districts () used for the Spanish Congress of Deputies - the lower chamber of the Spanish Parliament, the Cortes Generales. It is one of four electoral districts which correspond to the provinces of Catalonia. Tarragona and Reus are the largest municipalities.

Boundaries and electoral system

Under Article 68 of the Spanish constitution Spanish Constitution
the boundaries must be the same as the province of Tarragona and under Article 140 this can only be altered with the approval of congress. Voting is on the basis of universal suffrage in a secret ballot. The electoral system used is closed list proportional representation with seats allocated using the D'Hondt method. Only lists which poll 3% of the total vote (which includes votes "en blanco" i.e. for none of the above) can be considered. Under article 12 of the constitution, the minimum voting age is 18.

Eligibility

Article 67.3 of the Spanish Constitution prohibits dual membership of the Cortes and regional assemblies, meaning that candidates must resign from Regional Assemblies if elected. Article 70 also makes active judges, magistrates, public defenders, serving military personnel, active police officers and members of constitutional and electoral tribunals ineligible.

Number of members

From the 1977 onwards Tarragona returned five members. This figure was increased to six members for the 1993 election and it has remained at that figure since then.   
Under Spanish electoral law, all provinces are entitled to a minimum of 2 seats with a remaining 248 seats apportioned according to population. (Ley Orgánica del Régimen Electoral General) The practical effect of this law has been to overrepresent smaller provinces at the expense of larger provinces. In 2004 for example Spain had 34,571,831 voters giving an average of 98,777 voters per deputy.2004 Spanish election In Tarragona however the number of voters per deputy was only 86,098.2004 Tarragona election

2004 General Election

The 2004 election saw Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) more than triple their vote to gain a seat from CiU. PSOE regained the seat that they had lost to the PP in 2000. The latter election was the only election to date when the PP managed to win more than one seat here in what is one of their weakest areas. PP's voteshare of 17% was one of their worst in the entire election, with only the other three Catalan provinces and Guipúzcoa producing worse vote shares for them.
