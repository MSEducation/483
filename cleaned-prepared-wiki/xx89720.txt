[[Ductus arteriosus]]

CATEGORIES: Embryology of cardiovascular system

In the developing fetus, the ductus arteriosus (DA), also called the ductus Botalli, is a blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta. It allows most of the blood from the right ventricle to bypass the fetus's fluid-filled non-functioning lungs. Upon closure at birth, it becomes the ligamentum arteriosum.  There are two other fetal shunts, the ductus venosus and the foramen ovale.

Clinical significance

Patent ductus arteriosus

Failure of a child's DA to close after birth results in a condition called patent ductus arteriosus and the generation of a left-to-right shunt. If left uncorrected, patency leads to pulmonary hypertension and possibly congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Prostaglandins are responsible for maintaining the ductus arteriosus by dilation of the vascular smooth muscles.
The E series of prostaglandins are responsible for maintaining the patency of ductus arterisus (DA) throughout the fetal period. This allows the ductus arteriosus to close, so that the normal post-natal circulation of the heart can commence. 
If the child has certain congenital heart defects such as Transposition of the great arteries, they may have prostaglandins administered to them to maintain the patency of the ductus arteriosus until surgery can be performed. This is necessary, so that the blood can continue to circulate and become oxygenated, until the congenital defect can be corrected.
Closure may be induced with NSAIDs because these drugs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis.
The ductus arterisous may remain patent after birth. In this case non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will be used to close the DA.
A patent ductus arteriosus affects around 4% of infants with Down syndrome (DS). A failure to thrive is a very common sign of this condition. "Medical Genetics at a Glance". Blackwell Publishing. 2010. p63.
