In the beginning of 2012, people of foreign background and their descendants were estimated to have formed 25% of the total population.npdata.htm
Of these 'New Belgians', 1,200,000 (49%) are of European ancestry and 1,350,000 (51%)
Since the relaxation of the Belgian nationality law more than 1.3 million migrants have acquired Belgian citizenship and are now considered new Belgians. 89.2% of inhabitants of Turkish origin have been naturalized, as have 88.4% of people of Moroccan background, 75.4% of Italians, 56.2% of the French and 47.8% of Dutch people.
In 2007, there were 1.38 million foreign-born residents in Belgium, corresponding to 12.9% of the total population. Of these, 685 000 (6.4%) were born outside the EU and 695 000 (6.5%) were born in another EU Member State.L'IMMIGRATION EN BELGIQUE. EFFECTIFS, MOUVEMENTS. ET MARCHE DU TRAVAIL. Rapport 2009.

Total fertility rate

The total fertility rate (TFR) gradually increased during the last decade from 1.60 in 1997, 1.65 in 2002 and 1.82 in 2007. The rates in Brussels are higher than the national average (1.79 in 1997, 1.93 in 2002 and 2.09 in 2007), while they are below the average in Flanders (1.54 in 1997, 1.56 in 2002 and 1.77 in 2007), due to Brussels having relatively more Muslims and Africans and Flanders relatively fewer.fgov.jsp

Ethnic groups

The country is populated by a Flemish majority of about 6,000,000 people speaking Dutch, a French-speaking minority of 4,100,000 people, and about 73,000 German speaking people in Wallonia, near the German border. However, David Levinson reports that "the Flemish and Walloon groups are described by experts as "communities" rather than as ethnic groups, and individuals can move easily from one community to the other by learning to speak the other language".
The largest group of immigrants and their descendants in Belgium are Moroccans, with more than 450,000 people, which is well over 4% of Belgium's total population. The Turks are the third-largest group, and the second-largest Muslim ethnic group, numbering 220,000.be,  2007
The rest consists mostly of French-speaking people from Brussels, Italians, Dutch, French, Portuguese, Spaniards, Algerians, Congolese, Poles, and Indians. (Around 23% of Belgium's population is of non-Belgian origin)
The exact number of French-speakers in Brussels is hard to determine, but it is estimated that 77% of the people living in Brussels use French and 16% use Dutch in their households, as the sole language or secondary language. See the Brussels article for more details.

Languages

Belgium's three official languages are Dutch, spoken by 59% of the population, French, spoken by 40%, and German, spoken by less than 1%. The vast majority of Belgium's population, 99%, is literate as defined by the Belgian government, i.e. capable of reading and writing in an official language by the time a citizen has reached the age of 15.

Religion

Most, 75% of Belgians, are nominally Roman Catholic. Protestant, Muslim, agnostic, atheist and other minority religions comprise 25% of the population.
