History

Brooke founded Trinity College and Theological Seminary and in mid-1978, Trinity moved to Evansville, Indiana, and changed its focus from offering traditional on-campus degree programs to its current emphasis on distance education, providing undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate courses for self-directed adult learners. Trinity offers various distance education learning formats and delivery systems, such as self-paced independent study courses, online courses, webinars, and face-to-face seminars on-campus and at other locations in the United States.Warrick County (Indiana) Assessor's Web Site

Accreditation

Trinity is not accredited by any accreditation association in the United States. 
In January 1992, Trinity achieved "accreditation" with the National Association of Private Nontraditional Schools and Colleges, a now defunct organization that is not recognized as an accreditor by the United States Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. Bear. Bear's Guide to Earning Degrees by Distance Learning, pg. 57. As such, its degrees and credits might not be acceptable to employers or other institutions, and use of degree titles may be restricted or illegal in some jurisdictions.ED.).College Accreditation in the United States - TOC
Prior to 2002, Trinity pursued endorsement of its courses with the University of Liverpool. In 2002, Liverpool decided to "transfer the accreditation role to a theologically orientated institution" after consultation with the QAA. In the United Kingdom, the QAA oversees the Academic Infrastructure of institutions, which includes frameworks for higher education qualifications, code of practice, subject benchmark statements, and programme specifications.QAA Academic Standards and Quality
In 2004, Trinity was granted candidacy status with the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. The institution provided a self-study report, hosted a team of North Central Association evaluators for a site visit, and expected a second campus visit in autumn 2006. However, Trinity resigned from candidacy status effective October 20, 2006. Initially the reason for being denied accreditation was for course work that was "too challenging", but ultimately Trinity did not have enough "financial stability reserve."
From 2002 to 2007, Canterbury Christ Church University endorsed courses and programmes offered by Trinity. The endorsed courses and programmes were subject to the university's "academic and quality-assurance processesCanterbury Collaborative Provision but students did not receive its degrees or awards."
In August 2007, Trinity received support for set courses and programmes by the University of Wales. Validation with the university is awarded to an institution developing and delivering a programme of study equivalent to the quality and standard followed by the university. To be awarded validation, Trinity was required to document and satisfy all quality assurance standards as outlined by the university, which includes QAA national standards related to the framework for higher education qualifications, programme specifications, subject benchmark statements, and code of practice. A validation site visit of Trinity by a panel of assessors appointed by the university was also required for Trinity to demonstrate evidence of the attainment of said standards.Validation Unit Quality Handbook - Contents
At the time of validation in 2007, there was no requirement for the university to work only with accredited institutions.K. institutions they should not form collaborative relationships with institutions not accredited in their home country. This prompted the university to begin to question their collaborative relationship with Trinity. Although Trinity successfully completed the validation process in order to achieve validation, in November 2008 the university cut ties with Trinity.
In 2008, Trinity applied for accreditation with the Distance Education Training Council (DETC), which is recognized by the CHEA and the USDE. On October 7, 2011, DETC denied initial accreditation to Trinity citing Trinity's "failure to demonstrate compliance with Standard IX (Financial Responsibility)" as the reason for DETC's denial. Trinity's comments also noted that Trinity had complied with all other requirements, including all academic standards, for DETC accreditation and that Trinity would continue seeking accreditation.
