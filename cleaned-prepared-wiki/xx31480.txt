Life insurance policies on slaves

In 2000 Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, head of the nonprofit Restitution Study Group of Hoboken, New Jersey, disclosed that from approximately 1853 to approximately 1860 Aetna had issued life insurance policies to slaveowners covering the lives of their slaves.
Aetna acknowledged that concrete evidence exists for Aetna issuing coverage for the lives of slaves and released a public apology.
In 2002, Farmer-Paellmann brought suit against Aetna and two other companies in federal court asking for reparations for the descendants of slaves. The lawsuit said Aetna, CSX and Fleet were "unjustly enriched" by "a system that enslaved, tortured, starved and exploited human beings. " It argued that African-Americans are still suffering the effects of 2½ centuries of enslavement followed by more than a century of institutionalized racism. The complaint blamed slavery for present-day disparities between blacks and whites in income, education, literacy, health, life expectancy and crime.
This suit was denied, and the denial largely upheld on appeal.
In 2006, Farmer-Paellmann announced a nationwide boycott of Aetna over the issue of reparations for its policies covering slaves. Aetna stated that its commitment to diversity in the workplace and its investment of over 36 million dollars in such areas as education, health, economic development, community partnerships, and minority-owned business initiatives in the African-American community is more effective at aiding descendants of slaves and African-Americans in general than making restitutions for Aetna's life insurance policies on slaves."Aetna Statement Regarding Slavery Reparations Lawsuit", Aetna press release, March 27, 2002"Slavery Reparations Issue", Remarks Delivered by Aetna Chairman John Rowe at the Aetna Shareholders Meeting, April 26, 2002"Aetna boycott is misguided", The Hartford Courant, November 23, 2006"Questions and Answers Regarding Slavery Reparations and Aetna's Support of Diversity", Aetna press release"Judge's Order In re African-American Slave Descendants Litigation", District Judge Charles Ronald Norgle, July 6, 2005"Decision on Appeal In re African-American Slave Descendants Litigation", December 13, 2006
