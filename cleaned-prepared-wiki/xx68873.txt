Background information

During 1993, TLC re-entered the studio with Dallas Austin, Tim & Bob, Jermaine Dupri, Babyface, Organized Noize, and Sean "Puffy" Combs to record their second album into 1994.
The album moved away from the rap elements from their previous album, in favour of a smoother, seductive, R&B/soul sound. It relied heavily on the vocals from Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins and Rozonda "Chilli" Thomas, and featured fewer rap vocals by Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes.
The title refers to the personalities of the members that make up the group; "Left Eye" representing the "crazy", "Chilli" being the "sexy", and "T-Boz" being the "cool". Together, the three words make "CrazySexyCool".

Reception

Critical response

Rolling Stone, in their review for The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, stated that TLC "emerged with the most effervescent and soulful girl-group R&B anyone had seen since the Supremes".rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/tlc-crazysexycool-20120524
In 2010, Rolling Stone listed the album at number 43 on their "100 Greatest Albums of the 90s".  They stated: "Left Eye, Chilli and T-Boz looked like a one-shot when they first emerged from the nascent Atlanta with 1992's Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg. But CrazySexyCool was a real shocker, packed bumper to bumper with great songs, sassy vocals and voluptuous beats for burning down the house. "Creep" celebrates the kicks of illicit lust on the down low, "Waterfalls" digs deep into Memphis soul and "If I Was Your Girlfriend" does Prince better than The Artist has all decade. The showstopper: "Red Light Special", an impossibly steamy make-out ballad that undresses and caresses everyone with ears to hear it. CrazySexyCool  established TLC as pop pros who could do it all, combining the body slam of hip-hop and the giddy uplift of a jump-rope rhyme without breaking a nail."
