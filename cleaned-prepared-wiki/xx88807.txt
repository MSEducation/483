Development

Templeogue was originally a small village in the rural, southern part of County Dublin. In Elizabethan times it was owned by the Talbot family, who later became prominent as the owners of Mount Talbot. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was owned by the Domviles who controlled access to Dublin's main water supply, the River Dodder, which passed through their estates. In 1801, the Templeogue Road was constructed, originally as a toll road. Urban expansion of Dublin during the 1950s and '60s absorbed the village.

Amenities

The suburb has many open fields (such as Orwell Green, Glendown Green and Rossmore Green), and sports clubs — Faughs GAA Club, St. Judes GAA Club, St. Mary's College RFC, Templeogue Swimming Club, Templeogue Tennis Club, and Templeogue United Football Club.

Our Lady's Secondary School, St. Pius X National School, Bishop Galvin National School and Bishop Shanahan National School.
The Roman Catholic parish church is St. Pius X which opened on 27 November 1960 on College Drive.
Although surrounded by pubs in adjacent neighbourhoods, Templeogue has only one pub inside its boundaries, The Templeogue Inn, also known as The Morgue. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway passed through Templeogue so close to the pub that many deaths occurred. Corpses were often sheltered in the pub until taken away and the pub acquired the permanent, morbid nickname. The Templeogue Inn was the most expensive pub in Ireland for a time when it changed hands on 12 October 1983 for IR£660,000, a remarkable sum at the time.
Dublin Bus operates the following bus routes through Templeogue: 15, 15B, 15E, 15F, 49, 49A, 49N, 54A, 65, 65B, and 74.

The poet Austin Clarke lived in Bridge House beside Templeogue Bridge which spanned the River Dodder. After his death, there was a proposal to preserve the house and his library of 6,500 books as a memorial. This was not possible owing to long-term plans to demolish the house and widen the road. The old Templeogue Bridge, built in 1800, and Bridge House were removed and a new bridge was opened by Councillor Mrs. Bernie Malone, Chairman Dublin City Council on 11 December 1984, which was renamed Austin Clarke Bridge in his honour.
