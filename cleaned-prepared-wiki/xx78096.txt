[[Flag of the Republic of the Congo]]

CATEGORIES: Flags of Africa, National symbols of the Republic of the Congo

The Flag of the Republic of the Congo is a flag consisting of a yellow diagonal band divided diagonally from the lower hoist-side corner, with a green upper triangle and red lower triangle.  Adopted in 1959 to replace the French Tricolour, it was the flag of the Republic of the Congo until 1970, when the People's Republic of the Congo was established.  The new regime changed the flag to a red field with the coat of arms of the People's Republic in the canton.  This version was utilized until the regime collapsed in 1991.  The new government promptly restored the original pre-1970 flag.

History

Under French colonial rule over French Congo, the authorities forbade the colony from utilizing its own distinctive colonial flag.  This was because they were worried that this could increase nationalistic sentiment and lead to calls for independence.
The new flag was officially adopted on September 15, 1959 and remained unchanged when the French Congo became an independent state less than a year later on August 15, 1960.  It was hoisted on top of the building that formerly housed the French high commission to mark the proclamation of independence.
The red flag remained in place until 1991, when economic problems and the weakening of the Soviet Union's power due to the Revolutions of 1989 culminated in democratic elections and ultimately, the collapse of the People's Republic of the Congo.  The National Conference, which oversaw the transition to a democratic government, reinstated the original flag from 1959 on June 10, 1991.
