OpenOffice. In August 1999, StarDivision was acquired by Sun Microsystems
On 19 July 2000 at OSCON, Sun Microsystems announced that it would make the source code of StarOffice available for download with the intention of building an open-source development community around the software and of providing a free and open alternative to Microsoft Office.); the final release of OpenOffice.0 was on 1 May 2002.

In June 2011, Oracle contributed the trademarks to the Apache Software Foundation.

Governance

During Sun's sponsorship, the OpenOffice.org community members. The Community Council suggested project goals and coordinated with producers of derivatives on long-term development planning issues.
Both Sun and Oracle are claimed to have made decisions without consulting the Council or in contravention to the council's recommendations,

Naming

The project and software were informally referred to as OpenOffice since the Sun release, but since this term is a trademark held by Open Office Automatisering in Benelux since 1999, OpenOffice.
Due to a similar trademark issue (a Rio de Janeiro company that owned that trademark in Brazil), the Brazilian Portuguese version of the suite was distributed under the name BrOffice.Org being the name of the associated local nonprofit from 2006.)

Features

OpenOffice.0 was launched under the following mission statement:

The latest versions of OpenOffice.org on other operating systems were:

Fonts

Development

OpenOffice.
The OpenOffice. It consisted of a wide range of interfaces defined in a CORBA-like interface description language.

Native desktop integration

OpenOffice.0 was criticized for not having the look and feel of applications developed natively for the platforms on which it runs. Starting with version 2.0, OpenOffice.
The issue had been particularly pronounced on Mac OS X. Early versions of OpenOffice.app or XDarwin (though the NeoOffice port supplied a native interface). Versions since 3.0 ran natively using Apple's Aqua GUI.

Use of Java

Although originally written in C++, OpenOffice.
The issue came to the fore in May 2005, when Richard Stallman appeared to call for a fork of the application in a posting on the Free Software Foundation website. OpenOffice.org would run on free implementations of Java and fixed the issues which previously prevented OpenOffice.0 from using free-software Java implementations.
On 13 November 2006, Sun committed to releasing Java under the GNU General Public License and had released a free software Java, OpenJDK, by May 2007.

Security

Market share

Problems arise in estimating the market share of OpenOffice. The project tried to capture key adoption data in a market-share analysis, listing known distribution totals, known deployments and conversions and analyst statements and surveys.
According to Valve Corporation, as of July 2010, 14.63% of Steam users had OpenOffice.
A market-share analysis conducted by a web analytics service in 2010, based on over 200,000 Internet users, showed a wide range of adoption in different countries: 0.2% in China, 9% in the US and the UK and over 20% in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Germany.
Although Microsoft Office retained 95% of the general market — as measured by revenue — as of August 2007,
The project claimed more than 98 million downloads as of September 2007
