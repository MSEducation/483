[[Lundu (dance)]]

CATEGORIES: Brazilian styles of music, Dance in Brazil

Background

Lundu (also spelled landu or landum) is a style of Afro-Brazilian music and dance   with its origins in the African Bantu and Portuguese people.

History

The interconnectedness of Lusophone countries dates back to the Atlantic Slave Trade, between Portugal, Brazil and regions of Africa.

Dissemination

Records from the inquisition of the 18th century reveal that the Europeans initially considered gandus and lundus to be witchcraft. 
Gradually, the lundu style grew in popularity among the elite population in Brazil.

Style

Lundus are characterized by varying structure, the interplay of tonic and dominant harmony, and strummed chords layered atop a syncopated rhythm reminiscent of traditional West African music. Limited recordings are available of traditional lundus style. Usually a flirtatious ritual of a couple dance, accompanied by a guitar, or sometimes a thumb piano or drums, Lundu is related to the Spanish fandango and other new-world dances like the Argentine Zamba, Cueca and Bolero - they all involve, to some degree, handkerchiefs, castanets, and holding one's arms above one's head. In the 19th century, the lundu was one of the sources of the Choro, the Maxixe and the Samba
