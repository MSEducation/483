He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria. The main tradition in the Western world is usually called classical music. In this regard, it is frequently used as a contrasting term to popular music and traditional or folk music."Music" in Encyclopedia Americana, reprint 1993, p. 647.

Definition

This term is mostly used to refer to music descending from the tradition of Western classical music. This is the common definition referred by many musicologists and scholars including Susan McClary,Susan McClary,Feminine Endings: Music, Gender, and Sexuality, second edition, (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1991-2002): xv-xv Lawrence Kramer,Kramer Lawrence, Musical Meaning: Toward a Critical History, Volume 1 (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2002): 81 & 203.

Adorno, Richard D. Leppert, and Susan H. Gillespie Essays on Music (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2002): 665. Both terms ("art music"/"serious music") are dealt as equivalents in the context of the book and this is reflected in the index of the book: the "art music" entry is reported on the "Serious Music" entry of the index (cf. Theodor W. Adorno, Richard D. Leppert, and Susan H. Gillespie Essays on Music (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2002), 717).Gregory D. Booth and Terry Lee Kuhn, "Economic and Transmission Factors as Essential Elements in the Definition of Folk, Art, and Pop Music", The Musical Quarterly 74, no. 3 (1990): Many of these authors, however, tend to be critical or prudent with respect to certain implications of this classification. Those authors most particularly associated with critical musicology movement and popular music studies like Tagg tend to reject latent social elitism that has sometimes been associated with this classification.
Some other authors interested in music theory may define art music differently. Musician Catherine Schmidt-Jones for example defines art music as "a music which requires significantly more work by the listener to fully appreciate than is typical of popular music." In her view, "this can include the more challenging types of jazz and rock music, as well as Classical."Catherine Schmidt-Jones, "What Kind of Music Is That?", from the website Connexions, last edited by Catherine Schmidt-Jones on 10 Jan 2007 8:58 am US/Central, retrieved on 12 December 2008.
While often used to refer primarily to Western historical classical music, the term may refer to:
While earlier musicological approaches tended to consider art music in an elitist way, asserting the superiority of art music over other forms of music (for example AdornoTheodore Gracyk, "The Aesthetics of Popular Music", The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Accessed 13 June 2011).), many modern musicologists (most particularly ethnomusicologists) dispute the notion of superiority. In a recent international musicology colloquium dedicated to music and globalization,Colloquium "Musique et globalisation"
Furthermore, many art music composers have made reference to popular music including Johann Sebastian Bach, Milton Babbitt, Ludwig van Beethoven, Leonard Bernstein, Vincent D'Indy, Guillaume Dufay, George Gershwin, Josquin des Prez, Darius Milhaud, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Manuel M. Ponce, Arnold Schoenberg, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and William Walton, while others like Béla Bartók, Pierre Boulez, Johannes Brahms, John Cage, Claude Debussy, Antonín Dvořák, Lou Harrison,  Zoltán Kodály, François-Bernard Mâche, Gustav Mahler, Olivier Messiaen, Maurice Ravel, Steve Reich, and Claude Vivier have drawn influence from regional or extra-European traditional music.
Moreover, in some cases the distinction between popular and art music has been blurred, particularly in the late 20th century.

Characteristics

The term primarily refers to classical traditions (including contemporary as well as historical classical music forms) which focus on formal styles, invite technical and detailed deconstruction and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In strict western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition, preserved in some form of music notation, as opposed to being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings (like popular and traditional music). Historically, most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe beginning prior to the Renaissance period and reaching its maturity in the Romantic period.  The identity of a "work" or "piece" of art music is usually defined by the notated version, rather than a particular performance of it (as for example with classical music).
However, other cultural classical traditions may refer to oral transmission. Treatises on the structural and theoretical considerations underlying Indian classical music have been available for millennia, notably the Natyashastra of Bharata, dated to between 200 BC and 200 AD. Some Western classical composers, notably Messiaen, relied on Indian rhythmic frameworks for their rhythmically more sophisticated compositions.1 (1987): 117–44, here 117 et passim.
In some western modern or experimental forms, the written notation of art music may depart from standard musical notation and use a variety of new types of notation to facilitate the exploratory nature of these new forms of music. In other words, while the notation may not be formal or traditional, there remains an element of formality or intellectual discipline to the construction and communication of the content of the work.
