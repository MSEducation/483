Ben Ratliff of The New York Times as a R&B almanac of shaky romance, with nearly every song a first-person narrative with gnarled details, endlessly recombining data about suspicion, jealousy, pride, punishment, self-respect, the led-up, the aftermath."

MC Lyte, The female MC that rhymes in such a way that you don't care if she was male or female...Queen Latifah, She represented the strong female MC, she showed us and taught us about flow and lyrical dexterity.
