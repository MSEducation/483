Philanthropy and conservation

Kohler and his wife have been leaders in the largely successful efforts to save Trumpeter Swans, Whooping Cranes, and Siberian Cranes from extinction.bringbackthecranes.html At one point the couple responded to an appeal by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson to fly swan eggs from Alaska to Wisconsin in a company plane, and continued to do so for the better part of a decade.    On a number of occasions they have also flown Whooping Crane eggs from Ft. Smith in the Northwest Territories of Canada to the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, WI. On another occasion, they brought eggs from Alaska to Michigan. The Kohlers also flew a company jet to the farthest reaches of Siberia and clear across Russia around the world to help Russians preserve the rapidly disappearing Siberian Crane. In recent years, they have been part of the ultra-light led Whooping Crane Recovery Project between Wisconsin and Florida. The couple wrote in 2007 that their experience in this field "has provided almost weekly excitement in our lives for nearly 20 years."David Sakrison, Chasing the Ghost Birds: Saving Swans and Cranes From Extinction (International Crane Foundation), 2007), p. viii In 2009, they were awarded the Charles Lindbergh Award which "is given annually to individuals whose work over many years has made significant contributions toward the Lindbergh's concept of balancing technology and nature."
