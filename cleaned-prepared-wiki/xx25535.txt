The Atlantic City Surf were a professional baseball team based in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The Surf was most recently a member of the Can-Am League, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball. The Surf played its home games at Bernie Robbins Stadium, which was formerly known as "The Sandcastle".
From 1998 to 2006, the Surf played in the South Division of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.  While in the Atlantic League, the Surf won the first-ever Atlantic League championship in 1998 while also hosting the inaugural Atlantic League All-Star game.
On March 30, 2009, the Atlantic City Surf organization ceased operations, leaving the Can-Am League with six teams. Players from the team were made available in an April 3, 2009 dispersal draft.

Earlier Atlantic City Baseball Teams

Atlantic City historically has never enjoyed much success as a venue for professional sports teams and baseball has been no exception. The city hosted a few short-lived, unnamed teams in various leagues in the 19th century, then provided a home for the defunct Lancaster Red Roses of the Tri-State League in 1912. The franchise played one more season in Atlantic City in 1913 before disbanding.

Bacharach Giants

In 1916, the Bacharach Giants moved to Atlantic City. Originally known as the Duval Giants of Jacksonville, Florida, its name was changed to the Bacharach Giants in honor of the city's mayor, Harry Bacharach. The team was independent from 1916 to 1922, then became a member of the Eastern Colored League from 1923 until the league's folding during the 1928 season, winning the league in 1926 and 1927 under the leadership of Dick Lundy.

Atlantic City Surf

In 1998, the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball placed a team in Atlantic City called the Surf. Opening their new ballpark called The Sandcastle on May 20, the Surf was defeated by the Somerset Patriots by a score of 8 to 5. Playing host to the first Atlantic League All-Star game on July 15, the Surf defeated the League All-Stars 6 to 4 and would later win the league's first Championship Series over the Bridgeport Bluefish, three games to one. The Surf made it to the post-season four times in five years (2002 and 2004â€“06) but were eliminated in the first round each time.
In 2007, the Surf moved play from the Atlantic League to the Can-Am League.  In 2007 the Surf made the playoffs in their inaugural season in the Can-Am. The team managed by Chris Carminucci finished with the 2nd best overall record of 51-41. In the playoffs lost to the North Shore Spirit 3 games to 1 in the opening round.  The Surf received many awards in 2007. Carminucci received manager of the year. Starting pitcher Brian Rodaway received Pitcher of the Year Award after finishing a league-best 15-3.  Relief pitcher Matt Pike received  the Reliever of the Year award for his league leading 24 saves. In 2008 the Surf hired Cecil Fielder as the team manager. The Surf continued their success finishing 51-43 (4th overall record) and once again in the playoffs, this time losing to the Quebec Capitales 3 games to 1 in the opening round.
On March 30, 2009, the Can-Am League announced that the Surf would not be operating for the 2009 season because of the collapse of the proposed sale of the team and the lack of ownership to continue for the 2009 season.  The Surf joined fellow league member Ottawa Voyageurs in ceasing operations for the 2009 season.
