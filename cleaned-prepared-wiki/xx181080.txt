Biglow Canyon Wind Farm is an electricity generating wind farm facility in Sherman County, Oregon, United States. It is owned by Portland, Oregon based Portland General Electric and began operations in 2007. With the completion of phase 3 of the project it has a generating capacity of 450 megawatts. It is located roughly five miles (8 km) northeast of Wasco, Oregon, and about ten miles (16 km) southeast of Rufus, Oregon. Biglow Canyon Wind Farm covers  in the Columbia River Gorge.

History

In 2005, Orion Energy announced plans to develop a 450-megawatt wind farm with 225 turbines at Biglow Canyon in the Columbia River Gorge, at the time the largest project of its kind in Oregon. Wind farm in gorge may blow others away. The Oregonian. August 1, 2005. Portland General Electric (PGE) acquired Orion's development right to the $200 million project in 2006. PGE power project rides on the wind. The Oregonian. April 12, 2006. In November 2006, PGE purchased the first 76 turbines for the project from Vestas, with the project cost increasing to an estimated $256 million for the first phase. PGE has the wind and adds the mills. The Oregonian. November 28, 2006. PGE broke ground on the site in February 2007. In the middle of October 2007, ten Vestas V82 wind turbines were energized to produce the first electricity at Biglow. Demand for wind dwarfs supply. The Oregonian, November 9, 2007. The last of the 76 turbines in the first-phase of the wind farm development became operational in December 2007. Renewable Energy Access. Retrieved on 2009-01-26.
The turbines for phase 2 and 3 were purchased from Siemens Energy. There will be 141 SWT-2.3-93 turbines, with a capacity of 2.3 MW each. The Engineer Online. Retrieved on 2009-01-26. Phase 2 of the project was completed in August 2009, adding 65 turbines to the wind farm.

Operations

The Biglow Canyon Wind Farm has an installed capacity of 275 megawatts. Additional phases, planned for construction in 2009 and 2010, are expected to bring its total generating capacity to between 400 and 450 megawatts. The site covers  in Sherman County. The wind farm uses a feeder transmission line from the canyon to high-voltage transmission lines via a power substation located near The Dalles.  See 
  [/ref] PGE does not own this line. Additionally, the line connects this and other wind farms to the Bonneville Power Administration run power grid built for use with the hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River.

Certification

The facility is authorized to install up to 225 wind turbines totaling 450 MW and averaging 150 MW distributed over  wide on private farmland leased from the appropriate landowners. The initial construction—termed phase I—provides a completed capacity of 125 MW or enough to power 34,000 homes.  Phase I cost some $250 million.  Energy Trust of Oregon, Inc. contributed $6 million.
Turbine output is around 600 VAC and is converted to 34.5 kV by a transformer at the base of each tower.  The output is gathered by a substation which combines the individual turbine contributions.  Most collector cabling and associated control and monitoring fiber optic cable (up to 99 miles) is buried  of aerial cabling is permitted.  Bonneville Power Administration built a 12 mile 230 kV transmission line to collect the power.  It has capacity for an expected additional 450 MW from two other proposed wind farms in Sherman County.
The substation may be up to  including transformers, switching equipment, maintenance shops, control room, and offices. As many as ten meteorological observation towers up to 279 ft (85 m) are allowed throughout the wind farm to collect wind resource data. Construction must be completed by June 30, 2011.
Visual impact restrictions are in force for the John Day Wildlife Refuge, John Day Wild and Scenic River, and the John Day State Scenic Waterway (from Parish Creek to Tumwater Falls).  Wildlife protection must be provided for nesting bald eagles, peregrine falcons, Swainson's hawk, golden eagle, Burrowing owl, Ferruginous hawk and minimization of harm to other wildlife. Noise levels during construction and operation of the facility must not contribute more than 50 dBA at 24 identified noise sensitive sites.
