M-95, designated the Leif Erickson Memorial Highway, is a state trunkline highway in the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. Running from Kingsford to near Champion in Humboldt Township, it is the main connection between Iron Mountain and Marquette along with US 41.
M-95 was previously designated as M-45. The number was switched when US 45 was designated in Michigan. The trunkline incorporates a portion of the former M-12 which became US 2. A section of the highway near Republic was turned over to Marquette County during a rerouting of the highway in the 1940s, becoming County Road 601.

Route description

Starting on a bridge across the Menominee River, M-95 runs north along Carpenter Avenue in Kingsford. It turns east along Ludington Street in Iron Mountain and joins the US 2/US 141 concurrency out of town to the north, following Stephenson Avenue. Near the state line northwest of Iron Mountain, M-95 turns northward as a solo route through northern Dickinson County. There is a concurrency with M-69 from Randville to Sagola. Randville is just south of the junction with M-69 where the mining settlement formed because of the nearby Groveland Mine and was a station on the Milwaukee and Northern Railroad in 1880. A post office was in operation in Randville from 1891 until 1932. 
Near Sagola is a mill owned by Louisiana-Pacific that makes oriented strand board. The surrounding forest lands near the highway provide trees for the mill.
M-95 crosses the Michigamme River at the Marquette County line. It is here that M-95 also crosses over from the Central Time Zone to the Eastern Time Zone at the county line south of Witch Lake. From there it bypasses Republic and the former Republic Mine Complex to the west. Republic is divided into two smaller communities of North Republic and South Republic by the mine complex. Known for its sandy beachfront along the Michigamme River west of downtown North Republic, the beach is located just upstream of the Republic Dam. In South Republic is a roadside park maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) that provides a picnic area and canoe access to the river. M-95 comes to an end at an intersection named "Koski's Korner".

History

From its inception until 1934, M-95 held the M-45 designation. It was renumbered to avoid confusion with the then new US 45 designation in the Upper Peninsula. The original M-95 was an access route to Onaway State Park which was redesignated as M-211.
The original roadway that became today's M-95 started in Sagola and run northward to M-15 (today US 41/M-28). M-45 was extended by 1927 to replace portions of M-12 that were not used in US 2. The total of M-45 was converted to M-95 in 1934 as a realignment near Witch Lake is completed.
M-95 was rerouted in 1942 from Republic north to Humboldt Township. This new
