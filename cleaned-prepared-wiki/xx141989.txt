In Miami she reached the second round by defeating Nuria Llagostera Vives, before losing to first seed Maria Sharapova.
Chan finally found her footing after entering the clay court season. In Charleston, she qualified into the main draw, and stunned No. 39 ranked Séverine Brémond in two sets to set up a rematch against reigning Australian Open and Miami winner Serena Williams.

However, they lost the final to 2006 Roland Garros champions Raymond / Stosur in straight sets. Had they won the final match, they would have beaten every 2006 Grand Slam champion team in one single event.
