The students called this move illegal and contrary to the Kampala Declaration which grants academic freedom. They arrested YFD members, including the President "Black Moses" who is still missing.
On Saturday, September 24, 2011, Chasowa was found dead at the Polytechnic campus with a deep cut on his head and lying in blood. Inspector General of Police Peter Mukhito noted that he was identified by the leader of the student group, "Black Moses", as the author and distributor of anti-government newsletters which prompted him to commit suicide due to fear. Police say he left a note stating he was killing himself because "politics are dangerous."
