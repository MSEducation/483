The Porsche Cayenne is a mid-size luxury crossover manufactured by the German manufacturer Porsche since 2002, with North American sales beginning in 2003. Its platform was developed by Porsche and is shared with the Volkswagen Touareg. It is the first V8-engined vehicle built by Porsche since 1995, when the Porsche 928 was discontinued. Since 2008, all engines have featured direct injection technology. The Cayenne's chassis type numbers are as follows: Type 955 (2002–2006), Type 957 (2007–2010), and Type 958 (2011+).
The second-generation Cayenne (Type 958) was unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show in March following an online reveal. Although the Cayenne shares its platform, body frame and doors with the similar Volkswagen Touareg, all other aspects of vehicle design, tuning and production are done in-house at Porsche.

However, it soon proved that it was the performance vehicle among SUV's and was praised for its excellent handling and powerful engines. The lineup initially consisted of the V8-powered Cayenne S and Cayenne Turbo. Later in the model cycle, VR6 and diesel-powered versions joined the lineup.
The base model is powered by a 3.2 L VR6 engine producing ; modifications in the exhaust manifold allow power to peak at 6700 rpm.

Second generation

The current Porsche Cayenne went on sale around November 2010 as a 2011 model, with an official debut at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. In preparation for the unveiling, the Cayenne production facility in Leipzig, Germany, closed in December 2009 in order to commence factory retooling for the new model, a process that took 2–3 months.
The first spy photos of the car were posted on the internet on June 5, 2008. 
The 2011 Porsche Cayenne is visually shorter and smaller than its predecessors with more muscular curves, a more slanted rear window and less upright windshield, a more sloping roofline, door-mounted mirrors, smaller windows at the rear of the vehicle, headlights inspired by the Carrera GT, taillights that extend onto the car's tailgate, LED daytime running lights and a vastly redesigned interior modeled after the Panamera.
The Cayenne is again the first of the three new SUVs from the VW group; the new Volkswagen Touareg will be 6–12 months behind, while the next-generation Audi Q7 is due in 2013. Standard features of the 2011 Porsche Cayenne include air conditioning with dual-zone climate controls, interior air filter, tilt/telescopic leather-wrapped steering wheel w/radio controls, cruise control, leather upholstery, 8-way power front seats, outside-temperature indicator, and universal garage door opener in the base model. The Cayenne S adds a power sunroof and memory for the driver's seat.
The Cayenne GTS added an optional rearview camera, keyless access and start, and memory system. Finally, the most upscale Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S added a navigation system w/voice recognition, premium sound system, optional 4-zone climate controls, heated rear seats, and 6-disc CD changer.

Hybrid

At the IAA 2005, Porsche announced it would produce a hybrid version of the Cayenne before 2010 (Porsche Cayenne Hybrid). Two years later, at the IAA 2007, Porsche presented a functioning Cayenne Hybrid and demonstration model of the drivetrain.
Notable modifications to this car include an electric vacuum pump and hydraulic steering pump allowing the car to function even when the engine is deactivated. A 288-volt nickel metal hydride battery is placed under the boot floor, occupying the space normally used for a spare tire.
The 2011 Porsche Cayenne S Hybrid was launched in the U.S. market in November 2010.
The all-wheel drive, five-passenger Cayenne Hybrid is powered by a supercharged 333-hp 3.0-liter V6 engine and a 47-hp electric motor that adds 221 ft-lbs of torque to the drivetrain. Combined, the hybrid system provides 380-hp and 428 ft-lbs of torque through an eight-speed automatic with auto stop-start. A unique feature of the Cayenne Hybrid is the ability to cruise at highway speeds on electric power alone. Standard safety features include Porsche Stability Management (PSM), adaptive brake lights, LED daytime running lights and rear light clusters, seven airbags, including a driver side knee bag, rain sensing wipers and four-wheel anti-lock brakes. Options include such niceties as a conventional moonroof or a panoramic roof system, Bi-Xenon headlamps, power memory seats, a Bose surround sound system, auto-dimming mirrors, a power liftgate and self-leveling air suspension.
The Cayenne Hybrid is unchanged for 2013.
