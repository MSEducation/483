Criticisms

=Noynoying=

Noynoying (pronounced noy-noy-YING) is a protest gimmick in the form of a neologism that Aquino's critics have used to question his work ethic, alleging his inaction on the issues of disaster response and rising oil prices. A play on the term planking and Aquino's nickname, Noynoying involves posing in a lazy manner, such as sitting idly while resting their heads on one hand, and doing nothing.
