Carlo Ancelotti (; born 10 June 1959) is an Italian football manager and former player who currently manages Spanish La Liga side Real Madrid.
Nicknamed Carletto, Ancelotti played as a midfielder and had a successful career with Roma – captaining the team – with whom he won one Scudetto and four Coppa Italia honours and was part of the legendary late 1980s Milan team with which he won two Scudetti and two European Cups in a five-year period. He was capped 26 times and scored one goal for the Italian national team and appeared in the 1990 World Cup.
After spells as manager of Reggiana, Parma and Juventus, Ancelotti was appointed Milan manager in 2001. He won the Scudetto in 2004, the Champions League in 2003 and 2007 and the Coppa Italia in 2003. They were also Serie A and Champions League runner-ups in 2005. He is one of six men to have won the European Cup/Champions League as player and manager. In May 2009, he was appointed Chelsea manager and in his first season led them to a historic Premier League and FA Cup Double. He became only the second non-British manager to win the double, the other being Arsène Wenger. After an uneven 2010–11 Premier League season in which Chelsea failed to retain the title, Ancelotti was dismissed as their manager in May 2011.
On 30 December 2011, Ancelotti signed a contract with ambitious French side Paris Saint-Germain. In his first full season with the club, Ancelotti managed them to the Ligue 1 title and the quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League. On 25 June 2013, Real Madrid announced the signing of Carlo Ancelotti as their new manager on a three-year deal. He was presented to the fans the following day.

Club career

Ancelotti began his career in 1974 with Parma. In 1979, he transferred to Roma, as captain and midfielder, where he won the Italian championship in 1983, the Coppa Italia four times, and helped Roma to reach the European Cup final in 1984. From 1987 until 1992, he played for Milan, and was part of the squad that won consecutive European Cups in 1989 and 1990. During this time, Milan played with one of their finest teams ever assembled in that decade, with Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Mauro Tassotti, and Alessandro Costacurta as defenders; Frank Rijkaard, Ruud Gullit, and Roberto Donadoni as midfielders; and Marco van Basten upfront. His finest moment with Milan was when he received a pass from Ruud Gullit, dribbled around two Real Madrid players, and netted a powerful long-range shot during the Rossoneri's 5–0 thrashing of Real Madrid in the 1989 European Cup semi-finals. He went on to play all 90 minutes in Milan's 4–0 dismantling of Steaua Bucureşti in the final.

International career

Ancelotti made his Italian national team debut and scored his first and only goal on 6 January 1981 in a one-off tournament against the Netherlands, which ended in a 1–1 draw. He was very likely to be capped for the 1982 World Cup campaign, but a dramatic knee injury forced him away for several months. He later went on to appear in the 1990 World Cup, and was part of Italy's World Cup squad in the 1986 World Cup; where he did not get any appearances. Ancelotti made a total of 26 performances, scoring one goal for Italy, a low right footed shot against Holland in the 1980 Mundialito. He announced his retirement from international football in 1991.

Managerial career

Early years

A student at Coverciano, where he penned a research article entitled "Il Futuro del Calcio: Più Dinamicità" (English: The Future of Football: More Dynamism) Ancelotti began his managerial career with Reggiana in 1995, where Reggiana achieved promotion to Serie A. He left the following year, however, for Parma, which included future Italy stars Gianluigi Buffon and Fabio Cannavaro. Parma finished second in the 1996–97 season, which guaranteed them a Champions League place. The following season, Ancelotti guided them to a fifth place, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. In 1999, he was appointed Juventus manager, where he both succeeded and preceded Marcello Lippi, who returned to the club when Ancelotti left. Ancelotti's season began promisingly, winning the Intertoto Cup by beating the red light Rennes 4–2 on aggregate. The following season, however, he went trophyless, finishing runner-up twice in the Serie A. He was brutally sacked by Juventus.  Ancelotti's dismissal was announced by Juventus at halftime in the final league game of the season, even though they were still in with a chance of winning the title.

Milan

Ancelotti was appointed Milan manager on 6 November 2001, after Fatih Terim was sacked due to poor results. He was inheriting another recently trophyless team in Milan, as the Rossoneri had floundered domestically and in Europe since their last Scudetto victory in 1999. In his first full season, Ancelotti soon had Milan back in European competition, leading them to the semi-finals of the 2001–02 UEFA Cup.
The following season, Ancelotti, who was heavily criticized by club owner Silvio Berlusconi due to his defensive tactics, was able to adopt a creative play in Milan while making several roster changes. He made Dida, still maligned for his 2000–01 Champions League howler against Leeds United, his new starting goalkeeper barely a month into the 2002–03 season, while converting budding attacking midfielder Andrea Pirlo to a defensive playmaker and playing him behind Rui Costa. At the same time, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko were dominant and dynamic.
Milan won the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final, beating Juventus 3–2 on penalties at Old Trafford and also won the 2003 Coppa Italia Final.  It was a sweet revenge for him as Juventus  brutally sacked him and to add insult,  Marcello Lippi was re-hired for a second tenure and won back to back Serie A titles.  The following season, Milan took home the Scudetto in 2004. Under Ancelotti's reign, Milan were also back-to-back Serie A runners-up to Juventus in 2004–05 and 2005–06 (both Scudettis were later wiped from the record books of Juventus due to Juventus's involvement in the Calciopoli scandal) and lost the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final to Liverpool, losing 2–3 on penalties after a 3–3 draw in normal time; having been 3–0 up at halftime. Two years later, though, Milan avenged their defeat to Liverpool with a 2–1 win at the Olympic Stadium in Athens in the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final, leading to Ancelotti's second Champions League trophy as Milan coach and his fourth title overall, having also won it twice as a Milan player in 1989 and 1990. He also won the FIFA Club World Cup in 2007, the first manager to do so with a European club. Ancelotti announced his resignation from Milan less than an hour following their 2–0 victory over Fiorentina on 31 May 2009.

Chelsea

On 1 June 2009, Ancelotti succeeded interim manager Guus Hiddink when he was confirmed as the new Chelsea manager after agreeing to a three-year contract, and formally assumed his duties on 1 July."Ancelotti appointed Chelsea boss". BBC Sport. 1 June 2009. His salary at Chelsea was initially reported to be more than £5 million per year. Ancelotti became the club's fourth permanent manager in 21 months, following José Mourinho, Avram Grant, and Luiz Felipe Scolari. He was also the third Italian to manage Chelsea, after Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri.
On 9 August 2009, Ancelotti won his first trophy as Chelsea manager, the Community Shield, beating Manchester United on penalties, following a 2–2 draw. His first Premier League game in charge of the Blues ended in a 2–1 home victory over Hull City on 15 August 2009. Chelsea lost their first match under Ancelotti at the DW Stadium away to Wigan Athletic on 26 September, losing 1–3. They were eliminated from the League Cup on 2 December, reaching the quarter-finals stage, after a penalty shootout defeat to Blackburn Rovers after a 3–3 draw at Ewood Park.
In the Champions League, Ancelotti returned to the San Siro for the first time since his departure from Milan, when his team faced Internazionale, who was coached by, then, ex-Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, at the Round of 16 stage. Ancelotti and Mourinho had a tense relationship from the previous season, as managers of Milan and Inter, respectively."Jose Mourinho reaches crossroads at Inter Milan". BBC Sport. 22 February 2010. Retrieved 14 May 2013. Chelsea was eliminated from the Champions League on 16 March 2010 after a 1–3 aggregate loss to Internazionale, having lost 1–2 away and 0–1 at Stamford Bridge."Inter Milan 2–1 Chelsea". BBC Sport. 24 February 2010. Retrieved 14 May 2013."Chelsea 0–1 Inter Milan (agg 1–3)". BBC Sport. 16 March 2010. Retrieved 14 May 2013.
On 9 May 2010, Ancelotti led Chelsea to the Premier League title, beating Manchester United by one point and setting scoring records. The team finished the campaign with 103 goals, becoming the first team in the Premier League to score more than 100 goals in a season, and the first since Tottenham Hotspur in the 1962–63 season. and only the fifth manager overall in the league's 18 seasons. On 15 May 2010, Ancelotti led Chelsea to victory in the 2009–10 FA Cup, beating Portsmouth 1–0 in the final at Wembley; Chelsea's third victory in the FA Cup in four years, equaling a record set by Arsenal between 2002 and 2005. The Cup win secured Chelsea's first ever domestic double.
The following season, after having lost to Manchester United in the 2010 FA Community Shield in August, Ancelotti led Chelsea to the top of the table on the first weekend of the season thanks to a 6–0 rout of newly promoted West Bromwich Albion. Chelsea followed up this result with another 6–0 win, this time over Wigan, whilst Stoke City were beaten 2–0 in the next match. Chelsea had a good start to the season, winning their first five matches. Chelsea then lost 3–4 against Newcastle United on 23 September 2010 in the League Cup. They then went on to lose against Manchester City in the Premier League 0–1 after a cleverly taken strike by Man City captain Carlos Tevez. Chelsea made a good start in Europe by beating Žilina and Marseille 4–1 and 2–0, respectively, in the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League. Chelsea then defeated fourth-placed Arsenal 2–0 on 3 October 2010, courtesy of a goal from Didier Drogba and a free-kick by defender Alex.
Chelsea's next defeat of the season came against Liverpool at Anfield on 7 November 2010, where they lost 0–2 with both goals coming from Fernando Torres. A week later, Chelsea suffered their second Premier League defeat in three matches with a remarkable 0–3 home defeat to Sunderland. In their following five league games, they lost two and drew three games, culminating in a 1–3 loss to Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. On 5 January 2011, Chelsea suffered a shock 0–1 defeat at struggling Wolverhampton Wanderers, leaving them fifth in the League and in real danger of missing out on a Champions League place for the first time since 2002.
But after this match, however, Chelsea's form began to improve. First with a 7–0 thrashing of Ipswich Town in the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge and then a 2–0 victory over Blackburn Rovers, followed by emphatic away wins against Bolton Wanderers and Sunderland, putting them in fourth position in the league, still 10 points behind leaders Manchester United, though.
On 31 January 2011, Chelsea signed Liverpool striker Fernando Torres for a British record £50 million and Benfica defender David Luiz for £22 million. Chelsea lost 0–1 to Liverpool at Stamford Bridge but beat league leaders Manchester United on 1 March in a 2–1 comeback win that saw David Luiz net his first goal for Chelsea, which was followed by a 3–1 win away to Blackpool. Chelsea were later defeated by Manchester United at home and away (aggregate of 1–3) in the Champions League quarter-finals.
Following their defeat in the Champions League Chelsea made a remarkable comeback in the league, defeating Wigan 1–0 at home, West Bromwich Albion 3–1 away, Birmingham City 3–1, West Ham United 3–0 and Tottenham Hotspur 2–1 at home. Chelsea, who at some point were fifth and 15 points behind leaders Manchester United, vaulted into the second position the league, just three points behind them with three games left of the season.
On 8 May, however, Chelsea lost 1–2 against Manchester United at Old Trafford to stay second in the league, now six points behind the leaders with just two more games to play.
Ancelotti was sacked less than two hours after a 0–1 away defeat against Everton on 22 May, the last match of the season. He reportedly received a severance payment of £6 million from Chelsea.

Paris Saint-Germain

On 30 December 2011, with Paris Saint-Germain at the top of the Ligue 1 with three points down to Montpellier, Ancelotti was appointed as the new manager of the club on the same day as their previous manager, Antoine Kombouaré, was released from his contract. His salary at Paris Saint-Germain was reported to be €6 million per year. Paris Saint-Germain ended up as runners-up in Ligue 1 in Ancelotti's first season in charge three points behind winners Montpellier.
During Ancelotti's first full season at the club, PSG entered the winter break at the top of the Ligue 1 table ahead of Lyon and Marseille on goal difference. They clinched the Ligue 1 title on 12 May 2013 with two matches to spare.

Real Madrid

On 25 June 2013, Ancelotti became the manager of Real Madrid as the replacement for the departing José Mourinho, signing a three-year deal.
He was introduced at a press conference at the Santiago Bernabéu, where it was also announced that Zinedine Zidane and Paul Clement will be his assistant coaches. Shortly following his arrival, Real Madrid confirmed the signing of Isco for a fee of €24 million which was followed by the signing of Asier Illarramendi for €32 million. Argentinean striker Gonzalo Higuain also left the club for €40 million to Napoli. This paved way for a record new signing in Gareth Bale £80 million (91 million euros)
In Ancelotti's first league game in charge on 18 August 2013, Real Madrid won 2–1 at home against Real Betis. 
On 16 April 2014, Ancelotti won his first major trophy as Real Madrid manager after they defeated Barcelona 2–1 in the Copa del Rey final held at the Estadio Mestalla.

Tactics

After a disastrous spell with the diamond formation that worked well for Milan, Ancelotti now usually prefers his sides to play with width, flood the central midfield and often utilises a lone striker, being committed to attacking football.

Personal life

Ancelotti has two children: a daughter, Katia, and a son, Davide, who also played in the Milan youth team and later joined Borgomanero in June 2008. In 2008,  Ancelotti confirmed in an interview that he had broken up with his wife of 25 years.
In May 2009, Ancelotti's autobiography, Preferisco la Coppa ("I Prefer the Cup", with a word-play by Ancelotti on the Italian word "coppa" that stands both for "cup" and a type of cured cold pork meat cut), was published, with all proceeds from sales of the book going to the Fondazione Stefano Borgonovo for the funding of research on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
In his last season with Chelsea, Ancelotti had to travel back to Italy on a regular basis to visit his 87-year-old father who was in poor health with diabetes and other issues. On the issue, he said, "I don't have a problem managing the team for this reason. It's difficult, emotionally, when it's your father... but this is life. I have to do my best to stay close to him, but this is the life.""Ancelotti keeps Chelsea focus despite father's illness". ESPN Soccernet. 18 September 2011. His father died on 29 September 2010, aged 87.
