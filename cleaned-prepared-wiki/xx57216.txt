History

World War II

Bradley has its origins in the 1940 acquisition of 
The airfield was named after 24-year-old Lt. Eugene M. Bradley of Antlers, Oklahoma, assigned to the 64th Pursuit Squadron, who died when his P-40 crashed during a dogfight training drill on August 21, 1941.

Post-war to present

The airfield began civilian use in 1947 as Bradley International Airport. Its first commercial flight was Eastern Air Lines flight 624. International cargo operations at the airport also began that year. Bradley eventually came to replace the older, smaller Hartford-Brainard Airport as Hartford's primary airport.
In 1948 the federal government deeded the Airport to the State of Connecticut for public and commercial use.
In 1950 Bradley International Airport exceeded the 100,000-passenger mark, handling 108,348 annual passengers.
In 1952 the Murphy Terminal was opened. Later dubbed Terminal B, the terminal was the oldest passenger terminal in the US when it closed in 2010.
The April 1957 OAG shows 39 weekday departures: 14 American, 14 Eastern, 9 United and 2 Northeast. Nonstops never reached west of Chicago or south of Washington until Eastern and Northeast began Miami in 1967. Nonstops to Los Angeles and Atlanta started in 1968.
In 1960 Bradley handled 500,238 passengers.
In 1971 the Murphy Terminal was expanded with an International Arrivals wing. This was followed by the installation of instrument landing systems on two runways in 1977.
In 1976 an experimental monorail was completed to link the terminal to a parking lot seven-tenths of a mile away. The "people mover" cost $4 million USD, and was anticipated to cost $250 thousand annually to operate. Due to the high operating cost the monorail was never put in service and was dismantled in 1984 to make room for a new terminal building.

In 1979, a tornado ripped through Windsor Locks, wreaking destruction along the eastern portions of the airport. The New England Air Museum sustained some of the worst damage. It reopened in 1982.
In 1986, new Terminal A and Bradley Sheraton Hotel was completed. The Roncari cargo terminal was also constructed.
In 2001, construction commenced on a new parking garage. When completed, the garage could not immediately be used. The intervening attacks of 9/11 led to regulations requiring parking structures to be set back farther from the tarmac. After opening, for several weeks every vehicle had to be individually inspected, severely reducing its value. Bradley eventually received a waiver for normal operation of the garage from the Department of Homeland Security.
2001 also saw the commencement of the Terminal Improvement Project to expand Terminal A with a new concourse, construct a new International Arrivals Building, and centralize passenger screening. The airport expansion was part of a larger project to enhance the reputation of the Hartford metropolitan area as a destination for business and vacation travel. The new East Concourse, designed by HNTB,HNTB demonstrates engineering expertise at ACEC annual conference opened in September 2002.
In December 2002, a new International Arrivals Building opened to the west of Terminal B. This structure houses the Federal Inspection Station and has one jetway for deboarding aircraft.  All international arrivals except for those from airports with customs preclearance are processed through the IAB.  International departures will be handled from the existing terminal complex.
In July 2007, Northwest Airlines commenced nonstop service from Bradley International Airport to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, the airline normally flew a Boeing 757-200 on the Hartford-Amsterdam route but more than once substituted with a slightly larger 757-300, these 757 variants became the largest scheduled passenger aircraft to fly out of Bradley. It was Bradley's only overseas flight. Northwest Airlines discontinued the flight in 2009."Bradley loses flight to Europe again", Associated Press via WTNH. Retrieved August 6, 2012. Currently, Bradley does not have any scheduled overseas passenger service.
On October 2–3, 2007, the Airbus A380 visited Bradley as part of its world tour, stopping in Hartford to showcase the aircraft to Connecticut workers for Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand, both divisions of United Technologies, which helped build the GP7000 TurboFan engines, which is an option to power the aircraft. Bradley Airport is one of only 68 airports worldwide large enough to accommodate the A380. Despite this statement, no International Airlines or Carriers have yet considered Bradley Airport for possible A380 service.
On October 18, 2007, Bradley International Airport was named one of the top five small airports in the North American Airport Satisfaction Study by J. D. Power and Associates.
On October 7, 2008, Embraer, an aerospace company based in Brazil, selected Bradley as its service center for the Northeastern United States. An $11 million project was begun with support from teams of the Connecticut Department of Transportation and Connecticut's Economic and Community Development. The center is intended to be a full maintenance and repair facility for its line of business jets, and is expected to employ up to 60 aircraft technicians. The facility was temporarily closed ten months after opening due to economic conditions, reopening on February 28, 2011.
On June 21, 2011, the new Boeing 747-8 stopped at Bradley on its introductory world tour, it was the 747-8F cargo variant.
On June 22, 2012, the Connecticut Airport Authority board formally approved the hiring of Kevin A. Dillon as the Executive Director for the Connecticut Airport Authority including Bradley International Airport. Kevin will oversee the expansion of Terminal B and he will work to get new airline service at Bradley.

Passenger, cargo, and military operations

Airlines and destinations

Bradley International Airport's main passenger Terminal A has two concourses: the East Concourse (Gates 1-12) hosts Air Canada, AirTran, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, while the West Concourse (Gates 20–30) hosts American Airlines, United Airlines and US Airways.
Terminal B, the 1952 Murphy Terminal, was closed to passenger use on April 15, 2010. The structure continues to host the Bradley offices of the Connecticut State Police and is used for storage. Plans call for the eventual replacement of the Murphy Terminal with a new 19-gate Terminal B.
All international arrivals (except flights with customs preclearance) are handled at the International Arrivals Building, located to the west of Terminal B. This building was formerly used by Northwest Airlines between 2007 and 2009 when they offered non-stop flights from Bradley to Amsterdam. Today, Delta and Apple Vacations are the sole operators using the IAB.

Top destinations

Cargo operations

In addition to the regular cargo services described above, Bradley is occasionally visited by Antonov An-124 aircraft operated by Volga-Dnepr Airlines, Polet Airlines and Antonov Airlines, transporting heavy cargo, such as Sikorsky helicopters or Pratt & Whitney engines internationally.

Future

Airport construction

On July 3, 2012 the Connecticut Department of Transportation released an Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Evaluation, detailing a proposal to replace the now-vacant Terminal B.
The replacement proposal calls for:
The proposal calls for a three-phase construction program:
Actual completion dates could vary due to funding and demand.

Ground transportation

Rail

The nearby Windsor Locks and Windsor train stations are both served by Amtrak. The New Haven–Hartford–Springfield commuter rail line, which is expected to begin service in 2016, will increase the speed, frequency and reliability of trains along the corridor.  Presently, 12 trains serve Windsor Locks station daily.  This is expected to increase to 32 in 2016 and 70 by 2020.
The plans call for every train at Windsor Locks Station to be met by an airport shuttle bus which would provide a direct connection from the station to the terminal.  
Plans have been discussed to construct a fixed rail link to serve the airport.

Bus

Connecticut Transit route 34 provides local service connecting Bradley with Windsor and Hartford. Route 30 (the "Bradley Flyer") provides express service to downtown Hartford.

Environment

The Connecticut Air National Guard 103d Airlift Wing leases  in the southwest corner of the airport for their Bradley ANG Base. The base is a designated Superfund site.
Bradley has also been identified as one of the last remaining tracts of grassland in Connecticut suitable for a few endangered species of birds, including the Upland Sandpiper, the Horned Lark, and the Grasshopper Sparrow.
