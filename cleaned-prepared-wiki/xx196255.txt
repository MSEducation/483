Athletic director career

Mississippi State
Byrne is the former athletics director for Mississippi State University.  On June 7, 2008, Byrne hired John Cohen as head baseball coach to replace Ron Polk, who retired the preceding March.

On December 10, 2008, Byrne hired Dan Mullen as head football coach to replace Sylvester Croom who resigned after five years and a 21–38 record at Mississippi State.com. Retrieved November 29, 2008.  Byrne received many plaudits for hiring Mullen, who is considered a rising star in coaching.com. March 22, 2010.  Among Mullen's accomplishments, he coached NFL first round draft pick Alex Smith at University of Utah, recruited 2007 Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow to University of Florida where he also won two National Championships.
On March 22, 2010, Greg Byrne was hired at the University of Arizona (replacing longtime Arizona AD Jim Livengood, who accepted the AD position at UNLV some months prior) and officially started in his new position on May 1, 2010. 
Arizona
Byrne took over a long-term $378 million sports expansion project at Arizona, announced the previous fall, that would include an expansion of the north end zone stands at Arizona Stadium. The expansion would include a four-story building that would house locker rooms and football offices, among other things.
Also under Byrne, another, more immediate and major change to the Wildcat football program occurred: eight-year head coach Mike Stoops was relieved of his duties on Oct 10, 2011 after the Wildcats opened the season with a 1-5 record. Co-defensive coordinator Tim Kish was named as interim head coach.Mike Stoops is out: Why and what's next?
