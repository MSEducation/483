History of Tourism

The origins of early traditions of visits to picturesque sites are unclear, but early sight-seeing excursions was Matsuo Basho's 1689 trip to the then "far north" of Japan, which occurred not long after Hayashi Razan categorized the Three Views of Japan in 1643.  During the feudal era of Japan, from around 1600 to the Meiji Restoration in 1867, travel was regulated within the country through the use of shukuba or post stations, towns in which travelers had to present appropriate documentation.  Despite these restrictions, porter stations and horse stables, as well as places for lodging and food were available on well-traveled routes.  During this time, Japan was a closed country to foreigners, so no foreign tourism existed in Japan. Following the Meiji Restoration and the building of a national railroad network across Japan, tourism became more of an affordable prospect for domestic citizens and visitors from foreign countries could enter Japan legally.  As early as 1887, government officials recognized the need for an organized system of attracting foreign tourists; the

Tourism Today

Domestic tourism remains a vital part of the Japanese economy and Japanese culture.  School children in many middle schools see the highlight of their years as a visit to Tokyo Disneyland or perhaps Tokyo Tower and many  high school students often visit Okinawa or Hokkaido. The extensive rail network together with domestic flights sometimes in planes with modifications to favor the relatively short distances involved in intra-Japan travel allows efficient and speedy transport.
In inbound tourism, Japan was ranked 28th in the world in 2007.
In 2009, the Yomiuri Shimbun published a modern list of famous sights under the name Heisei Hyakkei (the Hundred Views of the Heisei period).
Neighbouring South Korea is Japan's most important source of foreign tourists. In 2010, the 2.4 million arrivals made up 27% of the tourists visiting Japan.
Chinese travellers are the highest spenders in Japan by country, spending an estimated 196.4 billion yen (US$2.4 billion) in 2011, or almost a quarter of total expenditure by foreign visitors, according to data from the Japan Tourism Agency.

Tourism after the Fukushima disaster

After the triple melt-down of the nuclear reactors in Fukushima, the number of foreign visitors declined for months in a row. To boost tourism the Japanese Tourism Agency announced in October 2011 a plan to give 10,000 round-trip air tickets to Japan away in order to encourage visitors to come to Japan. In 2012 free tickets would be offered on condition that the winners would write online about their experiences in Japan. They also would need to answer some questions, about how they felt while visiting Japan after the earthquake, and how the interest in tourism in Japan could be renewed. In September 2011 some 539,000 foreign people visited Japan, this was 25 percent down compared with the same month in 2010. This decline was largely attributed to the Fukushima nuclear accident, but also the stronger yen made a visit to Japan more expensive. About 15 million dollars would be spent on this program.NHK-world (21 October 2011) Japan to give away air tickets to 10,000 visitorsJAIF (22 October 2011)Earthquake report 242: Japan to give away air tickets to 10,000 visitors
On December 26, 2011, The Japan Tourism Agency reported on their site that the "Fly to Japan! Project", which would have given out 10,000 round-trip tickets to Japan, was not approved by the government for fiscal year 2012.
