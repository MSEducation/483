History

The Early Years

The season of 1963-1964 considered as the best season of Maccabi Jaffa history. In this season Maccabi Jaffa fought the championship against Hapoel Ramat Gan. In the games between the teams, Jaffa had won 3-1 in Ramat Gan, and 1-0 in Jaffa, but that wasn't enough. Ramat-Gan won the Championship, only 1 point above Maccabi Jaffa. In that season, Maccabi Jaffa striker Israel Ashkenazi was Israel's top scorer with 21 goals.
In the late 1960s, Jaffa failed to show the same quality as in their top years, and in the season of 1969-1970 Maccabi Jaffa finished in the 15th position, and was relegated to the second league, after 14 years in the top division

The 1970s

The rest of the 1970s, Jaffa was a mediocre team in the Israeli first division. The only season worth mentioning is 1976-1977. in this year, Jaffa was once again close to be the champions. Jaffa finished in the second place, after Maccabi Tel Aviv, that's after Jaffa won Tel-Aviv in both games that season.

The 1980s
