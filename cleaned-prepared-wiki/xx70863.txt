The Burmese language (. MLCTS: myanma bhasa) is the official language of Burma. Burmese is the native language of the Bamar and related sub-ethnic groups of the Bamar, as well as that of some ethnic minorities in Burma like the Mon.
Burmese is spoken by 32 million as a first language and as a second language by 10 million, particularly ethnic minorities in Burma and those in neighboring countries. (Although the Constitution of Burma officially recognizes the English name of the language as the Myanmar language,Constitution of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (2008), Chapter XV, Provision 450 most English speakers continue to refer to the language as Burmese.)
Burmese is a tonal, pitch-register, and syllable-timed language, largely monosyllabic and analytic language, with a subject–object–verb word order. It is a member of the Tibeto-Burman language family, which is a subfamily of the Sino-Tibetan family of languages. The language uses the Burmese script, derived from the Old Mon script and ultimately from the Brāhmī script.

Classification

Burmese is a Sino-Tibetan language belonging to the Southern Burmish branch of the Tibeto-Burman languages. Burmese is the most widely spoken of the Tibeto-Burman languages and among the Sino-Tibetan languages, the second most widely spoken, after the Sinitic languages.

Dialects

The majority of Burmese speakers, who live throughout the Irrawaddy River valley, use a number of largely uniform dialects, while a minority speak non-standard dialects found in the  peripheral areas of the country. These dialects include:
Arakanese (Rakhine) in Rakhine State and Marma in Bangladesh are also sometimes considered dialects of Burmese, sometimes as a separate language.
Despite vocabulary and pronunciation differences, there is mutual intelligibility among Burmese dialects, as for the most part, they share the same four tones, consonant clusters and the writing system. However, several dialects substantially differ in Burmese with respect to vocabulary, lexical particles, and rhymes.

=Irrawaddy River valley=

The standard dialect of Burmese (the Mandalay-Yangon dialect continuum) comes from the Irrawaddy River valley. Regional differences between speakers from Upper Burma (e.g., Mandalay dialect), called anya tha , which is used in Upper Burma.
The standard dialect is represented by the Yangon dialect, because of the city's media influence and economic clout. In the past, the Mandalay dialect represented standard Burmese. The most noticeable feature of the Mandalay dialect is its use of the first person pronoun  is used by females. Moreover, with regard to kinship terminology, Upper Burmese speakers differentiate the maternal and paternal sides of a family whereas Lower Burmese speakers do not.
Spoken Burmese is remarkably uniform among Burmese speakers, In the British colonial era, British incentives, particularly geared toward rice production, as well as political instability in Upper Burma accelerated this migration.

=Outside the Irrawaddy basin=

More distinctive non-standard dialects emerge as one moves farther away from the Irrawaddy River valley toward peripheral areas of the country. These dialects include Yaw, Palaw, Merguese (Myeik), Tavoyan (Dawei), Intha, Danu, Arakanese (Rakhine) and Marma. Despite substantial vocabulary and pronunciation differences, there is mutual intelligibility among most Burmese dialects.
The most pronounced feature of the Arakanese (Rakhine) is its retention of the  in Arakanese.
Dialects in Tanintharyi Region, including Palaw, Merguese (Myeik), Tavoyan (Dawei), are especially conservative in comparison to Standard Burmese. The Dawei and Intha dialects have preserved the 

Registers

Burmese is a diglossic language with two distinguishable registers (or diglossic varieties), used in various settings:
The literary form of Burmese retains archaic and conservative grammatical structures and modifiers (including particles, markers and pronouns) no longer used in the colloquial form. Examples of this phenomenon include the following lexical items:
In the mid-1960s, some Burmese writers, who asserted that the vernacular, spoken form ought to be used, spearheaded efforts to abandon the literary form, which was historically the preferred form of written Burmese, as "the spoken style lacks gravity, authority, dignity."
The following sample sentence reveals that differences between literary and spoken Burmese mostly occur in grammatical particles:
Spoken Burmese has various politeness levels and honorifics that take the speaker's status and age in relation to the audience into account. The particle  The following are examples of varying vocabulary used for Buddhist clergy and for laity :

Vocabulary

Burmese vocabulary is primarily monosyllabic and of Tibeto-Burman stock. Nonetheless, many words, especially loanwords from Indo-European languages like English, are polysyllabic, and others, from Mon, a Mon-Khmer language, are disyllabic.
Historically, Pali, the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism, has been of profound influence to the Burmese language, especially in enriching the Burmese vocabulary. Burmese has readily adopted words of Pali origin because of phonotactic similarities between two languages, alongside the fact that the Burmese script can reproduce Pali spellings with complete accuracy.
Burmese loanwords from Pali primarily take four forms:
Burmese has also adapted a great deal of words from the Mon language, traditionally spoken by the Mon people, who until recently, formed the majority in Lower Burma. Most Mon loanwords are so well assimilated that they are not distinguished as loanwords because they were more often borrowed from speech rather than writing, since Burmese and Mon were used interchangeably for several centuries in pre-colonial Burma.
English, as a natural consequence of British colonization of Burma, has been a major source of vocabulary, especially with regard to technology, measurements and modern institutions. English loanwords tend to take one of three forms:
To a lesser extent, Burmese has also imported words from Sanskrit (religion), Hindi (food, administration, and shipping), and Chinese (games and food). Burmese has also imported a handful of words from other European languages such as Portuguese.
Here is a sample of loan words found in Burmese:
Since the end of British rule, the Burmese government has attempted to limit usage of Western loans (especially from English) by coining new words (neologisms). For instance, for the word "television," Burmese publications are mandated to use the term 
Some words in Burmese may have many synonyms, each having certain usages, such as formal, literary, colloquial, and poetic. One example is the word "moon", which can be 

Phonology

The transcriptions in this section use the International Phonetic Alphabet.

Consonants

The consonants of Burmese are as follows:
Burmese exhibits two distinct types of voicing sandhi, which occurs in the consonant phones:

In the first type, the initial consonant of the second syllable becomes voiced:
In the second type, the initial consonants of both syllables become voiced:
In some compound works, the phoneme  sound: 
The phonemes  in compound words:
The placeless nasal .
In many Burmese verbs, pre-aspiration and post-aspiration distinguishes the causative and non-causative forms of verbs, whereby the aspirated initial consonant indicates active voice or a transitive verb, while an unaspirated initial consonant indicates passive voice or an intransitive verb:

Vowels

The vowels of Burmese are:
The monophthongs  only occurs in a minor syllable, and is the only vowel that is permitted in a minor syllable (see below).
The close vowels .

Tones

Burmese is a tonal language, which means phonemic contrasts can be made on the basis of the tone of a vowel. In Burmese, these contrasts involve not only pitch, but also phonation, intensity (loudness), duration, and vowel quality. However, some linguists consider Burmese a pitch-register language like Shanghainese.
There are four contrastive tones in Burmese. In the following table, the tones are shown marked on the vowel  as an example.
For example, the following words are distinguished from each other only on the basis of tone:
In syllables ending with , the checked tone is excluded:
In spoken Burmese, some linguists classify two real tones (there are four nominal tones transcribed in written Burmese), "high" (applied to words that terminate with a stop or check, high-rising pitch) and "ordinary" (unchecked and non-glottal words, with falling or lower pitch), with those tones encompassing a variety of pitches.

Syllable structure

The syllable structure of Burmese is C(G)V((V)C), which is to say the onset consists of a consonant optionally followed by a glide, and the rime consists of a monophthong alone, a monophthong with a consonant, or a diphthong with a consonant. The only consonants that can stand in the coda are . Some representative words are:
A minor syllable has some restrictions:
Some examples of words containing minor syllables:

Alphabet

The Burmese alphabet consists of 33 letters and 12 vowels, and is written from left to right. It requires no spaces between words, although modern writing usually contains spaces after each clause to enhance readability. Characterized by its circular letters and diacritics, the script is an abugida, with all letters having an inherent vowel 
The development of the script followed that of the language, which is generally divided into Old Burmese, Middle Burmese and modern Burmese. Old Burmese dates from the 11th to the 16th century (Pagan and Ava dynasties); Middle Burmese from the 16th to the 18th century (Toungoo to early Konbaung dynasties); modern Burmese from the mid-18th century to the present. Orthographic changes followed shifts in phonology (such as the merging of the . Similar mergers are seen in other Sino-Tibetan languages like Shanghainese, and to a lesser extent, Cantonese.)
Written Burmese dates to the early Pagan period. The script was developed from either the Mon script in 1058

Grammar

The basic word order of the Burmese language is subject-object-verb. Pronouns in Burmese vary according to the gender and status of the audience. Burmese is monosyllabic (i.e., every word is a root to which a particle but not another word may be prefixed). is itself unchanged when modified.

Adjectives

Burmese does not have adjectives per se. Rather, it has verbs that carry the meaning "to be X", where X is an English adjective. These verbs can modify a noun by means of the grammatical particle , which is suffixed as follows:
Adjectives may also form a compound with the noun (e.g.  "person" + "be beautiful").
Comparatives are usually ordered: X + .
Numerals follow the nouns they modify. Moreover, numerals follow several pronunciation rules that involve tone changes (low tone → creaky tone) and voicing shifts depending on the pronunciation of surrounding words. A more thorough explanation is found on Burmese numerals.

Verbs

The roots of Burmese verbs are almost always suffixed with at least one particle which conveys such information as tense, intention, politeness, mood, etc. Many of these particles also have formal/literary and colloquial equivalents. In fact, the only time in which no particle is attached to a verb is in imperative commands. However, Burmese verbs are not conjugated in the same way as most European languages; the root of the Burmese verb always remains unchanged and does not have to agree with the subject in person, number or gender.
The most commonly used verb particles and their usage are shown below with an example verb root  is imperative.
The suffix  can be viewed as a particle marking the present tense and/or a factual statement:
The suffix  in this case denotes a factual statement rather than the present tense:
The particle  is used to denote an action in progression. It is equivalent to the English '-ing'"
This particle  is used as follows:
The particle  is used to indicate the future tense or an action which is yet to be performed:
The particle . Therefore it could be termed as the "immediate future tense particle".
When  is used alone, however, it is imperative:
Verbs are negated by the particle .
The verb suffix particle  indicates a command:
The verb suffix particle  indicates a statement:

Nouns

Nouns in Burmese are pluralized by suffixing the particle , which indicates a group of persons or things, is also suffixed to the modified noun. An example is below:
Plural suffixes are not used when the noun is quantified with a number.
|+"five children"
|-
| 
|-
| hka.le: || nga: || yauk
|-
| 
|-
| child || five || classifier
|-
|}
Although Burmese does not have grammatical gender (e.g. masculine or feminine nouns), a distinction is made between the sexes, especially in animals and plants, by means of suffix particles. Nouns are masculinized with the following particles: . Examples of usage are below:

=Numerical classifiers=

Like its neighboring languages such as Thai, Bengali, and Chinese, Burmese uses numerical classifiers (also called measure words) when nouns are counted or quantified. This approximately equates to English expressions such as "two slices of bread" or "a cup of coffee". Classifiers are required when counting nouns, so  needs to suffix the numeral.
The standard word order of quantified words is: quantified noun + numeral adjective + classifier, except in round numbers (numbers that end in zero), in which the word order is flipped, where the quantified noun precedes the classifier: quantified noun + classifier + numeral adjective. The only exception to this rule is the number 10, which follows the standard word order.
Measurements of time, such as "hour,"  do not require classifiers.
Below are some of the most commonly used classifiers in Burmese.

Particles

The Burmese language makes prominent usage of particles (called  ("work" + particle indicating imperative mood + particle indicating politeness) does. Particles may be combined in some cases, especially those modifying verbs.
Some particles modify the word's part of speech. Among the most prominent of these is the particle .

Pronouns

Subject pronouns begin sentences, though the subject is generally omitted in the imperative forms and in conversation. Grammatically speaking, subject marker particles  in formal) attached immediately after the pronoun. Proper nouns are often substituted for pronouns. One's status in relation to the audience determines the pronouns used, with certain pronouns used for different audiences.
Polite pronouns are used to address elders, teachers and strangers, through the use of feudal-era third person pronouns in lieu of first and second person pronouns. In such situations, one refers to oneself in third person:  So ingrained are these terms in the daily polite speech that people use them as the first and second person pronouns without giving a second thought to the root meaning of these pronouns.
When speaking to a person of the same status or of younger age,  "daughter".
The basic pronouns are:
Other pronouns are reserved for speaking with Buddhist monks. When speaking to a monk, pronouns like , "donor" are used. When speaking to a monk, the following pronouns are used:
In colloquial Burmese, possessive pronouns are contracted when the root pronoun itself is low toned. This does not occur in literary Burmese, which uses ၏ . Examples include the following:
The contraction also occurs in some low toned nouns, making them possessive nouns (e.g. , "mother's" and "Burma's" respectively).

=Family terms=

Minor pronunciation differences do exist within regions of Irrawaddy valley. For example, the pronunciation , which is preferred in Upper Burma. However, the most obvious difference between Upper Burmese and Lower Burmese is that Upper Burmese speech still differentiates maternal and paternal sides of a family:
1 The youngest (paternal or maternal) aunt may be called .
In a testament to the power of media, the Yangon-based speech is gaining currency even in Upper Burma. Upper Burmese-specific usage, while historically and technically accurate, is increasingly viewed as countrified speech, or at best regional speech. In fact, some usages are already considered strictly regional Upper Burmese speech, and are likely dying out. For example:
In general, the male-centric names of old Burmese for familial terms have been replaced in standard Burmese with formerly female-centric terms, which are now used by both sexes. One holdover is the use of  (brother and sister).

Reduplication

Reduplication is prevalent in Burmese and is used to intensify or weaken adjectives' meanings. For example,  "frequently", which become adverbs when reduplicated.
Some nouns are also reduplicated to indicate plurality. For instance,  means "multiple kinds."
A few measure words can also be reduplicated to indicate "one or the other":

Romanization and transcription

There is no official romanization system for Burmese. There have been attempts to make one, but none have been successful. Replicating Burmese sounds in the Latin script is complicated. There is a Pāli-based transcription system in existence, MLC Transcription System, which was devised by the Myanmar Language Commission (MLC). However, it only transcribes sounds in formal Burmese and is based on the orthography rather than the phonology.
Several colloquial transcription systems have been proposed, but none is overwhelmingly preferred over others.
Transcription of Burmese is not standardized, as seen in the varying English transcriptions of Burmese names. For instance, a Burmese personal name like  may be romanized as Khaing, Khine, or Khain.

Computer fonts and standard keyboard layout

The Burmese script can be entered from the standard QWERTY keyboard. The most popular Burmese font, Zawgyi, is not Unicode-compliant though a number of Unicode-compliant fonts are available. The national standard keyboard layout for Unicode-compliant font shown here. It is known as the Myanmar3 layout as it was published along with the Myanmar3 Unicode font. The layout, developed by the Myanmar NLP Research Center, has a smart input system to cover the complex structures of Burmese and related scripts.
