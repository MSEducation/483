Zachariah "Zach" Selwyn (born on April 23, 1975), also known as simply Zachariah, is an American singer-songwriter, actor, host and writer best known for his appearances on the series Dream Job, Attack of the Show! Catch It Keep It and "Punkin Chunkin".
Following the release of his country-rock CD "Ghost Signs" in 2003, Selwyn beat out a potential crowd of over 20,000 and appeared on the first season of the ESPN's reality show Dream Job. Selwyn debuted on the show in its second episode on February 29, 2004.  Selwyn also hosted Fanarchy, a weekly sports debate series that aired on Versus.

Early career and Dream Job

While he was reading a SportsCenter "Top Ten" highlights segment on the show, all eyes were on Selwyn's long hair, beard and his 70s Outlaw country western leisure suit. ESPN Vice-President of Talent, Al Jaffe, one of the show's judges, told him he was not credible because of his looks. Selwyn cleaned up his look (meaning he cut his beard into a goatee) in time for episode three. He went on to finish in third place on the show. Aaron Levine finished second to the eventual winner, Mike Hall. Tony Kornheiser later apologized for not picking Selwyn on his popular show "Pardon the Interruption" and admitted he had made a mistake. Zach appeared on "Pardon the Interruption" in June 2004 and read viewer mail with Kornheiser.
Selwyn appeared as the backwoods country-rap singing gas station attendant Randall Keith Randall in the film Dead and Breakfast released in early 2005.
Selwyn recorded three songs with pop singer and The Black Eyed Peas member Fergie from 2001 â€“ 2002. Two of those songs, "Will The Ink Fade" and "No Place at All (Baby I'm a Drifter)" appear on Zachariah's first cd "Ghost Signs." The other song, "Other Side" is on the "C.I.L.F." ep from 2006.

Post-Dream Job career
