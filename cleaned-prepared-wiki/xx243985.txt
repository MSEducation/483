The Basilica of Saint John the Evangelist is a Catholic parish church and minor basilica in Stamford, Connecticut, USA. It was founded in the 1850s and a new church was built in 1868 to meet the increasing needs of the congregation. It serves a multi-lingual congregation, including descendants of the original congregation.

History

In 1849, Stamford's small Catholic community purchased land, and, on July 4, broke ground for the original church of Saint John the Evangelist on Meadow Street. The small, one-story wooden framed church structure measured 60 feet by 40 feet, with some rudimentary gothic decorations, a small steeple and a bell. It was dedicated in 1851. By 1854, Saint John's became an independent mission, with Father Edward J. Cooney, its first pastor.Thomas S. Duggan. (1930). The Catholic Church in Connecticut.

To meet the growing Catholic population, a larger church was built in 1868. A few years later, the adjacent property and private home was purchased to serve as a rectory, and another parcel was purchased to be used in the future for the new parish school and convent.

ISBN 1178501035) James Murphy of Providence, Rhode Island was the architect of the new stone church, having designed and constructed fifty-six of the Catholic churches throughout New England. The interior was designed by John Ennis, a Dublin theater designer. The Saint John the Evangelist church was completed and consecrated on May 30, 1886 by Bishop Lawrence Stephen McMahon. It was the largest in the state at the time. It is known as "The Mother Church of Stamford."The New York Times, May 31, 1886Just, Olivia. (December 17, 2010).

Two new convents were constructed at the site of the new church on Atlantic Street.

Diverse community

Saint John's Parish had been founded by impoverished Irish Catholic immigrants and over time served a congregation of widening backgrounds. Since 1890 apostolates have begun for the Italian immigrants (1890), Polish and Slovak immigrants (1900), Hispanic community, and Haitian Catholics (1972). (1987).

Urban development

In response to Saint John's support of the city's urban development program through donations of seed money and land, the city named the three affordable housing apartments, Saint John's Towers after the parish. The Bishop of Bridgeport and the Pastor of Saint John's Church are ex-officio members of the board of directors of the Saint John's Urban Development Corporation, the legal entity that oversees the housing complex.The Stamford Advocate, November 27, 1970

Minor Basilica

On July 16, 2009, His Holiness, Pope Benedict XVI, raised Saint John's Parish to the dignity and title of Minor Basilica based upon its sanctuary size, historical importance, art and recognition within the Diocses. At that time, there were 65 Minor Basilicas in the United States and 1,561 in the world.The Stamford Times, October 25, 2009 Regarding the state of the sanctuary and its artwork:
 
 The gothic High Altar of white Carrera marble and golden Mexican onyx dates to the church's opening in 1886. The altar crucifix above the tabernacle is from the original 1851 church. The three stained-glass windows above the sanctuary, depicting the Incarnation, the Crucifixion, and the Resurrection, are Dutch in origin and the oldest in the church, dating to 1886."
