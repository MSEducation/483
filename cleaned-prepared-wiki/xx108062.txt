History

Historic brewing company

Mitchells & Butlers Brewery was formed by the merger of two breweries in 1898. Their most famous beer was Brew XI (using Roman numerals, and so pronounced Brew Eleven), advertised with the slogan "for the men of the Midlands". It is now brewed under licence for Coors by Brains of Cardiff.

Bass

Bass plc, based in Birmingham, transformed into separate brewing and retail divisions following the Beer Orders of 1989 and then proceeded to build a large hotel portfolio alongside its bingo, betting and electronic leisure interests. In the late 1990s the latter interests were sold. On 21 July 1995, Bass bought 78 Harvester restaurants for £165 million from the Forte Group.

Six Continents

In 2000, Bass also divested its brewing arm and rebranded itself Six Continents before another split in April 2003 into two separate companies, with the hotel assets forming InterContinental Hotels Group and the Mitchells & Butlers name brought back for the pubs and restaurants company. In March 2003, Six Continents fought off a proposed £5.5 billion takeover by Hugh Osmond (Punch Taverns).

M & B

M & B was formed on 15 April 2003. In April 2006, it was approached by a consortium led by Robert Tchenguiz in a £2.7 billion takeover, which was dropped in May 2006.
In February 2008 Punch Taverns offered to merge with M & B,

In July 2006, it purchased 239 pub restaurants (Beefeater and Brewers Fayre without a Premier Inn) from Whitbread for £497 million to strengthen its food business ahead of the introduction of a smoking ban in enclosed public spaces in England in 2007.
In July 2008 it bought 44 restaurants from Whitbread - its former Brewers Fayre and Beefeater outlets that were not next to a Premier Inn.
In September 2010 it bought the 22 restaurants of the (upmarket) Ha Ha! chain from the Bay Restaurant Group for £19.5 million. Twelve were turned into All Bar One and six into Browns Restaurants. The Ha Ha! brand disappeared.

Sale of pubs

In October 2006 it sold off 102 of its smaller community pubs to  Chorley-based Trust Inns 
On 15 July 2010, it was announced Travelodge had acquired the leases of 52 Innkeeper's Lodge Hotels around Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool, Northampton, Milton Keynes and Leeds areas from Mitchells & Butlers.
In November 2010 it sold 333 pubs to the Stonegate Pub Company (of London and owned by TDR Capital) for £373 million. These pubs were the drinks-focussed (lower price) outlets such as Flares and Scream Pubs, which mostly had late-night licences. Also sold were High Street Bars & Venues, Town Pubs and Community Pubs. The deal was monitored and completed by then Managing Director Roger Moxham, who spent 2 weeks meeting with lawyers and representatives to make one of the biggest deals Mitchells and Butlers ever completed.
