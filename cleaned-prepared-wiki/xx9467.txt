After Kiev, the Red Army no longer outnumbered the Germans and there were no more directly available trained reserves. To defend Moscow, Stalin could field 800,000 men in 83 divisions, but no more than 25 divisions were fully effective. Operation Typhoon, the drive to Moscow, began on 2 October. In front of Army Group Center was a series of elaborate defense lines, the first centered on Vyazma and the second on Mozhaysk.
The first blow took the Soviets completely by surprise as the 2nd Panzer Army, returning from the south, took Oryol which was  south of the Soviet first main defense line. Three days later, the Panzers pushed on to Bryansk while 2nd Army attacked from the west. The Soviet 3rd and 13th Armies were now encircled. To the north, the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies attacked Vyazma, trapping the 19th, 20th, 24th and 32nd Armies. Moscow's first line of defense had been shattered. The pocket eventually yielded 673,000 Soviet prisoners, bringing the tally since the start of the invasion to three million. The Soviets had only 90,000 men and 150 tanks left for the defense of Moscow.
The Soviets had already survived beyond the few weeks that most experts expected after the Germans invaded; Walter Duranty was perhaps the only observer to predict that the USSR could survive for much longer. a day. The supply situation rapidly deteriorated. On 31 October, the German Army High Command ordered a halt to Operation Typhoon while the armies were reorganized. The pause gave the Soviets, who were in a far better supply situation, time to consolidate their positions and organize formations of newly activated reservists. In little over a month the Soviets organized eleven new armies which included 30 divisions of Siberian troops. These had been freed from the Soviet far east as Soviet intelligence had assured Stalin there was no longer a threat from the Japanese. With the Siberian forces came over 1,000 tanks and 1,000 aircraft.
The Germans were nearing exhaustion, while they also began to recall Napoleon's invasion of Russia. General Günther Blumentritt noted in his diary:
 They remembered what happened to Napoleon's Army. Most of them began to re-read Caulaincourt's grim account of 1812. That had a weighty influence at this critical time in 1941. I can still see Von Kluge trudging through the mud from his sleeping quarters to his office and standing before the map with Caulaincourt's book in his hand.A. Clark 1995, p. 165. 
On 15 November, with the ground hardening due to the cold weather, the Germans once again began the attack on Moscow. Although the troops themselves were now able to advance again, there had been no delay allowed to improve the supply situation. Facing the Germans were the 5th, 16th, 30th, 43rd, 49th, and 50th Soviet armies. The Germans intended to let 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies cross the Moscow Canal and envelop Moscow from the northeast. 2nd Panzer Army would attack Tula and then close in on Moscow from the south. As the Soviets reacted to the flanks, 4th Army would attack the center. In two weeks of desperate fighting, lacking sufficient fuel and ammunition, the Germans slowly crept towards Moscow. However, in the south, 2nd Panzer Army was being blocked. On 22 November, Soviet Siberian units augmented with the 49th and 50th Soviet Armies attacked the 2nd Panzer Army and inflicted a shocking defeat on the Germans. However, 4th Panzer Army pushed the Soviet 16th Army back and succeeded in crossing the Moscow canal and began the encirclement.
On 2 December, part of the 258th Infantry Division advanced to within . By December 1941, the invasion had cost the German Army over 210,000 killed and missing and 620,000 wounded in 1941, a third of whom became casualties after 1 October and an unknown number of Axis casualties such as Hungarians, Romanians, and Waffen SS troops as well as co-belligerent Finns.
This phase of the operation was cut short because of the Russian winter and resulted in the heaviest losses of the war on the German side.

Events

Looking back near the end of the war, as Germany's inevitable and impending defeat loomed ever closer, Hitler attributed great blame to Mussolini's Greek fiasco as the cause of his own subsequent catastrophe. During the campaign, Hitler ordered the main thrust toward Moscow to be diverted southward to help the Southern Army Group capture Ukraine. This move delayed the assault on the Soviet capital, though it also helped secure Army Group Center's southern flank. By the time they turned to Moscow, the Red Army's fierce resistance, the mud following the autumn rains and, eventually, snow, brought their advance to a halt.
In addition, resistance by the Soviets, who proclaimed a Great Patriotic War in defense of the motherland, was much more fierce than the German command had expected. The border fortress of Brest, Belarus illustrates that tenacity: attacked on the very first day of the German invasion, the fortress was expected to fall within hours, but held out over a week. (Soviet propaganda later asserted it held out for six weeks). See also Charles Messenger, The Chronological Atlas of World War Two (New York: Macmillan Publishing 1989), p. 63. German logistics also became a major problem, as supply lines grew very long and vulnerable to partisan attacks in the rear. The Soviets also carried out a scorched earth policy on some of the land they were forced to abandon in order to deny the Germans food, fuel and buildings.
Despite the setbacks, the German advance continued, often destroying or surrounding whole armies of Soviet troops and forcing them to surrender. The battle for Kiev was especially brutal. On 19 September, Army Group South seized control of Kiev, and took 665,000 prisoners. Kiev was later awarded the title Hero City for its defense.
Army Group North, which was to conquer the Baltic countries and eventually Leningrad, reached the southern outskirts of Leningrad by August 1941. There, fierce Soviet resistance stopped it. Since capturing the city seemed too costly, German command decided to starve the city to death by blockade, starting the Siege of Leningrad. The city held out, despite several attempts by the Germans to break through its defenses, unrelenting air and artillery attacks, and severe shortages of food and fuel, until the Germans were driven back from the city's approaches in early 1944. The siege resulted in the deaths of some one million of the city's inhabitants. Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin. Basic Books. p.173. ISBN 0-465-00239-0 Leningrad was the first Soviet city to receive the title of 'Hero City'.
In addition to the main attacks of Barbarossa, German forces occupied the Finnish district of Petsamo in order to secure its important nickel mines. They also launched a series of attacks against Murmansk beginning on 28 June 1941, known as Operation Silberfuchs.

Reasons for initial Soviet defeats

The Red Army and air force were so badly defeated in 1941 mainly because they were ill-prepared for the Axis surprise attack. By 1941 the Germans were the most experienced and best-trained troops in the world for the rapid, blitzkrieg-style warfare that encompassed the Eastern Front during the second half of 1941.
The Axis had a doctrine of mobility, annihilation, excellent communications and  confidence caused by repeated low-cost victories. The Soviet armed forces, by contrast, lacked leadership, training and readiness. Of the five marshals appointed in 1935, only two emerged from Stalin's purge with their lives; 50 out of the 57 corps commanders were killed, 154 out of the 186 divisional commanders and 401 out of 456 colonels; and many other officers were dismissed. The commissars held a position equal to that of the commander but with the authority to countermand his orders.Clark, Lloyd, Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943, 2012, page 58
Nonetheless, the impact of the purges must be seen in context of the military strength of the armed forces in 1937, which was far from actualizing the goals set by the military reforms that began in the early 1930s. By 1941 about 80% of the officers dismissed during the purge had been reinstated. Also, between January 1939 and May 1941, 161 new divisions were activated. Therefore, although about 75% of all the officers had been in their position for less than one year by 1941, that was because of the rapid increase in creation of military units, and not just because of the purge. Hence, it was the combined effect of the purge and the rapid expansion of the army that led to its dilution.
In the interwar years following the end of World War I, much of the effort of the Red Army was put towards the development of offensive forces, concepts, doctrines, and techniques. Soviet brainpower and resources focused on the creation of elements critical to achieving strategic offensive success through the conduct of deep operations and deep battle. The Red Army's fixation on offensive combat meant little attention was given to defensive combat. For instance, the 1936 Field Regulations devoted only about 20 pages of the 300-page document to defence, in which it was described as a temporary phenomenon designed to economize force, gain time, hold critical areas, or disrupt an advancing enemy, pending a resumption of the all-important offence. This general neglect for the need of defensive combat, combined with other problems, caused the disasters that befell the Red Army in the summer and fall of 1941.
Much Soviet planning assumed that in case of a German invasion, the main forces of each side would need up to two weeks to meet each other and Stalin forbade any ideas of a campaign deep inside Soviet territory. Thus the Axis attack came when new organizations and promising, but untested, weapons were just beginning to trickle into operational units. Much of the Soviet Army in Europe was concentrated along the new western border of the Soviet Union, in former Polish territory that lacked significant defenses, allowing many Soviet military units to be overrun and destroyed in the first weeks of war. Initially, many Soviet units were also hampered by Semyon Timoshenko's and Georgy Zhukov's prewar orders (demanded by Joseph Stalin) not to engage or to respond to provocations (followed by a similarly damaging first reaction from Moscow, an order to stand and fight, then counterattack; this left those units vulnerable to encirclement) by a lack of experienced officers and by bureaucratic inertia.
Stalin's orders not to retreat or surrender led to static linear positions that German tanks easily breached, again quickly cutting supply lines and surrounding whole Soviet armies. Only later did Stalin allow his troops to retreat wherever possible and regroup, to mount a defense in depth, or to counterattack. More than 2.4 million Soviet troops had been captured by December 1941, by which time German and Soviet forces were fighting almost in the suburbs of Moscow. Until the end of the war, more than three million Soviet prisoners were to die from exposure, starvation, disease, or willful mistreatment by the Nazi regime.
In his memoirs, Zhukov summarized the predicament as follows:
 two or three years would have given the Soviet people a brilliant army, perhaps the best in the world… but history allotted us too small a period of peace to get everything organized as it should have been. We began many things correctly and there were many things we had no time to finish. Our miscalculation regarding the possible time of the fascist Germany's attack told greatly.  
Soviet tactical errors in the first few weeks of the offensive proved catastrophic. Initially, the Red Army was fooled by overestimation of its own capabilities. Instead of intercepting German armor, Soviet mechanised corps were ambushed and destroyed after Luftwaffe dive bombers inflicted heavy losses. Soviet tanks, poorly maintained and manned by inexperienced crews, suffered an appalling rate of breakdowns. Lack of spare parts and trucks ensured a logistical collapse. The decision not to dig in the infantry divisions proved disastrous. Lacking tanks and sufficient motorization, Soviet troops could not wage mobile warfare against the Axis.

Outcome

The climax of Operation Barbarossa came when Army Group Center, already short on supplies because of the October mud, was ordered to advance on Moscow; forward units of the 2nd Panzer Division's 38th Panzer Pioneer Battalion (38PzPi.)[ref]
Strauß, Franz Joseph, Die Geschichte der 2. (Wiener) Panzer Division, pg 337. DÖRFLER im NEBEL VERLAG, Eggolsheim DE.[/ref]
(armored engineers) came within sight of the spires of the Kremlin when they reached the rail line just south of the town of Lobnya,  from Moscow, on 1 December 1941. Soviet troops, well supplied and reinforced by fresh divisions from Siberia, defended Moscow in the Battle of Moscow, and drove the Germans back as the winter advanced. The bulk of the counter-offensive targeted Army Group Center, which was closest to Moscow.
With no shelter, few supplies, inadequate winter clothing, and chronic food shortages, German troops had no choice but to wait out the winter in the frozen wasteland. The Germans avoided being routed by Soviet counterattacks but suffered heavy casualties from battle and exposure.
At the time, the seizure of Moscow was considered the key to victory for Germany. Nowadays, historians debate whether the loss of the Soviet capital would have caused the collapse of the USSR; but Operation Barbarossa failed to achieve that goal.
The outcome of Operation Barbarossa proved a disaster for the Germans, but the Soviets were- initially- at least as badly damaged. Although the Germans had failed to take Moscow outright, they held huge areas of the western Soviet Union, including the entire regions of present-day Belarus, Ukraine, and the Baltic states, plus parts of Russia proper west of Moscow. German forces had advanced .[ref]

[/ref] The Germans held up to  before being forced to retreat after defeats at the Battle of Stalingrad (1942–43) and the Battle of Kursk (1943). However, the occupied areas were not always properly controlled by the Germans and underground activity rapidly escalated. Wehrmacht occupation was brutal from the start, due to directives issued by Hitler himself at the operation's start: he regarded the Russians as Untermenschen ("sub-humans") ruled by Jewish Bolshevik masters. This attitude alienated the population, though in some areas (such as Ukraine) some local people had been ready to consider the Germans as liberators helping to rid them of Stalin. Anti-German partisan operations intensified when Red Army units that had dissolved into the country's large uninhabited areas re-emerged as underground forces; and under repressive German policies. The Germans held on stubbornly in the face of Soviet counterattacks, resulting in huge casualties on both sides in many battles.
The war on the Eastern Front went on for four years. The death toll may never be established with any degree of certainty. A 1994 estimate of Soviet military deaths tallies 8.7 million who lost their lives either in combat or in Axis captivity.[ref]
Michael Ellman and S. Maksudov, "Soviet Deaths in the Great Patriotic War: A Note:, Europe-Asia Studies 46, No. 4, Soviet and East European History (1994), pp. 671–680
[/ref] Numbers of Soviet civilian deaths remain unclear, though roughly 20 million is a frequently cited figure. German military deaths are also to a large extent controversial. The most recent German estimate (Rüdiger Overmans) concluded that about 4.3 million Germans and a further 900,000 Axis forces lost their lives either in combat or in Soviet captivity. Operation Barbarossa counts as the single most lethal military operation in history.
The Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention. However, a month after the German invasion in 1941, Moscow made an offer for a reciprocal adherence to the Hague convention. Third Reich officials left this Soviet "note" unanswered. Penguin 2001 ISBN 0-14-100131-3 p60

Causes of the failure of Operation Barbarossa

The gravity of the beleaguered German army's situation towards the end of 1941 was due to the Red Army's increasing strength and factors that in the short run severely restricted the German forces' effectiveness. Chief among these were their overstretched deployment, a serious transport crisis and the eroded strength of most divisions. The infantry deficit that appeared by 1 September 1941, was never made good. For the rest of the war in the Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht would be short of infantry and support services.
Parallels have been drawn with Napoleon's invasion of Russia.

Underestimation of the capacity of Soviet mobilization

The German High Command grossly underestimated the mobilization potential of the Red Army. From the onset of the campaign till the end of 1941, the Soviet Union raised 825 division-equivalents,Glantz, David, The Soviet‐German War 1941–45:Myths and Realities: A Survey Essay. page 17. tapping into its mobilization pool of over 10 million men. The plan for Barbarossa assumed that the Wehrmacht would emerge victorious if it could destroy the bulk of the Red Army west of the Dvina and Dnieper rivers. By 3 July, Army Group Center had, in the Battle of Białystok–Minsk, destroyed three encircled Soviet Armies (3rd, 4th and 10th) in the vicinity of Minsk. As Army Group Center arrived at the river banks on 7 July, however, they discovered another five Soviet Armies (16th, 19th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd). By 10 July, it became clear that the assumptions regarding the result of destroying the Red Army forces west of the two rivers proved incorrect. Nonetheless, three of these Soviet Armies (16th, 19th, and 20th) were quickly encircled and eventually decimated in the vicinity of Smolensk, while the other two were severely weakened. In just the first six weeks of the invasion, which was between late June and early August, the Red Army had lost as many as 1.5 million troops (killed, wounded or captured).Glantz, David, Barbarossa Derailed: The battle for Smolensk, Volume 2, November 2010, page 19,23 In comparison, according to Halder the chief of the OKH General Staff, by 2 August Army Group Center had lost 74,500 men (killed, wounded, or missing) and had received only 23,000 replacements. By the end of August the Red Army losses rose to nearly three million (killed, wounded or captured), but that did not hinder it from raising more men for the defense of Moscow. The Soviets also quickly relocated their factories. According to one account by a German soldier, when German troops arrived at the Dnieper River they saw many intact industrial plants; by the time they crossed the river, however, the Russians had emptied every building and taken their contents east. By September it became clear that the mobilization capacity of the Red Army had been severely underestimated.
Halder wrote in his diary in 1941:Clark, Lloyd, Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943, 2012, p. 118  The whole situation makes it increasingly plain that we have underestimated the Russian colossus... But there they are, and as we smash a dozen of them the Russians simply put up another dozen. The time factor favours them, as they are near their own resources, while we are moving farther and farther away from ours. And so our troops, sprawled over the immense front line, without depth, are subject to the incessant attacks of the enemy. 
The Red Army proved it could replace huge losses quickly, and was not destroyed as a coherent force. When divisions of conscripts trained before the war were destroyed, new formations replaced them. On average, about half a million men were drafted each month for the duration of the war. The Soviets also proved very skilled in raising and training many new armies from the different ethnic populations of the far flung republics. The ability to mobilize vast (if often poorly trained and equipped) forces rapidly and continually allowed the Soviet Union to survive the critical first six months of the war.

Faults of logistical planning

At the start of the war in the dry summer, the Germans took the Soviets by surprise and destroyed a large part of the Red Army in the first weeks. When good weather gave way to the harsh autumn and winter and the Red Army recovered, the German offensive began to falter. The German army could not be supplied sufficiently for prolonged combat; indeed, there was not enough fuel for the whole army to reach its objectives.
This was well understood by the German supply units even before the operation, but their warnings were ignored. Supplying War: Logistics from Wallenstein to Patton, Cambridge, 1977. ISBN 0-521-29793-1 The entire German plan assumed that within six to eight weeks they would have attained full strategic freedom due to a complete collapse of the Red Army. Only then could they have diverted necessary logistic support to fuelling the few mobile units needed to occupy the defeated state.
German infantry and tanks stormed  In addition, road systems that looked impressive on the map, were in reality under-developed.

Weather

A paper published by the U.S. Army's Combat Studies Institute in 1981 concluded that Hitler's plans miscarried before the onset of severe winter weather. He was confident of a quick victory, so he did not prepare properly for a winter war in the Soviet Union. Moreover, his eastern army suffered more than 734,000 casualties (about 23% of its average strength of 3,200,000 troops) in the first five months of the invasion, and on 27 November 1941, General Eduard Wagner, Quartermaster General of the German Army, reported "We are at the end of our resources in both personnel and material. We are about to be confronted with the dangers of deep winter."
The German forces were unready to deal with harsh weather and the poor road network of the USSR. In September, terrain slowed the Wehrmachts progress. Few roads were paved. The ground in the USSR was very loose sand in summer, sticky muck in autumn, and heavy snow in winter. German tanks had narrow tracks with little traction and poor flotation in mud. In contrast, the new generation of Soviet tanks such as the T-34 and KV had wide tracks and were far more mobile in these conditions. The 600,000 large western European horses the Germans used for supply and artillery movement did not cope well with this weather. The smaller horses the Red Army used were much better adapted to the climate and could even scrape the icy ground with their hooves to dig up the weeds beneath.
German troops were mostly unprepared for the harsh weather changes in the rainy autumn and early winter of 1941. Equipment had been prepared for such winter conditions, but the severely overstrained transport network could not move it to the front. Consequently, the troops lacked adequate cold-weather gear, some soldiers had to pack newspapers into their jackets as temperatures dropped to below −40 °C . While at least some cold weather uniforms were available, they rarely reached the Eastern Front because Hitler ordered that supply lines give more priority to shipments of ammunition and fuel. To operate furnaces and heaters, the Germans also burned precious fuel that was in short supply. Soviet soldiers, in contrast, often had warm, quilted uniforms, felt-lined boots, and fur hats.
German weapons malfunctioned in the cold. Lubricating oils were unsuitable for these temperatures, leading to engine malfunction and misfires. To load shells into a tank's main gun, frozen grease had to be chipped off with a knife. Soviet units faced less severe problems due to their experience with cold weather. Aircraft had insulating blankets to keep their engines warm while parked. Lighter-weight oil was used. German tanks and armored vehicles could not move due to a lack of antifreeze, causing fuel to solidify. The cold was so intense that fires had to be lit under vehicles' engines before they could be started.
Because few Russian roads were paved, most of the main roads turned to mud when the rains and snow came in late October and early November.  These quagmires combined with longer supply lines to cause the German advance to stall within sight of the spires of Moscow.  The Soviet counteroffensive of December 1941 was led primarily by Siberian troops, who had trained for harsh winter combat.  They arrived from the east with numerous T-34 tanks, which had been held in reserve.  These Siberian troops advanced up to  in some sectors, proving that mobile warfare was still possible during the Russian winter.
When the severe winter began, Hitler feared a repetition of Napoleon's disastrous retreat from Moscow. He ordered the German forces to hold their ground defiantly in the face of Soviet counterattacks. This became known as the "stand or die" order. Some historians have argued that this order prevented the Germans from being routed; others contend that this order restricted Germany's ability to conduct mobile defensive warfare and led to heavy casualties due to battle and the cold.  Whatever the case, the Germans were driven back a short distance but ultimately, their defensive positions stabilized; this served to convince Hitler further that he could ignore the advice of his generals, something that proved disastrous for the Wehrmacht.

Aftermath

With the failure of the Battle of Moscow, all German plans of a quick defeat of the Soviet Union had to be revised. The Soviet counteroffensives in the winter of 1941 caused heavy casualties on both sides, but ultimately eliminated the German threat to Moscow. Nevertheless, despite this setback, the Soviet Union had suffered heavily from the loss of large parts of its army, allowing the Germans to mount another large-scale offensive in the summer of 1942, called Case Blue, now directed towards the oil fields of Baku. This offensive failed just as Barbarossa had:  the Germans again conquered vast amounts of no-mans-land, but they had again failed to achieve their ultimate goals when they were defeated at Stalingrad.  By then, the Soviet war economy was fully operational, so the Soviet Union was able to simply outproduce the Germans, who were not prepared for a long war of attrition.  As a result, the Germans' last all-out offensive in 1943 at the battle of Kursk failed. After three years of constant warfare, the Germans were exhausted; thus the Soviets were finally able to defeat the Germans decisively in Operation Bagration during the summer of 1944. This led to a chain of Soviet victories which pushed the Germans back to Berlin in just one year, leading to the surrender of Germany on 8 May 1945.
