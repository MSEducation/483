History

Kuwait's Navy was established in 1961 shortly after Britain ended the country's protectorate status and Kuwait became fully independent.
During the Invasion of Kuwait, part of the Persian Gulf War, Kuwait's navy was almost completely destroyed. and Kuwait lost 17 ships of other classes during the war.
The capture of the Exocets raised fears that Iraq might use them against coalition forces during the Gulf War. Iraq did not use them and the captured vessels were all heavily damaged or sunk by coalition forces.  During the war, the two Lürssen's that evaded Iraqi capture helped retake Kuwaiti coastal islands and oil platforms.
On 11 November 2008, Kuwait Naval Base was the location of the historic signing of the non-legally binding maritime Khawr Abd Allah Protocols otherwise known as the KAA Protocols.  The signing of the KAA Protocols by the then respective heads of the Kuwaiti Naval Force and the Iraqi Navy was the first formal and successful maritime bilateral military agreement for the co-ordinated and de-conflicted use of the Khawr Abd Allah waterway since before the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The protocols were developed and mediated by Major David Hammond RM, a British Royal Navy barrister in 2008 and they were subsequently ratified by both the Kuwaiti and Iraqi governments before the 11 November 2008 signing. They were subsequently reported to the US Congress within the December 2008 'Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq' report and the text of which have since become open source following leaks in US diplomatic notes.

Current

Major non-NATO Ally of the United States and Global War on Terrorism (2004-present)

=Naval Intervention, Prevention and Sea Deterring Missions=

In the concept of the Arab World, the application of terrorism and the narrowing of security threats is not resumed to countries of citizenships as it may be applied in functioning democratic nations; it is a tribal reality handled at the level of the Bedouin tribes and their birthplace of origin.mod.kw/MOD/Arabic_P/index.jsp,Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense,(Section Arabic Read الجيش الكويتي)
Recently, and with the beginning of the Global War on Terrorism (2001- present); the Kuwaiti Navy and Coast Guard plays a monumental role force preventing major internal and external sea and coastal terrorist attacks and crises attempting to launch deterrence for civilian maritime vessels entering and exiting Kuwaiti waters.mod.kw/MOD/Arabic_P/index.jsp,Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense,(Section Arabic Read الجيش الكويتي)
These internal and foreign sea coastal based threats are the result of the difference between proud Bedouin tribes sticking to their origins respectfully and serving the Government of Kuwait admirably while other Bedouin tribes are claiming a state of statelessness in their respective country of housing.mod.kw/MOD/Arabic_P/index.jsp,Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense,(Section Arabic Read الجيش الكويتي) 
Stateless Bedouin tribes also not from Kuwait attempt to infiltrate the country from Iraq, Iran, Syria,Jordan and Saudi Arabia; mainly via land and sea. Stateless Bedouin tribes infiltrating the country from across the region link up with parenting local tribes claiming statelessness in the host country in order to attempt to compromise the security of the targeted country.

Such a juxtaposition is witnessed across the Arab world and in countries bordering applicable tribal effects. In Kuwait, such a paradox, is seen rioting unjustifiably challenging the legitamicy of the Military of Kuwait; specially, rioting against military of the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior; the Government of Kuwait and its leadership  while claiming the enacting of inapplicable democracy when only Bedouin tribal chiefdom would govern; even with an educated, and sophisticated young generation that seems modern and promising.mod.kw/MOD/Arabic_P/index.jsp,Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense,(Section Arabic Read الجيش الكويتي)
Such a changing claim is also witnessed in other Arab countries housing major Bedouin tribes; and is probably considered by experts as the main catalyst of prevailing chaos with the governing of Arab Spring across the Arab World; a chaos that will most likely bring forth an unfitted and inexperienced tribe to power which would eventually be toppled by the rivalry of another due to the inapplicability of democracy in tribal Arab constitutionalized countries and where majority rule and loyalty always favors and serves the interest of origin of the tribe before that of a local serving government.mod.kw/MOD/Arabic_P/index.jsp,Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense,(Section Arabic Read الجيش الكويتي)
Stateless Bedouin tribal geopolitical turmoil has surfaced in the region and in Kuwait; declared one of fifteen major non-NATO allies of the United States by US President George W Bush following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks.mod.kw/MOD/Arabic_P/index.jsp,Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense,(Section Arabic Read الجيش الكويتي)
The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier along with the quest of identifying the remains of missing Kuwaiti civilians and Kuwaiti POWs are the pinnacle corps missions that represent the essence of the State of Kuwait.
