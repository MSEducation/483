[[West Coast Swing]]

CATEGORIES: West Coast Swing, Symbols of California

West Coast Swing (WCS) is a partner dance with roots in Lindy Hop. It is characterized by a distinctive elastic look that results from its basic extension-compression technique of partner connection, and is danced primarily in a slotted area on the dance floor.  The dance allows for both partners to improvise steps while dancing together, putting West Coast Swing in a short list of dances that put a premium on improvisation. Juliet McMains. 2006. Wesleyan University Press. pages 97, 213. ISBN 0-8195-6774-4. McMains includes salsa, Argentine Tango, lindy hop, and shag in this list.
Typically the follower walks into new patterns  traveling forward on counts "1" and "2" of each basic pattern, rather than rocking back. Traditional figures include 6-count and 8-count patterns of one of the four basic varieties: (1) Starter Step, (2) Side Pass, (3) Push Break / Sugar Push, (4) Whip.anchorsteps.com
Alternatively the basic patterns in WCS are defined as: Sugar Push; Left Side Pass; Righ Side Pass; Touch Turn; and Whip. Virtually all other moves in WCS are variations of these basic patterns. 
The Anchor Step is a common ending pattern of many West Coast Swing figures. Skippy Blair. 1978. page 113. ISBN 0-932980-01-5

History

It is believed that the origins of the WCS are in Lindy Hop. In a 1947 book, Arthur Murray recognized that, "There are hundreds of regional dances of the Jitterbug type. Each section of the country seems to have a variation of its own." How to become a Good Dancer by Arthur Murray 1947 Simon and Schuster. revised edition. page 175.
Dean Collins, who arrived in the Los Angeles area around 1937, was influential in developing the style of swing dance on the West Coast of the United States, as both a performer and teacher. When his wife, Mary Collins, was asked if Dean was responsible for the emergence of the dance, however, she said that Dean insisted there were "only two kinds of swing dance - good and bad". "The Dean of Swing". Kiku Loomis. June 2001. pages 82, 83.Swing Dance Hall of Fame Dean Collins
Lauré Haile, Arthur Murray National Dance Director, and an instructor of teachersDance Teacher Now. November–December 1986 page 27. documented swing dancing as done in the Los Angeles area and used the name "Western Swing". Murray had used the same name, "Western Swing", in the late 1930s for a different dance.
Western Swing was also called "Sophisticated Swing" in the 1950s.

Staged by a young Dick Di Augustin, the dancing includes recognizable patterns such as the chicken walk, swing out from closed position, etc., along with the classic woman's walk walk triple step triple step at the end of the slot. On the final step of the second triple the women are weighted left with the right heel on the floor and the toes pointed up. Dancers also do classic Lindy flips at the end of the slot, as well as non partner, non West Coast Swing movements.Hot Rod Gang @ YouTube
Murray's taught Western Swing beginning from a closed position and the possibility of dancing single, double, or triple rhythm.

Slot

West Coast Swing is a slotted dance. The slot is an imaginary area, long and thin, eight or nine feet long if danced at a very slow Tempo, but shorter if the music is at a faster tempo. The follower travels back and forth in the slot dancing straight through the lead. The leader consistently moves a minimum amount (at mid-way point) to his sides, barely out of her way. She lightly brushes against him each time she passes him. Thomas L. Nelson. 2008. second edition. Authorhouse. page 6.168. ISBN 978-1-4343-5960-5  Brushing seems rare these days though (2009).
Socially, it is considered good etiquette (particularly on a crowded floor) to use a fixed slot, in order to allow dancing without incident.Swing Dance Encyclopedia. Thomas L. Nelson. 2008. second edition. Authorhouse. page 6.218. ISBN 978-1-4343-5960-5 If the dance floor is not crowded and the couple is afforded more space, such as during a competitive event, the dancers may move the slot around the floor more liberally.
There are urban myths regarding the origin of the slotted style. According to one version, it was an invention of Hollywood film makers who wanted "dancers to stay in the same plane, to avoid going in and out of focus".outtodance.html A viewing of films featuring the work of Dean Collins in the 1940s, and rock 'n' roll films made in the mid-1950s reveals the fact that dancers turn frequently and inevitably turn their backs to the camera.
Slotted moves were a common part of the step vocabulary of Lindy and/or Jitterbug dancers during the 1940s and 1950s. Rather than the walk, walk of West Coast Swing, however, two sets of triple steps were used when the woman moved down the slot, followed by a rock step rather than the current triple and anchor step.

Music

The origins of the dance that became known as West Coast Swing can be traced to the swing era. During this period many jazz, blues, and western musicians incorporated, or emphasized, the "swing" in their music. Writing in the "Arthur Murray Silver Dance Notebook", Lauré Haile, who first described "Western Swing", listed the following songs/records as "Good Swing or Fox Trot Records":Arthur Murray Silver Dance Notebook, Lauré Haile, 195?, page 10. no ISBN or copyright in one line database copyright database[ref]*This url has a sample of Dorsey's "Dry Bones", but is on the Crown label.

Big Bands continued to flourish in the 1950s, touring, selling records, and appearing on radio and the new medium of television. As the decade wore on, however, many mostly younger listeners preferred to hear the simpler and (some say) noisier music given the name Rock 'n' Roll, and this music became known as the most popular music for dancing.The Palomar - Remembering Big Bands, the Swing Era
West Coast Swing-like moves can be seen in rock 'n' roll films made in that era.
While teenagers preferred to freestyle dance through a constantly changing succession of discothèque social dance fads during the 1960s, adults kept Swing alive. John G. Youmans. Goodyear Publishing Company, Inc. 1969. page 25. Library of Congress Number 69-17984
Western Swing was documented in the 1971 edition of the "Encyclopedia of Social Dance", listing the "Coaster Step" (with a forward step as the last step of the 2nd triple) rather than the Anchor Step. The one song that was listed for this dance was "Comin' On" by Bill Black's Combo (1964 Hi #2072).
In the mid-1970s, disco music and dancing repopularized "touch" partner dancing, and, in California, West Coast Swing was one of the dances of the era. Skippy Blair. 1978. pages 113-119 ISBN 0-932980-01-5  By the 1990s country western dancers were dancing West Coast Swing to contemporary country western songs. West Coast Swing is now one of many dances done at country western venues.
In practice, West Coast Swing may be danced to almost any music in 4/4 time, and music of many different styles may be found in an evening of West Coast Swing dancing.

Styles

West Coast Swing can be danced to almost any music written in 4/4 time at speeds ranging from very slow to very fast; 15 to 45 Measures per Minute, ideally at 32 Measures per Minute (15x4=60 bpm, 32x4 = 128 bpm, 45x4=180 bpm). The character of the dance changes over that range. At the slowest speeds the dance tends to exhibit a highly elastic connection with the possibility of very sexy, "slinky" walks for the lady, and a slight backward leaning poise at the full extent of the connection. At faster speeds the partners become more upright and the connection shortens with more of a "push and pull" feel and look.dancecoquitlam.html
The "ideal" speed for WCS has been cited as 32 Measures per Minute (32x4 = 128 bpm), compared to advice to choose "records that are around 28 mpm" (28x4= 112 bpm) for "Western Swing". Albert and Josephine Butler. 1971 & 1975. Albert Butler Ballroom Dance Service. New York, NY. page 140 (1971). no ISBN or other ID
In writing about West Coast Swing, Skippy Blair advises that, "The only problem that exists in SWING is when someone decides there is only ONE WAY to dance it. There is never only ONE WAY to do anything ..." "'Try on' different styles that you admire in other people..."
Dancing to different types of music gives a different feel and look.

the man moving off and on the center of the track for most moves, and a heavy "couple weight";
Modern with more free arm extensions, and emphasis on how many spins, etc., the man can lead.

The man's "couple hand" is fixed in space on beat 3 in a pass or push.
In 1994 Blair noted that the posture for men was more upright than in previous years. Skippy Blair. 1994. Altera. page 6. ISBN 0-932980-11-2.

Basic Guidelines

West Coast Swing is an evolving social dance that has gone through many changes throughout its short history, over time incorporating techniques from numerous dance styles. However, there are many guidelines that should be followed to maintain the true character of the dance. A dance's character is typically defined by a basic philosophy, principles of movement, and traditional steps and figures. Ruud Vermey. Kastell Verlag (January 1, 1994). 192 pages. ISBN 3924592446 While these guidelines can be violated, by committing too many violations one risks departing from the defining features of the dance.
Philosophically, Modern West Coast Swing is in large part defined by an emphasis on Musicality and Connection. Traditional figures include 6-count and 8-count patterns of one of the four basic varieties: (1) Starter Step, (2) Side Pass, (3) Push Break / Sugar Push, (4) Whip. Many common WCS figures are derived from simple variations of these basic figures.
Technical guidelines are as follows:
Every figure or pattern should end with an anchor step, a critical characteristic feature of WCS. This is used to mark the end of a figure and re-establish connection between the two dancers.
The leader should maintain the slot.
The leader should use his own weight changes to lead the lady's movement, not the arm or hand alone.
The follower should continue to the end of the slot.
The follower should assume a triple-step count unless led otherwise.
Both closed and open positions are acceptable.
A connection should be maintained at all times, using some combination of physical and visual connections.
Most steps are danced in 2-beat groups, allowing 6-count and 8-count figures to be extended and shortened as necessary to fit the music.
The leader should plan ahead in the dance to allow the follower to experience musical accents.Dance Jam Productions MAD JAM 2011 VIDEO NOTEBOOK DVD: Workshop by Bill Cameron

A few basic moves that any WCS dancer should know are listed below. They are performed with the same "step step tri-ple-step tri-ple-step" pattern equalling eight steps in six beats of music. The term "count" is used as a synonym for a "beat", usually a quarter note, of music.
