Palacio de Lecumberri is located at the North East border of Mexico City's Federal District. The building was used as a prison from 1900-1976, and as the Countri National Archive from 1980 onwards.
The prison was mainly constructed to contain major political advisers of the opposing side, or other criminals to the nation from the time of operation. Construction began in 1888.
The inspiration and design of the Palacio is by Miguel S. Macedo, who was later on imprisoned there for several months during the Mexican Revolution. The design is said to have been based on that of Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon. 2, 2008), a Mexican journal for the diffusion of science published by Editorial Televisa Internacional (ISSN 0188-0659.
This design allows for a single guard to observe all the prisoners without them being able to tell when the guard is looking; they therefore act as though they are always being watched.
The prison was built to hold 800 men, 180 women and 400 children. It had 804 cells, workshops,
a nursery, cooking and baking workshops. They was also an area of government, a section dedicated to medical and waiting rooms.

Living conditions

The Diary of Lecumberri by Colombian Poet Álvaro Mutis,  describes his time there after being imprisoned in 1958. The living conditions within the prison were very dangerous due the inmates treatment
by the guards or staff. Torture and beating were common

Inmates

The majority of the early inmates were political threats to Porfirio Díaz and his Administration. During the "Dirty war" in the 1970s it held left wing political prisoners.
There were a few notable people imprisoned there over the years including: David Alfaro Siqueiros, Juan Gabriel, Roberto "Anulfo" Villegas,  Heberto Castillo, Trotsky's murderer Ramón Mercader, Gregorio Cárdenas Hernández and José Revueltas.
During La decena trágica in 1913, President Francisco I. Madero and Vice President José María Pino Suárez were murdered while en route to  Lecumberri.
Throughout its 76-year use as a prison, only two people escaped alive. The first, Pancho Villa, was a general of the Mexican Revolution who made his escape in 1912. They later authored a book about their experiences entitled Escape (ISBN 0-913374-76-8).

National Achieves

The Archivo General de la Nación (General Archive of the Nation) is charged by the Mexican state to
"be the governing body of the national archives and the central consultative entity of the Federal Executive." The writer Edmundo O'Gorman was its general director from 1938 until 1952. It is considered the most important among its class in the Americas and one of the most important in the entire world. In November 1976 the Prison was decommissioned on the order of President Luis Echeverria and turned over to the National Archive in 1980.
The archive houses millions of pages of the country's documentary heritage. Former prison cells are now used as record repositories and the corridors between them are used as galleries in which researchers can sit and read. In June 2002, 60,000 secret police files held within the archives were opened to the public by President Vicente Fox. The files document the government's actions during the Dirty War.
