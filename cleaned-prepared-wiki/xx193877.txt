Stephenson Clarke Shipping Limited, established in 1730, in liquidation 26 July 2012, was Great Britain's oldest shipping company.  The company had specialized in short sea bulk cargo such as aggregates, alumina, grain, coal, fertilizers and steel.

History

Reverend Ralph Clarke, a vicar of Long Benton, Tyneside had two sons, Ralph and Robert Clarke.  The boys went to sea, working their way up to being master mariners.
During their career at sea, they  began to buy shares in ships, gradually making the transition from captain to owner.  The company that would become Stephenson Clarke was formed when the brothers bought shares in a 300-ton sailing vessel.  Thus the business was established in 1730, in the early years of the reign of King George II.
Stephenson Clarke had managed other owners' ships as well as its own. For several decades it managed the collier fleets of the Gas Light and Coke Company and other gas and electricity utility companies.
