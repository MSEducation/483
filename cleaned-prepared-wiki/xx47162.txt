[[Anusvara]]

CATEGORIES: Brahmic diacritics


Anusvara (Sanskrit: ) is the diacritic used to mark a type of nasalization used in a number of Indic scripts. Depending on the location of the anusvara in the word and the language within which it is used, its exact pronunciation can vary greatly.

In the Devanagari script, anusvara is represented with a dot (bindu) above the letter (मं). In IAST, the corresponding symbol is ).

Sanskrit

Hindi

In  Standard Hindi, the ), which indicates vowel nasalization. In practice, however, the two are often used interchangeably.
The precise phonetic value of the phoneme, whether represented by 
Word-finally it is realized as nasalization of the preceding vowel (e.g.  "tail").
It is pronounced as a homorganic nasal, with the preceding vowel becoming nasalized allophonically, in the following cases: between a long vowel and a voiced plosive ( "a chest").
The last rule has two sets of exceptions where the  "laughter".

Nepali

In Nepali, chandrabindu and anusvara have the same pronunciation similarly to Hindi. Therefore, there is a great deal of variation regarding which occurs in any given position. So many words containing anusvara have alternative spellings with chandrabindu instead of anusvara and vice versa.

Other Indic script languages

Anusvara is used in other languages using Indic scripts as well, usually to represent suprasegmental phones (such as phonation type or nasalization), or for other nasal sounds.

Bengali

In the Bengali script, the anusvara diacritic (অনুস্বার onushshar in Bengali) is written as a circle above a slanted line (ং), and represents . It has merged in pronunciation with the letter ঙ ungô in Bengali. Although the anusvara is a consonant in Bengali phonology, it is nevertheless treated in the written system as a diacritic in that it is always directly adjacent to the preceding consonant, even when spacing consonants apart in titles or banners (e.g. বাং-লা-দে-শ bang-la-de-sh, not বা-ং-লা-দে-শ ba-ng-la-de-sh for বাংলাদেশ Bangladesh), it is never pronounced with the inherent vowel "ô", and it cannot take a vowel sign (instead, the consonant ঙ ungô is used pre-vocalically).

Burmese

In the Burmese script, the anusvara ()

Sinhala

In the Sinhala script, the anusvara is not a diacritic but an independent grapheme. It has circular shape (ං), which is why it is called binduva in Sinhala, which means "dot". The anusvara represents . It has merged in pronunciation with the letter ඞ ṅa in Sinhala.

Telugu

The Telugu script has full-Zero(anusvāra) ం	, half-zero (arthanusvāra) and Visarga to convey various shades of nasal sounds. Anusvara is represented as a circle shape after a letter.  
Ex: క - Ka and కం - Kam

Anunasika

Anunasika () is a form of vowel nasalization, often represented by an anusvara. It is a form of open mouthed nasalization akin to the nasalization of vowels followed by "n" or "m" in Parisian French. When "n" or "m" follow a vowel, the "n" or "m" becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasal (i.e. pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part or all of the air to leave through the nostrils).  Anunasika is sometimes called a subdot because of its IAST representation.
In Devanagari and related orthographies it is represented by the chandrabindu diacritic (example: मँ ).
In Burmese, the anunasika, called  nasalized ending, when attached as a dot above a letter. The anunasika represents the -m final in Pali.
