History

Establishment

The Weekly Sillimanian traces its origins to the launching of the first campus publication of the then Silliman Institute named as Silliman Truth.  As the first periodical in the Province of Negros Oriental at that time, the little magazine that it was served both the public and the campus. Copies were mailed to the Presbyterian Board and to other subscribers.  Varied in terms of content, the publication was multilingual.  English, Spanish and Cebuano were interchangeably used.
During the early years of the Silliman Truth (1903â€“1918), the publication was edited primarily by American missionaries.  However, on August 1918 a decision was made to assign the editing  to Junior and Senior English students.  This evolutionized the paper from being a missionary-edited publication to that of a student organ.

Transformation

By the year 1920, the missionary-founded Silliman Truth was foreshadowed by the emergence of an outright student periodical bearing the name Sillimanian. 
In 1958, the school paper first competed in the Columbia Scholastic Press Association Contest in Columbia University, a member of the Ivy League, and won several First Place awards."Dumaguete Timeline". Department of Trade and Industry. Retrieved 2011-04-22.
In 1967, the daily Sillimanian became a weekly and served primarily as a school publication.  Due to lack of a regular and reliable community periodical in Dumaguete during that period, the Sillimanian continued to contain a community portion where events of Dumaguete and Negros Oriental are published. In the 1970s, an experiment was made to hand over total control of the paper to the student body.  The position of a faculty adviser was abolished and because of this administrative action,  the school paper eventually fell into the hands of militant activists.

Weekly Sillimanian

After school papers in the country were allowed to resume in 1974, the Sillimanian was revived as a fortnightly in 1975 and resumed as a weekly in June 1976. Since its resumption, the Sillimanian has been referred to as the Weekly Sillimanian and continues to be named as such today.  At times, it is abbreviated with three letters: a small letter "t" and two capitalized letters "W" and "S" forming tWS. 
At present, the school paper is assigned with a faculty adviser and placed under supervision of the University's Office of Information and Publications. The tWS office is currently situated at the Oriental Hall, SU Campus, Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental, Philippines.
