As interim Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability from October 2008 to May 2009, he was responsible for overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) that was a major component of the U.S. government's response to the financial crisis of 2007–08. A Republican, he is running for Governor of California in the 2014 election.
Born and raised in Ohio and educated at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Kashkari worked initially as an aerospace engineer. After attending business school at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, he became an investment banker, covering the information technology security sector for Goldman Sachs.
When Henry Paulson, the former head of Goldman, was appointed Secretary of the Treasury in 2006, he brought Kashkari on as an aide. Kashkari was eventually named Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Economics and Development. At Treasury he played a number of roles in the response to the financial crisis and the subprime mortgage crisis that preceded it, most notably administering TARP.
Kashkari left government in May 2009 and began working for Pimco later that year, leading that company's push into the equities market. In January 2013 he resigned from Pimco to explore a run for public office. On January 21, 2014, he announced his candidacy for Governor of California.

The New York Times, May 30, 2006. Accessed Dec. 30, 2013. Kashkari contacted Paulson and asked to join him at Treasury. Despite not knowing Kashkari well, Paulson had him flown to Washington, D.C., and offered him a job as a policy generalist shortly after Kashkari had begun his pitch. Kashkari accepted, and then Paulson remembered to confirm that Kashkari was a Republican. 84–5. After the U.S. Senate confirmed Paulson, he and Kashkari started at Treasury on the same day.

A growing crisis

Beginning in summer 2007, the value of some financial instruments backed by U.S. subprime mortgages declined sharply as it became clear that many of the borrowers would default on the mortgages. This caused a crisis as the banks holding the mortgages saw their assets decline in value and rushed to foreclose the loans. This ultimately intensified into a global financial crisis with broad implications.
Kashkari played important roles in several episodes of the crisis. He led Treasury's participation in the Hope Now Alliance, a mortgage industry initiative coordinated by the federal government in October 2007 that aimed to reduce foreclosures by modifying loan terms on a loan-by-loan basis. Subprime: 'HopeNow' may help only so much. CNNMoney. 12, 2007. Accessed Jan. 2, 2014. In March 2008 he represented Treasury at negotiations that led ultimately to the federally sponsored takeover and rescue of the investment bank Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase. He was in charge of Treasury's efforts to create a market in the U.S. for covered bonds, whose value would continue to be guaranteed by the issuing bank after the bank had sold them. Paulson pushes 'covered bonds' in housing fix. NPR, Jul. 29, 2008. Accessed Jan. 2, 2014. He also worked closely with Paulson on Treasury's takeover of the government sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Septempber 6, 2008, and the federal bailout of American International Group on September 16.
In March 2008 Kashkari began to worry that, if the Bush administration never received the authority it needed to deal with the growing crisis, the next administration would blame them for everything wrong in the economy. Paulson scoffed at this idea, particularly Kashkari's speculation that Barack Obama, then a candidate in that year's presidential election, would win the presidency and use the crisis to ride to popularity just as former President Ronald Reagan had following the Iran hostage crisis. 92–3.

TARP

In early 2008, Paulson directed Kashkari and fellow Treasury aide Phillip Swagel to write a plan to recapitalize the banking system in case the crisis worsened. 83–4. The plan called for Congress to authorize Treasury to spend $500 billion to buy mortgage-backed securities from troubled banks, replacing them on banks' balance sheets with safe, liquid Treasury bills. This would prevent runs on the banks and encourage them to lend. The plan was conceived as an alternative to proposals from the staff of the House Financial Services Committee, then led by Democratic Representative Barney Frank. In Fed We Trust. Crown Business, 2010, pp. 176–7.
Following the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) was enacted on October 3. Kashkari was one of several Paulson aides who was heavily involved in the crafting the legislation. Andrews. For Treasury Dept., now comes hard part of bailout. The New York Times, Oct. 4, 2008. Accessed Jan. 2, 2014. Based in large part on Kashkari and Swagel's recapitalization plan, the act created created the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), a $700 billion bailout fund for financial institutions threatened with collapse. Kashkari favored getting distressed assets away from the banks the most among Treasury staff. Stewart. Eight days. The New Yorker, Sep. 21, 2009. Accessed Jan. 8, 2014. He initially proposed a $1 trillion fund, but Paulson vetoed that number as too large. Kashkari came up with the lesser figure of $700 billion by taking 5% of the $14 trillion in then-outstanding mortgages in the United States. 450
To administer TARP, the EESA created within the Treasury Department a new Office of Financial Stability to be headed by an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability to be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. However, it also specified that the Treasury Secretary could designate an interim Assistant Secretary to run the office. Kashkari first came to widespread public attention on October 6, when Paulson named him to this position,Patrick Rucker. Treasury names rescue program chief. Reuters, Oct. 6, 2008. Accessed Jan. 3, 2014. earning Kashkari the nicknames "bailout czar" and "the $700 billion man". During his time running TARP he retained his title as Assistant Secretary for International Economics and Development, but his international affairs responsibilities were delegated to another Treasury official.
The program underwent some change after its creation. On October 13, Kashkari announced in a speech that TARP would not only purchase distressed mortgage assets from banks, as had been announced already, but would also purchase stock in the banks themselves.

With Bush scheduled to leave office on January 20, 2009, following the November 2008 election, Kashkari's appointment was initially viewed as temporary. There were even plans to replace him before Bush left office. Bush praised by both parties for transition planning. Bloomberg News, Nov. 3, 2003. Accessed Jan. 3, 2014.

During his time heading TARP, Kashkari was frequently called to testify before Congressional oversight panels. The House members would often question him hostilely over the politically unpopular program, but at least one, Representative Dennis Kucinich, assured Kashkari privately that he thought Kashkari was doing a great job. Another public critic, Representative Gregory Meeks, later thanked Kashkari for his service.
