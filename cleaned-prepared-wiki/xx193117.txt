History

AlpInvest as it is currently known, was established in 1999 as an initiative by its two sponsors, the Dutch pension funds ABP and PFZW (then PGGM), to create an independent and professional manager for their private equity allocations.
AlpInvest's predecessor, NIB Capital Private Equity, originally operated as one integrated investment firm with distinct teams focusing on fund investments as well as lead buyout investments in mid-sized companies located in the Benelux and Germany.  As the firm evolved, AlpInvest shifted its focus toward an expansion of its investment management business.
In 2000, AlpInvest expanded its investment platform, by creating a dedicated equity co-investment team to invest in transactions alongside its core private equity managers.  The following year, in 2001, the firm began a formal effort to make mezzanine investments.  A year later, in 2002, AlpInvest launched a secondary investment platform, which has emerged as one of the largest buyers of private equity assets in the secondaries market.
Today, AlpInvest focuses exclusively on its investment management business as a fund investor as well as secondary investor and equity and mezzanine co-investor and has grown into one of the largest investors in the private equity asset class.
