The Institut Lillois d'Ingéniérie de la Santé (ILIS) can be translated as the Lille Institute of Management and Health Sciences.  It forms part of the Lille II University Law and Health.  It is an institution allowed to deliver Bachelor and Master degrees in Health Sciences.  The ILIS lays a special emphasis on students acquiring a broad range of professional skills and work experience during theirs years of study and before graduating.  In essence quite close to the German model of University of Applied Sciences or Fachhochschule, the Institute is keen to let its students accumulate work experience so as to allow them a chance to compete with engineer and business schools on the job market.It has recently been renamed Faculty of Health Management and Health Engineering while keeping the acronym ILIS.
