North Carolina Highway 147 is a North Carolina state highway.  The route connects the Research Triangle Park to both Western Wake County and the city of Durham.

Route Description

The route's entire length is a limited access freeway; linking NC 540 in Morrisville with the Research Triangle Park (RTP), Downtown Durham and Interstates 40 and 85.  It is a fairly urbanized commuter-route and suffers from peak-traffic during conventional rush hours. Speed limits on the freeway range from .  
From NC 540 to Interstate 40, the highway is a toll road, part of the Triangle Expressway.  Tolling on this stretch of NC 147 began on January 3, 2012.
Its northern terminus with Interstate 85 is a partial interchange, where northbound NC 147 merges onto southbound I-85 and vice-versa. Travelers wanting to go north on I-85 and vice-versa must utilize the nearby U.S. 15-501 freeway.

In 1979, planners said many of the city's roads needed widening, and the decision was made to extend the freeway to I-85. The first section in 1982 disrupted the Crest Street neighborhood, but the N.C. DOT moved 181 houses instead of tearing them down, an action that resulted in a 1987 third-place Federal Highway Administration award for "historic preservation and cultural enhancement".  Eventually, the problems that caused the original I-40 extension to I-85 to be delayed were overcome, and NC 147 was extended through the city. 
On September 6, 2011, the south termini at T.W. Alexander Drive (exit 4) was permanently closed to make way for NC 147's extension to NC 540 in Morrisville; this made I-40 the temporary southern termini for three months.  On December 8, 2011, the southern extension was opened.  Dubbed the Triangle Parkway, the 

Future

There are two future projects involving NC 147.  The first is the East End Connector (Currently in planning and environmental study).
