Alfonso was born in Madrid, Spain, the elder son of Infante Antonio, Duke of Galliera and  his wife, Infanta Eulalia of Spain.  On his paternal side he was a grandson of Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, while on his maternal side he was a grandson of  Queen Isabella II of Spain. On 30 November 1886, in the Royal Palace of Madrid, he was baptised with the names Alfonso María Francisco Antonio Diego."Spain", The Times ( 1 December 1886): 5.
In 1899 Alfonso and his younger brother Luis Fernando were sent to England to be educated by the Jesuits at Beaumont College.  They remained there until 1904.

In 1906 Alfonso graduated from the Academia Militar de Toledo (Military Academy of Toledo). In 1910 he trained as a pilot in France. Upon returning to Spain, be successfully become one of the first and most distinguished aviators in the Spanish military. He served as chief of aerial operations for the 1925 amphibious landings at Al Hoceima in Morocco.
In May 1930 Alfonso was a passenger on the Graf Zeppelin flight from Seville to Brazil."20 Engage Passage for Ocean Flight", The New York Times ( 19 May 1930): 5; "Zeppelin Flies to Seville", The New York Times ( 20 May 1930): 1.  He then continued in the Graf Zeppelin to New York City and visited President Herbert Hoover in Washington, D.C., before returning to Spain.
On 27 February 1931, Alfonso was named Chief of Staff of the Spanish Air Force and Commander of the First Aero District by his cousin King Alfonso XIII."King Makes Cousin Madrid Air Chief", The New York Times ( 28 February 1931): 20.
After the founding of the Second Spanish Republic on 14 April 1931, Alfonso was exiled to London. When he returned to Spain in 1932, he was imprisoned at Villa Cisneros (now Dakhla, Western Sahara). On 1 January 1933, Alfonso and some thirty other monarchist prisoners escaped in a boat, travelling 1800 miles to Lisbon."Ragged Spanish Grandees Tell of Escape", The New York Times ( 16 January 1933): 1.
In 1937 after the start of the Spanish Civil War Alfonso returned to Spain to head the aerial forces of General Francisco Franco. At the end of the war, he was promoted to general. He was made head of the Second Division Air Force in 1940. Three years later, he was promoted to brigadier general.
For many years Alfonso was the unofficial representative in Spain of the Count of Barcelona, the son and heir of King Alfonso XIII. In 1941 Alfonso was godfather for the Count of Barcelona's younger son Alfonso. In 1945, Alfonso resigned his position in the Spanish Air Force to show his support for the Estoril Manifesto, a manifesto of the Count of Barcelona arguing for the restoration of the monarchy. This decision put an end to his military career although he continued to pilot aircraft as a civilian.

On 15 July 1909, Alfonso married Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1884–1966), daughter of Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (second son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom)."The Marriage of Princess Beatrice of Coburg", The Times (17 July 1909): p. 5; "Princess Beatrice Married", The New York Times (16 July 1909): p. 4 There was a civil ceremony in Schloss Rosenau, followed by a Catholic religious ceremony in St. Augustine's Church in Coburg, and finally a Protestant religious ceremony in Schloss Callenberg.

Beatrice had been raised Protestant, and chose not to convert to Catholicism."Princess Held to Faith", The New York Times ( 19 July 1909): 1. Several days after the marriage it was revealed that King Alfonso XIII had no personal objection to the marriage: indeed, he encouraged it and used his influence to obtain a dispensation so as to allow a Catholic ceremony. Nevertheless, the Spanish government insisted that the marriage of a Spanish infante to a Protestant could not receive official approval."King Alfonso Aided Cousin's Marriage", The New York Times (24 July 1909): p. 4
