[[Phi Tau Sigma]]

CATEGORIES: 1953 establishments in Massachusetts, Honor societies, University of Massachusetts Amherst

Phi Tau Sigma (or ΦΤΣ) is the Honor Society for food science and technology students. The organization was founded in 1953 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst by Dr. Gideon E. (Guy) Livingston, a food technology professor. It was incorporated under the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  on 8 December 1953, as "Phi Tau Sigma Honorary Society, Inc."

Charter Members

Besides Livingston, the charter members of the Honor Society were M.P. Baldorf, Robert V. Decareau, E. Felicotti, W.D. Powrie, M.A. Steinberg, and D.E. Westcott.

Purposes

Members

Phi Tau Sigma has over 1000 members, who are kept up-to-date on Society matters through a monthly Newsletter from the Executive Secretary.
Members are elected as students or after graduation in recognition of their achievements and to facilitate their active participation in Phi Tau Sigma and the profession of Food Science and Technology.

As of 2014, there are 41 Chapters (primarily at educational institutions, including the following) in the U.S., Mexico and China. These are formed to better serve the members at the local level. In chronological order of being chartered:

Relationship with the Institute of Food Technologists

Phi Tau Sigma is a body with its own elected Officers and separate from the scientific professional organization, the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). Over the years its relationship with IFT has varied; but currently it has a mutual and respectful partnership with IFT in the following areas:
•		Since the 1984 IFT Annual Meeting, each year it presents the Dr. Carl R. Fellers Award for "service to the field of food science and technology; and for bringing honor and recognition to the profession of food science and technology through a distinguished career displaying exemplary leadership, service, and communication skills that enhance the effectiveness of all food scientists in serving society". The Award is named for Dr. Carl R. Fellers, a food science professor who chaired the food technology department at the University of Massachusetts where the first Phi Tau Sigma Chapter was founded in 1953.
The deadline for applications for the 2014 Award was 15 January 2014.

•		In 1978 the first ΦTΣ Graduate Paper Competition was initiated at the Annual Meeting of IFT.  The competition included both written and oral presentations. At that time, the competition was open to any student who attended the IFT Annual Meeting.  Six winners were selected across the United States. Today (in July 2013), the Student Competition is still sponsored by Phi Tau Sigma but there were approximately 150 winning students recognized for their excellence in research in different specific disciplines of food science and technology (IFT Divisions) or by their written skills or oral presentation skills at the graduate and undergraduate levels. During the IFT Annual Meeting a Phi Tau Sigma event is organized at which the winners are recognized. In addition recognition is made of the winner of the Dr. Carl R. Fellers Award, the Phi Tau Sigma Special Recognition Award, the Phi Tau Sigma Student Achievement Award, the Dr. Daryl B. Lund International Scholarship, the Dr. Gideon "Guy" Livingston Scholarship, and the Phi Tau Sigma Founders' Award. Additionally, the new Phi Tau Sigma officers are announced. Any new Chapters of Phi Tau Sigma that have been formed in the past year are recognized and presented with their Charter.
•		In 2012 a new tradition began thanks to Dr. Robert Shewfelt and Dr. S. Suzanne Nielsen.  These two Lifetime Members of Phi Tau Sigma worked with the Education Division of IFT to cosponsor symposia and provide recognition to the Achievement Award Recipients.
•		In 2013, Phi Tau Sigma, for the first time, garnered the support and cooperation from the Council of Food Science Administrators.  This powerful and influential group represents the Departments and Colleges of Food Science and/or Technology across the United States.  Phi Tau Sigma was fortunate to cosponsor a number of sessions/workshops on professional/soft skill development this year.
