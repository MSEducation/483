Career as Mayor

Accomplishments

During Kelly's time as Mayor, the region installed a large and long-delayed sewage treatment system known as Halifax Harbour Solutions which came into operation in 2008, broke down and was restored in 2010. The city has an attracted several large profile national events such as the 2011 Canada Winter Games and some international events such as Tall Ships Visits. A popular outcome of the Canada Winter Games was the conversion of the temporary speed skating oval into a permanent facility for speed skating and outdoor public skating. In 2007, Kelly withdrew Halifax's bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games over concerns about the rapidly escalating costs of the games."Halifax Drops out of Commonwealth Games", CBC News, March 8, 2007.
Kelly has overseen a new regional development plan and an urban development plan for Downtown Halifax known as "Halifax By Design". In November 2011, the city approved and began a long-delayed construction of a new central public library. Peter Kelly pushed for an expansion of a community center in the nation's largest African Canadian community of North Preston.halifax.html Along with the community center in North Preston, Kelly's administration saw the construction of seven fire halls, five recreational complexes, the World Trade and Convention Centre. Also, he saw the construction of the Halifax Central Library.ca/news/halifax/429489/peter-kelly-hoping-to-remembered-as-a-mayor-of-the-people/ 
Kelly was the first and only mayor to apologize for the razing of Africville, backing it up was a $5 million reparation plan for the black community, of which $3 million was paid by the city. In 2011 a commemorative church and interpretive centre was constructed as part of, what is now called the Africville Apology. "Halifax apologizes for razing Africville". CBC News, February 24, 2010. 
During Kelly's term in office, he pushed for infrastructure growth by the removal of the Cogswell Interchange. Originally constructed in 1970 to be part of a highway that was never completed, it has been called "the road to nowhere" by local residents, and served very little practical use. Kelly had numerous reports conducted as mayor, and began the first phase in revitalization. The demolition which is scheduled to begin in 2015 will free 16 acres of land in downtown Halifax.ca/news/halifax/939617/halifax-inches-closer-to-demolition-of-cogswell-interchange/

Criticisms

Kelly was criticized for the failure of the city's Harbour Solutions sewage treatment plant which has faced delays and breakdowns."Halifax mayor takes 'full responsibility' sic for sewage treatment failure". CBC News, June 19, 2009. 
Another criticism followed a $400,000 loan of public money for a Black Eyed Peas concert in 2010 which was not approved by HRM council or reviewed by the city's legal department. The loan was not repaid when the promoter went out of business."Kelly staying, Anstey leaving". The Chronicle Herald, March 16, 2011. Retrieved March 22, 2011.

Kelly is also criticized for his performance as the executor of the will of 91-year-old Mary Thibeault. Kelly was appointed as executor by Nova Scotia's probate court as requested in Thibeault's will. He was one of 18 heirs to the estate of about half a million dollars. The heirs which included several elderly people and charities waited eight years for the estate to be resolved, a process that usually takes 18 months."A trust betrayed: Peter Kelly and the estate of Mary Thibeault".

Kelly's role in the eviction of the NS Occupy Protests on Remembrance Day 2011 has caused controversy. Occupy protesters agreed to temporarily move out of Halifax's Grand Parade for the Remembrance Day ceremony and shifted their camp to Victoria Park. Though Kelly stated that he supported and respected the cooperation of protesters, offering an alternative location for the protest camp, but also supported the eviction and arrest of 14 protesters just minutes after the close of the Remembrance Day ceremonies."Occupy protesters to move for Remembrance Day". CBC News, October 31, 2011."Occupy N.S. protesters plan next move after eviction". CBC News, November 11, 2011. The eviction was approved by HRM council in a closed-door meeting chaired by Kelly on November 8. The decision to evict the protesters on a holiday weekend cost Halifax taxpayers an extra $106,000 in overtime costs."More than $100K Spent to Evict Occupy NS", Global Maritimes, November 15, 2011. In response to charges that the city betrayed the trust of an agreement between the city, veterans and Occupy NS, Kelly stated that the decision was up to council and the eviction was an operational police matter."Interview with Mayor Peter Kelly on Occupy eviction".
