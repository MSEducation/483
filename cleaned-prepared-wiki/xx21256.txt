The James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) is a non-profit organization founded in 1996 by magician and skeptic James Randi. The JREF's mission includes educating the public and the media on the dangers of accepting unproven claims, and to support research into paranormal claims in controlled scientific experimental conditions.
The organization administers the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, which offers a prize of one million U.S. dollars which it will pay out to anyone who can demonstrate a supernatural or paranormal ability under agreed-upon scientific testing criteria. The JREF also maintains a legal defense fund to assist persons who are attacked as a result of their investigations and criticism of people who make paranormal claims.
The organization is funded through member contributions, grants, and conferences. The JREF website publishes a (nominally daily) blog at randi. JREF Swift Blog

The San Francisco newspaper SF Weekly reported on August 24, 2009 that Randi's annual salary is about $200,000, a figure that has not changed much since the foundation's inception."

The One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge

In 1964, Randi began offering a  prize of $US1000 to anyone who could demonstrate a paranormal ability under agreed-upon testing conditions.  This prize has since been increased to $US1 million in bonds and is now administered by the JREF as the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge.  Since its inception, more than 1000 people have applied to be tested.  To date no one has either been able to demonstrate their claimed abilities under the testing conditions or have not fulfilled the foundation conditions for taking the test; the prize money still remains to be claimed.
 The Amaz!ng Meeting ==  
Since 2003, the JREF has annually hosted The Amaz!ng Meeting, a gathering of scientists,  skeptics, and atheists. Perennial speakers include Richard Dawkins, Penn & Teller, Phil Plait, Michael Shermer and Adam Savage.

The foundation produces two audio podcasts, For Good Reason Consequence is a biweekly podcast in which regular people share their personal narratives about the negative impact a belief in pseudoscience, superstition, and the paranormal has had on their lives.
The JREF also produces a regular video cast and YouTube show, The Randi Show, in which JREF outreach coordinator Brian Thompson interviews Randi on a variety of skeptical topics, often with lighthearted or comedic commentary.

There are free lectures by Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Carol Tavris, Lawrence Krauss, live tests of the Million Dollar Challenge, workshops on cold reading by Ray Hyman, and panels featuring leading thinking on various topics related to JREF's educational mission.
