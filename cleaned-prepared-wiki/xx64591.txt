[[Oceania Football Confederation]]

CATEGORIES: Oceania Football Confederation, Sports governing bodies in Oceania

The Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) is one of the six continental confederations of international association football, consisting of New Zealand and island nations such as Tonga, Fiji and other Pacific Island countries. It promotes the game in Oceania and allows the member nations to qualify for the FIFA World Cup.
Of the six worldwide confederations, the OFC is by far the smallest and is predominantly made up of island nations where football is not the most popular sport. Consequently, the OFC has little influence in the wider football world, either in terms of international competition or as a source of players for high-profile club competitions. In 2006, the OFC's largest and most successful nation, Australia, left to join the Asian Football Confederation, leaving New Zealand as the largest federation within the OFC.
David Chung is the current President of OFC. Martin Alufurai is the Senior Vice President, Lee Harmon is the Vice President while Tai Nicholas is the General Secretary.OFC Executive committee

Member nations

OFC is made up of 11 full member associations and 3 associate members.
1. Associate member of the OFC, but non-FIFA member.

History

The confederation formed in 1966 with the following as founding members:
In 1996 FIFA confirmed the OFC as a full confederation and granted it a seat on the FIFA executive. In 1998 the OFC unveiled a new logo and an official magazine, entitled The Wave. On May 24, 2004 New Caledonia became the 11th member of the OFC. On January 1, 2006, Australia left the OFC and joined the Asian Football Confederation. In 2008 an associate member, the Northern Mariana Islands Football Association, also left OFC and in 2009 joined AFC as a quasi-member. In late 2009 Palau Soccer Association also applied for the same status with AFC.eaff.html

Competitions

The winner of the OFC Football World Cup Qualifiers was allowed to compete in a two-legged home-and-away playoff with the team ranked fifth in the South American qualifying competition for a place in the 2006 World Cup. Since 1996, OFC members also play for the OFC Nations Cup, which is held every second year.
The OFC also organises the Oceania Club Championship, a competition that has received surprisingly high levels of media support within New Zealand in its debut season. It serves primarily to determine the Oceania representative at the FIFA Club World Cup. In 2007, the OFC replaced the current club competition with the OFC Champions League which began in 2007. From 2007, the winner has no longer gained direct entry to the FIFA Club World Cup - but instead plays off against the host nation (currently Morocco) champion for the final spot in the tournament. It is not clear whether this is permanent, or even if it could change if the Oceania entrant were to outperform entrants from other Confederations.
Of the federation's current teams, only New Zealand has ever competed on the world stage from the confederation, competing in the 1982 and 2010 World Cups. Founding member Australia also competed in the World Cup finals, in 1974, 2006. At the conclusion of Germany 2006, Australia's exit from the OFC was finalised (exiting formally on the 1 January 2006), being the last commitment of the transition before completely joining the Asian Football Confederation. The other minor exception to this has been the participation of the Solomon Islands in the 2006, 2007 and 2008 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.  The winner of the OFC Cup also receives a birth in the FIFA Confederations Cup.  New Zealand and Tahiti are the only current members of the OFC to have participated in this event.
In the 2004 OFC Nations Cup, which doubled as the Oceania qualifying tournament for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Solomon Islands unexpectedly made the finals after a 2–2 draw with Australia at the last round. This effectively denied New Zealand a place in the third group phase by one group point as Vanuatu had beaten New Zealand 4–2 in an early round upset of the second group phase. Australia won OFC Nation Cup final by beating the Solomons 5–1 in Honiara and 6–0 in Sydney to represent OFC in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup in Germany. The two teams met again in a two-legged World Cup qualifying final in September 2005 for the right to play the OFC representative for a place in the World Cup finals; Australia won 9–1 on aggregate (7–0 at home and 2–1 away) and progressed to the CONMEBOL – OFC play-off. Australia won this playoff on penalties after a 1–1 aggregate score after both legs of the playoff and after extra time, and qualified for the World Cup.

FIFA World Cup Qualifiers

Oceania has sent representatives to the Men's World Cup four times: Australia in 1974 and 2006, and New Zealand in 1982 and 2010. However, Australia was not a member of the confederation in 1974, having withdrawn in order to apply to join the Asian Football Confederation. It rejoined the OFC in 1978. Neither Australia in 1974 nor New Zealand in 1982 progressed beyond the first round, while Australia in 2006 advanced to the second round. OFC is the only FIFA confederation that does not have a guaranteed spot in the World Cup finals (a major reason for Australia's leaving the confederation in 2006 to join Asia). Between 1966 and 1982, OFC teams joined the Asian zone qualification tournament, while from 1986 onwards, the winners of the Oceanian zone qualification tournament have to enter the Intercontinental Play-offs against teams from other confederations in order to gain a spot in the FIFA World Cup finals.
