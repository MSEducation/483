History

The township was named in 1822 after a pet dog of Lady Sarah Maitland (1792â€“1873), wife of Sir Peregrine Maitland, Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. Two other adjoining townships were also named for her pet dogs, Tay and Flos (now Springwater Township).345
The history of Tiny Township reflects its three founding cultures: Huron,  French and British. It is located within Wendake, the historical homeland of the Huron people. The region was the site of early French missionary exploration, and related sites include the Jesuit mission of Sainte-Marie among the Hurons in present-day Midland. The township is also the location of an important archaeological site, the 17th-century ossuary of the community of Ossossane, the capital of the Huron Confederacy. In 1636 it was the site of a major Huron Feast of the Dead.
In 1798, the British government purchased the land in the area and soon after established a naval base at Penetanguishene. By the mid-19th century, families from Quebec began moving to the Tiny Township area for the cheap and fertile land to farm. The Baldwin Act of 1850 established the Corporation of the United Townships of Tiny and Tay. In 1868, the townships were separated through a Simcoe County by-law.

Demographics

While the regular population is fairly small, the region is a popular summer destination both for tourism and cottagers, increasing the township's population to approximately 27,000.
Tiny Township area is still very much a bilingual (French and English) area of Ontario, and is one of 25 municipalities in Ontario designated for bilingual government services under the French Language Services Act.
