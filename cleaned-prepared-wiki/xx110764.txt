La Stampa. 29 October 1975.

Calabresi was later killed by two shots from a revolver outside his home in 1972."Assassinato per strada il commissario Calabresi". La Stampa. 17 May 1972. In 1988, former Lotta Continua leader Adriano Sofri was arrested with Ovidio Bompressi and Giorgio Pietrostefani for Calabresi's murder. The charges against them were based on testimony provided, 16 years later, by Leonardo Marino, an ex-militant who confessed to the murder of Calabresi, under order from Adriano Sofri. Claiming his innocence, Sofri was finally convicted after a highly contentious trial, in 1997.
