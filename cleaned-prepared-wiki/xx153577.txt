After opening in 1928, the school had its first graduating class of 27 students in June 1930. Through the 1940s, the school's enrollment varied between 150 and 200.

In the 2000s, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Camden explored possibilities to move the school to Gloucester County, New Jersey. After a two-year study the diocese promoted the idea of moving the school to Deptford Township. Due to legal disputes, in 2005 the diocese announced that it would not build a new school in Deptford Township. Andrew Walton, the spokesperson for the diocese, said that the diocese would either renovate and/or expand the existing Gloucester Catholic or move it elsewhere. Walton added that the district would likely not take both actions at the same time. and Terry Bitman.

"Spokesman Andrew Walton said the diocese would also consider renovating and expanding Gloucester Catholic High School in Gloucester City instead of building a new school.

The new campus would be the first Catholic high school campus built in around 40 years. Walton said in 2008 that 60% of the families with children in the school live in Gloucester County.
