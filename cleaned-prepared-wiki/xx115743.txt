Thomas Round at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 4 April 2003, accessed 5 July 2010  During this time he began his performing career, later recalling, "I was doing a lot of singing every Sunday in churches all over Texas.  I had my own plane so I would fly down 300 miles to San Antonio for an 11 a.m. service, I would sing and then I would fly back home in the evening."  He was offered the chance to appear as a guest in a college production in Dallas, playing Canio in I Pagliacci.  "It was my first time in any type of production but I loved it." Round was offered a place at a music school in New York, but turned it down in order to return home to England.
