Beltway 8 (BW8), the Sam Houston Parkway, along with the Sam Houston Tollway, is an  beltway around the city of Houston, Texas, United States, lying entirely within Harris County."Final section of Sam Houston Tollway opens." KTRK-TV. February 26, 2011.
Beltway 8, a state highway, runs mostly along the frontage roads of the tollway, only using the main lanes where they are free between Interstate Highway 45 (North Freeway) and Interstate Highway 69/U.S. 59 (Eastex Freeway). The main lanes elsewhere are the Sam Houston Tollway, a toll road owned and operated by the Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA). East of Houston, the Tollway crosses the Houston Ship Channel on the Sam Houston Ship Channel Bridge, a toll bridge; this forms a gap in Beltway 8 between Interstate Highway 10 (Baytown-East Freeway) and State Highway 225 (La Porte Freeway).
Beltway 8 is the intermediate beltway in the Houston area. The inner beltway - Interstate Highway 610 - lies mostly within Houston (except for an approximate two mile (3 km) stretch that runs through the City of Bellaire), and the outer beltway — State Highway 99 (Grand Parkway) — is not complete.
Like other toll roads in the Houston area, the speed limit is .

Route description

Portions of the West Belt, as sections of the Beltway are called by their compass names, are in various stages of expansion due to high traffic volumes.

Free sections

The longest free section of main lanes is on the north side of Houston, stretching from Ella Boulevard east to Mesa Dr. This is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation east of roughly the Hardy Toll Road interchange.
Three shorter free sections also exist:
These all exist in order to allow federal funding to have been used to build the freeway-to-freeway interchanges at the Baytown-East, Gulf and Southwest Freeways.
The frontage roads are generally continuous, and allow for slower free travel along the tolled segments. Only one break exists in the frontage roads; there are also several locations where one must turn to stay on them:

Lane configuration

The lane count is for mainlanes only, unless otherwise noted.  Starting at the north end of the Sam Houston Ship Channel Bridge, and moving in a clockwise direction, mainlane counts are as follows:

Enforcement

A number of cameras are located at toll booths to record license plate information to a database and send a ticket via mail. Recently, this system has been upgraded to alert local authorities if a vehicle has been flagged for any reason, including Amber Alerts.  When a flagged vehicle is detected, it notifies the closest law enforcement officer to investigate.  At this time, Precinct 5 Constables and Harris County Sheriff's Office are being notified, but Houston Police Department has shown interest and wishes to be included to be notified. The total number of cameras that are planned for the system is 35.Toll road cameras looking beyond scofflaw drivers

History

Houston, known for its fast population growth, began planning for a second beltway in the 1950s (the first was the 610 Loop, created between the 1950s and the 1970s). The Tollway's construction was piecemealed from the opening of the West Belt, a surface street, in the mid-1970s to the completion of the South Belt in the mid-1990s. The Jesse H. Jones Memorial Bridge, the Tollway's crossing of the Houston Ship Channel, was constructed by the then-Texas Turnpike Authority (TTA) and was opened in 1982.
The TTA, however, turned down the opportunity to improve the entire Beltway as well, leaving Harris County to upgrade the road to freeway standards. However, Harris County could not afford to build and maintain a freeway from its general fund.
In September 1983, county voters approved a referendum by a 7-3 margin to release up to $900 million in bonds to create two toll roads, the Hardy Toll Road (basically a reliever for I-45 between downtown Houston and Montgomery County) and the Sam Houston Tollway, which would be the main lanes of the Beltway. Shortly after the referendum, the Harris County Commissioners Court created the HCTRA to administer the construction and operation of the new road system. Then-County Judge Jon Lindsay is generally credited with shepherding the referendum from its infancy to its passage, along with the implementation of the plan for the roadway.
In 1989 the The Bangles performed at the opening of the segment of Beltway 8 between Interstate 10 (Katy Freeway) and U.S. Route 290.R. "What does the Sam Houston Tollway have to do with the Bangles?" Houston Chronicle. February 25, 2011. On Saturday July 7, 1990, a ceremony, called Road Party II, took place for the opening of the section of Beltway 8 between Interstate 45 (North Freeway) and Highway 290, the final segment. Organizers had planned for a crowd of 100,000. KLOL, a radio station, sponsored the event. Jerry Lightfoot & The Essential Band did the opening 80 minute set. "Roadshow/Huey Lewis offers driving rock at party for tollway opening." Houston Chronicle. Monday July 9, 1990. Houston Section, Page 1. The band Huey Lewis and the News performed at the ceremony. The 290-45 segment opened on Sunday July 8, 1990. The project was on schedule and $133 million in 1990 U.S. dollars under budget.
Despite recent speculation about the possibility of the Sam Houston Tollway being sold by HCTRA to a private firm, the Harris County Commissioners Court unanimously voted to keep the tollway in the hands of HCTRA. Bill Murphy, Houston Chronicle.  June 21, 2006.  Last accessed November 9, 2006.
On September 3, 2007 the toll increased by $0.25 system wide with some exceptions.
On February 26, 2011, construction of the main lanes between Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59 (Eastex Freeway) and U.S. Highway 90 (Crosby Freeway) was completed, thus completing the entire Beltway system. Mike Morris, Houston Chronicle. February 21, 2011. Last accessed February 21, 2011. This section was originally set to be completed between 2007 and 2009, but funding issues delayed its completion. Rad Sallee, Houston Chronicle. June 5, 2006.  Last accessed November 9, 2006.  The project cost $400 million and was completed ahead of schedule and under budget. Houston Chronicle. February 16, 2011. Last accessed February 26, 2011. The new  section has three lanes in each direction, and an EZ Tag or TxTag will be required to access it. Almost 60 years had passed between the planning of Beltway 8 and the opening of the final section.
