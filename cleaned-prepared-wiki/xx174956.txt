U.S. Route 82 (US 82) is a U.S. highway that travels from a point just north of Alamogordo, New Mexico to a point southwest of Brunswick, Georgia. In the U.S. state of Georgia, it runs from the Chattahoochee River at Georgetown to its eastern terminus southwest of Brunswick. It passes through such cities as Albany, Tifton, and Waycross, before reaching its eastern terminus.

Route description

Georgetown to Albany

US 82 begins at the Alabama state line concurrent with SR 50. On the Alabama side of the state line, US 82 is concurrent with Alabama State Route 6. On the Georgia side of the state line, US 82/SR 50 head east through Georgetown to an intersection with SR 27/SR 39, where SR 39 begins a concurrency to the southeast. The three highways head southeast until SR 39 splits off to the south. US 82/SR 50 continue to the southeast until they reach an intersection with SR 266, just before entering Cuthbert. In the town, they intersect SR 216. On the east side of town is US 27/SR 1. On the extreme northern edge of Shellman is an intersection with SR 41. Here, they begin a brief concurrency. Just past Graves, SR 45 begins a concurrency until the three routes enter Dawson. In Dawson, there is an intersection with SR 520, where the concurrency with SR 45 ends and the concurrency with SR 520 begins. A short distance later is an intersection with SR 55. The two highways head southeast until they reach Albany.

Albany to Tifton

At the beginning of Albany, the two highways become a freeway known as Liberty Expressway. At the intersection with US 19/SR 3, which join the concurrency, US 19 Business/US 82 Business/SR 520 Business head south into downtown Albany. At the next exit is SR 91/SR 133. SR 133 joins the concurrency at this point. The five highways curve to the south, where US 82/SR 520 head east along with SR 300. Here, US 19/SR 3/SR 133/SR 300 continue south on the expressway. Just east of Albany, SR 300 leaves the concurrency to the northeast. US 82/SR 520 then intersect US 82 Business/SR 520 Business, where they both meet their eastern terminus. The concurrency heads to Sylvester. There, they meet SR 313, SR 33, and SR 112. The two routes continue easterly to Tifton.

Tifton to Waycross

Just after entering Tifton, the two routes meet I-75, before intersecting US 319/SR 35. The two highways join the concurrency for about  after the beginning of the US 1/US 23/SR 4 concurrency is SR 122. Then, the concurrency enters Waycross.

Waycross to eastern terminus

In Waycross, the concurrency meets US 84/SR 38, which join for about  later, US 82/SR 520 meet the western terminus of SR 99. Then, they have an intersection with US 17/SR 25, along with SR 303. This intersection marks the eastern terminus of US 82, while US 17/SR 25/SR 520 head southeast until SR 520 splits to the southeast, along Jekyll Island Causeway, while US 17/SR 25 head north to Brunswick. SR 520 crosses the Jekyll River onto Jekyll Island and terminates at Beach View Drive.

National Highway System

All of US 82 in Georgia from Dawson east to its eastern terminus is part of the National Highway System (NHS), a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense.

History

Prior to designation

The roadway that would eventually become US 82's routing in Georgia was established in 1920 as SR 32 from Cuthbert to Sylvester and SR 46 from Sylvester to Tifton. In 1921, SR 50 was established along a route from US 82's current western terminus in the west, to at least as far as Waynesville, at an intersection with SR 27, in the east. All of SR 50 was eventually utilized by US 82. In 1948, US 82 entered the state, running concurrent with SR 50 only as far east as Waycross. In addition, SR 50 was extended, and paved, east to Jekyll Island.

After designation

In 1988, SR 520 was designated along its entire current length, with SR 50 from Dawson to Jekyll Island being decommissioned.

Major intersections

Bannered route

U.S. Route 82 Business (US 82 Business) is a business loop of US 82 that exists almost entirely within Albany. It follows North Slappey Boulevard and East Oglethorpe Boulevard through the city, and Sylvester Road east of the city. US 82 Business runs entirely concurrent with SR 520 Business; it also has a concurrency with US 19 Business and a brief concurrency with SR 234.
