Józef Kazimierz Korwin Kossakowski (16 March 1738 – 9 May 1794), of Ślepowron Coat of Arms, was a Polish noble (szlachcic), bishop of Livonia from 1781, political activist, writer, and supporter of Russian Empire.

Early life

Brother of hetman Szymon Kossakowski, voivode Michał Kossakowski and castellan Antoni Kossakowski, he took Holy Orders on 17 April 1763Hierarchia Catholica medii et recentioris aevi, v. VI, Patavii 1958, p. 165  after having studied in Vilnius and Warsaw. His first positions in the Church were a provost in Wołpa and canon in Vilnius.

Career

On 13 March 1775 he became an aide of the bishop of Vilnius (titular bishop of Cinna), and on 17 September 1781Hierarchia Catholica medii et recentioris aevi, v. VI, Patavii 1958, p. 435  he became the coadjutor bishop of Vilnius with bishop Ignacy Massalski. His bishop nominations were a reward for his service to the Russian Empire: they were controlled by Empress Catherine the Great, not consulted with Rome, and served to both reward Russian supporters and increase the Russian state control over the Church in their dominions.

Supporting Russian Empire

As a vocal supporter and zealous follower of orders from Russian Empire and Empress Catherine the GreatKłoczowski, ibid., Google Prin, p. 187 he was one of the opponents of the Constitution of May 3. Together with his brother Szymon he commanded the forces of pro-Russian Targowica ConfederationDaniel Stone, The Polish-Lithuanian State, 1386-1795, University of Washington Press, 2001, ISBN 0295980931, Google Prin, p. 321 in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, for a time becoming a de facto ruler of the Duchy (with the aid of the Russian Army). In the aftermath of the Polish-Russian War of 1792, at the Grodno Sejm that legalized the Second Partition of Poland, he argued that "If not Russia, if not Prussia, hence what? Would you like to be suspended in vacuum?" 

Imprisonment and execution

In the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising in April 1794, part of the Kościuszko Uprising, Kossakowski was imprisoned by the revolutionaries. A few days before the start of the uprising, Kossakowski suggested that the Russian troops should surround the churches and arrest all known dissidents. Soon afterwards, Jan Kiliński, one of the leaders of the uprising, presented documents found in the archives of the Russian embassy about Kossakowski's being on the Russian payroll. Most of the citizens of Warsaw, whose support was crucial to the uprising, demanded that Kossakowski and others found to be acting on Russia's behalf against the Commonwealth should be executed. Their stance influenced the revolutionary Criminal Court, and Kossakowski, together with Józef Ankwicz (leader of the Permanent Council) and hetmen Piotr Ożarowski and Józef Zabiełło were convicted of treason and sentenced to hanging on 9 May., Google Prin, p. 540
He was succeeded as a bishop of Livonia by his relative, Jan Nepomucen Kossakowski.
