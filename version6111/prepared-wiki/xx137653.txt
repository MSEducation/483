OXO was an American dance-rock band formed in 1983 by Ish 'Angel' Ledesma, the former lead singer of Foxy. He formed the band with guitarist Orlando Nu√±ez, bass player Frank Garcia, and drummer Freddy Alwag. The band's only Top 40 hit was "Whirly Girl," a song about Ish's wife, which, according to Ledesma, was originally titled "Worldly Girl."[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] Despite its one-hit wonder, OXO's success was not to last, and the band broke up a few years later.
Episode 104 of the Showtime series This American Life, based on the long-running PRI radio show, focuses on Frank Garcia and OXO.
