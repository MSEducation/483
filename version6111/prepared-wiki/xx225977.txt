Livingston is a surname with several different origins. The name itself originates in Scotland as a habitational name derived from Livingston in Lothian which was originally named in Middle English Levingston. This place name was originally named after a man named Levin who appears in several 12th century charters. In Ireland (and in some cases Scotland), the name was adopted by Gaelic Ireland royals bearing the Gaelic surnames Ó Duinnshléibhe and Mac Duinnshléibhe. Livingston can also be an Americanized form of the German surname Lowenstein.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ancestry.com/facts/Livingston-family-history.ashx|title=Livingston Name Meaning and History|accessdate=24 February 2009|work=Ancestry.com[/tpl]
