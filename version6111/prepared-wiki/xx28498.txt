[[Oil-tree]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible

Oil-tree - (Isa. 41:19; R.V. marg., "oleaster"), Heb. 'etz shemen, rendered "olive tree" in 1 Kings 6:23, 31, 32, 33 (R.V., "olive wood") and "pine branches" in Neh. 8:15 (R.V., "branches of wild olive"), was some type of tree distinct from the olive.

==Description==

It was probably the oleaster (Elaeagnus angustifolia), which grows abundantly in almost all parts of the Land of Israel, especially about Hebron and Samaria. "It has a fine hard wood", says Tristram, "and yields an inferior oil, but it has no relationship to the olive, which, however, it resembles in general appearance".
