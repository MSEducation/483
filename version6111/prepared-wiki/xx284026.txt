==Motorways==

===Overview===

Cuba counts 8 toll-free expressways named Autopistas, 7 of them centralized in the city of Havana and connected to each other by the Havana Ring Road, with the exception of the motorway to Mariel. The carriageway is divided and the lanes in each direction goes from 2 to 4. Maximum speed limit is 140 km/h. In the Isla de la Juventud, the dual carriageway from Nueva Gerona to La Fe is classified as motorway.
The principal motorways A1 and A4, running from the west to the east of the island and partly unbuilt (most of A1 sections), are the only one numbered and shortened with "A".Source: Mapa de Carreteras de Cuba (Road map of Cuba). Ediciones GEO, Havana 2011 - ISBN 959-7049-21-X As well as the Carretera Central covers the entire island, they are projected to perform the same function as motorways.
The route from Matanzas to Varadero of the Vía Blanca is the only toll road between Cuban motorways. The other autopistas have short routes and runs from Havana to its suburban towns in Artemisa and Mayabeque provinces.
