Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapeutic approach that addresses dysfunctional emotions, maladaptive behaviors and cognitive processes and contents through a number of goal-oriented, explicit systematic procedures. The name refers to  behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, and to therapy based upon a combination of basic behavioral and cognitive principles and research. Most therapists working with patients dealing with anxiety and depression use a blend of cognitive and behavioral therapy. This technique acknowledges that there may be behaviors that cannot be controlled through rational thought. CBT is "problem focused" (undertaken for specific problems) and "action oriented" (therapist tries to assist the client in selecting specific strategies to help address those problems).Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. T., & Wegner, D. M. (2010). Psychology. (2nd ed., p. 600). New York: Worth Pub.
CBT is thought to be effective for the treatment of a variety of conditions, including mood, anxiety, personality, eating, substance abuse, tic, and psychotic disorders. Many CBT treatment programs for specific disorders have been evaluated for efficacy; the health-care trend of evidence-based treatment, where specific treatments for symptom-based diagnoses are recommended, has favored CBT over other approaches such as psychodynamic treatments.[tpl]Cite book |author=Lambert MJ, Bergin AE, Garfield SL  |editor= Lambert MJ |title= Bergin and Garfield's Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavior Change |edition=5th |year=2004 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=New York  |isbn=0-471-37755-4|pages=3–15 |chapter=Introduction and Historical Overview[/tpl]
CBT was primarily developed through an integration of behavior therapy (the term "behavior modification" appears to have been first used by Edward Thorndike) with cognitive psychology research, first by Donald Meichenbaum and several other authors with the label of cognitive behavior modification in the late 1970s. This tradition thereafter merged with earlier work of a few clinicians, labeled as Cognitive Therapy (CT), developed by Aaron Beck, and Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) developed by Albert Ellis.  While rooted in rather different theories, these two traditions have been characterised by a constant reference to experimental research to test  hypotheses, both at clinical and basic level. Common features of CBT procedures are the focus on the "here and now", a directive or guidance role of the therapist, a structuring of the psychotherapy sessions and path, and on alleviating both symptoms and patients' vulnerability.

==Description==

Mainstream cognitive behavioral therapy assumes that changing maladaptive thinking leads to change in affect and behavior, but recent variants emphasize changes in one's relationship to maladaptive thinking rather than changes in thinking itself.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104449 |title=Open, Aware, and Active: Contextual Approaches as an Emerging Trend in the Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies |year=2011 |last1=Hayes |first1=Steven C. |last2=Villatte |first2=Matthieu |last3=Levin |first3=Michael |last4=Hildebrandt |first4=Mikaela |journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology |volume=7 |pages=141–68 |pmid=21219193[/tpl] Therapists or computer-based programs use CBT techniques to help individuals challenge their patterns and beliefs and replace "errors in thinking such as overgeneralizing, magnifying negatives, minimizing positives and catastrophizing" with "more realistic and effective thoughts, thus decreasing emotional distress and self-defeating behavior."  These errors in thinking are known as cognitive distortions. CBT techniques may also be used to help individuals take a more open, mindful, and aware posture toward them so as to diminish their impact. Mainstream CBT helps individuals replace "maladaptive… coping skills, cognitions, emotions and behaviors with more adaptive ones", by challenging an individual's way of thinking and the way that he/she reacts to certain habits or behaviors,[tpl]cite book |author= Kozier B |title= Fundamentals of nursing: concepts, process and practice |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=_0_pRyy9McQC |year= 2008 |publisher= Pearson Education |isbn=978-0-13-197653-5 |page= 187[/tpl] but there is still controversy about the degree to which these traditional cognitive elements account for the effects seen with CBT over and above the earlier behavioral elements such as exposure and skills training.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2006.08.001 |title=Do we need to challenge thoughts in cognitive behavior therapy? |year=2007 |last1=Longmore |first1=Richard J. |last2=Worrell |first2=Michael |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=173–87 |pmid=17157970[/tpl]
Modern forms of CBT include a number of diverse but related techniques such as exposure therapy, stress inoculation training, cognitive processing therapy, cognitive therapy, relaxation training, dialectical behavior therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy.E.

CBT has six phases:
The reconceptualization phase makes up much of the "cognitive" portion of CBT.  A summary of modern CBT approaches is given by Hofmann.[tpl]cite book |author= Hofmann SG |title= An Introduction to Modern CBT.

There are different protocols for delivering cognitive behavioral therapy, with important similarities among them.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2010.04.006 |title=The Empirical Status of the "New Wave" of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy |year=2010 |last1=Hofmann |first1=Stefan G. |last2=Sawyer |first2=Alice T. |last3=Fang |first3=Angela |journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=701–10 |pmid=20599141 |pmc=2898899[/tpl] Use of the term CBT may refer to different interventions, including "self-instructions (e.g. distraction, imagery, motivational self-talk), relaxation and/or biofeedback, development of adaptive coping strategies (e.g. minimizing negative or self-defeating thoughts), changing maladaptive beliefs about pain, and goal setting". Treatment is sometimes manualized, with brief, direct, and time-limited treatments for individual psychological disorders that are specific technique-driven. CBT is used in both individual and group settings, and the techniques are often adapted for self-help applications. Some clinicians and researchers are cognitively oriented (e.g. cognitive restructuring), while others are more behaviorally oriented (e.g. in vivo exposure therapy). Interventions such as imaginal exposure therapy combine both approaches.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Foa |first1=Edna B. |last2=Rothbaum |first2=Barbara O. |last3=Furr |first3=Jami M. |title=Augmenting exposure therapy with other CBT procedures |journal=Psychiatric Annals |volume=33 |issue=1 |date=Jan 2003 |pages=47–53 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2003-04194-004[/tpl]

===Anxiety disorders===

CBT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of adult anxiety disorders.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v69n0415 |title=Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Adult Anxiety Disorders |year=2008 |last1=Hoffman |first1=Stefan G. |last2=Smits |first2=Jasper A.

A basic concept in some CBT treatments used in anxiety disorders is in vivo exposure, a term describing a technique where the patient is gradually exposed to the actual, feared stimulus. The treatment is based on the theory that the fear response has been classically conditioned, and that avoidance of it negatively reinforces and maintains the fear. This "two-factor" model is often credited to O. Hobart Mowrer.[tpl]Cite book |publisher = Wiley |location=New York |author = Mowrer OH |title = Learning theory and behavior |year = 1960 |isbn = 0-88275-127-1[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] Through exposure to the stimulus, this harmful conditioning can be "unlearned" (referred to as extinction and habituation).

===Schizophrenia, psychosis and mood disorders===

Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown as an effective treatment for clinical depression. The American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines (April 2000) indicated that, among psychotherapeutic approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy had the best-documented efficacy for treatment of major depressive disorder.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890423363.50051 |chapter=Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Bipolar Disorder Second Edition |title=APA Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: Comprehensive Guidelines and Guideline Watches |year=2006 |isbn=0-89042-336-9 |volume=1[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] One etiological theory of depression is Aaron T. Beck's cognitive theory of depression. His theory states that depressed people think the way they do because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative schema of the world in childhood and adolescence as an effect of stressful life events, and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations.[tpl]Cite book|author=Neale JM, Davison GC |title= Abnormal psychology |edition= 8th |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |location= New York |year=2001 |page= 247 |isbn=0-471-31811-6 [/tpl]
Beck also described a negative cognitive triad, made up of the negative schemata and cognitive biases of the person, theorizing that depressed individuals make negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and the future. Depressed people, according to this theory, have views such as, "I never do a good job", "It is impossible to have a good day", and "things will never get better." A negative schema helps give rise to the cognitive bias, and the cognitive bias helps fuel the negative schema. This is the negative triad. Beck further proposed that depressed people often have the following cognitive biases: arbitrary inference, selective abstraction, over-generalization, magnification, and minimization. These cognitive biases are quick to make negative, generalized, and personal inferences of the self, thus fueling the negative schema.
In long-term psychoses, CBT is used to complement medication and is adapted to meet individual needs. Interventions particularly related to these conditions include exploring reality testing, changing delusions and hallucinations, examining factors which precipitate relapse, and managing relapses. Several meta-analyses have shown CBT to be effective in schizophrenia,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm114 |title=Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Schizophrenia: Effect Sizes, Clinical Models, and Methodological Rigor |year=2007 |last1=Wykes |first1=T. |last2=Steel |first2=C. |last3=Everitt |first3=B. |last4=Tarrier |first4=N. |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=523–37 |pmid=17962231 |pmc=2632426[/tpl] and the American Psychiatric Association includes CBT in its schizophrenia guideline as an evidence-based treatment. There is also some (limited) evidence of effectiveness for CBT in bipolar disorder and severe depression.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Kingdon |first1=David |last2=Price |first2=Jessica |title=Cognitive-behavioral Therapy in Severe Mental Illness |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=26 |issue=5 |date=April 17, 2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/schizophrenia/content/article/10168/1406055[/tpl]
A 2010 meta-analysis found that no trial employing both blinding and psychological placebo has shown CBT to be effective in either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and that the effect size of CBT was small in major depressive disorder. They also found a lack of evidence to conclude that CBT was effective in preventing relapses in bipolar disorder.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1017/S003329170900590X |title=Cognitive behavioural therapy for major psychiatric disorder: Does it really work?

J. |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=40 |pages=9–24 |pmid=19476688 |issue=1[/tpl] Evidence that severe depression is mitigated by CBT is also lacking, with anti-depressant medications still viewed as significantly more effective than CBT, although success with CBT for depression was observed beginning in the 1990s.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(97)00199-7 |title=A meta-analysis of the effects of cognitive therapy in depressed patients |year=1998 |last1=Gloaguen |first1=Valérie |last2=Cottraux |first2=Jean |last3=Cucherat |first3=Michel |last4=Blackburn |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=49 |pages=59–72 |pmid=9574861 |first4=IM |issue=1[/tpl]
According to Cox, Abramson, Devine, and Hollon (2012), cognitive behavioral therapy can also be used to reduce prejudice towards others. This other-directed prejudice can cause depression in the "others," or in the self when a person becomes part of a group he or she previously had prejudice towards (i.e. deprejudice).[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1177/1745691612455204 |title=Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |year=2012 |last1=Cox |first1=W.

D. |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=427–49[/tpl] "Devine and colleagues (2012) developed a successful Prejudice Perpetrator intervention with many conceptual parallels to CBT.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.06.003 |title=Long-term reduction in implicit race bias: A prejudice habit-breaking intervention |year=2012 |last1=Devine |first1=Patricia G. |last2=Forscher |first2=Patrick S. |last3=Austin |first3=Anthony J. |last4=Cox |first4=William T.L. |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=1267–1278 |pmid=23524616 |pmc=3603687[/tpl] Like CBT, their intervention taught Sources to be aware of their automative thoughts and to intentionally deploy a variety of cognitive techniques against automatic stereotyping."

===With older adults===

CBT is used to help people of all ages, but the therapy should be adjusted based on the age of the patient with whom the therapist is dealing.  Older individuals in particular have certain characteristics that need to be acknowledged and the therapy altered to account for these differences thanks to age.[tpl]cite journal |last=Bienenfeld |first=David |year=2009 |title=Cognitive therapy with older adults |url=http://www.healio.com/psychiatry/journals/psycann/%7B32eb9933-7d29-4539-8e63-0da2e9a2d58e%7D/cognitive-therapy-with-older-adults |journal=Psychiatric Annals |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=828–32 |doi=10.3928/00485713-20090821-02[/tpl]  Some of the challenges to CBT because of age include the following:

==Methods of access==

===Therapist===

A typical CBT programme would consist of face-to-face sessions between patient and therapist, made up of 6-18 sessions of around an hour each with a gap of a 1–3 weeks between sessions. This initial programme might be followed by some booster sessions, for instance after one month and three months.[tpl]cite book |title=Cognitive behavioural therapy for the management of common mental health problems |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/media/878/F7/CBTCommissioningGuide.pdf |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |date=April 2008[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] CBT has also been found to be effective if patient and therapist type in real time to each other over computer links.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61257-5 |title=Therapist-delivered internet psychotherapy for depression in primary care: A randomised controlled trial |year=2009 |last1=Kessler |first1=David |last2=Lewis |first2=Glyn |last3=Kaur |first3=Surinder |last4=Wiles |first4=Nicola |last5=King |first5=Michael |last6=Weich |first6=Scott |last7=Sharp |first7=Debbie J |last8=Araya |first8=Ricardo |last9=Hollinghurst |first9=Sandra |journal=The Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9690 |pages=628–34 |pmid=19700005 |last10=Peters |first10=Tim J[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.109.073080 |title=Cost-effectiveness of therapist-delivered online cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression: Randomised controlled trial |year=2010 |last1=Hollinghurst |first1=S. |last2=Peters |first2=T.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is most closely allied with the scientist–practitioner model in which clinical practice and research is informed by a scientific perspective, clear operationalization of the problem, and an emphasis on measurement, including measuring changes in cognition and behavior and in the attainment of goals. These are often met through "homework" assignments in which the patient and the therapist work together to craft an assignment to complete before the next session. The completion of these assignments – which can be as simple as a person suffering from depression attending some kind of social event – indicates a dedication to treatment compliance and a desire to change. The therapists can then logically gauge the next step of treatment based on how thoroughly the patient completes the assignment. Effective cognitive behavioral therapy is dependent on a therapeutic alliance between the healthcare practitioner and the person seeking assistance.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Unlike many other forms of psychotherapy, the patient is very involved in CBT. For example, an anxious patient may be asked to talk to a stranger as a homework assignment, but if that is too difficult, he or she can work out an easier assignment first. The therapist needs to be flexible and willing to listen to the patient rather than acting as an authority figure.

===Computerized===

Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT) has been described by NICE as a "generic term for delivering CBT via an interactive computer interface delivered by a personal computer, internet, or interactive voice response system",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA97 |title=Depression and anxiety – computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2012-02-04[/tpl] instead of face-to-face with a human therapist. CCBT has potential to improve access to evidence-based therapies, and to overcome the prohibitive costs and lack of availability sometimes associated with retaining a human therapist.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Marks |first1=Isaac M. |last2=Mataix-Cols |first2=David |last3=Kenwright |first3=Mark |last4=Cameron |first4=Rachel |last5=Hirsch |first5=Steven |last6=Gega |first6=Lina |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |pmid=12835245 |doi=10.1192/bjp.02-463 |doi_brokendate=April 26, 2013 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12835245 |year=2003 |title=Pragmatic evaluation of computer-aided self-help for anxiety and depression |volume=183 |pages=57–65[/tpl]
A key issue in CCBT use is low uptake, even when it has been clearly made available and explained. CCBT completion rates and treatment efficacy have been found in some studies to be higher when use of CCBT is prescribed and supported, than when use is in a self-help form without medical professional involvement.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11920-010-0152-4 |title=Computer-Assisted Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy |year=2010 |last1=Spurgeon |first1=Joyce A. |last2=Wright |first2=Jesse H. |journal=Current Psychiatry Reports |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=547–52 |pmid=20872100[/tpl]
A wide range of software products incorporate CCBT, including, for example, products such as Sparx (video game).
In February 2006 NICE recommended that CCBT be made available for use within the NHS across England and Wales for patients presenting with mild-to-moderate depression, rather than immediately opting for antidepressant medication, and CCBT is made available by some health systems.http://www.devonpartnership.nhs.uk/uploads/tx_mocarticles/CCBT_Leaflet.pdf[tpl]full|date=April 2013[/tpl] The 2009 NICE guideline recognized that there are likely to be a number of computerized CBT products that are useful to patients, but removed endorsement of any specific product.[tpl]cite web |url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG91/NICEGuidance/pdf/English |title=CG91 Depression with a chronic physical health problem |date=28 October 2009 |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
A relatively new avenue of research is the combination of artificial intelligence and CCBT. It has been proposed to use modern technology to create CCBT that simulates face-to-face therapy. This might be achieved in cognitive behaviour therapy for a specific disorders using the comprehensive domain knowledge of CBT.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1375/bech.26.4.245 |title=Online CBT I: Bridging the Gap Between Eliza and Modern Online CBT Treatment Packages |year=2009 |last1=Helgadóttir |first1=Fjóla Dögg |last2=Menzies |first2=Ross G |last3=Onslow |first3=Mark |last4=Packman |first4=Ann |last5=O'Brian |first5=Sue |journal=Behaviour Change |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=245–53[/tpl] One area where this has been attempted, is the specific domain area of social anxiety in those who stutter.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1375/bech.26.4.254 |title=Online CBT II: A Phase I Trial of a Standalone, Online CBT Treatment Program for Social Anxiety in Stuttering |year=2009 |last1=Helgadóttir |first1=Fjóla Dögg |last2=Menzies |first2=Ross G |last3=Onslow |first3=Mark |last4=Packman |first4=Ann |last5=O'Brian |first5=Sue |journal=Behaviour Change |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=254–70[/tpl]

===Reading self-help materials===

Enabling patients to read self-help CBT guides has been shown to be effective by some studies.http://www.mindinbexley.org.uk/docs/E-self_help_guide.pdf[tpl]full|date=April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0052735 |title=Guided Self-Help Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Depression in Primary Care: A Randomised Controlled Trial |year=2013 |editor1-last=Andersson |editor1-first=Gerhard |last1=Williams |first1=Christopher |last2=Wilson |first2=Philip |last3=Morrison |first3=Jill |last4=McMahon |first4=Alex |last5=Andrew |first5=Walker |last6=Allan |first6=Lesley |last7=McConnachie |first7=Alex |last8=McNeill |first8=Yvonne |last9=Tansey |first9=Louise |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |pages=e52735 |pmid=23326352 |issue=1 |pmc=3543408[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1192/apt.7.3.233 |title=Use of written cognitive-behavioural therapy self-help materials to treat depression |year=2001 |last1=Williams |first1=C. |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=233–40[/tpl] However one study found a negative effect in patients who tended to ruminate,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2009.09.016 |title=When self-help is no help: Traditional cognitive skills training does not prevent depressive symptoms in people who ruminate |year=2010 |last1=Haeffel |first1=Gerald J. |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=152–7 |pmid=19875102[/tpl] and another meta-analysis found that the benefit was only significant when the self-help was guided (e.g. by a medical professional).[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0033291707000062 |title=What makes self-help interventions effective in the management of depressive symptoms?

==Brief cognitive behavioral therapy==

Brief cognitive behavioral therapy (BCBT) is a form of CBT which has been developed for situations in which there are time constraints on the therapy sessions.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1080/08995605.2012.736325 |title=Brief cognitive behavioral therapy (BCBT) for suicidality in military populations |year=2012 |last1=Rudd |first1=M. David |journal=Military Psychology |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=592–603[/tpl] BCBT takes place over a couple of sessions that can last up to 12 accumulated hours by design. This technique was first implemented and developed on soldiers overseas in active duty by David M. Rudd to prevent suicide.
Breakdown of treatment

==Cognitive emotional behavioral therapy==

Cognitive emotional behavioral therapy (CEBT) is a form of (CBT) developed initially for individuals with eating disorders but now used with a range of problems including anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anger problems. It combines aspect of CBT and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy and aims to improve understanding and tolerance of emotions in order to facilitate the therapeutic process. It is frequently used as a 'pretreatment' to prepare and better equip individuals for longer term therapy.

==Structured cognitive behavioral training==

Structured cognitive behavioral training (SCBT) is a cognitive-based process with core philosophies that draw heavily from CBT. Like CBT, SCBT asserts that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions. SCBT also builds on core CBT philosophy by incorporating other well-known modalities in the fields of behavioral health and psychology: most notably, Albert Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. SCBT differs from CBT in two distinct ways. Firstly, SCBT is delivered in a highly regimented format. Secondly, SCBT is a predetermined and finite training process that becomes personalized by the input of the participant. SCBT is designed with the intention to bring a participant to a specific result in a specific period of time. SCBT has been used to challenge addictive behavior, particularly with substances such as tobacco, alcohol and food; and to manage diabetes and subdue stress and anxiety. SCBT has also been used in the field of criminal psychology in the effort to reduce recidivism.

==Effectiveness==

In adults, CBT has been shown to have effectiveness and a role in the treatment plans for anxiety disorders, depression, eating disorders, chronic low back pain, personality disorders, psychosis, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, in the adjustment, depression, and anxiety associated with fibromyalgia, and with post-spinal cord injuries. Evidence has shown CBT is effective in helping treat schizophrenia, and it is now offered in most treatment guidelines.http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11786/43610/43610.pdf[tpl]full|date=April 2013[/tpl]
In children or adolescents, CBT is an effective part of treatment plans for anxiety disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, depression and suicidality, eating disorders and obesity, obsessive–compulsive disorder,  and posttraumatic stress disorder, as well as tic disorders, trichotillomania, and other repetitive behavior disorders.
Cochrane reviews have found no evidence that CBT is effective for tinnitus, although there appears to be an effect on management of associated depression and quality of life in this condition. Other recent Cochrane Reviews found no convincing evidence that CBT training helps foster care providers manage difficult behaviors in the youth under their care, nor was it helpful in treating men who abuse their intimate partners.
According to a 2004 review by INSERM of three methods, cognitive behavioral therapy was either "proven" or "presumed" to be an effective therapy on several specific mental disorders.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=21348158 |year=2000 |author1=INSERM Collective Expertise Centre |title=Psychotherapy: Three approaches evaluated[/tpl] According to the study, CBT was effective at treating schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress, anxiety disorders, bulimia, anorexia, personality disorders and alcohol dependency.
Some meta-analyses find CBT more effective than psychodynamic therapy and equal to other therapies in treating anxiety and depression.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2010.05.003 |title=Is cognitive–behavioral therapy more effective than other therapies?A meta-analytic review |year=2010 |last1=Tolin |first1=David F. |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=710–20 |pmid=20547435[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0013075 |title=Psychotherapy for depression in adults: A meta-analysis of comparative outcome studies |year=2008 |last1=Cuijpers |first1=Pim |last2=Van Straten |first2=Annemieke |last3=Andersson |first3=Gerhard |last4=Van Oppen |first4=Patricia |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages=909–22 |pmid=19045960[/tpl] However, psychodynamic therapy may provide better long-term outcomes.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0018378 |title=The efficacy of psychodynamic psychotherapy |year=2010 |last1=Shedler |first1=Jonathan |journal=American Psychologist |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=98–109 |pmid=20141265[/tpl]

Criticism of CBT sometimes focuses on implementations (such as the UK IAPT) which may result initially in low quality therapy being offered by poorly trained practitioners.[tpl]cite press release |title=UKCP response to Andy Burnham's speech on mental health |publisher=UK Council for Psychotherapy |date=1 February 2012 |url=http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/article1488.html |accessdate=April 26, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/anxiety-files/201111/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-proven-effectiveness |first=Robert L. |last=Leahy |date=November 23, 2011 |title=Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: Proven Effectiveness |work=Psychology Today[/tpl] However evidence supports the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety and depression.
Mounting evidence suggests that the addition of hypnotherapy as an adjunct to CBT improves treatment efficacy for a variety of clinical issues.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.63.2.214 |title=Hypnosis as an adjunct to cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy: A meta-analysis |year=1995 |last1=Kirsch |first1=Irving |last2=Montgomery |first2=Guy |last3=Sapirstein |first3=Guy |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=214–20 |pmid=7751482[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1080/00207140601177897 |title=Cognitive Hypnotherapy for Depression:An Empirical Investigation |year=2007 |last1=Alladin |first1=Assen |last2=Alibhai |first2=Alisha |journal=International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=147–66 |pmid=17365072[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1080/00029157.2011.654284 |title=Cognitive Hypnotherapy for Pain Management |year=2012 |last1=Elkins |first1=Gary |last2=Johnson |first2=Aimee |last3=Fisher |first3=William |journal=American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=294–310 |pmid=22655332[/tpl]

==Criticisms==

One criticism of CBT theory, especially as applied to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), is that it confounds the symptoms of the disorder with its causes.Berger, D.

A major criticism has been that clinical studies of CBT efficacy (or any psychotherapy) are not double-blind (i.e., neither subjects nor therapists in psychotherapy studies are blind to the type of treatment). They may be single-blinded, i.e. the rater may not know the treatment the patient received, but neither the patients nor the therapists are blinded to the type of therapy given (two out of three of the persons involved in the trial, i.e., all of the persons involved in the treatment, are unblinded). The patient is an active participant in correcting negative distorted thoughts, thus quite aware of the treatment group they are in.
The importance of double-blinding was shown in a meta-analysis that examined the effectiveness of CBT when placebo control and blindedness were factored in.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lynch D, Laws KR, McKenna PJ | year = 2010 | title = Cognitive behavioral therapy for major psychiatric disorder: does it really work?

This study concluded that CBT is no better than non-specific control interventions in the treatment of schizophrenia and does not reduce relapse rates, treatment effects are small in treatment studies of MDD, and it is not an effective treatment strategy for prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder. For MDD, the authors note that the pooled effect size was very low. Nevertheless, the methodological processes used to select the studies in the previously mentioned meta-analysis and the worth of its findings have been called into question.[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=19917145|year=2010|last1=Lincoln|first1=TM|title=Letter to the editor: A comment on Lynch et al.

The element of hope and expectation on the part of the patients to get better in non-blinded trials will bias the results in favor of CBT. The informed consent procedure required to enter a psychotherapy trial biases the subjects who enter to those that are favorably inclined to the psychotherapy. Taken together, trials using psychotherapy do not meet the qualifications of high quality evidence.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sathyanarayana R, Andrade C | year = 2013 | title = Screening for disease, psychologic testing, and psychotherapy: Looking behind the mirror | url = | journal = Indian J Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 103–105 | doi = 10.4103/0019-5545.111446 | pmid = 23825840 | pmc = 3696229 [/tpl]

==History==

===Behavior therapy roots===

Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of CBT have been identified in various ancient philosophical traditions, particularly Stoicism.[tpl]Cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&pg=PR19&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| author=Donald Robertson|page=xix |year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1[/tpl] For example, Aaron T.

Behaviorally-centered therapeutic approaches appeared as early as 1924[tpl]Cite book| author=Rachman, S |editor =Clark, D, Fairburn, CG & Gelder, MG  |title=Science and practice of cognitive behaviour therapy | chapter=The evolution of cognitive behaviour therapy |pages=1–26| year=1997 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford  | isbn=0-19-262726-0 [/tpl] with Mary Cover Jones' work on the unlearning of fears in children.[tpl]Cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0072283 |title=The Elimination of Children's Fears |year=1924 |last1=Jones |first1=M.

It was during the period 1950 to 1970 that behavioral therapy became widely utilized by researchers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, who were inspired by the behaviorist learning theory of Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and Clark L. Hull. In Britain, this work was mostly focused on the neurotic disorders through the work of Joseph Wolpe, who applied the findings of animal experiments to his method of systematic desensitization,[tpl]Cite book|publisher = Stanford University Press |author= Wolpe J |authorlink=Joseph Wolpe |title = Psychotherapy by reciprocal inhibition |year = 1958 |isbn = 0-8047-0509-7[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] the precursor to today's fear reduction techniques.

===Other roots===

Although the early behavioral approaches were successful in many of the neurotic disorders, they had little success in treating depression.  Behaviorism was also losing in popularity due to the so-called "cognitive revolution". The therapeutic approaches of Albert Ellis and Aaron T. Beck gained popularity among behavior therapists, despite the earlier behaviorist rejection of "mentalistic" concepts like thoughts and cognitions.  Both of these systems included behavioral elements and interventions and primarily concentrated on problems in the present. Albert Ellis' system, originated in the early 1950s, was first called rational therapy, and can (arguably) be called one of the first forms of cognitive behavioral therapy. It was partly founded as a reaction against popular psychotherapeutic theories at the time (mainly psychoanalysis).[tpl]Cite book |author= Ellis A |authorlink=Albert Ellis (psychologist) |title= A New Guide to Rational Living |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1975 |isbn=0-13-370650-8 [/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=April 2013[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] Beck describes his therapeutic approach as originating in a realization he made while conducting free association with patients in the context of classical psychoanalysis. He noted that patients had not been reporting certain thoughts at the fringe of consciousness – thoughts which often preceded intense emotional reactions. This realization led Beck to begin viewing emotional reactions as resulting from cognitions, rather than understanding emotion within the abstract psychoanalytic framework.Beck, Aaron T., Prisoners of Hate: The Cognitive Basis of Anger, Hostility, and Violence, Harper Collins, 1999, Introduction.[tpl]page needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] He named these cognitions "automatic thoughts" because he believed that people were not necessarily aware that the cognitions existed, but that they could identify these types of thoughts when questioned closely.[tpl]Unreliable medical source|date=April 2012[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |author=Martin, Ben| title=In-Depth: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy| url= http://psychcentral.com/lib/2007/in-depth-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/all/1/|publisher=PsychCentral |accessdate= March 15, 2012[/tpl] Beck believed that pushing his clients to identify these automatic thoughts was integral to overcoming a particular difficulty.
In initial studies, cognitive therapy was often contrasted with behavioral treatments to see which was most effective. During the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive and behavioral techniques were merged into cognitive behavioral therapy. Pivotal to this merging was the successful development of treatments for panic disorder by David M. Clark in the UK and David H. Barlow in the US.

==Society and culture==

The UK's National Health Service announced in 2008 that more therapists would be trained to provide CBT at government expense as part of an initiative called Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT).[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/sep/09/psychology.humanbehaviour |author= Leader D |title= A quick fix for the soul |date= September 8, 2008 |work= The Guardian |accessdate= April 22, 2012[/tpl] NICE said that CBT would become the mainstay of treatment for non-severe depression, with medication used only in cases where CBT had failed. Therapists complained that the data does not fully support the attention and funding CBT receives. Psychotherapist and professor Andrew Samuels stated that this constitutes "a coup, a power play by a community that has suddenly found itself on the brink of corralling an enormous amount of money ... Everyone has been seduced by CBT's apparent cheapness."[tpl]Cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/the-big-question-can-cognitive-behavioural-therapy-help-people-with-eating-disorders-1128229.html |date= December 16, 2008 |accessdate= April 22, 2012 |title= The big question: can cognitive behavioural gherapy help people with eating disorders? |work= The Independent |author= Laurance J[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2008/july/CBT+superiority+questioned+at+conference |title= CBT superiority questioned at conference | publisher= University of East Anglia |date= July 7, 2008 |accessdate= April 22, 2012[/tpl] The UK Council for Psychotherapy issued a press release in 2012 saying that the IAPT's policies were undermining traditional psychotherapy and criticized proposals that would limit some approved therapies to CBT, claiming that they restricted patients to "a watered down version of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), often delivered by very lightly trained staff".[tpl]cite press release |url= http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/article1488.html |title= UKCP response to Andy Burnham's speech on mental health |date= February 1, 2012 |publisher = UK Council for Psychotherapy |accessdate= April 22, 2012[/tpl]
NICE also recommends offering CBT to all people with schizophrenia.
