Critical Beatdown is the debut studio album by American hip hop group Ultramagnetic MCs, released on October 4, 1988, by Next Plateau Records.Hip-Hop's Greatest Year: Fifteen Albums that Made Rap Explode. Rolling Stone. February 12, 2008. Retrieved on July 27, 2008. Production for the album was handled primarily by the group's rapper and producer Ced-Gee, who employed an E-mu SP-1200 sampler as the album's main instrument. Music journalists have noted the album for its innovative production, funk-based samples, self-assertive themes, ingenious lyricism, and complex rhyme patterns.
Although it charted modestly upon its release, Critical Beatdown has since been acclaimed by critics as a classic album of hip hop's "golden age" and new school aesthetic. The album's abstract rhymes in strange syncopations laid on top of sampling experiments proved widely influential, from Public Enemy to gangsta rap to several generations of underground hip hop artists."Hip Hop's Greatest Albums By Year" in Sacha Jenkins, Elliott Wilson, Chairman Mao, Gabriel Alvarez & Brent Rollins. ego trip's Book of Rap Lists, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999, pp. 331–337.

==Background==

Before forming as a hip hop group, Ultramagnetic MCs members Cedric "Ced-Gee" Miller, "Kool" Keith Thornton, DJ Moe Love (Maurice Smith), and TR Love (Trevor Randolph) from The Bronx, New York were break dancers for the New York City Breakers and People's Choice crews.Shapiro, Peter (2005), p. 374. They recorded a demo, "Space Groove", in 1984 and released their first single "To Give You Love" in 1986. Other singles, including "Space Groove" and "Something Else", became popular at block parties and earned the group notice in the underground music scene, eventually leading to the group's signing with dance-oriented record label Next Plateau Records.Cooper, Sean (November 1, 2001).

The group made a stylistic breakthrough with their subsequent 1986 single "Ego Trippin'". The song boasted dense, minimalist production, featuring synthesizer riffs and a drum sample from Melvin Bliss' "Synthetic Substitution", and erratic lyricism by Ced-Gee and Kool Keith. The group's 1987 single "Funky" showcased Ced-Gee expanding on his production style, incorporating a piano sample from "Woman to Woman" by Joe Cocker. Before the release of Critical Beatdown, he contributed to production on albums such as Paid in Full (1987) by Eric B. & Rakim and Criminal Minded (1987) by Boogie Down Productions.

===Production===

The dynamic, choppy production on Critical Beatdown was handled primarily by Ced-Gee, who used an E-mu SP-1200 sampler.Classic Material (2003), p. 161. His sampling of early recordings by James Brown, particularly their guitar and vocal parts, added to the music's abrasive, funk-oriented sound and exemplified the growing popularity of such sampling sources in hip hop at the time. Along with samples of Brown's music, the production utilized drum breaks from commonly sampled sources such as Melvin Bliss' 1973 song "Synthetic Substitution". In the second edition of The Rough Guide to Hip Hop (2005), music journalist Peter Shapiro notes its music's energy as reminiscent of The Cold Crush Brothers and writes of the album's musical significance, "It may have been a stunning explosion of early sampling technology, but Critical Beatdown remains a devstating album even in an age of 32-bit samplers and RAM-intensive sound-editing software."Shapiro, Peter (2005), p. 375. He also views that the technological limitations of using such a sampler added to the album's style, making the music "rawer, more immediate, and more febrile, like a raw nerve."
Hip hop production team The Bomb Squad has cited the album as a major influence on their production for Public Enemy's 1988 album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. Music journalist Jeff Chang writes that Ced-Gee "pushed sampling technology to its early limits, providing sonics that are less bassy and more breakbeat heavy than most of their contemporaries." Shapiro dubs it one of the greatest hip hop albums and comments on its musical legacy, "Recorded at a time before 'street' and 'experimental' were mutually exclusive terms, it ushered in hip-hop's sampladelic golden age and laid the foundation for several generations of underground rap."Shapiro, Peter (2005), p. 376.

===Lyrics===

Kool Keith's and Ced-Gee's lyrics on the album are characterized by abstract braggadocio,Freeman, Phil (2007), p. 205. stream-of-consciousness narrative style,Cobb, William Jelani (2007), p. 54. and pseudoscientific terminology.The Anthology of Rap (2010), p. 497. The Anthology of Rap, published by Yale University Press, makes note of such terminology in Ced-Gee's lyricism on the album's 1986 single "Ego Trippin'", particularly the lines "Usin' frequencies and data, I am approximate / Leaving revolutions turning, emerging chemistry / With the precise implications, achieved adversively". Kool Keith's rhymes are manic and expressed in a staccato pace. His lyrics on "Ego Trippin'" also criticize the musical aesthetic of old school hip hop artists at the time: "They use the simple back and forth, the same old rhythm / That a baby can pick up and join right with them / But their rhymes are pathetic, they think they copasetic / Using nursery terms, at least not poetic".

==Critical reception==

Allmusic editor Stanton Swihart praised the album's production as "forward-looking" and called it "an undeniable hip-hop classic ... one of the finest rap albums from the mid- to late-'80s 'new school' in hip-hop."Swihart, Stanton (November 1, 2001). Critical Beatdown - Ultramagnetic MC's: Review. Allmusic. Retrieved on July 10, 2011. He noted the "lyrical invention" of Kool Keith's and Ced-Gee's respective styles, adding that "Somewhere in the nexus between the two stylistic extremes, brilliant music emanated. Critical Beatdown maintains all its sharpness and every ounce of its power, and it has not aged one second since 1988." Trouser Press journalist Jeff Chang called it "an amazing debut" and complimented Kool Keith's "shifty rhyme patterns".Jeff Chang (1997). TrouserPress.com :: Ultramagnetic MC's. Trouser Press. Retrieved on July 10, 2011. Pitchfork Media's Alex Linhardt called it "a flawless album—one that stands tall today as one of Golden Age's most ageless," lauding Kool Keith's "lyrical ingenuity" and citing Ced-Gee as "the source of the album's most insane, digitalk-quantum gibberish, spouting lines ... They should be studied in seminars alongside general relativity."Linhardt, Alex (June 10, 2004). Album Reviews: Ultramagnetic MC's: Critical Beatdown. Pitchfork Media. Retrieved on July 10, 2011. Linhardt attributed its music's "surging psychosis" to DJ Moe Love's turntablism and Ced-Gee's dense funk sampling, particularly his arrangement of vocal samples, writing that they "are ingrained in the very fabric of the beat, concealed and crippled amidst the relentlessly fuzzing bass. And like most great rap albums, many of them come from the patron saint of yelps, James Brown, and flurry and flux with such abstraction and chaos that they make the beats feel deceptively fast-paced."
Melody Maker stated in a retrospective review, "full of scratch-tastic heavy beat, gold plated hip hop which manages to combine the minimalist ground-breaking Sugar Hill sounds with the show-no-mercy aural assault of the then-emerging Public Enemy."[tpl]cite journal |author=Columnist |date=October 18, 1997 |title=Review: Ultramagnetic MCs, Critical Beatdown |journal=Melody Maker |volume= |issue= |page=53 |publisher=IPC Media [/tpl] NME called it "a bona fide classic."[tpl]cite journal |author=Columnist |date=October 4, 1997 |title=Review: Ultramagnetic MCs, Critical Beatdown |journal=NME |page=55 |publisher=IPC Media [/tpl] Sputnikmusic's Louis Arp noted the group's sound as "developed solely around the sampler" and stated, "Critical Beatdown[tpl]'[/tpl]s notoriety as one of hip-hop's first copyright offenders is more than slightly impressive ... Those grooves, the lyrics and the all around unique feel of the album make for some innovating hip-hop."Arp, Louis (June 29, 2006). Ultramagnetic MCs - Critical Beatdown (album review). Sputnikmusic. Retrieved on July 10, 2011. Arp commented that the album "marks a sign of hip-hop's early burgeoning creative maturity" and praised Ced-Gee's "method of chopping up samples, rather than simply looping them like most of his contemporaries did, essentially changed the way the producer approached the hip-hop beat". Rolling Stone writer Peter Relic cited it as the group's "quintessential release."[tpl]cite journal|last=Relic|first=Pete|date=June 24, 2004|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tEuxVHI7|archivedate=2010-10-04|title=Ultramagnetic MC's: Critical Beatdown |journal=Rolling Stone|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071023084349/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/5231062/review/6098706/criticalbeatdown|accessdate=2011-07-10[/tpl] Colin Larkin, writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, said that it "served as a direct influence on the 'Daisy Age' rap of subsequent acts such as De La Soul and PM Dawn", while singles such as "Give the Drummer Some" showed the Ultramagnetic MC's "in their best light: call and response raps demonstrating individual members self-espoused talent in the best traditions of the old school."[tpl]sfn|Larkin|2006|p=342[/tpl] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), journalist Kembrew McLeod called the album "a bona fide classic of hip-hop's 'golden age' of the late '80s and early '90s, an album that was mostly ignored at the time but whose reputation has grown exponentially in the years since."Rolling Stone (2004), p. 836.
