==Biography==

The son of Charles de La Porte (called "Marshal de La Meilleraye") and nephew of Cardinal Richelieu, Armand-Charles was marquis de La Porte. He later became marquis de La Meilleraye and then duc de Mayenne. He served as Grand Master of the French Artillery in 1646 or 1648.
On 1 March 1661 he married Hortense Mancini, the favourite niece and heiress of the immensely wealthy Cardinal Mazarin. Upon his marriage, he became duc Mazarin. In addition, he was made a French peer, duc de La Meilleraye, prince de Château-Porcien, marquis de Montcornet, as well as comte de La Fère and de Marle.
The duke and his wife had four children:
The marriage proved quite unhappy due to the duke's mistreatment of his wife, and in 1668 Hortense fled from France, in order to escape her abusive husband. She eventually settled in England, where she became a mistress of King Charles II.
He died at Meilleray in 1713.
