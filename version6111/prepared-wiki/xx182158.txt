The Laurel Railroad Station was originally constructed in 1884, for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.  The architect was E. Francis Baldwin.  The structure is constructed of brick, and is one and a half stories, modified rectangle in form with overhanging gabled and hipped roof sections with brackets and terra cotta cresting, and an interior chimney.  There is a louvered lunette in one gable, stick work in another, and fish-scale shingling under truncated hipped section; shed shelter, segmental arched openings. It is Queen Anne in style.[ref]
