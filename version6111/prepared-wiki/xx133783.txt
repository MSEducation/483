Norethisterone (or norethindrone) (or 19-nor-17α-ethynyltestosterone) is a molecule used in some combined oral contraceptive pills, progestogen only pills and is also available as a stand-alone drug. It is a progestogen and can be used to treat premenstrual syndrome, painful periods, abnormal heavy bleeding, irregular periods, menopausal syndrome (in combination with oestrogen), or to postpone a period. It is also commonly used to help prevent uterine hemorrhage in complicated non-surgical or pre-surgical gynecologic cases.  Norethindrone was the first orally highly active progestin to be synthesized.  It was synthesized for the first time by chemists Luis Miramontes, Carl Djerassi, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City in 1951.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Djerassi | first1 = C. | authorlink1 = Carl Djerassi | last2 = Miramontes | first2 = L. | authorlink2 = Luis E.

Its related ester, norethisterone acetate, is used for the same indications.
