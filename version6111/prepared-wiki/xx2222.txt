Neuropathology. By Dimitri Agamanolis, Northeast Ohio Medical University . Updated: May, 2011 In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4–7.3 mmHg or 0.78–0.98 kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the cerebrospinal fluid as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the intracranial pressure.
There are quantitative differences in the distributions of a number of proteins in the CSF. In general, globular proteins and albumin are in lower concentration in ventricular CSF compared to lumbar or cisternal fluid.[tpl]cite journal |author=Merril CR, Goldman D, Sedman SA, Ebert MH |title=Ultrasensitive stain for proteins in polyacrylamide gels shows regional variation in cerebrospinal fluid proteins |journal=Science |volume=211 |issue= 4489|pages=1437–8 |date=March 1981 |pmid=6162199 |doi= 10.1126/science.6162199|url=[/tpl] [tpl]anchor|IgG index[/tpl]The IgG index of cerebrospinal fluid is a measure of the immunoglobulin G content, and is elevated in multiple sclerosis.

===Development===

Around the third week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc. The embryo is covered on the dorsal surface by a layer of cells called endoderm. In the middle of the dorsal surface of the embryo is a linear structure called the notochord. As the endoderm proliferates, the notochord is dragged into the middle of the developing embryo. The notochord becomes a canal within the embryo known as the neural canal.
As the brain develops, by the fourth week of embryological development several swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system, and are three in number: the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon.
The developing forebrain surrounds the neural cord. As the forebrain develops, the neural cord within it becomes a ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral ventricles. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a choroid plexus develops, releasing CSF. The CSF quickly fills the neural canal.[tpl]cite book|first=Gary C.

==Function==

CSF serves four primary purposes:

[/ref] The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows the brain to maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.

==Clinical significance==

When CSF pressure is elevated, cerebral blood flow may be constricted. When disorders of CSF flow occur, they may therefore affect not only CSF movement but also craniospinal compliance and the intracranial blood flow, with subsequent neuronal and glial vulnerabilities. The venous system is also important in this equation. Infants and patients shunted as small children may have particularly unexpected relationships between pressure and ventricular size, possibly due in part to venous pressure dynamics. This may have significant treatment implications, but the underlying pathophysiology needs to be further explored.
CSF connections with the lymphatic system have been demonstrated in several mammalian systems. Preliminary data suggest that these CSF-lymph connections form around the time that the CSF secretory capacity of the choroid plexus is developing (in utero). There may be some relationship between CSF disorders, including hydrocephalus and impaired CSF lymphatic transport.

===Lumbar puncture===

CSF can be tested for the diagnosis of a variety of neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture.[tpl]cite journal |author=Seehusen DA, Reeves MM, Fomin DA |title=CSF analysis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=1103–8 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14524396 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030915/1103.html[/tpl]
Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. Cells in the fluid are counted, as are the levels of protein and glucose. These parameters alone may be extremely beneficial in the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage and central nervous system infections (such as meningitis). Moreover, a CSF culture examination may yield the microorganism that has caused the infection. By using more sophisticated methods, such as the detection of the oligoclonal bands, an ongoing inflammatory condition (for example, multiple sclerosis) can be recognized. A beta-2 transferrin assay is highly specific and sensitive for the detection for, e.g., CSF leakage.[tpl]cite book|first=the editors Nicki R. Colledge, Brian R. Walker, Stuart H.

Lumbar puncture can also be performed to measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of hydrocephalus. However a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because it can lead to brain herniation and ultimately death.[tpl]rp|1147–1148[/tpl]
About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture.[tpl]rp|1147–1148[/tpl]

===Baricity===

This fluid has an importance in anesthesiology.  Baricity refers to the density of a substance compared to the density of human cerebrospinal fluid. Baricity is used in anesthesia to determine the manner in which a particular drug will spread in the intrathecal space.

===Alzheimer's disease===

A 2010 study showed analysis of CSF for three protein biomarkers can indicate the presence of Alzheimer's disease. The three biomarkers are CSF amyloid beta 1-42, total CSF tau protein and P-Tau181P. In the study, the biomarker test showed good sensitivity, identifying 90% of persons with Alzheimer's disease, but poor specificity, as 36% of control subjects were positive for the biomarkers. The researchers suggested the low specificity may be explained by developing but not yet symptomatic disease in controls.[tpl]cite journal |title= Diagnosis-Independent Alzheimer Disease Biomarker Signature in Cognitively Normal Elderly People |url= http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/67/8/949 |journal= Archive of Neurology  |last= De Meyer |first= Geert |date= August 2010 |pages= 949–56 |volume= 67 |pmid= 20697045 |issue= 8 |doi= 10.1001/archneurol.2010.179 |accessdate= 2010-09-08 |pmc=2963067 |display-authors= 1 |last2= Shapiro |first2= F. |last3= Vanderstichele |first3= H. |last4= Vanmechelen |first4= E. |last5= Engelborghs |first5= S. |last6= De Deyn |first6= P.

==History==

Various comments by ancient physicians have been read as referring to CSF. Hippocrates discussed "water" surrounding the brain when describing congenital hydrocephalus, and Galen referred to "excremental liquid" in the ventricles of the brain, which he believed was purged into the nose.  But for some 16 intervening centuries of ongoing anatomical study, CSF remains unmentioned in the literature. This is perhaps because of the prevailing autopsy technique, which involved cutting off the head, thereby removing evidence of the CSF before the brain was examined.  The modern rediscovery of CSF is now credited to Emanuel Swedenborg. In a manuscript written between 1741 and 1744, unpublished in his lifetime, Swedenborg referred to CSF as "spirituous lymph" secreted from the roof of the fourth ventricle down to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. This manuscript was eventually published in translation in 1887.[tpl]Cite journal | last =Hajdu | first =Steven I. | year = 2003 | title = A Note from History: Discovery of the Cerebrospinal Fluid | journal =Annals of Clinical and Laboratory Science| volume = 33, number 3 | pages = 334–6 | doi = | url = http://www.annclinlabsci.org/content/33/3/334.full.pdf | pmid = 12956452 | issue =3 [/tpl]
Albrecht von Haller, a Swiss physician and physiologist, Avery Kinsey, made note in his 1747 book on physiology that the "water" in the brain was secreted into the ventricles and absorbed in the veins, and when secreted in excess, could lead to hydrocephalus.
Francois Magendie studied the properties of CSF by vivisection. He discovered the foramen Magendie, the opening in the roof of the fourth ventricle, but mistakenly believed that CSF was secreted by the pia mater.
Thomas Willis (noted as the discoverer of the circle of Willis) made note of the fact that the consistency of the CSF is altered in meningitis.
In 1891, W. Essex Wynter began treating tubercular meningitis by tapping the subarachnoid space, and Heinrich Quincke began to popularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In 19th and early 20th century literature, particularly German medical literature, liquor cerebrospinalis was a term used to refer to CSF.
In 1912, William Mestrezat gave the first accurate description of the chemical composition of the CSF. In 1914, Harvey W. Cushing published conclusive evidence that the CSF is secreted by the choroid plexus.
