The KAB-500L is a laser-guided bomb developed by the Soviet Air Force. It remains in service with the CIS and post-Soviet Russian Air Force.
The KAB-500L is analogous to the U.S. Paveway series: it is a standard FAB-500 general-purpose bomb, which has a nominal weight of [tpl]convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], fitted with a semi-active laser seeker and guidance fins, turning it into a guided, unpowered glide bomb.
The KAB-500L is [tpl]convert|3.05|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long and weighs [tpl]convert|525|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. Its warhead makes up [tpl]convert|450|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] of the total weight, of which roughly 50% is blast-effect high explosive. Russian sources credit it with a CEP of [tpl]convert|7|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl].
It is also deployed by the Indian Air Force. The primary launch platform is Su-30MKI.

==LT-2==

The Chinese LT-2 LGB bears many similarities to the Russian KAB-500L. It is probable that the LT-2 incorporated some technologies reverse-engineered from the KAB-500L.http://mil.jschina.com.cn/huitong/missile1.htm  However, at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow held at in November, 2008, the developer of the LT series revealed that LT series precision guided bombs are actually based on the American Paveway design.
