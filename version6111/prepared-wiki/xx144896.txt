[[Air shower (room)]]

CATEGORIES: Filters, Rooms

Air showers are specialised antechambers which personnel need to pass through before entering cleanrooms in order to decontaminate. Decontamination is done by clearing off dust and dirt particles from bodies of cleanroom personnel to minimize contamination of equipment or products.
Designs to an air shower unit include single-side shower, double-side shower, three-side shower, and top shower. Spraying wind speed is around 25 m/s or above through stainless steel nozzles. HEPA filters are generally used to filter out particles greater than 0.3 micrometres in size from the shower air.
In fields where sterile or dust-free conditions are critical - for example, life science and biomedical research, pharmaceutical, parenteral drug, microelectronics, aerospace and precision manufacturing — air showers are considered essential equipment.

==Purpose==

Due to the requirement of dust-free conditions in cleanrooms, air showers are used to decontaminate by blasting dirt and dust particles off personnel entering the cleanroom. The pollutants carried by personnel can affect factory equipment.
