The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/docs/ccmanual.pdf |title=Prosecution of Computer Crimes |last1=Jarrett |first1=H. Marshall |last2=Bailie |first2=Michael W. |date=2010 |website=justice.gov |publisher=Office of Legal Education Executive Office for United States Attorneys |accessdate=June 3, 2013[/tpl] was enacted by Congress in 1986 as an amendment to existing computer fraud law ([tpl]USC|18|1030[/tpl]), which had been included in the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. It was written to clarify and increase the scope of the previous version of [tpl]USC|18|1030[/tpl] while, in theory, limiting federal jurisdiction to cases "with a compelling federal interest-i.e., where computers of the federal government or certain financial institutions are involved or where the crime itself is interstate in nature." (see "Protected Computer", below). In addition to clarifying a number of the provisions in the original section 1030, the CFAA also criminalized additional computer-related acts. Provisions addressed the distribution of malicious code and denial of service attacks. Congress also included in the CFAA a provision criminalizing trafficking in passwords and similar items. 
The Act has been amended a number of times—in 1989, 1994, 1996, in 2001 by the USA PATRIOT Act, 2002, and in 2008 by the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act. 

==Protected computers==

The only computers, in theory, covered by the CFAA are defined as “protected computers”. They are defined under section [tpl]USC|18|1030(e)(2)[/tpl] to mean a computer:
In practice, any ordinary computer has come under the jurisdiction of the law, including cellphones, due to the inter-state nature of most internet communication. (See the case history, below).

==Aaron's Law proposal==

In the wake of the prosecution and subsequent suicide of Aaron Swartz, lawmakers have proposed to amend the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Representative Zoe Lofgren has drafted a bill that would help "prevent what happened to Aaron from happening to other Internet users". Aaron's Law ([tpl]USBill|113|hr|2454[/tpl], [tpl]USBill|113|s|1196[/tpl][tpl]USBill|113|hr|2454|site=yes[/tpl]; H.R. 2454 at GovTrack; H.R. 2454 at OpenCongress. [tpl]USBill|113|s|1196|site=yes[/tpl]; S. 1196 at GovTrack; S. 1196 at OpenCongress.) would exclude terms of service violations from the 1984 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and from the wire fraud statute, despite the fact that Swartz was not prosecuted based on Terms of Service violations.news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57564193-93/new-aarons-law-aims-to-alter-controversial-computer-fraud-law/
In addition to Lofgren, Representative Darrell Issa and Representative Jared Polis—all on the House Judiciary Committee, raised questions about the government's handling of the case. Polis called the charges "ridiculous and trumped up," while referring to Swartz as a "martyr." Issa, also chair of the House Oversight Committee, announced that he is investigating the actions of the Justice Department's prosecution.[tpl]cite web|last=Sasso |first=Brendan |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/277353-lawmakers-blast-trumped-up-doj-prosecution-of-internet-activist |title=Lawmakers slam DOJ prosecution of Swartz as 'ridiculous, absurd' - The Hill's Hillicon Valley |publisher=Thehill.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-16[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/15/darrell-issa-aaron-swartz-_n_2481450.html |title=Darrell Issa Probing Prosecution Of Aaron Swartz, Internet Pioneer Who Killed Himself |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= January 15, 2013|accessdate=2013-01-16 |first1=Ryan J. |last1=Reilly[/tpl]
As of May 2014, Aaron's Law was stalled in committee, reportedly due to tech company Oracle's financial interests[tpl]cite news| url=http://o.canada.com/technology/swartz-doc-director-oracle-and-larry-ellison-killed-aarons-law | work=Postmedia | first=Jonathan | last=Dekel | title=Swartz doc director: Oracle and Larry Ellison killed Aaron’s Law | date=May 1, 2014[/tpl]
