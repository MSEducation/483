Marcus Wayne Garland (born October 26, 1950 in Nashville, Tennessee) was a Major League Baseball pitcher from 1973 to 1981 for the Baltimore Orioles and Cleveland Indians. Garland's best season came in 1976 when he posted a win–loss record of 20–7. He signed a 10-year, $2.3 million contract with the Indians as a free agent prior to the 1977 season (which was the first season of large-scale free agency in Major League Baseball). However, he failed to reach the heights of his 1976 season, going on to record a 28–48 win-loss record with Cleveland.  The Indians waived him five years into the deal after the 1981 season. He later served as a minor league manager.
