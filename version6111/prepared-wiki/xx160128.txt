The First Lieutenant — Lieutenant S. Anderson — was fired through a torpedo tube to try to escape, but unfortunately drowned. The captain — Lt. H. Boase — tried to flood the boat in an effort to escape through the fore hatch, but the fender jammed the hatch, so the crew was trapped. The escape attempts were recorded by the commanding officer, and were found corked in a bottle found lying near him when the hull was salvaged. All the crew of C16 died. C16 was salvaged and recommissioned.
C16 was finally sold on the 12 August 1922.
