Nancy Laura Spungen (February 27, 1958 – October 12, 1978) was the girlfriend of Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and a figure of the 1970s punk rock scene. Spungen's life, and her death, have been the subject of controversy among music historians and fans of the Sex Pistols.
Raised in Philadelphia, Spungen was an emotionally disturbed child who was diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 15. After being expelled from college, she went to London at the height of the punk rock craze and became involved with Sid Vicious. Their relationship was punctuated by bouts of domestic violence and drug abuse. The press soon labelled Spungen "Nauseating Nancy" for her shocking behavior. After the Sex Pistols disbanded, the couple moved to New York City and checked into the Hotel Chelsea. They spent their days consuming drugs and were regularly visited by drug dealers.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
In October 1978, Spungen was found dead in the bathroom of the couple's room, of a single stab wound to the abdomen. Sid Vicious was charged with her murder but died of a heroin overdose in February 1979, before the case went to trial. Various authors and filmmakers have speculated about Vicious' role in Spungen's death and the possibility that Spungen was killed by a drug dealer who frequented their room.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Aftermath==

There are several theories that Spungen was murdered by someone other than Vicious, such as one of the two drug dealers who visited the apartment that night, and that a possible robbery was involved, as certain items (including a substantial bankroll) were claimed to be missing from the room.[tpl]cite news|author=Scott, Paul|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1127035/Did-Sid-really-kill-Nancy--Explosive-new-evidence-suggests-punk-rocker-innocent.html |title=Did Sid Really Kill Nancy?

==Other media==

Spungen's mother, Deborah, wrote the memoir And I Don't Want to Live This Life (1983). Its title is taken from a poem Vicious wrote soon after Spungen's death.[tpl]cite journal|date=October 2000|title=The 100 Sleaziest Moments In Rock|journal=Spin|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|volume=16|issue=10|page=101|issn=0886-3032|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HTMuhxamaFEC&pg=PA101&dq=Deborah+Spungen+poem+don%27t+want+to+live&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ptwiUdWNJ6GDywGouYHgBA&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Deborah%20Spungen%20poem%20don%27t%20want%20to%20live&f=false[/tpl]
Samuel Goldwyn Company's biopic Sid and Nancy (1986), directed by Alex Cox, portrays the life of Vicious (played by Gary Oldman) and his relationship with Spungen (played by Chloe Webb). Critics praised Webb's performance as Spungen. In the film, Cox also put forth the theory that Spungen and Vicious had a suicide pact, but they got into an argument when Vicious reneged. The argument escalated when Spungen assaulted Vicious, who was trying to leave the apartment, and as portrayed in the film she was actually stabbed accidentally when she charged him while his knife was out. Subsequent scenes show Spungen having sex with Sid even while she is bleeding to death.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Veronica Schanoes' book Rats appeared in the 2007 Interstitial Arts Foundation anthology Interfictions. The story is a punk rock fairytale inspired by Spungen's life. About her work, the author said: "I wrote Rats because I was angry with the way the recent coffee-table histories of punk seem to have no problem demonizing a dead, mentally ill, teenage girl."[tpl]cite web|title=Interfictions: An Anthology of Interstitial Writing edited by Delia Sherman and Theodora Goss|url=http://www.bookslut.com/fiction/2007_07_011497.php[/tpl]
Alan G. Parker directed the documentary Who Killed Nancy? (2010), which includes interviews with Vicious and Spungen's associates, including John Holmstrom, Don Letts, Glen Matlock,  and Howie Pyro, among others.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
