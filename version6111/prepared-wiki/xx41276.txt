Barbie is a fashion doll manufactured by the American toy-company Mattel, Inc. and launched in March 1959. American businesswoman Ruth Handler is credited with the creation of the doll using a German doll called Bild Lilli as her inspiration.
Barbie is the figurehead of a brand of Mattel dolls and accessories, including other family members and collectible dolls. Barbie has been an important part of the toy fashion doll market for over fifty years, and has been the subject of numerous controversies and lawsuits, often involving parody of the doll and her lifestyle.

==History==

Ruth Handler watched her daughter Barbara play with paper dolls, and noticed that she often enjoyed giving them adult roles. At the time, most children's toy dolls were representations of infants. Realizing that there could be a gap in the market, Handler suggested the idea of an adult-bodied doll to her husband Elliot, a co-founder of the Mattel toy company. He was unenthusiastic about the idea, as were Mattel's directors.
During a trip to Europe in 1956 with her children Barbara and Kenneth, Ruth Handler came across a German toy doll called Bild Lilli.In an interview with M.G.Lord, the author of Forever Barbie, Ruth Handler said that she saw the doll in Lucerne, Switzerland. However, the book points out that on other occasions Handler said that she saw the doll in Zurich or Vienna.  The adult-figured doll was exactly what Handler had in mind, so she purchased three of them. She gave one to her daughter and took the others back to Mattel. The Lilli doll was based on a popular character appearing in a comic strip drawn by Reinhard Beuthin for the newspaper Die Bild-Zeitung. Lilli was a blonde bombshell, a working girl who knew what she wanted and was not above using men to get it. The Lilli doll was first sold in Germany in 1955, and although it was initially sold to adults, it became popular with children who enjoyed dressing her up in outfits that were available separately.
Upon her return to the United States, Handler reworked the design of the doll (with help from engineer Jack Ryan) and the doll was given a new name, Barbie, after Handler's daughter Barbara. The doll made its debut at the American International Toy Fair in New York on March 9, 1959.[tpl]cite web | url=http://jwa.org/thisweek/mar/09/1959/ruth-mosko-handler | title=Ruth Mosko Handler unveils Barbie Doll | publisher=Jewish Women's Archive | accessdate=8 March 2014[/tpl] This date is also used as Barbie's official birthday.
Mattel acquired the rights to the Bild Lilli doll in 1964 and production of Lilli was stopped. The first Barbie doll wore a black and white zebra striped swimsuit and signature topknot ponytail, and was available as either a blonde or brunette. The doll was marketed as a "Teen-age Fashion Model," with her clothes created by Mattel fashion designer Charlotte Johnson. The first Barbie dolls were manufactured in Japan, with their clothes hand-stitched by Japanese homeworkers. Around 350,000 Barbie dolls were sold during the first year of production.
Ruth Handler believed that it was important for Barbie to have an adult appearance, and early market research showed that some parents were unhappy about the doll's chest, which had distinct breasts. Barbie's appearance has been changed many times, most notably in 1971 when the doll's eyes were adjusted to look forwards rather than having the demure sideways glance of the original model.
Barbie was one of the first toys to have a marketing strategy based extensively on television advertising, which has been copied widely by other toys. It is estimated that over a billion Barbie dolls have been sold worldwide in over 150 countries, with Mattel claiming that three Barbie dolls are sold every second.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5370398.stm |work=BBC News | title=Vintage Barbie struts her stuff | date=September 22, 2006 | accessdate=April 26, 2010[/tpl]
The standard range of Barbie dolls and related accessories are manufactured to approximately 1/6 scale, which is also known as playscale.[tpl]cite web|url=http://miniatures.about.com/od/glossaryofminiatureterms/g/playscale.htm |title=Playscale per About.com |publisher=Miniatures.about.com |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 23, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110707075027/http://miniatures.about.com/od/glossaryofminiatureterms/g/playscale.htm| archivedate= July 7, 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The standard dolls are approximately 11½ inches tall.
Barbie products include not only the range of dolls with their clothes and accessories, but also a large range of Barbie branded goods such as books, apparel, cosmetics and video games. Barbie has appeared in a series of animated films and is a supporting character in Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3.
Barbie has become a cultural icon and has been given honors that are rare in the toy world. In 1974, a section of Times Square in New York City was renamed Barbie Boulevard for a week. In 1985, the artist Andy Warhol created a painting of Barbie.[tpl]dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/handler_hi.html |title=Who Made America? | Innovators | Ruth Handler |publisher=Pbs.org |date=June 30, 2004 |accessdate=May 23, 2011[/tpl]

==Controversies==

Criticisms of Barbie are often centred around concerns that children consider Barbie a role model and will attempt to emulate her.

Vintage Barbie dolls from the early years are the most valuable at auction, and while the original Barbie was sold for $3.00 in 1959, a mint boxed Barbie from 1959 sold for $3552.50 on eBay in October 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/scoop_article.asp?ai=6539&si=123|title=1959 Blonde Ponytail Barbie Brings Over $3,000!|date=October 16, 2004|work=Scoop|accessdate=November 6, 2010[/tpl]  On September 26, 2006, a Barbie doll set a world record at auction of £9,000 sterling  (US $17,000) at Christie's in London.

==Competition from Bratz dolls==

In June 2001, MGA Entertainment launched the Bratz series of dolls, a move that gave Barbie her first serious competition in the fashion doll market. In 2004, sales figures showed that Bratz dolls were outselling Barbie dolls in the United Kingdom, although Mattel maintained that in terms of the number of dolls, clothes and accessories sold, Barbie remained the leading brand.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3640958.stm |work=BBC News | title=Bratz topple Barbie from top spot | date=September 9, 2004 | accessdate=April 26, 2010[/tpl] In 2005 figures showed that sales of Barbie dolls had fallen by 30% in the United States, and by 18% worldwide, with much of the drop being attributed to the popularity of Bratz dolls.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4350846.stm |work=BBC News | title=Barbie blues for toy-maker Mattel | date=October 17, 2005 | accessdate=April 26, 2010[/tpl]

=="Barbie Syndrome"==

"Barbie Syndrome" is a term that has been used to depict the desire to have a physical appearance and lifestyle representative of the Barbie doll. It is most often associated with pre-teenage and adolescent females but is applicable to any age group. A person with Barbie syndrome attempts to emulate the doll's physical appearance, even though the doll has unattainable body proportions.Lind, Amy.
