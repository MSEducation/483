Streets of SimCity is a 1997 racing and vehicular combat computer game published by Maxis.  One of the game's main attractions was the ability to explore any  city created in SimCity 2000 by car in a cinematic style. The game, like SimCopter, is in full 3D and the player's vehicle can be controlled using a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. Another notable feature is the game's network mode, in which players can play deathmatches with up to seven other individuals.
Notably, it is one of the few games in the Maxis series that Will Wright did not work on, and the last Maxis game to be developed and released without supervision by Electronic Arts[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/maxis/page9.html | title= SIMply Divine: The story of Maxis Software; page 9: A New Focus, a New Mission | work = Geoff Keighley and GameSpot | accessdate = February 5, 2007 [/tpl] (which acquired Maxis in the two months leading up to release and assisted development of Maxis games thereafter).

==Modifications==

There are few mods available for this game, but the ones that are the easiest to find are skin packs, which give players more cars to choose from in the game. Most are still based on the original cars' designs, however. Some examples include the De Lorean from Back to the Future, an ambulance, a fire truck, and new race cars.

The soundtrack of the game was composed by Jerry Martin, who is also known for composing the music for The Sims and SimCity series.
