On February 20, 1863, Kansas Governor Thomas Carney signed into law a bill creating the state university in Lawrence.History of KU - Kansas Historical Society  The law was conditioned upon a gift from Lawrence of a $15,000 endowment fund and a site for the university, in or near the town, of not less than forty acres (16 ha) of land.[tpl]cite web| last =Griffin | first =C.S. | title =The University of Kansas and the Years of Frustration, 1854–64 | url =http://www.kshs.org/publicat/khq/1966/66_1_griffin.htm | accessdate =2009-12-04[/tpl]  If Lawrence failed to meet these conditions, Emporia instead of Lawrence would get the university.
The site selected for the university was a hill known as Mount Oread, which was owned by former Kansas Governor Charles L. Robinson.  Robinson and his wife Sara bestowed the [tpl]convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on[/tpl] site to the State of Kansas in exchange for land elsewhere.  The philanthropist Amos Adams Lawrence donated $10,000 of the necessary endowment fund, and the citizens of Lawrence raised the remaining cash by issuing notes backed by Governor Carney.  On November 2, 1863, Governor Carney announced that Lawrence had met the conditions to get the state university, and the following year the university was officially organized.[tpl]cite web| title =Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History | url =http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/u/university_of_kansas.html[/tpl]
