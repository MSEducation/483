Eliot Glacier is a glacier on the northeastern slopes of Mount Hood in the U.S state of Oregon.[tpl]Cite map|publisher=TopoQwest (United States Geological Survey Maps)|title=Mount Hood North, OR|url=http://www.topoquest.com/map.php?lat=45.38123&lon=-121.68035&datum=nad83&zoom=4|accessdate=August 11, 2012[/tpl] Researchers have reported that Eliot Glacier covered an area of [tpl]convert|395|acres[/tpl] in 2004 but had retreated [tpl]convert|680|m[/tpl] since 1901, though that decline was less than all but one other glacier on Mount Hood. The glacier's situation on a northeast slope, its higher altitude accumulation zone close to the summit of Mount Hood and its high level of talus debris may explain its slower retreat.[tpl]cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Keith|coauthors=Andrew Fountain|title=Spatial and morphological change on Eliot Glacier, Mount Hood, Oregon, USA|journal=Annals of Glaciology|year=2007|volume=46|pages=222â€“226|url=http://geopulse.org/kjack/downloads/jackson_fountain_annals.pdf|accessdate=August 11, 2012|format=pdf|doi=10.3189/172756407782871152[/tpl]
