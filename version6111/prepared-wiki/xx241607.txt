==History==

In 2012, 411 Seniors Centre relocated to Terminal Avenue in Vancouver.  411 Seniors had since 2006 owned and operated the 4 storey tall building at Dunsmuir and Homer Streets. The Vancouver Trades and Labour Council erected the building in 1910 from union members' contributions.  The building has had a long list of occupants and the provincial government took over its ownership in 1921.
411 Seniors itself began in 1947 when seniors programs occupied the first two floors, and the society itself was constituted in 1972.http://www.411seniors.bc.ca/Contentpages/building_history.htm
411 Seniors is known for its multicultural and LGBT programming, as well as income tax and information referral advocacy.  There are many recreational leisure opportunities for seniors.  It also maintains a low-cost cafeteria on the first floor.
