Bransdale is a valley running south through North Yorkshire, England, and part of the North York Moors National Park. Sandwiched between Bilsdale to the west and Farndale to the east, it is formed from the dales of Bransdale itself at the top of the valley, Sleightholmedale and Kirkdale. It carries a river called Hodge Beck en route from Cockayne to the River Dove from Farndale three miles south of Kirkbymoorside, which runs on into the Vale of Pickering and the River Rye.
Bransdale is also a civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ryedale.gov.uk/scripts/htm_hl.pl?DB=ryedale&STEMMER=en&WORDS=bransdal&ALL=&ANY=&EXACTB=0&PHRASE=&EXACTP=0&CATEGORIES=&SIMPLE=bransdale&COLOUR=Fuchsia&STYLE=s&URL=http://www.ryedale.gov.uk/council_and_democracy-old/elected_representatives/parish_and_town_councils/bransdale.aspx#muscat_highlighter_first_match|title=Bransdale Parish Council|publisher=Ryedale District Council|accessdate=14 March 2011[/tpl]
