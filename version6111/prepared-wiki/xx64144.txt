==Plot==

The story concerns a group of guys who have made a deal to each invest in a fund, which would be paid to the last remaining bachelor of the group. Michael Delaney, a cartoonist, attempts to get the other remaining bachelor, Kyle Brenner, married to a statuesque policewoman who Kyle said was the one that got away, so Michael can claim the fund to pay off a gambling debt. Unfortunately, the statuesque policewoman Kyle is trying to marry is the woman Michael has fallen in love with, Officer Natalie Parker. Michael then gets himself into all sorts of misadventures, from getting captured by a young woman and her grandmother with a bizarre BDSM fetish (the young woman seems like a quiet librarian at first glance) to trying to retrieve Kyle's surgically removed testicle, all the while attempting to pay off his gambling debt to the honked-off mobster menacing through selling his possessions, relieving himself of his "Tomcat" status, overcoming his fear of commitment, and finding true love.
