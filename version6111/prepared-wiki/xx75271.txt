==Location==

Blandford is situated between Cranborne Chase and the Dorset Downs, at the south eastern corner of the Blackmore Vale, [tpl]convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] northwest of Poole and [tpl]convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] southwest of Salisbury.

==History==

Blandford has been a fording point since Anglo-Saxon times, when it was recorded as Blaen-y-ford and as Blaneford in the Domesday Book, meaning ford of the river of blay, or bleak (Alburnus alburnus).OED, s.v. "blay". By the 13th century it had become an important market town[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl] with a livestock market serving the nearby Blackmore Vale with its many dairy farms. The Latin word Forum, meaning market, was recorded in 1540.Mills, A. D., 1986. Dorset Place Names''. Ensign, Southampton. It was an important break on the journey between the port of Weymouth and the capital London. There is still a weekly outdoor market and a bi-weekly indoor market held in the Corn Exchange[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
In 1731 much of the town was destroyed in a fire. John and William Bastard rebuilt the town over the following 30 years and the town centre features Georgian architecture from the 1730s to 1760s.

==Architecture==

Blandford Forum is often given as an example of a Georgian town, as the entire centre was rebuilt at once in the 18th century, due to the fire of 1731, and is hence uniformly Georgian. All façades remain in fair to good condition, and notable buildings include the Corn Exchange, and the 1732 parish church of St Peter and St Paul, a classical building with a cupola on top of the tower. The interior remains relatively unaffected by Victorian interference and retains its galleries, font, pulpit, box-pews and mayoral seat. In 1893 the church was enlarged by moving the apsidal sanctuary out on rollers onto new foundations and building a new chancel behind it.Betjeman, John, ed. (1968) Collins Pocket Guide to English Parish Churches; the South. London: Collins; p. 172
To the south of the town a six arch stone bridge spans the River Stour.

==Demography==

Five district electoral wards (Blandford Damory Down, Blandford Hilltop, Blandford Langton St.Leonards, Blandford Old Town and Blandford Station) comprise the town and parish of Blandford Forum, with a built-up area totalling [tpl]convert|310|ha[/tpl]. Census returns for the town show that it had a population of less than 4,000 until 1981, after which it increased rapidly; in the 2001 Census, the town had 4,524 dwellings and a population of 8,760,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dorsetforyou.com/343562 |title=Blandford |publisher=dorsetforyou.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-28[/tpl] of whom 96.5% were White British. Some of the population increase however can be accounted for by a boundary change which incorporated housing estates that already existed but were previously within a different parish (Pimperne) on the town's northern side.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] The 2009 mid-year population estimate is 9,200. Unemployment varied between 0.5% and 2.3% between 1997 and 2009. Census figures for the town are shown in the table below:
