[[Mutual Core]]

"Mutual Core" is a song recorded by Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk for her seventh studio album Biophilia (2011). It was written and produced by Björk herself, while programming and beats were made in collaboration with Matthew Herbert and the English dubstep band 16bit. "Mutual Core" is an uptempo experimental song. Its music includes Pipe organ, electronica-tinged sounds and features the Choir Graduale Nobili, the choir featured on Biophilia. The song's lyrics are a metaphor for human relationships, compared to the structure of the Earth and Plate tectonics. The song was well received by contemporary music critics, who compared its sound to the work of The Chemical Brothers and praised its production and beats, moreover appreciating Björk's voice on the track.
As with all the songs on Biophilia, an app was made for the song, which features a video game in which the player have to move geological layers as an accordion to play chords. Though the song wasn't released as a single, a music video was produced, directed by Andrew Thomas Huang. The video was critically applauded and received further attention when it got projected for one month in Times Square in 2013, and then across the 7 continents. Björk promoted the song by performing it throughout her Biophilia Tour.
Three remixes by Matthew Herbert, 16bit and These New Puritans were released as part of Biophilia Remix Series. The Matthew Herbert's and the These New Puritans remixes were later included on bastards (2012). On July 2012, the online music store Beatport announced a fan contest in which "Mutual Core" had to be remixed, to be released afterwards on a remix package.

==Background==

At the end of 2010, Björk confirmed she was working on a new album.[tpl]cite web|last=Dombal|first=Ryan|title=Björk Talks About Icelandic Energy Controversy|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/40844-bjork-talks-about-icelandic-energy-controversy/|publisher=Pitchfork. Ryan Schreiber|accessdate=3 November 2012[/tpl] In an interview published on Fréttablaðið, the singer stated that the project was midway through the completion and that she hoped to go on tour before the end of 2011.[tpl]cite journal|last=Helgason|first=Stigur|title=Á Íslandi er náttúran pönk|journal=Fréttablaðið|publisher=365 prentmiðlar|date=January 2011|accessdate=3 November 2012[/tpl] The project was officialised in March 2011, with the announcement of Björk performance at Manchester International Festival.[tpl]cite web|title=BJÖRK UNVEILS LIVE RESIDENCY|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/10006/1/bjork-unveils-live-residency|work=Dazed & Confused|publisher=Waddell Limited|accessdate=3 November 2012[/tpl] The project, called Biophilia, comprises a series of live performances, a new website, a documentary and a series of apps, besides the release as a music album which is partly composed on an iPad.[tpl]cite web|title=Bjork, Damon Albarn, Snoop Dogg for Manchester International Festival|url=http://www.nme.com/news/bjork/55508|work=NME|publisher=IPC Media|accessdate=3 November 2012[/tpl] The Biophilia Tour was said to be touring eight cities for three years[tpl]cite web|title=Björk Unveils "Biophilia": Lead Single "Crystalline" Available Now, Apps to Come|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/bjork-unveils-biophilia-lead-single-crystalline-available-now-apps-come-2011-06-29|publisher=Nonesuch Records|accessdate=3 November 2012[/tpl] and to be including a series of workshops for children in collaboration with local schools. The first details about "Mutual Core" came regarding its app, which was described to allow users to "arrange geological layers to form chords".
[tpl]Quote box|width=40%|align=right|quote="Eruptions and earthquakes, the building of continents, the formation of mountain ranges and oceanic trenches, all are powerful geological signs of earth’s underlying structure and mechanics. In Mutual Core earth’s geology is transformed into a metaphor for human relationships. Opposing forces of compression and release, central to continent building and to human feelings, are expressed sonically, and in the app, by the contrast between the shifting of chords in the verse and uplifting chorus. The contrast can also be seen in the contrasting visual patterns of the animation, and is evoked by Björk’s working title for this track, ’organ plaid’, which describes an interwoven musical fabric. While the song’s themes are universal, the lyrics indicate a specific, autobiographically significant geographical region: the boundary of the north american and eurasian tectonic plates, on which sits Björk’s birthplace —Iceland."|source=—Presentation of the song on the official App.[tpl]cite web|title=Mutual Core|url=http://bjork.fr/Mutual-Core|publisher=bjork.fr|accessdate=4 November 2012[/tpl][/tpl]
"Mutual Core" was written and produced by Björk, while the beat of the song was made in collaboration with Matthew Herbert and 16bit. The song was engineered by Damian Taylor and Sveinn Kjartansson, with mixing provided by Taylor and Björk. "Mutual Core"'s lyrics were inspired by human relationships[tpl]cite book|last=Debben|first=Nikki|title=Biophilia Manual Edition|year=2011[/tpl] and by Björk's family decisions, who had to decide where her daughter, Ísadóra, would go to school between New York City and Reykjavík.[tpl]cite news|last=Fusilli|first=Jim|title=Bells, Whistles, Chimes and Charm|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203388804576615273413178318.html|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones & Company|accessdate=3 November 2012[/tpl] Björk felt that the song is "the most personal the album for me". David Fricke of Rolling Stone noted that "Björk likens the human emotions – love, physical obsession, changing moods, violent hurt – in songs such as "Mutual Core", "Moon" and "Virus" to natural phenomena: earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, lunar phases and contagious disease".[tpl]cite web|last=Fricke|first=David|title=Bjork Premieres Multimedia 'Biophilia' at Spectacular Iceland Concert|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/bjork-premieres-multimedia-biophilia-at-spectacular-iceland-concert-20111013|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|accessdate=3 November 2012|date=13 October 2011[/tpl]
Three official remixes of the song have been released. The first one was released on Biophilia Remix Series VI on 25 June 2012,[tpl]cite web|title=remix series 6 out now!|url=http://bjork.com/#/news/remixseries6outnow!|accessdate=3 November 2012|publisher=Bjork.com[/tpl] and it is a remix by long time-collaborator Matthew Herbert. Björk stated about Herbert's remixes: "He has taken it full on and made it into his version but still true to the heart of the song and, more than once, improved it". RJ Cubarrubia of Rolling Stone commented that the remix "builds slowly with background bleeps and opaque textures before erupting into a cacophonous rumble".
The second one is a remix by 16bit, which was released as part of Biophilia Remix Series VII on July 9, 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=remix series 7 out now|url=http://bjork.com/#/news/remixseries7outnow|accessdate=3 November 2012|publisher=Bjork.com[/tpl] This version had already been released as part of a promo for Icelandair flights, playing the song in flights to Iceland during Björk's concert residency in Reykjavik in Summer 2011. Other two remixes of "Crystalline" and "Sacrifice" were played.
The last remix by These New Puritans has been on November 12, 2012 on Biophilia Remix Series VIII. The remix includes samples from the Traditional composition "Funeral Song (Solomon Islands 1978)", as extracted from the album Spirit of Melanesia by David Fanshawe. On October 8, 2012, the tracklist for bastards was announced, and the Matthew Herbert's and the These New Puritans remixes were included.[tpl]cite web|title=BJÖRK ANNOUNCES REMIX ALBUM ENTITLED BASTARDS FEATURING HUDMO, DEATH GRIPS|url=http://www.factmag.com/2012/10/08/bjork-announces-remix-album-entitled-bastards-featuring-hudmo-death-grips/|work=Fact|publisher=The Vinyl Factory|accessdate=4 November 2012[/tpl] On late July 2012, Beatport announced a contest in which the participants had to remix "Mutual Core".[tpl]cite web|title=remix mutual core!|url=http://bjork.com/#/news/remixmutualcore!|publisher=bjork.com|accessdate=3 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Bjork Mutual Core – Remix Competition|url=http://www.noisemademedoit.com/bjork-remix-competition/|publisher=Noise Made Me Do It|accessdate=3 November 2012[/tpl] The winner would have their remix released on One Little Indian Records in a remix package to be sold on the website.[tpl]cite web|title=Björk Mutual Core Remix Contest|url=https://play.beatport.com/contests/bjork-mutual-core/|publisher=Beatport|accessdate=3 November 2012[/tpl] The winner was announced on 18 September 2012, as "Breakwave".

==Composition==

"Mutual Core" is an uptempo[tpl]cite web|last=Chafin|first=Chris|title=With 'Biophilia', Bjork comes back to earth, just a little|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/10/3700075/biophilia-bjork-comes-back-earth-just-little|work=Capital FM|publisher=Global Radio|accessdate=4 November 2012[/tpl] experimental song, which displays elements from electro, techno, glitch, breakcore[tpl]cite web|last=Bartlam|first=Leigh|title=björk: biophilia|url=http://wearsthetrousers.com/2011/10/bjork-biophilia/|publisher=Wearsthetrousers|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=10 October 2011[/tpl] and ambient,[tpl]cite web|last=Diver|first=Mark|title=Björk Biophilia Review|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/5zq4|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=29 September 2011[/tpl] and includes also a choral part during the chorus. The rhythm of the song can be roughly divided into two distinct parts: the verses, which feature moderately sparse electronic beats and a time signature of 5/4, and the choruses, which display more upbeat sounds and a 2/4 time signature. According to Mark Diver of BBC Music during the shift from the verse and the chorus the song "slips from blissful ambience into bombastic electronic percussion, leaving the senses reeling, only to fade back into a comforting lilt".
The instrumentation of the verses includes a pipe organ. Sound designer David Paterson described the way Björk wanted the music on "Mutual Core": "Bjork described the sounds she wanted in a way that left it very open to interpretation. With the track "Mutual Core", for example, she described how it was about magnetic attraction – which doesn’t really have a sound that springs to mind".[tpl]cite journal|last=Burrows|first=Tim|title=MATTHEW HERBERT & DAVID PATERSON|journal=Dazed & Confused|publisher=Waddell Limited|date=4 July 2011|volume=200|issue=Björk shows you the future[/tpl] Luke Turner of NME noted that "Björk's voice cracks against the increasing, insistent power of the electronic rhythms, as if recognising our human insignificance in the face of geology", citing the verse "As fast as your fingernail grows / The Atlantic ridge drifts" as an example,[tpl]cite journal|last=Turner|first=Luke|title=Bjork Biophilia|work=NME|publisher=IPC Media|date=8 October 2011[/tpl] and, on a similar note, Odile De Plas of Télérama found the singer's voice "strong, acrobat, guttural and ... crystalline".[tpl]cite journal|last=De Plas|first=Odile|title=Digitale Diva|journal=Télérama|publisher=Le Monde S.A|date=14 September 2011[/tpl]
The musical shift occurs when the singer pronounces the words "Core", during which, as described by Nikki Debben in her essay included in the Manual Edition of Biophilia, the "modality switches from minor to major". The lecturer noted that "the close, dark sound of the verse is partly due to the minor mode which has a flattened third degree, compared to the brighter sound of the chorus in the major mode which has the "normal" third degree of the chord". This part of the song uses a Plagal cadence, which involves a movement "from a chord built on the fourth degree of the scale to one built on the first degree of the scale". The chorus of the song features a vocal crescendo performed by the choir, which juxtaposes with breakcore-influenced beats, which display elements from dub. Chris Chafin of Capital compared the sound of the chorus to the work of The Chemical Brothers and stated that tracks like "Crystalline" and "Mutual Core" recall previous works from Björk's discography, especially Post (1995) and Homogenic (1997).

==Critical reception==

The song was generally well received by music critics, who cited it as a highlight of the album. According to Mark Pytlik of Pitchfork, the song "may be the album’s best track overall", citing "its satisfyingly filthy electro skronk",[tpl]cite web|last=Pytlik|first=Mark|title=Björk Biophilia|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15915-biophilia/|publisher=Pitchfork. Ryan Schreiber|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=13 October 2011[/tpl] while giving the album an average review; on a similar note, Arnold Pan of PopMatters defined the song as "the album’s most viscerally powerful number" citing that "that’s music that sounds just as at home in the sacred place of a vast cathedral as it is in the virtual vacuum of cyberspace".[tpl]cite web|last=Pan|first=Arnold|title=Björk: Biophilia|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/149726-bjoerk-biophilia/|publisher=PopMatters|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=10 October 2011[/tpl] Gareth James of Clash praised the album and stated that "when the machine-gun beats do break through on "Mutual Core", they’re augmented by a hymnal organ riff and a soaring, unprocessed and unleashed vocal which will leave you breathless".[tpl]cite web|last=James|first=Gareth|title=Biophilia – Beautifully warm and compellingly human|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/bjork-biophilia|work=Clash|accessdate=4 November 2012[/tpl]
"Mutual Core" was described as "best" and "climactic" by Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph, which elected Biophilia as the CD of the Week,[tpl]cite news|last=Brown|first=Helen|title=Björk: Biophilia, CD of the week|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/cdreviews/8811194/Bjork-Biophilia-CD-of-the-week.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=6 October 2011|location=London[/tpl] and "literally volcanic" by Heather Phares of Allmusic.[tpl]cite web|last=Phares|first=Heather|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/biophilia-mw0002165493|title=Biophilia - Björk|date=|accessdate=12 April 2013|publisher=Allmusic. Rovi Corporation[/tpl] Jim Fusilli of The Wall Street Journal stated that the track is "earthbound". According to the Daily Mirror review, the track "adds angry rebuke and glitchy distorted power chordings to the shimmering, ringing percussion and natural awe that feature on the astonishing tracks "Virus" and aptly named "Crystalline"".[tpl]cite web|title=Bjork: Biophilia|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/going-out/music/bjork-biophilia-83420|work=Daily Mirror|publisher=Trinity Mirror|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=7 October 2011[/tpl] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised the composition of the album and stated "There’s something audacious and impressive about the way "Hollow" attempts to strike a weird balance between menace and calm, the vocals as lulling as the staccato backing is unsettling. Or "Mutual Core"’s repeated shifts from a wheezing keyboard – it was doubtless built in a laboratory by the provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and professor Brian Cox, but it sounds like a 13th-century portative organ – to electronic bombardment".[tpl]cite news|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|title=Björk: Biophilia – review|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/oct/06/bjork-biophilia-cd-review|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=6 October 2011|location=London[/tpl] Möhammed Choudhery of Consequence of Sound analysed the use of Björk's voice in the album, stating:
 Her unique utility of the English language gives her words a quirky, idiosyncratic edge, allowing lines like “if you forget my name, you’ll go astray/ like a killer whale” to ring somehow striking. Said masterstrokes and quirks are well intact here, as is evident in the asteroid-bass volley of "Mutual Core" and lead single "Crystalline"‘s apocalyptical breakbeat coda.
 Biophilia‘s finest moments are its most subtly captivating, many of which are (admittedly) almost forgettable on first listen. The aforementioned "Mutual Core" and "Crystalline" can be assured a spot on any and all future Best of Björk compilations, compelling in how they blend archaic instrumentation with blistering electronica.[tpl]cite web|last=Choudhery|first=Möhammed|title=Album Review: Björk – Biophilia|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/10/album-review-bjork-biophilia/|publisher=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=7 October 2011[/tpl]
Despite this, some critics dubbed the song as "tedious"[tpl]cite web|last=Reed|first=Ryan|title=Bjork [tpl]![/tpl] Biophilia|url=http://thephoenix.com/Boston/music/127424-bjork-biophilia/|work=The Phoenix|publisher=Phoenix Media/Communications Group|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=27 September 2011[/tpl] and "interesting but not surprising".[tpl]cite news|last=Roberts|first=Randall|title=Album review: Bjork's ‘Biophilia'|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/10/album-review-bjorks-biophilia.html|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=17 October 2011[/tpl] Andy Gill of The Independent gave a negative review of the album, praising only the choral elements, stating that: "they’re a constant delight as she reflects upon her desire for the "dangerous gifts" of elemental nature, the lightning-flash of creative inspiration ("Thunderbolt"); muses about being a bead threaded upon a DNA chain ("Hollow"); explores the ethically neutral, natural attraction of parasite to host ("Virus"); admires the creative force of volcanic energy ("Mutual Core")".[tpl]cite news|last=Gill|first=Andy|title=Album: Bjork, Biophilia (One Little Indian)|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-bjork-biophilia-one-little-indian-2366467.html|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent Print Limited|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=7 October 2011|location=London[/tpl]

As Björk explains on the video:
 This app is called 'Mutual Core' and it's about taking the tectonic plates and pushing them together with effort until you create a mutual core beneath them. In musicology-wise this is to teach you about chords, and you can use .. the tectonic plates, the strata inside them, and it sorta operates like accordion so you can change the chords and push them together and ... create a mutual core.

==Music video==

===Background and development===

A music video for the song was commissioned by the director of Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), Jeffrey Deitch.[tpl]cite web|last=Pasternack|first=Alex|title=Björk's Vision Quest|url=http://www.papermag.com/2012/11/bjork_vision_quest_art_music.php|work=Paper|publisher=Paper Publishing Inc|accessdate=9 November 2012[/tpl] The video was first revealed to be in the making in the September 2012 issue of Dazed & Confused, in an interview with Andrew Thomas Huang.[tpl]cite news|last=Orton|first=Karen|title=Björk selects Andrew Thomas Huang|url=http://www.bjork.fr/Dazed-Confused-sept-2012|accessdate=2 November 2012|date=1 September 2012|publisher=Bjork.fr[/tpl] Huang was revealed to be chosen as the director for the video by Björk herself. Huang said about the making process:
 "There's a lot of volcanic and earthy stuff in the video, we put Björk in quite a few uncomfortable set-ups when we were filming, but she was game for anything. She was a lot of fun and just very warm and trusting." 
The director also hinted at a parallelism between the video and its short film Solipsist, which was released weeks before the shooting of "Mutual Core" video: "song is a metaphor between earth’s crust and two people converging, and the effort that it takes, that was also what Solipsist was about, so working together made sense". The video was shot in Reykjavík in over two days.[tpl]cite web|last=Brunswick|first=Alexis|title="Core" Strength|url=http://www.style.com/stylefile/2012/11/core-strength/|publisher=Style.com. Fairchild Fashion Group|accessdate=13 November 2012|date=12 November 2012[/tpl] The director wrote the initial treatment for the video after visiting museums in London. The video features a mix of CG pictures and real natural elements, gathered by the team from different location in Iceland. The floating rocks in the video are made from foam and covered in plaster, fossilized barnacles and various textiles, the rock's tongues and the sand are computer animated; for this reason, the post-production lasted two months. Björk's face motion was tracked in CG for the video, in which it appears to be melt in the rocks. Her costumes were inspired by Thai and Indonesian costumes, while the substance which resembles magma that she appears to spit in the video was a computer-modified mixture of ketchup and cake batter.
A teaser trailer has been released on 5 November 2012. The teaser shows Björk stuck in a bed of quicksand, wearing a blue wig.[tpl]cite news|title=Bjork's 'Mutual Core' Music Video Premieres On MOCAtv; Here's A Deliciously Bizarre Preview (PHOTOS)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/07/bjorks-mutual-core-music-_n_2088700.html|work=The Huffington Post|publisher=AOL|accessdate=9 November 2012|first=Priscilla|last=Frank|date=7 November 2012[/tpl] The video was premiered at an exclusive screening at the MOCA Grand Avenue on November 12, 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=MOCAtv Debuts Bjork’s New Music Video|url=http://blogs.kcrw.com/members/mocatv-debuts-bjorks-new-music-video|accessdate=2 November 2012|publisher=KCRW[/tpl] It was digitally released on November 13, 2012 on MOCA youtube's channel, MOCAtv, as part of a series of music videos called ART+MUSIC which features collaborations between artists and musicians.[tpl]cite news|title=MOCAtv is HERE!|url=http://www.moca.org/audio/blog/?p=3627|accessdate=2 November 2012|publisher=MOCA[/tpl] The channel also posted a behind-the-scenes video on the same day.

===Synopsis===

In the beginning of the video, soil crumbles down, as Björk appears, buried to her waist in the sand, wearing a golden dress (by Michael van der Ham), a brooch on her shoulder designed by the singer herself[tpl]cite web|last=Jabr|first=Ferris|title=Geology Porn: The Science and Art of Bjork’s "Mutual Core" Music Video|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/brainwaves/2012/11/15/geology-porn-the-science-and-art-of-bjorks-mutual-core-music-video/|work=Scientific American|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|accessdate=16 January 2013|date=15 November 2012[/tpl] and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the sand, and they become part of two rock sprites, that come out of the sand and start writhing around Björk, while strata emerges from them. In the end of the first verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Björk grabs the sand and let it slips out from her fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from the sand and revolve around Björk, who dances in the sand. Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Björk. The strata of the rocks morph to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Björk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themself, whilst various rocks on the sand start to erupt. Lava, magma, smoke and fire storm while Björk's face appears in the lava. Every rock erupts noisily, causing a rain of volcanic ash.
The video shifts again to Björk buried in the sand under the rain of ashes. The two pieces of rock appear again, this time each one with a Björk-shaped strata. The strata also sing parts of the song, and two arms come out from the floating rocks and their hands barely brush against each other. The rocks unite once again as the chorus begins for the second time. During this part of the video, images of Björk singing in a smoky setting alternate with more rocks uniting to the main two, while their Björk-shaped strata secrete a substance similar to lava from their mouth. All the rocks are now united, forming a big volcano, whose crater is shaped like two opposite Björk-shaped rocks. The volcano finally erupts in an explosion of magma, while a thunderstorm occurs in the background. The video ends as the volcano fades out and all that remains visible is ash and smoke.

===Reception and accolades===

Commenting on the choice of bringing Björk's video projection worldwide, Nina Colosi, founder and creative director of Streaming Museum, stated:
 In the music video Mutual Core directed by Andrew Thomas Huang, Björk is organically part of nature and universe. The human connection to nature is a theme that underpins most of her artistic output. It’s particularly meaningful to bring Björk’s vision to 7 continents because of its relevance to all cultures.
