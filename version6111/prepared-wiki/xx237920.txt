[[Öræfasveit]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Iceland

Öræfasveit or Öræfi (previously called Litlahérað) is a western region in Austur-Skaftafellssýsla, between Breiðamerkursandur and the river Skeiðará, east of the village Kirkjubæjarklaustur and South, West and East of the volcano Öræfajökull. It has been a part of the municipality of Hornafjörður since 1998. In the Middle Ages, this region was called Hérað or Litlahérað, but was deserted in the wake of the 1362 eruption of Öræfajökull and the subsequent flooding of the region. After these events the region was simply called Öræfi ("wilderness").
For a long time, the region was very isolated since two large rivers hindered the pathway from both from the east and west. This isolation continued until Jökulsá á Breiðamerkursandi bridged the gap in 1967 and the Skeiðará bridge was opened in 1974 with the Ring Road.
Skaftafell National Park was established in Öræfasveit in 1967 and merged into the much larger Vatnajökull National Park in 2008.
