Leratswana is a small township in the Free State province of South Africa, adjacent to Arlington. Arlington was established as an important railway link between Lindley and Senekal.

==Geography and Layout==

Leratswana (like all Free State towns) features a racial segregated geography due to the policies of Apartheid. This can be seen by the fact that the white population live in the town of Arlington, while the non-white (almost exclusively black) community lives in the neighboring township of Leratswana, which is currently being greatly extended. Leratswana has by far a greater population than Arlington, and therefore if the two were part of a single town, it would have a black majority.
Although very few non-whites have moved into the actual town of 'Arlington', this remains minimal.

==Road==

Leratswana lies on the R707, which separates Arlington from Leratswana. This road connects the towns of Lindley and Senekal.
