The Division of Kingston is an Australian Electoral Division in South Australia covering the far-south portion of the Adelaide metropolitan area. The division was first proclaimed in 1949.
The division is named after Charles Kingston, Premier of South Australia (1893-1899), elected to the first House of Representatives in 1901 and the first Federal member of the Division of Adelaide in 1903. The Liberals and Labor have both alternated for long spells in the seat. It has tended to elect an MP from the governing party of the day, having elected only four opposition MPs. Notably, every sitting member in the electorate's history has been defeated at the pollsâ€”none have retired or resigned.[tpl]cite news|first=Ian|last=Munro|title=Labor incumbent looks safe in see-saw seat|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-election/labor-incumbent-looks-safe-in-seesaw-seat-20100725-10qlg.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=26 July 2010|accessdate=4 January 2011[/tpl]  
Kingston has been represented by Labor MP Amanda Rishworth since the 2007 election. Going into the 2010 election, it was the most marginal Labor seat in South Australia. However, Rishworth technically made it a safe Labor seat by winning 64 percent of the two-party vote. 
The redistribution before the 2013 election removed Kingston's rural areas with the transfer of around 6,500 voters in McLaren Vale and Willunga to Mayo, increasing Labor's margin by half a percent. This substantially reduced the area covered by the electorate, down from 377 to 171 square kilometres, almost the same as 2001 boundaries. The previous larger boundaries were used from 2010 to 2004 and 1998 to 1993. Boundaries from 1990 to 1984 were similar to the current but without the southern coastal strip.
At the election Rishworth won 59.7 percent of the two-party vote and is still the second-safest Labor seat in South Australia.
