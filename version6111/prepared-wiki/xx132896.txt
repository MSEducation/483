The Sudbury Theatre Centre is a professional theatre company, located in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.
Following an Ontario government report in 1967 which recommended the creation of a theatre company in Sudbury, local arts patrons Sonja Dunn, Carolyn Fouriezos, Bill Hart, Bob Remnant and Peg Roberts raised funds to bring the Gryphon Theatre Company of Barrie to Sudbury for a production of Neil Simon's Come Blow Your Horn. That production was staged at Laurentian University's Fraser Auditorium in May 1970.
Following that production, the Sudbury Theatre Centre was officially incorporated on September 14, 1971. Over the next number of years, the STC staged plays and children's theatre workshops at Fraser Auditorium, Cambrian College and the Inco Club.  Its success was largely due to the dedication of long standing artistic director Tony Lloyd who made it his mission to build a theatre for the people of Sudbury.
In 1980, the city of Sudbury donated a parcel of municipal land on Shaughnessy Street near Civic Square to the STC for the construction of their own permanent 289-seat theatre. Construction began in July 1981, and the new facility was officially opened at the launch of the company's 1982 theatre season.
The company's current artistic director is David Savoy.
