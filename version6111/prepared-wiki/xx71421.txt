Other common names include weeping kōwhai and small-leaved kōwhai. It is also referred to as South Island Kowhai although this name is misleading since it is widely distributed all over New Zealand including the North Island, though less common in Northland.
The specific epithet microphylla means "small-leaved".[tpl]cite book|last=Harrison|first=Lorraine|title=RHS Latin for gardeners|year=2012|publisher=Mitchell Beazley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=9781845337315|pages=224[/tpl] S. microphylla has smaller leaves (around 3–6 mm long by 2–5 mm wide) and flowers (1.8-5.0 cm long),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora_details.asp?ID=1302|publisher=New Zealand Plant Conservation Network|title=S. microphylla description|accessdate=10 May 2012[/tpl] than the other well known species large-leaved kōwhai.
