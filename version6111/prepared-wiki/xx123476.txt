[tpl]nihongo|Saint Beast|セイント·ビースト[/tpl] is a Japanese action/fantasy story created by Arisugawa Kei centering around gods, guardian angels, animal spirits, and magic.  It is a spin-off of the series Angel Tales.
Saint Beast is originally a CD drama centering on the lives of the six Holy Beasts, and their attraction to one another. Seeing the CD Drama being a huge success and spawning over 20 CDs, Wonderfarm created the small 6 episode series for fan service. As of 2005 two new OVAs were made, but this time they focused on what had happened back in the heavens. Recently in the early 2006, a new side story of Saint Beast called Saint Beast:Others was started. And the first CD drama was released on September 21, 2006. In 2007, another Saint Beast series called Saint Beast - Kouin Jojishi Tenshi Tan started.
