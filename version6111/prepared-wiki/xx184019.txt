CATEGORIES: Catholic titular sees in Asia

Livias was a city in Palestina Prima, and was an episcopal see, a suffragan of the Caesarea in Palaestina. The traditional location of the Roman city is at Tell er-Rameh, a small hill rising in the plain beyond Jordan, about twelve miles from Jericho.Morris Jastrow and Frants Buhl, “Beth–Aram,” Jewish Encyclopedia (New York, N.Y.: Funk & Wagnalls, 1906), 119; Siméon Vailhé, “Livias,” trans.

However, new evidence from the Tall el-Hammam Excavation Project raises questions about this identification. When the archaeological evidence is compared with data derived from the textual sources, a new theory is proposed that, while Tall er-Rameh was the commercial and residential center of Livias, the area around Tall el-Hammam, which grew in the Early Roman period, was the administrative epicentre of Livias.Graves, David E., and Scott Stripling. “Re-Examination of the Location for the Ancient City of Livias.” Levant 43, no. 2 (2011): 178–200. Archaeological evidence from Shuneh al-Janubiyyah has shown the existence of a church in the diocese, dating from the sixth-eighth centuries.The Christian Sanctuaries in Transjordan 07 A third Byzantine church was discovered between Tall Kafrayn and Tall el-Hammam (2.6 km to the west of Tall el-Hammam) with a large mosaic floor now being used as a Muslim cemetery.Graves, David E., and Scott Stripling. “Re-Examination of the Location for the Ancient City of Livias.” Levant 43, no. 2 (2011): 195.
