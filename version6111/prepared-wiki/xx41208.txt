[[Rangefinder]]

CATEGORIES: Firearm sights, Forestry tools

A rangefinder is a device that measures distance from the observer to a target.

==Techniques==

Some devices use active methods to measure (such as ultrasonic ranging module, laser rangefinder, radar distance measurement); others measure distance using trigonometry (stadiametric rangefinders and parallax, or coincidence, rangefinders). Older methodologies that use a set of known information, usually distances or target sizes, to make the measurement, have been in regular use since the 18th century.

==Applications==

Applications includes surveying, navigation, determining focus in photography, choosing a golf club, or accurately aiming a weapon.

===Ballistics===

Rangefinders may be used by military or law enforcement snipers as a means of finding the distance to the target in order to set up a "perfect shot".Farey, Pat and Spicer, Mark (2009) Sniping: An Illustrated History Zenith Press, Grand Rapids, Michigan, page 7, ISBN 978-0-7603-3717-2 If range is not known before the first shot, it may be necessary to walk the rounds in on the target, such as using tracer ammunition or observing splashes.  The laser rangefinder is not always the best option, though, as it sends out a light source that may give away the rangefinder's position.

===Forestry===

Rangefinders are also used for surveying in forestry. Special devices with anti-leaf filters are used.

===Virtual reality===

Since the 1990s, rangefinders have been used in virtual reality systems to detect operator movements and locate objects.Kidd, Cory D. et al.
