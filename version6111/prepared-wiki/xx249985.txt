The North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball program is a college basketball program considered to be "one of the dominant basketball teams in NCAA history." The Tar Heels have won five NCAA tournament championships in 1957, 1982, 1993, 2005 and 2009, and were retroactively named the national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation for their undefeated season in 1924. The program is well known for its famous alumni, such as Michael Jordan, coaching history, and a rivalry with Duke (a team located only eight miles away in Durham, North Carolina). The rivalry is regarded as one of the most intense in all of sports.
From the Tar Heels' first season in 1910-11 through the 2008-09 season, the Tar Heels amassed a 73.8% all-time winning percentage (second highest in NCAA Division I history), winning 1,984 games and losing 703 games in 99 seasons. The Tar Heels also have the most consecutive 20-win seasons, with 31 seasons from the 1970–71 seasons through 2000–2001 season.
On January 21, 2007, North Carolina became only the second college basketball program to reach 1,900 wins in its history. The University of Kentucky was the only previous school to reach this mark. The Kansas Jayhawks have since become the third team to reach 1,900 wins.
The Tar Heels have won the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament five times, have appeared in the NCAA finals eight times, have participated in a record 18 NCAA Final Fours, have made it into the NCAA tournament 41 times (tied for second-most all-time), and hold the record for all-time NCAA Tournament victories (100). North Carolina also won the National Invitation Tournament tournament in 1971, has appeared in two NIT Semifinals, and has made five appearances in the NIT Tournament. Additionally, the team has been the number one seed in the NCAA Tournament 13 times, the latest being in 2009 (most #1 seeds all-time), and has the most consecutive top-3 ACC finishes with 37. North Carolina has had a top twenty-five final ranking among Division I schools 42 times as ranked by the Associated Press and 44 times as ranked by the Coaches Poll.  In five instances the North Carolina Tar Heels have ended the season with a number one ranking in the Associated Press, and the North Carolina Tar Heels have also been ranked number one five times at the end of the season by the Coaches' Poll. In 2008 the Tar Heels received the first unanimous preseason #1 ranking in the history of the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll, as well as the first unanimous preseason #1 ranking in the history of the Associated Press Poll.
