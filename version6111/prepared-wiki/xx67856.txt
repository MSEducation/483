==Works==

Odier is best known for the series of his pseudonymous novels which centers around an underage girl named Alba. Throughout the series, Alba engages in an unconsummated romance with an older French man, Serge Gorodish, who provides for her. Together they solve mysteries that are generally caused, at least in part, by Alba herself. The series includes the novel Diva which was later used as the basis for a popular French film of the same name.  A number of other films have been adapted from Odier's writings, including Light Years Away (from the novel, La voie sauvage) and Celestial Clockwork.Daniel Odier at IMDb.com Odier has also written many other books (such as The Rap Factor, about a detective agency in Florida) under his pseudonym.  However, the majority of Odier's fiction works, whether attributed to his own name or 'Delacorta,' remain untranslated into English.  It is commonly argued that the latter is a result of the greater part of his reception having thus far occurred in predominantly francophone milieux.
