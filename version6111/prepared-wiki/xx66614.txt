===Previous models===

====AC====

The heavy duty AC, with its well known tapered hood, was the truck which started the bulldog theme. A [tpl]convert|377|CID|L|1|abbr=on[/tpl] 4 cylinder gasoline engine 4X2 with chain drive, it was strong, reliable, and worked well in rough terrain. Introduced in 1916, there was a great demand because of World War I, over 6000 3 1/2, 5 1/2, and 7 1/2 ton trucks were built for the UK and US military. There were also commercial sales from 1916, the AC was well suited for logging and construction work. A larger version, the AP, built between 1926 and 1938, was an off-road haul truck used on Boulder dam and other large projects. 40,299 ACs had been built when production ended in 1939.

====N Series====

The N Series was Mack’s first military design, large 6 and 7 1/2 ton 6X6 artillery prime movers. Between its development in the late 1930s and the beginning of production in 1940 US military requirements changed and the truck was not needed. All NMs and most of the larger NOs were exported as foreign aid. After WWII the NO was developed into the successful M 123 semi-tractor. [tpl]sfnp|Doyle|2003|pp=205-207, 213-215[/tpl]

====B Models====

The B Models were Mack’s primary vehicle from its introduction in 1953 until it was replaced by the R Series in 1966. They ranged in size from the medium duty B20P gas powered 4X2 to the oversized B873SX turbo-diesel 6X6. B Models were commonly used as semi tractors and in the construction industry. They were also used as fire engines and trucks, sometimes with the roof of the cab removed. 127,786 B Models were built.

====R/RB/RD/RL/RM/RW, U, DM/DMM Models====

Mack started to produce the R, RW, and U models in 1966 for highway use, and the RD, DM, and all wheel drive RM and DMM Models for construction use. The lightweight RL model followed in 1967, the RW Superliner with a large, rectangular hood and grill in 1977, and the setback front axle RB in the 1990s. All these models featured the same cab; the U, DM, and DMM had the cab offset to the left.
In the 1990s, the R, RW, and U Models were discontinued and the RB was introduced, mostly for severe-duty applications. The hood was modified slightly for the model RB. 2004 was the last year for the RD, and 2006 for the RB and DM. The DM was the last model to use this cab style, and was the last model of this family to be produced.

As a replacement for the construction models, Mack started to offer the Granite, Granite Bridge-Formula and Granite Axle-back.
Also this model is serving in the Mexican Army as a Troop and Utility Truck in Configuration 6X6 OR 6X4

===Engines===

By 1916 Mack was producing 4 and 6 cylinder gasoline engines, in 2014 they continue to build their engines. Other builder’s engines were often optional, engines from Caterpillar, Cummins, Detroit Diesel, Hercules, Scania, and Waukesha have been used.
Mack started making diesels in 1938, in 1957 the END and turbocharged ENDT 673 diesel were introduced. This [tpl]convert|672|CID|L|1|abbr=on[/tpl] I6 engine family was successful, and remained in production for over 30 years.
In the early 1960s, Mack Truck's executive vice president of product and engineering, Walter May, developed the Maxidyne high-torque rise engine. The engine was introduced as an inline six in 1966, as a V8 in 1970, and as the intercooled inline six 300 series in 1973. This was an industry-changing event. The Maxidyne, with an operating range of 1200-2100 R.P.M, and later 1050-1700 R.P.M., allowed a heavy Class 8 truck to be operated with a 5 speed (Maxitorque) transmission. Previously, heavy trucks typically operated between 1800-2100R.P.M. and were equipped with 10 or more gears.
In 2014 Mack offers three engine series, the 11 L MP 7, 13 L MP8, and 16 L MP10, with [tpl]convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|605|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|1200|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|2060|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Trademark==

The company's trademark is the bulldog. It can be found on the front of almost all Mack trucks. A Mack truck with a gold-plated bulldog indicates that the entire truck is made of Mack components. Trucks with another manufacturer's transmission, engine, rear axles or suspension are given the chrome-plated bulldog.
Mack trucks earned this nickname in 1917, during World War I, when the British government purchased the Mack AC model to supply its front lines with troops, food and equipment. British soldiers dubbed the truck the "Bulldog Mack", because they said it had "the tenacity of a bulldog." Its pugnacious, blunt-nosed hood, coupled with its incredible durability, reminded the soldiers of the tenacious qualities of their country's mascot, the British Bulldog.History: 1910-1919. - Mack Trucks. - Retrieved: 2008-06-08"Mack Trucks, Inc.
