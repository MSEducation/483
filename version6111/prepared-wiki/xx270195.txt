[[Harish-Chandra's Ξ function]]

CATEGORIES: Harmonic analysis, Representation theory

In mathematical harmonic analysis, Harish-Chandra's ''Ξ'' function is a special spherical function on a semisimple Lie group, studied by [tpl]harvs|txt|last=Harish-Chandra|authorlink=Harish-Chandra|year=1966|loc=section 16[/tpl].
Harish-Chandra used it to define Harish-Chandra's Schwartz space.
[tpl]harvtxt|Wallach|1988|loc=4.5[/tpl] gives a detailed description of the properties of Ξ.
