Carl Hilding "Doc" Severinsen (born July 7, 1927) is an American pop and jazz trumpeter.  He is best known for leading the NBC Orchestra on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

==Early life==

Severinsen was born in Arlington, Oregon, the son of Minnie Mae (1897–1998) and Carl Severinsen (1898–1972), a dentist.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/42/Doc-Severinsen.html |title=Doc Severinsen Biography (1927-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-26[/tpl] Nicknamed "Little Doc" after his father, he originally wanted to play the trombone, which he discovered at neighbor Art Fletcher's home, but the senior Severinsen, a gifted amateur violinist, urged him to study that instrument instead.  The younger Severinsen insisted on the trombone, but had to settle for the only horn available in Arlington's small music store, a trumpet. A week later, with the help of his father and a manual of instructions, the seven-year-old was good enough to be invited to join the high school band.
At the age of twelve, Severinsen won the Music Educator's National Contest.  While still in high school, he was hired to go on the road with the Ted Fio Rito Orchestra. However, his stay with the group was cut short by the World War II draft. After serving in the U.S. Army, Severinsen made his broadcasting debut playing live popular music on KODL radio in The Dalles, Oregon.[tpl]cite web |publisher=RadioFreshing KODL |title=About Us |url=http://www.kodl.com/KODL/media/abotkodl.html |accessdate=April 13, 2009[/tpl]

==The Tonight Show==

Starting in 1952 during Steve Allen's tenure as host of NBC-TV's Tonight, Doc Severinsen played first trumpet in the band directed by Skitch Henderson. He actually joined "The Tonight Show Band" several months before Johnny Carson became host in October 1962. Severinsen took over as bandleader in 1967 and soon became noted for his flashy fashions.
Under Severinsen's direction, The Tonight Show NBC Orchestra became the most visible big band in America. The band played incidental music for sketch comedy, guest introductions, and intermission music during station breaks. Severinsen took the opportunity to update many well known swing music and jazz standards, including classics by Cole Porter, Dizzy Gillespie, and others.
Adept at comic interplay, Severinsen occasionally substituted for Ed McMahon as Johnny Carson's announcer and sidekick.  Severinsen campaigned for the band to get featured slots during the show. The show introduced a "Stump the Band" segment in which audience members challenged the band to play obscure song titles, with the band responding with a comic piece. 
Severinsen often cried "key of E," his signal for the band to strike up a western theme, whereupon he would enthusiastically sing a country music-flavoured nonsense song.
Tommy Newsom was frequently the band's substitute director, whenever Severinsen was away from the show or filling in for announcer Ed McMahon.
Severinsen continued as bandleader until Carson's retirement in 1992.

==Recording career==

During the 1950s and 1960s, Severinsen put out a number of albums of jazz standards, over which he performed very melodic solos.  He served as lead trumpet on many of Enoch Light's Command Records LP's of that era, and his soloing was featured in Tito Puente’s "Night Ritual (Afro Cuban Jazz Mini Suite)" from Puente's classic 1957 album Top Percussion.
Severinsen certainly had a well-developed high-note range with an incredible amount of control and melodic sense. In the 1960s, Severinsen also recorded with the Clarke/Boland Big Band and the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis band.  Severinsen was also the second trumpeter whose recording of the fanfare "Abblasen", composed by Gottfried Reiche, has been used as the theme for the CBS News program Sunday Morning.
During the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, Severinsen released several albums under the band name The Tonight Show Band with Doc Severinsen, and later receiving first billing, Doc Severinsen & The Tonight Show Band. He has also recorded with the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra.
Severinsen also released albums that have a pop rock basis, some of which include electronic instrumentation components, such as Brass Roots, Good Medicine and Facets.  These albums were received with varying degrees of success by the public.  He recorded two albums of standards with Henry Mancini and his orchestra in the 1970s, Brass On Ivory and Brass, Ivory And Strings.
Severinsen arranged the score for the nudist-themed cult film Nude on the Moon (1961). In addition, Severinsen co-wrote the Top 10 hit single "Stop and Smell the Roses" with singer-songwriter Mac Davis (1974).
