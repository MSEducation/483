[[Homogeneous function]]

CATEGORIES: Linear algebra, Differential operators, Types of functions

In mathematics, a homogeneous function is a function with multiplicative scaling behaviour: if the argument is multiplied by a factor, then the result is multiplied by some power of this factor. More precisely, if [tpl]nowrap|ƒ : V → W[/tpl] is a function between two vector spaces over a field F, and k is an integer,  then ƒ is said to be homogeneous of degree k if
for all nonzero [tpl]nowrap|α ∈ F[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|v ∈ V[/tpl]. This implies it has scale invariance. When the vector spaces involved are over the real numbers, a slightly more general form of homogeneity is often used, requiring only that ([tpl]EquationNote|1[/tpl]) hold for all α > 0. 
Homogeneous functions can also be defined for vector spaces with the origin deleted, a fact that is used in the definition of sheaves on projective space in algebraic geometry.  More generally, if S ⊂ V is any subset that is invariant under scalar multiplication by elements of the field (a "cone"), then an homogeneous function from S to W can still be defined by ([tpl]EquationNote|1[/tpl]).

==Examples==

===Linear functions===

Any linear function [tpl]nowrap|ƒ : V → W[/tpl] is homogeneous of degree 1, since by the definition of linearity
for all [tpl]nowrap|α ∈ F[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|v ∈ V[/tpl]. Similarly, any multilinear function [tpl]nowrap|ƒ : V1 × V2 × ... Vn → W[/tpl] is homogeneous of degree n, since by the definition of multilinearity
for all [tpl]nowrap|α ∈ F[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|v1 ∈ V1[/tpl], [tpl]nowrap|v2 ∈ V2[/tpl], ..., [tpl]nowrap|vn ∈ Vn[/tpl]. It follows that the n-th differential of a function [tpl]nowrap|ƒ : X → Y[/tpl] between two Banach spaces X and Y is homogeneous of degree n.

===Homogeneous polynomials===

Monomials in n variables define homogeneous functions  [tpl]nowrap|ƒ : Fn → F[/tpl]. For example,
is homogeneous of degree 10 since
The degree is the sum of the exponents on the variables; in this example, 10=5+2+3.
A homogeneous polynomial is a polynomial made up of a sum of monomials of the same degree. For example,
is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5. Homogeneous polynomials also define homogeneous functions.

===Polarization===

A multilinear function [tpl]nowrap|g : V × V × ... V → F[/tpl] from the n-th Cartesian product of V with itself to the underlying field F gives rise to an homogeneous function [tpl]nowrap|ƒ : V → F[/tpl] by evaluating on the diagonal:
The resulting function ƒ is a polynomial on the vector space V.
Conversely, if F has characteristic zero, then given an homogeneous polynomial ƒ of degree n on V, the polarization of ƒ is a multilinear function [tpl]nowrap|g : V × V × ... V → F[/tpl] on the n-th Cartesian product of V.  The polarization is defined by
These two constructions, one of an homogeneous polynomial from a multilinear form and the other of a multilinear form from an homogeneous polynomial, are mutually inverse to one another.  In finite dimensions, they establish an isomorphism of graded vector spaces from the symmetric algebra of V∗ to the algebra of homogeneous polynomials on V.

===Rational functions===

Rational functions formed as the ratio of two homogeneous polynomials are homogeneous functions off of the affine cone cut out by the zero locus of the denominator.  Thus, if f is homogeneous of degree m and g is homogeneous of degree n, then f/g is homogeneous of degree m − n away from the zeros of g.

==Positive homogeneity==

In the special case of vector spaces over the real numbers, the notation of positive homogeneity often plays a more important role than homogeneity in the above sense.  A function [tpl]nowrap|ƒ : V \ {0} → R[/tpl] is positive homogeneous of degree k if
for all [tpl]nowrap|α > 0[/tpl].  Here k can be any complex number. A (nonzero) continuous function homogeneous of degree k on Rn \ {0} extends continuously to Rn if and only if [tpl]nowrap|Re{k} > 0[/tpl].
Positive homogeneous functions are characterized by Euler's homogeneous function theorem. Suppose that the function [tpl]nowrap|ƒ : Rn \ {0} → R[/tpl] is continuously differentiable. Then ƒ is positive homogeneous of degree k if and only if
This result follows at once by differentiating both sides of the equation [tpl]nowrap|1=ƒ(αy) = αkƒ(y)[/tpl] with respect to α, applying the chain rule, and choosing [tpl]nowrap|α[/tpl] to be 1.  The converse holds by integrating. Specifically, let

==Application to differential equations==

The substitution v = y/x converts the ordinary differential equation
