[[Ununoctium]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Noble gases, Synthetic elements, Ununoctium

Ununoctium is the temporary IUPAC name[tpl]cite journal|title=Atomic weights of the elements 2005 (IUPAC Technical Report)|journal=Pure Appl. Chem.|year=2006|volume=78|issue=11|pages=2051–2066| doi=10.1351/pac200678112051| author=Wieser, M.E.[/tpl] for the transactinide element with the atomic number 118 and temporary element symbol Uuo. It is also known as eka-radon or element 118, and on the periodic table of the elements it is a p-block element and the last one of the 7th period. Ununoctium is currently the only synthetic member of group 18. It has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all the elements discovered so far.
The radioactive ununoctium atom is very unstable, due to its high mass, and since 2005, only three or possibly four atoms of the isotope 294Uuo have been detected.[tpl]cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jan/physics/article_view?b_start:int=1&-C=|title=The Top 6 Physics Stories of 2006|accessdate=2008-01-18|date=2007-01-07|publisher=Discover Magazine[/tpl] While this allowed for very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible compounds, theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions, including some unexpected ones. For example, although ununoctium is a member of Group 18, it may possibly not be a noble gas, unlike all the other Group 18 elements. It was formerly thought to be a gas but is now predicted to be a solid under normal conditions due to relativistic effects.

===Unsuccessful synthesis attempts===

In late 1998, Polish physicist Robert Smolańczuk published calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including ununoctium.[tpl]cite journal|author=Smolanczuk, R.|journal=Physical Review C|volume=59|issue=5|year=1999|title=Production mechanism of superheavy nuclei in cold fusion reactions|pages=2634–2639|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.59.2634|bibcode = 1999PhRvC..59.2634S[/tpl] His calculations suggested that it might be possible to make ununoctium by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions.
In 1999, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory made use of these predictions and announced the discovery of livermorium and ununoctium, in a paper published in Physical Review Letters,[tpl]cite journal|last=Ninov|first=Viktor|coauthors=|displayauthors=1|title=Observation of Superheavy Nuclei Produced in the Reaction of [tpl]SimpleNuclide|Link|Krypton|86[/tpl] with [tpl]SimpleNuclide|Link|Lead|208[/tpl]|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=83|pages=1104–1107|year=1999|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.1104|bibcode=1999PhRvL..83.1104N|issue=6[/tpl] and very soon after the results were reported in Science.[tpl]cite journal|author=Service, R.

The following year, they published a retraction after researchers at other laboratories were unable to duplicate the results and the Berkeley lab itself was unable to duplicate them as well.[tpl]cite news|url=http://enews.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/118-retraction.html|publisher=Berkeley Lab|author=Public Affairs Department |title=Results of element 118 experiment retracted|date=2001-07-21|accessdate=2008-01-18[/tpl] In June 2002, the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author Victor Ninov.[tpl]cite journal|pages=728–729|title=Misconduct: The stars who fell to Earth|journal=Nature|volume=420|doi=10.1038/420728a|year=2002|pmid=12490902|last1=Dalton|first1=R.|issue=6917|bibcode = 2002Natur.420..728D [/tpl]Element 118 disappears two years after it was discovered.

===Discovery reports===

The first decay of atoms of ununoctium was observed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) by Yuri Oganessian and his group in Dubna, Russia, in 2002.[tpl]cite journal|author=Oganessian, Yu.

In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the 2006 results of the Dubna-Livermore collaboration and concluded: "The three events reported for the Z = 118 isotope have very good internal
redundancy but with no anchor to known nuclei do not satisfy the criteria for discovery".[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1351/PAC-REP-10-05-01|title=Discovery of the elements with atomic numbers greater than or equal to 113 (IUPAC Technical Report)|year=2011|last1=Barber|first1=Robert C.|last2=Karol|first2=Paul J.|last3=Nakahara|first3=Hiromichi|last4=Vardaci|first4=Emanuele|last5=Vogt|first5=Erich W.|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|page=1|volume=83|issue=7[/tpl]
Because of the very small fusion reaction probability (the fusion cross section is [tpl]gaps|~|0.3–0.6|u=pb[/tpl] or [tpl]val|p=(|3|end=–6)|e=-41|u=m2[/tpl]) the experiment took four months and involved a beam dose of [tpl]val|4|e=19[/tpl] calcium ions that had to be shot at the californium target to produce the first recorded event believed to be the synthesis of ununoctium.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Uuo/key.html|title=Ununoctium|publisher=WebElements Periodic Table|accessdate=2008-01-18[/tpl] Nevertheless, researchers are highly confident that the results are not a false positive, since the chance that the detections were random events was estimated to be less than one part in [tpl]val|100000[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|quote="I would say we're very confident."|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/84/i43/8443element118.html|title=Element 118 Detected, With Confidence|publisher=Chemical and Engineering news|date=2006-10-17|accessdate=2008-01-18[/tpl]
In the experiments, the alpha-decay of three atoms of ununoctium was observed. A fourth decay by direct spontaneous fission was also proposed. A half-life of 0.89 ms was calculated: [tpl]chem|294|Uuo[/tpl] decays into [tpl]chem|link=Isotopes of livermorium#Livermorium-290|290|Lv[/tpl] by alpha decay. Since there were only three nuclei, the half-life derived from observed lifetimes has a large uncertainty: [tpl]val|0.89|+1.07|-0.31|u=ms[/tpl].
The identification of the [tpl]chem|294|Uuo[/tpl] nuclei was verified by separately creating the putative daughter nucleus [tpl]chem|290|Lv[/tpl] directly by means of a bombardment of [tpl]chem|link=curium-245|245|Cm[/tpl] with [tpl]chem|link=calcium-48|48|Ca[/tpl] ions,
and checking that the [tpl]chem|290|Lv[/tpl] decay matched the decay chain of the [tpl]chem|294|Uuo[/tpl] nuclei. The daughter nucleus [tpl]chem|290|Lv[/tpl] is very unstable, decaying with a lifetime of 14 milliseconds into [tpl]chem|link=flerovium-286|286|Fl[/tpl], which may experience either spontaneous fission or alpha decay into [tpl]chem|link=copernicium-282|282|Cn[/tpl], which will undergo spontaneous fission.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Oganessian|first1=Yu.

==Naming==

Until the 1960s ununoctium was known as eka-emanation (emanation is the old name for radon). In 1979 the IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called ununoctium,[tpl]cite journal|author=Chatt, J.|journal=Pure Appl. Chem.|year=1979|volume=51|pages=381–384|title=Recommendations for the Naming of Elements of Atomic Numbers Greater than 100|doi=10.1351/pac197951020381|issue=2[/tpl] a systematic element name, as a placeholder until the discovery of the element is confirmed and the IUPAC decides on a name.
Before the retraction in 2002, the researchers from Berkeley had intended to name the element ghiorsium (Gh), after Albert Ghiorso (a leading member of the research team).[tpl]cite web|title=Discovery of New Elements Makes Front Page News|url=http://lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1999/departments/breaking_news.shtml|publisher=Berkeley Lab Research Review Summer 1999|year=1999|accessdate=2008-01-18[/tpl]
The Russian discoverers reported their synthesis in 2006. In 2007, the head of the Russian institute stated the team were considering two names for the new element: flyorium, in honor of Georgy Flyorov, the founder of the research laboratory in Dubna; and moskovium, in recognition of the Moscow Oblast where Dubna is located.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.rin.ru/eng/news/9886/9/6/|title=New chemical elements discovered in Russia`s Science City|date=2007-02-12|accessdate=2008-02-09[/tpl] He also stated that although the element was discovered as an American collaboration, who provided the californium target, the element should rightly be named in honor of Russia since the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions at JINR was the only facility in the world which could achieve this result.[tpl]cite web|last=Yemel'yanova|language=Russian|first=Asya |date=2006-12-17|url=http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=113947|title=118-й элемент назовут по-русски (118th element will be named in Russian)|publisher=vesti.ru|accessdate=2008-01-18[/tpl] These names were later proposed for element 114 (flerovium) and element 116 (moscovium).[tpl]cite web|publisher=rian.ru|year=2011|accessdate=2011-05-08|url=http://ria.ru/science/20110326/358081075.html|title=Российские физики предложат назвать 116 химический элемент московием (Russian Physicians Will Suggest to Name Element 116 Moscovium)|language=Russian[/tpl] However, the final name proposed for element 116 was instead livermorium.[tpl]cite web|title=News: Start of the Name Approval Process for the Elements of Atomic Number 114 and 116|url=http://www.iupac.org/news/news-detail/article/start-of-the-name-approval-process-for-the-elements-of-atomic-number-114-and-116.html|work=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|accessdate=2 December 2011[/tpl]
No name has yet been officially suggested for the element as no claims for discovery have yet been accepted by the IUPAC. According to current guidelines from IUPAC, the ultimate name for all new elements should end in "-ium", which means the name for ununoctium will almost certainly end in "-ium", not "-on", even if ununoctium turns out to be a noble gas, which traditionally have names ending in "-on" (with the exception of helium, which was not known to be a noble gas when it was discovered).[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac200274050787|url=http://media.iupac.org/publications/pac/2002/pdf/7405x0787.pdf|title=Naming of new elements (IUPAC Recommendations 2002)|year=2002|author=Koppenol, W.

==Characteristics==

===Nucleus stability and isotopes===

The stability of nuclei decreases greatly with the increase in atomic number after plutonium, the heaviest primordial element, so that all isotopes with an atomic number above 101 decay radioactively with a half-life under a day, with an exception of dubnium-268. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after lead) have stable isotopes.[tpl]cite journal|last = Marcillac|first = Pierre de|coauthors = Noël Coron, Gérard Dambier, Jacques Leblanc, and Jean-Pierre Moalic|date=April 2003|title = Experimental detection of α-particles from the radioactive decay of natural bismuth|journal = Nature|volume = 422|pages = 876–878|pmid=12712201|doi = 10.1038/nature01541|issue = 6934|bibcode = 2003Natur.422..876D[/tpl] Nevertheless, because of reasons not very well understood yet, there is a slight increased nuclear stability around atomic numbers 110–114, which leads to the appearance of what is known in nuclear physics as the "island of stability". This concept, proposed by University of California professor Glenn Seaborg, explains why superheavy elements last longer than predicted.[tpl]cite book|title=Van Nostrand's scientific encyclopedia|first1=Glenn D. |last1= Considine |first2=Peter H. |last2= Kulik|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=2002|edition=9|isbn=978-0-471-33230-5|oclc=223349096[/tpl] Ununoctium is radioactive and has a half-life that appears to be less than a millisecond. Nonetheless, this is still longer than some predicted values,[tpl]cite journal|title=Heaviest nuclei from 48Ca-induced reactions|first=Yu.

Calculations using a quantum-tunneling model predict the existence of several neutron-rich isotopes of ununoctium with alpha-decay half-lives close to 1 ms.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Physical Reviews C|volume=77|page=044603|year=2008|title=Search for long lived heaviest nuclei beyond the valley of stability|first1=Roy P.|last1=Chowdhury |first2=C. |last2=Samanta |first3= D.

Theoretical calculations done on the synthetic pathways for, and the half-life of, other isotopes have shown that some could be slightly more stable than the synthesized isotope 294Uuo, most likely 293Uuo, 295Uuo, 296Uuo, 297Uuo, 298Uuo, 300Uuo and 302Uuo.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=730|year=2004|pages=355–376|title=Entrance channels and alpha decay half-lives of the heaviest elements|first1=G. |last1=Royer|first2= K. |last2=Zbiri|first3 =C. |last3=Bonilla|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.010|arxiv = nucl-th/0410048 |bibcode = 2004NuPhA.730..355R|issue=3–4[/tpl] Of these, 297Uuo might provide the best chances for obtaining longer-lived nuclei,[tpl]cite journal|journal=Phys.

===Calculated atomic and physical properties===

Ununoctium is a member of group 18, the zero-valence elements. The members of this group are usually inert to most common chemical reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound.[tpl]cite web|last=Bader|first=Richard F.W|url=http://miranda.chemistry.mcmaster.ca/esam/|title=An Introduction to the Electronic Structure of Atoms and Molecules|publisher=McMaster University|accessdate=2008-01-18[/tpl] It is thought that similarly, ununoctium has a closed outer valence shell in which its valence electrons are arranged in a 7s27p6 configuration.
Consequently, some expect ununoctium to have similar physical and chemical properties to other members of its group, most closely resembling the noble gas above it in the periodic table, radon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/Uuo-en.htm|title=Ununoctium (Uuo) – Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects|publisher=Lenntech|accessdate=2008-01-18|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080116172028/http://lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/Uuo-en.htm |archivedate = January 16, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Following the periodic trend, ununoctium would be expected to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be quite reactive, so that it probably cannot be considered a noble gas.[tpl]cite book|title=Theoretical Chemistry and Physics of Heavy and Superheavy Elements|first1=Uzi|last1=Kaldor|first2=Stephen|last2=Wilson|page=105|year=2003|publisher=Springer|isbn=1-4020-1371-X[/tpl] In addition to being far more reactive than radon, ununoctium may be even more reactive than elements flerovium and copernicium.[tpl]cite journal|title=Atomic and Molecular Properties of Elements 112, 114, and 118|first=Clinton S.|last=Nash|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry A|year=2005|volume=109|issue=15|pages=3493–3500|doi=10.1021/jp050736o|pmid=16833687|last1=Nash|first1=CS[/tpl] The reason for the apparent enhancement of the chemical activity of ununoctium relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-subshell.[tpl]efn|The actual quote is "The reason for the apparent enhancement of chemical activity of element 118 relative to radon is the energetic destabilization and radial expansion of its occupied 7p3/2 spinor shell."[/tpl] More precisely, considerable spin–orbit interactions between the 7p electrons with the inert 7s2 electrons, effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and a significant decrease in stabilization of the closed shell of element 118. It has also been calculated that ununoctium, unlike other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy—or in other words, it exhibits positive electron affinity.[tpl]cite journal|title=QED corrections to the binding energy of the eka-radon (Z=118) negative ion|first1=Igor|last1=Goidenko|first2=Leonti|last2=Labzowsky|first3=Ephraim|last3=Eliav|first4=Uzi|last4=Kaldor|first5= Pekka |last5=Pyykko¨|journal=Physical Review A|volume=67|year=2003|pages=020102(R)|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.67.020102|bibcode = 2003PhRvA..67b0102G|issue=2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|volume=77|issue=27|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=1996|title=Element 118: The First Rare Gas with an Electron Affinity|first1=Ephraim |last1=Eliav |first2=Uzi |last2=Kaldor|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.5350|pages=5350–5352|pmid=10062781|last3=Ishikawa|first3=Y|last4=Pyykkö|first4=P |bibcode=1996PhRvL..77.5350E[/tpl][tpl]efn|Nevertheless, quantum electrodynamic corrections have been shown to be quite significant in reducing this affinity by decreasing the binding in the anion Uuo− by 9%, thus confirming the importance of these corrections in superheavy elements. See Pyykkö.[/tpl]
Ununoctium is expected to have by far the broadest polarizability of all elements before it in the periodic table, and almost twofold of radon. By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it is expected that ununoctium has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This is very different from the previously estimated values of 263 K[tpl]cite book|title=Modern Alchemy|authorlink=Glenn Theodore Seaborg|first=Glenn Theodore|last=Seaborg|year=1994|isbn=981-02-1440-5|publisher=World Scientific|page =172[/tpl] or 247 K.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=251|issue=2|year=2002|pages=299–301|title=Boiling points of the superheavy elements 117 and 118|first=N. |last=Takahashi|doi=10.1023/A:1014880730282[/tpl] Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that ununoctium would be a gas under standard conditions,[tpl]efn|It is debatable if the name of the group "noble gases" will be changed if ununoctium is shown to be non-volatile.[/tpl] and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be solid at standard conditions. If ununoctium forms a gas under standard conditions nevertheless, it would be one of the densest gaseous substances at standard conditions (even if it is monatomic like the other noble gases).
Because of its tremendous polarizability, ununoctium is expected to have an anomalously low ionization energy (similar to that of lead which is 70% of that of radon and significantly smaller than that of flerovium[tpl]cite journal|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry A|volume=1999|issue=3|pages=402–410|title=Spin-Orbit Effects, VSEPR Theory, and the Electronic Structures of Heavy and Superheavy Group IVA Hydrides and Group VIIIA Tetrafluorides.

===Predicted compounds===

No compounds of ununoctium have been synthesized yet, but calculations on theoretical compounds have been performed since 1964.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(65)80255-X|year=1965|publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd.|title=Some physical and chemical properties of element 118 (Eka-Em) and element 86 (Em)|first=A. V.|last=Grosse|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=27|issue=3|pages=509–19[/tpl] It is expected that if the ionization energy of the element is high enough, it will be difficult to oxidize and therefore, the most common oxidation state will be 0 (as for other noble gases);[tpl]cite web|publisher=WebElements Periodic Table|url=http://webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Uuo/comp.html|title=Ununoctium: Binary Compounds|accessdate=2008-01-18[/tpl] nevertheless, this appears not to be the case.
Calculations on the diatomic molecule [tpl]chem|Uuo|2[/tpl] showed a bonding interaction roughly equivalent to that calculated for [tpl]chem|Hg|2[/tpl], and a dissociation energy of 6 kJ/mol, roughly 4 times of that of [tpl]chem|Rn|2[/tpl]. But most strikingly, it was calculated to have a bond length shorter than in [tpl]chem|Rn|2[/tpl] by 0.16 Å, which would be indicative of a significant bonding interaction. On the other hand, the compound UuoH+ exhibits a dissociation energy (in other words proton affinity of Uuo) that is smaller than that of RnH+.
The bonding between ununoctium and hydrogen in UuoH is predicted to be very limp and can be regarded as a pure van der Waals interaction rather than a true chemical bond. On the other hand, with highly electronegative elements, ununoctium seems to form more stable compounds than for example copernicium or flerovium. The stable oxidation states +2 and +4 have been predicted to exist in the fluorides [tpl]chem|Uuo||F|2[/tpl] and [tpl]chem|Uuo||F|4[/tpl].[tpl]cite journal|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry A|volume=103|issue=8|pages=1104–1108|year=1999|title=Structures of RgFn (Rg = Xe, Rn, and Element 118. n = 2, 4.) Calculated by Two-component Spin-Orbit Methods. A Spin-Orbit Induced Isomer of (118)F4|first1=Young-Kyu|last1=Han|first2=Yoon Sup|last2=Lee|doi=10.1021/jp983665k[/tpl] The +6 state would be less stable due to the strong binding of the 7p1/2 subshell.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Fricke |first1=Burkhard |year=1975 |title=Superheavy elements: a prediction of their chemical and physical properties |journal=Recent Impact of Physics on Inorganic Chemistry |volume=21 |pages=89–144 |doi=10.1007/BFb0116498 |url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/225672062_Superheavy_elements_a_prediction_of_their_chemical_and_physical_properties |accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl] This is a result of the same spin-orbit interactions that make ununoctium unusually reactive. For example, it was shown that the reaction of ununoctium with [tpl]chem|F|2[/tpl] to form the compound [tpl]chem|Uuo||F|2[/tpl] would release an energy of 106 kcal/mol of which about 46 kcal/mol come from these interactions. For comparison, the spin-orbit interaction for the similar molecule [tpl]chem|Rn||F|2[/tpl] is about 10 kcal/mol out of a formation energy of 49 kcal/mol. The same interaction stabilizes the tetrahedral Td configuration for [tpl]chem|Uuo||F|4[/tpl], as distinct from the square planar D4h one of [tpl]chem|Xe||F|4[/tpl] which [tpl]chem|Rn||F|4[/tpl] is also expected to have. The Uuo–F bond will most probably be ionic rather than covalent, rendering the UuoFn compounds non-volatile.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, ChemicalCommunications|year=1975|pages=760–761|doi=10.1039/C3975000760b|title=Fluorides of radon and element 118|first =Kenneth S.|last = Pitzer|issue=18[/tpl] UuoF2 is predicted to be partially ionic due to ununoctium's high electropositivity.[tpl]cite web|author=Seaborg|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/603220/transuranium-element|title=transuranium element (chemical element)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=c. 2006|accessdate=2010-03-16[/tpl] Unlike the other noble gases (except possibly xenon),[tpl]cite book|title=《无机化学丛书》第一卷：稀有气体、氢、碱金属|pages=P72|author=张青莲|isbn=7-03-002238-6|location=Beijing|publisher=Science Press|date=November 1991[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Proserpio, Davide M.; Hoffmann, Roald; Janda, Kenneth C.|title=The xenon-chlorine conundrum: van der Waals complex or linear molecule?|year=1991|volume=113|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|issue=19|page=7184|doi=10.1021/ja00019a014[/tpl] ununoctium was predicted to be sufficiently electropositive to form a Uuo–Cl bond with chlorine.
