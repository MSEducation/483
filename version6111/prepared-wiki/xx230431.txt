The protagonist, 'Egmo' is an ill-fated anti hero whose many eccentricities put him firmly out of step with the world and everyone in it. When he unearths the global domination plans of local would-be-criminal-mastermind Krapodkin he sets out on a fantastical mission to restore relative normality.

==Critical reception==

The Story of Egmo achieved national recognition from The Independent, N.U.T. magazine and Viz.

==Radio Serialisation==

In 2010/2011 The Story of Egmo was serialised by Saint FM, narrated by Ben Cormack. The series divided listeners: whilst some feedback suggested it was among the very best programming of that genre, one listener complained that it was completely incomprehensible. In general the series was critically very well received and attracted a large audience. The station re-ran the series in its entirety in 2011.
