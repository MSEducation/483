The Stöffl Hut ([tpl]lang-de|Stöfflhütte[/tpl]) is a mountain hut at the foot of the Wilder Kaiser in the Austrian state of Tyrol.

==Location==

The hut lies at a height of [tpl]Höhe|1170|AT|link=true[/tpl] in an alpine pasture known as the Walleralm. It is an easy stroll from Lake Hinterstein but may also be used as meal stop (Jausenstation) for a range of hiking and climbing tours around the Wilder Kaiser.

==History==

The Stöffl Hut was built over 350 years ago on the Walleralm. In summer the local alp is traditionally farmed (for cattle and the production of cheese, etc.); in recent years it has become a focal point for hikers and walkers.

==Facilities==

During the summer months the Stöffl Hut is run by the Bichler family from Schwoich and is a popular stop for hikers, walkers and mountain bikers.
