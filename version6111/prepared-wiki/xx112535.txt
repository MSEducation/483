Alfred Kazin (June 5, 1915 – June 5, 1998) was an American writer and literary critic, many of whose writings depicted the immigrant experience in early twentieth century America.

==Early life==

Like many of the other New York Intellectuals, Alfred Kazin was a Jew[tpl]cite news|last=Garner|first=Dwight|title=A Lifetime of Anxiety and Lust|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/books/alfred-kazins-journals-review.html?ref=books|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 26, 2011[/tpl] born in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and a graduate of the City College of New York. However, his politics were more moderate than most of the New York Intellectuals, many of whom were socialists.

==Career==

Kazin was deeply affected by his peers' subsequent disillusion with liberalism. Adam Kirsch writes in The New Republic that "having invested his romantic self-image in liberalism, Kazin perceived abandonment of liberalism by his peers as an attack on his identity".[tpl]cite news | last = Kirsch |first = Adam | title = The Inner Clamor| url = http://www.tnr.com/article/books/magazine/96704/kazin-journals-criticism-literature-america?passthru=NzFmMWJjZDJmZmNjMGRlZTc0MDI2NjQ3N2UwOWQ0OGU | work = The New Republic | date = October 26, 2011|accessdate=17 August 2012[/tpl]
He wrote out of a great passion—or great disgust—for what he was reading and embedded his opinions in a deep knowledge of history, both literary history and politics and culture. In 1996 he was awarded the first Truman Capote Lifetime Achievement Award in Literary Criticism, which carries a cash reward of $100,000.[tpl]cite news|title=First Capote Award Goes to Alfred Kazin|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/10/books/first-capote-award-goes-to-alfred-kazin.html|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 10, 1996[/tpl] The only other person to have won the award is George Steiner.
