Street Angel is a 1928 silent film, directed by Frank Borzage, about a spirited young woman (Janet Gaynor) who finds herself involved in illegal ways of gaining money to help pay for her ill mother's medicine. She is caught in the act, runs away from punishment, and finds her mother dead. Destitute and on the streets she joins a traveling carnival, where she meets a vagabond painter (Charles Farrell). Though they fall in love, her past won't leave her alone... The movie was adapted by H.H. Caldwell (titles), Katherine Hilliker (titles), Philip Klein, Marion Orth and Henry Roberts Symonds from the play Lady Cristilinda by Monckton Hoffe.
Street Angel was one of three movies for which Janet Gaynor received an Academy Award for Best Actress in 1929; the others were F. W. Murnau's Sunrise and Borzage's Seventh Heaven. Street Angel was also nominated for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography.[tpl]cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/112027/Street-Angel/details |title=NY Times: Street Angel |accessdate=2008-12-06|work=NY Times[/tpl] The acting award was given in 1929 and the other two in 1930, which accords the movie the distinction of being the only film to ever receive an Oscar nomination in two different years that was not a foreign language film.
