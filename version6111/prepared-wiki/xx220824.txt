===Athletics===

Penn-Trafford participates in the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (WPIAL).[tpl]cite news |last=Barnes |first=Keith |title=Penn-Trafford to play for first PIAA title |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/highschool/s_538277.html |publisher=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2008-04-12 |quote=The Lady Warriors were the third seed from the WPIAL after losing to Seneca Valley in the semifinals, but they recovered with victories against District 10 champion Erie McDowell, a Peters Township team that had defeated them, 9-1, in the South Park Kickoff Tournament and Mount Lebanon after losing, 1-0, to the Lady Blue Devils in the season opener. [/tpl] The colors are Dartmouth Green and Green Bay Gold.  The nickname of the school's teams are the Warriors or Lady Warriors, depending on gender. In keeping with the native American theme of the two high schools that merged to form Penn-Trafford, Warriors was chosen. The nickname of Penn Joint High School (a predecessor to Penn-Trafford) was the Indians. The nickname of Trafford High School (a predecessor to Penn-Trafford) was the Tomahawks. In 1971-1972, prior to the merger of the two high schools, a panel of eight students, four from each high school met to develop the new school nickname and color-schemes. The student body of each school were given the task of voting on the new school colors from three color-scheme options chosen by the student panel, Kelly Green and Green Bay Gold being one of them. The color-scheme options were selected by the panel to differentiate Penn-Trafford from the other Keystone Conference member schools. The top vote getter was Green and Gold. Dartmouth Green eventually replaced Kelly Green.Bucar, Paul - Date: 2010-08-18. One of the original eight student panel members representing the Trafford high school sophomore class.
Marching Band
When Penn High School and Trafford High School merged to form Penn-Trafford, the Marching Band used both the Penn and Trafford uniforms. The band was under the direction of Emery Toth.  The band soon became one of the most respected bands in the county.  Toth directed the band from 1972-1986. The marching band would be known as "The Big Green Machine" during these years. The Big Green Machine became a well known marching band and became particularly famous for their green uniforms. When Toth decided to leave the high school, his replacement was former Assistant Director, Tom Monteleone. The band then became the Warrior Marching Band. Over the next few years, the band would become more involved in competitions where Toth had left off.  Monteleone retired after the 2009 marching season and was replaced by David Cornelius, who previously directed the Elizabeth Forward Marching Band. On Monday, December 7, P-T school directors named Cornelius the new PTHS Band Director. In 2011, P-T hosted a band show dedicated to the founding director, Emery Toth. 
The band has placed third in the "Quad-A" (AAAA) class of PIMBA (Pennsylvania Interscholastic Marching Band Association) championships for several years running. In 2012, championships will be held at Penn-Trafford.

==Notable Sponsors & Alumni==

Following his retirement and until his death, Alistair Cooke was a frequent and generous donor to the high school.  His support was based on a long friendship with a former Social Studies teacher at the school (Ray Edelman).  Cooke referred to the school's education  as "effective, efficient, and quality" which was later adopted as the district's motto.  Plans are currently being discussed by the school board to rename the school's library in his honor http://penntrafford.org/minutes_6_8.pdf
