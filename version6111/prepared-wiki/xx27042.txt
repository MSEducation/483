The demographics of Australia covers basic statistics, most populous cities, ethnicity and religion. The population of Australia is estimated to be [tpl]formatnum:[tpl]#expr: 23423930 + (86400 / 78) * [tpl]Age in days|2014|3|21[/tpl] round 0[/tpl][/tpl] as of [tpl]CURRENTDAY[/tpl] [tpl]CURRENTMONTHNAME[/tpl] [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/1647509ef7e25faaca2568a900154b63?OpenDocument|title=Population clock|work=Australian Bureau of Statistics website|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=21 March 2014[/tpl] The population estimate shown is automatically calculated daily at 00:00 UTC and is based on data obtained from the population clock on the date shown in the citation. Australia is the 52nd most populous country in the world. Its population is concentrated mainly in urban areas and is expected to exceed 28 million by 2030.[tpl]cite news|title=Australia's population to hit 28 million by 2031: report|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/7231093.html|accessdate=24 April 2013|newspaper=People's Daily Online|date=14 December 2010|author=Xinhua[/tpl]
Australia's population has grown from an estimated population of about 350,000 at the time of British settlement in 1788 due to numerous waves of immigration during the period since. Also due to immigration, the European component of the population is declining as a percentage, as it is in many other Western countries.
Australia has scarcely more than two persons per square kilometre of total land area. With 89% of its population living in urban areas, Australia is one of the world's most urbanised countries.[tpl]cite web|title=Data – Australia|url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/australia|work=The World Bank|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=24 April 2013|year=2013[/tpl] The life expectancy of Australia in 1999–2001 was 79.7 years, among the highest in the world.

==Indigenous population==

The earliest  accepted timeline for the first arrivals of  indigenous Australians to the continent of Australia places this human migration to at least 40,000 years ago most probably from the islands of Indonesia and New Guinea.[tpl]cite web|url=http://media.uow.edu.au/news/2004/0917a/index.html|title=When did Australia’s earliest inhabitants arrive?|publisher=University of Wollongong|date=17 September 2004|accessdate=3 January 2009[/tpl]
These first inhabitants of Australia were originally hunter-gatherers, who over the course of many succeeding generations diversified widely throughout the continent and its nearby islands. Although their technical culture remained static—depending on wood, bone, and stone tools and weapons—their spiritual and social life was highly complex. Most spoke several languages, and confederacies sometimes linked widely scattered tribal groups. Aboriginal population density ranged from approximately one person per [tpl]convert|1|sqmi|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip|sigfig=1[/tpl] along the coasts to one person per [tpl]convert|35|sqmi|km2|disp=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on[/tpl] in the arid interior. Food procurement was usually a matter for the nuclear family, requiring an estimated 3 days of work per week. There was little large game, and outside of some communities in the more fertile south-east, they had no agriculture.
Dutch navigators landed on the coasts of modern Western Australia and Queensland several times during the 17th century. Captain James Cook claimed the east coast for Great Britain in 1770, the west coast was later settled by Britain also. At that time, the indigenous population was estimated to have been between 315,000 and 750,000,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/68AE74ED632E17A6CA2573D200110075?opendocument|title=Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Population|work=1301.0 – Year Book Australia, 2008|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=7 February 2008|accessdate=3 January 2009[/tpl] divided into as many as 500 tribes[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl] speaking many different languages. In the 2011 Census, 495,757 respondents declared they were Aboriginal, 31,407 declared they were Torres Strait Islander, and a further 21,206 declared they were both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.[tpl]Census 2011 AUS|id=0|name=Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples (Indigenous) Profile|accessdate=9 October 2013[/tpl]
Since the end of World War II, efforts have been made both by the government and by the public to be more responsive to Aboriginal rights and needs. Today, many tribal Aborigines lead a settled traditional life in remote areas of northern, central and western Australia. In the south, where most Aborigines are of mixed descent, most Aboriginal people live in the cities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Cities==

Australia contains five cities that consist of over one million people, which is significant for a small population.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Population density==

Higher population densities can be seen throughout the major cities which are throughout Australia. The population density in Australia was last reported as [tpl]convert|2.91|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]. The density was [tpl]convert|2.8|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] in 2008 and [tpl]convert|2.86|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] in 2009. That made Australia the 3rd least densely populated country in the world, after Namibia and Mongolia.

==General demographic statistics==

Much of the data that follows has been derived from the CIA World Factbook and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, through censuses.

===Population growth rate===

As of the end of September 2012, the population growth rate was 1.7%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/3101.0|title=3101.0 – Australian Demographic Statistics, September 2012 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=17 April 2013|accessdate=18 April 2013[/tpl] This rate was based on estimates of:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs%40.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/1647509ef7e25faaca2568a900154b63?OpenDocument|title=Population clock|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=18 April 2013[/tpl]
In 2009, the estimated rates were:
At the time of Australian Federation in 1901, the rate of natural increase was 14.9 persons per 1,000 population. The rate increased to a peak of 17.4 per thousand population in the years 1912, 1913 and 1914. During the Great Depression, the rate declined to a low of 7.1 per thousand population in 1934 and 1935. Immediately after World War II, the rate increased sharply as a result of the start of the post–World War II baby boom and the immigration of many young people who then had children in Australia. A rate plateau of over 13.0 persons per 1,000 population occurred for every year from 1946 to 1962.
There has been a fall in the rate of natural increase since 1962 due to falling fertility. In 1971, the rate of natural increase was 12.7 persons per 1,000 population; a decade later it had fallen to 8.5. In 1996 the rate of natural increase fell below seven for the first time, with the downward trend continuing in the late 1990s.  Population projections by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that continued low fertility, combined with the increase in deaths from an ageing population, will result in natural increase falling below zero sometime in the mid-2030s. However, in 2006 the fertility rate rose to 1.81, one of  the highest rate in the OECD, arguably as a result of some pro-fertility state and federal government campaigns, including the Federal Government's baby bonus.
Since 1901, the crude death rate has fallen from about 12.2 deaths per 1,000 population, to 6.4 deaths per 1,000 population in 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/72097B9A70C71596CA2573D20010FD0A?opendocument|title=Population Size and Growth|work=1301.0 – Year Book Australia, 2008|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=7 February 2008|accessdate=3 January 2009[/tpl]

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in mid-2006 there were 4,956,863 residents who were born outside Australia, representing 24% of the total population.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/E0A79B147EA8E0B5CA2572AC001813E8/$File/34120_2005-06.pdf|title=Migration|page=48|work=2006 Census|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|format=PDF|date=29 March 2007|accessdate=6 June 2011[/tpl] (table 6.6) The Australian-resident population consists of people who were born in these countries:

===Religion===

Australia is a religiously diverse country and it has no official religion.
Christianity is the predominant faith of Australia, although its popularity is diminishing. According to the 2011 census, 61.1% of the population classified themselves as being affiliated with a Christian faith, down from 67.3% ten years earlier at the 2001 census.[tpl]Census 2011 AUS|id=0|name=Time Series Profile|accessdate=26 April 2014[/tpl] The largest religious denomination was Roman Catholicism, with 25.3% of the population. The next largest Christian denomination was Anglican at 17.1%, and all other Christian denominations accounted for a further 18.7% of the population.[tpl]Census 2011 AUS |id=0|name=Australia|accessdate=26 April 2014|quick=on[/tpl] 
The second-largest group, and the one which had grown the fastest, was the 22.3% who claimed to have no religion. Over the ten years since the 2001 census, this group grew from 15.3% to 22.3% of the population; an increase of 7%, which was the largest change of any religious classification in that period.
Minority religions practiced in Australia include Buddhism (2.5% of the population), Islam (2.2%), Hinduism (1.3%) and Judaism (0.5%). The Census question about religion is optional, and 8.6% of people did not respond.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics 2001 Census Dictionary statement on religious affiliation states the purpose for gathering such information:
Data on religious affiliation are used for such purposes as planning educational facilities, aged persons' care and other social services provided by religion-based organisations; the location of church buildings; the assigning of chaplains to hospitals, prisons, armed services and universities; the allocation of time on public radio and other media; and sociological research.
As in many Western countries, the level of active participation in religious services is lower than would be indicated by the proportion of the population identifying themselves as affiliated with a religion; weekly attendance at Christian church services is about 1.5 million, or about 7.5% of the population.[tpl]cite web|title=NCLS releases latest estimates of church attendance|url=http://www.ncls.org.au/default.aspx?docid=2250&track=82083|work=NCLS Research|publisher=NCLS Research|accessdate=24 April 2013|format=Media release|date=28 February 2012[/tpl] Christian charitable organisations, hospitals and schools play a prominent role in welfare and education services. The Catholic education system is the second biggest sector after government schools, with more than 650,000 students (and around 21 per cent of all secondary school enrolments).

===Languages===

English is the national language of Australia and is spoken by the vast majority of the population.
The most commonly spoken languages other than English are Italian, Greek, German, Spanish, Vietnamese, Filipino, Chinese languages, Indian languages, Arabic and Macedonian, as well as numerous Australian Aboriginal languages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Australia |title=Ethnologue report for Australia |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=7 September 2010[/tpl] Australia's hearing-impaired community uses Australian Deaf Sign Language. As of February 2012, more than 15 per cent of Australians speak non-English languages at home and more than 200 languages are practised.[tpl]cite web|title=People, culture and lifestyle|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/people_culture.html|work=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|publisher=The Australian Government|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=February 2012[/tpl]

==Historical population estimates==

Note that population estimates in the table below do not include the Aboriginal population before 1961. Estimates of Aboriginal population prior to European settlement range from 300,000 to one million, with archaeological finds indicating a sustainable population of around 750,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad45ff1425ca25682000192af2/bfc28642d31c215cca256b350010b3f4!OpenDocument|work=1301.0 – Year Book Australia, 2002|title=Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population|date=20 August 2007|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=21 October 2009[/tpl]
