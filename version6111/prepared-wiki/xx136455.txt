"The Thin Wall" is Ultravox's first single from the Rage in Eden album, recorded in Conny Plankâ€™s Studio in Cologne, Germany and released on Chrysalis Records on 14 August 1981.
The music video, directed by Russell Mulcahy, features Midge Ure struggling to cope among strange and nightmarish imagery, similar to a haunted house setting, while the other band members seemingly plot his demise.
The song is a fast and stark synth melody with obscure lyrics like many Ultravox songs and New Romantic music in general. It peaked at #14 in the UK Single Charts.
There is no extended version of "The Thin Wall" unlike other Ultravox singles; the A-side on the 12" is identical to the album version, while the 7" version is an edit.
