[[List of highest-grossing films]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of highest-grossing films, Record progressions

Films generate income from several revenue streams including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising. However, theatrical box office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications (such as Box Office Mojo and Variety) in assessing the success of a film, mostly due to the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, and also due to historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.
Traditionally, war films, musicals and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been the best performers in the 21st century, with films from the Harry Potter, Middle-Earth and Pirates of the Caribbean series dominating the top end of the list. There has also been new interest in the superhero genre; Superman and Batman from DC Comics and films based on the Marvel Comics brand such as Spider-Man, X-Men and films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have all done particularly well. The only films in the top ten that do not form a franchise are the top two, Avatar and Titanic, both directed by James Cameron, and Disney's Frozen. Animated family films have performed consistently well, with Disney films enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home video era. Disney also enjoyed later success with its Pixar brand, of which the Toy Story films and Finding Nemo have been the best performers; beyond Pixar animation, the Shrek, Ice Age, Madagascar and Despicable Me series have met with the most success.
While inflation has eroded away the achievements of most films from the 1960s and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active: James Bond and Star Trek films are still being released periodically, and the Star Wars saga was reprised after a lengthy hiatus; Indiana Jones also saw a successful comeback after lying dormant for nearly twenty years. All four are still among the highest-grossing franchises, despite starting over thirty years ago. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses even by today's standards, but do not really compete against today's top-earners: Gone with the Wind for instance—which was the highest-grossing film for twenty-five years—does not even make the top fifty in the modern market, but, adjusted for inflation, it would still be the highest-grossing film. All grosses on the list are expressed in US dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.

==Highest-grossing films==

With a worldwide box-office gross of about $2.8 billion, Avatar is often proclaimed to be the "highest-grossing" film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take account of home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings. Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[tpl]cite journal |first=Zachary |last=Pincus-Roth |title=Producers claim prod'n has grossed over $3.2 bil at the B.O. worldwide |work=Variety |url=http://variety.com/2006/legit/news/movies-aren-t-the-only-b-o-monsters-1117935611/ |date=January 8, 2006 |accessdate=February 2, 2014[/tpl] in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters. While complete sales data is not available for Avatar, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[tpl]cite web |title=Avatar – Video Sales |work=The Numbers |publisher=Nash Information Services |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Avatar#tab=video-sales |accessdate=November 12, 2013[/tpl] and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[tpl]cite news |title=Unkind unwind |date=March 17, 2011 |work=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18386456 |accessdate=April 12, 2012[/tpl] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion. Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film's earnings, with a film often earning as much as 20–25% of its theatrical box-office for a couple of television runs on top of pay-per-view revenues;[tpl]cite book |last=Vogel |first=Harold L. |year=2010 |title=Entertainment Industry Economics: A Guide for Financial Analysis |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-00309-5 |page=224 |quote=Most pictures would likely receive 20% to 25% of theatrical box office gross for two prime-time network runs.[/tpl] Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights, equating to about 9% of its North American gross.
When a film is highly exploitable as a commercial property, its ancillary revenues from merchandising can dwarf its income from direct film sales.[tpl]cite news |last=Clark |first=Emma |title=How films make money |date=November 12, 2001 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1646640.stm |accessdate=April 12, 2012[/tpl] Pixar's Cars earned $461 million in theatrical revenues[tpl]cite web |title=Cars (2006) |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=cars.htm |accessdate=April 12, 2012[/tpl]—which was only a modest hit by comparison to other Pixar films[tpl]cite web |title=Pixar – Worldwide (Unadjusted) |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=pixar.htm |accessdate=April 12, 2012[/tpl]—but generated global merchandise sales of over $8 billion in the five years after its 2006 release,[tpl]cite news |first=Georg |last=Szalai |title=Disney: 'Cars' Has Crossed $8 Billion in Global Retail Sales |date=February 14, 2011 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-cars-has-crossed-8-99438 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110319190512/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-cars-has-crossed-8-99438|archivedate=March 19, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last1=Chmielewski |first1=Dawn C. |last2=Keegan |first2=Rebecca |title=Merchandise sales drive Pixar's 'Cars' franchise |date=June 21, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/21/business/la-fi-ct-cars2-20110621 |accessdate=April 12, 2012[/tpl] the most revenue ever generated by a franchise consisting of a single film.
Only the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value are included here, which sees Avatar rank in the top position. Eighteen films in total have grossed in excess of $1 billion worldwide. The films on this chart have all had a theatrical run (including re-releases) since 1996, and films that have not played since then do not appear on the chart due to ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.

==Highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation==

Due to the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[tpl]cite news|last=Bialik |first=Carl |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/how-hollywood-box-office-records-are-made-889/ |title=How Hollywood Box-Office Records Are Made |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 29, 2010 |accessdate=August 9, 2011[/tpl] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[tpl]cite news|last=Pincus-Roth |first=Zachary |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/summer_movies/2009/07/best_weekend_never.single.html |title=Best Weekend Never |work=Slate |date=July 6, 2009 |accessdate=August 10, 2011[/tpl] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practise fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970 tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars.[tpl]cite conference |first1=S. Eric |last1=Anderson |first2=Stewart |last2=Albertson |first3=David |last3=Shavlick |title=How the motion picture industry miscalculates box office receipts |conference=Proceedings of the Midwest Business Economics Association |date=March 2004 |publisher=Loma Linda University |url=http://www.usi.edu/business/abe/2004/movies.doc |conferenceurl=http://www.usi.edu/business/abe/2004.aspx |format=DOC |accessdate=April 8, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/3582132/How-the-motion-picture-industry-miscalculates-box-office-receipts |archivedate=August 10, 2011 |deadurl=no[/tpl] Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.
Another complication is release in multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable example of this phenomenon is Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films.[tpl]cite web|first=Brandon|last=Gray|title=‘Avatar’ Claims Highest Gross of All Time|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2667&p=l.htm| work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=February 3, 2010[/tpl] Social and economic factors such as population change[tpl]cite news|last=Bialik |first=Carl |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704878904575031813961239170.html |title=What It Takes for a Movie to Be No. 1 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 30, 2010 |accessdate=August 9, 2011[/tpl] and the growth of international markets[tpl]cite news|last=Kolesnikov-Jessop |first=Sonia |title=Hollywood Presses Its Global Agenda |work=The New York Times |date=May 22, 2011 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/business/media/23film-screensingapore.html |accessdate=January 4, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Hoad |first=Phil |title=The rise of the international box office |work=The Guardian |date=August 11, 2011 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2011/aug/11/hollywood-international-box-office |accessdate=January 4, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Frankel |first=Daniel |title=Why the Foreign Box Office Leads: 'Fast Five,' 'Thor' Open Overseas First |work=The Wrap |date=May 1, 2011 |url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/rise-foreign-box-office-why-fast-five-debuted-down-under-first-26957 |accessdate=January 4, 2012[/tpl] also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.
The measuring system for gauging a film's success is based on unadjusted grosses, mainly because historically this is the way it has always been done due to the practices of the film industry: the box office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media.[tpl]cite news|last=Bialik |first=Carl |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/box-office-records-are-the-stuff-of-legend-240/ |title=Box-Office Records Are the Stuff of ‘Legend’ |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=December 17, 2007 |accessdate=August 10, 2011[/tpl] Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems due to the fact that the only data available for older films are the sale totals. As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a "top film of all time",[tpl]cite news |last=Leonhardt |first=David |title=Why ‘Avatar’ Is Not the Top-Grossing Film |date=March 1, 2010 |work=The New York Times |url=http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/why-avatar-is-not-the-top-grossing-film |accessdate=April 7, 2013[/tpl] so there is little incentive to switch to a more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.
Despite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses, and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also impact upon the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. Gone with the Wind—first released in 1939—is generally considered to be the most successful film, with Guinness World Records estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.3 billion. Estimates for Gone with the Wind[tpl]'[/tpl]s adjusted gross have varied substantially: its owner, Turner Entertainment, also estimated its adjusted earnings at $3.3 billion in 2007, a few years earlier than the Guinness estimate; other estimates fall either side of this amount, with one putting its gross just under $3 billion in 2010,[tpl]cite web|first=Tom|last=Shone|authorlink=Tom Shone|title=Oscars 2010: How James Cameron took on the world|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=February 3, 2010|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/oscars/7144424/Oscars-2010-How-James-Cameron-took-on-the-world.html|accessdate=March 22, 2012[/tpl] while another provided an alternative figure of about $3.8 billion in 2006.[tpl]cite web |last=Hill |first=George F. |title=Gone With The Wind, Indeed |date=June 25, 2006 |work=The Washington Post|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/23/AR2006062301502.html |accessdate=February 13, 2013[/tpl] Which film is Gone with the Wind[tpl]'[/tpl]s nearest rival depends on the set of figures used: Guinness have Avatar in second place with nearly $2.8 billion, while other estimates see Titanic in the runner-up spot with first-run worldwide earnings of almost $2.9 billion at 2010 prices. Including the Guinness figures, estimates for Star Wars (1977) range from $2.2–2.7 billion at 2010/11 price levels, while E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial has earned approximately $1.9–2.2 billion, and the $1.9–2.0 billion figure for Jaws is corroborated by The Economist.

[tpl]Quote box | title = [tpl]anchor|distributor rental[/tpl]Glossary: Distributor rentals | quote = Box-office figures are reported in the form of gross or distributor rentals, the latter being especially true of older films. Commonly mistaken for home video revenue, the rentals are the distributor's share of the film's theatrical revenue i.e. the box office gross less the exhibitor's cut.[tpl]cite book |last=Cones |first=John W. |title=The feature film distribution deal: a critical analysis of the single most important film industry agreement |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8093-2082-0 |page=41 |quote=Distributor rentals: It is also important to know and recognize the difference between the distributor's gross receipts and the gross rentals. The term "rentals" refers to the aggregate amount of the film distributor's share of monies paid at theatre box offices computed on the basis of negotiated agreements between the distributor and the exhibitor. Note that gross receipts refers to amounts actually received and from all markets and media, whereas gross rentals refers to amounts earned from theatrical exhibition only, regardless of whether received by the distributor. Thus, gross receipts is the much broader term and includes distributor rentals. The issue of film rentals (i.e., what percentage of a film's box office gross comes back to the distributor) is of key importance...More current numbers suggest that distributor rentals for the major studio/distributor released films average in the neighborhood of 43% of box office gross.

Audience tastes were fairly eclectic during the 20th century, but several trends did emerge. During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with The Birth of a Nation (American Civil War), The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, The Big Parade and Wings (all World War I) becoming the most successful films in their respective years of release, with the trend coming to an end with All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war themed films dominate again during this period, starting with Gone with the Wind (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with The Best Years of Our Lives (World War II) in 1946. Samson and Delilah (1949) saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during Ancient Rome/biblical times throughout the 1950s as cinema competed with television for audiences,[tpl]cite book |last=Balio|first=Tino|year=1987|title=United Artists: the Company that Changed the Film Industry|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-11440-4|page=124–125 |quote=To rekindle interest in the movies, Hollywood not only had to compete with television but also with other leisure-time activities...Movies made a comeback by 1955, but audiences had changed. Moviegoing became a special event for most people, creating the phenomenon of the big picture.[/tpl] with Quo Vadis, The Robe, The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur and Spartacus all becoming the highest-grossing film of the year during initial release, before the genre started to wane after several high-profile failures.[tpl]harvnb|Hall|Neale|2010|p=179. "Later epics proved far more disastrous for the backers. Samuel Bronston's The Fall of the Roman Empire, filmed in Spain, cost $17,816,876 and grossed only $1.9 million in America. George Stevens's long-gestating life of Christ, The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), which had been in planning since 1954 and in production since 1962, earned domestic rentals of $6,962,715 on a $21,481,745 negative cost, the largest amount yet spent on a production made entirely within the United States. The Bible—in the Beginning... (1966) was financed by the Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis from private investors and Swiss banks. He then sold distribution rights outside Italy jointly to Fox and Seven Arts for $15 million (70 percent of which came from Fox), thereby recouping the bulk of his $18 million investment. Although The Bible returned a respectable world rental of $25.3 million, Fox was still left with a net loss of just over $1.5 million. It was the last biblical epic to be released by any major Hollywood studio for nearly twenty years."[/tpl] The success of White Christmas and South Pacific in the 1950s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the 1960s with West Side Story, Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Funny Girl all among the top films of the decade. The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s. The 21st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations, with Avatar in 2009 being the only chart-topper forming an original work.
Steven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993. Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) are in second and third place with five and four films respectively, while D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and James Cameron (1991, 1997 and 2009) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. The following directors have also all directed two films on the chart: Frank Lloyd, King Vidor, Frank Capra, Michael Curtiz, Leo McCarey, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, Guy Hamilton, Mike Nichols, William Friedkin, Peter Jackson and Gore Verbinski; Mervyn LeRoy, Ken Annakin and Robert Wise are each represented by one solo credit and one shared credit, and John Ford co-directed two films. Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only five directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003) and Verbinski (2006 and 2007).
Due to release schedules—especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place due to being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. Due to incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.

==Timeline of highest-grossing films==

At least ten films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since The Birth of a Nation assumed the top spot in 1915. Both The Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg holding the record on three occasions and James Cameron—the current holder—twice. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when Jurassic Park overtook E.T., and Cameron emulated the feat when Avatar broke the record set by Titanic.
Some sources claim that The Big Parade superseded The Birth of a Nation as highest-grossing film, eventually being replaced by Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which in turn was quickly usurped by Gone with the Wind. Exact figures are not known for The Birth of a Nation, but contemporary records put its worldwide earnings at $5.2 million as of 1919.[tpl]cite book |last=Wasko |first=Janet |chapter=D.W.

This 'trade legend' has finally been acknowledged by Variety as a 'whopper myth', and the amount has been revised to $5 million.

After listing it until the mid-1970's as the top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, Variety, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and continuous exhibition, its number one position seems justified.[/tpl] the record would fall to 1925's Ben-Hur ($9,386,000) if The Birth of a Nation earned significantly less than its estimated gross.[tpl]harvnb|Hall|Neale|2010|p=163[/tpl]. "MGM's silent Ben-Hur, which opened at the end of 1925, had out-grossed all the other pictures released by the company in 1926 combined. With worldwide rentals of $9,386,000 on first release it was, with the sole possible exception of The Birth of a Nation, the highest-earning film of the entire silent era."

While it is generally accepted that Gone with the Wind took over the record of highest-grossing film on its initial release—which is true in terms of public exhibition—it is likely it did not overtake The Birth of a Nation in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s. Gone with the Wind itself may have been briefly overtaken by The Ten Commandments (1956), which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide rentals of $58–60 million[tpl]cite journal |first1=Louis |last1=Klopsch |first2=George Henry |last2=Sandison |first3=Thomas De Witt |last3=Talmage |title=Christian Herald |year=1965 |volume=88 |page=68 |quote=Yet "The Ten Commandments" has earned 58 million dollars in film rentals and is expected to bring in 10 to 15 million each year it is reissued.[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Hall|Neale|2010|pp=160–161[/tpl]. "General release began at normal prices in 1959 and continued until the end of the following year, when the film was temporarily withdrawn (the first of several reissues came in 1966).

Another film purported to have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, Deep Throat. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on juvenile justice that the film had earned $600 million;[tpl]cite news |author=Washington (AP) |work=The Free Lance–Star |title='Deep Throat' star against pornography |date=September 13, 1984 |page=12 [/tpl] this figure has been the subject of much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount.[tpl]cite news |last=Hiltzik |first=Michael |work=Los Angeles Times |title='Deep Throat' Numbers Just Don't Add Up |date=February 24, 2005 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/24/business/fi-golden24 |accessdate=February 2, 2012[/tpl] Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film's release—showed the film had grossed over $25 million.[tpl]cite news |author=Memphis (UPI) |work=The Palm Beach Post |title='Deep Throat' Defendant Found Guilty of Conspiring |date=May 1, 1976 |page=A2 [/tpl] Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.[tpl]cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |work=rogerebert.com |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |title=Inside Deep Throat |date=February 11, 2005 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050210/REVIEWS/50128001 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110606050046/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050210/REVIEWS/50128001 |archivedate=June 6, 2011 |accessdate=February 2, 2012[/tpl]
The Birth of a Nation, Gone with the Wind, The Godfather, Jaws, Star Wars, E.T. and Avatar all increased their record grosses with re-releases. The grosses from their original theatrical runs are included here along with totals from re-releases up to the point that they lost the record; therefore the total for The Birth of a Nation includes income from its reissues up to 1940; the total for Star Wars includes revenue from the late 1970s and early 1980s reissues but not from the 1997 Special Edition; the total for E.T. incorporates its gross from the 1985 reissue but not from 2002; the total for Avatar—as the current record-holder—includes all its earnings at the present time. Gone with the Wind is represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshows/first-run engagements/general release)[tpl]cite book |last=Schatz |first=Thomas |title=Boom and Bust: American Cinema in the 1940s |volume=Volume 6 of History of the American Cinema |year=1999 |publisher=University of California Press |origyear=1st. pub. 1997 |isbn=9780520221307 |pages=65–66 |quote=By July 1940, Wind reached saturation as a roadshow, and MGM revised its terms: the picture was sold on a 50-50 basis (i.e. 50 percent of the exhibitor's receipts would be returned to MGM) at prices of 40¢ in the afternoon and 50¢ in the evening; reserved seating was recommended but not contractually required. By April 1941, with its roadshow and first-run engagements finally played out, Wind had grossed $31 million and played to an estimated audience of 45 million in 8,500 theaters, with another 3,000 bookings still to be played as the film finally went into general release at "popular prices".[/tpl] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to The Sound of Music in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. The Godfather was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and Jaws was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. The Sound of Music, The Godfather, Jaws, Jurassic Park and Titanic increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013 and 2012 respectively, but they are not included in the totals here since they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.
