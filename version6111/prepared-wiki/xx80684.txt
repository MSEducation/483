The Aviadvigatel PS-90 is a Russian high-bypass commercial turbofan rated at 16000 kgf (157 kN, 35,300 lbf) thrust. It powers Russian airliners such as the Ilyushin Il-96 and the Tupolev Tu-204/Tu-214 series and transport aircraft such as the Ilyushin Il-76. It is made by the Russian aircraft engine company Aviadvigatel, which is the successor of the Soviet Soloviev Design Bureau. "PS" are the initials of Pavel Aleksandrovich Soloviev (Russian:Павел Алеќсандрович Соловьёв).

==Design and development==

With the advent of new generation of Russian airliners, Aviadvigatel developed the PS-90 to satisfy the demands of economy, performance and exhaust emissions. It represented a huge advance over previous generations of 1960s era Soviet engines. The PS-90 is almost double the efficiency of those engines and is reasonably competitive to the current generation of western engines.

===Design features===

It incorporates many firsts in a Russian engine with advanced technology features such as
It was first certified in 1992 and has been in service since.

==Variants==

There are five variants; the basic PS-90A, the PS-90A-76, the improved PS-90A variants, PS-90A1 and PS-90A2, and the PS-90A-42 turbojet.

===PS-90A===

The PS-90A engine is the initial variant and is standard equipment for Ilyushin Il-96-400, Tupolev-204-100 and the Tupolev-214. For the first time it allowed Russian airliners to achieve similar performance and economy to their western counterparts. PS-90A is rated nominally at 16000 kgf (157 kN, 35,300 lbf) thrust, 13.3% less than the original Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engine (which are also offered on the Tu-204), and the fuel consumption is 8.2% less than it.

===PS-90A-76===

This variant is a modification of the basic PS-90A engine. It extends the service life of the large fleet of the Il-76 transport airplanes and raises their efficiency by installation of the PS-90A-76 engine instead of the D-30KP. It transformed these noisy and thirsty airplanes into new quiet, economical and extended range variant, the Ilyushin Il-76MF, capable of exceeding current regulatory requirements. It is rated nominally at 16,000 kgf (142 kN, 32,000 lbf) thrust.

===PS-90A2===

The PS-90A2 is an advanced derivative of the PS-90A,developed in co-operation with Pratt & Whitney.http://www.avid.ru/eng/pr/news/654/ It has a fair proportion of western components from France, Germany, Sweden and the USA. It is also lighter than PS-90A and features improved FADEC. These features improve the performance and reduce maintenance costs by 40%. Fuel consumption is on par with current western engines, and its noise levels are below the current regulatory requirements. The PS-90A2 is the first Russian engine to be ETOPS-180 min rated. It is offered in newly built aircraft and is completely interchangeable with the PS-90A, allowing simple upgrades on present airliners.
It has the same thrust rating as the PS-90A, 16000 kgf (157 kN, 35,300 lbf) thrust. It is also capable of 18000 kgf (176 kN, 39,600 lbf) thrust.
Future American involvement in engine development has been put in doubt after unwelcome attempts to block sale of PS-90A2 engines to a major Iranian customer for the type.http://www.rbcdaily.ru/2010/04/15/industry/471843
