Strel's first two  river swims were the Krka river (105 km) in his homeland, in 28 hours in 1992, and the boundary Kolpa river ([tpl]convert|62|km[/tpl]), in 16 hours in 1993. In 2000, he swam the Danube River ([tpl]convert|2860|km[/tpl]) and achieved the world long distance swimming record ([tpl]convert|3004|km[/tpl]) in 58 days. In July 2001, he achieved one more world record — [tpl]convert|504.5|km[/tpl] of non-stop swimming in Danube within 84 hours and 10 minutes.
In 2002, he swam the entire Mississippi River ([tpl]convert|3885|km[/tpl]) in 68 days. In 2003, he swam the Argentine Paraná River ([tpl]convert|3998|km[/tpl]). On 10 June 2004, Martin started swimming down the Yangtze River ([tpl]convert|4003|km[/tpl], the longest river in Asia, the third longest in the world) in China. He reached Shanghai in 40 days on 30 July 2004, one day before planned.
Strel swam the Amazon River, commencing on 1 February 2007, finishing 66 days later on April 7, 2007. This was a record-breaking distance of [tpl]convert|5268|km[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|title=Longest journey swim|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/2000/longest-journey-swimming|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=1 March 2014[/tpl] longer than the width of the Atlantic Ocean. He had escort boats that were prepared to pour blood into the river to distract meat-eating fish such as piranhas.
In 2007, the Nile had been proposed as his next river, but Strel said, "I am not going to do the Nile. It's long but not challenging enough, it is just a small creek. The Amazon is much more mighty."
He plans to swim across Lake Arenal on September 29, 2010 as part of his visit to an environmentalist international film festival in Costa Rica. He plans to swim about 6 kilometres from shore and then back to his starting point.[tpl]cite news |title=Reconocido ambientalista esloveno nadará en el lago Arenal |first=Pablo |last=Fonseca |language=Spanish |newspaper=La Nación |date=27 September 2010 |url=http://www.nacion.com/2010-09-27/AldeaGlobal/UltimaHora/AldeaGlobal2537040.aspx |location=San José, Costa Rica |trans_title=Renowned Slovenian environmentalist will swim in Lake Arenal[/tpl]
