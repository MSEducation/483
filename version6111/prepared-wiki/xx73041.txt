The ongoing manga premiered in Japan in the Kadokawa Shoten shōjo magazine Monthly Asuka in November 1997.

Xebec adapted the manga into a 26-episode anime series which aired in Japan on TV Tokyo from April 3, 2003 until September 25, 2003. The anime was later adapted into second two volume manga series, a PlayStation 2 video game, and a series of drama CDs.

==Plot==

D.N.Angel follows the adventures of Daisuke Niwa, an average teenage boy. At the story's opening, Daisuke declares love for his crush, a girl named Risa Harada, on his fourteenth birthday. She rejects him, and later that day, the heart-broken Daisuke undergoes a strange mutation that changes him into another person. He is told calmly by his mother Emiko that, because of a strange genetic condition, all the males in Daisuke's family gain the countenance of Dark Mousy, a famous phantom thief. The transformation occurs every time Daisuke has romantic feelings for his crush or whenever he thinks too long about her. Dark changes back into Daisuke the same way. Daisuke is forced to keep his family's secret and control his alter ego, Dark (who Risa, Daisuke's crush, has fallen for), while dashing his way out of being caught by the commander of the police. Daisuke learns that in order to return to normality, he must have his unrequited love returned. 
The aforementioned commander of the police is a classmate of Daisuke's named Satoshi Hiwatari. Hiwatari suffers from his own version of the phantom-thief curse, and a bond forms between Hiwatari and Daisuke because of their similar afflictions. Hiwatari carries the alter-ego named Krad. However, though Dark and Krad hate one another, Hiwatari and Daisuke maintain a strained but genuine friendship, despite Dark's constant moaning. Dark steals certain artistic objects of value, works made by Satoshi's ancestors, because they contain dangerous magical properties. Some of them, such as "The Second Hand of Time" and "Argentine" also have personalities of their own. Some of the objects that he steals are quite dangerous. Dark's method of stealing is based on garnering attention; before stealing, Emiko will send out a warning of what will be stolen.

In August 2003, while the primary series was on hiatus, a second manga series, D.N.Angel TV Animation Series began serialization in Monthly Asuka. Also written by Sugisaki, the short series was based on the anime adaptation, which had diverged from the storyline of the manga series. D.N.Angel TV Animation Series finished its serialization in the October 2003 issue. It was published in two tankōbon volumes by Kadokawa Shoten.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]

The series was originally licensed for release in North America and the United Kingdom by ADV Films.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.advfilms.com/titles/dnangel/ | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090609000737/http://www.advfilms.com/titles/dnangel/ | archivedate=2009-06-09|title=D.N.Angel |publisher=ADV Films |accessdate=2008-12-21[/tpl] While in the UK the series is no longer licensed, in North America Discotek Media have announced the rescue-licensing of the series.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-05-02/discotek-media-adds-dnangel-tv-anime/ |title=D.N.Angel|publisher=Discotek Media |accessdate=2011-05-03 [/tpl]  The series is licensed in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.madman.com.au/actions/series.do?method=view&videogramId=2495 |title=D.N.Angel |publisher=Madman Entertainment |accessdate=2008-12-21 [/tpl]
Five pieces of theme music are used in the anime adaptation. The song [tpl]nihongo|"White Night -True Light-"|白夜 〜True Light〜|Byakuya -True Light-[/tpl], by Shunichi Miyamoto, is used for the opening for  twenty four episodes. Vic Mignogna, the English voice actor for Dark Mousy, covered the opening for the English dub. For the ending theme, [tpl]nihongo|"Gentle Afternoon"|やさしい午後|Yasashii Gogo[/tpl] is used for the first twelve episodes, and [tpl]nihongo|"The Day It Begins"|はじまりの日|Hajimari no Hi[/tpl] is used for episodes 13-23 and episode 25. Both songs are performed by Minawo. Episode 24 uses the song "Caged Bird", by Shunichi Miyamoto, for its ending, while the final episode of the series uses Miyamoto's song [tpl]nihongo|"Guidepost"|道標|Michishirube[/tpl].

===Video game===

A PlayStation 2 video game, [tpl]Nihongo|D.N.Angel: Kurenai no Tsubasa|D·N·ANGEL〜紅の翼〜|Deī.Enu.Enjeru ~Kurenai no Tsubasa~|lit. "D.N.Angel: Crimson Wings"[/tpl], was published by Takara. The game was released in Japan on September 25, 2003 to coincide with the conclusion of the anime adaptation.  However, the game storyline is closer to the manga, and even mentions past events from the manga that would make it inconsistent with the anime.

===Drama CDs===

A trilogy of drama CDs called D.N.Angel Wink was released in 1999 between March and December. Some of the scenes follow the manga word-for-word, while others have either minor differences or do not appear in the manga at all. The first CD is called "Target: Sleeping Beauty" and was released on March 5, 1999. The second is "2nd Target: Love Sick" and was released on November 17, 1999. The third is "3rd Target: Love Pleasure" and was released on December 15, 1999. There is another CD, "A Legend of a Vampire" that uses the same voice cast as the Wink dramas, though it doesn't relate to the manga. This CD was released in 2001. The plot centers around Daisuke's alter ego, Dark, being a vampire. Krad, who wasn't in the Wink dramas, also made an appearance in this CD.
There were also two drama CDs released after the anime titled "Sweet" and "Cute". These CDs use the anime voice actors and are based on the anime with events taking place just before its ending. They also include parodies of scenes in the anime.

===Novels===

Three novels were released in Japan between September 2000 and September 2001.  The titles are [tpl]nihongo|Ningyo no Namida|人魚の涙||lit. "Mermaid's Tears"[/tpl], [tpl]nihongo|Yuki no Jyoou|雪の女王||lit. "Snow Queen"[/tpl], and [tpl]nihongo|Garasu no Kutsuri|硝子の靴||lit. "Glass Shoes"[/tpl].  Although there was an ad for them left in Tokyopop's translation of the fourth manga volume, they have not been licensed, so little is known about them.

===Radio program===

A series of seven broadcasts aired Japan  in 2005 called Decade on Net: Radio D.N.Angel. It was hosted by Miyu Irino and Akira Ishida, who voiced Daisuke Niwa and Satoshi Hiwatari, respectively.
