[[Ocean racing]]

CATEGORIES: Sailing races

Ocean Racing may refer to either yacht racing, in particular of the Maxi yachts; or multisport events with a significant Ocean related Swim or Kayak. In Some Cases, multi-sport events are held in Lakes, or Rivers, in which case, the Multi-sport event would not be classed as having an Ocean Component, although there are some exceptions (such as roving Multisport events, at Olympic Games, or World Championships, etc.).
