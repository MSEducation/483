==The game==

Both Johnny Bower of the Toronto Maple Leafs and the All-Stars' Glenn Hall of the Chicago Black Hawks were unbeatable through the first half of the game. However, in the second half, the All-Stars managed to put three pucks behind Terry Sawchuk while the Leafs could only score twice on Charlie Hodge of the Montreal Canadiens.
Montreal's Jean Beliveau scored the go-ahead goal, on assists from Chicago's Bobby Hull and Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings, late in the second period. Murray Oliver of the Boston Bruins and Jim Pappin of the Leafs traded goals in the third.
Hodge became the first goaltender to be penalized in the eighteen-year history of the All-Star game when he was whistled down in the second period for holding the puck.[tpl]cite web |title=NHL All-Star Game History |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=28932 |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl]
