Sharper Image is an American product brand, formerly associated with a defunct retail company, now licensed for use on consumer electronics and gift products."About Us." The Sharper Image. Retrieved on February 18, 2010.
The earlier consumer products retailer by that name was founded by Richard Thalheimer and was in business from 1977 until its closing in 2008. The company sold merchandise through dozens of retail stores throughout the United States, a monthly catalog and its website, along with business-to-business sales teams which marketed products for corporate incentive programs and wholesale to retailers.
On February 19, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, blaming low sales aggravated by a decline in consumer spending and negative publicity surrounding its Ionic Breeze air purifiers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2008-02-20-sharper-image_N.htm?csp=34|accessdate=2008-02-20|title=Sharper Image files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection | work=USA Today | first=Matt | last=Krantz | date=2008-02-21[/tpl] At that time the company had 2,500 employees.

==History==

The Sharper Image Corporation was the brainchild of Richard Thalheimer.  The company started as a catalog business to sell jogging watches.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2006/09/26/financial/f084807D10.DTL&type=business|title=Sharper Image founder Thalheimer is removed as CEO|last=Liedtke|first=Michael|accessdate=2007-08-09 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  
In 2006 there was a change in the board of directors of the company, including the removal of Thalheimer as CEO.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/09/27/BUGGLLD5L71.DTL&type=tech|title=Sharper Image axes chief executive|last=Kim|first=Ryan|accessdate=2007-08-09 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=2006-09-27[/tpl]
Thalheimer was replaced by Chairman Jerry W. Levin, who was formerly Chairman and CEO of American Household/Sunbeam, Coleman, and Revlon, and under whom Sunbeam Products/American Household had filed for bankruptcy in 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ecolab.com/Investor/Governance/JerryLevin.html|title=Jerry W.

Levin is also Chairman & CEO of JW Levin Partners LLC, a management and investment firm, since February 2005. And as of October 2009, is Chairman and Interim CEO of Wilton Brands, Inc. Levin was Vice Chairman of Clinton Group, a private diversified asset management company, between December 2007 and October 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=117565&p=irol-govBio&ID=126218|title=Biography of Jerry W. Levin|accessdate=2008-09-01[/tpl]  On February 8, 2008, 11 days before he announced the Sharper Image bankruptcy filing, JWL Partners Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, submitted an IPO filing.  The filing showed US$200 million proceeds targeted.  The underwriting group was listed as Credit Suisse and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.  They applied to list under the ticker “JWL.U” on the American Stock Exchange. The filing stated that the blank check corporation intends to acquire or acquire control of one or more businesses. The filing was eventually withdrawn due to the economic market conditions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/spac-ipo-filing-jwl-partners/story.aspx?guid=%7BAE1648C8%2DE859%2D49CC%2DBB4D%2D94A4DF0F3AA5%7D|title=SPAC IPO FILING: JWL Partners (JWL, SHRP)|date=February 11, 2008|accessdate=2008-09-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ipoportal.edgar-online.com/ipo/textSection.asp?cikid=769994&fnid=57638&IPO=1&sec=bd&coname=JWL+PARTNERS+ACQUISITION+CORP.|title=Initial Public Offerings (IPO): Business description of JWL PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP.|accessdate=2008-09-01[/tpl]
On April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and Chairman of the Board of the company to pursue participating with other investors to acquire some or all of the company’s businesses or assets. But, as was pointed out, "Levin hasn't made a lot of money for the investors of Sharper Image he's teamed up with so far, including hedge fund Ramius Capital, which helped bring him in as a director, and Clinton Group, which announced a large stake in December."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/04112008/business/sharper_image_eyed_by_ex_chair_106082.htm|title=SHARPER IMAGE EYED BY EX-CHAIR|first=KAJA|last=WHITEHOUSE|date=April 11, 2008|accessdate=2008-09-01|publisher=The New York Post[/tpl] Under Levin, the company's stock price had fallen from about $40 three years ago to about 23 cents (a "paltry" $3.6 million market capitalization) at the time of his departure, on the over-the-counter pink sheets.http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SHARPER_IMAGE_CHAIRMAN?SITE=SLWIJ&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2008-04-10-09-10-53 [tpl]Dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl]  His group's bid did not succeed.http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/080410/20080410005358.html [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2008[/tpl]
In May 2007, Thalheimer created his own e-commerce site http://richardsolo.com, which has no affiliation with The Sharper Image, and sells items that were typical of the Sharper Image when its focus was offbeat consumer electronics.

===Bankruptcy===

On February 19, 2008, The Sharper Image stock reached a record low of 41 cents a share, followed by 29 cents a share on February 20, 2008.

On May 29, 2008, a joint venture led by units of private investment firms Hilco Consumer Capital Corp. Infinity Lifestyle Brands and Gordon Brothers Group won a bankruptcy auction to acquire the assets of The Sharper Image, paying $49 million plus some contingent recovery for the company's assets.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/fundsFundsNews/idUSN2931519320080529 | title = Investment firms win Sharper Image in bankruptcy | publisher = Reuters | date = 2008-05-29 | accessdate = 2008-07-21 | first=Emily | last=Chasan[/tpl]

===Post-bankruptcy===

The Sharper Image name was licensed as a product brand, by a joint venture between Hilco Consumer Capital, Infinity Lifestyle Brands, Gordon Brothers and Bluestar Alliance.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/8587334?FORM=ZZNR2|title=Meltdown 101: Shuttered stores' sites still sell|last=Fredrix|first=Emily|date=2009-07-01|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-11-10 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Kavilanz |first=Parija B. |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/04/26/news/companies/retail_deadbrands/index.htm |title=Brands of defunct retailers making a comeback — Apr. 26, 2009 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2009-04-26 |accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl] The brand is used to sell products through third party retailers, including Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond, OfficeMax, and Big 5 Sporting Goods. In August 2009, Camelot Venture Group began running the company website. They also announced plans to open new retail stores.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.camelotventures.com/news-09-sharperimage.html|title=Camelot Venture Group and Sharper Image Join Forces|date=2009-08-07|publisher=Camelot Venture Group|accessdate=2009-11-10[/tpl]
Iconix Brand Group bought The Sharper Image in 2011.

==Advertising and business==

The Sharper Image's advertising budget was primarily directed to its monthly catalog for about the first 20 years of its existence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://doc.morningstar.com/doccenter.aspx?doccategory=equity&mode=normalview&companyid=0C0000090A&display=PINX:SHRPQ&clientid=dotcom&key=9bc0dc0ff19106fc# |title=Morningstar Document Library |publisher=Doc.morningstar.com |accessdate=2011-06-30[/tpl]  Once products like the Ionic Breeze were introduced, the company began using infomercials for advertising.  Most other products in the home air purifier market (including those made by Oreck) already used this medium, so The Sharper Image followed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl] This move boosted sales, but led to confusion between prices advertised on television and those marked in the retail stores.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl]
The company was known to receive special supplier contracts.  For instance, its HW551 and HW552 product code massage chairs were specific to The Sharper Image, and Human Touch Interactive does not sell those specific chairs to any other retailer.  Ever since the Robosapien was released on the market a few years ago, The Sharper Image had the exclusive rights to sell the "Signature Series" Robosapiens in chrome or blue-chrome, as opposed to the standard white models that are sold in other stores.

==Consumer Reports lawsuit==

In 2002, Consumer Reports tested many fan-driven air purifiers alongside The Sharper Image's Ionic Breeze Quadra.  The Sharper Image was not happy with the results, and sued Consumer Reports in order to get what they thought would be a more fair testing of the product.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/appliances/heating-cooling-and-air/air-cleaners/sharper-image-lawsuit-ends-505-air-purifier-ionic-air-cleaner/index.htm|title=Sharper Image pays $525,000 to end lawsuit against CU|accessdate=2007-08-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070806102618/http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/appliances/heating-cooling-and-air/air-cleaners/sharper-image-lawsuit-ends-505-air-purifier-ionic-air-cleaner/index.htm |archivedate = August 6, 2007[/tpl]  However, the suit was dismissed, primarily due to the court finding that the company "has not shown that the test protocol used by Consumers Union was scientifically, or otherwise, invalid," and had not "demonstrated a reasonable probability that any of the challenged statements were false."  Furthermore, Sharper Image could not "come forward with any evidence from which a finding of malice could be made."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/14Legal/ionicbreeze.html|title=Court Dismisses Sharper Image Lawsuit against Consumers Union|last=Barrett|first=Stephen|accessdate=2008-03-05[/tpl]
Two years later, Consumer Reports stated that the Quadra could be dangerous to consumers' health, because of the trace levels of ozone produced by the unit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7391185/|title=Consumer Reports calls air purifier ‘unhealthy’|accessdate=2007-08-09[/tpl]  As a result, sales plummeted, and the stores took back units, even ones that were years old, for a cash refund.  The Sharper Image's response was to work with the Engelhard Corporation and create an ozone catalyst that would reduce the purified air of excess ozone before it circulated throughout the room.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_July_25/ai_n14815944|title=Sharper Image Ionic Breeze Air Purifiers Are the First to Feature OzoneGuard|accessdate=2007-08-09 | work=Business Wire | date=2005-07-25[/tpl]
