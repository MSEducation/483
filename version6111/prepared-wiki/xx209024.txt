[[Klebsiella pneumonia]]

CATEGORIES: Enterobacteria

Klebsiella pneumonia is a form of bacterial pneumonia associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae.
It is typically due to aspiration by alcoholics, though it is more commonly implicated in hospital-acquired urinary tract and wound infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and diabetics.

==Presentation==

Patients with Klebsiella pneumonia tend to cough up a characteristic sputum that is said to resemble "red-currant jelly".
Klebsiella pneumonia tends to affect people with underlying diseases, such as alcoholism, diabetes and chronic lung disease.

==Treatment and resistance==

Treatment for Klebsiella pneumonia is by antibiotics such as aminoglycosides and cephalosporins, the choice depending upon the patient’s health condition, medical history and severity of the disease.Buzzle --> Klebsiella Pneumoniae By Ningthoujam Sandhyarani. Published: 16 December 2008
However, Klebsiella possesses a chromosomal class A beta-lactamase giving it resistance to ampicillin. Many strains have acquired an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase with additional resistance to carbenicillin, amoxicillin, and increasingly to ceftazidime. The bacteria remain largely susceptible to aminoglycosides and cephalosporins. Varying degrees of inhibition of the beta-lactamase with clavulanic acid have been reported. Infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens in the ICU have invoked the re-emergence of colistin, an antibiotic that had rarely been used for decades. However, colistin-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae have been reported in Greek ICUs.[tpl]cite journal |author=Antoniadou A, Kontopidou F, Poulakou G, et al. |title=Colistin-resistant isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae emerging in intensive care unit patients: first report of a multiclonal cluster |journal=J.

Klebsiella cases in Taiwan have shown abnormal toxicity, causing liver abscesses in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Treatment consists of third generation cephalosporins.[tpl]cite journal |author=Liu YC, Cheng DL, Lin CL |title=Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess associated with septic endophthalmitis |journal=Arch.

===Spread of resistant strains===

Klebsiella resistant strains have been recorded in USA with a roughly threefold increase in Chicago cases,[tpl]cite web |author=Bigongiari J |title=Chicago sees drug-resistant bacteria spreading |date=October 26, 2010 |publisher=VaccineNewsDaily.com |url=http://vaccinenewsdaily.com/news/218653-chicago-sees-drug-resistant-bacteria-spreading[/tpl] Brazil http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5iGkjXXk7Wqvs8dTt7CVYVSpFEZXA?docId=4944703 with 15 deaths per 163 cases, quarantined individuals in Israel,[tpl]cite news |author=Siegel-Itzcovich J |title=Israelis hospitalized in India to be checked for 'bugs' |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=26 October 2010  |url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=192859[/tpl] United Kingdom and parts of Europe.

==Eponym==

Community-acquired pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae may be called Friedländer's Pneumonia, after Carl Friedländer.
