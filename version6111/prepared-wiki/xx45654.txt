The 1964 Games marked South Africa's Paralympic Games d√©but. The country had just been banned from taking part in the Olympic Games, due to its policy of apartheid, and was thus absent from the 1964 Summer Olympics. It was not, however, banned from the Paralympics until 1980, and Japan (as host country) did not oppose its participation."'The Netherlands against Apartheid' - 1970s", International Institute of Social HistorySouth Africa at the Paralympics, International Paralympic Committee
