It is more common in developed than developing countries. One thus sees lower rates in Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. Within developed countries it is more common in those who are economically disadvantaged while in contrast in developing countries it is more common in the affluent. The reason for these differences is not well known. Low and middle income countries make up more than 80% of the mortality.[tpl]cite web |author=World Health Organization |authorlink=World Health Organization|title=WHO: Asthma|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs307/en/ |accessdate=2007-12-29|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071215181927/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs307/en/| archivedate= 15 December 2007| deadurl= no[/tpl]

From 2000-2010, the average cost per asthma-related hospital stay in the United States for children remained relatively stable at about $3,600, whereas the average cost per asthma-related hospital stay for adults increased from $5,200 to $6,600.[tpl]cite web | author = Barrett ML, Wier LM, and Washington R. | title = Trends in Pediatric and Adult Hospital Stays for Asthma, 2000-2010. | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #169 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = January 2014 | url = http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb169-Asthma-Trends-Hospital-Stays.jsp [/tpl] In 2010, Medicaid was the most frequent primary payer among children and adults aged 18–44 years in the United States; private insurance was the second most frequent payer.

==History==

Asthma was recognized in Ancient Egypt and was treated by drinking an incense mixture known as kyphi.[tpl]cite book | author = Manniche L | title = Sacred luxuries: fragrance, aromatherapy, and cosmetics in ancient Egypt | pages = 49 | year = 1999 | publisher = Cornell University Press | isbn=978-0-8014-3720-5 [/tpl] It was officially named as a specific respiratory problem by Hippocrates circa 450 BC, with the Greek word for "panting" forming the basis of our modern name. In 200 BC it was believed to be at least partly related to the emotions.
In 1873, one of the first papers in modern medicine on the subject tried to explain the pathophysiology of the disease while one in 1872, concluded that asthma can be cured by rubbing the chest with chloroform liniment.[tpl]cite journal | author = Thorowgood JC | title = On bronchial asthma | journal =British Medical Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 673 | pages = 600 |date=November 1873 | pmid = 20747287| pmc = 2294647 |doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.673.600 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Gaskoin G | title = On the treatment of asthma | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 587 | pages = 339 |date=March 1872 | pmid = 20746575 | pmc = 2297349 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.587.339 [/tpl] Medical treatment in 1880, included the use of intravenous doses of a drug called pilocarpin.[tpl]cite journal | author = Berkart JB | title = The treatment of asthma | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 1016 | pages = 917–8 |date=June 1880| pmid = 20749537 | pmc = 2240555 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.1016.917 [/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | author = Berkart JB | title = The treatment of asthma | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 1017 | pages = 960–2 |date=June 1880 | pmid = 20749546 | pmc = 2240530 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.1017.960 [/tpl] In 1886, F.H.

A notable and well-documented case in the 19th century was that of young Theodore Roosevelt (1857-1919). At that time there was no effective treatment. Roosevelt's youth was in large part shaped by his poor health partly related to his asthma. He experienced recurring nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, terrifying the boy and his parents.[tpl]cite book|author=David McCullough|title=Mornings on Horseback: The Story of an Extraordinary Faimly, a Vanished Way of Life and the Unique Child Who Became Theodore Roosevelt|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nuzmvrqPvdIC&pg=PA93|year=1981|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=93–108[/tpl]
During the 1930s–1950s, asthma was known as one of the "holy seven" psychosomatic illnesses. Its cause was considered to be psychological, with treatment often based on psychoanalysis and other talking cures. As these psychoanalysts interpreted the asthmatic wheeze as the suppressed cry of the child for its mother, they considered the treatment of depression to be especially important for individuals with asthma.[tpl]cite journal |author=Opolski M, Wilson I |title=Asthma and depression: a pragmatic review of the literature and recommendations for future research |journal=Clin Pract Epidemol Ment Health |volume=1 |page=18 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16185365 |pmc=1253523 |doi=10.1186/1745-0179-1-18 [/tpl]
