Fossil specimens of two individuals' body mass were examined by Legendre and Roth. The first specimen was estimated to weigh 7.06 kg (15.5 lbs). The second specimen was estimated to weigh 6.80 kg (14.9 lbs).S. Legendre and C. Roth. 1988. Correlation of carnassial tooth size and body weight in recent carnivores (Mammalia). Historical Biology

==Species==

M. conferta (synonymous with Tomarctus paulus) was named by Matthew in 1918. In 1924, Matthew recombined it and named it Tomarctus confertus. It again was verified by Matthew in 1924, Green (1948), Hough (1948) and Downs in 1956. X. Wang restudied the specimens and recombined it as Microtomarctus conferta.PaleoBiology Database: Microtomarctus conferta Species
