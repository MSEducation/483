==History==

The venue was opened in 1932 as the Gaumont Palace and seated nearly 3,500 people. It was designed by Robert Cromie in the Art Deco style.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theater/3774/|title=Hammersmith Apollo|publisher=Cinema Treasures|accessdate=2012-10-14[/tpl] In 1962, the building was renamed the Hammersmith Odeon, a name many people still use for the venue along with the phonetic abbreviation "Hammy-O". It became a Grade II listed building in 1990. The venue was later refurbished and renamed the Labatt's Apollo following a sponsorship deal with Labatt Brewing Company (1993 or 1994).
In 2002, the venue was again renamed, this time to the Carling Apollo after Carling brewery struck a deal with the owners, US-based Clear Channel Entertainment (spun off as Live Nation (Venues) UK Ltd in 2005). The venue's listing was upgraded to Grade II* status in 2005. In 2003, the stalls seats were made removable and now some concerts have full seating whilst others have standing-only in the stalls. In the latter format the venue can accommodate around 5,000 people. The event was marked by rock band AC/DC playing an exclusive one-off concert and only charging £10 per ticket. All 5,000 tickets sold out in 4 minutes. In 2006, the venue reverted to its former name, the Hammersmith Apollo. In 2007, the original 1932 Compton pipe organ, still present from the building's days as a cinema, was restored. The building then changed hands and was bought by the MAMA Group.
On 14 January 2009, a placing announcement by HMV Group revealed that by selling additional shares, the company would raise money to fund a joint venture with the MAMA Group, to run eleven live music venues across the United Kingdom, including the Hammersmith Apollo. As a result, the venue was named the HMV Apollo from 2009 until 2012. Other venues purchased include The Forum in London's Kentish Town, the Birmingham Institute and Aberdeen's Moshulu.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7829339.stm|title=HMV to snap up some Zavvi stores|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-01-14|accessdate=2009-01-15[/tpl] The venue was sold by HMV Group in May 2012 to AEG Live and CTS Eventim.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18284304|title=Hammersmith Apollo in London sold by HMV to Stage C|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=31 May 2012[/tpl] In 2013, the venue was closed for an extensive refurbishment which was carried out by award-winning architect Foster Wilson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/foster-wilson-completes-hammersmith-apollo-revamp/5059558.article|title=Foster Wilson completes Hammersmith Apollo revamp|year=2013|publisher=bdonline.co.uk|accessdate=27 August 2013[/tpl] The venue reopened as the Eventim Apollo on 7 September 2013, with a concert performance by Selena Gomez[tpl]cite web|url=http://ticketnews.eventim.co.uk/eventim-apollo/|title=Introducing the Eventim Apollo|year=2013|publisher=Eventim Ticketnews|accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/new-look-hammersmith-apollo-unveiled/055979|title=The Eventim Apollo is unveiled|year=2013|publisher=Music Week|accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl]

==The Compton pipe organ==

The original 1932 Compton pipe organ is still present at the Apollo and was fully restored to playing condition in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hws.org.uk|title=Your browser does not support frames. To view our web site click here: http://www.ssfweb.co.uk/hws/|publisher=Hws.org.uk|date=|accessdate=2012-10-14[/tpl] It has a four-manual console which rises through the stage on a new lift and about 1,200 organ pipes housed in large chambers above the front stalls ceiling. Having fallen into disrepair, the organ was disconnected in the 1990s and the console removed from the building. However at English Heritage and the council's insistence it has been reinstated and the entire organ restored. A launch party was held on 25 July 2007, at which an invited audience and the media witnessed top organist Richard Hills play the instrument.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=RFzcVN3Fu4w|title=Youtube video of organ launch party|publisher=YouTube|date=26 July 2007|accessdate=2012-10-14[/tpl]
Pipe organs such as this were installed in most cinemas of the pre-war period to provide music for film shows, accompany silent movies and to feature in solo performances. Many were also broadcast on the radio and recorded on 78 rpm records. These organs were based on church-type instruments but had many other sounds including percussion instruments built in. A lot of the pipe sounds were designed to sound like instruments of the orchestra and indeed the organs were in effect one-man orchestras, offering a large variety of sounds and being capable of accommodating music styles from classical to jazz. Although several such organs survive in the UK these days, there are very few left in their original buildings. The Apollo organ is one of these and its sounds now fill the huge Apollo auditorium again after about 25 years of silence.

==In popular culture==

Many bands have released live CDs, videos or DVDs of concerts held at the Apollo, such as Kings of Leon, Tears For Fears, Dire Straits, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Robbie Williams. Kate Bush released a video and record EP of her concerts at the Odeon from her first and only tour in 1979. Duran Duran recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon on 16 November 1982 and released Live at Hammersmith '82!.

It is also the location in The Football Factory where the Chelsea fans board the bus for Liverpool. It is mentioned in the poem "Glam Rock: The Poem" by the poet Robert Archambeau. The exterior of the (then) Gaumont Palace was used as the "Grand" cinema in the 1957 British film The Smallest Show on Earth.
