According to legend, after the battle the rebellious lords were brought to Rollin, who informed them that he had sworn that only two heads from them would pay for the revolt.  When the rebels offered up their treasure instead, Rollin allowed them to cast two silver heads which he took instead of executing them.  The silver heads were stored in the collegiate church of Neuchâtel until the Protestant Reformation when they were melted down by the iconoclasts.[tpl]cite book|last=Guerber|first=Hélène Adeline|title=Legends of Switzerland|year=1905|publisher=Dodd, Mead & Co|pages=79-81|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=k_8YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]
