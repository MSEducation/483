===Changes to core team qualifying===

On 9 October 2013, the IRB announced significant changes to the promotion/relegation process.
First, only one promotion place will be available for the 2014–15 series. Also, the World Series Pre-Qualifier, which was a 12-team tournament contested as part of the 2013 Hong Kong Sevens, is being folded into the Core Team Qualifier, which now involves 12 teams and will be entirely contested at the Hong Kong Sevens. The bottom-placed core team at the end of the season will now be automatically relegated, with no opportunity to retain core status.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/mediacentre/news/newsid=2068901.html#one+down+hsbc+sevens+world+series |title=One up one down for HSBC World Sevens Series |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=9 October 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2013[/tpl]
