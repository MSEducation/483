Annaghmore railway station served Annaghmore in County Armagh, Northern Ireland.

==History==

The station was opened in 1858 by the Portadown, Dungannon and Omagh Junction Railway, which the Great Northern Railway (GNR) took over in 1876. Annaghmore was served by GNR passenger trains between [tpl]rws|Belfast Great Victoria Street[/tpl] and [tpl]rws|Londonderry Foyle Road[/tpl] via [tpl]rws|Portadown[/tpl]. The GNR built a fruit store at the station for the considerable traffic of locally-grown produce, mainly apples and strawberries, that it shipped out of the area by special trains.[tpl]cite book |last=FitzGerald |first=J.D. |year=1995 |series=Colourpoint Transport |title=The Derry Road |volume=2 |location=Gortrush |publisher=Colourpoint Press |isbn=1-898392-09-9 |page=1[/tpl] The Ulster Transport Authority took over the GNR's remaining lines in Northern Ireland in 1958 and closed the PD&O on 15 February 1965.
After the line was closed the former station was sold. For a time it was a car dealership and repair garage but in August 2010 it was disused and semi-derelict. Parts of the up and down platforms still stand, along with the main station building beside the down platform and some other former railway buildings on the site.
