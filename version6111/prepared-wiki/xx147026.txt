Ana Lydia Vega (born Dec. 6, 1946, Santurce, Puerto Rico) is a celebrated Puerto Rican female writer. She has received the Premio Juan Rulfo (1982) and the Premio Casa de las Américas (1981). Vega was a professor of French literature and Caribbean studies at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, and retired when her literary work became a success.

==Biography==

Her parents were Virgilio Vega, from Coamo, Puerto Rico, y Doña María Santana, a teacher from the town of Arroyo. She studied at the Academia del Sagrado Corazón, and at the University of Puerto Rico, receiving a Bachelor's degree in 1968. She went on to study at the University of Provence, France, receiving a master's in French literature in 1971, and a doctorate in French literature in 1978.

==Writing elements==

===Historic context===

Puerto Rico's history plays a role in Vega's writings.  The country became a U.S. territory under the Treaty of Paris (1898), after the Spanish American War.  Remorse still exists toward one of the leading causes of the war, and many people[tpl]who|date=October 2011[/tpl] believe that the bombing of the US battleship Maine (ACR-1) was a conspiracy.  This sentiment is present in Vega's works.
Puerto Rico became a commonwealth after adopting a constitution on July 25, 1952.  Because of the nation's ties to the United States, English is mixed with Spanish to make up the dialect of the region, which is used in her writings.  Migration to the United States is common, and it is also a theme in Vega's stories.
Vega's writing is also influenced by her familiarity with African oral traditions. In 1978, she wrote her doctoral thesis on the influence of Haitian leader Henri Christophe on African American theater and on theater in the Antilles. Vega's father was an accomplished practitioner of the Décima, a Puerto Rican form of poetry emphasizing improvisation.

===Language===

Language in Vega's works breaks every norm of grammar. Also, Vega's use of English/Spanish interaction is a backdrop of unresolved tensions.

===Feminism===

In most of Vega's writings, hierarchy is the common denominator in all relationships. This allows her to dictate the condition of the character who is being subordinated. One way she infuses feminism into her stories is to always put males on the subordinated side of the spectrum. In “Ajustes S.A.” (in “Pasión de historias y historias de pasion”), the main purpose of the women-driven relationship "agency" is to lessen the male's condition. This imaginary agency trains wives to get rid of their well-behaved husbands, clearly a sign of feminism. Also, it is important to notice the female's level of authority. Females are able to excel at directing a single-sex agency whose main purpose is the subordination of the opposite sex. This power and constant abuse could be seen as an extreme case of feminism.
Another example of Vega's close connection to her writings appears in “Caso omiso” ("Case"). This story, also in the same book, recounts the erotic tale between an older woman and a teenage boy. From the start, the female obviously dictates the direction of the relationship. Confident about her abusive power, she reaches farther and tests her ex-husband's will of subordination.  However, the root of her power is her total control of the feelings of an obsessed teenage boy and a frustrated husband who cannot overcome the results of their separation. These short stories show the women's hierarchy plays in both relationships. Knowing her victim's feelings, she accommodates herself in the best possible position. This can be seen as another feminist element in her work.

==Reception of her work==

Vega's books are popular in Puerto Rico, but relatively unknown in the mainland United States. As of November 2013, few of her Spanish-language works had been translated into English, and "her catalog, whether in English or Spanish" was out of print.
