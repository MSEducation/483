It is the administrative centre for the Highland council area,The Highland Council website. Retrieved 6 March 2006. and is regarded as the capital of the Highlands of Scotland. Inverness lies near two important battle sites: the 11th century battle of Blàr nam Fèinne against Norway which took place on The Aird and the 18th century Battle of Culloden which took place on Culloden Moor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inverness-scotland.com/in-and-around-2-inverness.asp |title=Inverness city |publisher=Inverness-scotland.com |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl] It is the northernmost city in the United Kingdom and lies within the Great Glen (Gleann Mòr) at its north-eastern extremity where the River Ness enters the Moray Firth. At the latest, a settlement was established by the 6th century with the first royal charter being granted by Dabíd mac Maíl Choluim (King David I) in the 12th century. The Gaelic king Mac Bethad Mac Findláich (MacBeth) whose 11th Century murder of King Duncan was immortalised in Shakespeare's play, held a castle within the city where he ruled as Mormaer of Moray and Ross.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.loganair.co.uk/destinations/city-guides/inverness |title=Destinations :: City Guides :: Inverness |publisher=Loganair |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30[/tpl]

==History==

Inverness was one of the chief strongholds of the Picts, and in AD 565 was visited by St Columba with the intention of converting the Pictish king Brude, who is supposed to have resided in the vitrified fort on Craig Phadrig,[tpl]cite web|url=http://walking.visitscotland.com/walks/nescotland/213042 |title=Craig Phadrig, Inverness, Walk in Scotland, Visitscotland |publisher=Walking.visitscotland.com |date=27 March 2008 |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl] on the western edge of the city. A [tpl]convert|93|oz|kg|1|abbr=on[/tpl] silver chain dating to 500–800 was found just to the south of Torvean in 1983.[tpl]Cite journal | url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/13495/ | title=Site Record for Torvaine, Caledonian Canal, Inverness; Torvean | publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland [/tpl]. Silver chain was found at [tpl]gbmapping|NH65424346[/tpl] when digging the Caledonian Canal in 1809. A church or a monk's cell is thought to have been established by early Celtic monks on St Michael's Mount, a mound close to the river, now the site of the Old High Church[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.churchesinverness.com/Old-High-Church-g.asp |title=Inverness churches |publisher=Churchesinverness.com |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl] and graveyard. The castle is said to have been built by Máel Coluim III (Malcolm III) of Scotland, after he had razed to the ground the castle in which Mac Bethad mac Findláich (Macbeth) had, according to much later tradition, murdered Máel Coluim's father Donnchad (Duncan I), and which stood on a hill around 1 km to the north-east.
The strategic location of Inverness has led to many conflicts in the area. Reputedly there was a battle in the early 11th century between King Malcolm and Thorfinn of Norway at Blar Nam Feinne, to the southwest of the city.[tpl]Cite journal | url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/12728/ | title=Site Record for Blar Nam Feinne| publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland [/tpl]. Blar Nam Feinne is on Cnoc na Moine ([tpl]gbmapping|NH595433[/tpl]).
Inverness had four traditional fairs, including Legavrik or "Leth-Gheamhradh", meaning midwinter, and Faoilleach. William the Lion (d. 1214) granted Inverness four charters, by one of which it was created a royal burgh. Of the Dominican friary founded by Alexander III in 1233, only one pillar and a worn knight's effigy survive in a secluded graveyard near the town centre.
Medieval Inverness suffered regular raids from the Western Isles, particularly by the MacDonald Lords of the Isles in the fifteenth century. In 1187 one Domhnall Bán (Donald Bane) led islanders in a battle at Torvean against men from Inverness Castle led by the governor's son,  Donnchadh Mac An Toisich (Duncan Mackintosh).[tpl]Cite journal | url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/13540/ | title=Site Record for Torvaine, Torbane| publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland [/tpl].

The cairn at [tpl]gbmapping|NH65424346[/tpl] disappeared in the 19th or 20th centuries, it has also been claimed to mark the resting place of St Bean(Beóán) the Culdee. Local tradition says that the citizens fought off the Clan MacDonald in 1340 at the Battle of Blairnacoi on Drumderfit Hill, north of Inverness across the Beauly Firth.[tpl]Cite journal | url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/13574/ | title=Site Record for Battle Of Blairnacoi, Drumderfit Hill| publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland[/tpl] [tpl]gbmapping|NH656521[/tpl] On his way to the Battle of Harlaw in 1411, Donald of Islay harried the city, and sixteen years later James I held a parliament in the castle to which the northern chieftains were summoned, of whom three were executed for asserting an independent sovereignty. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl] Clan Munro defeated Clan Mackintosh in 1454 at the Battle of Clachnaharry just west of the city.[tpl]Cite journal | url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/13458/ | title=Site Record for Clachnaharry, Clan Battle Monument, Clachnaharry Memorial | publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland [/tpl]. Battle of Clachnaharry took place at [tpl]gbmapping|NH6454946448[/tpl]. The Clan MacDonald and their allies stormed the castle during the Raid on Ross in 1491.
In 1562, during the progress undertaken to suppress Huntly's insurrection, Mary, Queen of Scots, was denied admittance into Inverness Castle by the governor, who belonged to the earl's faction, and whom she afterwards caused to be hanged. The Clan Munro and Clan Fraser took the castle for her.George Buchanan's (1506 -1582), History of Scotland, completed in 1579, first published in 1582. The house in which she lived meanwhile stood in Bridge Street until the 1970s, when it was demolished to make way for the second Bridge Street development.
Beyond the then northern limits of the town, Oliver Cromwell built a citadel capable of accommodating 1,000 men, but with the exception of a portion of the ramparts it was demolished at the Restoration. The only surviving modern remnant is a clock tower.
Inverness played a role in the first Jacobite rising in 1689. In early May, it was besieged by a contingent of Jacobites led by MacDonnell of Keppoch. The town was actually rescued by Viscount Dundee, the overall Jacobite commander, when he arrived with the main Jacobite army, although he required Inverness to profess loyalty to King James VII.A. M. Scott, Bonnie Dundee (1989), pp. 104-105
In 1715 the Jacobites occupied the royal fortress as a barracks. In 1727 the government built the first Fort George here, but in 1746 it surrendered to the Jacobites and they blew it up.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/inverness/inverness/ |title=Inverness on Undiscovered Scotland |publisher=Undiscoveredscotland.co.uk |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl]
Culloden Moor lies nearby, and was the site of the Battle of Culloden in 1746, which ended the Jacobite Rising of 1745–1746.
On 7 September 1921, the first British Cabinet meeting to be held outside London took place in the Town House, when David Lloyd George, on holiday in Gairloch, called an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in Ireland. The Inverness Formula composed at this meeting was the basis of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

===Toponymy===

Inverness and its immediate hinterland have a large number of originally Gaelic place names as the area was solidly Gaelic-speaking until the late 19th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.polfest.org/vli/language/gaelic/pdfs/placenamesA-B.pdf |title=A'Chleit (Argyll), A' Chleit |format=PDF |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl]
Several springs which were traditionally thought to have healing qualities exist around Inverness. Fuaran Dearg, which translates as the "red spring" is a chalybeate spring located near Dochgarroch. Fuaran a' Chladaich (The Spring on the Beach) near Bunchrew was once accessed by a causeweay from the shore, although submerged at high tide it continues to bubble and was traditionally known for treating cholera. Fuaran Allt an Ionnlaid (Well of the Washing Burn) at Clachnaharry, where the Marquis of Montrose was allowed to drink while on his way from his capture in Sutherland to his execution in Edinburgh, was known for treating skin conditions. Also at Clachnaharry, Fuaran Priseag (The Precious Well) was said to have been blessed by Saint Kessock and could treat weak and sore eyes, as well as expelling evil and shielding curses if a silver coin was offered. Tobar na h-Oige (Well of the Young) is located near Culloden and was known for curing all ailments. Fuaran a' Chragan Bhreag (Well of the Speckled Rock) is located near Craig Dundain and Fuaran na Capaich (The Keppoch Well) is located near Culloden.http://archive.org/stream/reminiscencesofc00macluoft#page/104/mode/2up Although a Gaelic name itself, Craig Phadraig is alternatively known as Làrach an Taigh Mhóir, or "the place of the Great house.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/item/item_page.jsp?item_id=13088 |title=Transactions of the Inverness Scientific  Society and Field Club. vol.1 page 126 |publisher=Am Baile |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30[/tpl] "Several Gaelic place names are now largely obsolete due to the feature being removed or forgotten.

An Loch Gorm (The Turquoise Loch), a small sea loch which was situated beside Morrisons supermarket, was filled in during the 19th century and lives on only in the name of Lochgorm Warehouse. Abban Street stems from the word àban, a word of local Gaelic dialect meaning a small channel of water.

==Population==

The National Records of Scotland produce two population estimates,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/theme/population/estimates/special-area/settlements-localities/background.html |title=Mid-2010 Background Information on Settlements and Localities |publisher=General Register Office for Scotland (NRS) |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] one for the city of Inverness itself and one for the Greater Inverness urban area including the villages of Balloch, Culloden, Smithton, and Westhill. Prior to 2008 the Greater Inverness figure produced by National Records of Scotland only included Inverness and Westhill so the 1981 - 2006 Greater Inverness figures shown here are produced by combining the figures given for Inverness, Westhill and Culloden (which includes Balloch and Smithton).

==Geography==

Inverness is situated at the mouth of the River Ness (which flows from nearby Loch Ness) and at the southwestern extremity of the Moray Firth. The city lies at the end of the Great Glen with Loch Ness, Loch Ashie and Loch Duntelchaig to the west. Inverness' Caledonian Canal also runs through the Great Glen connecting Loch Ness, Loch Oich, and Loch Lochy.
The Ness Islands, a publicly owned park, consist of two wooded islands connected by footbridges and has been used as a place of recreation since the 1840s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nessriver.co.uk/pages/nessriver/nessIslands.html |title=River Ness - Inverness - Ness Islands |publisher=nessriver.co.uk |accessdate=25 August 2011[/tpl] Craig Phadraig, once an ancient Gaelic and Pictish hillfort is a 240 m[tpl]cite web |url=http://walking.visitscotland.com/perfect-walks/dunainhill-craigphadraig/ |title=Walk Scotland - Perfect Walks - Dunain Hill & Craig Phadraig |publisher=Walking.visitscotland.com |date=27 March 2008 |accessdate=25 August 2011 [/tpl] hill which offers hikes on a clear pathway through the wooded terrain.

===Location===

==Climate==

In common with all of the British Isles, Inverness has an oceanic climate. Its sheltered location makes it one of the driest areas in Scotland.[tpl]cite web | publisher = KNMI | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1971-2000&indexid=FD&stationid=1809 | title = Frost Incidence[/tpl]  Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year round.

==Health==

Raigmore is the main hospital in Inverness and the entire Highland authority.Welcome to NHS Highland[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl]  The present hospital opened in 1970, replacing wartime wards dating from 1941.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhshighland.scot.nhs.uk/Services/Pages/RaigmoreHospital.aspx |title=Raigmore Hospital |publisher=Nhshighland.scot.nhs.uk |date=3 March 1999 |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl]
Raigmore is also a teaching hospital catering for both the Universities of Aberdeen and Stirling. A new Centre for Health Science is located behind Raigmore Hospital. This is funded by Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the Scottish Executive and Johnson and Johnson. Phase I of this opened in early 2007, with phase II and phase III housing The Diabetes Institute opening in 2009. The University of Stirling moved its nursing and midwifery teaching operations from Raigmore Hospital to the CfHS. The UHI also has strong links with the centre through its Faculty of Health.

==Economy==

Most of the traditional industries such as distilling have been replaced by high-tech businesses, such as the design and manufacture of diabetes diagnostic kits. Highlands and Islands Enterprise has principally funded the Centre for Health Science to attracting more businesses in the medical and medical devices business to the area.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl] Inverness is home to Scottish Natural Heritage following that body's relocation from Edinburgh under the auspices of the Scottish Government's decentralisation strategy. SNH provides a large number of jobs in the area.
Inverness City Centre lies on the east bank of the river and is linked to the west side of the town by three road bridges – Ness Bridge, Friars Bridge and the Black (or Waterloo) Bridge – and by one of the town's suspension foot bridges, the Grieg Street Bridge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stockphotography.co.uk/UK/Maps/Inverness.asp |title=Inverness Town Centre Map |publisher=Stockphotography.co.uk |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl] The traditional city centre was a triangle bounded by High Street, Church Street and Academy Street, within which Union Street and Queensgate are cross streets parallel to High Street. Between Union Street and Queensgate is the Victorian Market, which contains a large number of small shops.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.explore-inverness.com/shops.htm |title=Inverness Shops |publisher=Explore-inverness.com |date=15 March 2010 |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl] The main Inverness railway station is almost directly opposite the Academy Street entrance to the Market. From the 1970s, the Eastgate Shopping Centre was developed to the east of High Street, with a substantial extension being completed in 2003.

==Education==

The city has a number of different education providers.  Inverness is catered for by about a dozen primary schools including Inverness Gaelic Primary School, a specialised institution situated at Slackbuie.  There are 5 secondary schools:  Inverness High School, Inverness Royal Academy, Charleston Academy, Millburn Academy and Culloden Academy.  Additionally there is Inverness College  which offers further and higher education courses to those of school leaving age and above. The City also has a new Centre for Health Sciences adjacent to Raigmore Hospital.

===University of the Highlands and Islands===

Inverness College is situated in the city and is a key part of the University of the Highlands and Islands, a federation of 15 colleges and research institutions in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland delivering higher education.
Plans for a new Business R&D and academic campus have been in place for some time with the college at its current Longman site  relocation to a new development at the new Inverness Campus at Beechwood Farm.
The planning application for phase 1 of a new campus, lodged by Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) was passed by The Highland Council in May 2010. The original outline planning application for the entire landholding submitted early 2009 remains live. This application forms a vision for the development over the next thirty years. The application includes:
The [tpl]convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] campus at Beechwood, just off the A9 south of Inverness, is considered to be one of the most important developments for the region over the next 20 years. The principal of UHI, James Fraser, said: “This is a flagship development which will provide Inverness with a university campus and vibrant student life. It will have a major impact on the city and on the Highlands and Islands. UHI is a partnership of colleges and research centres throughout the region, and the development of any one partner brings strength to the whole institution."[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]
It is estimated that the new campus would contribute more than £50m to the economy of the Highlands because it could attract innovative commercial businesses interested in research and development, while increasing the number of students who study within the city by around 3,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://invernesscampus.co.uk/ee/index.php/economic_benefits/ |title=Inverness Campus |publisher=Inverness Campus |date=22 June 2010 |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl]

==Transport==

Inverness is linked to the Black Isle across the Moray Firth by the Kessock Bridge.  It has a railway stationThe Highland Main Line, the Aberdeen-Inverness Line and the Far North Line meet at Inverness (Ordnance Survey [tpl]gbmapping|NH667454[/tpl]).  Also, Kyle of Lochalsh services run to and from Inverness via the Far North Line to Dingwall. with services to Perth, Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, Aberdeen, Thurso, Wick and to Kyle of Lochalsh. Inverness is connected to London by the Caledonian Sleeper, which departs six times a week and by the Highland Chieftain which runs 7 days a week. Inverness AirportOrdnance Survey grid reference for Inverness Airport (access from A96 road): [tpl]gbmappingsmall|NH776508[/tpl]. is located 15 km east of the city and has scheduled flights to airports across the UK including London, Manchester, Belfast and the islands to the north and west of Scotland. Flybe operate flights to Gatwick, Manchester, Belfast, Birmingham, Southampton and Jersey. Loganair, Flybe's franchise partner, operate Saab 340 aircraft to Stornoway, Kirkwall, Sumburgh, Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Three trunk roads (the A9, A82 and A96) provide access to Aberdeen, Perth, Elgin, Wick, Thurso, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Stagecoach Highlands  is the division of the Stagecoach Group which covers most of the former Rapson Group operations after the take-over by Stagecoach.
It covers the following depots of the Stagecoach Group.
There are various outstations over the division area due to the rural nature of the area covered.
The operation from Aviemore depot comes under the East Scotland division as it trades as Stagecoach in Inverness.

===Inverness Trunk Road Link===

Plans are in place to convert the A96 between Inverness and Nairn to a dual carriageway and to construct a southern bypass that would link the A9, A82 and A96 together involving crossings of the Caledonian Canal and the River Ness in the Torvean area, southwest of the town.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/yourcouncil/news/newsreleases/2007/March/2007-03-15-02.htm |title=The Highland Council website |publisher=Highland.gov.uk |date=16 March 2007 |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl]
The bypass, known as the Inverness Trunk Road Link (TRL), is aimed at resolving Inverness’s transport problems and has been split into two separate projects, the east and west sections. The east section will bypass Inshes Roundabout, a notorious traffic bottleneck, using a new road linking the existing Southern Distributor with the A9 and the A96, both via grade separated interchanges. This proposed new link road would bypass Inshes roundabout, as stated before, and separate strategic traffic from local traffic as well as accommodating proposals for new development at the West Seafield Retail and Business Park and also a new UHI campus.
At the west end, two options for crossing the river and canal were developed.  One involving a high level vertical opening bridge which will allow the majority of canal traffic to pass under without the need for opening.  The other involved a bridge over the river and an aqueduct under the canal.  Both of these designs are technically complex and were considered in detail along by the key stakeholders involved in the project. Ultimately it was decided that a bridge over the river and a tunnel under the canal were the best option, allow more expensive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/3995/Trunk_link_road_tunnel_to_cost__pound;85m.html |title=The Inverness Courier |publisher=The Inverness Courier |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl]
In late 2008 the controversial decision by the Scottish Government not to include the full Inverness bypass in its transport plan for the next 20 years was made. The government's Strategic Transport Projects Review did include the eastern section of the route, which will see the A9 at Inshes linked to the A96.
But the absence of the TRL's western section, which would include a permanent crossing over the Caledonian Canal and River Ness, sparked dismay among several Highland councillors and business leaders in Inverness who feel the bypass is vital for the city's future economic growth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/8355/Labour_to_quiz_Holyrood_government_on_TLR_funding.html |title=The Inverness Courier |publisher=The Inverness Courier |date=30 December 2008 |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl]

===Upgrading of the A9 South===

In late 2008 the Scottish Government's transport plan for the next 20 years was announced. It brings forward planned improvements to the A9 in an attempt to stimulate the economy and protect jobs.
Work costing a total of £8.5 million was undertaken at Moy, Carrbridge and Bankfoot. Northbound overtaking lanes were created and the carriageway was reconstructed at both Moy and Carrbridge. Junction improvements were also made at Moy.
In November 2011 the Scottish Government announced that it will upgrade the entire road from Perth to Inverness to dual carriageway. Work on this project is expected to start in 2015 is scheduled to be completed in 2025, at a cost of £3 billion.http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/road/projects/a9
In July 2013, the Scottish Government announced a plan to install average speed cameras on the A9 between Perth and Inverness. This has been undertaken with an aim to reduce accidents and fatalities on the road, and will be the second permanent average speed camera scheme in Scotland.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-23462860 | work=BBC News | title=Average speed cameras for A9 from Dunblane to Inverness | date=26 July 2013[/tpl]

==Politics 2002–2012==

===Local government===

Inverness was an autonomous royal burgh, and county town for the county of Inverness (also known as Inverness-shire) until 1975, when local government counties and burghs were abolished, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, in favour of two-tier regions and districts and unitary islands council areas. The royal burgh was then absorbed into a new district of Inverness, which was one of eight districts within the Highland region. The new district combined in one area the royal burgh, the Inverness district of the county and the Aird district of the county.  The rest of the county was divided between other new districts within the Highland region  and the Western Isles. Therefore, although much larger than the royal burgh, the new Inverness district was much smaller than the county.
In 1996, under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/Ukpga_19940039_en_1.htm |title=Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994, Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) website |publisher=OPSI |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl] the districts were abolished and the region became a unitary council area. The new unitary Highland Council, however, adopted the areas of the former districts as council management areas, and created area committees to represent each. The Inverness committee represented 23 out of the 80 Highland Council wards, with each ward electing one councillor by the first past the post system of election. Management area and committee area boundaries later became disconnected as a result of changes to ward boundaries in 1999. Ward boundaries changed again in2007, and the council management areas were replaced with three new corporate management areas.
Ward boundary changes in 2007, under the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2004/20040009.htm |title=Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) website |publisher=OPSI |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl] created 22 new Highland Council wards, each electing three or four councillors by the single transferable vote system of election, a system designed to produce a form of proportional representation. The total number of councillors remaining the same. Also, the Inverness management area was merged into the new Inverness, Nairn and Badenoch and Strathspey corporate management area, covering nine of the new wards and electing 34 of the 80 councillors. As well as the Inverness area, the new area includes the former  Nairn management area and the former Badenoch and Strathspey management area. The corporate area name is also that of a constituency, but boundaries are different.
Within the corporate area there is a city management area covering seven of the nine wards, the Aird and Loch Ness ward, the Culloden and Ardersier ward, the Inverness Central ward, the Inverness Millburn ward, the Inverness Ness-side ward, the Inverness South ward and the Inverness West ward. The Nairn ward and the Badenoch and Strathspey ward complete the corporate area. Wards in the city management area are to be represented on a city committee as well as corporate area committees.

===City status===

In 2001 city status was granted to the Town of Inverness, and letters patent were taken into the possession of the Highland Council by the convener of the Inverness area committee.Helen Liddell joins Inverness celebrations as Scotland’s Millennium City, Scotland Office press release 19 March 2001[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl] These letters patent, which were sealed in March 2001 and are held by Inverness Museum and Art Gallery,Ordnance Survey grid reference for Inverness Museum and Art Gallery: [tpl]gbmappingsmall|NH666451[/tpl] create a city of Inverness, but do not refer to anywhere with defined boundaries, except that Town of Inverness may be taken as a reference to the burgh of Inverness. As a local government area the burgh was abolished 26 years earlier, in 1975, and so was the county of Inverness for which the burgh was the county town.  Nor do they refer to the former district or to the royal burgh.
The Highland area was created as a two-tier local government region in 1975, and became a unitary local government area in 1996. The region consisted of eight districts, of which one was called Inverness. The districts were all merged into the unitary area. As the new local government authority, the Highland Council then adopted the areas of the districts as council management areas. The management areas were abolished in 2007, in favour of three new corporate management areas. The council has defined a large part of the Inverness, Nairn and Badenoch and Strathspey corporate area as the Inverness city management area.Key Decisions Taken on Council Post 2007, Highland Council news release, 15 December 2006, includes a list of wards within the Inverness management area This council-defined city area includes Loch Ness and numerous towns and villages apart from the former burgh of Inverness.
In January 2008 a petition to matriculate armorial bearings for the City of Inverness was refused by Lord Lyon King of Arms on the grounds that there is no legal persona to which arms can be granted.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/News/Coat-of-arms-rejected-in-city-status-query-5000.htm |title=Coat of arms rejected in city status query |work=The Inverness Courier |date=29 January 2008 |accessdate=16 October 2012[/tpl]

===Parliamentary representation===

There are three existing parliamentary constituencies with Inverness as an element in their names:
These existing constituencies are effectively subdivisions of the Highland council area, but boundaries for Westminster elections are now very different from those for Holyrood elections. The Holyrood constituencies are also subdivisions of the Highlands and Islands electoral region.
Historically there have been six Westminster constituencies:
Inverness Burghs was a district of burghs constituency, covering the parliamentary burghs of Inverness, Fortrose, Forres and Nairn. Inverness-shire covered, at least nominally, the county of Inverness minus the Inverness parliamentary burgh. As created in 1918, Inverness covered the county minus Outer Hebridean areas, which were merged into the Western Isles constituency. The Inverness constituency included the former parliamentary burgh of Inverness. As created in 1983, Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber was one of three constituencies covering the Highland region, which had been created in 1975. As first used in 1997, the Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber, and Ross, Skye and Inverness West constituencies were effectively two of three constituencies covering the Highland unitary council area, which had been created in 1996.

==Culture and sports==

Inverness is an important centre for bagpipe players and lovers, since every September the city hosts the Northern Meeting. The Inverness cape, a garment worn in the rain by pipers the world over, is not necessarily made in Inverness.
Another major event in calendar is the annual City of Inverness Highland Games. The event can trace its roots back to one of the first Highland Games staged in the modern era; the True Highland Games which was staged in 1822 by members of the Northern Meeting Society. In 1864 the Northern Meeting Society built the world's first Highland Games stadium, the Northern Meeting Park. The last Northern Meeting Highland Games was staged in 1938 and following the second world war, responsibility for the organisation of the annual event passed to the Town Council who moved the event to Bught Park in 1948. In 2006 Inverness hosted Scotland's biggest ever Highland Games over two days in July, featuring the Masters' World Championships, the showcase event for heavies aged over 40 years. 2006 was the first year that the Masters' World Championships had been held outside the United States, and it attracted many top heavies from around the world to the Inverness area. The Masters World Championships returned in 2009 when it was staged as part of the Homecoming celebrations. In 2010, the City of Inverness Highland Games returned to Northern Meeting Park where it remains to this day.
The main theatre in Inverness is called Eden Court Theatre. Actress Karen Gillan is the ambassador for Theatre Art Education.
The current music scene within Inverness generally leans towards an emo/punk/hardcore style, but there are also bands who show features of different genres such as rock, metal, pop, classical, grunge, industrial and traditional Scottish music.
Inverness is home to two summer music festivals, Rockness and the Tartan Heart Festival, that bring a variety of different music to the town.

===Gaelic in Inverness===

Historically, Inverness had a solidly Gaelic speaking population, with the majority of the population having Gaelic as their first language. From approximately the end of the 19th century, following the 1872 Education Act, Inverness suffered a decline in the number of Gaelic speakers in line with the rest of the once Gaidhealtachd / Scottish Highlands. Despite the local dialect of Scottish Gaelic gradually falling out of use (although it continued to affect local English language dialect), the language is still spoken in other dialects and standardised forms. By the end of the 19th century, some rural areas to the south east of Inverness still had completely Gaelic speaking populations, such as Strath Dearn where almost 100% of the population were still Gaelic speaking.
1677: Inverness was described as "overwhelmingly" Gaelic speaking by the traveller Thomas Kirk.
1704: Close to 100% of the population was fluent in Gaelic, with 57% of the city's population speaking only Gaelic and the remaining 43% also having some understanding of the Scots language. Edward Lhuyd published major work on Inverness Gaelic and after collecting data from between 1699 and 1700, his findings showed a distinct dialect in the area.Campbell, JL & Thomson, D. Edward Lhuyd in the Scottish Highlands 1699–1700 Oxford (1963) The clear dialect of Inverness Gaelic was held in high regard by speakers of other forms, such as those from Lewis, Sutherland and Ross.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8bmTUD5hiA4C&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=%22long+island%22+%22Sutherland+Gaelic%22&source=bl&ots=h71ccLyEWY&sig=QrN-RaaTZ6zfjbTgplSVKUiNQ1A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=H_hHT6CbN43D8QPUoZGtDg&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22long%20island%22%20%22Sutherland%20Gaelic%22&f=false |title=Popular Tales of the West Highlands|first= J F |last=Campbell|publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30[/tpl] Gaelic remained the principal language of Invernessians for the rest of the 18th century, despite growing pressure from outwith the Highlands in both political and social contexts.
1798: Thomas Garnett (Professor of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry in the Royal Institution of Great Britain) observed that Inverness had become largely bilingual with Invernessians using Gaelic as the language of the home but English as the language of foreign trade – however, the older generation at the time generally only had the Gaelic. Speaking of those in the countryside immediately surrounding Inverness, Garnett stated that although in Inverness both Gaelic and English “are spoken promiscuously...the language of the country people is Gaelic.”
1828: John Wood praised the standard of both the Gaelic and English spoken in Inverness stating that both languages were spoken with "utmost purity." He noted that children would casually flit between the two languages while playing, asking questions in Gaelic while receiving answers in English and vice-versa.
1882: The Celtic Magazine, published in Inverness, complained that enumerators of the 1881 census who assessed whether families were Gaelic speaking, English speaking or both, had supplied false information. The magazine wrote that "whole families .... scarcely any member of whom can express the commonest idea intelligently in English – who are in every sense Gaelic-speaking people only – were returned by the enumerators as English-speaking."
1901: Inhabitants of Inverness voiced regret at the very swift decay of the native language in the short space of twenty years following a complete absence of bilingual education and disregard for Gaelic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/transactions83unkngoog/transactions83unkngoog_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Transactions" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30[/tpl]
For its size, Inverness today still has a relatively high density of Gaelic speakers and a relatively lively Gaelic scene, making it one of the centres of the Scottish Gaelic Renaissance. According to the 2001 census, 5.47% spoke Gaelic (approx. 2,200 speakers), compared to 1.2% nationally.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scrol.gov.uk/scrol/browser/profile.jsp?profile=Population&mainArea=Inverness&mainLevel=Locality&compArea=Scotland&compLevel=CountryProfile&mainTextExplicitMatch=true&compTextExplicitMatch=true |title=Gaelic in Inverness |publisher=General Register Office for Scotland |accessdate=13 October 2010[/tpl] The number of Gaelic speakers has fluctuated over the last century. In 1881, the census reported 4,047 Gaelic speakers in Inverness (23.3% of the population) which by 1891 had risen to 6,356 speakers (30.47%).Withers, C. Gaelic in Scotland (1984) John Donald Publishers ISBN 0-85976-097-9 By 1901 this figure had dropped to 5,072 speakers (23.88%) of the population, from which it continued to drop to present day numbers through emigration and language shift. Scottish Gaelic is slowly re-appearing in the linguistic landscape, appearing on some signs around Inverness. Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Inbhir Nis, which opened in August 2007 offering primary school education through the medium of Gaelic, is nearing full capacity and was extended to allow for more pupils in August 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cnp-inbhirnis.com/1/post/2009/11/gaelic-primary-school-education-set-to-expand-in-inverness-area-121109.html |title=Gaelic Primary School education set to expand in Inverness area (12/11/09) – Comann Nam Pàrant – Inbhir Nis |publisher=Cnp-inbhirnis.com |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl] Bòrd na Gàidhlig, an organisation responsible for supporting and promoting the use of Scottish Gaelic, has its main office in Inverness.Bòrd na Gàidhlig [tpl]gd icon[/tpl] Other Gaelic related groups include the Inverness Gaelic Choir which has existed for over 70 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://invernessgaelicchoir.com/?page_id=2 |title=About Inverness Gaelic Choir |publisher=Inverness Gaelic Choir |accessdate=13 October 2010[/tpl] Inverness will also host the Royal National Mòd in 2014, a festival celebrating Gaelic culture.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/inverness/Inverness-set-to-host-Mod.6584066.jp |title=Inverness to host the Royal National Mòd |publisher=Scotsman Newspaper|date= 16 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010 |location=Edinburgh |first=Frank |last=Urquhart[/tpl]

===Buildings===

Important buildings in Inverness include Inverness Castle, and various churches.
The castle was built in 1835 on the site of its medieval predecessor. It is now a sheriff court.
Inverness Cathedral, dedicated to St Andrew, is a cathedral of the Scottish Episcopal Church and seat of the ordinary of the Diocese of Moray, Ross and Caithness. The cathedral has a curiously square-topped look to its spires, as funds ran out before they could be completed.
The oldest church is the Old High Church,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oldhighststephens.com/location// |title=Old High Church information|publisher=www.oldhighststephens.com |accessdate=19 June 2013[/tpl] on St Michael's Mount by the riverside, a site perhaps used for worship since Celtic times. The church tower dates from mediaeval times, making it the oldest surviving building in Inverness. It is used by the Church of Scotland congregation of Old High St Stephen's, Inverness,[tpl]cite web|url=http://oldhighststephens.com/ |title=Old High St Stephen's website |publisher=Oldhighststephens.com |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl] and it is the venue for the annual Kirking of the Council, which is attended by local councillors.
There is no Catholic cathedral in the area as the Diocese's cathedral (St Mary) is at Aberdeen, the seat of the Diocese of Aberdeen. The Catholic population is served by two parish churches: St Mary's Church, founded in 1837, is the older of the two and the first Catholic church founded in Inverness since the Reformation.The Story of St. Mary’s Catholic Church Inverness - St Mary's Inverness official website St Ninian's was built during the 1960s and 1970s.St Ninian's - Story
