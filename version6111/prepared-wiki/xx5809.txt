CATEGORIES: Protein-energy malnutrition

Kwashiorkor [tpl]IPAc-en|k|w|ɑː|ʃ|i|ˈ|ɔr|k|ər[/tpl]  is a form of severe protein-energy malnutrition characterized by edema, irritability, anorexia, ulcerating dermatoses, and an enlarged liver with fatty infiltrates. Sufficient calorie intake, but with insufficient protein consumption, distinguishes it from marasmus. Kwashiorkor cases occur in areas of famine or poor food supply.[tpl]cite book|last=Krebs NF, Primak LE, Hambridge KM|title=Normal childhood nutrition & its disorders.

In at-risk populations, kwashiorkor may develop after a mother weans her child from breast milk, replacing it with a diet high in carbohydrates, especially starches, but deficient in protein.

==Signs and symptoms==

Kwashiorkor is preventable, categorized by ICD-9 as disease category 260, other severe protein-calorie malnutrition. The defining sign of kwashiorkor in a malnourished child is pedal edema (swelling of the ankles and feet).  Other signs include a distended abdomen, an enlarged liver with fatty infiltrates, thinning hair, loss of teeth, skin depigmentation and dermatitis. Children with kwashiorkor often develop irritability and anorexia.
Victims of kwashiorkor fail to produce antibodies following vaccination against diseases, including diphtheria and typhoid.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=14037411 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14037411 |year=1962 |last1=Pretorius |first1=PJ |last2=De Villiers |first2=LS |title=Antibody response in children with protein malnutrition |volume=10 |pages=379–83 |journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition[/tpl] Generally, the disease can be treated by adding protein to the diet; however, it can have a long-term impact on a child's physical and mental development, and in severe cases may lead to death.
In dry climates, marasmus is the more frequent disease associated with malnutrition. Another malnutrition syndrome includes cachexia, although it is often caused by underlying illnesses.  These are important considerations in the treatment of the patients.
