The purpose of the foundation is to run and fund Carlsberg Laboratory, the museum at Frederiksborg Palace, to fund scientific research, run the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek and via the Tuborg Foundation to fund social works and support other works beneficial to society.

==History==

The foundation was started to run Carlsberg Laboratory. To finance its works the foundation received a portion of shares in Carlsberg Brewery. J.C. Jacobsen's wish was to create a foundation with firm obligations to the natural sciences and direct responsibility for the running of a corporate enterprise. In 1878 the foundation started to manage and fund the Museum of National History at Frederiksborg Palace. In 1882 after the death of J. C. Jacobsen the foundation inherited the remaining shares in the brewery. In 1902 Carl Jacobsen (J. C. Jacobsen's son) started the "New Carlsberg Foundation" to run his brewery, New Carlsberg. When the old and new Brewery merged, the obligations of New Carlsberg Foundation were added to those of the Carlsberg foundation, including the management and funding of Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek. In 1931 the foundation started a Scholarship programme named after J. C. Jacobsen. The foundation sponsored the Danish excavation of Tell Shemshara in Iraq in 1957.[tpl]citation |last=Mortensen |first=Peder |title=Tell Shimshara.
