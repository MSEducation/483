==Career==

Schoolly D teamed up with DJ Code Money in the mid-1980s. His lyrics reflected urban realism, violence, and sexual bravado, making Schoolly D an early gangsta rapper. He later embraced an Afrocentric style, bringing Afrocentric culture to hip hop along with KRS-One.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429824/20000214/guru.jhtml |title= KRS-One, Schoolly D, Guru Tapped For "Once In The Life" |accessdate= 9 September 2010|last=Basham  |first=David |coauthors= |date=February 14, 2000 |work= |publisher=MTV.com [/tpl]
Schoolly D contributed songs and music to many Abel Ferrara films, such as "P.S.K." as well as "Saturday Night" (from Saturday Night! – The Album), as well as the title track from Am I Black Enough For You? which was played during the climactic shoot-out in Ferrara's King of New York; the title track of this movie from How a Black Man Feels and "Signifying Rapper" (from Schoolly's album Smoke Some Kill), which was used in the director's Bad Lieutenant.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22601 |title=Interview with Abel Ferrara |accessdate=2008-07-25 |last=Tobias |first=Scott |coauthors= |date=November 27, 2002 |work= |publisher=The A.V. Club[/tpl] Because Led Zeppelin successfully sued due to an uncleared interpolation  of its song "Kashmir" in "Signifying Rapper," the song was omitted from the soundtrack of the film and from subsequent releases of the film.
Composer Joe Delia tapped Schoolly to co-write and record "The Player" for Ferrara's film The Blackout, which Delia scored.  Schoolly also wrote the score to Ferrara's 'R Xmas. In 2006, Schoolly D co-wrote the indie film soundtrack of the historical science fiction thriller Order of the Quest with Chuck Treece. The project series is produced by Benjamin Barnett, and Jay D Clark of Media Bureau. His last album, Funk 'N Pussy, features guest appearances by Public Enemy's Chuck D, Chuck Chillout, Lady B and a drum and bass remix of the classic Schoolly D track "Mr. Big Dick" (remixed by UK trip-hop crew The Sneaker Pimps).
Schoolly also performed the music and occasional narration for the cult animated series Aqua Teen Hunger Force on the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block. He was a guest on an episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast.  He also created the song "Sharkian Nights" for the 12 oz. Mouse. The character Jesse B. Weaver from The Rudy and Gogo World Famous Cartoon Show was also named after him.
In November 2006 Schoolly D and Cartoon Network were sued over the Aqua Teen Hunger Force theme music. A drummer by the name of Terence Yerves claimed he had also written the theme music alongside Schoolly D in 1999 while working at the Meat Locker Studio. Yerves was aware the song would be used for a television series but did not approve of it being used for Aqua Teen Hunger Force, however, did not file the copyright to the Library Of Congress until May 2006, after the series' fourth season had already started airing. In the lawsuit Yerves demanded he receive 150,000 for every time the series was aired after the lawsuit was filled, he also demanded that all existing copies of the series' DVDs be impounded and for Aqua Teen Hunger Force to cease broadcast.[tpl]cite web|last=Ryan|first=Kyle|title=Aqua Teen Hunger Force sued over theme song|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/aqua-teen-hunger-force-sued-over-theme-song,15851/|publisher=The AV Club|date=10 November 2006|accessdate=29 July 2013[/tpl]
