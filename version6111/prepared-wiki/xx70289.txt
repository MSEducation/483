Studies allowing views inside the plane of the membrane of gap junctions during formation indicated that a "formation plaque" formed between two cells prior to the connexins moving in. They were particle free areas when observed by TEM FF indicating very small or no transmembrane proteins were likely present. Little is known about what structures make up the formation plaque or how the formation plaque's structure changes when connexins and other components move in or out. One of the earlier studies of the formation of small gap junctions describes rows of particles and particle free halos.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 4135001 | pmc=2109180 | volume=62 | issue=1 | title=Assembly of gap junctions during amphibian neurulation |date=July 1974 | journal=J.

The particulate gap junctions were thought to form 4–6 hours after the formation plaques appeared.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 1083855 | pmc=2109697 | volume=69 | issue=3 | title=Hormonal regulation of gap junction differentiation |date=June 1976 | journal=J.

]]  The formation plaque and non-connexin part of the classical gap junction plaque have been difficult for early researchers to analyse. It appears in TEM FF and thin section to be a lipid membrane domain that can somehow form a comparatively rigid barrier to other lipids and proteins. There has been indirect evidence for certain lipids being preferentially involved with the formation plaque but this cannot be considered definitive.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 1698798 | volume=96 | title=Increased gap junction assembly between cultured cells upon cholesterol supplementation |date=June 1990 | journal=J.

E.[/tpl] It is difficult to envisage breaking up the membrane to analyse membrane plaques without affecting their composition. By study of connexins still in membranes lipids associated with the connexins have been studied.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 19686581 | doi=10.1186/1741-7007-7-52 | volume=7 | title=Connexin channels and phospholipids: association and modulation | pmc=2733891 | year=2009 | journal=BMC Biol. | pages=52 | last1 = Locke | first1 = Darren | last2 = Harris | first2 = Andrew L[/tpl] It was found that specific connexins tended to associate preferentially with specific phospholipids. As formation plaques precede connexins these results still give no certainty as to what is unique about the composition of plaques themselves. Other findings show connexins associate with protein scaffolds used in another junction, the zonula occludens ZO1.[ref][tpl]cite journal |author=Li X, Kamasawa N, Ciolofan C, et al. |title=Connexin45-containing neuronal gap junctions in rodent retina also contain connexin36 in both apposing hemiplaques, forming bihomotypic gap junctions, with scaffolding contributed by zonula occludens-1 |journal=J.

[/ref] While this helps us understand how connexins may be moved into a gap junction formation plaque the composition of the plaque itself is still somewhat sketchy. Some headway on the in vivo composition of the gap junction plaque is being made using TEM FRIL.
