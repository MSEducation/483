Hired Gun was a medium sized development team created internally within Microsoft Studios, headed by project leader Jo Clowes.  The team worked on the port of Halo 2 from its original Xbox edition, to a new and improved Windows Vista exclusive.
The team consisted of approximately 50 members, divided between port coding, the development of the map editor and new multiplayer maps, as well as software testing.
Their project, which became dubbed "Halo 2 Vista" or "H2V", was developed between early February 2006 and April 2007.  Hired Gun provided patch support for the game up until October 2007, after which the team were dissolved and redistributed within Microsoft Studios to work on other projects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://forums.haloonwindowsvista.com/forums/3/6084/ShowThread.aspx|title=Halo On Windows Vista - was that a patch|date=2007-11-06|quote=Correct, the Hired Gun team no longer exists, but that doesn't necessarily mean all support has been dropped.
