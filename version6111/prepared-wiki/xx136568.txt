==History==

MIT's Chemistry department has been around since the Institute opened its doors in 1865.  It started with two professors, Charles W. Eliot and Francis H. Storer, and a class of 15 students.
In 1866, the department moved to its new quarters in the basement of the Rogers Building in Boston.  Cyrus Warren joined the faculty, and became MIT's first professor of organic chemistry.
In 1907, MIT awarded its first Ph.D. to three students in the field of physical chemistry.
