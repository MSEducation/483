This is a complete list of episodes for the BBC Three supernatural drama-comedy television series Being Human.  The original premise of the series was that a ghost, a vampire, and a werewolf became friends and began living together in a house in Bristol.  All three characters appear to be in their 20s.  The programme's original cast included Lenora Crichlow as Annie the ghost, Russell Tovey as George the werewolf, and Aidan Turner as Mitchell the vampire.
For series 3, Sinead Keenan was promoted from a supporting to a main character as George's werewolf girlfriend, Nina, and the characters and the show's location moved to Barry, Vale of Glamorgan. Turner left the show at the end of series 3, and his character was killed off. On 11 November 2011, Russell Tovey announced that he was leaving Being Human during series 4 to work full-time on his other show, Him & Her,Iqbal, Nosheen. "Russell Tovey: Why I'm Leaving Being Human (and Loving Him & Her)." The Guardian. 11 November 2011. Accessed 2011-11-12. and he appeared in the first episode only. Keenan also did not return to the series. Damien Molony was introduced as vampire Hal, with Michael Socha's previously recurring role as werewolf Tom promoted to the main cast. Series 4 also introduced Kate Bracken as Alex, who soon becomes a ghost and takes Annie's place in the household at the conclusion of the series when the latter passes over into the afterlife.
A pilot and 36 episodes have aired. Series 4 premiered on 5 February 2012. Originally, the pilot episode and all episodes of Series 1 and 2 were untitled. Semi-official names have since been provided via a competition run by series creator Toby Whithouse via his blog.[tpl]cite web|author=Rebecca Denton, Online Exec |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/beinghuman/2011/09/tobys_blog_2.html |title=Names for pilot episode and first two series' episodes |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01[/tpl]

==Summary==

==Pilot (2008)==

==Series 1 (2009)==

The series dealt with a supernatural threat, Herrick, a Vampire Leader. The cast and tone of Being Human changed between the pilot and the series. Compared to the pilot, producer Matthew Bouch described the series as "less gothic and slightly more rooted" as well as "a bit funnier"; he also described the series as "kind of a reboot" of the pilot. Writer Toby Whithouse, however, said that he does consider the pilot to be canonical.
Interior shots of Mitchell, Annie, and George's home, the hospital, and the vampires' funeral home headquarters were filmed on sound stages with exterior shots filmed on location. The funeral parlour's exterior and reception room were filmed in an old car showroom in Bristol, while the back rooms were filmed in a television studio.
To promote the show, the BBC launched a blog, and on 22 December 2008, the BBC Being Human web page aired three prequel videos to introduce the three main characters: Mitchell's is set in the 1960s, George's is a video diary of his visit of Scotland, and Annie's shows her as a ghost terrorizing a couple who had moved into the house. Series one of Being Human premiered in the US on 25 July 2009 on BBC America and on 4 August on Fox in Portugal.
Metacritic assigned a rating of 79 out of 100 based on 8 critical reviews, with reviews averaging 7.8 out of 10.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/being-human-uk|title=Being Human (UK): Series 1|work=Metacritic|accessdate=7 March 2011[/tpl]

==Series 2 (2010)==

Series two began filming in August 2009, and began airing in the UK on 10 January 2010. It was expanded to eight episodes, with series creator Toby Whithouse writing the first two and last two episodes. The pre-credit sequences followed a new pattern: from episode two onwards each one depicts something from the history of either the main cast or other characters. A prequel posted on the BBC website introduced two new vampire characters: Ivan and Daisy.  BBC America began transmitting Series 2 on 24 July 2010.
This series was concerned with a human threat, CenSAA.

==Series 3 (2011)==

Series 3 premiered in the United Kingdom on 23 January 2011, and contained eight episodes.

Lacey Turner played the recurring character Lia, a ghost encountered by Mitchell when he travelled to "the other side" in an attempt to rescue Annie from purgatory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/beinghuman/2010/06/lacey_turner_to_star_in_being.html|title=Lacey Turner to Star in Being Human 3|date=20 June 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2011[/tpl]
