Montgomery County, locally also referred to as Montco, is a county located in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  in the United States.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 799,874,[tpl]cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/42/42091.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 20, 2013[/tpl] making it the third most populous county in Pennsylvania, after Philadelphia and Allegheny counties. The county seat is Norristown.[tpl]GR|6[/tpl] Montgomery County is very diverse, ranging from farms and open land in Upper Hanover to densely populated rowhouse streets in Cheltenham.
The county was created on September 10, 1784, out of land originally part of Philadelphia County. The first courthouse was housed in the Barley Sheaf Inn.  It is believed to have been named either for Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 while attempting to capture Quebec City, Canada, or for the Welsh county of Montgomeryshire (which was named after one of William the Conqueror's main counselors, Roger de Montgomerie), as it was part of the Welsh Tract, an area of Pennsylvania settled by Quakers from Wales. Early histories of the county indicate the origin of the county's name as uncertain.
Montgomery County is a suburban county northwest of Philadelphia. It is part of the Delaware Valley and marks the region's northern border, with the Lehigh Valley region of the state to the north. In 2010 it was the 51st wealthiest county in the country (measured by median household income). In 2008 it was named the 9th Best Place to Raise a Family by Forbes.forbes.com

==Economy==

Montgomery County is a suburb of Philadelphia and consequently, many of its residents work in the city. However, Montco is also a major employment center with large business parks in Blue Bell, Lansdale, Fort Washington, Horsham and King of Prussia which attract thousands of workers from all over the region. The strong job base and taxes generated by those jobs have resulted in Montgomery County receiving the highest credit rating of 'AAA' from Standard & Poor's, one of fewer than 30 counties in the United States with such a rating."Montgomery County," Rydal-Meadowbrook Civic Association

==Politics==

As of January 2010, there are 577,378 registered voters in Montgomery County.Running for Office
Historically, Montgomery County was a stronghold for the Republican Party.  The county was the only one carried by Barbara Hafer in the 1990 gubernatorial election over the incumbent governor, Bob Casey. However, the Democratic Party has made substantial gains in the county over the last quarter-century and gained the registration edge early in 2008.  This is mainly because the brand of Repubilcanism practiced in the county has traditionally been a moderate one.  As the national party veered rightward, the county's voters became more willing to support Democrats at the national level.  After voting for the Republican Presidential nominee in all but one election from 1952 to 1988, the Democratic Presidential nominee has carried Montgomery for the past six consecutive elections, with the margins progressively increasing between 1992 and 2008, however decreasing in 2012. 
Most county-level offices were held by Republicans until after the 2007 election, when Democrats picked up control of five row offices.  Democrats have also won several elections in the Pennsylvania General Assembly in recent years, including two GOP-leaning State House districts in 2004, the 148th with Mike Gerber and the 153rd with Josh Shapiro.  Today, although the county is very Democratic at the national level, at the state and local level it is more of a tossup.
In the 2004 US Senate election, Republican Arlen Specter won the county over Montco resident Joe Hoeffel, but Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. out-polled Rick Santorum in the 2006 Senate election. In 2006, Democrat Rick Taylor unseated incumbent Republican Eugene McGill in the 151st (although Taylor lost in 2010 to Republican Todd Stephens) and, in 2008, Democrat Matthew Bradford unseated incumbent Republican Jay Moyer in the 70th. Six of the county's 12 state house seats and four of the county's eight senate seats are now held by Democrats. All four statewide Democratic candidates carried Montgomery in 2008, with Barack Obama receiving 60% of the county's vote.
Barack Obama won Montgomery County in 2008 and 2012, however Republicans hold many local offices in the county.
Montgomery County is governed by a three-person County Commission.  The current composition is two Democrats and one Republican.  By law, the County Commission must have one member of a minority party represented.

===Same-sex marriage===

On July 24, 2013, Montgomery County Register of Wills D. Bruce Hanes, a Democrat, announced he would begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, flouting Pennsylvania law banning such unions. Hanes called the commonwealth's ban "arbitrary and suspect", saying he believes it violates the Pennsylvania Constitution and the United States Constitution. The Republican administration of Governor Tom Corbett filed suit in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania in an attempt to block Hanes from licensing same-sex marriage, although Hanes has asked that the case be heard by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court instead.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/19/pennsylvania-gay-marriage_n_3781645.html|agency=The Huffington Post|date=19 August 2013|accessdate=26 August 2013|title=Pennsylvania Gay Marriage Law Deemed 'Suspect' By County Official[/tpl]
