AC/DC are an Australian hard rock band formed in Sydney, Australia in 1973 by brothers Angus and Malcolm Young. Although the band are considered pioneers of heavy metal,[tpl]cite encyclopedia | editor = Dale Hoiberg | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite | title = AC/DC | edition = 2008 | date = 2007-09-24 | volume= | isbn = 1-59339-292-3 | pages= [/tpl][tpl]cite encyclopedia | editor = Dale Hoiberg | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite | title = heavy metal | edition = 2008 | date = 2007-09-24 | volume= | isbn = 1-59339-292-3 | pages= [/tpl] its members have always classified their music as "rock 'n' roll".[tpl]cite book | first = Murray | last = Engleheart | title = AC/DC - Bonfire | date = 1997-11-18 [/tpl] AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, in 1975. Membership remained stable until bassist Cliff Williams replaced Mark Evans in 1977. In 1979, the band recorded their highly successful album Highway to Hell. Lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980, after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group briefly considered disbanding, but soon ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was selected as Scott's replacement. Later that year, the band released their best-selling album, Back in Black. The band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was also highly successful and was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after the departure of drummer Phil Rudd in 1983. Poor record sales continued until the release of The Razors Edge in 1990. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip was released in 2000 and was well received by critics. The band's new album Black Ice was announced in June 2008 and was released on October 20, 2008. The album's first single, "Rock 'N Roll Train", earned AC/DC a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Group or Duo with Vocals. Another Black Ice track, "War Machine," gained AC/DC their first Grammy Award win, for Best Hard Rock Performance.
From 1982 to 1991, AC/DC have received several nominations from awards ceremonies for their music. The American Music Awards nominated the band for Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group. The group received several nominations from the Grammy Awards, including Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance for "Blow Up Your Video" in 1989, and Best Hard Rock Performance for three songs in different years: "The Razors Edge" in 1991, "Moneytalks" in 1992, and "Highway To Hell" in 1994. The band also received the nomination for Best Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Video for "Thunderstruck" in 1991 from the MTV Video Music Awards.
In 2009 AC/DC received four nominations for their 2008 album Black Ice in the ARIA Music Awards which included Best Rock Album, Highest Selling Album, Best Group and Best Album. They won the awards for Best Rock Album and Highest Selling Album. Overall, AC/DC have received thirteen nominations and have won three awards.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2008-10-07|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-a/acdc.htm|title=AC/DC |publisher=Rock on the Net [/tpl]
