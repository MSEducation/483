==Grades and precedence==

The Canadian monarch—presently Queen Elizabeth II—is seen as the fount of honour[tpl]Citation| url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/hon/nat-honour-honneur/index-eng.htm| last=Royal Canadian Mounted Police| title=Honours and Recognition Programs > Canadian National Honours| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=20 May 2009[/tpl] and is thus at the apex of the Order of Military Merit as its Sovereign,[tpl]#tag:ref|In royal proclamations issued by the Queen or in her name, the order is thus referred to as "Our Order of Military Merit".[tpl]Cite journal| last=Elizabeth II| authorlink=Elizabeth II| title=Proclamation Summoning Parliament to Meet on May 30, 2011| journal=Canada Gazette| volume=145| issue=1| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| location=Ottawa| date=28 March 2011| url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2011/2011-03-28-x1/html/si-tr34-eng.html| accessdate=14 September 2011[/tpl]|group=n|name=Our[/tpl] followed by the governor general—presently David Johnston—who serves as the fellowship's Chancellor, and the Chief of the Defence Staff—presently Thomas J. Lawson—who is the Principal Commander. Thereafter follow three grades—each having accordant post-nominal letters that are the same in both English and French. Additionally, any governor general, former governor general, or member of the Canadian Royal Family may be appointed as an extraordinary Commander, Officer, or Member.[tpl]Citation| last=Elizabeth II| year=2013| title=The Constitution of the Order of Military Merit| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=15086| accessdate=24 June 2013| ref=harv[/tpl] There are no limits to the population of any grade, and promotions are possible, though this is ordinarily not done within five years of the initial appointment.[tpl]Citation| last=Department of National Defence| author-link=Department of National Defence (Canada)| title=The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces| place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| date=30 January 2004| edition=2| url=http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/lf/Downloads/cfp200.pdf| page=2D-2| id=A-AD-200-000/AG-000| accessdate=4 August 2009| ref=CITEREF_Department_of_National_Defence_2004[/tpl] Any person thus honoured must return their lower grade insignia, as no member may at any time hold more than one appointment in the organization.[tpl]Citation| url=http://www.gg.ca/honours/nat-ord/omm/omm-info_e.asp| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| authorlink=Governor General of Canada| title=Honours > National Orders > Order of Military Merit > Eligibility and Nominations| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=4 August 2009[/tpl] Further, within the order of precedence for Canadian honours, each grade of the Order of Military Merit precedes a similar grade of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces, with Commanders succeeding the Members of the Order of Canada.[tpl]Citation| url=http://www.gg.ca/honours/op/index_e.asp| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| authorlink=Governor General of Canada| title=Honours > Order of Precedence| accessdate=21 December 2008[/tpl]

==Insignia==

Upon admission into the Order of Military Merit, members are presented the appropriate insignia, though these remain property of the Crown.[tpl]Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| date=22 August 2003| publication-date=21 February 2004| contribution=Letters Patent Amending the Constitution of the Order of Military Merit| editor-last=Public Works and Government Services Canada| editor-link=Public Works and Government Services Canada| title=Canada Gazette| page=383| place=Ottawa| publication-place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| id=P.C. 2003-1295| volume=138| issue=8| url=http://gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2004/2004-02-21/pdf/g1-13808.pdf| accessdate=5 August 2009| ref=CITEREF_Elizabeth_II_2003[/tpl] The Sovereign's insignia is a jewelled, 18kt gold crown of rubies, emeralds, and sapphires,[tpl]Citation| url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/queenandcommonwealth/MicroObject.asp?row=14&themeid=453&item=14| last=The Royal Collection| authorlink=Royal Collection| title=e-Gallery > Exhibitions > Queen & Commonwealth > Orders > Canada - Order of Military Merit, Sovereign's Badge| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=4 August 2009[/tpl] from which is suspended a blue enamelled cross pattée with four equal arms and three diamonds between each. At the centre is a disc bearing a maple leaf in pavé-laid rubies on a white enamel background, surrounded at its edge by a red enamel ring (annulus) bearing the words MERIT • MÉRITE • CANADA. The Chancellor wears the badge of a Commander, though is also, upon installation as governor general, granted a livery collar for wear at Order of Military Merit investiture ceremonies;[tpl]Citation| title=Adrienne Clarkson Installed as Governor General| journal=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Autumn 1999| issue=3| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| year=1999| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/1999/installed.htm| accessdate=29 May 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] this is composed of a series of gold medallions, and supports an enamel rendition of the shield of the Royal Arms of Canada, from which the governor general's badge is suspended.
The badges for inductees are of a similar design to the sovereign's badge, though without precious stones, and slight differences for each grade. For Commanders, the emblem is gilt with a red enamel maple leaf in the gold central disk; for Officers, it is gilt with a gold maple leaf; and for Members, both the badge itself and the maple leaf are silver. The reverse bears only a serial number, and all are topped by a St. Edward's Crown,[tpl]Citation| url=http://www.medals.org.uk/canada/canada002.htm| last=Robertson| first=Megan C.| title=C > Canada > Orders, Decorations and Medals of Canada > Order of Military Merit| accessdate=4 August 2009[/tpl] symbolizing that the order is headed by the sovereign. These insignia are worn with the order's ribbon, which is blue with golden edges. Male Commanders wear the badge at the neck while Officers and Members display theirs on the left breast on a medal bar, suspended by, respectively, a bar of gold or silver decorated with a laurel motif. Women wear their emblems on a ribbon bow pinned at the left chest. The ribbon bar, worn for undress, is the same for each grade, save for a miniature blue cross pattée with a maple leaf, the colour of which matches that on the badge of the grade that the wearer was appointed to; someone who has been promoted within the order may wear on their ribbon bar the pins of all grades that they have occupied. These same miniatures also serves as a lapel pin for civilian wear.[tpl]Harvnb| Department of National Defence| 2004| p=2D-1[/tpl]
With the patriation in 1988 of oversight of arms to Canada through the Canadian Heraldic Authority,[tpl]Citation| url=http://www.gg.ca/heraldry/cha/index_e.asp| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| authorlink=Governor General of Canada| title=Heraldry > The Canadian Heraldic Authority > Creation| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=26 July 2009[/tpl] the constitution of the Order of Military Merit was amended to include the entitlement of all inductees to petition the Chief Herald of Canada for personal armorial bearings,[tpl]Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2003| pp=385–386[/tpl] should they not already possess any. Commanders may receive supporters, and all members may have the escutcheon (shield) of their arms encircled with a blue ribbon bearing the order's motto[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]OFFICIUM ANTE COMMODUM[tpl]Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2003| pp=387[/tpl][tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]in gold, and from which is suspended a rendition of the holder's Order of Military Merit badge.

==Eligibility and appointment==

For military ranks of colonel and above, recommendations for appointment to the Order of Military Merit are made by a commanding officer or military advisory committee to the Chief of the Defence Staff, who then forwards the name or names to the governor general; per the Queen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces, neither the nominee, nor any member of his or her family, can be notified or otherwise made aware that they have been suggested for induction into the order.[tpl]Harvnb| Department of National Defence| 2009| p=3[/tpl] Nominations are processed by the Advisory Committee for the Order of Military Merit, which is a part of the Chancellery of Honours at Rideau Hall, and has six members: one appointed by the governor general, four by the Chief of the Defence Staff, and the Chief of the Defence Staff him or herself;[tpl]Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2003| p=384[/tpl] the Secretary to the Governor General serves as the Secretary General of the Order of Military Merit.
Appointments take place annually and are limited to 0.1% of the previous year's total population of the Canadian Forces,[tpl]Harvnb| Department of National Defence| 2004| p=2-2-6[/tpl] including reserves; for example, the 60th list included 111 appointments in 2010. Submissions for appointments must be representative of the whole of the Canadian Forces population and nominators are advised that appointments are not necessarily commensurate with senior rank and long service.  Many outstanding master seaman, petty officers, and lieutenants are as deserving as senior officers and non-commissioned members. The level of Member is generally reserved for non-commissioned members of the forces, petty officers, and commissioned officers up to the rank of army or air force captain or navy lieutenant,[tpl]cite video| people=Department of National Defence| title=Medals in a Minute: the Order of Military Merit| medium=Video| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| location=Ottawa|date=2008| url=http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/lf/English/6_1_1_1.asp?id=3080[/tpl] while no more than six percent of those appointed to the order in total may be inducted as Commanders,[tpl]Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2003| p=385[/tpl] and no more than 30% may be made Officers.[tpl]Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 2003| p=386[/tpl] Appointments are also not made posthumously, though members of foreign armed forces can be admitted as honorary members in any grade. Still, more than 3,000 individuals have been appointed to the Order of Military Merit since its inception, 2,300 into the rank of Member.
