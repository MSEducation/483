[[Primary tumors of the heart]]

CATEGORIES: Heart neoplasia

The primary tumors of the heart are extremely rare tumors that arise from the normal tissues that make up the heart.  This is in contrast to secondary tumors of the heart, which are typically either metastatic from another part of the body, or infiltrate the heart via direct extension from the surrounding tissues.

==Types==

===Benign===

The most common primary tumor of the heart is the myxoma.  In surgical series, the myxoma makes up as much as 77% of all primary tumors of the heart.[tpl]cite journal | author=Molina JE, Edwards JE, Ward HB | title=Primary[/tpl]  Less common tumors of the heart include lipoma and cystic tumor of the atrioventricular nodal region.

===Malignant===

About 20 percent of primary tumors of the heart are malignant in nature.  Malignant tumors of the heart include rhabdomyosarcomas, angiosarcomas, myxosarcomas, fibrosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, reticulum cell sarcomas, desmoplastic small round cell tumor,and liposarcomas.  The cardiac sarcomas may occur at any age, but are more commonly seen in individuals in their 20s to 40s.  They occur equally in males and females.
Malignant Primary heart tumors are the tumors that originate from the heart tissue. Malignant form of cardiac tumors are extremely rare and account for 25% of the diagnosed cases. It is very hard to find information on cardiac sarcomas due to the limited data and the misdiagnosis with the other cardiac diseases. Most malignant heart tumors are sarcomas,which are very difficult to treat, and they have very poor prognostic results. The difficulty lies in  the advanced tumor representation, the advanced stage at representation and due to the insufficient awareness of the disease.[tpl]cite journal|last=Shanmugam|first=G|title=Primary cardiac sarcoma.|journal=European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery|date=2006 Jun|volume=29|issue=6|pages=925–32|pmid=16675225[/tpl] The course of the disease progression and its development is also not very well understood due to the same reasons mentioned earlier. There are many types of cardiac sarcomas. The most common type is Angiosarcoma, which has an incidence of 37% and is represented in male patients more than females. Other types of cardiac sarcomas include  Pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma, Leiomyosarcoma, Synovial sarcoma and intimal sarcoma, which is another type of soft tissue cancer in the blood vessels.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hoffmeierk|first=A|coauthors=Sindermanns, JR; Scheld, HH; Martens, S|title=Cardiac tumors-diagnosis and surgical treatment.|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt international|date=2014 Mar 21|volume=111|issue=12|pages=205–11|pmid=24717305[/tpl] The metastases to the heart from other tissues are up to 100 times more common than the primary heart tumors.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ostrowski|first=S|coauthors=Marcinkiewicz, A; Kośmider, A; Jaszewski, R|title=Sarcomas of the heart as a difficult interdisciplinary problem.|journal=Archives of medical science : AMS|date=2014 Feb 24|volume=10|issue=1|pages=135–48|pmid=24701226[/tpl]

==Mechanism and Causes==

It is very hard to find a common reason for the development of heart sarcoma [tpl]cite journal[/tpl]  Some cytogenetic analysis revealed chromosomal changes and immunohistochemical analysis revealed high expression of p53 gene products, which contribute to the cell's ability to survive through any cellular damage leading to the uncontrolled division of the cell.[tpl]cite web|last=Raaf|first=John H|title=MD, PhD|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/277297-clinical#a0218|publisher=WebMD LLC[/tpl] However, some studies suggest reasons related to previous radiotherapy treatments.[tpl]cite journal|last=Burazor|first=I|coauthors=Imazio, M; Markel, G; Adler, Y|title=Malignant pericardial effusion.|journal=Cardiology|date=2013|volume=124|issue=4|pages=224–32|pmid=23571453[/tpl] Current data are inconclusive regarding the cause of the cardiac tumors but suggest multiple factors that contribute to benign and malignant tumors of the heart. The associated factors include irregularities in the immune system, which compromises the body's ability to fight against any aberrant growths. Other factors include exposure to Radiation, Sun light, viruses and tobacco, which all contribute to the irregular growth of the cells causing tumor formation [tpl]cite web|last=The Johns Hopkins University|first=The Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Johns Hopkins Health System|title=Heart Tumors|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/heart_vascular_institute/conditions_treatments/conditions/heart_tumors.html|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University[/tpl]  The current data suggest that complications of radiotherapy is associated with the development of cardiac tumors, Other data suggest recurrent inflammation that may contribute to most types of Angiosarcoma.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] The malignant tumor may grow at any site in the heart, and the location usually imposes the type of possible treatment. Some of the most common sites for tumor growth is the right atrium, which is the most common site for Angiosarcoma.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] Other locations include the Left Atrium and the bases of the large Aorta and the Pulmonary Artery.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] Spread and Metastasis of the disease is very common. The disease mostly spreads to the lungs. However, it is also possible for the disease to progress to the lymph nodes, bones, liver and the Central Nervous System (CNS).[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] The tumor formation may result in blockade of major blood vessels in the heart, based on its size or it may form an embolism that could travel through the blood to other organs and systems in the body and cause the manifestation of the symptoms.[tpl]cite web|last=Stanford Hospital & Clinics|title=Cardiac Sarcoma|url=http://stanfordhospital.org/healthLib/greystone/heartCenter/heartConditionsinAdults/cardiacSarcoma.html|publisher=Stanford Hospital[/tpl]

==Signs and Symptoms==

The size and the locations of the tumor mostly dictates the types of the symptoms. The manifestations of the cardiac sarcomas mimic the signs and symptoms of the other cardiac diseases. These signs are often mistaken with coronary or vulvar cardiac disease. Most patients represent with symptoms of obstruction to blood flow and interference with valve function.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] 

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of cardiac sarcomas happens usually at late stages of the disease. Much of the available data represent post-mortem analysis of the disease.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] However, it is believed that awareness and extra caution leads to better diagnosis of the disease. Cardiac sarcomas are best diagnosed via performing the necessary echocardiograph, which is proved to be the best tool for early diagnosis.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] Other tests include 3D echo, that is used for surgical procedure planning. Other diagnostic technologies that are used include Angiography, CT and MRI, which are found to differentiate between the benign and the malignant types of cancer.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl][tpl]cite journal[/tpl]

==Treatment and Prognosis==

Due to the rarity and the late stage representation of the disease, the prognosis of cardiac sarcomas are considered to be dismal.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] Data show an overall mean survival rate of 12 months, few patients survived a mean of 27 months without recurrence. Some patients died of recurrent disease or Metastasis with no relevance for age on the onset of the disease.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] So far no valuable treatments have been proven to affect the course of the disease.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] However, the most common approach is a surgical approach.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] Tumor resection and valve replacement are found to be effective in improving the survival rate to few months. However, the tumor usually recur after resection. Autotransplatation of the heart and lungs is another approach. However, still this approach is not widely used due to the high chance of recurrence of the disease.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] The best current approach that is currently used but with limited resources is an adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy after the surgical resection.[tpl]cite journal[/tpl] The last approach is proven to improve the life expectancy of the patient to three years before the occurrence of the disease.

==Recent Research==

There is no record of ongoing research aimed towards prevention of the actual disease, or taking into consideration the course of disease progression, due to the rarity of the disease and to the limited available data. Most of the current research focuses on representation of case studies and aims on increasing the awareness about the primary cardiac tumors. The reason is because part of the major concern and the high mortality of the disease is based on misdiagnosis with other cardiac diseases, which are the results of unawareness. more studies are done to represent different scenarios on actual case studies with emphasis on the diagnostic approaches.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lake|first=A|coauthors=Ashraf, O; Maywald, R; Jalali, H|title=Unique presentation of a primary pleomorphic sarcoma of the left atrium.|journal=Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals|date=2014 Mar 28|pmid=24682338[/tpl][tpl]cite journal[/tpl] A recent study suggested that misdiagnosis of the correct form of the disease is highly suggestive of the delayed treatment and the contribution to overall prognosis of the disease.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gajewski|first=P|coauthors=Błaszak-Ciećwierska, W; Chojnowski, S; Bartczak, A; Różański, J; Dąbrowski, M|title=Angiosarcoma of the heart - a diagnostic pitfall.|journal=Kardiologia polska|date=2013|volume=71|issue=12|pages=1296–8|pmid=24399588[/tpl] Other studies focused mainly on the best approach towards treating the tumor. These studies emphasize on the most efficient ways for surgical and therapeutic interventions. A new research suggested that differentiating between the benign and the malignant forms of cardiac tumors before tumor resection is essential for the treatment and prognosis of the disease.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rahbar|first=K|coauthors=Seifarth, H; Schäfers, M; Stegger, L; Hoffmeier, A; Spieker, T; Tiemann, K; Maintz, D; Scheld, HH; Schober, O; Weckesser, M|title=Differentiation of malignant and benign cardiac tumors using 18F-FDG PET/CT.|journal=Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine|date=2012 Jun|volume=53|issue=6|pages=856–63|pmid=22577239[/tpl] The study also suggested the use of a combined diagnostic imaging technology of 18F-FDG PET/CT, which combines CT and PET scan as one diagnostic tool, suggesting the new technology as favorable diagnostic tool to differentiate between the different forms of the tumor. More studies and case reports are being published to emphasize on the importance of the disease. However, limited or no apparent results are shown to improve the prognosis of the actual disease.[tpl]cite journal|last=Yu|first=L|coauthors=Gu, T; Shi, E; Xiu, Z; Fang, Q; Wang, C; Wang, X; Cheng, Y|title=Primary malignant cardiac tumors.|journal=Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology|date=2014 Mar 27|pmid=24671225[/tpl]

===Valvular===

A subset of the primary tumors of the heart are tumors that are found on the valves of the heart. Tumors that affect the valves of the heart are found in an equal distribution among the four heart valves.  The vast majority of these are papillary fibroelastomas. Primary tumors of the valves of the heart are more likely to occur in males. While most primary tumors of the valves of the heart are not malignant, they are more likely to have symptoms related to the valve, including neurologic symptoms and (in a few cases) sudden cardiac death.

==Prognosis==

The vast majority of the tumors of the heart have a benign course and are not directly fatal. However, even the benign tumors of the heart can be lethal due to either direct extension into the electrical conduction system of the heart (causing complete heart block or a fatal dysrhythmia), or due to emboli from the tumor mass that may have lethal sequelae.
The malignant tumors of the heart have a worse prognosis. Cardiac sarcomas generally lead to death within 2 years of diagnosis, due to rapid infiltration of the myocardium of the heart and obstruction of the normal flow of blood within the heart.[tpl]cite journal | author=Burke AP, Cowan D, Virmani R | title=Primary sarcomas of the heart | journal=Cancer | year=1992 | volume=69 | issue=2 | pages=387–95 | pmid=1728367 | doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19920115)69:23.0.CO;2-N[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Burke AP, Virmani R | title=Osteosarcomas of the heart | journal=Am J Surg Pathol | year=1991 | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=289–95 | pmid=1705103 | doi=10.1097/00000478-199103000-00009[/tpl]
