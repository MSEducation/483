Indiana's Mini 500 began in 1955 as a means to involve women in the Little 500 celebration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/332.html|title=52nd Little 500 at IU Bloomington this weekend|accessdate=2007-06-09[/tpl] The Mini 500 was exclusively for women until 1978. The modern Mini 500 is organized by the Student Foundation Special Events Steering Committee and it is held in Assembly Hall. The race featured men's, women's, and coed divisions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iuinfo.indiana.edu/homepages/0328/text/Little5.htm|title=Little 500 wants YOU|accessdate=2007-06-09[/tpl] Trikes were specially made for the race with larger front wheels and stronger frames.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.collinsites.org/clippings/mini500feature.jpg|title=Trikers gear up for Mini 500|accessdate=2007-06-09[/tpl] Teams were composed of four riders and one optional coach.

==Georgia Tech==

In the 1960s, freshman fraternity pledges were often forced to ride tricycles around campus as a form of punishment or hazing. Georgia Tech's Mini 500 was derived from this practice and was first organized by the Ramblin' Reck Club in 1969 and has been orchestrated during the week leading up to the homecoming football game every year since. The race is divided into men's and women's divisions. Men must complete 15 laps around Peters Parking Deck while women must complete 10.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/homecoming/viewevent.php?id=10|title=Georgia Tech Mini 500|accessdate=2007-06-09[/tpl] In times of poor weather, the race can be shortened. The teams are made up of assorted fraternities, sororities, ROTC, sports clubs, and other student organizations. The teams can have up to seven members (4 drivers and 3 pit crew). As the tricyclers race, they must complete three pit stops in which the front tire is rotated. Each tire rotation and each lap is counted by a designated Ramblin' Reck Club member.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/homecoming/images/events/8.pdf|title=Mini 500 Rules|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-06-09[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The tricycles are provided by Ramblin' Reck Club but because they are made for children, an additional support bar can be welded to the frame. The toy tricycles require unique techniques and strategies for effective riding.
