Until 1926, Loveland City Schools operated as separate Loveland East and Loveland West districts, and each district had its own high school.[tpl]cite web |author=Loveland Area Chamber of Commerce |year=2005 |url=http://lovelandchamber.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=27&Itemid=185 |title=History of the Loveland Area |accessdate=2008-01-29[/tpl] Loveland West High School was located in present-day Loveland's central business district, in the building that now houses Loveland Elementary School. Loveland East High School was built by Cincinnati architect Samuel Hannaford on Broadway Street and has since been converted into a church.
The unified high school, named Loveland Hurst High School, was eventually located on the Hamilton County side of the city. Ann Donahue, a Loveland High School graduate, modeled the set of the television show M.Y.O.B. after this building.[tpl]cite news |first=John|last=Kiesewetter |title=Writer models 'M.Y.O.B.' set after Loveland alma mater |work=The Cincinnati Enquirer |publisher=Gannett Company |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2000/06/04/loc_writer_models_m_y_o.html |date=2000-06-04 |accessdate=2006-10-16[/tpl] It also featured in the made-for-TV movie The Pride of Jesse Hallam.[tpl]cite web|title=Filming locations for The Pride of Jesse Hallam (1981) (TV)|work=Internet Movie Database|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2009-08-24|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082939/locations[/tpl]
Loveland High School's current facilities were built in 1994 to replace aging Hurst High School. Hurst was then converted into a middle school. Two years earlier, Loveland City Schools purchased land in Symmes Township, just outside Loveland city limits. The district signed a contract in which the City agreed to provide the new high school with water and sewage services; in return, the district would push for Hamilton County to annex the high school into Loveland at the city's request.[tpl]cite news |title=Loveland to schools: Annex already |first=Carrie|last=Whitaker |work=The Cincinnati Enquirer |publisher=Gannett Company |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2008-04-23 |url=http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/AB/20080423/NEWS01/304230036/[/tpl] In 2009, the Hamilton County Board of Commissioners allowed Loveland to annex the school after a disagreement with the school board.[tpl]cite news |title=Loveland school board approves annexation petition - reluctantly |first=Jeanne|last=Houck |work=The Loveland Herald |publisher=The Community Press |date=2008-08-20 |accessdate=2008-08-21 |url=http://communitypress.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/C2/20080820/NEWS09/808200350/[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Loveland, school district to finally annex|first=Cindy|last=Kranz|coauthors=Jessica Brown|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|publisher=Gannett Company|date=2009-02-26|accessdate=2009-02-27|url=http://news.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/AB/20090226/NEWS01/302260091/|quote=After 17 years, Loveland High School finally is being annexed to the City of Loveland.
