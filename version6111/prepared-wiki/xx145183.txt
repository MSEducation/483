The TS/S ''Stefan Batory was an ocean liner built in the Netherlands in 1952, as the fourth HA liner to serve under the name of 'SS Maasdam''', initially used to service the Dutch East Indies by the Holland America Line. Originally planned as ordinary freighter under the name of "Diemerdyk".
She was bought from the Netherlands in June 1968 and began service as a Polish ocean liner on 11 April 1969 as a replacement for the then obsolete, but legendary MS Batory, both named after a king of Poland Stefan Batory (1533–1586). 
After she was refitted and renamed at Gdansk, she became the flagship of the Polish Ocean Lines (1969–1988) and mainly sailed from Gdynia–Copenhagen–Rotterdam–London–Montreal–Southampton–Rotterdam–Copenhagen–Gdynia. According to contemporary press infos, on her first arrival in Rotterdam as the "Stefan Batory" in 1969, the former owners of her expressed their interest in buying her back from Polish owners for service under the former flag.
During her long service, the "Stefan Batory" has at least twice appeared in film, significantly remembered, as "part of the set" in "Kochaj albo rzuć" (Love or Leave). The picture team have simply filmed the ship, festively leaving Gdynia, and a part of her original, regular voyage.
She remained in service until 1988 and was the World's last regularly operated transatlantic liner. Festively farewelled by the people, and rather roughly by the Neptune, she was sold to third hands and finally scrapped in Aliağa, Turkey, works commencing in May 2000.http://StefanBatoryOceanLiner.weebly.com
