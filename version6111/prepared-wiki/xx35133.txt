Mars 4 ([tpl]Lang-ru|Марс-4[/tpl]), also known as 3MS No.52S was a Soviet spacecraft intended to explore Mars. A 3MS spacecraft launched as part of the Mars programme, it was intended to enter orbit around Mars in 1974. However, computer problems prevented orbital insertion from occurring.

==Spacecraft==

The Mars 4 spacecraft carried an array of instruments to study Mars. In addition to cameras, it was equipped with a radio telescope, an IR radiometer, multiple photometers, polarimeters, a magnetometer, plasma traps, an electrostatic analyser, a gamma-ray spectrometer, and a radio probe.[tpl]cite book |url=http://history.nasa.gov/monograph24/1973.pdf |last=Siddiqi |first=Asif A. |title=Deep Space Chronicle: A Chronology of Deep Space and Planetary Probes 1958-2000 |series=Monographs in Aerospace History, No. 24 |year=2002 |publisher=NASA History Office |chapter=1973 |pages=101–106[/tpl]
Built by Lavochkin, Mars 4 was the first of two 3MS spacecraft launched to Mars in 1973, being followed by Mars 5. A 3MS was also launched during the 1971 launch window as Kosmos 419. However, due to a launch failure, it failed to depart Earth orbit. In addition to the orbiters, two 3MP lander missions, Mars 6 and Mars 7, were launched during the 1973 window.

==Launch==

Mars 4 was launched by a Proton-K carrier rocket, a Blok D upper stage, flying from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81/23. The launch occurred at 19:30:59 UTC on 21 July 1973, with the first three stages placing the spacecraft and upper stage into a low Earth parking orbit before the Blok D fired to propel Mars 4 into heliocentric orbit bound for Mars.
Shortly after performing a course correction on 30 July 1973, two onboard computers failed, leaving Mars 4 unable to perform manoeuvres. As a result of this, it was unable to enter orbit around Mars. A small amount of data was returned as the probe flew past Mars on 10 February 1974, with a closest approach of [tpl]convert|1844|km[/tpl] at 15:34 UTC.
