Norman Kay (August 11, 1927 – January 17, 2002) was an American bridge player. He partnered Sidney Silodor until Silodor's death in 1963. With Edgar Kaplan, Kay formed one of the most successful and longest-lasting partnerships in organized bridge.[tpl]cite book |last = The Bridge World - Jeff Rubens, Editor |first = |authorlink = |title = Bridge Master: The Best of Edgar Kaplan |edition = |publisher = Bridge World Books|location = New York |page = 9 |series = |year = 2004 |doi = |lccn = |oclc = |isbn = 0-9753419-0-1[/tpl][tpl]cite news | first=Alan| last=Truscott| title=Norman Kay, 74, a Bridge Champion Sans Title|date=2002-01-20 | publisher=The New York Times | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E7D6173BF933A15752C0A9649C8B63 | work =nytimes.com | accessdate =[/tpl] It spanned more than 40 years, and ended with Kaplan's death in 1997.
In 1955, Kay won the American Contract Bridge League's McKenney trophy (now called the Barry Crane Top 500) for most masterpoints won during the tournament year. Kay won 13 major North American Bridge Championships (NABC) in the period of 1957–1977, when he was named ACBL's top performance player. He was runner-up in the Bermuda Bowl twice (1961 and 1967), and was second (1968) and third (1960) in the World Team Olympiad. He was a World Bridge Federation World Life Master and an ACBL Grand Life Master. Kay was arguably the greatest bridge player who never became a world champion. He was known for both the remarkable accuracy of his card play and for his even temperament at the table. Away from the table, he was widely respected as an exceptionally kind and humble gentleman.
Kay was an account executive for Merrill Lynch for 38 years, retiring as a vice president in 1987. He helped his wife who operated a sports memorabilia business from 1980 to 1997. He and his wife, Judy, also owned a stable of standardbreds (trotters and pacers) from 1980 to 1987. Kay died from cancer on January 17, 2002. Judy Kay subsequently married Bobby Wolff in late 2003.[ref]
