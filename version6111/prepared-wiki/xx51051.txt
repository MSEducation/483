[[Kazakhstani tenge]]

CATEGORIES: Economy of Kazakhstan, Currencies of Kazakhstan, 1993 introductions

The tenge ([tpl]lang-kz|теңге, teñge[/tpl]) is the currency of Kazakhstan. It is divided into 100 tïın (тиын, also transliterated as tiyin or tijin). It was introduced on 15 November 1993 to replace the Soviet ruble at a rate of 1 tenge = 500 rubles. The ISO-4217 code is KZT.
The word tenge in the Kazakh and most other Turkic languages means a set of scales (cf the old Uzbek tenga or the Tajik borrowed term tanga). The origin of the word is the Turkic teŋ- which means being equal, balance. The name of this currency is thus similar to the lira, pound and peso. The name of the currency is related to the Russian word for money [tpl]lang-ru|деньги / den'gi[/tpl], which was borrowed from Turkic.

==History==

Kazakhstan was one of the last countries of the CIS to introduce a national currency. In 1991 a "special group" of designers was created: Mendybay Alin, Timur Suleymenov, Asimsaly Duzelkhanov and Khayrulla Gabzhalilov. On November 12, 1993, a decree of the President of Kazakhstan, "About introducing national currency of Republic of Kazakhstan", was issued.  On November 15, 1993, the tenge was brought into circulation. As such, November 15 is celebrated as the "Day of National Currency of Republic of Kazakhstan". In 1995, a tenge printing factory was opened in Kazakhstan. The first consignment of tenge was printed abroad, in the UK. The first coins were minted in Germany.
On March 20, 2007, two days before the Nauryz holiday, the National Bank of Kazakhstan approved a graphical symbol for the Tenge: 8px.  The character was proposed for encoding in Unicode in 2008. In autumn 2006, the National Bank of Kazakhstan organized a competition for the image of the Kazakhstan Tenge and received over 30,000 applications. On March 29, 2007, the National Bank of Kazakhstan announced two designers from Almaty, Vadim Davydenko and Sanzhar Amirkhanov, as winners for the creation of symbol of the  Kazakhstan Tenge. They shared a prize of 1 million tenge and the title of "parents" of the Kazakhstan Tenge symbol.http://www.izvestia.kz/node/9694 It resembles the Japanese postal mark.
On September 2, 2013 the National Bank of Kazakhstan moved the Kazakhstan Tenge from a managed float and pegged it to the U.S. dollar and Russian ruble.Kazakhstan to peg tenge to U.S. dollar, euro, rouble on Sept. 2 http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/28/kazakhstan-currency-idUSL6N0GT1Y020130828
On February 11, 2014, the Kazakh National Bank chose to devalue the tenge by 19% against the U.S. dollar in response to a weakening of the Russian ruble.Kazakhstan devalues tenge by almost 20%, The Financial Times, 11 February 2014

==Coins==

In 1993, the first series of coins were introduced in denominations of 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 tiyin featuring the national arms and were struck in bronze. 1, 3, 5, 10 and 20 tenge were struck in cupro-nickel and depicted stylized and mythical animals. The coins of this period circulated alongside tiyin and low denomination tenge notes of equal value.
In 1995, a new series of coins was introduced, which excluded the tiyin having 1 tenge being the smallest denomination. 50 tenge were later introduced in 1997, followed by 100 tenge in 2002 replacing the equivalent notes. An irregular 2 tenge coin was also introduced later in 2005. Coins currently in circulation are:
Commemorative coins are issued in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 2,500, 5,000 and 10,000 tenge. Silver and gold bullion coins exist in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 tenge. Many of the 20 and 50 tenge commemorative's are also struck in cupro-nickel and occasionally make it out into general circulation as a side coinage with face value.
While older coins were struck in Germany, current coins are struck domestically, by the Kazakhstan Mint in Ust-Kamenogorsk.

==Banknotes==

On 15 November 1993, the National Bank of Kazakhstan issued notes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 tiyn, 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 50 tenge; 100 tenge notes followed shortly thereafter.

Interestingly, the text on the reverse side of 200 tenge banknote is written in Kazakh, although text on the reverse sides of the other banknotes is written in Russian.

===2006 series===

The National Bank of Kazakhstan issued banknotes of new series in 2006. They have the same values as the previously existed ones.
The 2006 series is far more exotic than its predecessors. The obverse is vertical and the denomination is written in Kazakh. All denominations depict the Astana Bayterek monument, the flag of Kazakhstan, the Coat of arms, the handprint with a signature of president Nazarbayev and fragments of the national anthem. The main differences across each denomination are only the colours, the values, the underprint patterns.
On the contrast, the reverses are more differentiated. The value is written in Russian. Each denomination shows a unique building and geography of Kazakhstan in the outline of Kazakhstan border.
The first printing of the 2,000 and 5,000 tenge notes issued in 2006 had misspellings of the word for "bank" (the correct spelling "банкі" was misspelled "банқі"). The misspelling was a politically sensitive issue due to the cultural and political importance of the Kazakh language.Kazakh central bank misspells ‘bank’ on money
