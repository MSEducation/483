==Career==

Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa began his professional Magic: The Gathering career at the 2003 World Championship in Berlin. A 55th place finish put da Rosa at the bottom of the money winning places. A year later, he made his second Pro Tour appearance, again at the World Championship. 
It wasn't until 2005 that he began to attract attention, when he reached the top 8 of Grand Prix Porto Alegre, his hometown. The following season da Rosa had his breakthrough. Alongside teammates Willy Edel and Celso Zampere, he made the finals of Pro Tour Charleston, before losing to Tomohiro Kaji, Tomoharu Saitou, and Shouta Yasooka.[tpl]cite web|title=Kajiharu80 puts the Char in Charleston!| date = 18 June 2006 | accessdate = 2009-10-23|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|url=http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/ptcha06/welcome[/tpl] Just two events later, da Rosa made the top eight again. At Worlds in Paris, he lost in the quarterfinals to the eventual champion, Makihito Mihara, who drew exactly the right card at the last possible moment to win the match. Da Rosa also captained the Brazilian national team to a fourth place finish.[tpl]cite web | title = Mihara, Dutch Crowned World Champions! | date =  3 December 2006 | accessdate = 2009-10-23 | publisher=Wizards of the Coast | url=http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/worlds06/welcome[/tpl] This finish earned him level six, then the highest level in the pro players club, qualified Carlos Rom√£o for all Pro Tour events the following season, and earned invitations to Pro Tour Geneva for the other two members of the team. 
2007 was a slower year for da Rosa. He failed to make the top eight of any Pro Tour, and failed to earn money at a Pro Tour for the first time at Pro Tour Yokohama. In 2008 he returned to the top eight. At Pro Tour Hollywood he reached the quarterfinal, losing to eventual player of the year Shuhei Nakamura.[tpl]cite web|title=Gindy Puts Name in Lights|date= 25 May 2008 |accessdate=2009-10-23|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|url=http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/pthol08/welcome[/tpl] Playing almost the same deck, he repeated this feat at the World Championship in Memphis. Despite being a heavy favourite, he lost his quarterfinal match to American player Jamie Parke.[tpl]cite web|title=Malin, Team USA Crowned Kings of Magic|date=2009-12-14|accessdate=2009-10-23|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|url=http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/worlds08/welcome[/tpl]
2009 started weakly for da Rosa, with day one exits at Pro Tours Kyoto, and Honolulu. However, da Rosa excelled off the Pro Tour, with two Grand Prix top eights and a win at the Brazilian national championship. At Pro Tour Austin, da Rosa made the top eight again, making him the first South American to reach the top eight of five Pro Tours. He made yet another quarterfinal exit, losing to Tsuyoshi Ikeda.[tpl]cite web|title=Kibler Completes Comeback with Austin Victory|date=18 October 2009 | accessdate=2009-10-23 | publisher = Wizards of the Coast | url = http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptaus09/welcome[/tpl] 
In the 2010 season, da Rosa became only the seventh player to reach six Pro Tour top eights when he won Pro Tour San Juan.[tpl]cite web|title=Paulo Prevails in San Juan|date=2010-05-29|accessdate=2010-05-29|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|url=http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptsj10/welcome[/tpl] At the World Championship that year, da Rosa reached his seventh top eight, losing to the eventual champion, Guillaume Matignon, in the semifinals.[tpl]cite web|title=There's No Jace Like Guillaume|date=12 December 2010|accessdate=12 December 2010|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|url=http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/worlds10/welcome[/tpl]
