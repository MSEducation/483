Founded in 1969, John L. Grove formed a partnership with two close friends and bought a small metal fabrication business in McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania. With a crew of 20 workers, they built and sold the first JLG aerial work platform in 1970. Many of the basic design elements of that original lift are still being incorporated into products today.

Paylor was with JLG since 1978 and held roles primarily in the areas of sales, marketing and business development. During his nearly 30 years with JLG, the company grew from a $25 million company to over the $3 billion mark.Rental Management magazine, April 2008 Upon Paylor's retirement in 2010, Wilson Jones took his place.
