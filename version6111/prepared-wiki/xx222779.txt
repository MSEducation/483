The district has two operating school buildings: Tamarac Elementary School (Pre-K through 5) and Tamarac Secondary School (6 through 12). The district is a member of the Rensselaer-Columbia-Greene Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES), known as Questar III.
The district was created upon the centralization (consolidation) of fourteen smaller districts in Brunswick, Pittstown, Grafton, and Poestenkill in 1956 and the high school opened in 1958. The first class graduated in 1960. The district had a combined student body of 1363 during the 2007-2008 school year.[tpl]cite web |title=The New York State District Report Card: Accountability and Overview Report 2007—08 |publisher=State of New York Education Department Office of Information and Reporting Services |year=2009 |url=https://www.nystart.gov/publicweb-rc/2008/82/AOR-2008-490202040000.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2009-06-25[/tpl]

==History==

The district was created upon the centralization (consolidation) of local schools in 1956.[tpl]cite book |last=Zankel |first=Sharon Martin |title=Images of America: Brunswick |publisher=Arcadia Publishing/Brunswick Historical Society |year=1998 |pages=69–80 |isbn=0-7524-1306-6[/tpl]  Previously, Brunswick was serviced by twelve smaller districts, each usually made up of one single-room schoolhouse. Of those previous districts, only two of the original buildings exist in their original state.[tpl]cite web |title=National Register of Historic Places nomination, District 6 Schoolhouse (Javascript) |last=Zankel |first=Sharon |publisher=New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation |url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=102534 |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2009-06-12[/tpl]

===Pre-centralization===

Upon the creation of the government of the Town of Brunswick in April 1807, three commissioners of schools were appointed. Their tasks were to develop schools within the town and offer funding using the Common School Fund, which the New York Legislature had set up in 1805 to help cover the costs of public education. In 1812, the Legislature developed a school district system in which each district was self-governing. These districts were typically small by necessity, so that students could walk or ride to school in a reasonable time period each day.[ref][tpl]cite web |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration nomination, Garfield School (Javascript) |last=Waite |first=Diana S. |publisher=New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation |url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7501 |date=1988-04-29 |accessdate=2009-06-12[/tpl]
[/ref]
At the time, public schools were funded by a combination of population-based state reimbursement, taxes, and tuition paid by parents. In 1867, tuition was abolished, making public education free to all. At that time, attending school was voluntary, but by 1874, it became mandatory for students aged 8 to 14. Enforcement was sometimes difficult though, especially considering the agricultural economy that the area depended upon at the time.
By 1945, ten districts in Brunswick had a student population of 313 between first and ninth grades. Due to the added expenses of small districts (in an era becoming increasingly dominated by the automobile) and sometimes crumbling school facilities, the idea of consolidating smaller districts into one larger district (centralization) became a legitimate issue. By 1953, fourteen districts in Brunswick, Grafton, Pittstown, and Poestenkill were proposed for centralization. Eight of the districts were serviced by one-room schoolhouses with no running water.

===Districts preceding centralization===

At the time just preceding centralization, Brunswick was served by twelve districts.[tpl]cite book |title=Photographic Files Binder Schools I-I. Title Page.

District #1 is located at the corner of Menemsha and Lansing Lanes[tpl]coord|42|42|46.5|N|73|38|20.7|W[/tpl] and was commonly known as the Paul Springer School. The original schoolhouse was built in 1885 but burned down in 1970. The district became known as Brunswick Common School District after the Brunswick Central School District centralization. In the 1960s, students from the elementary school (the only building in the district) voted to name the school George Washington School. The district remained independent until merging into Averill Park Central School District in 1995.[tpl]cite news |last=Picchi |first=Joe |title=District Merger Expected July 1 |pages=B4 |publisher=Times Union (Albany) |url=http://timesunion.com/archives/secure/docheckout.asp?action=Get+Doc+Tag&dblist=TX1995_ALBANYTU&tagnum=190117950056&papid=albanytu&suffixes=false&synonyms=false&thesfile=savesufx.fth&view=rtemplate&templatetype=legacy&query=Brunswick+Common+School+District&outputtype=DOCXSLT |date=1995-01-17 |accessdate=2008-10-01[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
District #2, known as the Garfield School, is located at the corner of Moonlawn Road and New York State Route 2 (Brunswick Road).[tpl]coord|42|43|49.5|N|73|35|51.9|W[/tpl] The school was originally named for President James A. Garfield, who occasionally taught nearby.[tpl]cite web |last=Leith |first=Liz |title=Garfield Library's History |publisher=Brunswick Library |url=http://www.brunswicklibrary.org/history.html |date=c. 1996 |accessdate=2008-12-10 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] It was owned by BCSD until the mid-1980s when it was transferred to the Town of Brunswick. It currently houses the Brunswick Community Library and Brunswick Historical Society and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.[tpl]cite web |title=About Us §Garfield School |publisher=Brunswick Historical Society |url=http://www.bhs-ny.org/about.htm |accessdate=2008-10-23[/tpl]
District #3 was known as the White Church School or the Horace Mann School. Little more information is easily found about the school.
District #4, known as the Pleasant Valley School, Rock Hollow School, or Cropseyville School, was located in the Pleasant Valley sector of Cropseyville on Brunswick Rd. This school was built in 1889 as a replacement for two nearby schools: one near the site of this school, and one on South Road. Today the building is a private residence.
District #5 was originally serviced by the McKinley School, located on New York State Route 7 (Hoosick Road), east of New York State Route 142 (Grange Road), and west of Town Office Road.[tpl]coord|42|45|26|N|73|36|50|W[/tpl] The building was built around 1872 and the building still stands, housing a local business. The replacement schoolhouse, known as the Lee School, was located at Keyes Lane and Merrill Avenue.[tpl]coord|42|45|12|N|73|37|12|W[/tpl] It was constructed in 1953 but soon closed due to centralization. It was then sold to the Brunswick Center Fire Department and used as a banquet hall until it was demolished in 1997 to be replaced by a new town community center.
District #6, most commonly known as the Little Red Schoolhouse, but also sometimes known as the Lincoln School, Brick School, or Rocky Road School, is located at the corner of Buck Road and New York State Route 278 (Brick Church Road).[tpl]coord|42|45|04.25|N|73|34|28.78|W[/tpl] Built around 1830, the building is the oldest standing schoolhouse in Brunswick and is still owned by BCSD. It underwent renovations in the 1970s and received additional refurbishments in the latter half of the 2000s (decade). It was added to National Register of Historic Places in 2008.[tpl]cite web |title=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Priorities: 8/18/08 through 8/22/08 (August 29, 2008) |publisher=National Park Service: National Register of Historic Places |date=2008-07-03 |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20080829.HTM |accessdate=2009-01-20[/tpl]
District #7, known as the VanArnum School, was located on Grange Road north of Calhoun Drive. The school was closed and sold at public auction in 1953. District #7 was centralized into Lansingburgh Central School District.
District #8, located on Hoosick Road across from Mickle Hill Road, was known as the Haynerville School, most likely named for the hamlet. District #9, known as the Moody School, was located on Dater Hill Road. District #10, located on Brunswick Road, east of St. Mary's Cemetery entrance,[tpl]coord|42|43|27|N|73|39|36.5|W[/tpl] was centralized into the Enlarged City School District of Troy. District #11, called the Sycaway School, was located on the corner of Hoosick Street and Lee Avenue. This district was consolidated into the Enlarged City School District of Troy and is the current site of School 18, one of that district's elementary schools. District #12 was known as the Tamarac School, which is the namesake of the current schools on the main campus. It was located on Camel Hill Road, off Tamarac Road. The school was built in 1864, but collapsed under the weight of snow during the winter of 1994-95.

===Centralization===

In January 1945, the Town of Brunswick Trustees created a committee charged with gathering facts about school district centralization and reporting back to the community. In late 1945, the committee proposed a plan to the New York State Education Department, which was approved. Unfortunately the plan was out of the scope of a reasonable budget. By late 1950, town residents began commenting on the inadequacies of the then current infrastructure, equipment, and services within their schools. In early 1952, the district superintendent created a committee made up of one member from each school district to reevaluate centralization. By July 1953, the committee was formed and a chairman elected. That August, committee members met with members of the Education Department to discuss school programs and expected expenditures. It is estimated that an average teacher's salary would be $3,750 in 1956. In March 1954, the Centralization Committee produced a pamphlet entitled Digest of Facts to inform the community of the project. In April 1954, a citizens' advisory committee was created, made up of 48 individuals, representing all districts involved in centralization. By August, the committee produced A Partnership in Education pamphlet to be distributed in the area. On October 8, 1956, the citizens' committee voted to centralize and the first Board of Education was elected.[tpl]cite book |title=Brunswick and School Centralization: Photographic Files Binder Schools II-I |publisher=Brunswick Historical Society[/tpl]

==="Brittonkill"===

While the official name of the district is that of the encompassing town, the name Brittonkill has been in use since 1956.Minutes of Central School District No. 2 of the Towns of Brunswick, Grafton, Pittstown and Poestenkill. January 12, 1956. Brunswick (Brittonkill) Central School District Archives The name is a combination of the names of the four main towns served by the district: Brunswick, Pittstown, Grafton, and Poestenkill. The district held a competition in late 1955 to replace its name "Central School District No. 2 of the Towns of Brunswick, Grafton, Pittstown and Poestenkill". First prize was Brittonkill, submitted by Charles Meeson (also the district treasurer at the time); second prize was "Pittwick", a combination of Brunswick and Pittstown, submitted by Sally Parker; and third prize was "Rock Hollow", the name of a hamlet just east of Cropseyville, submitted (coincidentally) by both Cynthia Pope and Susan Kehn.Minutes of Central School District No. 2 of the Towns of Brunswick, Grafton, Pittstown and Poestenkill. December 8, 1955. Brunswick (Brittonkill) Central School District Archives The Board of Education did not adopt "Brittonkill" on the first attempt, voting four to four on January 12, 1956, and the naming issue was tabled indefinitely on February 9, 1956.Minutes of Central School District No. 2 of the Towns of Brunswick, Grafton, Pittstown and Poestenkill. February 9, 1956. Brunswick (Brittonkill) Central School District Archives
The name can be found in use throughout the district. For example, the school's website uses the name Brittonkill rather than Brunswick , the district seal (see above) uses Brittonkill, and all district buses are labeled "Brittonkill Central Schools". In addition, the Brittonkill Teachers' Association, Brittonkill PTSA, Brittonkill Educational Enrichment Program, and Brittonkill Education Foundation all make use of the name.
Media and official references to the district typically use the name Brunswick[tpl]cite news |title=Rensselaer County School Budget and Board of Education Election Results |url=http://timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=687228 |publisher=Times Union (Albany) |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2008-09-30[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] (as with budget votes and school closings) and sometimes "Brunswick (Brittonkill)", although many times the district is referred to (incorrectly) as Brittonkill Central School District. Sports reports will usually reference the Tamarac Bengals. On rare occasions, the school buildings may incorrectly be referred to as Brittonkill High/Middle/Elementary School.

===Geography===

The district is bordered by Hoosic Valley Central School District and Hoosick Falls Central School District to the north; Berlin Central School District to the east; Averill Park Central School District to the south; and Enlarged City School District of Troy and Lansingburgh Central School District to the west.[tpl]cite web |title=Rensselaer County School Districts (Map) |publisher=Capital District Regional Planning Commission |url=http://www.cdrpc.org/RenCoSch.gif |accessdate=2008-10-04[/tpl]

==Curriculum==

The district follows the general curriculum set forth by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York, under the direction of the Commissioner of Education and the New York State Education Department. To graduate, a student must have at least four credits each of English and social studies; three credits each of math and science; two credits each of gym class and foreign language classes; one credit of fine art; and one-half credit of health class. The student must also have at least 22 credits overall and pass a prescribed amount of state tests to receive a Regents diploma. For all subjects except gym and health, a full-year course is equal to one credit. Each year of gym class is equal to one-half credit and one-half year of health class is equal to the required amount of health credit.

==Infrastructure==

Besides the two school buildings on the main campus, the district also owns another school building, Parker School, in Pittstown.
The campus has one main sports field, complete with bleachers, a reporters' box, concession stand, and newly installed storage building. The track that surrounds the main field underwent a significant upgrade in the late 1990s from a small dirt track to a professional running track. The field is used for both football and soccer. The area is also used for track and field events such as high jump, long jump, and pole vault. Elsewhere on campus there are three soccer fields, one baseball diamond, two softball diamonds, one outdoor basketball court, and two tennis courts.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]

The main campus is serviced by a trickling filter type wastewater treatment plant, which replaced a large septic tank and leach field in the early 2000s (decade).[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]
