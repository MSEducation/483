Imprint was a Canadian television series that aired on TVOntario, BookTelevision, Knowledge and, for one season, on PBS.
Inspired by Bernard Pivot's French literary programme Apostrophes, the series featured interviews with prize-winning authors and journalists, and examined the latest trends in books and contemporary issues in literature. Among the guests featured were Harry Allen, Margaret Atwood, Amiri Baraka, Julian Barnes, Leonard Cohen, David Cronenberg, John Irving, Ray Robertson, Salman Rushdie, and Robert J. Sawyer.
Daniel Richler hosted the series from 1988 until well into the 1990s, and was succeeded by Mary Hynes. The program was last hosted by Tina Srebotnjak.
TVOntario, the program's producer, cancelled the series in early 2005.
