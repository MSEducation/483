[[Hrym]]

CATEGORIES: Jötnar

In Norse mythology, Hrym (Old Norse "decrepit"Orchard (1997:92).) is a jötunn and the captain of the ship Naglfar according to the Gylfaginning (chapter 51). During the end time conflict of Ragnarök he will set sail from Jotunheim, transporting the legions of jötnar toward the battlefield of Vígríðr to confront the gods in the final battle.
Yet in the eddaic poem Völuspá, it is said that it is the god Loki who is captain of Naglfar, but Hrym is still described arriving for Ragnarök in stanza 50 as follows :
