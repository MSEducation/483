[[Vandalic language]]

CATEGORIES: East Germanic languages, Extinct Germanic languages, Medieval languages, Vandals

Vandalic was a Germanic language probably closely related to Gothic. The Vandals,  Hasdingi and Silingi established themselves in Gallaecia (Northern Portugal and Galicia) and in Southern Spain, following other Germanic and non-Germanic peoples (Visigoths, Alans and Suevi), before moving to North Africa in AD 429.

==Evidence==

By the 1st century CE, the writings of Pomponius Mela, Pliny the Elder, and Tacitus  indicate a division of Germanic-speaking peoples into large groupings who shared ancestry and culture. (This division has been appropriated in modern terminology about the divisions of Germanic languages.)

==Surviving Vandalic==

Very little is known about the Vandalic language other than various phrases and a small number of personal names of Vandalic origin, mainly known from documents and personal names in Spanish. The regional name Andalusia is believed to be derived from the Vandals [tpl]Citation needed|reason=not a proven fact|date=June 2012[/tpl], according to the traditional view. When the Moors invaded and occupied Spain from the 8th century to the end of the 15th, the region was called "Al-Andalus". 
The epigram De Conviviis Barbaris in the Latin Anthology, of North African origin and disputed date, contains a fragment in a Germanic language that some authors believe to be Vandalic,http://www.univie.ac.at/indogermanistik/quellentexte.cgi?5Greule, Albrecht and Matthias Springer. Namen des Fr체hmittelalters als sprachliche Zeugnisse und als Geschichtsquellen. P. 49-50. although the fragment itself refers to the language as "Gothic". This may be because both languages were East Germanic and closely related; scholars have pointed out in this contextGreule, Albrecht and Matthias Springer.

P. 48 that Procopius refers to the Goths, Vandals, Visigoths, and Gepids as "Gothic nations" and opines that they "are all of the Arian faith, and have one language called Gothic".Procopius of Caesarea, THE VANDALIC WAR I,2-8 The fragment reads:

==Legacy==

Though the Vandals did not survive as an ethnic group, in the 16th, 18th and 19th century, the Prekmurje Slovenes of Prekmurje, Somogy, and Vas were believed to be the descendants of the Vandals, and their language the Vandalic language. This caused Hungarian, Latin, and other documents to call the Prekmurian language (dialect of the Hungarian Slovenes and the Prekmurje) Vandalic language.Francek Muki훾 - Marija Kozar: Slovensko Porabje, Mohorjeva dru탑ba, Celje 1982. However, Prekmurian is a Slavic language that descended from Slovene, while Vandalic is a completely unrelated  Germanic language.
