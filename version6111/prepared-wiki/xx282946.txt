==All Souls Orchestra==

In 1972 Tredinnick was appointed Organist and Director of Music at the prestigious church of All Souls, Langham Place, in the heart of the West End of London: a post he still holds. He founded the All Souls Orchestra at All Souls, Langham Place, and has conducted the orchestra at a variety of festivals and church services.  Peter Aston, writing in The Musical Times in 1989 commented on the orchestra's presence at the Norwich Festival of Contemporary Church Music.  He describes the festival as being quite conservative in character, however, he notes that the All Souls Orchestra had provided a departure from the more traditionalist fare, adding a more contemporary 'popular' flavour to the festival.  Aston defends the presence of popular music in church music by citing American shaker songs and Wesleyan congregationalist hymns.Peter Aston, 'A Festival of Contemporary Church Music', The Musical Times , 130 (1756), pp. 369+371.
Tredinnick is well known for his expansive, expressive and personal style of directing and coaxing, as well as for his persuasive eye-contact and personable manner. He has conducted the Orchestra alongside several notable singers and songwriters including Sir Cliff Richard, Keith and Kristyn Getty, and Stuart Townend.  The Orchestra performed alongside Richard on a BBC Songs of Praise episode entitled 'The Gospel According to Cliff.'
