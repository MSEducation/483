Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe) is the debut album by the British electronic act Metronomy, originally released in 2006 by Holiphonic Records in the UK.[tpl]cite web|title=Metronomy - Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe)|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/839977|publisher=Discogs.com|accessdate=2007-08-01[/tpl] On first release, 500 copies were produced with the CD in a special cloth case with an illustration by the artist Rose de Borman. It was later released in standard gatefold card format with a plain text cover. In April 2013 a limited edition vinyl with the original embossed fabric casing and artwork was released.
The name of the album comes from a car wrecker who lived in producer Joseph Mount's town of Totnes who was owed money by a man called Pip Paine. The wrecker would leave wrecked cars around Totnes along with the proclamation "Pip Paine, Pay The £5000 You Owe".[tpl]cite web|title=Metronomy - Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe)|url=http://www.trashclub.co.uk/interviews.shtml#met|publisher=trashclub.co.uk|accessdate=2007-08-01[/tpl] A hearse was often seen parked opposite Totnes railway station with this message painted on the side. Joseph describes the album as "the sound of someone living in a musically redundant place trying to make exciting music."http://www.musicomh.com/interviews/metronomy_0908.htm Metronomy Interview
Joe was influenced by a very eclectic group of artists whilst he wrote the album, including Frank Zappa, Aphex Twin, LFO, Talking Heads, Les Rythmes Digitales and Kraftwerk.[tpl]cite web|title=Metronomy - Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe)|url=http://www.planetnotion.com/features/metronomy_interview.html|publisher=planetnotion.com|accessdate=2007-08-01[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
