==Life and career==

Brown, who is of Italian and Filipino descent, grew up in Ottershaw, Surrey with her parents and brother.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] At the age of seven she starred in various adverts and featured on billboards across Australia and the UK for Tango and Ribena. At age twelve, she attended various musical theatre schools including Laine Theatre Arts to pursue a career in musical theatre.
In 2007, Brown auditioned for the fourth series of The X Factor. Although she got through to Bootcamp, she did not make it any further in the competition. However, judge Louis Walsh came up with the idea to bring back former contestants to form two separate bands — boyband Futureproof and girl group Hope.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/xfactor/a76651/louis-suggests-x-factor-experiment.html|title=Louis suggests 'X Factor' experiment|publisher=Digital Spy|date=29 September 2007|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] Brown was made lead singer of the latter by mentor Simon Cowell, with the group making it through to week seven of the live shows, before being eliminated, coming 5th overall. After The X Factor,  Hope was signed by an agent John Giddings, who secured them supporting slots on tour with Westlife, Boyzone, and Shane Ward. Hope began recording their début album. The album, however, was not released, and after two years, Hope disbanded.
Brown, along with members Jess Stickley and Daizy Agnew was scouted by Polydor Records and was asked to be in a new girl group. Girls Can't Catch began work on their début album at the beginning of 2009, completing it on 18 September. Brown, Agnew and Stickley were confirmed as support acts of Girls Aloud's Out of Control Tour beginning in April in Manchester, and ending in June in Newcastle. In September 2009, it was announced that Brown, Agnew and Stickley were to be opening for the Jonas Brothers on the UK run of their world tour. The band disbanded on 13 July 2010.
