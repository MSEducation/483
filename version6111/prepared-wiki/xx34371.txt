Dou Xian ([tpl]zh|c=窦宪[/tpl]; Wade-Giles:Tou Hsien, d. AD 92) was a prominent Chinese general and statesman of the Eastern Han Dynasty. A native of modern-day Xianyang, Shaanxi Province, he was part of the powerful Dou clan which dominated court politics during his tenure. However, his father Dou Xun fell into disgrace and died in 70, leaving Dou Xian an orphan. His fortunes were greatly enhanced, though, when his two sisters entered the imperial harem in 77. In the following year, the older of these two sisters became Empress Zhangde, the wife of Emperor Zhang of Han, and lasted briefly as empress dowager and regent during the early reign of Emperor He of Han.Crespigny, 170.
The biography of Dou Xian can be found in Chapter LIII of the Hou Hanshu.Chavannes (1907), p. 158, n. 3.
