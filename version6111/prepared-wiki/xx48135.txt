==History==

JARING introduced the Internet to the Malaysian community in 1992 when it was commercialized after its first international satellite leased-circuit at 64kps was installed, connecting Kuala Lumpur to Stockton, California.http://www.mimos.my/content/data/231108-the%20wimax%20revolution.pdf Started humbly with only 28 subscribers, it has grown to 0.8 million in 2005 and is expected to grow to more than one million by end of 2007.
In June 1997, JARING became the first Internet Service Provider (ISP) in South East Asia to install the T3 (45Mbit/s) line, which gives JARING subscribers faster access to the Internet. The circuit has then enabled JARING network users to be linked directly with the Internet, including the BITNET and NSFNet.
In 1999, JARING went a step further when an Internet backbone infrastructure which travels at the speed of 2.5 Gigabits per second transmission called SuperJARING was launched, making it the fastest and longest (841Â km) IP-over-fibre backbone service available in the world at that time.
SuperJARING that runs across Peninsular Malaysia including the east coast has the capability to provide next-generation, bandwidth-intensive services like Internet telephony, secure virtual private networks (Secure VPNs), video-on-demand, distance learning and telemedicine.
JARING Communications Sdn Bhd was later established as a spin-off company under MIMOS Berhad on 1 April 2005.
In December 2006, the Ministry of Finance of Malaysia officially took over JARING from MIMOS Berhad.http://www.jaring.my/corporate/
