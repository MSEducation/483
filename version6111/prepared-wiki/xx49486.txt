The host nation won every medal awarded, which was unsurprising as only one foreign entrant competed.  The sport, which had been open to women in its previous incarnation, was again restricted to only male competitors as the number of events shrank from 5 to 2 with the elimination of women's singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles.
