One of the major themes of this album is the response to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. "Heaven Is a Better Place Today" doubles as a tribute to Dan Snyder, a player for the Atlanta Thrashers hockey team who died in an automobile accident nine months before the album's release, and for young men being sent to war.
The Hip performed the song "It Can't be Nashville Every Night" on a season two episode of Canadian situation comedy TV program Corner Gas.
