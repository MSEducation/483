Hungary has an estimated 1,300 thermal springs, a third of which are used at spas across the country. Hungary's thermal waters and spa culture are promoted to tourists. Only France, Japan, Serbia, Iceland, and Italy have similar thermal water capacity. Hungary's thermal baths have been used for 2,000 years for cleansing, relaxation and easing aches and pains. The Romans were the first to use Hungary's thermal waters in the first century, when they built baths on the banks of the Danube River.[tpl]cite news |first=Kristen |last=Schweizer |title=Hungary: 'Mediterran' thermal spa water park |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/traveloutdoors/2001871185_hungarybaths07.html |work=The Seattle Times |date=2004-03-06 |accessdate=2008-05-24 [/tpl] Budapest lies on a geological fault that separates the Buda hills from plains. More than 30,000 cubic metres of warm to scalding (21° to 76°C) mineral water gushes from 118 thermal springs and supply the city's thermal baths. Budapest has been a popular spa destination since Roman times. Some of the baths in the city date from Turkish times while others are modern. They have steam rooms that utilize the healing properties of the springs. Most of the baths offer medical treatments, massages, and pedicures.[tpl]cite book |title=Budapest: Steaming Special Section on Thermal Baths |last=Fallon |first=Steve |year=2003 |publisher=Lonely Planet |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=3wCiLFHUZmYC |isbn=1-86450-356-4 |pages=97 [/tpl] The most famous of Budapest's spas were built at the turn of the 19th century.[tpl]cite news |first=Szonja |last=Krezinger |title=Your tour guide to Budapest |url=http://www.metronews.ca/vancouver/live/article/53424 |work=Metro World News |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2008-05-24 [/tpl]
