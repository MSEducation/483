==Glacial River Warren outlet==

The lowest point between the drainage of Hudson Bay and the Gulf of Mexico is in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and South Dakota.  It lies between Lake Traverse and Big Stone Lake. The divide sits at [tpl]convert|975|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level. When Lake Agassiz existed the valley was the River Warren.  The outflow from the melting glaciers filled Lake Agassiz and then drained through the valley to the Gulf of Mexico. This mass of moving water eroded a valley a [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl] wide and from [tpl]convert|100|ft|m[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|125|ft|m[/tpl] deep.The Glacial Lake Agassiz, Monographs of the United States Geological Survey, Volume XXV; Warren Upham; Government Printing Office, Washington; 1895; Chapter II  Today, this valley is the Red River of the North, which flows northward to Lake Winnipeg, while the southern portion of the valley contains the Minnesota River, which joins the Mississippi River at St. Paul, Minnesota.

==Lockhart Phase: 12,560-12,875 YBP==

thumb|Lockhart Phase of Lake Agassiz, ca 13,000 YBP. Teller and Leverington, 2004 (U.S. Geological Survey)During the Lockhart Phase, water accumulated in the Red River valley of North Dakota and Minnesota. As the water reached to the top of the divide to the south, the water drained into the ancestral Minnesota and Mississippi River system. This occurred while the Laurentian Ice Sheet was at or below the current U.S. and Canadian border.Examining the progression and termination of Lake Agassiz: Michael J. Michalek; 2013  As the ice sheet melted northward, an early Lake Agassiz covered southern Manitoba, the Minnesota and Ontario boundary country, and along the Red River south of Fargo, North Dakota.  The Lockhart phase is associated with the Herman lake stage ([tpl]convert|335|m|ft[/tpl]), the highest shoreline of Lake Agassiz.  The Big Stone Moraine formed the southern boundary of the lake. During the Lockhart Phase the lake is estimated to have been [tpl]convert|231|m|ft[/tpl] deep, with greater depths near the glacier.

==The Moorhead Phase: 12,875-11,690 YBP==

As the ice sheet melted northward, Lake Agassiz found a lower outlet through the Kaministikwia route along the modern Minnesota-Ontario border.  This moved water to Lake Duluth a proglacial lake in the Lake Superior basin.  From there the water drained south via an ancestral  St. Croix and Mississippi River system. The lake drained below the Herman lake beaches until  isostatic rebound and glacial advances closed the Kaministikwia route.  This stabilized the lake at the Norcross lake stage ([tpl]convert|325|m|ft[/tpl]).(Thorleifson, 1996). The average depth of Lake Agassiz during the late Moorhead Phase was [tpl]convert|258|m|ft[/tpl]. Drainage from Lake Agassiz continued to flow southward out of the ancient Minnesota and Mississippi River systems into the Gulf of Mexico.

==Emerson Phase: 11,690-10,630 YBP==

During The Emerson Phase lake levels and drainage patterns continually fluctuated. The lake moved from a southward outlet to a northwestern outlet, and may have been static without a significant outlet during this phase.  Isostatic rebound changed the altitude of the land, and this, combined with changes in the volume of meltwater from the ice margin and the closure of the Kaministikwia outlet in the east increased the size of northern end of the lake.  One hypothesis consist of the lake being a ‘terminal lake’  with water inflows and evapotranspiration being equal. Dating of the glacial moraines shows that the  Clearwater and Athabasca River system and Lake Nipigon and Minong basin were still ice covered. A period of precipitation and meltwater input balance with the rate of evapotranspiration may have existed for a short period of time.  During this phase, the Clearwater and Athabasca River system outlet opened. Isostatic rebound opened the southern outlet for a time, creating the Norcross ([tpl]convert|325|m|ft[/tpl]), Tintah ([tpl]convert|310|m|ft[/tpl])), and Upper Campbell ([tpl]convert|299|m|ft[/tpl]) beaches.  The south outlet was permanently closed at the end of Emerson Phase.

==Nipigon Phase: 10,630-9,160 YBP==

The opening of the Kaministikwia outlet to the east initiated the onset of the Nipigon Phase. The lower lake level ended the southern outlet through the ancestral Minnesota and Mississippi River system.  The ice sheets advance and blocked the northwestern outlet through the Clearwater and Athabasca system. There were several other low level outlets into the Lake Minong basin, including the Kaministikwia and the Lake Nipigon outlet.  These allowed large amounts of water to flow form Lake Agassiz into Lake Minong.  A series of ice advances and retreats between 10,500 and to 9,500 YBP blocked the Lake Nipigon outlet and the other low level outlets, creating periodic catastrophic outbursts of water into the Lake Minong basin. 
These large inflows of water raised Lake Minong lake levels and flowed into Lake Algonquin in the Lake Michigan/Huron basin. These outbursts refilled the Lake Michigan and Huron basins, which are extreme low water levels of the Lake Chippewa (Lake Michigan basin) and Lake Stanley (Lake Huron basin). This was due to isostatic rebound of the northern shorelines combined with the opening of the North Bay outlet of the Lake Huron basin. These repetitive outbursts from Lake Agassiz flooded the Lake Minong basin, then flowed over into the Lake Stanley basin, and then flowed through the North Bay drainage route into the Champlain Sea (present day St. Lawrence lowland). The shifting ice sheet created fluctuating drainage channels into the Lake Nipigon and Superior basin.  A dozen beaches were created during short periods of stability.  Towards the of the Nipising Phase, Lake Agassiz reached its largest geographical size as it joined with Lake Ojibway in the east.

==Ojibway Phase: 9,160- 8,480 YBP==

thumb|Map of Glacial Lake Agassiz and Lake Ojibway ca 7900 YBP.  Designed from Teller and Leverington, 2004 (U.S. Geological Survey)The Ojibway Phase is named for the the glacial lake along the ice front in northern Ontario.  Lake Ojibway merged with Lake Agassiz at this time.  Isostatic rebound glaciated lands south of the ice sheet created a long linear lake from the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border to Quebec. This long lake drained through the easter outlet at Kinojevis, into the Ottawa River valley.  Lake Agassiz-Ojibway drainage raised the sea level. The results can be seen in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and eastern Maine. Marine records from the North Atlantic have identified two separate episodes, linked to northern hemisphere cooling in 8,490 YBP and 8,180–8,340 YBP. These may be linked with the Ojibway Phase of Lake Agassiz and may indicate large amounts of drainage from the Ottawa River valley and the Tyrrell Sea (ancestral Hudson Bay).
The Laurentide Ice Sheet continued to recede.  Continued warming shrank the ice front towards present day Hudson Bay.  Here, the Lake Agassiz northward outlet drained into the Tyrrell Sea. This breach dropped the water level below the eastern Kinojevis outlet. The drainage was followed by the disintegration of the adjacent ice front at about 8,480 YBP. This brought on the end of Lake Agassiz. The ice sheet continued its northward retreat to Baffin Island, leaving the mainland North America around 5,000 YBP.

==Lakes of the Lake Agassiz basin==

Numerous lakes have formed in this glacial lake basin. The best known are the Great Lakes of Manitoba; Lake Winnipeg, Lake Manitoba, and Lake Winnipegosis. A cluster of smaller lakes surround these, including: Cedar Lake, through which the Saskatchewan flows; Lake Dauphin, south of Lake Winnipegosis and tributary to it; and Lake St. Martin, on the Fairford or Little Saskatchewan River, the outlet of Lakes Manitoba and Winnipegosis. In northern Minnesota, there are  Roseau, Thief,  Mud, and Maple lakes, besides three large lakes of that state, Rainy Lake, the Lake of the Woods, and Red Lake.

==Glacial Lakes draining into Lake Agassiz==

Glacial Lake Souris formed along the Manitoba and North Dakota border, forming a crescent around the west side of the Turtle Mountains.  It found an outlet at the ‘’elbow’’ of the modern Souris River.   It was a about [tpl]convert|18|mi|km[/tpl] enter Lake Agassiz’s Assiniboine embayment. At a later period, the southern bay of Lake Souris found a lower outlet into the Pembina River.  Pelican Lake, in the Lang Valley occupies this portion of Lake Souris.
The lower part of the Saskatchewan River basin near its mouth at Cedar Lake was clear of the ice-sheet; before Lake Agassiz began drain to northeast. .   Lake Saskatchewan existed on about [tpl]convert|135|mi|km[/tpl] of the North Saskatchewan River between Saskatoon and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.  A few miles east of Lake Saskatchewan’s outlet, near the modern junction of the north and south branches, it entered Lake Agassiz.  This Saskatchewan embayment extended for [tpl]convert|400|mi|km[/tpl] along the modern Saskatchewan River, route.

==Beaches formed when Lake Agassiz out flowed to the south==

The highest shore of Lake Agassiz is called the Herman Beech. It is named for Herman, Minnesota, in Grant County.  The Herman Beach is the highest shoreline and can be traced from the historic outlet at Lake Traverse on the border of Minnesota and South Dakota.  The beach fluctuates between [tpl]convert|973|ft|m[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|976|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level. The altitude of Lake Traverse at [tpl]convert|971|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level with the gap at Brown’s Valley at [tpl]convert|980|ft|m[/tpl].  This being the historic outlet to Lake Agassiz.The Glacial Lake Agassiz;, Monographs of the United States Geological Survey, Volume XXV; Warren Upham; Government Printing Office, Washington; 1895; Chapter VI[/ref]  
The Heman Beach displays numerous deltas from the major rivers that entered Lake Agassiz at that time.  In Minnesota and North Dakota, these include the Buffalo River Delta; Sand Hill River Delta; Sheyenne River  Delta, Elk Valley Delta, and the Pembin River Delta.  In Manitoba, there are the Assiniboine River Delta, 

==Beaches formed when Lake Agassiz out flowed to the Northeast==

Fourteen shorelines of Lake Agassiz have been identified, which lie below the McCauleyville beaches.  These formed when the River Warren could no longer receive the outflow of the lake. This occurred when a lower outlet was found and the lake shrank with the release of the lakes waters.The Glacial Lake Agassiz;, Monographs of the United States Geological Survey, Volume XXV; Warren Upham; Government Printing Office, Washington; 1895; Chapter VIII The three highest shorelines are named the Blanchard beaches, and the next five in descending order the Hillsboro, the two Emerado, and the two Ojata beaches, from towns on or near their course in North Dakota.

==Remnants and effects==

Lake Winnipeg, Lake Winnipegosis, Lake Manitoba, Red Lake, and Lake of the Woods, among others, are relics of the ancient lake. Other geological and geomorphological evidence for Lake Agassiz can also be seen today. Raised beaches, many kilometers from any water, mark the former boundaries of the lake at various times. While the Red River gradually descends from south to north, these old strandlines ascend as one goes north, due to isostatic rebound since glaciation. Several modern river valleys, including those of the Assiniboine River and the Minnesota River, were originally cut by water entering or leaving the lake. The fertile soils of the Red River Valley, now drained by the Red River of the North, are formed from lacustrine deposits of silt from Lake Agassiz.[tpl]Cite book| last = Sansome| first = Constance Jefferson | title = Minnesota Underfoot: A Field Guide to the State's Outstanding Geologic Features | publisher = Voyageur Press| year = 1983| location = Stillwater, MN | isbn = 0-89658-036-9|pages=174–181[/tpl]
