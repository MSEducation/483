CATEGORIES: Bovines

Taurotragus is a genus of antelopes of the African savanna, which are commonly known as Elands. It contains two species: the Common Eland and the Giant Eland. 
Elands are the largest African antelopes. Males range in size from [tpl]convert|600|to|800|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] and may even reach a ton on rare occasions; females range from [tpl]convert|400|to|600|kg|abbr=on[/tpl].
The meat of the eland contains more protein than cattle meat and less fat, and eland milk has a very high calcium level. For this reason, eland have undergone selection for meat quality and milk quantity in the Askaniya-Nova Zoological Park in Ukraine.  However, domestication of the animal in Europe to take advantage of their nutritional value has thus far been unsuccessful.[tpl]cite book |first=Jared |last=Diamond |title=Guns, Germs and Steel |publisher=W.W.
