Ivar Hippe (born 19 March 1953) is a Norwegian political consultant, former journalist and presenter. He received national media attention in 1982 when he was expelled from Argentina by the government. On his return to Norway he began working for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). In 1999 he became editor-in-chief of the Norwegian financial journal Økonomisk Rapport.
In 2003 he wrote the book Mektig og avmektig: Tore Tønne, media og maktspillet bak kulissene, which followed Tore Tønne's last days before his suicide. The book received good reviews and, after the book's release, Hippe became Gerd-Liv Valla's consultant. He is the older brother of Jon Hippe, the current leader of the Fafo Foundation. Hippe is currently working for the public relations (PR) company Agendum.

Hippe believed the government needed to spend more money from the Norwegian oil fund, saying: "The greatest paradox today is that the government refuses to investigate what it will mean to buy goods and services abroad in fear that someone will come up with the idea of spending more money than we do today. The government plays with the lives of the sick and aggravates children's education because of the dogma that oil money cannot be used".[tpl]Cite news | last = Lorentzen | first = Torgeir | last = Sørum-Johansen | first = Thor | page = 8 | title = Bruk oljepengene, Jens | newspaper = Dagbladet | date = 29 May 2000 | language = Norwegian[/tpl] Hippe left his position as Editor-in-Chief in 2002 because the new owners did not share the same future plans for the magazine as he did.[tpl]cite news | last = Hippe | first = Ivar | page = | title = Takk for meg | newspaper = Dagbladet | date = 29 May 2002 | language = Norwegian[/tpl] He was succeeded by Joachim Bamrud.[tpl]cite news | author = | page = | title = Ny redaktør etter intern strid i Økonomisk Rapport | agency = Norwegian News Agency | date = 12 December 2002 | language = Norwegian[/tpl] Six months after Hippe left a number of journalists and most of the old leadership staff had also left the magazine.[tpl]cite news | last = Eckblad | first = Bjørne | page = 52 | title = Bladeiere med mange jern i ilden | newspaper = Dagens Næringsliv | date = 23 January 2003 | language = Norwegian[/tpl]
