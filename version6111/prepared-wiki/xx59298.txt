The White-cheeked Pintail (Anas bahamensis), also known as the Bahama Pintail or Summer Duck, is a species of dabbling duck.  It was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 under its current scientific name.[tpl]la icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

==Distribution and habitat==

It is found in the Caribbean, South America, and the Galápagos Islands.[tpl]cite book | last =Madge | first =Steve | coauthors= Burn, Hilary|title = Wildfowl: An Identification Guide to the Ducks, Geese and Swans of the World (Helm Identification Guides) | year =  1988| publisher = Christopher Helm|pages =224–225| isbn = 0-7470-2201-1[/tpl]  It occurs on waters with some salinity, such as brackish lakes, estuaries and mangrove swamps.  There are three subspecies:

==Description==

Like many southern ducks, the sexes are similar. It is mainly brown with white cheeks and a red-based grey bill (young birds lack the pink). It cannot be confused with any other duck in its range.

==Behaviour==

The White-cheeked Pintail feeds on aquatic plants and small creatures obtained by dabbling. The nest is on the ground under vegetation and near water.

==Aviculture==

It is popular in wildfowl collections, and escapees are frequently seen in a semi-wild condition in Europe.  A leucistic (whitish) variant is known in aviculture as the Silver Bahama Pintail.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.harteman.nl/omnibus/anseriformes/ducks/bahama-pintail.html |title=Bahama Pintail / White-cheeked Pintail |accessdate=2012-04-29 |work=Harteman Wildfowl  |first=Dan |last=Cowell |publisher=Jan Harteman |date= [/tpl]
