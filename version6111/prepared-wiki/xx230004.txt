Crime/Suspense started operations as Solar USA. In 2005, Jack TV replaced Solar USA and a separate new channel, Crime/Suspense, started test broadcasting on October 15, 2005. On January 1, 2008, the channel became C/S and is now being both on as a cable channel and as a free TV channel through Radio Philippines Network (RPN).
While C/S would retain its official original abbreviation meaning (Crime/Suspense), RPN added a second meaning, Conservation/Survival, as RPN and Solar Entertainment's joint commitment for environment and ecological awareness.
