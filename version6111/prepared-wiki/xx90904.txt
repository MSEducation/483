Marine Drive is a 4.3-kilometre-long boulevard in South Mumbai in the city of Mumbai. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along the coast, which is a natural bay. The road links Nariman Point to Babulnath and Malabar Hill. Marine Drive is situated over reclaimed land facing west-south-west. A promenade lies parallel to this road. In 2012, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai announced that the entire road would be resurfaced, 72 years after it was originally laid.[tpl]cite news |title=Marine Drive will be smoother ride soon |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_marine-drive-will-be-smoother-ride-soon_1754833 |first=Eknath|last=Makne |date=October 22, 2012|agency=Daily News and Analysis|location=Mumbai|accessdate=2012-10-29[/tpl]
The official name for this road, though rarely used, is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road. It was earlier known as Sonapur to local Marathi people.

At the northern end of Marine Drive is Chowpatty Beach. This is a popular beach famed for its Bhel puri (local fast food). Many restaurants also line this stretch of the road. Further down this road lies Walkeshwar, a wealthy neighbourhood of the city, also home to the Governor of Maharashtra.
