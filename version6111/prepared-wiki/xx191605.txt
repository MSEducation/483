Triplemanía, is the biggest annual professional show professional wrestling event promoted by the Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) promotion and is traditionally held in May or June each year, commemorating the anniversary of the foundation of AAA. A majority of the shows have been presented as pay-per-view events, with only a few being shown as Television specials on the Televisa channel. The Triplemanía show features culminations of long building storylines, usually ending at Triplemanía. Some years Triplemanía was not a single show, but a series of shows - either two or three per year, but in recent years it has been a single show. The show has been promoted for 20 years, with 27 shows in total under the Triplemanía banner. The name is a combination of how "AAA" is pronounced in Spanish, "Triple A" and WrestleMania, WWE's biggest annual show. The latest event, Triplemanía XXI, took place on June 16, 2013, at the Mexico City Arena in México City, México.

==Event History==

The first Triplemanía event was held on April 30, 1993 at Plaza de Toros in Mexico City, Mexico. The event drew 48,000 spectators, the largest number for any Triplemanía, indeed the largest number of spectators for any wrestling event in Mexico ever.[tpl]cite web| url = http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingInternational/TripleMania.html | title = TripleManía: Mexico's answer to WrestleManía | accessdate = June 16, 2008 | date = July 5, 2000 | publisher = SLAM!

In 1994, 1995 and 1996 AAA held three Triplemanía events and in 1997 they held two, in subsequent years only one event has been held, the most recent event, Triplemanía XVII, on June 13, 2009. Three cities are tied for most events hosted, Mexico City, Naucalpan and Madero have all hosted four events. Twice Triplemanía has been held outside of Mexico, Triplemanía IV-A was held in Chicago, Illinois in the United States and Triplemanía VIII was held in Tokyo, Japan. The lowest recorded attendance was 1.700 for Triplemanía VIII.
As is tradition with recent major AAA shows the wrestlers compete inside a hexagonal wrestling ring and not the four sided ring the promotion uses for television events and House shows. As of 2013 Triplemanía has seen 27 Lucha de Apuestas, or bet fights. 14 times a wrestler has been unmasked and 13 times a wrestler or wrestlers have hair their hair shaved off as a result of losing the Apusta match. Triplemanía has seen the unmasking of Máscara Año 2000, Black Cat, Ángel Mortal, Payasito Rojo, Marabunta, Winners, Halcon Dorado, Jr., La Calaca, Máscara Maligna, Maníaco, Cibernético, Muerte Cibernetica, Super Caló and Máscara Año 2000, Jr. The event has hosted 23 championship matches, with 17 championships changing hands on the show.
