[[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]

CATEGORIES: Isaac Newton, Alchemical documents, Alchemy, Hermeticism, Occult

Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727), the noted English scientist and mathematician, wrote many works that would now be classified as occult studies. These occult works explored chronology, alchemy, and Biblical interpretation (especially of the Apocalypse). Newton's scientific work may have been of lesser personal importance to him, as he placed emphasis on rediscovering the occult wisdom of the ancients. In this sense, someKeynes, J.M., "Newton, The Man"; Proceedings of the Royal Society Newton Tercentenary Celebrations, 15–19 July 1946; Cambridge University Press (1947) believe that any reference to a "Newtonian Worldview" as being purely mechanical in nature is somewhat inaccurate.
After purchasing and studying Newton's alchemical works in 1942, economist John Maynard Keynes, for example, opined that "Newton was not the first of the age of reason, he was the last of the magicians". In the Early Modern Period of Newton's lifetime, the educated embraced a world view different from that of later centuries. Distinctions between science, superstition, and pseudoscience were still being formulated, and a devoutly Christian Biblical perspective permeated Western culture.

==Alchemical research==

Much of what are known as Isaac Newton's occult studies can largely be attributed to his study of alchemy."Newton’s manuscripts provide evidence that he gave considerable thought to alchemy as emblematic of a purely scientific explanation of nature and was in fact deeply involved in conceiving alchemy as spiritual." F. Calian, "Some Modern Controversies on the Historiography of Alchemy" in Annual of Medieval Studies at CEU (2010), 186. Newton was deeply interested in all forms of natural sciences and materials science, an interest which would ultimately lead to some of his better-known contributions to science. During Newton's lifetime the study of chemistry was still in its infancy, so many of his experimental studies used esoteric language and vague terminology more typically associated with alchemy and occultism."his alchemy cannot be seen solely in connection with his chemical experiments but was also a link between his religious beliefs and his scientific aims”. Karin Figala, “Newton’s Alchemy,” in The Cambridge Companion to Newton, ed. I. Bernard  Cohen  and  George  Edwin  Smith  (Cambridge:  Cambridge  University  Press, 2004), 375. It was not until several decades after Newton's death that experiments of stoichiometry under the pioneering works of Antoine Lavoisier were conducted, and analytical chemistry, with its associated nomenclature, came to resemble modern chemistry as we know it today. However, Newton's contemporary and fellow Royal Society member, Robert Boyle, had already discovered the basic concepts of modern chemistry and began establishing modern norms of experimental practice and communication in chemistry, information which Newton did not utilize.
Much of Newton's writing on alchemy may have been lost in a fire in his laboratory, so the true extent of his work in this area may have been larger than is currently known. Newton also suffered a nervous breakdown during his period of alchemical work, which is thought by some to have resulted from the psychological transformation alchemy was originally designed to induce [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl], though there is also speculation that it may have been some form of chemical poisoning (possibly from mercury, lead, or some other substance).
Newton's writings suggest that one of the main goals of his alchemy may have been the discovery of The Philosopher's Stone (a material believed to turn base metals into gold), and perhaps to a lesser extent, the discovery of the highly coveted Elixir of Life.[tpl]cite video | people = Nova: Newton's Dark Secrets | title = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/newton/ | publisher = PBS | location = USA | date = 2005 [/tpl] Newton reportedly believed that a Diana's Tree, an alchemical demonstration producing a dendritic "growth" of silver from solution, was evidence that metals "possessed a sort of life.""Isaac Newton and the Philosophers' Stone", Jane Bosveld, Discover Magazine, July/August, 2010
Some practices of alchemy were banned in England during Newton's lifetime, due in part to unscrupulous practitioners who would often promise wealthy benefactors unrealistic results in an attempt to swindle them. The English Crown, also fearing the potential devaluation of gold, should The Philosopher's Stone actually be discovered, made penalties for alchemy very severe. In some cases the punishment for unsanctioned alchemy would include the public hanging of an offender on a gilded scaffold while adorned with tinsel and other unspecified items.

==Writings==

Due to the threat of punishment and the potential scrutiny  he feared from his peers within the scientific community, Newton may have deliberately left his work on alchemical subjects unpublished. Newton was well known as being highly sensitive to criticism, such as the numerous instances when he was criticized by Robert Hooke, and his admitted reluctance to publish any substantial information regarding calculus before 1693. A perfectionist by nature, Newton also refrained from publication of material that he felt was incomplete, as evident from a 38-year gap from Newton's conception of calculus in 1666 and its final full publication in 1704, which would ultimately lead to the infamous Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy.
In 1936, a collection of Isaac Newton's unpublished works were auctioned by Sotheby's on behalf of Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth, who had inherited them from Newton's great-niece.  Known as the "Portsmouth Papers", this material consisted of three hundred and twenty-nine lots of Newton's manuscripts, over a third of which were filled with content that appeared to be alchemical in nature. At the time of Newton's death this material was considered "unfit to publish" by Newton's estate, and consequently fell into obscurity until their somewhat sensational reemergence in 1936.[ref]

At the auction many of these documents were purchased by economist John Maynard Keynes, who throughout his life collected many of Newton's alchemical writings. Much of the Keynes collection later passed to eccentric document collector Abraham Yahuda, who was himself a vigorous collector of Isaac Newton's original manuscripts.
Many of the documents collected by Keynes and Yahuda are now in the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem. In recent years, several projects have begun to gather, catalogue, and transcribe the fragmented collection of Newton's work on alchemical subjects and make them freely available for on-line access. Two of these are The Chymistry of Isaac Newton ProjectWilliam R. Newman, History of Science Professor, Indiana University index  supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, and The Newton Project[http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/prism.php?id=1 prism.php(1) supported by the U.K. Arts and Humanities Research Board. In addition, The Jewish National and University Library has published a number of high-quality scanned images of various Newton documents.gallery

===The Philosopher's Stone===

Of the material sold during the 1936 Sotheby's auction, several documents indicate an interest by Newton in the procurement or development of the Philosopher's Stone. Most notably are documents entitled Artephius his secret Book, followed by The Epistle of Iohn Pontanus, wherein he beareth witness of ye book of Artephius; these are themselves a collection of excerpts from another work entitled Nicholas Flammel, His Exposition of the Hieroglyphicall Figures which he caused to be painted upon an Arch in St Innocents Church-yard in Paris. Together with The secret Booke of Artephius, And the Epistle of Iohn Pontanus: Containing both the Theoricke and the Practicke of the Philosophers Stone.  This work may also have been referenced by Newton in its Latin version found within Lazarus Zetzner's Theatrum Chemicum, a volume often associated with the Turba Philosophorum and other early European alchemical manuscripts.  Nicolas Flamel, one subject of the aforementioned work, was a notable, though mysterious figure, often associated with the discovery of the Philosopher's Stone, hieroglyphical figures, early forms of tarot, and occultism.  Artephius, and his "secret book", were also subjects of interest to 17th century alchemists.
Also in the 1936 auction of Newton's collection was, The Epitome of the treasure of health written by Edwardus Generosus Anglicus innominatus who lived Anno Domini 1562.  This is a twenty-eight page treatise on the Philosopher's Stone, the Animal or Angelicall Stone, the Prospective stone or magical stone of Moses, and the vegetable or the growing stone.  The treatise concludes with an alchemical poem.

==Biblical studies==

In a manuscript he wrote in 1704 in which he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible, Newton estimated that the world would end no earlier than 2060. In predicting this he said, "This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail."

===Newton's studies of the Temple of Solomon===

Newton studied and wrote extensively upon the Temple of Solomon, dedicating an entire chapter of The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms to his observations regarding the temple.  Newton's primary source for information was the description of the structure given within 1 Kings of the Hebrew Bible, which he translated himself from Hebrew.[tpl]cite web | last =Richman  | first =Rabbi Chaim | coauthors =Temple Institute | title =Temple Institute: Isaac Newton and the Holy Temple | publisher =Temple Institute | date =1991–2008 | url =http://www.templeinstitute.org/isaac_newton_holy_temple.htm | accessdate =1 July 2008 [/tpl]
In addition to scripture, Newton also relied upon various ancient and contemporary sources while studying the temple.  He believed that many ancient sources were endowed with sacred wisdom and that the proportions of many of their temples were in themselves sacred.  This belief would lead Newton to examine many architectural works of Hellenistic Greece, as well as Roman sources such as Vitruvius, in a search for their occult knowledge.  This concept, often termed prisca sapientia (sacred wisdom and also the ancient wisdom that was revealed to Adam and Moses directly by God), was a common belief of many scholars during Newton's lifetime.[tpl]Cite book | last =Christianson | first =Gale E. | publication-date =2005 | title =Isaac Newton | publisher =Oxford University Press US | page =144  | isbn =0-19-530070-X | url =http://books.google.com/?id=lwcDZ0Ex4lYC | accessdate = 4 July 2008 | year =2005 | postscript = [/tpl]
A more contemporary source for Newton's studies of the temple was Juan Bautista Villalpando, who just a few decades earlier had published an influential manuscript entitled Ezechielem Explanationes, in which Villalpando comments on the visions of the biblical prophet Ezekiel, including within this work his own interpretations and elaborate reconstructions of Solomon's Temple.  In its time, Villalpando's work on the temple produced a great deal of interest throughout Europe and had a significant impact upon later architects and scholars.Goldish.

Newton believed that the temple was designed by King Solomon with privileged eyes and divine guidance.  To Newton, the geometry of the temple represented more than a mathematical blueprint, it also provided a time-frame chronology of Hebrew history.[tpl]Cite book | last =Gardner | first =Laurence | publication-date =2007 | year = 2007| title =The Shadow of Solomon: The Lost Secret of the Freemasons Revealed | publication-place =Originally published: London : HarperElement, 2005 | place =USA | publisher =Weiser | page =146 | isbn =1-57863-404-0 | url =http://books.google.com/?id=JTPcRXdUahQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Shadow+of+Solomon | accessdate =4 July 2008 | postscript = [/tpl]  It was for this reason that he included a chapter devoted to the temple within The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms, a section which initially may seem unrelated to the historical nature of the book as a whole.
Newton felt that just as the writings of ancient philosophers, scholars, and Biblical figures contained within them unknown sacred wisdom, the same was true of their architecture.  He believed that these men had hidden their knowledge in a complex code of symbolic and mathematical language that, when deciphered, would reveal an unknown knowledge of how nature works.
In 1675 Newton annotated a copy of Manna - a disquisition of the nature of alchemy, an anonymous treatise which had been given to him by his fellow scholar Ezekiel Foxcroft.  In his annotation Newton reflected upon his reasons for examining Solomon's Temple by writing:
During Newton's lifetime, there was great interest in the Temple of Solomon in Europe, due to the success of Villalpando's publications,  and augmented by a vogue for detailed engravings and physical models presented in various galleries for public viewing.  In 1628, Judah Leon Templo  produced a model of the temple and surrounding Jerusalem, which was popular in its day. Around 1692, Gerhard Schott produced a highly detailed model of the temple for use in an opera in Hamburg composed by Christian Heinrich Postel.  This immense [tpl]convert|13|ft|m|adj=mid|-high[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|80|ft|m|adj=mid|-around[/tpl] model was later sold in 1725 and was exhibited in London as early as 1723, and then later temporarily installed at the London Royal Exchange from 1729–1730, where it could be viewed for half-a-crown.  Sir Isaac Newton's most comprehensive work on the temple, found within The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms, was published posthumously in 1728, only adding to the public interest in the temple.[tpl]cite web | last =Crawley | first =W.

===Newton's prophecy===

Newton considered himself to be one of a select group of individuals who were specially chosen by God for the task of understanding Biblical scripture.[ref]
