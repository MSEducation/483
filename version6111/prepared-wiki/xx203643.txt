WTRF-DT2 is the primary Fox and secondary MyNetworkTV-affiliated television station for the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia and the Allegheny Plateau of Eastern Ohio. It is a second digital subchannel of CBS affiliate WTRF-TV which is owned by West Virginia Media Holdings. Over-the-air, the station broadcasts a digital signal on VHF channel 7.2 from a transmitter in Bridgeport, Ohio. Known on-air as Fox Ohio Valley, this can also be seen on Comcast channel 12. WTRF-DT2's parent station has studios on 16th Street in Downtown Wheeling. Syndicated programming on the channel includes: Everybody Loves Raymond, Two and a Half Men, Family Guy, and Maury. Programming from MyNetworkTV airs weeknights from 11 to 1 in the morning. 
Launched in 2007, WTRF-DT2 is the second newest channel in the Wheeling/Steubenville area behind WTRF-DT3. Previously, WPGH-TV out of nearby Pittsburgh served the market as the de facto affiliate. However, it is still widely available over-the-air and on cable in the area. As a result of Fox and MyNetworkTV airing on WTRF-DT2 and the recent launch of ABC on WTRF's third digital subchannel, the tiny Wheeling/Steubenville market no longer lacks any major affiliate.
