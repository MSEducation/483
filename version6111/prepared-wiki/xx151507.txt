==Eruption information==

This Holocene volcano erupted in the year 2220 Â± 300 years B.C. When Dotsero blew, it created small scoria cones that were constructed along a NNE-SSW line on either side of the maar. The eruption date is based upon radiocarbon dating of wood found underneath some of the scoria.[tpl]cite book | last = Wood  | first = Charles A. | coauthors = Jurgen Kienle | title = Volcanos of North America: United States and Canada | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1990 | location = | pages = | isbn = [/tpl] It is one of the youngest eruptions in the continental U.S. and it produced an explosion crater, a lahar, and a [tpl]convert|3|km|mi|1|sp=us|adj=on[/tpl] long lava flow.
Volcanoes that have erupted in the past 10,000 years are more likely to become active again.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.postindependent.com/article/20050511/VALLEYNEWS/105110016 |title=Donna Gray |publisher=Glenwood Spring Post Independent |date=11 May 2005 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5sXfRJdKp |archivedate=2010-09-06[/tpl]
