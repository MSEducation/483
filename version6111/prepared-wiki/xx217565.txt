[[Intellectual property education]]

CATEGORIES: Intellectual property law

Intellectual property education is the teaching of explanations of and arguments concerning intellectual property laws, especially copyright and related violations. Proponents[tpl]Who|date=June 2009[/tpl] argue that such education should be implemented because of increasing copyright infringement by students (and the general population). Detractors[tpl]Who|date=June 2009[/tpl] argue that such education is tantamount to forced indoctrination of propaganda.
