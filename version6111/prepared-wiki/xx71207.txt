==Early settlements==

Settlement in Karnataka is found to be existent at least from the 2nd millennium BC as explored in Brahmagiri archaeological site near Chitradurga district, central Karnataka. Chandravalli exploration has revealed interaction of Roman and Chinese travelers around the 2nd and 3rd century BC.Chandravalli
Kannadigas have built powerful empires and kingdoms with Kannada as the official language.Amaresh Dutta, pp141-142 The language was once popular from Kaveri to Godavari as mentioned in the Kannada classic Kavirajamarga of 850 CE.Sastri (1955), pp355-356 Archaeological evidences prove Kannada inscriptions found as far north as Madhya Pradesh (Inscription of Krishna III) and Bihar.Thapar (2003), p 433 The great Karnataka Expansion provides insights to kingdoms of northern India whose originators were from Kannada country.Kamath (2001), pp 84, 90

===Music===

Dasa Sahitya is the literature of Bhakti movement composed by devotees in honor of Lord Vishnu or one of his avatars. Dasa is literally "servant" in Kannada and sahitya is literature. Haridasas ("servants of God") were preachers of Bhakti to Vishnu. The bhakti literature of these Haridasas is collectively referred to as Dasa Sahitya. It is composed in the Kannada language.Haridasa Contribution to Kannada Literature

===Theater===

Rangabhoomi or the theater culture is a tradition with Kannadigas. While a lot of gadhya (literature) is written in praise of the heroic characters of the epics and puranas, there are major works depicting the kings and their rule. These are called Naataka (plays having wide ranging stages for performance like Rangamancha staged in either theaters or on streets) and Bayalata (ಬಯಲಾಟ).[tpl]Cite book|author= Manohar Laxman Varadpande|title=History of Indian theatre, Volume 2 |page=311|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6ZrjC24PuDQC&lpg=RA2-PA311&ots=nRnHXNhi4h&dq=Bayalata%2C%20Indian%20open%20air%20theatre&pg=RA2-PA311#v=onepage&q=Bayalata,%20Indian%20open%20air%20theatre&f=false |publisher= Abhinav Publications|year= 1992|isbn=81-7017-278-0 |isbn=9788170172789[/tpl] As its etymology indicates, bayalu means open-air field and ata means theater.

==Cuisine==

The cuisine of Karnataka includes many vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The varieties reflect influences from the food habits of many regions and communities from the three neighbouring South Indian states, as well as the state of Maharashtra to its north.
Some typical everyday dishes in Kannadiga homes include Bisi Bele Bath, Jolada Rotti, Ragi Rotti, Akki Rotti, Saaru, Huli, Davanagere Benne Dosa, Ragi mudde, Chitranna (lemon rice) and Uppittu. The famous masala dosa traces its origin to Udupi cuisine.[tpl]cite web|title=India's new offering to curry Western flavor |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/FA24Df05.html |author=Raja M - 'The dosa, like most other south Indian culinary exports, is often linked to Udupi, a small temple town in the state of Karnataka'|publisher=Asia Times, June 24, 2004 |work=|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl] Plain and rave Idli, Mysore Masala Dosa and Maddur Vade are very popular in South Karnataka.

Indis (chutneys) of Karnataka have a very distinct taste and flavour. Some popular ones include Shenga indi (groundnut), Agashi indi, Karal indi, Inichi indi and Mavina indi (mango). Similarly, Karnataka uppinakai (pickles) too are very distinct from the rest like Mavina thokku (fine mango pickles), Nimbekai uppinakai (lemon pickles), Tenga Mavina uppinakai (entire mango pickle), gaajri uppinkai (carrot pickle) and menshinikai uppinakai (chili pickle).

==Costumes==

The costume of Kannada people varies from place to place. The Kannadiga male costumes of South Karntaka mainly include Panchey (often tied as Kachche) or Lungi (wrapping style depends on the region) and a shirt. During the era of Kingdoms, the crowns available mainly were Mysuru Peta and Dharwad Peta. Shalya is a piece of long cloth which is put on shoulder commonly seen in countryside. Many use Khadi in their clothing till date of which politicians are prominent ones.
Karnataka has the only village in the country which produces authentic Indian national flags according to manufacturing process and specifications for the flag are laid out by the Bureau of Indian Standards at Hubli.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.khadifederation.com/ |title=Karnataka Khadi Gramodyog Samyukta Sangh (Federation), Hubli |publisher=Khadifederation.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl]

Jeans are popular among the youth, while new age Khadi/silk printed with art or emblem also find place. Kasuti is a form of embroidery work which is very popularly sought-after art on dress and costumes.

==Literature==

Kannada literature is filled with literary figures and pioneers all through. With an unbroken literary history of over a thousand years,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/195008/living-bard.html |title=The living bard |publisher=Deccan Herald |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl] the excellence of Kannada literature continues into the present day: works of Kannada literature have received eight Jnanpith awards[tpl]cite web|author=Posted by: Prasad |url=http://thatskannada.oneindia.in/news/2011/09/19/jnanapeetha-award-to-chandrashekhar-kambar-aid0038.html |title=ಡಾ. ಚಂದ್ರಶೇಖರ ಕಂಬಾರರಿಗೆ ಜ್ಞಾನಪೀಠ ಪ್ರಶಸ್ತಿ |publisher=Thatskannada.oneindia.in |date=2011-09-19 |accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl] and fifty-six Sahitya Akademi awards.
Pampa, Ranna and Ponna are considered as three jewels of Old Kannada (Halegannada). Janna was another notable poet of this genre.
Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi, Allama Prabhu, Madhvacharya, Vidyaranya, Harihara, Raghavanka, Kumara Vyasa, Sarvajna, Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasa, Shishunala Shareefa, Raghavendra Swami etc. were pioneers of Nadugannada. All these have been inviolved with social and cultural movements and hence this was the golden era of literature which brought about a renaissance in Kannada literature. They all had a characteristic naamankita (insignia) which would denote a power equaling a God in popular comparison. The literature saw the Vachana (said), Tattva (that-ness), Sharana (saviour God), and Dasa (slave God) padas (short poetries) reach the common man's ignorance into great depths leading to Siddhanta (philosophies).

Karnataka is one of the few states which, while a leading contributor for GDP of the country[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kar.nic.in/finance/bud2007/bsp07.htm |title=GDP contribution |publisher=Kar.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl] and home for industries, has preserved its forests and wildlife. The evergreen Sahyadri and Western Ghats are home to protected Wildlife of Karnataka. The Kannadiga culture protects and balances Kaadu and Naadu as can be seen. Although seen scantly still the state enjoys the diversity owing to tribal sects of Soliga, Badaga, Jenu Kuruba, Hakki Pikki, Lambani and other inhabitants of forests. See Appiko Chaluvali.

===Purana===

The Puranas describe the region as Kishkindha in the ages of Ramayana. There are also literary evidences for the region of Mysore called as Mahisha Mandala after a demon named Mahishasura. Parashurama and Hanumantha are some epic characters to be cited relating to place.

===Punya Koti===

One of the most prominently popular and acknowledged Jaanapada song is "Dharani mandala madhyadolage" which narrates an incidence between mother cow and an aggressive tiger in a country called Karnata

===Vishwa Maanava===

Karnataka as now can be viewed as a multicultural state — almost all the religions that can be found in India can be found here and there has been lot emigration as well due to which multi-ethnic diaspora can be seen. As the kingdoms provided a safe centres for development of all cultures we can see a huge diversities from region to region. Even the language and dialects varies from place to place. The language has evolved distinctly in both the backyard (folk/basic/prakrutha) and frontyard (refined and related to Samskrutha/Sankrit) of the culture.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] It can be said that the major works of Sanskrit have originated and continues to evolve here.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] Shringeri, Udupi are some of nerve centres. One of the leading examples include a village near Shivamogga where people speak only Sanskrit till date. Bengaluru has almost all language speakers of India.
One of the most acknowledged concept is to be a Vishwa Maanava or universal being. In Kuvempu's ideology this has a renowned explanation "Every Child is born as a Vishwa Maanava or a Universal Human. It is we who make him Alpa Maanava or Little Human by putting various constrictions of borders rituals and castes. It hence becomes responsibility of our culture to again make him a Universal Being unbound and free." The Kannadiga culture is known to provide shelter and self-respect to people by owning them and their culture.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] Two colonies for refugees from Tibet are formed, one near Mundgod and one near Kushalanagara, protecting them from Chinese atrocities. Karnataka has sheltered flood victims of northeastern India like Assam and provided them jobs. One of the easily seen diversity is the surnames which vary from hugely like some may involve names involving a Hindu and Muslim name or having a Hindu Christian name (more found in Mangalore) or even a Muslim Christian name. Hindu is normally considered a misnomer for Sanathana.
Karnataka and parts of Maharashtra are the only states which have diversity of including Malenadu Nithyaharidwarna — evergreen ghats and Bayaluseeme which have different ways of living in the same state.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] Not only this but it acts as a gateway to North and South Indian cultures. It may come as a surprise that Karnataka is next only to Rajasthan in India when it comes to area under arid land but still Southern Karnataka is referred to as Gandhada Gudi — temple of sandalwood found in its protected forests.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]

===Political sphere===

After the Odeyar era who already had established democracy by naming elected representative called Saamantha in southern regions as early as 19th century, the 1947 partition brought a centre into being under democracy and Karnataka accepted a bicameral legislature. But this was a functionally a failure as there always has been a tug of war from centre and states to an extent that from the 1990s to 2010 there have always been different political parties operating at centre and state. North Karnataka had other problems of getting independence more from Nizams. So there were two spheres. Lack of will and coordination and constant fights have been hallmark of politics which has prevented a regional party/media from arising in the land. Kerala being a neighbour where hugely successful communist ideology in bringing up literacy levels has a backing here and a few naxalite outfits function in Karnataka.
Functional failure of all pillars of democracy even being upper riparian state can be clearly seen in the Kaveri River Water Dispute issue. The failure extended to bureaucracy and Karnataka reached the position of being fourth most corrupt state of India[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/may/29kgovt1.htm |title=Bureaucratic Corruption |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl] due to political and bureaucratic lobby. Because of this, Lokayukta (see N. Venkatachala) was formed but could not get the required powers to deal with the powerful. In the field of press and journalism P. Lankesh and S. GurumurthyS Gurumurthy of The New Indian Express[tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl] are some of the noted ones famous for their leftist affiliations.

===Horanadu Kannadiga===

Horanadu Kannadigas (or non-resident Kannadigas) are Kannadigas who have migrated to another state or country, people of Kannada origin born outside Karnataka, or people of Kannada origin who reside permanently outside of Karnataka.

==Kannada Kannadiga Karnataka==

During the period of British rule, state of Karnataka as it stands today did not exist. Areas that today comprise Karnataka were under as many as 20 different administrative units with the princely state of Mysore, Nizam's Hyderabad, the Bombay Presidency, the Madras Presidency and the territory of Kodagu being the most important ones. In effect, nearly two-thirds of what is now Karnataka fell outside the rule of the Wodeyar kings of Mysore. In addition the proposed state had six neighbours — Goa, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala — and all had Kannadigas in them.
What this meant for the Kannadigas in these regions was that they were reduced to linguistic minorities wherever they were. Kannadigas in the Hubli-Karnataka region for example, came under the rule of the Bombay presidency where Marathi was the official language. Those in the Hyderabad-Karnataka region came under the Nizam's rule where Urdu ruled.
It was in this backdrop that the movement that first started as a protest against linguistic oppression, soon morphed into one that began demanding a separate state be created consolidating all Kannada speaking regions. This was essentially a movement that was spearheaded by the poets, journalists and writers and was called the Ekikarana or 'Unification' movement.
India gained independence in 1947. The joy of independence soon gave way to disappointment as the new government started dragging its feet on Karnataka Ekikarana movement. Kannada speaking areas now got grouped under five administrative units of the Bombay and Madras provinces, Kodagu, and the princely states of Mysore and Hyderabad. The Akhila Karnataka Ekikarana Parishat met in Kasargod and reiterated the demand for a separate state for Kannadigas.
The ratification in parliament of the recommendations of the Fazal Ali Committee brought joy to the Kannadiga population that now was merged under the state of Mysore.
On 1 November 1973, under Devaraj Urs as chief minister, Mysore state was renamed as Karnataka since it was felt that Karnataka was more 'inclusive' of all the other regions of Karnataka than the name Mysore.
Some of the active Kannada pro organisations include

==Kannada ethnic flag==

The Kannada ethnic flag is a banner with two horizontal stripes, yellow on top and red on the bottom.[tpl]cite web|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/in-ka.html#yr |title=Kannada ethnic flag: |publisher=Flagspot.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl] The flag although neither officially declared nor represents any legendary empire but something which is accepted in recent times unofficially representing a symbol of welfare as turmeric (ಅರಿಶಿಣ) and kumkum (ಕುಂಕುಮ).
