Dalian is a major city and seaport in the south of Liaoning province. It is the southernmost city of Northeast China and China's northernmost warm water port, at the tip of the Liaodong peninsula. Dalian is the province's second largest city and has sub-provincial administrative status; only the provincial capital (Shenyang) is larger. The Shandong peninsula lies southwest across the Bohai Sea; Korea lies across the Yellow Sea to the east. Today a financial, shipping and logistics center for Northeast Asia, Dalian has a significant history of being used by foreign powers for its ports: Dalian proper was previously known as both Dalny ([tpl]lang-ru|Дальний[/tpl]; [tpl]transl|ru-latin|Dal'nii[/tpl]) and Dairen but it was better known as both Port Arthur ([tpl]lang-ru|Порт-Артур|links=no[/tpl]; [tpl]transl|ru|Port-Artur[/tpl]) and Ryojun from its Lüshunkou district. In 2006, Dalian was named China's most livable city by China Daily.

==Names==

Modern Dalian originated from Qingniwa ([tpl]zh|c=青泥窪|p=Qīngníwā|l=blue mud swamp[/tpl]) or Qingniwaqiao ([tpl]zh|c=青泥窪橋|p=Qīngníwāqiáo|l=bridge over the blue mud swamp[/tpl]), a small fishing village. Russia built a commercial town for the Kwantung Leased Territory after assuming control in 1898 and called it "Dalny" ([tpl]lang-ru|Дальний Dal'nii|links=no[/tpl],[tpl]Cite book|title=The Geography of China: Sacred and Historic Places|author=Britannica Educational Publishing|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2010|chapter=The Major Cities of Northern China|isbn=978-1-61530-182-9|pages=165–168[/tpl] lit. "faraway" or "remote", rendered as 達里尼 Dálǐní in Chinese) from 1898–1905. After the Ruso-Japanese war, Japan occupied the Kwantung Leased Territory and renamed the city [tpl]Nihongo|Dairen|大連 / だいれん||lead=yes[/tpl] after the Chinese name for Dalian Bay ([tpl]zh|t=大連灣|s=大连湾|hp=Dàlián Wān|links=no[/tpl]). English sources called the city "Dairen" in this period, from the Japanese.
In 1950, Dalian merged with nearby town called Lüshun (formerly "Port Arthur" and before that, "Ryojun") to form the city of Lüda ([tpl]zh|c=旅大|hp=Lǚdà|links=no[/tpl]), a name formed from the first syllable of each constituent's name which was usually rendered as Luta in English during that era. In 1981, the State Council again renamed the city, from Lüda to "Dalian" ([tpl]zh|t=大連|s=大连|hp=Dàlián|links=no[/tpl], the same Chinese characters as Japanese Dairen), effective 5 March 1981.

==History==

===Ancient===

In the Qin and Han periods (221 BC–AD 220), Chinese colonized northern Korea through the Dalian region, then under the jurisdiction of Liaodong county. During the Sixteen Kingdoms era (3rd through 5th centuries), the kingdom of Goguryeo controlled this region. In the early Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Dalian region was part of Andong Prefecture in Jili state; during the Liao Dynasty (916–1125), it was part of Dong Jing Tong Liaoyang county. Dalian was named Sanshan in the period of Wei Jin (220–420), San Shanpu in the Tang Dynasty (618–907), Sanshan Seaport in the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), and Qingniwakou during the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911).

===Qing Dynasty===

In the 1880s, Jinzhou, the north of downtown within Dalian, now Jinzhou District, was a walled town and center for political intrigue and economic activity. The Qing government built bridges and heavily fortified the peninsula, including with cannons and Western weaponry. Mining camps on the northern coast of Dalian Bay became the small town of Qingniwa or Qingniwaqiao, near what became downtown Dalian.

===British, Russian, and Japanese occupations===

The British occupied Qingniwa in 1858,They also renamed the bay for their queen Victoria. Kuramoto p. 19. but it returned to Chinese control in the 1880s. Port Arthur at the peninsula's tip took its English name from Royal Navy Lieutenant William C. Arthur, but Chinese called it Lüshun. Although China heavily fortified the area, in which it allowed trade with foreigners, Japan swiftly overcame those defenses. Shocked Westerners deplored the invaders killing civilians in the Port Arthur massacre in November 1894. China conceded defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, ceding Korea and making many other concessions in the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895.
The Triple Intervention by France, Germany and Russia forced Japan to return the Liaodong Peninsula to China, despite the treaty's terms; instead the Russian Empire leased the peninsula from the Qing Dynasty in 1898. For Russia the region of the peninsula was of particular interest as one of the few areas in the region that had the potential to develop ice-free ports.Hess, Christian A. (2006). “From colonial jewel to socialist metropolis: Dalian, 1895–1955.” Ph.D. dissertation (University of California, San Diego), p. 17. The Russians built a modern commercial port city, which they wanted to become the Paris of the Far East, and called it Dal'niy (Russian: [tpl]lang-ru|Дальний|links=no[/tpl]).Kuramoto p. 20. Linked to the Trans-Siberian Railway's branch line from Harbin, Dalny became Russia's primary port-city in Asia, and also served other western traders. Russia signed the Pavlov Agreement (1898) with China, which granted Russia a twenty-five year lease on Dalian and Lushun and exclusive right to lay a branch of the Chinese Eastern Railway to them—what would become the South Manchurian Railway.Hess, p. 21. Russia spent more than 10 million golden rubles (equivalent to 11.5 billion of today's rubles) building the new tax-free port city.March, G. Patrick. Eastern Destiny: Russia in Asia and the North Pacific (Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger, 1996)
Russia heavily fortified both Dalny (Qingniwaqiao of Zhongshan District) and the Port Arthur naval base (Lüshunkou) before and after the Boxer Rebellion. Missionaries and converts were killed in the peninsula during the insurrection, although the massive massacres of ethic Chinese Christians including Metrophanes, Chi Sung occurred at Harbin. Also, Western expeditionary forces suppressed the Boxers across the Yellow Sea in Shandong.
During the Russo-Japanese War, the peninsula became a major battleground. Major-General Baron Anatoly Stoessel defended the siege of Port Arthur, for five months, but the Japanese army through long-distance fire in early December managed to sink several Russian ships attempting to relieve him. Admiral Eugene Alexeyeff was blamed for splitting precious resources shipped [tpl]convert|5000|mi|0|abbr=out[/tpl] across the single tracked Trans-Siberian Railway and Manchurian Railway between the Dalian and Port Arthur. After the Japanese navy crippled the remaining Russian destroyer Sevastopol in three weeks of constant attacks, and explosives detonated in tunnels destroyed Fort Arthur's remaining defenses at year's end, Russia surrendered the port on 2 January 1905.
The Treaty of Portsmouth ceded Port Arthur to Japan, which set up the Kwantung Leased Territory or Guandongzhou, on roughly the southern half (Jinzhou District and south) of present-day Dalian. Japanese invested heavily in the region, which became the main trading port between Manchuria and Japan. Japan leased the area from Manchukuo after establishing the puppet state in 1932. In 1937, as the Second Sino-Japanese War began, Japan enlarged and modernized the trade zone as two cities: the northern Dairen (Dalian) and the southern Ryojun (Port Arthur or Lüshun).

===Post-World War II===

With the unconditional surrender of Japan in August 1945, Dairen passed to the Soviets, whose Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation had liberated the city. The Soviets and Chinese Communists cooperated to develop the city, relatively undamaged during the war, especially its industrial infrastructure and the port. The Soviet government rented the port and in 1945 the first Chinese Communist mayor of the new Lüda Administrative Office ([tpl]zh|s=旅大行政公署|links=no[/tpl]) had been appointed. [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
In 1950, the USSR presented the city to the Chinese Communist government without any compensation. Dairen and Lüshun (Port Arthur) emerged as Lüda on 1 December 1950. From 12 March 1953 to 1 August 1954 it was a direct-controlled municipality and not part of Liaoning. Soviet troops left the city in 1955. After the Soviets left, the PRC made Lüda a major shipbuilding center.
In 1981, it was renamed Dalian, with Lüshunkou becoming a constituent district. In 1984, the Chinese Government designated the city a Special Economic Zone. At the time, Dalian was China's largest foreign trade port.China widens doors for foreign capital. Ottawa Citizen (1984-10-03)

===Post 1990===

The city was upgraded from a prefecture-level city to a sub-provincial city in May 1994, with no change in its administrative subdivisions. In the 1990s the city benefited from the attention of Bo Xilai (later Communist Party head of Chongqing) who was both the mayor of the city and one of the major leader in the province, who, among other things, banned motorcycles and planted large, lush parks in the city's many traffic circles. He also preserved much of Dalian's Japanese and Russian architectural heritage. He also worked as former Minister of Commerce of the PRC.
In 2008, about 1000 people protested and blocked traffic as part of the 2008 Tibetan anti-Chinese protests.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,351886,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Anti-Western Protests Flare in Several Chinese Cities – Fox News | date=2011-10-20[/tpl] and forced the temporary closure of the local Carrefour store.[tpl]Wayback |date=20080422223042 |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-04/21/content_6630934.htm |title=Protests continue; restraint urged [/tpl].

==Geography==

One of the most heavily developed industrial areas of China, Dalian City today consists of Dalian proper and the smaller Lüshunkou (formerly Lüshun city, known in western and Russian historic references as Port Arthur), about forty nautical miles farther along the Liaodong Peninsula. Historical references note that the Russian designed city of Dalny (Alt. Dalney), on the south side of Dalian Bay was [tpl]convert|40|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from Port Arthur/Lüshun (known today as Lüshunkou or literally, Lüshun Port).
Dalian is located west of the Yellow Sea and east of Bohai Sea roughly in the middle of the Liaodong peninsula at its narrowest neck or isthmus. With a coastline of [tpl]convert|1906|km|abbr=on[/tpl], it governs the majority of the Liaodong Peninsula and about 260 surrounding islands and reefs. It is seated at south-south-west of the Yalu River, and its harbour entrance forms a sub-bay known as Dalian Bay.

===Climate===

Dalian has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen Dwa), characterised by humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and cold, windy, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Except for winter, the city experiences a one-month seasonal lag due to its position on the Liaodong Peninsula. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from [tpl]convert|−3.9|°C|1[/tpl] in January to [tpl]convert|24.1|°C|1[/tpl] in August. Annual precipitation averages [tpl]convert|602|mm|1[/tpl] but is heavily concentrated in the summer months and can vary greatly from year to year. Due to the coastal location, the mean diurnal temperature variation annually is small, at [tpl]convert|6.75|C-change|1[/tpl]. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 49% in July to 68% in September and October, with 2,740 hours of bright sunshine annually. The annual mean temperature is [tpl]convert|10.90|°C|1[/tpl].

The water quality of offshore marine space remained stable overall. The annual average content of monitoring indicators for water quality met Class-II of the national seawater quality standard, with the exception of Inorganic Nitrogen in Dalian Bay and the city's southern coast. The water quality of drinking water sources is considered good and complies with Class-III of Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water.
Recent events have had a major environmental impact on the city. In July 2010, the explosion of two petroleum pipelines released 11,000 barrels of oil into the Yellow Sea, according to official statements. Rick Steiner, an American marine conservationist working with Greenpeace, says that the figure could be upwards of 400,000.[ref]
