Axel Stordahl (August 8, 1913 – August 30, 1963) was an arranger who was active from the late 1930s through the 1950s. He is perhaps best known for his work with Frank Sinatra in the 1940s at Columbia Records. With his sophisticated orchestrations, Stordahl is credited with helping to bring pop arranging into the modern age.Axel Stordahl Biography (Yahoo! Music FoxyTunes)

==Biography==

Stordahl was born in Staten Island, New York to Norwegian immigrant parents. He began his career as a trumpeter in jazz bands which played in several dance bands around Long Island and the Catskills during the late 1920s and early 1930s. He also began arranging around this time, and in 1933 he joined Bert Bloch's orchestra in both capacities. Over the next couple of years, Stordahl sang on the side in a vocal trio dubbed the Three Esquires.Axel Stordahl, biography (The encyclopedia of big band, lounge, classic jazz and space-age sounds)
In 1935, he joined Tommy Dorsey's new orchestra and soon became the band's main arranger. In January 1940, Sinatra joined the group as vocalist, and it became apparent that Stordahl's arrangements were particularly well suited to the singer's voice.Tommy Dorsey And His Orchestra:  The Early Years  (Michael P. Zirpolo)
In January 1942, Stordahl arranged Sinatra's very first commercial solo recordings (which appeared on the RCA Records sub-label Bluebird), and when Sinatra left Dorsey seven months later to go solo, Stordahl went with him. In the subsequent decade, Sinatra cut close to three hundred sides for Columbia Records, of which three quarters were arranged by Stordahl. In addition, Stordahl provided the orchestral backings, both as arranger and conductor, for several hundreds of songs in various Sinatra radio shows. He was the credited orchestrator for the 1945 Academy Award-winning  picture Anchors Aweigh which starred Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly.The Men Behind the Music – Axel Stordahl (The Palomar)
Stordahl was admired for his skills in framing Sinatra's voice, creating a soft, opulent sound with swirling strings, understated rhythms and woodwinds. He was one of the first American arrangers to tailor his work to the vocal qualities of a specific singer. When Sinatra moved to Capitol Records in 1953, Stordahl arranged his first recording session there (which produced four songs). From then, however, Sinatra worked with Nelson Riddle, who cultivated his jazz-oriented qualities, as well as Gordon Jenkins and Billy May.
Stordahl went on to work with such singers as Bing Crosby, Doris Day, Eddie Fisher, Dinah Shore, and Dean Martin, among others. Although best known as an arranger, Stordahl also composed a number of songs of which Day by Day with music by Axel Stordahl and Paul Weston and lyrics by Sammy Cahn, is the best known. He also composed and orchestrated the theme to the television sitcom series McHale's Navy.[tpl]Allmusic |class=artist |id= p129042|tab= biography|label= Biography of Axel Stordahl|first= Steve |last= Huey|accessdate= 2012-04-17[/tpl]
In 1961, Sinatra returned to collaborate with an already ailing Stordahl for his final Capitol album, Point of No Return.

==Personal life==
