Mark Brandt Dayton (born January 26, 1947) is an American politician and the current and 40th Governor of Minnesota, serving since 2011.[tpl]cite news|last=Yoon |first=Robert |last2=Simon |first2=Jeff |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/12/04/democrat-dayton-wins-minnesota-gov-recount/ |title=Democrat Dayton wins Minnesota Gov. recount |newspaper=CNN |date=December 4, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2012[/tpl] He was previously a United States Senator for Minnesota from 2001 to 2007, and the Minnesota State Auditor from 1991 to 1995. He is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), which affiliates with the national Democratic Party.
A native of Minnesota, Dayton is the great-grandson of businessman George Dayton, the founder of  Dayton's, a department store that later became the Target Corporation. He embarked on a career in teaching and social work in New York City and Boston after graduating from Yale University in 1969.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/local/80179727.html |title=Mark Dayton's career |publisher=Star Tribune |date=2009-12-27 |accessdate=2010-07-20[/tpl] During the 1970s, he served as a legislative aide to U.S. Senator Walter Mondale and Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich. In 1978, Dayton was appointed the Minnesota Economic Development Commissioner and married Alida Rockefeller Messinger, a member of the Rockefeller family.
Dayton gained national attention in 1982 during his unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign against Republican Party incumbent David Durenberger. He defeated former U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy in the Democratic primary, and the general election became the one of the most expensive in state history.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,925732,00.html | work=Time | date=1982-09-27[/tpl] Dayton campaigned as a populist in opposition to Reaganomics and famously promised "to close tax loopholes for the rich and the corporations—and if you think that includes the Daytons, you're right." After his defeat, Dayton returned to the Perpich administration until his election as Minnesota State Auditor in 1990.
In 1998, Dayton ran an unsuccessful campaign for Governor, losing the Democratic nomination to Hubert Humphrey III. In 2000, he was elected to the U.S. Senate after defeating Republican incumbent Rod Grams. As Senator, Dayton voted against the authorization for war in Iraq, and became the first Senator to introduce legislation creating a cabinet-level United States Department of Peace. In 2006, he chose not to seek reelection, citing his disillusionment with Washington D.C. and fundraising.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/02/09_khoom_dayton/ |title=MPR: Dayton won't seek re-election as Minnesota U.S. senator |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date=2005-02-09 |accessdate=2010-07-20[/tpl]
In 2010, Dayton defeated Republican Tom Emmer to become Governor of Minnesota despite national success for the Republican Party, including in the Minnesota legislature. His major legislative initiatives as Governor include the construction of Vikings Stadium for the Minnesota Vikings of the  National Football League (NFL) in Minneapolis, and the legalization of same-sex marriage.http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2013/0513/Minnesota-governor-expected-to-sign-same-sex-marriage-bill-video

News reports of a Dayton question-and-answer session quote the Senator giving himself a "F" grade for his time in the Senate.

===Committee assignments===

===Dayton v. Hanson===

In the 2003 lawsuit Office of Senator Mark Dayton v. Brad Hanson questioned the possibility of the wrongful termination of Brad Hanson. Brad Hanson worked as State Office Manager for Dayton; and when Hanson took medical leave for a heart problem and Senator Dayton fired him shortly thereafter. Hanson sued under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, claiming that Dayton had discriminated against him because of a perceived disability, though Dayton argued that he was immunized from the suit by the "Speech or Debate Clause" of the United States Constitution.[tpl]dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl] Dayton claimed that Hanson's duties were directly related to Dayton's legislative functions, and that the decision to fire him could thus not be challenged. The District Court denied the motion, and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, where oral arguments were heard on April 24, 2007. At issue in the case was whether a U.S. Senator can be sued for wrongful termination or if such legal actions are barred by the Constitution's "speech or debate" clause, which protects lawmakers from having legislative work questioned by courts. The Supreme Court ruled 8-0 that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal and dismissed the case, declining to grant certiorari.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2006/2006_06_618/ |title=Dayton v.

He stated he made that decision because the primary election is a more democratic method of choosing a candidate.

In the general election on November 2, 2010, Dayton led his Republican opponent, Tom Emmer, at the close of balloting by just under 9,000 votes. The margin of victory was small enough to trigger an automatic recount under state law.

===Medical Marijuana===

Until 2013, Dayton opposed the legalization of medical cannabis and drug policy reform, adopting the same position as his Republican predecessor Tim Pawlenty. The Marijuana Policy Project called Dayton "no more favorable" to drug policy reform than the last Republican governor.http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2012/12/mark_dayton_says_hes_against_easing_marijuana_laws.php Dayton was reported to have become more favorable to the legalization of medical cannabis in 2014, but advocates for medical marijuana called the position "smoke and mirrors," and claimed he was deliberately stalling progress on a bill to legalize medical marijuana that would otherwise have enough votes to pass.http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/story/25080180/medical-marijuana-new-support-from-minnesota-governor In a meeting with advocates, Dayton allegedly told a mother of a child with severe epilepsy to buy the drug illegally because he would not sign a bill to legalize it, but he denied having said that. When Dayton posed a $2 million study on medical marijuana with the Mayo Clinic instead of signing a bill to legalize medical marijuana, advocates "bashed" Dayton for not allowing suffering patients to have access to the drug.http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/health/252560401.html City Pages reported that the Governor could lose the vote of the many supporters of medical marijuana, 65% of Minnesotans, to the 3/5 of Republican candidates for governor in 2014 who "strike a more liberal tone on marijuana reform" than the Democratic incumbent.http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2013/10/mngop_guv_hopefuls_strike_more_liberal_tone_on_marijuana_reform_than_mark_dayton.php
