The New York Times reported: The Jews yesterday 19 founded a new settlement called Brur Hayal at the edge of the Negeb desert, in that part of southern Palestine where Egyptian volunteers are reported to be preparing a “second front’’. The colonists are veterans who served with the British Army during World II. They drove a convoy of twenty-four armored trucks to a hilltop situated less than a mile from Arab village of Bureir during the night. When the Arabs awoke they found the Jews setting up prefabricated houses and building a defensive wall and watchtower. The Arabs promptly opened fire, but by noon the houses and the wall were in place.[tpl]cite news | newspaper = New York Times | date = April 21, 1948 | title = Big convoy fights way to Jerusalem | author = Dana Adams Schmidt | page = 18[/tpl]
