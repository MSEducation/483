The Hong Kong Museum of History ([tpl]zh|c=香港歷史博物館|j=Hoeng1 Gong2 Lik6 Si2 Bok3 Mat6 Gun2|p=Xiānggǎng Lìshǐ Bówùguǎn[/tpl]) is a museum which preserves Hong Kong's historical and cultural heritage. It is located next to the Hong Kong Science Museum, in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China.
The collections of the museum encompass natural history, archaeology, ethnography and local history.

==History==

The museum was established by the Urban Council in July 1975 when the City Museum and Art Gallery was split into the Hong Kong Museum of History and Hong Kong Museum of Art; some of the Museum of History's collections were on display at the City Museum and Art Gallery's original 1962 location at the City Hall. 
In 1983, the Museum was moved to a temporary location (which now houses Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre) in Kowloon Park. It was moved to its present premises near Hong Kong Science Museum on Chatham Road South, Tsim Sha Tsui in 1998.  It is currently managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of Hong Kong Government.
