The Radiant AI is a technology developed by Bethesda for The Elder Scrolls video games. This allows non-player characters (NPCs) to make choices and engage in behaviors more complex than in past titles. This technology was developed for Oblivion and expanded in Skyrim, and is also used in Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, also published by Bethesda.[tpl]cite web| url=http://kotaku.com/5022866/cannabalism-slavery-and-sex-in-fallout-3| title=Cannabalism, Slavery and Sex in Fallout 3| date=2008-07-08| publisher=Kotaku| quote=Like Oblivion, we use our Radiant AI system, so most of the NPCs eat, sleep, work, etc| accessdate=2012-01-29[/tpl]

==Technology==

The Radiant A.I. technology, as it evolved in its latest iteration developed for Skyrim, comprises two parts:

===Radiant A.I.===

The Radiant A.I. system deals with NPC interactions and behavior. It allows non-player characters to dynamically react to and interact with the world around them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamechronicles.com/qa/elderscrolls4/oblivion.htm |title=Developers Corner: The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion |first=Mat |last=Houghton |publisher=Game Chronicles |accessdate=2007-08-11[/tpl] General goals, such as "Eat at this city at 2pm" are given to NPCs, and NPCs are left to determine how to achieve them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/Elder-Scrolls-IV-Oblivion-Interview/Item859.aspx |title=Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Interview |first=Charles |last=Husemann |date=2005-06-02 |accessdate=2007-08-11 |publisher=Gaming Nexus[/tpl] The absence of individual scripting for each character allows for the construction of a world on a much larger scale than other games had developed, and aids in the creation of what Todd Howard described as an "organic feel" for the game

===Radiant Story===

The Radiant Story system deals with how the game itself reacts to the player behavior, such as the creation of new dynamic quests. Dynamically generated quests are placed by the game in locations the player hasn't visited yet and are related to earlier adventures.[tpl]cite web | url=http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/27/bethesdas-nesmith-reflects-on-the-difficult-birth-of-skyrims-radiant-story-system/ | title=Bethesda’s Nesmith reflects on the difficult birth of Skyrim’s ‘Radiant Story’ system | date=2012-01-27 | publisher=VentureBeat | accessdate=2012-01-29[/tpl]
