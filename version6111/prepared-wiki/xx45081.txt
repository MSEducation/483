[[Spenserian stanza]]

CATEGORIES: Stanzaic form, Epic poetry

The Spenserian stanza is a fixed verse form invented by Edmund Spenser for his epic poem The Faerie Queene.  Each stanza contains nine lines in total: eight lines in iambic pentameter followed by a single 'alexandrine' line in iambic hexameter. The rhyme scheme of these lines is "ababbcbcc."

==Example Stanza==

This example is the first stanza from Spenser's Faerie Queene.  The formatting, wherein all lines but the first and last are indented, is the same as in contemporary printed editions.

==Possible Influences==

Spenser's invention may have been influenced by the Italian form ottava rima, which consists of eight lines of iambic pentameter with the rhyme scheme "abababcc."  This form was used by Spenser's Italian role models Ludovico Ariosto and Torquato Tasso.  
Another possible influence is rhyme royal, a traditional medieval form used by Geoffrey Chaucer and others, which has seven lines of iambic pentameter that rhyme "ababbcc."  More likely, however, is the eight-line ballad stanza with the rhyme scheme "ababbcbc," which Chaucer used in his Monk's Tale.  Spenser would have been familiar with this rhyme scheme and simply added a line to the stanza, forming "ababbcbcc."A Spenser Handbook, by H.S.V. Jones.

==Use by Others==

Spenser's verse form fell into disuse in the period immediately following his death.  However, it was revived in the nineteenth century by several notable poets, including:
