==History==

WDM started in 1969 as 'Action for World Development' (AWD).  Many people who were involved in collecting one million signatures on a petition about world development had seen the need for political campaigning which charity law restricted development charities from undertaking.  AWD was formally launched by aid agencies such as Oxfam and Christian Aid, and by churches. 
WDM, formed in 1970, extended the work of AWD but as a separate body with its own member groups to decide its policies and priorities. WDM's constitution was subsequently changed to allow individuals as well as local groups to become members. 
WDM has an associated charity, the WDM Trust, which funds WDM’s charitable activities.[tpl]cite web | title=WDM Annual review for 2005 | url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/about/annrep/2005/finance.htm | accessdate=2007-02-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070218142406/http://www.wdm.org.uk/about/annrep/2005/finance.htm  |archivedate = 2007-02-18[/tpl]
WDM was a co-founder of the Fairtrade Foundation in 1992, Jubilee 2000 in 1997, the Trade Justice Movement in 2000, and the 2005 anti-poverty mobilisation Make Poverty History.  
In late 2006, WDM moved its London offices from Brixton to new premises at 66 Offley Road in Kennington, London.

==Climate change==

WDM considers climate change to be a climate justice issue.  In 2009 they successfully campaigned to stop new coal-fired power station in Kingsnorth, Kent and Hunterston in Ayrshire because the organisation considered any plans for new coal fired power stations to be incompatible with plans to tackle climate change.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
From 2010 WDM ran a campaign on climate debt opposing the UK government's plans to give money in the form of climate loans to already heavily indebted poor countries in the global South.http://www.wdm.org.uk/climate-debt-campaign/what-wdm-doing
