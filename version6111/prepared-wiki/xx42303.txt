Leonardo Cruz (born January 17, 1953 in Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic), better known in the world of boxing as Leo Cruz, was a world Jr. Featherweight champion from the Dominican Republic.

==Personal==

Leo was the brother of Carlos Cruz, a man whom many recognize as one of the greatest fighters to come out of the Dominican Republic. His brother Carlos had conquered the world Lightweight title by beating Carlos Ortiz in 1969, and was on his way to a rematch with Ortiz at San Juan, when his Dominicana De Aviación DC-9 jet crashed shortly after take-off, killing everyone on board. With that, Leo had to learn how to deal with life's hardships at a very young age (see: Dominicana DC-9 air disaster).

==Early life==

Leo moved to Puerto Rico early in the 1970s, and began identifying himself as half Puerto Rican almost immediately.

==Pro career==

He began his successful professional boxing career in Puerto Rico, with a string of wins. Despite having beaten future two time world champion Lupe Pintor, however, Cruz was still a virtual unknown when given a chance to win the WBC world Jr. Featherweight championship. Despite losing by a knockout in the 13th round against world champion Wilfredo Gómez,[tpl]cite news|last=Perez|first=Santos|title=Palma vs. Cruz, one more time|work=The Miami News|date=1982-06-10|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8rgmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cQIGAAAAIBAJ&pg=3158,2702626|accessdate=2010-12-17[/tpl] his stock around the boxing world rose after that fight. Cruz kept on fighting, and winning, until he was given a second world title try, this time by the WBA world champion Sergio Palma, in Buenos Aires. Cruz was beaten by a decision in 15 by the Argentine world champion, but in a rematch on February 1982 at Miami, Cruz became world champion by defeating Palma by a decision, also in 15 rounds.[tpl]cite news|title=Fans' Spirit Helps Cruz Earn Decision|work=Gainesville Sun|agency=Associated Press|date=1982-06-14|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hXMfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sukDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4220,5221967|accessdate=2010-12-17[/tpl]
