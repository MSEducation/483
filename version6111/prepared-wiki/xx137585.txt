Metro Tezozómoc is a metro station on Mexico's Line 6. Its logo is a profile of King Tezozómoc, who ruled the Aztec for 80 years.  The station can be accessed through Ahuehuetes and Avenida Sauces Colonia Pasteros, in the Azcapotzalco borough. It has no underground direct connections, which means that, in order to exchange platforms, one has to exit the station and cross the street, thus making it necessary to pay the fare again, a feature only shared with Metro Allende in Line 2.Inauguraciones por orgen cronológico, longitudes de la línea, estaciones, correspondencias, estaciones elevadas, aéreas y subterráneas, afluencias, logotipos del Metro, icono ...
