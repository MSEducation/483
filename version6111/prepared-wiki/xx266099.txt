==Music video==

Directed by Meiert Avis, on August 9 and 10 in Malibu, California, the music video opens in similar fashion to that of the music video for the song "Yellow" by Coldplay, with Gavin Rossdale walking down the beach on a cold, grey morning singing the first verse and chorus. Afterwards the video unfolds into a blissful summer party with jamming, shooting pool, and guitar playing on the beach. Chris Traynor's wife and daughter also appear in the video.[tpl]cite web|url=http://onesecondbush.com/bush/media/videos/ |title=Music Video History at OneSecondBush.com - A Comprehensive Fan Site For The Band Bush |publisher=Onesecondbush.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04[/tpl]
