==Corretjer marries Oscar De La Hoya==

In 2000, Oscar De La Hoya recorded his first music album. In the studio, while trying to record songs for his album, De La Hoya was finding it difficult to sing with more passion. To demonstrate passionate singing, his producer Rudy Perez showed him "Una Voz en el Alma", one of Corretjer's music videos from the previous album that he had produced for Millie. De La Hoya asked for the name of the singer in the video, and the producer replied that she was a singer and actress named Millie Corretjer, who had previously worked with him.
De La Hoya at the time, asked that Corretjer be the model on his next music video. After meeting each other on an EMI convention in Texas, Corretjer and De La Hoya fell in love and began dating. Corretjer and De La Hoya were married on October 5, 2001, in a secret ceremony in San Juan.
Millie made an appearance in an Oscar video "Para Que" and years later Oscar did the same in Millie's latest album "En Cuerpo y Alma" for the song video "En Cuerpo y Alma".
