Some colloquial speech contains a great deal of slang, but some contains no slang at all. Slang is permitted in colloquial language, but it is not a necessary element. Other examples of colloquial usage in English include contractions or profanity.
In the philosophy of language the term "colloquial language" refers to ordinary natural language, as distinct from specialized forms used in logic or other areas of philosophy.[tpl]cite book|last=Davidson|first=Donald|editor=Peter Ludlow|title=Readings in the Philosophy of Language|year=1997|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-62114-4|pages=89–107|chapter=Truth and meaning[/tpl] In the field of logical atomism, meaning is evaluated in a different way than with more formal propositions.[tpl]Clarify|date=April 2014[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Distinction from other styles==

Colloquialisms are distinct from slang or jargon. Slang refer to words used only by specific social groups, such as teenagers or soldiers.[tpl]Cite book|last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil’ad |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |year=2003[/tpl] Colloquial language may include slang, but also forms such as contractions or other informal words known to most native speakers of the language.
Jargon is terminology that is especially defined in relationship to a specific activity, profession or group. The term refers to the language used by people who work in a particular area or who have a common interest. Much like slang, it is a kind of shorthand used to express ideas that are frequently discussed between members of a group, though it can also be developed deliberately using chosen terms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=10866|  title=Buzzwords– bang * splat !| last=Lundin|first=Leigh| date=2009-12-31|  publisher=Criminal  Brief|work=Don Martin School of Software[/tpl] Whilst a standard term may be given a more precise or unique usage amongst practitioners of relevant disciplines, it is often reported that jargon is a barrier to communication for those people unfamiliar with the respective field.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Examples==

Colloquialisms are often geographical in nature, and used in everyday speech. Words that have a formal meaning can also have a colloquial meaning.
Auxiliary languages are sometimes assumed to lack colloquialisms, but this varies from one language to another. In Interlingua, the same standards of eligibility apply to colloquialisms as to other terms. Thus, any widely used, international colloquialism may be used in Interlingua. Expressions such as en las manos de... ("in the hands of...") and Que pasa? ("What's going on?") are not uncommon.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
An example of a colloquialism and how it migrates to other areas is the Indian phrase, "Please do the needful", meaning, "Please do what is implied and/or expected".  As the global workplace expands, this once regional phrase is now being used outside the area in which it originated.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
