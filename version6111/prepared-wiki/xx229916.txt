The Monnett Moni is a sport aircraft developed in the United States in the early 1980s and marketed for homebuilding. 
Designed by John Monnett, who coined the term "Air Recreation Vehicle" to describe it, it was a single-seat motorglider with a low, cantilever wing and a V-tail. Construction was of metal throughout, and it was intended to be easy and inexpensive to build and fly.  Like many sailplanes, the main undercarriage was a single monowheel, which in this case was mounted in a streamlined fairing beneath the fuselage and was not retractable, with a steerable tailwheel behind it. Builders were also given the option of constructing their example with fixed tricycle undercarriage.Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1984-85, 756 Power was provided by a small two-cylinder, horizontally opposed, air-cooled engine.
Examples of the Moni are on display at the Steven F.
