He served as the treasurer of the party from its foundation in 1913 to 1914. In 1914 Kanshi Ram returned to India as a part of the Indo-German Conspiracy (Ghadar Conspiracy) which attempted to trigger mutinies in the British Indian Army during World War I. He was arrested in the aftermath of the failed February plot and later tried in the Lahore conspiracy trial. Pandit Kanshi Ram was executed along with Kartar Singh Sarabha and Vishnu Ganesh Pingle on November 1916.
