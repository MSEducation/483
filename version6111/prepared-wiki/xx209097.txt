This bacteria is an obligate intracellular pathogen affecting monocytes and macrophages.

==Ecology & Epidemiology==

In the USA, HME occurs across the south-central, southeastern, and mid-Atlantic states, regions where both the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum) thrive.
HME occurs in California in Ixodes pacificus ticks and in Dermacentor variabilis ticks.[tpl]cite journal |author=Holden K, Boothby JT, Anand S, Massung RF |title=Detection of Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) from a coastal region of California |journal=J. Med. Entomol. |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=534–9 |date=July 2003 |pmid=14680123 |doi= 10.1603/0022-2585-40.4.534 [/tpl]
Nearly 600 cases were reported to the CDC in 2006.  In 2001-2002, the incidence was highest in Missouri, Tennessee, and Oklahoma, as well as in people older than 60.CDC Ehrlichiosis statistics

==Symptoms==

The most common symptoms are fever, headache, malaise, and muscle aches (myalgia).  Compared to human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, rash is more common.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dumler JS, Choi KS, Garcia-Garcia JC, et al. |title=Human granulocytic anaplasmosis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=11 |issue=12 |pages=1828–34 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16485466 |doi= |url=[/tpl]  Laboratory abnormalities include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver tests.
The severity of the illness can range from minor or asymptomatic to life-threatening.  CNS involvement may occur.  A serious septic or toxic shock-like picture can also develop, especially in patients with impaired immunity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Paddock CD, Folk SM, Shore GM, et al. |title=Infections with Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia ewingii in persons coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=33 |issue=9 |pages=1586–94 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11568857 |doi=10.1086/323981 |url=[/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

Tick exposure is often overlooked.  For patients living in high-prevalence areas who spend time outdoors, a high degree of clinical suspicion should be employed.
Ehrlichia serologies can be negative in the acute period.  PCR is therefore the laboratory diagnostic tool of choice.[tpl]cite journal |author=Prince LK, Shah AA, Martinez LJ, Moran KA |title=Ehrlichiosis: making the diagnosis in the acute setting |journal=Southern Medical Journal |volume=100 |issue=8 |pages=825–8 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17713310 |doi= |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0038-4348&volume=100&issue=8&spage=825[/tpl]

==Treatment==

If Ehrlichiosis is suspected, treatment should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive laboratory confirmation, as prompt doxycycline therapy has been associated with improved outcomes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hamburg BJ, Storch GA, Micek ST, Kollef MH |title=The importance of early treatment with doxycycline in human ehrlichiosis |journal=Medicine |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=53–60 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18344803 |doi=10.1097/MD.0b013e318168da1d |url=[/tpl]  Doxycycline is the treatment of choice. 
Presentation during early pregnancy can complicate treatment.[tpl]cite journal |author=Muffly T, McCormick TC, Cook C, Wall J |title=Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis complicating early pregnancy |journal=Infect Dis Obstet Gynecol |volume=2008 |issue= |pages=359172 |year=2008 |pmid=18509484 |pmc=2396214 |doi=10.1155/2008/359172[/tpl]
Rifampin has been used in pregnancy and in patients allergic to doxycycline.[tpl]cite journal |author=Krause PJ, Corrow CL, Bakken JS |title=Successful treatment of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis in children using rifampin |journal=Pediatrics |volume=112 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=e252–3 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12949322 |doi= 10.1542/peds.112.3.e252|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12949322[/tpl]
