Disgraceful was Dubstar's debut album. It was released in October 1995 on the Food Records label, a division of EMI that was also home to Blur.

==Artwork censorship==

Disgraceful's cover underwent a revision  after some time on general release.  The original cover—pictured here—contained a furry blue pencil case with a balloon inside, creating a somewhat labia-like effect.  This was later revised to the current, slightly less blatant bunny slipper design.  Some[tpl]who|date=July 2010[/tpl] have contested this move as censorship which entirely misconstrues the tongue -in-cheek humour of the original.
