Martin Austin Ruane (10 October 1946 – 29 November 1998) was an English professional wrestler. Best known by his ring name, Giant Haystacks, he wrestled in Canada, India, Rhodesia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Ruane was known for his massive physical size, billed as standing [tpl]height|ft=6|in=11[/tpl] tall and weighing [tpl]convert|48|st[/tpl] at his heaviest.

==Early life==

Martin Ruane was born in London, England weighing 14 lb 6 oz. His parents were originally from County Mayo in Ireland.Richard Holt, ‘Ruane, Martin Austin (1946–1998)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 When he was 3, in 1949, Ruane and his family moved north from London to Swinton in Salford, which remained his home. He worked as a labourer and as a nightclub bouncer before a friend suggested he take up professional wrestling as a career.

==Professional wrestling career==

Ruane began wrestling in 1967, initially for the independent WFGB as Luke McMasters (later incorrectly reported as being his legal name).The Wrestling Simon Garfield, Faber & Faber 1996 In the early 1970s, Ruane worked for Wrestling Enterprises (of Birkenhead), where he was billed as Haystacks Calhoun, after the American wrestling star William Calhoun who had wrestled under that name in NWA: All-Star Wrestling and the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Ruane's name was subsequently modified to Giant Haystacks.

===Joint Promotions===

In 1975, he moved to Joint Promotions, where he formed a heel tag team with Big Daddy (also a heel at this point). Haystacks' TV debut came in July that year, when he and Daddy teamed up against the brothers Roy and Tony StClair, losing by disqualification. Although mainly known as brutal superheavyweight heels who crushed blue-eye opponents, they also had a major feud with masked fellow heel Kendo Nagasaki.
Daddy in particular heard cheers during this feud and eventually completed a turn to blue eye. This was cemented when Haystacks and Daddy broke up their tag team in 1977 and feuded with each other, with Haystacks remaining as the heel, resulting in high ratings on Britain's ITV any time they battled one another and establishing Haystacks as a household name during the 1970s and 1980s. The feud would continue on and off until Daddy's retirement in 1993.

===International appearances===

Throughout Haystacks' homeland success he also wrestled all over the world. Ruane wrestled in Calgary, Alberta, Canada for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling promotion as The Loch Ness Monster, managed by J.R. Foley from Wigan, England (alias John Foley, alumnus of Billy Riley's Wigan Snakepit wrestling school).
