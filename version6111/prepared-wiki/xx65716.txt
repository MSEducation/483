The seven dirty words (or "Filthy Words") are seven English-language words that American comedian George Carlin first listed in 1972 in his monologue "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television".[tpl]cite web |author=Doug Linder |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/filthywords.html |title=Filthy Words by George Carlin |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-02-18[/tpl] The words are: shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.
At the time, the words were considered highly inappropriate and unsuitable for broadcast on the public airwaves in the United States, whether radio or television. As such, they were avoided in scripted material, and bleep censored in the rare cases in which they were used; broadcast standards differ in different parts of the world, then and now, although most of the words on Carlin's original list remain taboo on American broadcast television as of 2014. The list was not an official enumeration of forbidden words, but rather was compiled by Carlin. Nonetheless, a radio broadcast featuring these words led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that helped establish the extent to which the federal government could regulate speech on broadcast television and radio in the United States.

==Background==

During one of Lenny Bruce's performances in 1966, he said he was arrested for saying nine words, and says them in alphabetical order: ass, balls, cocksucker, cunt, fuck, motherfucker, piss, shit, tits.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070302/ |title=The Lenny Bruce Performance Film |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-02-18[/tpl] The last seven words are the same as George Carlin's.
In 1972, George Carlin released an album of stand-up comedy entitled Class Clown. One track on the album was "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television," a monologue in which he identified these words, expressing amazement that these particular words could not be used, regardless of context. He was arrested for disturbing the peace when he performed the routine at a show at Summerfest in Milwaukee.
On his next album, 1973's Occupation: Foole, Carlin performed a similar routine titled "Filthy Words," dealing with the same list and many of the same themes. Pacifica station WBAI broadcast this version of the routine uncensored on October 30 that year.

==Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation==

John Douglas, an active member of Morality in Media, claimed that he heard the WBAI broadcast while driving with his then 15-year-old son and complained to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that the material was inappropriate for the time of day.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbs12.com/news/douglas_4708282___article.html/one_radio.html |title=Boca Man Forever Linked To George Carlin |publisher=WPEC |date=June 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080628153847/http://www.cbs12.com/news/douglas_4708282___article.html/one_radio.html |archivedate=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2014-02-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Samaha |first=Adam |url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/314-as-story.pdf |title=The Story of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation (and Its Second Life) |accessdate=2011-10-05[/tpl]
Following the lodging of the complaint, the FCC proceeded to ask Pacifica for a response, then issued a declaratory order upholding the complaint. No specific sanctions were included in the order, but WBAI was put on notice that "in the event subsequent complaints are received, the Commission will then decide whether it should utilize any of the available sanctions it has been granted by Congress." WBAI appealed this decision, which was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in a 2–1 decision on the grounds that the FCC's definition of "indecency" was overbroad and vague and thus violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. The FCC in turn appealed to the Supreme Court. As an independent federal agency, the FCC filed the appeal in its own name. The United States Department of Justice intervened in the case, supporting Pacifica's argument that the FCC's declaratory ruling violated the First Amendment and that it also violated the Fifth Amendment in that the FCC's definition of "indecency" was too vague to support criminal penalties. In 1978 the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, ruled that the FCC's Declaratory Ruling did not violate either the First or Fifth Amendments, but in so ruling it limited the scope of its ruling to the specific broadcast that gave rise to the Declaratory Ruling and declined to consider whether the FCC's definition of indecency would survive a First Amendment challenge if applied to the broadcast of other material containing the same or similar words which had been cited in Pacifica's brief (e.g., works of Shakespeare – "pissing conduits," "bawdy hand of the dial on the prick of noon"; the Bible – "he who pisseth against the wall", the Watergate Tapes). It noted that while the Declaratory Ruling pertained to the meaning of the term indecency as used in a criminal statute (18 USC 1464), since the FCC had not imposed any penalty on Pacifica for the broadcast of words that came within the FCC's definition of "indecent," it did not need to reach the question as to whether the definition was too vague to satisfy the due process requirements of the Fifth Amendment.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/faclibrary/case.aspx?case=Federal_Communications_Commission_v_Pacifica |title=First Amendment Library entry on the case |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040517031200/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/faclibrary/case.aspx?case=Federal_Communications_Commission_v_Pacifica |archivedate=2004-05-17 |accessdate=2014-02-18[/tpl]
This decision formally established indecency regulation in American broadcasting. In follow-up rulings, the Supreme Court established the safe-harbor provision that grants broadcasters the right to broadcast indecent (but not obscene) material between the hours of 10 pm and 6 am, when it is presumed many children will be asleep.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.erenkrantz.com/Humor/SevenDirtyWords.shtml |title=Seven Dirty Words You Can't Say on TV – script |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-02-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://newsbuckit.blogspot.com/2007/02/seven-words-you-can-never-say-on.html |title=Seven words you can never say on television"... but which are said on the Internet.

The FCC regulations regarding "fleeting" use of expletives were ruled unconstitutionally vague by a three-judge panel of the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on July 13, 2010, as they violated the First Amendment due to their possible effects regarding free speech.[tpl]cite web|last=Puzzanghera |first=Jim |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/49922038-68/court-fcc-indecency-expletives.html.csp |title="FCC indecency rule struck down by appeals court," Los Angeles Times, July 13, 2010 |publisher=Sltrib.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-fcc-indecency-20100714,0,5995911.story |title=FCC indecency rule struck down by appeals court – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2011-08-01 |first1=Jim |last1=Puzzanghera |first2=Meg |last2=James[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/business/media/14indecent.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=court%2520ruling%2520on%2520language&st=cse |date=July 13, 2010 |author=Edward Wyatt |title=F.C.C.

==The words==

The original seven words are:
In his comedy special Carlin commented that at one point, a man asked him to remove motherfucker because, as a derivative of fuck, it constituted a duplication.[ref]
