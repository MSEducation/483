[[Lobar the Wolf]]

CATEGORIES: Mercenaries

Lobar the Wolf was the leader of a troupe of Brabançon mercenaries which had fought in numerous battles all across Europe in the latter half of the twelfth century. He is a shadowy historical figure. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, mercenary bands were commonly known by their nationality, though there were many exceptions. The Brabançons were initially the most successful of these national mercenary troops.
Lobar was active in southern France serving Raymond V of Toulouse and his allies and was consequently labelled a heretic by Catholic authorities. He succeeded William of Cambrai after the latter's death in the Battle of Malemort in 1177. On the same day as Cambrai died, Lobar and the viscount of Turenne led an assault on the town of Ségur and sacked it.
