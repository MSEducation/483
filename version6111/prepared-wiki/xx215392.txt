U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps blasted a new world record to defend his title in the event, and more importantly, claim his sixth Olympic gold, twelfth career, and fourteenth overall medal. He established a sterling time of 1:54.23 to lower his prior standard from the Olympic trials by almost six-tenths of a second (0.60). Hungary's László Cseh added a third silver to his collection, finishing with a European record of 1:56.52. Phelps' teammate and archrival Ryan Lochte earned a bronze in a time of 1:56.53, just a hundredth of a second (0.01) behind Cseh. The podium placements also replicated the results of the 400 m individual medley, held on the first day of the Games.[tpl]cite news|last=Lohn|first=John|title=Olympics, Swimming: Michael Phelps Wins Sixth Gold, World Record in 200 IM|url=http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/18829.asp|publisher=Swimming World Magazine|date=14 August 2008|accessdate=17 May 2013[/tpl][ref][tpl]cite news|last=Crouse|first=Karen|title=Phelps Moves 200 Meters Closer to His Goal|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/15/sports/olympics/15swim.html?_r=0|publisher=New York Times|date=15 August 2008|accessdate=17 May 2013[/tpl]
