Frankfurt–Hahn Airport ([tpl]lang-de|Flughafen Frankfurt-Hahn[/tpl], [tpl]airport codes|HHN|EDFH|p=n[/tpl]) is a commercial airport located [tpl]convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from the town of Kirchberg and [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from the town of Simmern in the Rhein-Hunsrück district of Rhineland-Palatinate to the west of central Germany. 
Despite its name, the airport is virtually equidistant between Frankfurt and Luxembourg - about [tpl]convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to each city by road. It is closer to the German cities of Koblenz (about [tpl]convert|70|km|mi|disp=or[/tpl]) and Mainz (about [tpl]convert|90|km|mi|disp=or[/tpl]). The addition of Frankfurt to its name is not an invention of low-cost carriers as is the case with some other airports - Frankfurt-Hahn is the airport's official name.

==History==

During the Cold War Frankfurt–Hahn Airport was a frontline NATO facility known as Hahn Air Base. Hahn Air Base was the home of the United States Air Force 50th Fighter Wing (in various designations) for most of those years as part of the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). It was one of several USAFE bases in Germany (Zweibrücken, Ramstein, Sembach, Bitburg, Spangdahlem, and Rhein-Main) all within [tpl]convert|100|km|mi[/tpl] of each other. Beyond their location in the heart of US troop concentrations, these air bases were well situated to reach all locations within Europe and the Mediterranean region.
On 30 September 1993, most of Hahn Air Base was turned over to civil German authorities. The USAF retained a small portion as a communications site until 2012.News Release No. 811-11: DOD Announces Return of Facilities in Germany, 22 Sep 2011 – DOD News Release 22 Sep 2012  It is also frequently used for military charters, these flights being operated by, amongst others, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines.
The German government decided to turn the former airfield into a civil airport. One of the main investors in the development of the new Frankfurt–Hahn Airport was Fraport, which primarily runs Frankfurt Airport, the aim being to reduce the amount of traffic using that airport. In 2009 Fraport sold its 65% Frankfurt–Hahn shares for €1 including debt of €120 million to the federal state Rhineland-Palatinate.[tpl]Citation | last = Klingelschmit | first = Klaus-Peter | title = Flughafen für 1 Euro gekauft | newspaper = die Tageszeitung |date = 9 February 2009 | url = http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/wirtschaft/artikel/1/flughafen-fuer-1-euro-gekauft/|language=German |accessdate=20 May 2012[/tpl]
Hahn charges its airline operators less due to its remote location. This has made the airport popular with low-cost carriers, especially Ryanair which uses the airport as a major base. Hahn also serves as a major cargo airport, the fifth largest in Germany. The world record for heaviest single-piece of air cargo, a 189.98 metric tonne generator for a gas power plant in Armenia, was set on a cargo flight departing from Hahn in 2009 using the Antonov 225.Hahn–Airport official website – Press release August 12, 2009.
Ryanair announced the cancellation and reduction of several routes for summer 2014 as three of nine based aircraft are removed.http://www.airliners.de/ryanair-streicht-angebot-am-hahn-weiter-zusammen/31186
In January 2014 it has been announced that the airport has accumulated debts of € 125 million while passenger and cargo traffic are decreasing. Due to this figures a closure of the airport within the next ten years is not excluded.http://www.austrianaviation.net/news-international/news-detail/datum/2014/01/30/frankfurt-hahn-vor-dem-aus.html

==Infrastructure==

===Terminals===

The airport consists of one passenger and one cargo terminal. The passenger terminal is equipped with some shops and restaurants, for example a branch of McDonald's.http://www.hahn-airport.de/default.aspx?menu=restaurants&cc=en The apron features eleven stands for mid-sized aircraft such as the Boeing 737 which are reached by walk-boarding. The cargo apron features three stands for large aircraft such as the Boeing 747-8F.

===Runway===

Frankfurt–Hahn has a long runway of [tpl]convert|3800|m|ft|0[/tpl] in the direction of 03/21. This combined with a large apron allows it to handle some of the world's biggest aircraft such as the Antonov An-124 or the Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter, both types being frequent visitors. It has an Instrument Landing System available to both sides, with runway 21 being category 3 approved; low visibility conditions being a frequent problem at the airport, especially during autumn and winter.
