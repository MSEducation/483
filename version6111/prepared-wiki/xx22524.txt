[[Haijin]]

CATEGORIES: Ming dynasty, Qing dynasty

The Haijin ([tpl]zh|c=[tpl]linktext|海|禁[/tpl]|p=Hǎi Jìn|l=sea ban[/tpl]) order was a ban on maritime activities imposed during China's Ming Dynasty and again at the time of the Qing Dynasty. Intended to curb piracy, the ban proved ineffective for that purpose. Instead it imposed huge hardships on coastal communities and legitimate sea traders.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==Ming policy==

The Ming Hongwu Emperor was the first to propose a policy to ban all maritime shipping in 1371.Von Glahn, Richard.  1996 (1996).  Fountain of Fortune: money and monetary policy in China, 1000–1700.  University of California Press.  ISBN 0-520-20408-5
The Hǎi Jĩn policy consisted of three strategies.
The ban was lifted in 1405, reinstated in 1550 then lifted again in 1567.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
The earliest possible date for implementation of the policy was 1368, the year that the Ming Dynasty came to power whilst the latest possible year when it was terminated was 1567.[tpl]Cite book|last=Deng|first=Gang|year=1999|title= Maritime Sector, Institutions, and Sea Power of Premodern China|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-30712-1[/tpl]

==Qing policy==

Koxinga, also known as Zheng Chenggong, was a military leader from the Ming government located in the coastal region, capable of threatening the Qing.  In 1647, another sea ban was issued to limit foreign trade with severe punishment imposed.  In 1655 the "Frontier Shift" was imposed in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shandong.  It required coastal residents to move in land 30–50 li (est. 15 to 25 kilometers).  All private boats and ships were burned. Small rafts were not allowed at sea.  In 1684, the ban was stopped, trading was reopened under the Kangxi Emperor.  In 1685 a "Taxation Rule for Sea Trade" was drafted by Yiergetu.[tpl]cite book |last1=Li |first1=Qingxin |last2=Wang |first2=William W |title=Maritime silk road  |trans_title=五洲传播出版社, Hai shang si chou zhi lu |year=2006 |publisher=China Intercontinental Press |location=Beijing, China |language=English, translated from Mandarin Chinese |isbn=978-7-5085-0932-7 |oclc=180191537[/tpl]

==Controversy==

The ban was also seen as a deceptive proposal, since it prevented the rise of any self-sufficient economies along the coast. Eventually new economies could not be born, and no power was drawn away from the existing imperial courts,[tpl]cite book |last1=Embree |first1=Ainslie Thomas | author1-link=Ainslie Embree |last2=Gluck |first2=Carol |authorlink2=Carol Gluck  |title=Asia in western and world history : a guide for teaching |year=1997 |publisher=M.E.

The law proved a great hardship for coastal dwellers and stimulated rebellions, piracy and a huge wave of overseas migration. Traditionally, southeast Asia was the preferred destination for Chinese emigrants (see Liang Daoming).
