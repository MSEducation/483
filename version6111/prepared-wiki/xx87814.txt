==Eastern Orthodox theology==

The term phronema is used in Eastern Orthodox theology to one particular mindset or outlook' –  the Orthodox mind.The appeal to Tradition was actually an appeal to the mind of the Church, her phronema. It was a method to discover and ascertain the faith as it had been always held, from the very beginning: semper creditum. The permanence of Christian belief was the most conspicuous sign and token of its truth: no innovations further discussion of this topic see my articles: "The Function of Tradition in the Ancient Church," The Greek Orthodox Theological Review, IX (No. 2, 1964), 181-200, and "Scripture and Tradition: An Orthodox point of view," Dialog, II (No. 4, 1963), 288-293. Cf. also "Revelation and Interpretation," in: Biblical Authority for Today, edited by Alan Richardson and W. Schweitzer (London and Philadelphia, 1951), pp. 163-180. On Church and Tradition. An Eastern Orthodox View by Archpriest George Florovsky (1893-1979) http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/church_tradition_florovsky.htm The attaining of phronema in this sense is a matter of practicing the correct faith (orthodoxia) in the correct manner (orthopraxis). Attaining phronema is regarded as the first step toward theosis, the state of glorification''. http://orthodoxinfo.com/phronema/
