==History==

The band began as a product of the development of bedroom songwriters Martin Smith and Lloyd Carter. From an early age, they worked on various projects with local drummer Danny Star, and with the later addition of Irish-born bassist, Tiernan Welch, and guitarist, Spencer Lee, their line-up was finalised in September 2005. The name is taken from the inlay of Radiohead's second album, The Bends.DiScover: Public Relations Exercise Drowned in Sound; accessed 1 March 2007

==Press==

''Public Relations Exercise offer more immediate thrills with their highly-charged antics. A man by the name of Fats stands hunched over a microphone, spitting out words with a manic sense of urgency and desperation while intensely rhythmic guitars pound away at the cranium. Simultaneously catchy and chaotic, the Leicester bunch are quite simply a joy to behold.
Mike Kemp'' – Rock Sound
 Come you are safe, we are from the bombs is pretty much the record we'd all come to expect from an outfit as uncompromising and inventive as Public Relations Exercise, which only goes to show that the derelict dungeon of despair known as Leicester does have something to offer after all. 
 Leicester's Public Relations Exercise have been garnering a lot of positive press of late and it's not hard to see why. Their debut album is a healthy dose of alt-rock with a smigden of Slint mixed up with a healthy portion of Fugazi. Musically it's all over the place, discordant blues rock gone to hell and screamo with a posh accent, but above all it's absolutely incendiary. Where have these boys been hiding because it's time for them to take a bow. 
 A whirlwind of noise takes breaks for angular guitar work and singing...a triumph without compromise.
