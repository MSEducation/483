Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf is a Welsh-medium coeducational secondary school in Llandaff North, a district in the north of Cardiff, Wales and is the largest of its kind in the country. The name 'Glantaf' means 'The bank of the river Taf' in Welsh. Of the three Welsh-medium secondary schools serving Cardiff, it was the first to be established (the others being Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Plasmawr and Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bro Edern). Although all students speak Welsh and normally have received Welsh-language primary education, 68% (as of 2005) come from homes where Welsh is not the first language.2005 inspection

==History==

Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf was founded in 1978, initially sharing premises with the English-language Glantaf High School, before expanding to occupy the entire building. Its first Headmaster was Mr. J E Malcolm Thomas, who was succeeded upon his retirement in 1995 by Mr. Huw S Thomas, and then by Headmistress Mrs. Rhiannon Lloyd from Rhydywaun School. In early 2010, the Board of Governors announced that from September 2010 the former Head of Rhydywaun School would take over from Mrs Rhiannon Lloyd. From September 2010 Mr Alun Davies has taken over as Headmaster.Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf web site
Pupil numbers at the school increased into four figures during the mid-1980s, necessitating the annexing of the buildings of the old Waterhall School in Fairwater to form the Ysgol Isaf (Lower School), which housed the First and Second forms (later Years 7 and 8) of the school from 1986. This split-site arrangement continued until the opening of Cardiff's second Welsh-medium Comprehensive School, Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Plasmawr, in 1998, from which point the Llandaff North site again housed the entirety of Glantaf's pupils.

==Welsh-medium education==

Education in Wales differs in certain respects from the systems used elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf is a Welsh-medium school, which means that all lessons and all conversations within the school should take place in the Welsh language, and the speaking of English is frowned upon (though English lessons are taught mainly though the medium of English, where it is acceptable to speak the language).

==Ethos==

The school's motto is [tpl]lang|cy|Coron Gwlad Ei Mamiaith[/tpl], which translates to 'A Country's Crown is Her Mother Tongue'. The school colours are light and dark blue.

==Houses==

The school's four houses are named after Welsh saints: Dewi (house colour: yellow), Dyfrig (green), Illtud (red) and Teilo (blue). The four houses annually compete in the "GÅµyl Glantaf" (Glantaf Festival), in which there is a day of sports and a day of singing, playing instruments, reciting and numerous other events in the theme of the Eisteddfod.

==Results==
