[tpl]nihongo|Super Mario 64|スーパーマリオ64|Sūpā Mario Rokujūyon[/tpl] is a platform game, published by Nintendo and developed by its EAD division, for the Nintendo 64. Along with Pilotwings 64, it was one of the launch titles for the console.[tpl]cite web| url=http://gameinformer.com/News/Story/200609/N06.0915.1324.09291.htm| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061108055130/http://gameinformer.com/News/Story/200609/N06.0915.1324.09291.htm| archivedate=November 8, 2006| title= Will Wii Be Disappointed Again?|last=Berghammer|first=Billy| publisher=Game Informer| date=September 15, 2006| accessdate=October 22, 2006[/tpl] It was released in Japan on June 23, 1996, and later in North America, Europe, and Australia.

As one of the earlier three-dimensional (3D) platform games, Super Mario 64 is based on open world playability, degrees of freedom through all three axes in space, and relatively large areas which are composed primarily of true 3D polygons as opposed to only two-dimensional (2D) sprites.  The game established a new archetype for the 3D genre, much as Super Mario Bros. did for 2D sidescrolling platformers. In the evolution from two dimensions to three, Super Mario 64 places an emphasis on exploration within vast worlds that require the player to complete multiple diverse missions, in addition to the occasional linear obstacle courses as in traditional platform games. While doing so, it still preserves many gameplay elements and characters of earlier Mario games.
The game has left a lasting impression on 3D game design, particularly notable for its use of a dynamic camera system and the implementation of its 360-degree analog control.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3135350 |title = The Essential 50 Part 36: Super Mario 64 | publisher=1UP.com| accessdate=October 21, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermario64/review.html?|archiveurl= http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090307030507/http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermario64/review.html?|archivedate= 2009-03-07 |title=15 Most Influential Games of All Time | publisher=GameSpot| accessdate=July 3, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/091/091398p1.html | title=N64 Reader Tributes: Super Mario 64 | publisher=IGN| accessdate=October 21, 2006[/tpl] The title is acclaimed by many critics and fans as one of the greatest and most revolutionary video games of all time.[tpl]cite web| url=http://top100.ign.com/2003/1-10.html| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mqeaoEzJ| archivedate=2010-01-17| title=IGN's Top 100 Games| publisher=IGN| year=2003| accessdate=February 2, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://top100.ign.com/2005/001-010.html| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mqeao0AV| archivedate=2010-01-17| title=IGN's Top 100 Games| publisher=IGN| year=2005| accessdate=February 11, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_5.html| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65aWDgKEP| archivedate=2012-02-20| title=IGN's Top 100 Games of All Time| publisher=IGN| year=2007| accessdate=February 2, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| date= August 2001| title= Top 100 Games of All Time| journal= Game Informer| page= 36[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url = http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/specials/100games/1.html| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/65aWJH4fd| archivedate = 2012-02-20| title = The 100 Greatest Computer Games of All Time| publisher = Yahoo!

==Gameplay==

Super Mario 64 is a 3D platformer where the player controls Mario through several courses. Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask a favor (such as pink "peace-loving" Bob-omb Buddies). The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As more stars are collected, more areas of the castle hub world become accessible.[tpl]Cite journal| date= September 1996| title= Full Coverage — Super Mario 64| journal= Nintendo Power| publisher= Nintendo| issue= 88| pages= 14–23[/tpl] The player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses. There are many hidden mini-courses and other secrets to the game, most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely.
Some courses have special cap power-ups which augment Mario's abilities. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage, allows him to withstand wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage. Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bob-omb Buddy. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.
Mario's abilities in Super Mario 64 are far more diverse than those of previous Mario games. The player can make Mario walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, kick, or punch using the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the double and triple jumps (jumping two and three times in a row, respectively), long jump and backflip. There are also special maneuvers, such as wall jumping; jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach areas that would otherwise be too high. The player can pick up and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles, and swim underwater at various speeds. Mario's life energy slowly diminishes while underwater, representing how long he can hold his breath.

==Plot and setting==

Super Mario 64 is set in Princess Peach's Castle, which consists of three floors, a basement, a moat, and a courtyard. The area outside the castle is an introductory area in which the player can experiment, testing his or her player skills. Scattered throughout the castle are entrances to courses via secret walls and paintings. Super Mario 64 begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him.Princess Peach's note: "Dear Mario: Please come to the castle. I've baked a cake for you. Yours truly-- Princess Toadstool, Peach." [tpl]cite video game| title = Super Mario 64| developer = Nintendo EAD| publisher = Nintendo | date= September 29, 1996| platform= Nintendo 64[/tpl] However, when he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other worlds, in which Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more Power Stars, and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses, each leading to its own battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle, Peach is released from the stained-glass window above the castle's entrance. Peach rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.[tpl]cite book|year=1996|title=Official Super Mario 64 Player's Guide|publisher=Nintendo[/tpl][tpl]cite book| year=1996|title=Super Mario 64 Instruction Booklet| publisher=Nintendo| id=NUS-NSME-USA[/tpl]Princess Peach: "Mario!

==Development==

===Concept===

The development of Super Mario 64 took less than two years, but it was reported that producer and director Shigeru Miyamoto had conceived of a 3D Mario game concept over five years before, while working on Star Fox.[tpl]Cite journal| date= January 1996| title= The Game Guys – (Spaceworld 1995)| journal= Nintendo Power| publisher= Nintendo|issue= 80| url= http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=interviews&id=1996-01-np080-miya-tezu&m=html[/tpl] Also Argonaut Software's cancelled 3D platform game starring Yoshi that later became Croc: Legend of the Gobbos served as an inspiration for the game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-04-born-slippy-the-making-of-star-fox|title=Born slippy: the making of Star Fox|last=McFerran|first=Damien|date=4 July 2013|work=Eurogamer|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=4 July 2013[/tpl]
Miyamoto developed most of the concepts during the era of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and considered using the Super FX chip to make it an SNES game, but decided to develop it for the Nintendo 64 not due to the former system's technical limitations, but because the N64 controller had more buttons for use.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=223| title=Profile: Shigeru Miyamoto Chronicles of a Visionary| publisher=N-Sider| author=Grajqevci, Jeton| date=October 9, 2000| accessdate=December 5, 2007[/tpl] IGN said that Miyamoto had conceived of his idea as a proposed game called Super Mario FX.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.cheats.ign.com/objects/142/14217644.html |title=IGN: Super Mario FX |publisher=Uk.cheats.ign.com |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2011[/tpl] On his Twitter Dylan Cuthbert stated that there was never a Super Mario FX game ever in development, and that "Super Mario FX" was the internal code name of the FX chip."165596909413728256." (Archive) Twitter. Retrieved February 19, 2012. "SNES Central @dylancuthbert I'm researching unreleased SNES games, was a game called "Super Mario FX" ever in development? Dylan Cuthbert @snescentral no, that was the internal code name for the FX chip"

===Design===

The game's development began with the creation of the characters and camera system. Miyamoto and the other designers were initially unsure of which direction the game should take; months were spent selecting a camera view and layout that would be appropriate.[tpl]Cite journal| date= December 2001| title= The Making of Mario 64: Giles Goddard Interview| journal= NGC Magazine| publisher= Future Publishing|issue= 61[/tpl] The original concept involved the game having fixed path much like an isometric type game (similar to Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars), before the choice was made to settle on a free-roaming 3D design. Although the majority of Super Mario 64 would end up featuring the free-roaming design, elements of the original fixed path concept would remain in certain parts of the game, particularly in the three Bowser encounters. One of the programmers of Super Mario 64, Giles Goddard, explained that these few linear elements survived as a means to force players into Bowser's lair rather than to encourage exploration. The development team placed high priority on getting Mario's movements right, and before levels were created, the team was testing and refining Mario's animations on a simple grid. The first test scenario used to try out controls and physics involved Mario and a golden rabbit named "MIPS" by the developers (named for the MIPS-type CPU used by the Nintendo 64), the latter of which was included in the final release of the game as a means to obtain two of the Power Stars. The developers initially tried to make the game split screen co-op using both Mario and Luigi. Initially, the two characters would start at separate points in the castle and work their way through the game together. However, developers were unable to make the gameplay work.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/mario-64-once-had-a-co-op-mode-156090.phtml |title=Mario 64 once had a co-op mode |publisher=Destructoid |accessdate=August 30, 2011[/tpl]
One unique challenge that the team encountered early on was related to depth perception, which the team remedied by provisioning a shadow directly beneath each object regardless of the area's lighting.  Developer Yoshiaki Koizumi would go on to call this feature an "iron-clad necessity," adding, "It might not be realistic, but it’s much easier to play."[tpl]cite web|date=27 Nov 2007|title=MIGS 2007: Nintendo's Koizumi On The Path From Garden To Galaxy  |work=Gamasutra|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16386#.UERP19ZlRWw|accessdate=2 Sep 2012[/tpl]
Miyamoto's guiding design philosophy behind Super Mario 64 was to "include more details" than found in games prior to the Nintendo 64. Some details were inspired by real life. For example, the Boos are based on assistant director Takashi Tezuka's wife, who, as Miyamoto explained, "is very quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time Tezuka spent at work. In the game, there is now a character which shrinks when Mario looks at it, but when Mario turns away, it will grow large and menacing."[tpl]Cite journal| date= August 1995| title= Miyamoto Interview| journal= Nintendo Power| publisher= Nintendo|issue= 75| url= http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/0895.shtml[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] Super Mario 64 is also characterized by featuring more puzzles than earlier Mario games. It was developed simultaneously with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, but as Ocarina of Time was released more than two years later, some puzzles were taken from that game for Super Mario 64.[tpl]Cite journal| date= October 1996| title= Miyamoto Interview| journal= Nintendo Power| publisher= Nintendo| issue= 89| url= http://wayback.archive.org/web/20070220214126/http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/1096.shtml[/tpl]
Information about Super Mario 64 first leaked out in November 1995, and a playable version of the game was presented days later as part of the world premiere for the Nintendo 64 (then known as the "Ultra 64") at Nintendo Space World. The basic controls had at this point been implemented, and the game was reportedly 50% finished, although most of the course design remained. Thirty-two courses were created for the game. Miyamoto thought he would create more, up to 40 courses, not including bonus levels. The actual number turned out much lower in the final game, though, as only 15 courses could fit.

===Audio===

The music was composed by veteran composer Koji Kondo, who used new interpretations of the familiar melodies from earlier games as well as entirely new material. Super Mario 64 was one of the first games in the series to feature Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario. It also features the voices of Leslie Swan (then Senior Editor of Nintendo Power) as Princess Peach, who also wrote the English text for the game.[tpl]Cite journal| date= October 1996| title = Super Mario 64| journal= Nintendo Power| publisher= Nintendo| issue= 89| page= 67[/tpl]

Video game publications and developers praised Super Mario 64 for its design and use of the 3D gameplay. The game is counted by 1UP.com as one of the first games to have brought a series of 2D games into full 3D. In the transition to 3D, many of the series conventions were rethought drastically, placing an emphasis on exploration over traditional platform jumping, or "hop and bop" action. While its quality was disputed by some, it has been argued that it established an entirely new genre, different from that of previous games in the series.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3211627.stm | title=Platform video games evolve |publisher=BBC News | date=October 25, 2003 |accessdate=November 21, 2006[/tpl] Official Nintendo Magazine referred to the game as a "masterpiece of game design" and stated that Nintendo was able to take its "number-one 2D franchise and convert it flawlessly into 3D".[tpl]Cite journal| date= July 2006| title= What do you mean, you've never played...

He also praised the exploration aspect of the game, commenting that "players to explore the same spaces several times while revealing something new each time is a revelation".

==Impact and legacy==

Critics attribute the initial success of the Nintendo 64 console to Super Mario 64. Edge magazine referred to it as the Nintendo 64's "key launch title".[tpl]Cite journal| date= July 2007| title= Who Dares Wins| journal= Edge| publisher= Future Publishing|issue= 177|pages= 62–71[/tpl] Game Informer commented that the game helped the launch of the Nintendo 64.

A central hub, where controls can be learned before entering levels themselves, has been used in many 3D platformers since. In addition, the game's mission-based level design was an inspiration for other game designers. For example, Martin Hollis, who produced and directed GoldenEye 007, says "the idea for the huge variety of missions within a level came from Super Mario 64".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zoonami.com/briefing/2004-09-02.php | title=The Making of GoldenEye 007 | publisher=Zoonami| date=September 2, 2004 | accessdate=February 11, 2006[/tpl]
Super Mario 64 was the first game to have a "free" camera that could be controlled independently of the character. Most 3D games at the time used a first-person perspective, or a camera that was fixed in position relative to the player's character, or to the level. To create freedom of exploration, and more fluid control in a 3D world, the designers created a dynamic system in which the video camera was operated by the in-game character Lakitu. Nintendo Power stated the camera-control scheme was what transitioned platform games into the 3D era.[tpl]cite journal| title = Everything Old-School is New Again| issue = Winter Special 2008| journal = Nintendo Power| publisher = Future Publishing| date = Winter 2008| page = 42[/tpl] They would again cite Super Mario 64, along with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, as two games that "blazed trails" into the 3D era.[tpl]cite book |title=Nintendo Power 250th issue! |year=2010 |publisher=Future US |location=South San Francisco, California |page= 48 [/tpl] Edge stated the game changed "gamers' expectations of 3D movement forever". The camera system would become the standard for 3D platform games in the future. The Nintendo 64's analog stick allowed for more precise and wide-ranging character movements than the digital D-pads of other consoles, and Super Mario 64 used this in a way that was unique for its time. At the time, 3D games generally allowed for controls in which the player could either control the character in relation to a fixed camera angle or in relation to the character's perspective. Super Mario 64[tpl]'[/tpl]s controls were fully analog, and interpreted a 360-degree range of motion into navigation through a 3D space relative to the camera. The analog stick also allowed for precise control over subtleties such as the speed at which Mario runs. Super Mario 64 was of the first games to implement the system.[tpl]Cite journal| date= June 1996| title= N64 Exclusive| journal= Nintendo Power| publisher= Nintendo |issue= 85| pages= 16–17[/tpl]
Because of the game's popularity, rumors about glitches and secrets spread rapidly after its release. The most common rumor was that Luigi was a secret character in the game, fueled by illegible symbols in the castle courtyard that resembled the text "L is real 2401". This same texture would reappear in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on a plaque in Dodongo's Cavern. IGN received so many questions and supposed methods to unlock Luigi that the staff offered a US$100 reward to anyone who could prove that Luigi was in the game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060383p1.html | title = In Search of Luigi| publisher=IGN| author = IGN Staff| date = November 13, 1996| accessdate=October 11, 2007[/tpl] The number of false codes submitted to IGN dropped dramatically, as Luigi's inclusion was proved to be a myth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060392p1.html| title=Luigi Still Missing| publisher=IGN| author = IGN Staff| date = November 20, 1996| accessdate =October 11, 2007[/tpl] The April Fools' Day 1998 issue of Nintendo Power claimed that the cryptic phrase would be discussed on the non-existent page 128, and also featured a facetious article titled "Luigi 64", commenting humorously on the rumor.[tpl]Cite journal| date= April 1998| title= April News Briefs| journal= Nintendo Power| publisher= Nintendo| issue= 107| pages= 80–81[/tpl]
