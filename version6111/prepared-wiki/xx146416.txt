The FAI announced on 27 October 2007 the opening of the bidding for the 2009 Games. Turin (Italy) has been chosen to host the World Air Games 2009. The decision was announced by the President of FAI - the World Air Sports Federation, Pierre Portmann, on first of June 2007 at the Olympic Museum, Lausanne
