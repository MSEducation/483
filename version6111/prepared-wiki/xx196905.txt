The General Benjamin Lincoln House is a National Historic Landmark at 181 North Street in Hingham, Massachusetts, USA.  It was the birthplace and principal residence of Continental Army Major General Benjamin Lincoln (1733â€“1810), a well-respected military leader of the American Revolutionary War.  The house has portions that may date to the 1630s, with significant additions made principally during the 18th century.  The last major modifications to the house were probably undertaken by General Lincoln in the late 18th century.
The house remains, as of 2009, in the hands of Lincoln family descendants, and is not normally open to the public.  Changes to the interior and exterior are authorized only in consultation with Historic New England, a major regional historic preservation society.

==History of the house==

Like many early American houses, the Benjamin Lincoln House has gone through a number of phases, and the dates of work on the house are at times uncertain.  Family history places the initial construction of part of the house as early as 1637, by Thomas Lincoln "the cooper" (so designated to differentiate him from numerous other Thomas Lincolns who also settled in Hingham), although there is no visible architectural evidence to support this assertion.  What is certain is that circa 1715 the house acquired an L-shaped appearance, and was expanded by General Lincoln in the late 18th century to its present configuration.  A porch that was added in the late 19th century was removed in 1937, and represents the only significant alteration to the house since General Lincoln's time.
In 2009 Lincoln family descendants negotiated a preservation restriction agreement with Historic New England, a regional historic preservation society, to protect the interior and exterior character of the house.  Exterior changes to the property are also restricted by the house's presence as a contributing property to Hingham's Lincoln Historic District.[tpl]cite news|title=Preserving Hingham's Historic Benjamin Lincoln House|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/hingham/town_info/government/x1885888843/Preserving-Hinghams-historic-Benjamin-Lincoln-House|last=Britton Meyer|first=Carol|newspaper=Hingham Journal|date=July 11, 2009[/tpl]
