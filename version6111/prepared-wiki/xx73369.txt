[[Frisbee golf]]

#REDIRECT Disc golf

Players in North Eastern Ohio routinely call the game, which is played on unofficial courses, Frisbee Golf in an effort to distinguish it from the popular terminology. This is done mainly because of the strict use of Whamo brand Frisbees.  It is played with roughly the same rules as disc golf.
