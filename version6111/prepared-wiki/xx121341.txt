==History==

Ascoli (known as Asculum) was a city of the Dauni.[tpl]cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/442487 |title=Places: 442487 (Ausculum) |author=Edlund Berry, I., A. Small, DARMC, R. Talbert, S. Gillies, T. Elliott, J. Becker |accessdate=December 28, 2013  |publisher=Pleiades[/tpl] It was the site of two early Roman battles (see Battle of Asculum).Information about this war can be found in Plutarch's Lives (Pyrrus 2 1), Polybius, Dionysius of Halicarnassus (XX 1—3), and Livy. Later Sulla established a military colony there.
In the mid-9th century the Saracens razed the city. In 1040 it rebelled against the Byzantines and, the following year, a decisive battle was fought nearby which granted the Normans control over southern Italy.
