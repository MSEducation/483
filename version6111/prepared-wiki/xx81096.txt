==Henry Croft==

The practice of wearing clothes decorated with so-called pearl, actually mother-of-pearl buttons originated in the 19th century. It is first associated with Henry Croft, an orphan street sweeper who collected money for charity. At the time, London costermongers (street traders) were in the habit of wearing trousers decorated at the seams with pearl buttons that had been found by market traders. Croft adapted this to create a pearly suit to draw attention to himself and aid his fund-raising activities.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thepearlies.com/ | title=Original London Pearly Kings and Queens Association | accessdate=2009-09-24 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pearlysociety.co.uk/ | title=London Pearly Kings and Queens Society | accessdate=2009-09-24 [/tpl] In 1911 an organised pearly society was formed in Finchley, north London. 

===Death and memorial===

Croft died in January 1930 and his funeral was attended by 400 followers from all over London, receiving national media coverage.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=21943 | title=The Passing of the King of Pearly Kings | date=09/01/1930 | publisher=British Pathe | work=British Pathe Archive | accessdate=2009-09-24[/tpl] In 1934 a memorial was unveiled to him in St Pancras Cemetery and at a speech to mark the occasion he was said to have raised Â£5,000 for those suffering in London's hospitals.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=5235 | title=Memorial to "Pearly King" | date=04/06/1934 | publisher=British Pathe | work=British Pathe Archive | accessdate=2009-09-24[/tpl] The statue was later moved to the crypt of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster.

==Pearly organisations==

The pearlies are now divided into several active groups. Croft's founding organisation is called the Original London Pearly Kings and Queens Association. It was reformed in 1975[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thepearlies.co.uk/ | title=Original London Pearly Kings and Queens Association | accessdate=2009-09-24 [/tpl] and holds the majority of the original pearly titles which are City of London, Westminster, Victoria, Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Shoreditch, Islington, Dalston and Hoxton.  Other groups have also been established over the years. The oldest is the Pearly Guild, which began in 1902;[tpl] cite web | url=http://www.cockneymuseum.u-net.com/ | title=Pearly Guild | accessdate=2009-09-24 [/tpl] modern additions include the London Pearly Kings and Queens Society which started in 2001 following a disagreement,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pearlysociety.co.uk/ | title=London Pearly Kings and Queens Society | accessdate=2009-09-24 [/tpl] another is the Pearly Kings and Queens Guild.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pearlykingsandqueens.com/history/|title=Pearly Kings and Queens Guild|accessdate=7 May 2012[/tpl] Despite the rivalries, each group is associated with a church in central London and is committed to raising money for London-based charities. A parade of real-life Pearly Kings and Queens was featured at the 2012 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony.
