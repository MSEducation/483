Chthon is a fictional character, a demonic Elder God in the Marvel Comics Universe. His name derives from chthon, the Greek word for "earth" and "earthly", especially pertaining to earth that was not life giving soil, but dark like that of the grave or the underworld. In some instances, Chthon is portrayed as the Marvel equivalent of the primal Devil of some kind predating that of Judeo-Christian teachings, as his creations, the N'Garai, were driven from Earth by the angel Lucifer before his rebellion against God.Marvel Preview #7

==Fictional character biography==

===Ancient history===

During the era in which the first single-celled organism formed on Earth, the Elder God Demiurge achieved consciousness after being formed and coalesced from the Earth's biosphere. As conditions on Earth began to support life, it became aware. Wanting to know itself, the Demiurge split itself into countless aspects, one of which evidently became Chthon. Consequently, Chthon is billions of years old.
The Elder Gods are the forerunners to the modern gods and demons of Earth. Other contemporary demons that would become known as the "Elder Gods" as well are Set and Belathauzer. Gaea came into being and was the "Protector of the Emerging Life" that began in the Seas. Oshtur, sister to Gaea and the other Elder Gods, left Earth in search of the mysteries of the universe. Chthon began devoting itself to the study and manipulation of mystical energies, becoming Earth's first master of black magic, even experimenting on his fellow gods.
Set, the "God of the Dead", spawned a number of offspring (e.g., "Sligguth" and "Damballah"). Realizing he could increase his own power by consuming the energy of his fellow demons, Set became the first being on Earth to kill another. By consuming the life energies of a fellow Elder God, Set started down the path to degeneracy. Other Elder Gods quickly began following Set's example, killing each other for more power. The more they consumed, the more they hungered for power. With more power, the hunger became insatiable. Many became corrupt and began warring to satisfy the thirst for power; the victor feeding off the other. After millions of years, all the Elder Gods, except for Gaea and Oshtur, had degenerated to less than their Godhood, becoming evil.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
As the Elder Gods degenerated into violence, only Gaea remained peaceful. Seeking a way to protect the innocent life that was growing on the planet, Gaea mated with the Demiurge creating Atum, the first of a new generation of gods that would protect the world from the "Demonic Elder Gods".[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
Chthon (as well as many of the Elder Gods) had the talent of foresight. As the threat of Gaea's offspring came to light, he inscribed all his dark mystical knowledge (acquired through millennia of practicing evil incarnate) onto indestructible parchments to leave in this dimension (should he be defeated) as a testament to his power and a link between him and this world.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
Atum indeed became a threat to the Elder Gods, as he began destroying them for their evil and degradation, absorbing their energies into himself. The demonic energies he absorbed made him more and more powerful and caused Atum to undergo a metamorphosis into the form of Demogorge the God-Eater. Many of the Elder Gods fell to Atum, and those who were not destroyed fled to other dimensions.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
Chthon and Set joined together to fight Atum, but were defeated. Chthon, sensing the end was near, cast a spell that allowed him an escape into another dimension before the Demogorge could slay him.Thor Annual #10 Before he left, Chthon left the parchment he had written behind, serving as a touchstone.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
Upon learning what her siblings had degenerated into, Oshtur volunteered to leave the Earth dimension to prevent Gaea's spell from being weakened. After the demon-war, Gaea was the only original Elder God permitted to exist on the planet, and she infused her godly essence into the Earth and into all living things (becoming known as "Mother Earth"). The Demogorge released the energies he had absorbed, reverting to the form of Atum. He then took residence within Earth's Sun. Atum returned to the Earth sometime later when Set threatened to invade the Earth with the rise of the dinosaurs. The struggle between Set and Atum was so great, that many believe the energy released during that period was responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs. After that battle, Atum would father the Egyptian pantheon of gods and later return to Earth when he assisted the "Odinson" Thor, with whom Atum shared his maternal parent, Gaea. Together, Atum and Thor engaged and defeated the Elder God Set.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
Chthon added the Demogorge page to the scrolls to ensure that any future Demogorge on Earth would be at his own behest. He also added a counter-spell to stop the Demogorge that could only be cast by someone non-mystical in nature. The parchments would one day be bound together in a single volume and aptly titled, the Darkhold, the Earth's first tome of black magic. In his new dimension, Chthon spawned the race of demons known as the N'Garai, who would return to Earth though he himself could not.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
The Darkhold was discovered by human sorcerers in pre-Cataclysmic Atlantis. These sorcerers (including Varnae) founded a cult of Darkholders and used the power of Chthon to become vampires in a bid to attain immortality. Over the next millennia, many people came to use the Darkhold and were corrupted by Chthon.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
In the Sixth Century, the sorceress Morgan le Fey became leader of the Darkholders. Morgan and the Darkholders attempted to summon the Elder God to make him do their bidding, not knowing that a demon of his power and consciousness is uncontrollable by Earth's standards. When the Darkholders tried to send the demon "back to whence he came," they discovered they were incapable of banishing him altogether, and so they bound him (with the aid of the text itself) to a single Earthly location, Mount Wundagore, in what would become the Eastern European nation of Transia.Avengers #187

===Modern times===

In the late 1940s, Herbert Wyndham, the man who became the High Evolutionary, made his laboratory base at the foot of Wundagore Mountain with the assistance of Doctor Horace Grayson (the father of the 1950s superhero Marvel Boy).Avengers #187
In the 1950s, a young Philip Masters (the Puppet Master) obtained clay from the mountain that had been granted mystical power by Chthon's presence. He would use this clay in his attempts to conquer the Fantastic Four.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
A colleague of Herbert Wyndham's, Jonathan Drew, with his wife Miriam and daughter Jessica, arrived during this time. The werewolf Gregor Russoff, a Darkholder whose grandson (birthname Jacob Russoff, legal name Jack Russell) would become the Werewolf by Night, attacked and killed Drew's wife. Jonathan Drew was possessed by the ghost of the magician Magnus, who had fought the Darkholders for centuries. Wyndham, to protect the Drews' daughter, put her in suspended animation.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
The High Evolutionary also created a race of artificially evolved humanoid animals called the New Men. He was convinced by Magnus (in Jonathan Drew's form) to pattern their codes of action and conduct after medieval knighthood. They named the elite members of the New Men the Knights of Wundagore.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
During this period, a pregnant gypsy woman named Magda arrived at Wundagore, on the verge of giving birth. Unknown to all, she was the wife of the man who would become Magneto.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
Centuries later, Chthon's evil infected the young Jessica Drew, who was raised in a lab on Wundagore.Spider-Woman #44 He was summoned to battle the High Evolutionary by the werewolf Gregor Russoff, resulting in Russoff's death.Doctor Strange (vol. 3) #27 Immediately after this defeat, Chthon planted a part of his essence in another child raised beneath Wundagore, Wanda Maximoff.
As his presence faded, Chthon sent a part of his essence into one of Magda's twin children, Wanda, whose mutation was transformed into the ability to manipulate chaos and probability and, later, to manipulate reality itself. Magda died and her children were placed into suspended animation.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
Several years later, Robert Frank and his pregnant wife Madeline (formerly the superheroes Whizzer and Miss America) came to Wundagore. Madeline died giving birth to a stillborn child that was deformed by the Franks' exposure to radiation at the hands of their enemy Isbisa. When Robert asked to see his child, Lady Bova, knowing that his wife had died in child birth and to spare his grief, presented the two children (born to the late Magda) to him as his children, but when he learned of his wife's death, he fled. He would for years believe that the twins were his own abandoned children, although the Franks also had one surviving son, Nuklo, who was in suspended animation in the care of the United States government.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
The infant twins were returned to suspended animation for decades until Bova brought them to a Transian gypsy named Django Maximoff, who raised the children as his own. While the twins would become the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, Jessica Drew was also freed from suspended animation, eventually becoming the first Spider-Woman.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
Chthon's influence amplified some years later thanks to a proliferation of Darkholders across the planet. Vittorio Montesi discovered he was sterile, but was determined to have an heir to guard the Darkhold that had come into his possession. Montesi gave in to temptation and used a Spell of Fertility from the cursed book. This allowed Montesi's wife to become pregnant; not with Vittorio's child, but rather Chthon's demon-spawn. The child was Victoria Montesi who would grow to lead a group of mystic investigators including Modred the Mystic, opposing the users of the Darkhold powers and incantations. Chthon mystically impregnated Victoria with his own life-force in an attempt to be reborn on Earth, but this was prevented by Doctor Strange.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
In the modern era, Modred the Mystic and Magnus opposed the Darkholders and Morgan le Fey, respectively; with Magnus also becoming an ally of Spider-Woman.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
When Modred the Mystic transcended into loyalty to Chthon, the Elder God had him delude Magnus into absence when he was to rise again. Modred captured the Scarlet Witch and performed the ritual allowing the Chthon to use her as his vessel on Earth. While trying to purge the form of the last of Wanda's humanity and conscience, Chthon appeared before Lady Bova and Wanda's brother, Pietro, warning them to leave or be killed. As Chthon began to grow more powerful in Wanda's earthly form, she attacked Pietro and their adoptive father, Django Maximoff.[tpl]Issue|date=May 2011[/tpl]
Decades later, Chthon managed to fully turn Mordred the Mystic into his servant, and sent him to capture Maximoff (who had since become the Scarlet Witch) for use as his Earthly host. However, the Avengers freed Maximoff from his control.Avengers #185-187
Chthon returned for revenge and possessed Quicksilver to attack the Avengers, but was defeated again.Mighty Avengers #21-23 He attempted to turn his other Wundagore child, Jessica Drew, into one of his demons, but was thwarted when his human puppet for the task, Viper, betrayed him.
During the Fear Itself storyline, Chthon attended the Devil's Advocate to talk about the Serpent's actions on Earth.Journey Into Mystery #627
