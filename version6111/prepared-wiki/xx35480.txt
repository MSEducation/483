==Features==

The Port Campbell National Park is a protected national park in Victoria, Australia, 190 kilometres south-west of Melbourne; featuring an array of sheer cliffs overlooking offshore islets, rock stacks, gorges, arches, and blow-holes. As part of the Shipwreck Coast,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/22/1037697863828.html|title=A vision splendid|date=23 November 2002|accessdate=17 June 2010|publisher=John Fairfax Holdings|work=www.smh.com.au[/tpl] it hosts several tourist attractions; including The Twelve Apostles, the London Arch (formerly London Bridge), Loch Ard Gorge, the Gibson Steps, and The Grotto.
The park is subject to salt-laden air, and the cliff-tops are particularly exposed to the harsh weather conditions from the Southern Ocean. However, fragile grasslands and heath-lands are still able to develop, supporting plant species such as sun orchid and spider orchid[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]. In protected areas, plant life includes beard-heath, bower spinach, coast daisy bush[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl], daisies and cushion bush. The wilder terrain hosts an assortment of she-oaks, dogwoods, correa, messmate, trailing guinea-flower, woolly tea-tree and scented paperbark.
The fauna in the park is largely ornithological; and includes honeyeaters, southern emu and fairy wrens, swamp harriers, rufous bristlebird, peregrine falcons, pelicans, ducks, black swans and egrets. Penguins, terns and dotterels are located along the shoreline, with hooded plovers nesting in exposed locations. Australasian gannets, wandering albatrosses and short-tailed shearwaters live out at sea. Land animals in the park include southern brown bandicoot, swamp antechinuse and echidna.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-factsheet/port-campbell--places-to-see-20081120-6c0u.html|title=Port Campbell - Places to See|accessdate=17 June 2010|publisher=Fairfax Media|work=The Age[/tpl]

==History==

The Port Campbell National Park was dedicated in 1964 (with 700 hectares) in order to protect the limestone formations on and near the coastline adjacent to the Great Ocean Road. By 1981 the park had grown to 1,750 hectares; extending from the eastern side of Curdies Inlet at Peterborough to Point Ronald at Princetown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/victoria/port-campbell/2005/02/17/1108500207192.html|title=Port Campbell|date=8 February 2004|accessdate=27 May 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Digital[/tpl] In 2002, the Port Campbell Professional Fishermen's Association unsuccessfully attempted to block the creation of a proposed marine national park at the Twelve Apostles location,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200204/s531471.htm|title=Port Campbell bid to block marine national park|accessdate=17 June 2010|date=15 April 2002|work=www.abc.net.au|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation[/tpl] but were satisfied with the later Victorian Government decision to not allow seismic exploration at the same site by Benaris Energy;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200310/s969092.htm|title=Fishermen welcome decision against national park seismic exploration|accessdate=17 June 2010|date=17 October 2003|work=www.abc.net.au|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation[/tpl] believing it would harm marine life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200310/s971651.htm|title=Otway Basin seismic survey work set to start|accessdate=17 June 2010|date=21 October 2003|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|work=www.abc.net.au[/tpl]
