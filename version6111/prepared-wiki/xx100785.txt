[[Electronic voting in Canada]]

CATEGORIES: Elections in Canada, Electronic voting by country

It is a common misconception that there is no electronic voting in Canada.  While the federal elections still use paper ballots, electronic voting technology has been used since at least the 1990s at the municipal level in some cities, and there are increasing efforts in a few areas to introduce it at a provincial level.  Some municipalities provide Internet voting as an option.
There are no Canadian electronic voting standards.

==Federal==

For national elections, there is a uniform set of standards for voting.
This governing law is the Canada Elections Act.
As of this writing, the Act is c. 9, assented to (made law) 31 May 2000.
It has a provision
PART 2 CHIEF ELECTORAL OFFICER AND STAFF
Electronic voting process
18.1 The Chief Electoral Officer may carry out studies on voting, including studies respecting alternative voting means, and may devise and test an electronic voting process for future use in a general election or a by-election. Such a process may not be used for an official vote without the prior approval of the committees of the Senate and of the House of Commons that normally consider electoral matters.
