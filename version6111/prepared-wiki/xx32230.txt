Grenzschutzgruppe 9 der Bundespolizei (Border Protection Group 9 of the Federal Police), commonly abbreviated GSG 9 is a German counter-terrorism and special operations unit.

==Origins==

On September 5, 1972, the Palestinian terrorist movement Black September infiltrated the Summer Olympic Games in Munich, West Germany, to kidnap 11 Israeli athletes, killing 2 in the Olympic Village in the initial assault on the athletes' rooms. The incident culminated when German police, neither trained nor equipped for counter-terrorism operations, and underestimating the number of terrorists involved, attempted to rescue the athletes. They failed and the operation led to the deaths of one policeman, five of the eight kidnappers and all of the remaining nine hostages (subsequently called the Munich massacre). Apart from the human tragedy, Germany's law enforcement found itself severely compromised, in part due to its historic relationship to Jews and Israel.

==History and name==

As a consequence of the mismanagement of the Olympic tragedy, the West German government created the GSG 9 under the leadership of then Oberstleutnant Ulrich Wegener so that similar situations in the future could be responded to adequately and professionally. Many German politicians opposed its formation, fearing GSG 9 would rekindle memories of the Nazi Party's Schutzstaffel (SS). The decision was taken to form the unit from police forces as opposed to the military as is the model in other countries on the grounds that German federal law expressly forbids the use of the military forces against the civilian population. Special forces composed of police personnel would reconcile this. The unit was officially established on April 17, 1973 as a part of Germany's federal police agency, the Bundesgrenzschutz (Federal Border Guard Service, renamed Bundespolizei or Federal Police in 2005). The name GSG 9 stood for Grenzschutzgruppe 9 (Border Guard Group 9) and was chosen simply because the BGS had eight regular border guard groups at the time. After the 2005 renaming, the abbreviation "GSG 9" was kept due to the fame of the unit and is now the official way to refer to the unit. Its formation was based on the expertise of the Israeli Sayeret Matkal.

==Operations==

GSG 9 is deployed in cases of hostage taking, kidnapping, terrorism and extortion. The group may also be used to secure locations, neutralize targets, track down fugitives and sometimes conduct sniper operations. The unit is very active in developing and testing methods and tactics for these missions. Finally, the group may provide advice to the different Länder, ministries and international allies. The group assists the Bundespolizei and other federal and local agencies on request. At the time of the 1977 Mogadishu mission, the Commander of the Israeli Border Police Tzvi War described GSG 9 as "The best anti-terrorist group in the world."
From 1972 to 2003 they reportedly completed over 1,500 missions,Federal Police, Duties and Organisation[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl], page 17. discharging their weapons on only five occasions. At the SWAT World Challenge in 2005, GSG 9 won an impressive eight out of eight events, beating 17 other teams. GSG 9 defended its championship the following year,History of The Original SWAT WORLD Challenge[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] "Team GSG-9, the Federal Border Police of Germany, swept the competition and won all seven events." and placed fifth in 2007.http://www.swatseries.com/html/Result2007.php[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Germany offered to render assistance to India in the wake of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. GSG 9 helped train and upgrade the National Security Guards, the primary Indian counter-terrorism unit.[tpl]cite web |title=Elite German police wing to train NSG |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/elite-german-police-wing-to-train-nsg/400650/ |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2011-01-25 |publisher=Indian Express[/tpl] Further help was provided to the Mumbai Police so that they could raise a SWAT team.[tpl]cite web |last=Samanta |first=Pranab Dhal |title=German counter-terror force to help set up Mumbai SWAT team |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/german-counterterror-force-to-help-set-up-mumbai-swat-team/440320/ |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2011-01-25 |publisher=Indian Express[/tpl]

==Missions==

Its first mission, "Operation Feuerzauber" (Operation Fire Magic), immediately established the GSG 9's reputation as an elite unit. It was carried out in 1977 when Palestinian terrorists hijacked the Landshut, a Lufthansa plane on the way from Palma de Mallorca to Frankfurt, demanding that imprisoned members of the German Red Army Faction terrorist group be freed in exchange for the passengers and crew who would be held as hostages. The aircraft was then flown to several destinations throughout the Middle East.  During this time, the Lufthansa captain Jürgen Schumann was murdered by the leader of the hijackers in Aden.
Following a four-day odyssey, the hijackers directed the Boeing 737 to Mogadishu, Somalia, where they waited for the arrival of the Red Army Faction members after the German government had (falsely) signaled they would be released. In the night between October 17 and October 18, Somalian ranger units created a distraction, while members of the GSG 9 stormed the plane.Interview with Ulrich Wegener, Welt Online, 13. Oktober 2007 retrieved on 12-01-2008
The operation lasted seven minutes and was successful with all of the hostages rescued. Three hijackers died, the fourth was seriously injured. Only one GSG9 member and one flight attendant were injured.  The international counter-terrorism community applauded the GSG9 for the excellent and professional handling of the situation as assaults on planes are considered to be one of the most difficult operations that a hostage rescue force is likely to encounter. To support the GSG9 action, two accompanying SAS advisers provided some newly developed flash bang grenades, but ultimately, the flash bangs were never used due to the fire risk inside the aircraft cabin.

===Publicly known missions===

Note: The majority of this unit's missions are confidential and public information is not available. Since its inception, GSG 9 has participated in over 1500 missions, yet reportedly fired shots only on five occasions (official count, prior to the 2003 Iraq War). These occasions were Mogadishu in 1977, Bad Kleinen in 1993, Aachen in 1999 and two more missions where firearms were used to shoot dogs of the persons being arrested.

==Organization==

The unit forms part of the German Bundespolizei (Federal Police, formerly Bundesgrenzschutz), and thus has normal police powers, including, for example, the power of arrest. The Federal Police of Germany (and thus the GSG 9) is under the control of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. The Bundespolizei also provides aerial transportation for the GSG 9. In contrast, regular police forces are subordinate to the various States or Länder, as are their Spezialeinsatzkommando (SEK) teams, while the military is responsible for the Kommando Spezialkräfte (KSK) (Special Forces command) and the Kampfschwimmer.
The GSG 9 is based in Sankt Augustin-Hangelar near Bonn and is currently under the command of Olaf Lindner. Previous commanders were Ulrich Wegener, Uwe Dee, Jürgen Bischoff and Friedrich Eichele. GSG9 consists of three main sub-groups, plus a number of support groups:

==Recruitment and Training==

Members of the Bundespolizei and other German police services with at least two years of service can apply for the selection process of the GSG 9.

The subsequent 22-week training period includes thirteen weeks of basic training and nine weeks of specialized training.GSG 9 der Bundespolizei: Informationbrochure Die GSG 9 der Bundespolizei sucht Nachwuchs! (Stand: 28. Juni 2007). out ob June 19, 2010 by the Federal Police of Germany on an information day at the Federal Criminal Police Officehttp://www.gsg9.de/GSG9_Flyer.pdf
The identity of GSG 9 members is classified as top secret. Further training often involves co-operation with other allied counter-terrorism units, i.e. Israel's Yamam.http://www.bundespolizei.de/DE/06Die-Bundespolizei/Organisation/BPOLP/GSG9/Berichte/40-jahre-gsg9.html Only one in five pass the training course.
