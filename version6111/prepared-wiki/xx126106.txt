Vladimir Nevezhin ([tpl]lang-ru|Владимир Александрович Невежин[/tpl]) is a Russian historian (Doctor of History Sciences), is working as a professor in Moscow, chief scientific collaborator at the Institute of Russian History (of the Russian Academy of Science) and member of the editorial board of the journal Отечественная история (History of the Fatherland). 
During the 1990s, he took part in the discussion and dispute over the pre-history of the Great Patriotic War. Nevezhin has analysed the content of Stalin's speeches, propagandistic directives in spring 1941 and notes of the contemporaries, drawing conclusions that the numerous documents unambiguously expressed the preparations of the country for an offensive in 1941.
