==Research==

Lyons’ early research focuses on currency markets, a focus reflected in his recent book “The Microstructure Approach to Exchange Rates” (MIT Press).The Microstructure Approach to Exchange Rates at MIT Press (http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=10838) This novel approach to exchange rates examines the market from a trading-room perspective, e.g., the flow of buy and sell orders and why those orders subsequently affect prices, rather than from the traditional perspective of macroeconomics. This line of work focuses on how dispersed information gets reflected in prices via trading. He has published numerous articles on these and other related topics. Recently, his research has taken a quite different tack, namely, exploring the links between leadership and innovation in organizations.
