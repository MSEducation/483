[[End-of-life (product)]]

CATEGORIES: Consumer theory, Products, Software release

"End-of-life" (EOL) is a term used with respect to a product supplied to customers, indicating that the product is in the end of its useful life (from the vendor's point-of-view), and a vendor intends to stop marketing, selling, or sustaining it. (The vendor may simply intend to limit or end support for the product.) In the specific case of product sales, a vendor may employ the more specific term "end-of-sale" (EOS).  The time-frame after the last production date depends on the product and relates to the expected product lifetime from a customer's point-of-view.  Different lifetime examples include toys from fast food chains (weeks or months), cars (10 years), and mobile phones (3 years).

==Product support==

Product support during EOL varies by product. For hardware with an expected lifetime of 10 years after production ends, the support includes spare parts, technical support and service. Spare-part lifetimes are price-driven due to increasing production costs: when the parts can no longer be supplied through a high-volume production site (often closed when series production ends), the cost increases.

==Computing==

In the computing field, the concept of end-of-life has significance in the production, supportability and purchase of software and hardware products. For example, Microsoft marked Windows 98 for end-of-life on June 30, 2006. Its software produced after that date, such as Office 2007 (released November 30, 2006), is not supported on Windows 98 or any prior versions. Depending on vendor, end-of-life may differ from end of service life, which has the added distinction that a vendor of systems or software will no longer provide maintenance, troubleshooting or other support.
