Lake Alpine is a reservoir in Alpine County, California, formed by Alpine Dam on Silver Creek.  It is located east of Bear Valley in the Sierra Nevada range. It sits at 7,303 feet (2,227 m) above mean sea level and is a popular spot for outdoor activities, such as boating and hiking in the summer, and snowmobiling and skiing in the winter, although it may be inaccessible at times due to snow.
California State Route 4 passes to the north of Lake Alpine between Bear Valley and the Pacific Grade Summit.
