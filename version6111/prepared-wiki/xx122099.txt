The Push–pull connector was invented by Swiss connectors manufacturer LEMO and is a type of cable interconnect that provides a strong locking mechanism that is only released by squeezing the connector body, preventing accidental disconnects. The connector is cylindrical, enabling a wide range of body styles and configurations such as low or high voltage multipin, coaxial, triaxial, fluid and gas.
Fischer Connectors and Lemo are well-known Swiss manufacturing company that are leaders in developing and manufacturing broad range of circular push-pull connectors.
