Thought to be Lake County's oldest settlement, New Pine Creek was originally to be named Pine Creek after a nearby stream. However, since another community was already using that name, postal authorities preferred an alternative. The New Pine Creek post office opened in 1876. S. A. Hamersley was the first postmaster.[tpl]cite book|last=McArthur|first=Lewis A.|authorlink=Lewis A. McArthur|coauthors=Lewis L.
