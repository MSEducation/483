Four singles have been released from the album: "Gekommen um zu bleiben" (28 February 2005), "Nur ein Wort" (17 May 2005), "Von hier an blind" (26 September 2005) and "Wenn es passiert" (13 January 2006).
The CD's enhanced CD section features a couple of short videos from the production of the album.
Following the album's success in Germany and Austria, Wir sind Helden recorded several songs from the album in English, French and Japanese, for possible releases in non-German-speaking countries.[tpl]ref|Spiegel[/tpl] "Sā Itte Miyō", a Japanese version of "Von hier an blind", was released as a B-side on the "Von hier an blind" single.
The entire artwork (cover, booklet, etc.) for the album as well as for the singles was designed by Berlin illustrator Vanessa Karr. It was modeled after parts from the comic book Tintin in Tibet (1960) by Belgian artist Hergé who died in 1983. Notably, the video for the album's title single "Von hier an blind" is in the same style.
