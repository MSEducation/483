Langmeier Software is privately held, software developer based in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. The company was founded 2004 by Urs Langmeier and develops applications and software utilities for home and business use. Its main product is Langmeier Backup.
2006 the company released a second product, called Testingpoint, which was usueful for monitoring websites and servers. In the year 2007 the company started to sell a couple of other software products for various topics, Anti-Spam software, a game and a software to help submitting information to web archives. All of the software Urs Langmeier produced personally in Switzerland, except Testingpoint, which was developed mainly in Ukraine by developers of the Guriansoft Ukraine Ltd company. Though the main focus of the company was always on the backup program, for which Langmeier Software used most of its marketing and programming budget. The focussing was also visible on the quality of the products. People said, that other products were looking a bit half-baked.
In consideration of the Pareto principle, which says that a company may have 80% of return for products which need 20% of the effort, and products, where this proportion is vice-versa, the company decided to specialise in backup tools, and sold off at 2 June 2008 his part of the rights from the Testingpoint software, from which the company held before 50% of the rights together with an individual.
In the spring of 2008, the company released a USB stick with data backup functionality, called "the Langmeier Backup USB-Stick". The pressrelease about the release of this USB stick was published in summer 2008, and got a huge amount of attention in public media. Many newspapers mentioned the gadget directly beside the Apple Inc. iPhone. Two radio transmitters spoke about the gadget.
