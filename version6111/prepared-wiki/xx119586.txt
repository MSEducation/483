==Career==

In 1996, signed to MCA Records, her debut single, "You Lift Me Up" was released and was well reviewed, and a large national club hit in the UK. The single also reached the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart.
The follow-up, "Just A Little Bit Of Love" was not so well received by critics.  Of note, Smash Hits magazine, reviewing the single, declared that Rebekah may be as cute as a box of Andrex puppies, but even that shouldn't help this duffer of a dance single into the charts.  Nevertheless, it was a moderate club success, and like its predecessor, was produced by the popular dance outfit, K-Klass.  However, the single failed to reach the Top 40, peaking at #51 in the UK.  Celine Dion also sung the song.
Early in 1997, "Woman in Love" was released to mixed reviews. It was a cover version of the Barbra Streisand hit.  "Woman in Love" was essentially a ballad with hip hop and R&B undertones.  The track did not sell well, entering the chart at #64 and disappearing from the chart the following week.  Ryan did have an album in the pipeline and it was due for release in mid-1997.  However, it was decided not to release it, due to Ryan's previous two singles failing to emulate the success of her debut.
In 2001, with a new recording contract, Ryan re-emerged with a totally different sound, style and image. Whereras before, her material had been dance-pop/soul, it was now rock-pop. Her album, Big Trouble (Lots of Fun) was released by Jive Records, despite the non-presence of a hit single to 'promote' it.  The album sold poorly.  However, many respected journals praised the record[tpl]who|date=June 2009[/tpl] and compared Ryan to Alanis Morissette.  The lead single, "You Think You Got The Right" benefited from good reviews and promotion, but did not reach the UK Singles Chart.  In 2002, still on Jive Records, Ryan released a re-edited version of the album, this time entitled I'll Live, and featuring another new single, "Can I Depend On You?"; neither release charted.  The album, complete with new artwork, also omitted a few of the prior LP's tracks, yet added some more ones.
In 2007, Ryan was selected as one of the 12 finalists in the 'over 25's' group on the ITV talent show, The X Factor.
