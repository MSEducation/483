==Toponymy and composition==

The name of the United States East Coast derives from the idea of the United States as having two distinct coastlines, one at its west and one at its east. Other terms to refer to this area by cardinal direction include the term Eastern Seaboard and simply East Coast. The region is also commonly referred to as the Atlantic Coast or Atlantic Seaboard due to the coastline being against the Atlantic Ocean.[tpl]Cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
