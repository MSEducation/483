The Montreal Sasquatch were a team of the Premier Basketball League (PBL) that played in the 2008–09 season under two different ownership groups.

==History==

Réal Bourassa was granted an expansion franchise in the PBL for the 2009 season.  However, on February 5, 2009, the PBL canceled the franchise after it emerged that players weren't being paid.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3773597 | title = PBL Makes Decision to Remove Montreal | date = 2009-02-05 | accessdate = 2009-02-05 | publisher = Our Sports Central[/tpl] A dispersal draft of Sasquatch players was then conducted.
On February 11, the PBL announced that Soar Enterprises, another ownership group, would take over the franchise and play the remainder of the season.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3776338 | title = Premier Basketball League Continues in Montreal this Season | publisher = Our Sports Central | date = 2009-02-11 | accessdate = 2009-02-12[/tpl]  The squad was to be known as Team Montreal as Bourassa retained the rights to the name Sasquatch.
The Sasquatch were one of four teams in the PBL Atlantic Division that enhanced their 20-game PBL schedule with 6 exhibitions to compete for the "Champlain Cup."  When the Sasquatch were removed from the league, the other teams decided that the remaining, unplayed exhibitions involving the Sasquatch would be treated as forfeits.
The PBL, which arranged all league travel, intervened heavily to ensure that the next three road games took place.  However, the venue arranged for the reconstituted team's first home game, on February 27, fell through; the visiting Halifax Rainmen objected to an alternate gym[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.thechronicleherald.ca | title = Rainmen object to gym, Montreal game cancelled | publisher = The Chronicle-Herald | date = 2009-03-01 | accessdate = 2009-03-01[/tpl] and the PBL ruled that it did not meet league standards.  A home game against Wilmington the next day was likewise cancelled,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3783696 | title = Premier Basketball League Montreal Statement | publisher = Our Sports Central | date = 2009-02-28 | accessdate = 2009-02-28[/tpl] and the remaining home games were played at the opponent's venue.
