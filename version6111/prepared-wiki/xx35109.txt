Yellowknife [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɛ|l|oʊ|n|aɪ|f[/tpl] (2011 population:
19,234) is the capital city and largest community of the Northwest Territories (NT or NWT), Canada. It is located on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, approximately [tpl]convert|400|km|abbr=on[/tpl] south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of Yellowknife Bay near the outlet of the Yellowknife River. Yellowknife and its surrounding water bodies were named after a local Dene tribe once known as the 'Copper Indians' or 'Yellowknife Indians' (now referred to locally as the Yellowknives Dene (First Nation)) who traded tools made from copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. The current population is ethnically mixed. Of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are spoken in significant numbers in Yellowknife: Dene Suline, Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. In the Dogrib language, the city is known as Somba K’e (Som-ba Kay) ("where the money is").
The Yellowknife settlement is considered to have been founded in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although the first evidence of a community with commerce did not emerge until 1936. Yellowknife soon became the centre of economic activity in the NWT, and became the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane, Yellowknife shifted from being a mining town to being a centre of government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of diamonds north of Yellowknife in 1991, this shift has begun to reverse.

==History==

Traditionally, First Nations people of Yellowknives Dene culture had occupied this region; by the 1930s they had a settlement on a point of land on the east side of Yellowknife Bay, Dettah. The current municipal area of Yellowknife was occupied by prospectors who ventured into the region in the mid-1930s.
A Klondike-bound prospector, E.A. Blakeney, made the first discovery of gold in the Yellowknife Bay area in the late 19th century. The discovery was viewed as unimportant in those days because of the Klondike Gold Rush and because Great Slave Lake was too far away to attract attention.Price, Ray. Yellowknife, Peter Martin Associates, Toronto, 1967. Page 22.
In the late 1920s, aircraft were first used to explore Canada's Arctic regions. Samples of uranium and silver were uncovered at Great Bear Lake in the early 1930s, and prospectors began fanning out to find additional metals.Watt, Frederick B. Great Bear: A Journey Remembered, Outcrop, Yellowknife, 1980. ISBN 0-919315-00-3. In 1933 two prospectors, Herb Dixon and Johnny Baker, canoed down the Yellowknife River from Great Bear Lake to survey for possible mineral deposits. They found gold samples at Quyta Lake, about [tpl]convert|30|km|abbr=on[/tpl] up the Yellowknife River, and some additional samples at Homer Lake.[ref]

The following year, Johnny Baker returned as part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl][/ref] Con Mine was the most impressive gold deposit and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936–1937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and the Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on September 5, 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.
The population of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in production in the Yellowknife region. However, by 1944, gold production had ground to a halt as men were needed for the war effort. An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable gold deposit in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife.Decoursey, Duke. The Yellowknife Years, Parkview Publishing, Squamish, British Columbia. Page 112. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine. The Yellowknife townsite expanded from the Old Town waterfront, and the new townsite was established during 1945–1946. The Discovery Mine, with its own townsite, operated [tpl]convert|81|km|abbr=on[/tpl] to the north-northeast of Yellowknife from 1950 to 1969.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl][/ref]
Between 1939 and 1953, Yellowknife was controlled by the Northern Affairs department (now Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada) of the Government of Canada. A small council, partially elected and partially appointed, made decisions. By 1953, Yellowknife had grown so much that it was made a municipality, with its own council and town hall. The first mayor of Yellowknife was John "Jock" McNiven. In September 1967, Yellowknife officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories. This important new status sparked what has been coined as the third boom in Yellowknife. New sub-divisions were established to house an influx of government workers.
In 1978 the Soviet nuclear-powered satellite Kosmos 954 crashed to Earth near Yellowknife. There were no known casualties, although a small quantity of radioactive nuclear fuel was released into the environment, and Operation Morning Light—an attempt to retrieve it—was only partially successful.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl][/ref] A new mining rush and fourth building boom for Yellowknife began with the discovery of diamonds [tpl]convert|300|km|abbr=on[/tpl] north of the city in 1991.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl][/ref] The last of the gold mines in Yellowknife closed in 2004. Today, Yellowknife is primarily a government town and a service centre for the diamond mines. On April 1, 1999, its purview as capital of the NWT was reduced when the territory of Nunavut was split from the NWT. As a result, jurisdiction for that region of Canada was transferred to the new capital city of Iqaluit. Consequently, Yellowknife lost its standing as the Canadian capital city with the smallest population.[ref]

==Geography and climate==

Yellowknife has a subarctic climate (Köppen: Dfc ) and averages less than [tpl]convert|300|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] of precipitation annually, as the city lies in the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. Thanks to its location on Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 100 days. Most of the limited precipitation falls between June and October, with April being the driest month of the year and August having the most rain fall. Snow that falls in winter accumulates on the ground until the spring thaw.
Yellowknife is on the Canadian Shield, which was scoured down to rock during the last ice age. The surrounding landscape is very rocky and slightly rolling, with many small lakes in addition to the larger Great Slave Lake. Trees such as spruce and birch are abundant in the area, as are smaller bushes, but there are also many areas of relatively bare rock with lichen. Yellowknife's high latitude causes a large variation between day and night. Daylight hours range from five hours of daylight in December to twenty hours in June. Twilight lasts all night from late May to early July.
Yellowknife has very cold winters and mild to warm summers. The average temperature in January is around [tpl]Convert|-26|C|0[/tpl] and [tpl]Convert|17|C|0[/tpl] in July. According to Environment Canada, Yellowknife has the sunniest summer in the country, averaging 1034 hours from June to August.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=43&submit=Submit | title = Sunniest Summer | work = Weather Winners | publisher = Environment Canada | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] The lowest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was [tpl]Convert|-51.2|C|0[/tpl] on 31 January 1947, and the highest was [tpl]Convert|32.5|C|0[/tpl] on 16 July 1989. Yellowknife averages 2256.5 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43.5% of possible daylight hours, ranging from a low of 15.4% in December to a high of 63.0% in June.

==Law and government==

Yellowknife has a municipal government system and is governed by the Yellowknife City Council, which consists of an elected Mayor and eight Councillors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://yellowknife.ca/City_Hall/City_Council.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080308202630/http://www.yellowknife.ca/City_Hall/City_Council.html|archivedate=2008-03-08|title=City Council|publisher=City of Yellowknife|accessdate=2008-02-23[/tpl] The Government of the Northwest Territories delegates powers to the municipality through legislative acts and regulations. Council meetings are held in the Council Chambers at City Hall on the second and fourth Monday of each month, and are open to the public. Municipal elections are held every three years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yellowknife.ca/Assets/Economic+Development/Community+Profile+2006.pdf |title=Yellowknife Community Profile 2006 |publisher=City of Yellowknife|date=2006-08-17|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-05-09 [/tpl] The current mayor of Yellowknife is Mark Heyck.
Yellowknife is represented in the territorial government by seven of the 19 Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories (MLAs). These MLAs are elected every four years and sit in the Northwest Territories Legislative Building, located in Yellowknife. The MLAs elect the Speaker of the House as well as six Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, which forms the Cabinet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.assembly.gov.nt.ca/_live/pages/wpPages/publicinformationfactsheets.aspx|title=Consensus Government|publisher=Government of the Northwest Territories|accessdate=2008-02-02[/tpl] In addition, a Commissioner is appointed by the Federal Government to fulfill a similar role to that of the Lieutenant Governor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.assembly.gov.nt.ca/visitors/what-consensus/differences-provincial-governments|title=Differences from Provincial Governments|publisher=Government of the Northwest Territories|accessdate=2014-01-30[/tpl] The Northwest Territories is one of only two federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions in Canada that operate under a consensus system of government.
The Northwest Territories is in the federal electoral riding of the Western Arctic and has one Member of Parliament and one Senator, currently Dennis Bevington and Nick Sibbeston, respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webinfo.parl.gc.ca/membersofparliament/ProfileConstituency.aspx?Key=572&Language=E|title=Constituency Profile - Western Arctic|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=2008-02-23[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sen.parl.gc.ca/nsibbeston/|title=Senator for the Northwest Territories|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=2008-02-23[/tpl] Yellowknife is home to seven of the 19 electoral districts in the Northwest Territories, the Frame Lake, Great Slave, Kam Lake, Range Lake, Weledeh, Yellowknife Centre and Yellowknife South ridings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.electionsnwt.ca/english/constituency_maps.html|title=Constituency Maps|publisher=Elections NWT|accessdate=2008-02-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071215234639/http://www.electionsnwt.ca/english/constituency_maps.html  |archivedate = 2007-12-15[/tpl]

==Economy==

As the largest city in the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife is the hub for mining, industry, transportation, communications, education, health, tourism, commerce, and government activity in the territory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1SEC882411 |title=Yellowknife (NWT) - Economy|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-02-23[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl] Historically, Yellowknife's economic growth came from gold mining, and later government; however, because of falling gold prices and increased operating costs, the final gold mine closed in 2004, marking a turning point for Yellowknife's economy.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.yellowknife.ca/Assets/Economic+Development/New+Paradigm+for+Economic+Growth.pdf|title=A New Paradigm for Economic Growth|publisher=City of Yellowknife|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-02-23[/tpl]
After a downturn in the 1990s during the closure of the gold mines and the downsizing of the government workforce in 1999, Yellowknife's economy has recovered, largely because of the diamond boom; the Ekati Diamond Mine, owned and operated by BHP Billiton (sold to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013), opened in 1998.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ekati.bhpbilliton.com/about_ekati/history.asp|title=History|publisher=BHP Billiton|accessdate=2008-02-23[/tpl] A second mine, Diavik Diamond Mine, began production in 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.diavik.ca/history.htm|publisher=Diavik Diamond Mines|title=History|accessdate=2008-02-23[/tpl] Production from the two operating mines in 2004 was [tpl]convert|12618000|carat|kg lb[/tpl], valued at over C$2.1 billion. This ranked Canada third in world diamond production by value, and sixth by weight. A third mine, De Beers' Snap Lake Diamond Mine, received final approval and funding in 2005 and went into production in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.debeerscanada.com/files_2/snap_lake/snap_schedule.html|title=Snap Lake: Project Schedule|publisher=De Beers|accessdate=2008-02-02[/tpl] De Beers also applied in 2005 for a permit to open the Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project on the property formerly known as Kennady Lake. Upon receipt of approval, construction is expected to start in 2010 and the mine will reach full production by 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mveirb.nt.ca/upload/project_document/Draft%20Workplan%20Gahcho%20Kue.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080409145809/http://www.mveirb.nt.ca/upload/project_document/Draft+Workplan+Gahcho+Kue.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-09|title=De Beers Gahcho Kue Diamond Project|publisher=Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-02-02[/tpl] As well, growth and expansion in natural gas development and exploration sectors has contributed to this growth. Economic growth in the Northwest Territories was 10.6% in 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.nt.ca/Statinfo/Generalstats/Scan/Scan_2006.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061004103359/http://www.stats.gov.nt.ca/Statinfo/Generalstats/Scan/Scan_2006.pdf|archivedate=2006-10-04|title=2006 NWT Socio-Economic Scan|publisher=Government of the Northwest Territories|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-05-12[/tpl]
The major employers in Yellowknife include: the Territorial Government, the Federal Government, Diavik Diamond Mines Incorporated (a subsidiary of Rio Tinto Group)/Harry Winston Diamond Corporation, BHP Billiton, First Air, NorthwesTel, RTL Robinson Trucking, and the City of Yellowknife. Government employment accounts for 7,644 jobs, a large percentage of those in Yellowknife.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.nt.ca/Statinfo/PublicSector/employ.otp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070627131416/http://www.stats.gov.nt.ca/Statinfo/PublicSector/employ.otp|archivedate=2007-06-27 |title=Public Sector Employment|publisher=Government of the Northwest Territories|accessdate=2007-05-12 [/tpl]
During winter, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is opened for semi-trailer truck traffic to take supplies from Yellowknife north to various mines located in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This ice road is usually open from the end of January through late March or early April, and Yellowknife becomes the dispatch point for the large number of truck drivers that come north to drive on the ice roads. During the 2007 ice road season, several drivers were featured on the History Channel TV series Ice Road Truckers.
Tourism is the largest renewable industry in the NWT and Yellowknife is the main entry point for visitors. Many of these tourists are Japanese, and come to experience the Northern climate and traditional lifestyle, as well as to see the Northern Lights. In 2004-05, visitors to the territory spent C$100.5 million.
The City of Yellowknife raises 50% of its operating revenue through property taxation. Both Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic School Board also raise a portion of their operating revenue through property taxation. Property taxes in Yellowknife are calculated through property assessment and the municipal and education mill rates. Mill rates in 2005 were 13.84 (residential) and 19.87 (commercial).

===Regional mines===

Yellowknife was originally established as a supply centre for numerous gold mines operating in the region in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The following is a list of the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium mines in the vicinity. Most mines in the Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.

==Infrastructure==

===Emergency services===

Policing in Yellowknife is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; Yellowknife is the headquarters for G Division, and houses more than 30 officers. Municipal enforcement services are provided by bylaw enforcement officers, who are employed by the city. The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yellowknife.ca/Assets/Economic+Development/Community+Profile+2007-2008.pdf|title=Yellowknife Community Profile 2007|publisher=City of Yellowknife|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl] A point of debate in recent years has been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one must dial one of two local numbers) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is high (currently estimated at around $1 million a year), and there have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2007-12/dec7_07em.html|title=911 might finally come|publisher=Northern News Services|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl] Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital.

===Utilities and services===

====Electricity====

Electricity is provided to Yellowknife by Northland Utilities, serving 6,350 residential and 800 commercial customers. Yellowknife operates almost entirely on hydroelectricity from the Snare-Bluefish systems,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iti.gov.nt.ca/publications/2009/energy/FShistoryofelectricityNWT.pdf|format=PDF|title=Energy Generation|publisher=Government of the Northwest Territories|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl] provided by the Northwest Territories Power Corporation (NTPC). NTPC's local production capacity is 67.9 megawatts, 30.89MW from 10 generators at the Jackfish Diesel Plant, 28.8MW from Snare Lake, and 7.5MW from Miramar Bluefish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ntpc.com/communities/powergeneration.html|title=NTPC Profile|publisher=Northwest Territories Power Corporation|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl]

====Communications====

Yellowknife's telephone services were established in 1947 by the independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, owned by investors mostly within the community. The system was sold at the end of 1963 to Canadian National Telecommunications, now Northwestel. Northwestel also provides manual mobile telephone service on VHF frequencies, and by the 1990s also provided cellular services that later were transferred to Bell Mobility.
Yellowknife's television services, in addition to over-the-air transmission begun in 1967, included the Mackenzie Media cable television system placed in service 1 September 1972, which was sold to Northwestel in late 1995.
In 2008 Northern based company Ice Wireless entered the market in Yellowknife, providing digital cellular products and services.

====Water and sewerage====

The City of Yellowknife provides pressurized potable water throughout the majority of the city, and has a network of gravity-fed sewage lines; trucked water and sewage is provided in areas not serviced by piped infrastructure. Sewage, with the aid of lift stations, is pumped to a series of lakes, referred to as Fiddler's Lake Lagoon, where it is held and allowed to naturally decompose. Water is obtained from the Yellowknife River and is disinfected with chlorine and liquid fluoride is added, but is not otherwise filtered or treated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pws.gov.nt.ca/water/Communtiy_Desc/Yellowknife.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090404140419/http://www.pws.gov.nt.ca/water/Communtiy_Desc/Yellowknife.htm|archivedate=2009-04-04|title=Yellowknife Water Supply|publisher=Public Works & Services, GNWT|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl]

====Waste services====

Residential garbage removal is through a user pay system, in which residents are allowed three [tpl]convert|77|l|abbr=on[/tpl] garbage bags per week; any additional bags must have a purchased tag. The City of Yellowknife Solid Waste Management Facility is located on the Ingraham Trail (Highway 4) [tpl]convert|2|km|abbr=on[/tpl] north of the city;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cjeffery.com/images/City_Facilities_Map.pdf |title=City Facilities |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-03-02[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl] salvaging is encouraged, and the dump is infamous for the number of still useful items often found in it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2007-09/sep19_07dm.html|title=Treasure hunting at the dump|publisher=Northern News Services|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl]

===Transportation===

Yellowknife, while isolated geographically, has a modern transportation system. The Yellowknife Airport [tpl]airport codes|YZF[/tpl] is the busiest airport in northern Canada, having 70,699 aircraft movements in 2007 and handling over 400,000 passenger and 30,000 tonnes of cargo yearly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/51F0010PIE/2007000/part2.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080307173924/http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/51F0010PIE/2007000/part2.htm|archivedate=2008-03-07|title=Aircraft Movement Statistics|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl] It has two asphalt runways, one [tpl]convert|7500|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] strip and another of [tpl]convert|5000|ft|abbr=on[/tpl];[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dot.gov.nt.ca/_live/pages/airports/airportProfile.aspx?AirportCode=YZF|title=Airport Profile|publisher=Department of Transportation, GNWT|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl] while the Yellowknife Airport is classified as an airport of entry by NAV CANADA and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency, it is certified for general aviation aircraft only. The Yellowknife airport is designated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as a forward operating location for the CF-18 Hornet.[tpl]CFS[/tpl] Despite its shorter runways, the airport can still accommodate 747s and other wide-body aircraft for emergency landings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2007-02/feb21_07rway.html|title=MLA says airport needs longer runway|publisher=Northern News Services|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2007-01/jan12_07em.html|title=Emergency landing from Germany|publisher=Northern News Services|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl] Air traffic control services, ILS (Category 1), and radar services are provided by NAV CANADA.
Yellowknife Transit is the public transportation agency in the city, and is the only transit system in the Northwest Territories.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yellowknife.ca/Assets/City+Clerks/Forms+And+Publications/TransitRouteAnalysisStudyFinalReportOctober2008.pdf|format=PDF|title=Transit Route Analysis Study Final Report|publisher=City of Yellowknife|accessdate=2009-03-26[/tpl]
Road construction in Yellowknife is often a challenge due to the presence of permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years. Most roads in Yellowknife are paved and road width varies from [tpl]convert|9|to|13.5|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. Winter snow removal is done on a regular schedule by the City of Yellowknife public works department. Speed limits are [tpl]convert|45|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] on most roads, [tpl]convert|30|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] in school zones, and [tpl]convert|70|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.
Until 2012, Yellowknife did not have a permanent road connection to the rest of Canada's highway network, as the Yellowknife Highway relied, depending on the season, on ferry service or an ice road to cross the Mackenzie River.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1295527--deh-cho-bridge-ends-north-s-reliance-on-ice-road |title=Deh Cho Bridge ends North’s reliance on ice road |author=Green, Jeff |date=November 29, 2012 |publisher=Toronto Star | accessdate=November 30, 2012[/tpl] With the completion of the Deh Cho Bridge, which officially opened on November 30, 2012, the city now has its first direct road connection to the rest of the country.

===Layout===

Yellowknife, like most other urban centres, has distinct commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Frame Lake, Niven Lake, Range Lake, and Old Town are the residential sectors, with some of the population living in high-rises in the downtown core. Niven Lake is the only area under active development and expansion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2008-02/feb22_08niv.html|title=Contractor cries foul|publisher=Northern News Services|accessdate=2008-03-02[/tpl] Downtown Yellowknife is home to most of the city's commercial activity, though some retail does exist in Range Lake. Industrial activity is limited to the Kam Lake and airport subdivisions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yellowknife.ca/Assets/Planning+and+Lands/Smarth+Growth+Redevelopment+Plan+Terms+of+Reference.pdf|title=Yellowknife Smart Growth Redevelopment Plan|publisher=City of Yellowknife|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-03-02[/tpl]
