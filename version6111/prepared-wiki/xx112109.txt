Dedworth is the most westerly area of Windsor in the English county of Berkshire.

==History==

The name Dedworth is formed from the words 'Dydda', meaning a man's name and 'Worth', a Saxon word for enclosure.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/villages/dedworth.html |title=History of Dedworth, Berkshire |author=Ford, David Nash |date=2001 |work=Royal Berkshire History |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |accessdate=10 October 2011[/tpl]
Dedworth was one of three Saxon villages (the other two being Clewer and Losfield) that Windsor expanded to encompass. Dedworth predates Windsor and is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Dideorde.[ref]

An irregular quadrangular moat in Wolf Lane may be all that remains of the manor house of Dedworth Maunsell. The other manor in the area was Dedworth Loring,  owned by the De Loring family from the time of Peter De Loring in the early 13th century. It was possibly located to the north where a large medieval hearth has been uncovered in the aptly named Knightâ€™s Close.

==Shops==

Dedworth has few shops, including: A Cooperative, A Boots Pharmacy, A Tesco, A Model Shop (Mantua Model UK Ltd), and many other shops.
