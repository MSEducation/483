The 20-minute video presents a critical vision of consumerist society, primarily American. It purports to expose "the connections between a huge number of environmental and social issues, and calls us together to create a more sustainable and just world."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.storyofstuff.com|title=The Story of Stuff|date=2008-07-28[/tpl] The video is divided into seven chapters: Introduction, Extraction, Production, Distribution, Consumption, Disposal, and Another Way.
The video divides up the materials economy into a system composed of extraction, production, distribution, consumption, and disposal. To articulate the problems in the system, Leonard adds people, the government, and corporations.
Leonard's thesis, "you cannot run a linear system on a finite planet indefinitely" is supported throughout the video by statistical data.  Although the video itself doesn't give attribution to her information, the producers provide an annotated script that includes footnotes with explanations and sources for some of her assertions:

The Story of Stuff has been subject to public discussion, especially after The New York Times published a front page article about the video on May 10, 2009.Leslie Kaufman, A Cautionary Video About America’s ‘Stuff’, The New York Times, May 10, 2009  The American Family Association says that the video is anti-consumer, and even anti-American because the video implies that Americans are greedy, selfish, cruel to the third world, and "use more than our share."  Glenn Beck, host of the Glenn Beck TV program on Fox News, characterized the video as an "anti-capitalist tale that unfortunately has virtually no facts correct."Debunking Story of Stuff, Glennbeck,com, September 22, 2009  Beck's website used a detailed critique made by Lee Doren of the Competitive Enterprise Institute in his "How the World Works" YouTube channel. FoxNews.com said that "some of the scariest figures" cited "are misleading or just plain wrong."Viral Video 'The Story of Stuff' Is Full of Misleading Numbers, FoxNews.com, May 14, 2009
Even before The New York Times article, The Sustainable Enterprise Fieldbook pointed to The Story of Stuff as a successful portrayal of the problems with the consumption cycle,[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Wirtenberg|Russell|Lipsky|2008|p=62[/tpl] and [tpl]Harvcoltxt|Greyson|2008[/tpl] says it is an engaging attempt to communicate circular economics.  Ralph Nader called the film "a model of clarity and motivation." John Passacantando,  Executive Director of Greenpeace, called it a "mega-hit on three levels".
Libertarian and politically conservative critics have characterized the documentary as misleading left-wing propaganda; one Montana school board opposed the screening of the film in a biology classroom in a 4–3 vote.Viral Video 'The Story of Stuff' Is Full of Misleading Numbers, Fox News, May 14, 2009Jesse Froehling, The Politics of Stuff, Missoula Independent, February 19, 2009Missoula School Board Bans Story of Stuff, Yes! March 11, 2009 The subsequent public outcry against this decision led to a rewrite of the school board's policy and an award for the teacher who screened the film.
