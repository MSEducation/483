Bill Nye the Science Guy is a live action educational television program that originally aired from September 10, 1993 to June 20, 1998 and was hosted by William "Bill" Nye. The show aired on PBS Kids and was also syndicated to local stations.
Each of the 100 half-hour episodes aims to teach a specific topic in a natural science to a preteen audience. The show is frequently used in schools as an education medium, and it still airs on some PBS stations for this reason.

==Synopsis==

Bill's TV persona is a tall and slender scientist wearing a blue lab coat and a bow-tie.[tpl]cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19941218&slug=1948193|title=The Bill Nye Effect|first=Kit|last=Boss|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=18 December 1994[/tpl] He mixes the serious science of everyday things with fast-paced action and humor. Each half-hour show begins with Bill walking onto the set, called "Nye Laboratories", which is filled with scientific visuals including many "of science" contraptions announced dramatically, relevant to the topic of the show. Most half-hour episodes contain a mock song parody and music video in the "Soundtrack of Science" by "Not That Bad Records", substituting a scientific roundup of the episode for the lyrics to a popular song. Each half-hour show ends with Bill explaining in a clever description of an activity on topic. The credits sometimes rolled next to a series of outtakes from the episode.

==Soundtrack==

The show's memorable bass-heavy theme song is set to a house beat with Bill's name shouted throughout the duration of the song. The sound and speed fluctuations of the voice were accomplished through a vocoder and electronic pitch fluctuation.
The show's episodes consisted of several compositions from Associated Production Music. Some featured tracks include:
Many of these tracks were also featured in SpongeBob SquarePants, Camp Lazlo, All That, KaBlam! and The Ren and Stimpy Show. Another common track used was the theme from the English show Dave Allen At Large, here used as the theme from "The Jackie Smazz Show."

==Production==

==Video game==

A computer game for the series, titled Bill Nye the Science Guy: Stop the Rock!, was released in 1996 for Windows and Macintosh by Pacific Interactive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BillNyeTheScienceGuyStopTheRock |title=VideoGame/Bill Nye the Science Guy: Stop the Rock! - Television Tropes & Idioms |publisher=Tvtropes.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09[/tpl]
In the game, a large meteoroid called "Impending Dumé" threatens to make a catastrophic collision with the Earth. A team of scientists develop a laser satellite-controlling computer system called MAAX (Meteoroid and Asteroid Exploder) to destroy the meteoroid; however, MAAX develops a personality of its own (in an obvious parody of the sentient computer HAL from the film and novel 2001: A Space Odyssey) and refuses to save the planet unless Earth's scientists can solve seven science riddles. Nye Labs decides to take on MAAX's challenge, and the player, depicted as the newest member of the Nye Labs team, is asked to solve these riddles using Nye Labs' equipment before Impending Dumé hits (represented through an in-game timer). The game featured a fully explorable Nye Labs, as well as video cut scenes featuring Bill and other Nye Labs scientists.  However, the characters and cast members from the TV series, sans Bill and a few others, do not appear in this game, instead being replaced by game-exclusive Nye Labs team members and new actors.
