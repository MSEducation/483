[[Alternative fuel]]

CATEGORIES: Alternative fuels, Fuels, Alternative energy, Sustainable technologies

Alternative fuels, known as non-conventional or advanced fuels, are any materials or substances that can be used as fuels, other than conventional fuels.  Conventional fuels include: fossil fuels (petroleum (oil), coal, and natural gas), as well as nuclear materials such as uranium and thorium, as well as artificial radioisotope fuels that are made in nuclear reactors.
Some well-known alternative fuels include biodiesel, bioalcohol (methanol,  ethanol, butanol), chemically stored electricity (batteries and fuel cells), hydrogen, non-fossil methane, non-fossil natural gas, vegetable oil, propane, and other biomass sources.

==Background==

The main purpose of fuel is to store energy, which should be in a stable form and can be easily transported to the place of production. Almost all fuels are chemical fuels. The user employs this fuel to generate heat or perform mechanical work, such as powering an engine. It may also be used to generate electricity, which is then used for heating, lighting, or other purposes.

==Biofuel==

Biofuels are also considered a renewable source. Although renewable energy is used mostly to generate electricity, it is often assumed that some form of renewable energy or a percentage is used to create alternative fuels.

===Biomass===

Biomass in the energy production industry is living and recently dead biological material which can be used as fuel or for industrial production.

===Algae-based fuels===

Algae-based biofuels have been promoted in the media as a potential panacea to crude oil-based transportation problems. Algae could yield more than 2000 gallons of fuel per acre per year of production.[tpl]cite web|url=http://greenworldinvestor.com/2010/06/04/is-algae-based-biofuel-a-great-green-investment-opportunity/ |title= Is Algae Based Biofuel a Great Green Investment Opportunity |publisher=Green World Investor |date= 2010-04-06 |accessdate=2010-07-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100617064204/http://greenworldinvestor.com/2010/06/04/is-algae-based-biofuel-a-great-green-investment-opportunity/| archivedate= 17 June 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Algae based fuels are being successfully tested by the U.S. Navy[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marinelog.com/DOCS/NEWSMMIX/2010oct00223.html |title= Navy demonstrates alternative fuel in riverine vessel |publisher=Marine Log |date= 2010-10-22 |accessdate=2010-07-11[/tpl] Algae-based plastics show potential to reduce waste and the cost per pound of algae plastic is expected to be cheaper than traditional plastic prices.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smartplanet.com/technology/blog/science-scope/can-algae-based-plastics-reduce-our-plastic-footprint/1605/ |title= Can algae-based plastics reduce our plastic footprint? |publisher=Smart Planet |date= 2009-10-07 |accessdate=2010-04-05[/tpl]

===Biodiesel===

Biodiesel is made from animal fats or vegetable oils, renewable resources that come from plants such as, soybean, sunflowers, corn, olive, peanut, palm, coconut, safflower, canola, sesame, cottonseed, etc. Once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol, biodiesel is brought to life[tpl]Clarify|date=October 2013[/tpl] from this chemical reaction. These raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions, or used alone. Despite one’s mixture preference, biodiesel will release smaller number of pollutants (carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons) than conventional diesel, because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently. Even with regular diesel’s reduced quantity of sulfur from the ULSD (ultra-low sulfur diesel) invention, biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free.[tpl]cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Jill|title=Alternative Cars|isbn=978-1-59928-803-1|page=21|year=2008|publisher=ABDO[/tpl]

==Alcohol fuels==

Methanol and ethanol fuel are primary sources of energy; they are convenient fuels for storing and transporting energy.  These alcohols can be used in internal combustion engines as alternative fuels. Butanol has another advantage: it is the only alcohol-based motor fuel that can be transported readily by existing petroleum-product pipeline networks, instead of only by tanker trucks and railroad cars. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]

==Ammonia==

Ammonia (chemical formula NH3) can be used as fuel. A small machine can be set up to create the fuel and it is used where it is made. Benefits of ammonia include no need for oil, zero emissions, low cost,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-09-pair-ammonia-fuel-cars-cents.html |first=Bob |last=Yirka |title=Pair claim they can make ammonia to fuel cars for just 20 cents per liter |publisher=Physorg.com |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2011-09-12[/tpl] and distributed production reducing transport and related pollution.

==Carbon-neutral and negative fuels==

Carbon neutral fuel is synthetic fuel—such as methane, gasoline, diesel fuel or jet fuel—produced from renewable or nuclear energy used to hydrogenate waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue exhaust gas or derived from carbonic acid in seawater.[tpl]Cite journal |last= Zeman |first= Frank S. |last2= Keith |first2= David W. |year= 2008 |title= Carbon neutral hydrocarbons |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A |volume= 366 |pages= 3901–18 |doi= 10.1098/rsta.2008.0143 |url= http://www.keith.seas.harvard.edu/papers/103.Zeman.2008.CHNCs.e.pdf |accessdate= September 7, 2012[/tpl] (Review.)[tpl]Cite journal |last= Wang |first= Wei |last2= Wang |first2= Shengping |last3= Ma |first3= Xinbin |last4= Gong |first4= Jinlong |year= 2011 |title= Recent advances in catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide |journal= Chemical Society Reviews |volume= 40 |issue= 7 |pages= 3703–27 |doi= 10.1039/C1CS15008A |url= http://69.12.216.122/co2hydrogenation.pdf |accessdate= September 7, 2012[/tpl] (Review.)[tpl]Cite journal |last= MacDowell |first = Niall |last2 = et al. |year= 2010 |title= An overview of CO2 capture technologies |journal= Energy and Environmental Science |volume= 3 |issue= 11 |pages= 1645–69 |doi= 10.1039/C004106H |url= http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2010/EE/c004106h |accessdate= September 7, 2012[/tpl] (Review.)[tpl]Cite journal |last= Eisaman |first= Matthew D. |last2= et al. |year= 2012 |title= CO2 extraction from seawater using bipolar membrane electrodialysis |journal= Energy and Environmental Science |volume= 5 |issue= 6 |pages= 7346–52 |doi= 10.1039/C2EE03393C |url= http://69.12.216.122/co2extraction.pdf |accessdate= September 7, 2012[/tpl] Such fuels are potentially carbon neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases.[tpl]Cite journal |last= Graves |first= Christopher |last2= Ebbesen |first2= Sune D. |last3= Mogensen |first3= Mogens |last4= Lackner |first4= Klaus S. |year= 2011 |title= Sustainable hydrocarbon fuels by recycling CO2 and H2O with renewable or nuclear energy |journal= Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume= 15 |issue= 1 |pages= 1–23 |doi= 10.1016/j.rser.2010.07.014 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032110001942 |accessdate= September 7, 2012[/tpl] (Review.)[tpl]Cite report |last= Socolow |first= Robert |coauthors= et al. |date= June 1, 2011 |title= Direct Air Capture of CO2 with Chemicals: A Technology Assessment for the APS Panel on Public Affairs |publisher= American Physical Society |type= peer reviewed literature review |url= http://www.aps.org/policy/reports/assessments/upload/dac2011.pdf |accessdate= September 7, 2012[/tpl] To the extent that carbon neutral fuels displace fossil fuels, or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid, and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe, they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere, and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation.[tpl]Cite journal |last= Goeppert |first= Alain |last2= Czaun |first2= Miklos |last3= Prakash |first3= G.K.

Carbon-neutral fuels have been proposed for distributed storage for renewable energy, minimizing problems of wind and solar intermittency, and enabling transmission of wind, water, and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines. Such renewable fuels could alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels, enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles.

Carbon capture from ambient air is more costly, at between $600 and $1000 per ton and is considered impractical for fuel synthesis or carbon sequestration.
Nighttime wind power is considered[tpl]By whom|date=October 2013[/tpl] the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel, because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day, but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day. Therefore, the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative. Off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the U.S. averaged 1.64 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2009, but only 0.71 cents/kWh during the least expensive six hours of the day. Typically, wholesale electricity costs 2 to 5 cents/kWh during the day.Bloomberg Energy Prices Bloomberg.com (compare to off-peak wind power price graph.) Retrieved September 7, 2012.

==Hydrogen==

Hydrogen is an emissionless fuel. The byproduct of hydrogen burning is water, although some mono-nitrogen oxides NOx are produced when hydrogen is burned with air.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/tech_validation/pdfs/fcm03r0.pdf |title=Module 3: Hydrogen use in internal combustion engines |author=College of the Desert |publisher=Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) |date=December 2001 |accessdate=2011-09-12 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://alternativefuels.about.com/od/politicalconsiderations/a/altfuelcost.htm |first=Christine |last=Gable|first2=Scott |last2=Gable |title=Fuel or Fool?|publisher= about.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-12[/tpl]

==HCNG==

HCNG (or H2CNG) is a mixture of compressed natural gas and 4-9 percent hydrogen by energy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/fuels/natural_gas_blends.html |title= Hydrogen/Natural Gas (HCNG) Fuel Blends |publisher=Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)  |date= 2009-10-07 |accessdate=2010-07-11[/tpl]

==Liquid nitrogen==

Liquid nitrogen is another type of emissionless fuel.

==Compressed air==

The air engine is an emission-free piston engine using compressed air as fuel. Unlike hydrogen, compressed air is about one-tenth as expensive as fossil oil, making it an economically attractive alternative fuel.

==Natural Gas Vehicles==

Compressed natural gas (CNG) and Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) are two a cleaner combusting alternatives to conventional liquid automobile fuels.

===CNG Fuel Types===

CNG vehicles can use both renewable CNG and non-renewable CNG.[tpl]cite journal|last=Frick |first=Martin |first2=Kay W. |last2=Axhausen |first3=Gian |last3=Carle |first4=Alexander |last4=Wokaun |title=Optimization of the distribution of compressed natural gas (CNG) refueling stations: Swiss case studies|journal=Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment |year=2007 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=10–22|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920906000691 |doi=10.1016/j.trd.2006.10.002[/tpl]
Conventional CNG is produced from the many underground natural gas reserves are in widespread production worldwide today.  New technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to economically  access  unconventional  gas  resources,  appear to have increased the supply of natural gas in a fundamental way.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cngva.org/media/4302/marbek_ngv_final_report-april_2010.pdf |title=Study of Opportunities for natural gas in the transportation sector |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |author=Marbek |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2013-02-19[/tpl]
Renewable natural gas or biogas is a methane‐based gas with similar properties to natural gas that can be used as transportation fuel.  Present sources  of  biogas  are mainly landfills,  sewage,  and  animal/agri‐waste.  Based  on  the  process type,  biogas  can  be  divided  into  the  following:  Biogas  produced  by  anaerobic  digestion, Landfill  gas  collected  from  landfills,  treated  to  remove  trace contaminants, and Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG).

==Nuclear power and radiothermal generators==

===Nuclear reactors===

Nuclear power is any nuclear technology designed to extract usable energy from atomic nuclei via controlled nuclear reactions. The only controlled method now practical uses nuclear fission in a fissile fuel (with a small fraction of the power coming from subsequent radioactive decay). Use of the nuclear reaction nuclear fusion for controlled power generation is not yet practical, but is an active area of research.
Nuclear power is usually used by using a nuclear reactor to heat a working fluid such as water, which is then used to create steam pressure, which is converted into mechanical work for the purpose of generating electricity or propulsion in water. Today, more than 15% of the world's electricity comes from nuclear power, and over 150 nuclear-powered naval vessels have been built.
In theory, electricity from nuclear reactors could also be used for propulsion in space, but this has yet to be demonstrated in a space flight. Some smaller reactors, such as the TOPAZ nuclear reactor, are built to minimize moving parts, and use methods that convert nuclear energy to electricity more directly, making them useful for space missions, but this electricity has historically been used for other purposes. Power from nuclear fission has been used in a number of spacecraft, all of them unmanned. The Soviets up to 1988 orbited 33 nuclear reactors in RORSAT military radar satellites, where electric power generated was used to power a radar unit that located ships on the Earth's oceans. The U.S. also orbited one experimental nuclear reactor in 1965, in the SNAP-10A mission. No nuclear reactor has been sent into space since 1988.

===Radiothermal generators===

In addition, radioisotopes have been used as alternative fuels, on both land and in space. Their use on land is declining due to the danger of theft of isotope and environmental damage if the unit is opened. The decay of radioisotopes generates both heat and electricity in many space probes, particularly probes to outer planets where sunlight is weak, and low temperatures is a problem. Radiothermal generators (RTGs) which use such radioisotopes as fuels do not sustain a nuclear chain reaction, but rather generate electricity from the decay of a radioisotope which has (in turn) been produced on Earth as a concentrated power source (fuel) using energy from an Earth-based nuclear reactor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.space4peace.org/ianus/npsm2.htm |title=Nuclear Powered Space Missions - Past and Future |first=Regina |last=Hagen |publisher=Space4peace.org |date=1998-08-11 |accessdate=2013-02-19[/tpl]
