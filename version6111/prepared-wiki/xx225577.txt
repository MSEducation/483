 Allmusic review 
|}}
"... Tropical Campfire's ..." is an album by Michael Nesmith, released in 1992 after Nesmith's 13-year hiatus from making studio albums.  "... Tropical Campfire's ..." is the 9th and final time Red Rhodes would play on a Michael Nesmith studio album (Rhodes died in 1995).
Allmusic writes "Along with Lindsey Buckingham's Out of the Cradle, this album may be one of the finest and most underrated albums of the 1990s."
All versions of this album were released encoded in the Dolby Digital Pro-Logic surround sound format. It can be decoded into surround sound using any Pro-Logic  multichannel receiver.
The unique (and seemingly, at first, incorrect) spelling of the album's title comes from an excerpt printed inside the CD booklet: "... Now she must navigate by the southwestern tropical campfire's mambo raga songs, their sounds rising from the desert floor ..."  The original 1992 CD on Pacific Arts reads "campfire's" but the 2001 and 2008 reissues have the apostrophe missing from the cover artwork.
