Stearin [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɪər|ɨ|n[/tpl], or tristearin, or glyceryl tristearate is a triglyceride derived from three units of stearic acid.  Most triglycerides are derived from at least two and more commonly three different fatty acids.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |author=Alfred Thomas |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |place=Weinheim |year=2002 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_173 |chapter=Fats and Fatty Oils |isbn=3527306730[/tpl]  Like other triglycerides, stearin can crystallise in three polymorphs.  For stearin, these melt at 54.5, 65, and [tpl]nowrap|73 °C[/tpl].

==Occurrence==

Stearin is obtained from animal fats created as a byproduct of processing beef. It can also be found in tropical plants such as palm. It can be partially purified by "dry fractionation" by pressing tallow or other fatty mixtures, leading to separation of the higher melting stearin-rich material from the liquid, which is typically enriched in fats derived from oleic acid. It can be obtained by "interesterification", again exploiting its higher melting point which allows the higher melting tristearin to be removed from the equilibrated mixture.  Stearin is a side product obtained during the extraction of cod liver oil removed during the chilling process at temperatures below [tpl]nowrap|−5 °C[/tpl].

==Uses==

It is used as a hardening agent[tpl]cite web|url=  http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02636720#page-2|title= Waxes in the candle industry[/tpl] in the manufacture of candles and soap.  In the manufacture of soap, stearin is mixed with a sodium hydroxide solution in water. The following reaction gives glycerin and sodium stearate, the main ingredient in most soap:
Stearin is also used in conjunction with aluminium flakes to help in the grinding process in making dark aluminium powder.
