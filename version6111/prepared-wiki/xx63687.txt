Onchocerciasis ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|ŋ|k|ɵ|s|ɜr|ˈ|s|aɪ|.|ə|s|ɨ|s[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|ŋ|k|ɵ|s|ɜr|ˈ|k|aɪ|.|ə|s|ɨ|s[/tpl]), also known as river blindness and Robles disease, is a disease caused by infection with the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus.[tpl]cite web|title=Onchocerciasis Fact sheet N°374|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs374/en/|work=World Health Oragnization|accessdate=20 March 2014|date=March 2014[/tpl] Symptoms include severe itching, bumps under the skin, and blindness. It is the second most common cause of blindness due to infection, after trachoma.
The parasite worm is spread by the bites of a black fly of the Simulium type. Usually many bites are required before infection occurs.[tpl]cite web|title=Parasites – Onchocerciasis (also known as River Blindness) Epidemiology & Risk Factors|url=http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/onchocerciasis/epi.html|work=CDC|accessdate=20 March 2014|date=May 21, 2013[/tpl] These flies live near rivers therefore the name of the disease.[tpl]cite web|title=Parasites – Onchocerciasis (also known as River Blindness)|url=http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/onchocerciasis/|work=CDC|accessdate=20 March 2014|date=May 21, 2013[/tpl] Once inside a person the worms create larva that make their way out to the skin. Here they can infect the next black fly that bites the person. There are a number of way to make the diagnosis including: placing a biopsy of the skin in normal saline and watching for the larva to come out, looking in the eye for larva, and looking within the bumps under the skin for adult worms.[tpl]cite web|title=Parasites – Onchocerciasis (also known as River Blindness) Diagnosis|url=http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/onchocerciasis/diagnosis.html|work=CDC|accessdate=20 March 2014|date=May 21, 2013[/tpl]
A vaccine against the disease does not exist. Prevention is by avoiding being bitten by flies.[tpl]cite web|title=Parasites – Onchocerciasis (also known as River Blindness) Prevention & Control|url=http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/onchocerciasis/prevent.html|work=CDC|accessdate=20 March 2014|date=May 21, 2013[/tpl] This may include the use of insect repellent and proper clothing, as well as improving sanitation practices and water management to reduce the presence of the flies. Efforts to eradicate the disease by treating entire groups of people twice a year is ongoing in a number of areas of the world. Treatment of those infected is with the medication ivermectin every six to twelve months. This treatment kill the larva but not the adult worms.[tpl]cite book|last=Brunette|first=Gary W.|title=CDC Health Information for International Travel 2012 : The Yellow Book |year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199830367|page=258|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=5vCQpr1WTS8C&pg=PA258[/tpl] The medication doxycycline, which kills an associated bacteria called Wolbachia, appears to weaken the worms and is recommended by some as well. Removal of the lumps under the skin by surgery may also be done.[tpl]cite book|last=Murray|first=Patrick|title=Medical microbiology|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia |isbn=9780323086929|page=792|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=RBEVsFmR2yQC&pg=PA792|edition=7th[/tpl]
About 17 to 25 million people are infected with river blindness, with approximately 0.8 million having some amount of loss of vision. Most infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa, although cases have also been reported in Yemen and isolated areas of Central and South America. In 1915, the physician Rodolfo Robles first linked the worm to eye disease.[tpl]cite book|last=Eldridge|first=ed. by Bruce F.|title=Medical entomology|year=2004|publisher=Kluwer Academic Pub.|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9781402017940|page=301|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=C7OxOqTKYS8C&pg=PA301|edition=Revised ed.|coauthors=Edman,, John D.[/tpl]

==Signs and symptoms==

Adult worms remain in subcutaneous nodules, limiting access to the host's immune system.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] Microfilariae, in contrast, are able to induce intense inflammatory responses, especially upon their death. Wolbachia species have been found to be endosymbionts of O. volvulus adults and microfilariae, and are thought to be the driving force behind most of O. volvulus morbidity. Dying microfilariae have been recently discovered to release Wolbachia surface protein that activates TLR2 and TLR4, triggering innate immune responses and producing the inflammation and its associated morbidity.[tpl]cite journal |journal=BMC Evol Biol |date=2010-02-17|pages=10:48 |title=Accelerated microevolution in an outer membrane protein (OMP) of the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia |author=Baldo L, Desjardins CA, Russell JA, Stahlhut JK, Werren JH |pmid=20163713 |pmc=2843615 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-10-48 |volume=10[/tpl]  The severity of illness is directly proportional to the number of infected microfilariae and the power of the resultant inflammatory response.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
Skin involvement typically consists of intense itching, swelling, and inflammation.Wani, M.G. (February 2008).http://www.southernsudanmedicaljournal.com/archive/2008-02/oncocerciasis.htmlOnchocerciasis. Sudan Medical Journal. A grading system has been developed to categorize the degree of skin involvement:[tpl]cite journal |title=Immune responses directed against microfilariae correlate with severity of clinical onchodermatitis and treatment history |author=Ali MM, Baraka OZ, AbdelRahman SI, Sulaiman SM, Williams JF, Homeida MM, Mackenzie CD |journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=187 |issue=4 |date=15 February 2003 |pages=714–7 |pmid=12599094|jstor=30085595 |doi=10.1086/367709 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|journal=Br J Dermatol |date=September 1993 |volume=129 |issue=3|pages=260–9|title=A clinical classification and grading system of the cutaneous changes in onchocerciasis |author=Murdoch ME, Hay RJ, Mackenzie CD, Williams JF, Ghalib HW, Cousens S, Abiose A, Jones BR|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.1993.tb11844.x |pmid=8286222[/tpl][tpl]Verify source|date=June 2010[/tpl]
Ocular involvement provides the common name associated with onchocerciasis, river blindness, and may involve any part of the eye from conjunctiva and cornea to uvea and posterior segment, including the retina and optic nerve. The microfilariae migrate to the surface of the cornea. Punctate keratitis occurs in the infected area. This clears up as the inflammation subsides. However, if the infection is chronic, sclerosing keratitis can occur, making the affected area become opaque. Over time, the entire cornea may become opaque, thus leading to blindness. Some evidence suggests the effect on the cornea is caused by an immune response to bacteria present in the worms.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]. The skin is itchy, with severe rashes permanently damaging patches of skin.

===Mazzotti reaction===

The Mazzotti reaction, first described in 1948, is a symptom complex seen in patients after undergoing treatment of onchocerciasis with the medication diethylcarbamazine(DEC). Mazzotti reactions can be life-threatening, and are characterized by fever, urticaria, swollen and tender lymph nodes, tachycardia, hypotension, arthralgias, oedema, and abdominal pain that occur within seven days of treatment of microfilariasis.
The phenomenon is so common when DEC is used that this drug is the basis of a skin patch test used to confirm that diagnosis. The drug patch is placed on the skin, and if the patient is infected with O. volvulus microfilaria, localized pruritus and urticaria are seen at the application site.http://microblog.me.uk/420

===Nodding disease===

This is an unusual form of epidemic epilepsy associated with onchocerciasis.Dowell SF, Sejvar JJ, Riek L, Vandemaele KA, Lamunu M, Kuesel AC, Schmutzhard E, Matuja W, Bunga S, Foltz J, Nutman TB, Winkler AS, Mbonye AK (2013) Nodding syndrome. Emerg Infect Dis 19(9):1374-3. doi: 10.3201/eid1909.130401 This syndrome was first described in Tanzania by L. Jilek-Aall during the 1960s. It occurs most commonly in Uganda and South Sudan.
It manifests itself in previously healthy 5-15-year-old children, is often triggered by eating or cold temperatures and is accompanied by cognitive impairment. Seizures occur frequently and may be difficult to control.
The electroencephalogram is abnormal but cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) are normal or show non specific changes. If there are abnormalities on the MRI they are usually present in the hippocampus. Polymerase chain reaction testing of the CSF does not show the presence of the parasite.

===Classification===

Onchocerciasis may be divided into the following phases or types:[tpl]cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; Elston, Dirk M; Odom, Richard B. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |edition=10th |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc=62736861 [/tpl][tpl]rp|440–441[/tpl][tpl]Verify source|date=May 2010[/tpl]
Additionally, the various skin changes associated with onchocerciasis may be described as follows:[tpl]rp|440[/tpl]

==Cause==

The cause is Onchocerca volvulus

===Life cycle===

The life of the parasite can be traced through the black fly and the human hosts in the following steps:[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]

==Prevention==

Various control programs aim to stop onchocerciasis from being a public health problem. The first was the Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP), which was launched in 1974, and at its peak, covered 30 million people in 11 countries. Through the use of larvicide spraying of fast-flowing rivers to control black fly populations, and from 1988 onwards, the use of ivermectin to treat infected people, the OCP eliminated onchocerciasis as a public health problem. The OCP, a joint effort of the World Health Organisation, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, was considered to be a success, and came to an end in 2002. Continued monitoring ensures onchocerciasis cannot reinvade the area of the OCP.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/blindness/partnerships/onchocerciasis_OCP/en/index.html |title=Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) |publisher=World Health Organization |work=Programmes and Projects |accessdate=2010-06-15[/tpl]
In 1992, the Onchocerciasis Elimination Programme for the Americas, which also relies on ivermectin, was launched.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/blindness/partnerships/onchocerciasis_oepa/en/index.html |title=Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas (OEPA) |publisher=World Health Organization |work=Programmes and Projects |accessdate=2010-06-15[/tpl]
In 1995, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control began covering another 19 countries, mainly relying upon the use of ivermectin. Its goal is to set up a community-directed supply of ivermectin for those who are infected. In these ways, transmission has declined.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/blindness/partnerships/APOC/en/index.html |title=African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) |publisher=World Health Organization |work=Programmes and Projects |accessdate=2010-06-15[/tpl]
On July 29, 2013, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) announced that after 16 years of efforts, Colombia had become the first country in the world to eliminate the parasitic disease onchocerciasi.[tpl]cite news|title=NEWS SCAN: Columbia ousts river blindness; Vaccine-derived polio in India; Danish Salmonella trends|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2013/07/news-scan-jul-30-2013|newspaper=CIDRAP News|date=July 30, 2013[/tpl]
No vaccine to prevent onchocerciasis infection in humans is available. A vaccine to prevent onchocerciasis infection for cattle is in phase three trials.  Cattle injected with a modified and weakened form of O. ochengi larvae have developed very high levels of protection against infection.  The findings suggest that it could be possible to develop a vaccine that protects people against river blindness using a similar approach.  Unfortunately, a vaccine to protect humans is still many years off.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

==Treatment==

In mass drug administration (MDA) programmes, the treatment for onchocerciasis is ivermectin (trade name: Mectizan); infected people can be treated with two doses of ivermectin, six months apart, repeated every three years. The drug paralyses and kills the microfilariae causing fever, itching, and possibly oedema, arthritis and lymphadenopathy. Intense skin itching is eventually relieved, and the progression towards blindness is halted. In addition, while the drug does not kill the adult worms, it does prevent them for a limited time from producing additional offspring. The drug therefore prevents both morbidity and transmission for up to several months.
Ivermectin treatment is particularly effective because it only needs to be taken once or twice a year, needs no refrigeration, and has a wide margin of safety, with the result that it has been widely given by minimally trained community health workers.[tpl]cite journal |title=Ivermectin and River Blindness |author=Rea PA, Zhang V, Baras YS |journal=American Scientist |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=294–303 |year=2010 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2010/4/ivermectin-and-river-blindness[/tpl]

===Antibiotics===

For the treatment of individuals, doxycycline is used to kill the Wolbachia bacteria that live in adult worms. This adjunct therapy has been shown to significantly lower microfilarial loads in the host, and may have activity against the adult worms, due to the symbiotic relationship between Wolbachia and the worm.[tpl]cite book |author=Trattler, Bill; Gladwin, Mark |title=Clinical Microbiology Made Ridiculously Simple |publisher=MedMaster |location=Miami |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-940780-81-X |oclc=156907378 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Taylor MJ, Bandi C, Hoerauf A |title=Wolbachia bacterial endosymbionts of filarial nematodes |journal=Adv. Parasitol. |volume=60 |issue= |pages=245–84 |year=2005 |pmid=16230105 |doi=10.1016/S0065-308X(05)60004-8 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0065-308X(05)60004-8[/tpl] In four separate trials over 10 years with various dosing regimens of doxycycline for individualized treatment, doxycycline was found to be effective in sterilizing the female worms and reducing their numbers over a period of four to six weeks. Research on other antibiotics, such as rifampicin, has shown it to been effective in animal models at reducing Wolbachia both as an alternative and as an adjunct to doxycycline.[tpl]cite journal |title=Filariasis: new drugs and new opportunities for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis |author=Hoerauf A |journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases |year=2008 |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=673–81 |pmid=18978537 |doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e328315cde7[/tpl] However, doxycycline treatment requires daily dosing for at least four to six weeks, making it more difficult to administer in the affected areas.

===Ivermectin===

Ivermectin kills the parasite by interfering with the nervous system and muscle function, in particular, by enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission. The drug binds to and activates glutamate-gated chloride channels. These channels, present in neurons and myocytes, are not invertebrate-specific, but are protected in vertebrates from the action of ivermectin by the blood–brain barrier. Ivermectin is thought to irreversibly activate these channel receptors in the worm, eventually causing an inhibitory postsynaptic potential. The chance of a future action potential occurring in synapses between neurons decreases and the nematodes experience flaccid paralysis followed by death.[tpl]cite journal |author=Yates DM, Wolstenholme AJ |title=An ivermectin-sensitive glutamate-gated chloride channel subunit from Dirofilaria immitis |journal=International Journal for Parasitology |volume=34 |issue=9 |date=August 2004 |pages=1075–81 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2004.04.010 |pmid=15313134[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Harder A |title=Chemotherapeutic approaches to nematodes: current knowledge and outlook |journal=Parasitology Research |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=272–7 |doi=10.1007/s00436-001-0535-x |pmid=11954915 |year=2002[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |journal=Parasitology |year=2005 |volume=131 |issue=Suppl:S85–95 |title=Glutamate-gated chloride channels and the mode of action of the avermectin/milbemycin anthelmintics |author=Wolstenholme AJ, Rogers AT |pmid=16569295 |pages=S85–95 |doi=10.1017/S0031182005008218[/tpl]
Ivermectin is directly effective against the larval stage microfilariae of O. volvulus; they are paralyzed and can be killed by eosinophils and macrophages. It does not kill adult females (macrofilariae), but does cause them to cease releasing microfilariae, perhaps by paralyzing the reproductive tract.
