At other incidence angles the reflectivity will also depend on the polarization of the incoming light. At a certain angle called Brewster's angle, p-polarized light (light with the electric field in the plane of incidence) will be totally transmitted. Brewster's angle can be calculated from the two refractive indices of the interface as

===Dielectric constant===

The refractive index of electromagnetic radiation equals
The frequency dependent dielectric constant is simply the square of the (complex) refractive index in a non-magnetic medium (one with a relative permeability of unity). The refractive index is used for optics in Fresnel equations and Snell's law; while the dielectric constant is used in Maxwell's equations and electronics.
Conversion between refractive index and dielectric constant is done by:

===Density===

In general, the refractive index of a glass increases with its density. However, there does not exist an overall linear relation between the refractive index and the density for all silicate and borosilicate glasses. A relatively high refractive index and low density can be obtained with glasses containing light metal oxides such as Li2O and MgO, while the opposite trend is observed with glasses containing PbO and BaO as seen in the diagram at the right.
Many oils (such as olive oil) and ethyl alcohol are examples of liquids which are more refractive, but less dense, than water, contrary to the general correlation between density and refractive index.

This means that it is also proportional to the pressure and inversely proportional to the temperature for ideal gases.

===Group index===

Sometimes, a "group velocity refractive index", usually called the group index is defined:
where vg is the group velocity. This value should not be confused with n, which is always defined with respect to the phase velocity.  When the dispersion is small, the group velocity can be linked to the phase velocity by the relation[tpl]cite book|title=Principles of Optics, 7th (expanded) edition|author=Born, Max and Wolf, Emil|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oV80AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA22|page=22|isbn=978-0-521-78449-8|date=2000[/tpl]
In this case the group index can thus be written in terms of the wavelength dependence of the refractive index as
When the refractive index of a medium is known as a function of the vacuum wavelength (instead of the wavelength in the medium), the corresponding expressions for the group velocity and index are (for all values of dispersion) [ref]

===Momentum (Abraham–Minkowski controversy)===

In 1908, Hermann Minkowski calculated the momentum of a refracted ray, p, where E is energy of the photon, c is the speed of light in vacuum and n is the refractive index of the medium as follows:[tpl]cite journal|last=Minkowski|first=Hermann|year=1908|title=Die Grundgleichung für die elektromagnetischen Vorgänge in bewegten Körpern|journal=Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse|pages=53–111|url=http://www.digizeitschriften.de/resolveppn/GDZPPN00250152X[/tpl]
In 1909, Max Abraham proposed the following formula for this calculation:[tpl]cite journal|first=Max|last=Abraham|title=Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper |journal=Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo|volume=28|year=1909|issue=1[/tpl]
A 2010 study suggested that both equations are correct, with the Abraham version being the kinetic momentum and the Minkowski version being the canonical momentum, and claims to explain the contradicting experimental results using this interpretation.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.070401|title=Resolution of the Abraham-Minkowski Dilemma|first=Stephen|last=Barnett|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=2010-02-07|volume=104|issue=7|page=070401|pmid=20366861|bibcode = 2010PhRvL.104g0401B [/tpl]

===Other relations===

As shown in the Fizeau experiment, when light is transmitted through a moving medium, its speed relative to a stationary observer is:
The refractive index of a substance can be related to its polarizability with the Lorentz–Lorenz equation or to the molar refractivities of its constituents by the Gladstone–Dale relation.

===Refractivity===

In atmospheric applications, the refractivity is defined as N = [tpl]val|e=6[/tpl](n – 1).[tpl]cite journal |last=Aparicio |first=Josep M. |last2=Laroche |first2=Stéphane |date=2011-06-02 |title=An evaluation of the expression of the atmospheric refractivity for GPS signals |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010JD015214/abstract |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |publisher=American Geophysical Union |volume=116 |issue=D11 |pages=D11104 |doi=10.1029/2010JD015214 |accessdate=13 January 2014[/tpl] The 106 factor is chosen because for air, n deviates from unity at most a few parts per ten thousand.
Molar refractivity, on the other hand, is a measure of the total polarizability of a mole of a substance and can be calculated from the refractive index as
where ρ is the density, and M is the molecular mass.[tpl]cite book |last=Born |first=Max |last2=Wolf |first2=Emil |date=1999 |title=Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light |edition=7th |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-64222-1 |page=93[/tpl]

==Nonscalar, nonlinear, or nonhomogeneous refraction==

So far, we have assumed that refraction is given by linear equations involving a spatially constant, scalar refractive index. These assumptions can break down in different ways, to be described in the following subsections.

===Birefringence===

In some materials the refractive index depends on the polarization and propagation direction of the light. This is called birefringence or optical anisotropy.
Many crystals are naturally birefringent, but isotropic materials such as plastics and glass can also often be made birefringent by introducing a preferred direction through, e.g., an external force or electric field. This can be utilized in the determination of stresses in structures using photoelasticity. The birefringent material is then placed between crossed polarizers. A change in birefringence will alter the polarization and thereby the fraction of light that is transmitted through the second polarizer.
In the more general case of trirefringent materials described by the field of crystal optics, the dielectric constant is a rank-2 tensor (a 3 by 3 matrix). In this case the propagation of light cannot simply be described by refractive indices except for polarizations along principal axes. 
In materials simultaneously lacking time-reversal and spatial inversion symmetry (for example multiferroics), refractive indices can be different even for counter-propagating light beams, which effect is termed as directional birefringence.http://magnetooptics.phy.bme.hu/research/topics/optical-properties-of-multiferroic-materials/

===Nonlinearity===

The strong electric field of high intensity light (such as output of a laser) may cause a medium's refractive index to vary as the light passes through it, giving rise to nonlinear optics. If the index varies quadratically with the field (linearly with the intensity), it is called the optical Kerr effect and causes phenomena such as self-focusing and self-phase modulation. If the index varies linearly with the field (a nontrivial linear coefficient is only possible in materials that do not possess inversion symmetry), it is known as the Pockels effect.

===Inhomogeneity===

If the refractive index of a medium is not constant, but varies gradually with position, the material is known as a gradient-index medium and is described by gradient index optics. Light traveling through such a medium can be bent or focused, and this effect can be exploited to produce lenses, some optical fibers and other devices. Some common mirages are caused by a spatially varying refractive index of air.

==Refractive index measurement==

===Homogeneous media===

The refractive index of liquids or solids can be measured with refractometers. They typically measure some angle of refraction or the critical angle for total internal reflection. The first laboratory refractometers sold commercially were developed by Ernst Abbe in the late 19th century.[ref]

This type of devices are commonly used in chemical laboratories for identification of substances and for quality control. Handheld variants are used in agriculture by, e.g., wine makers to determine sugar content in grape juice, and inline process refractometers are used in, e.g., chemical and pharmaceutical industry for process control.
In gemology a different type of refractometer is used to measure index of refraction and birefringence of gemstones. The gem is placed on a high refractive index prism and illuminated from below. A high refractive index contact liquid is used to achieve optical contact between the gem and the prism. At small incidence angles most of the light will be transmitted into the gem, but at high angles total internal reflection will occur in the prism. The critical angle is normally measured by looking through a telescope.[ref]

===Refractive index variations===

To measure the spatial variation of refractive index in a sample phase-contrast imaging methods are used. These methods measure the variations in phase of the light wave exiting the sample. The phase is proportional to the optical path length the light ray has traversed, and thus gives a measure of the integral of the refractive index along the ray path. The phase cannot be measured directly at optical or higher frequencies, and therefore needs to be converted into intensity by interference with a reference beam. In the visual spectrum this is done using Zernike phase-contrast microscopy, differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC) or interferometry.
Zernike phase-contrast microscopy introduces a phase shift to the low spatial frequency components of the image with a phase-shifting annulus in the Fourier plane of the sample, so that higher frequency parts of the image can interfere with the low frequency reference beam. In DIC the illumination is split up into two beams that are given different polarizations, are phase shifted differently, and are shifted transversely with slightly different amounts. After the specimen the two parts are made to interfere giving an image of the derivative of the optical path length in the direction of the difference in transverse shift.[ref]
</ref>
In interferometry the illumination is split up into two beams by a partially reflective mirror. One of the beams is let through the sample before they are combined to interfere and give a direct image of the phase shifts. If the optical path length variations are more than a wavelength the image will contain fringes.
There exist several phase-contrast x-ray imaging techniques to determine 2D or 3D spatial distribution of refractive index of samples in the x-ray regime.[ref]

==Applications==

The refractive index of a material is the most important property of any optical system that uses refraction. It is used to calculate the focusing power of lenses, and the dispersive power of prisms. It can also be used as a useful tool to differentiate between different types of gemstone, due to the unique chatoyance each individual stone displays.
Since refractive index is a fundamental physical property of a substance, it is often used to identify a particular substance, confirm its purity, or measure its concentration. Refractive index is used to measure solids (glasses and gemstones), liquids, and gases. Most commonly it is used to measure the concentration of a solute in an aqueous solution. A refractometer is the instrument used to measure refractive index. For a solution of sugar, the refractive index can be used to determine the sugar content (see Brix).
In GPS, the index of refraction is utilized in ray-tracing to account for the radio propagation delay due to the Earth's electrically neutral atmosphere. It is also used in Satellite link design for the Computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere.
