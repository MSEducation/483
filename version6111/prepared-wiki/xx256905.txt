Shadows Over Chinatown (1946) is the second to last film featuring Sidney Toler as Charlie Chan.

==Synopsis==

Chan investigates a murder for profit racket in San Francisco.  Toller was in poor health during the filming of this, and so much of the film is carried by the comedic interplay between #2 Son (Victor Sen Yung) and chauffeur, Birmingham Brown (Mantan Moreland).
