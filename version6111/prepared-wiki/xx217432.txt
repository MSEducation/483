[[Hymn (software)]]

CATEGORIES: Free audio software, ITunes

Hymn (stylized as hymn), which stands for Hear Your Music aNywhere is a piece of computer software, and the successor to the PlayFair program. The purpose of Hymn, according to its author (who is currently anonymous for fear of legal proceedings), is to allow people to exercise their fair use rights under United States copyright law.
The program allows the user to remove the FairPlay DRM restrictions of music bought from the iTunes Store.
Most DRM removal programs rely on re-compressing the media that is captured after it is output by iTunes. This causes some loss in quality. However, Hymn can remove DRM with no reduction in sound quality, since it captures the raw AAC stream generated by iTunes as it opens each song, and saves this data using a compression structure identical to that of the original file, preserving both the quality and the small file size. The resultant files can then be played outside of the iTunes environment, including operating systems not supported by iTunes. It works (with a plugged-in iPod) on Mac OS X, on many Unix variants, and also on Windows (with or without an iPod).
The Mac OS X version includes a drag-and-drop graphical user interface. All other platforms have only a command-line interface at this time. Prebuilt binaries are available for both Mac OS X and Windows, and the source code is available for all platforms. There is also a Java-based GUI version of the program called JHymn.
The program and its source code are available under the GNU General Public License.
JHymn superseded Hymn as the official software of The Hymn Project.
The Hymn website has announced that, because users can no longer purchase music using iTunes 5 or older, removal of iTunes DRM for now is best accomplished with the use of MyFairTunes6 or QTFairUse6.http://Hymn-project.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1314[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] These programs currently work with the latest version of iTunes (8.0.1 as of 3 October 2008).
As of February 20, 2008, the site host received a C&D letter demanding that all downloads be removed from the site. The moderator said that "Until further notice, no links are to be posted anywhere on the site to programs that can strip DRM from any of Apple's music or videos. Any user who does so will get the link removed and a warning from us. Any further infraction will get you banned permanently.".http://appleweblog.com/2008/02/a-vueltas-con-el-drm-cese-y-desista-al-hymn-project A vueltas con el DRM - cese y desista al Hymn projecthttp://hymn-project.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=17241#17241 Hymn - View topic - Cease and desist[tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl] The FAQ of the forum now says: "Anyone who posts a link to a DRM removal program will be banned.
