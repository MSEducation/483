==History==

Formation
The band formed when Jeff Hardy decided to follow up a childhood dream of becoming a rockstar. He, along with Shannon Moore, were the first members of the group. Members of Fueled by Science and Burnside 6 later joined the group. 
Origin of the name Peroxwhy?gen
According to Jeff Hardy, he thought of the name 'Peroxwhy?gen' one day while staring at an aerosol can. Whilst looking at the can, the word peroxide caught his eye. Hardy then combined two words, peroxide and oxygen before deciding to place the word 'why?' in between the two, thus creating the name, 'Peroxwhy?gen'
