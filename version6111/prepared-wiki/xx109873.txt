‘Abdu Manāf ibn Quṣayy ([tpl]lang-ar|عبد مناف بن قصي[/tpl]) was a Quraishi and great-great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his cousin the first Shia Imam Ali. His father was Quṣayy ibn Kilāb.

==Biography==

'Abdu Manāf was already honoured in his father's lifetime however Quṣayy preferred his first-born 'Abd ad-Dar and invested him with all his rights, powers, and transferred the ownership of the House of Assembly shortly before his death.[tpl]cite book |last=Lings|first=Martin|title=Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources|year=1983|publisher=George Allen & Unwin|page=6-7|isbn=0946621330[/tpl]
After Quṣayy's death Abd Manaf and his brother 'Abd ad-Dar  apparently quarreled, and the effects of this conflict continued among their descendants and affected the internal Makkah right up to Muhammad's time. 'Abd ad-Dar  was supported by their cousins Makhzum, Sahm, Jumah, their uncle Adi and their families. Abd Manaf contested his inheritance and was supported by their nephew Asad, their uncle Zuhrah ibn Kilab, their father's uncle Taym ibn Murrah, and al-Harith ibn Fihr.[tpl]cite book |last=Armstrong|first=Karen|title=Muhammad: A Biography of the Prophet|year=2001|publisher=Phoenix|page=66|isbn=0946621330[/tpl]

==History==

The two sides had even got so far as agreeing to go outside the sanctuary of the sacred area in order to battle it out, when a compromise was at last reached, feeling rose so high that the women of the clan of 'Abd Manaf brought a bowl of rich perfume with nutmeg powder and placed it beside the Ka'aba; and Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf and his brothers and all their allies dipped their hands in it and swore a solemn oath of allegiance that they would never abandon one another, rubbing their scented hands over the stone of the Ka'aba in confirmation of their pact. Thus it was that this group of clans were known as the "Hilf al-Mutayyabun" or "Alliance of the Scented Ones". Their rivals the allies of 'Abd ad-Dar likewise swore an oath of union, and also organised themselves into a pact and became known as the "Hilf al-Ahlaf" or "Alliance of the Confederates".
Neither side wanted a full scale conflict and a compromise was achieved whereby The Confederates retained normal privileges in control of the charity tax and the food and drink for pilgrims, whereas real power resided with the Scented Ones who had the keys to the Ka'aba and the running of the House of Assembly.Ibn Kathir 1.186. Hilf, or tahalluf, comes from halafa, to form a confederacy, for mutual help and protection. Therefore the sons of 'Abd Manaf should have the rights of levying the tax and providing for the pilgrims with food and drink, whereas the sons of Abd ad-Dar should retain the keys of the Ka'aba and their rights, and that their house should continue to be the House of Assembly. Hashim's brothers agreed that he should have the responsibility of providing for the pilgrims.[tpl]cite book |last=Lings|first=Martin|title=Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources|year=1983|publisher=George Allen & Unwin|page=7|isbn=0946621330[/tpl] Their descendants in the clans named after them tended to keep this old alliance.

==Family==

He married several wives of influential tribes, including 'Ātikah bint Murrah ibn Hilāl ibn Fālij ibn Dhakwān of Bani Qays Aylan, Hilal of the Banu Hawāzin, Raytah of Ta'if, and Waqida bint Amr.
Raytah had only the son Abd or Abdu'l Amr, who died childless; Waqida also had one son, Nawfal. The Hawazin heiress Atikah, however, bore him five sons and six daughters. The boys were twin sons called Amr (more commonly known as Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf), Abd Shams, Muttalib, Hala and Barra.http://web.genealogie.free.fr/Les_Dynasties/Les_Dynasties_musulmanes/Dynastie_de_Mahomet.htm Muttalib was younger than Hashim and became his successor. The daughters were Tumadir/Tamadur, Qilaba, Hayya, Raytah/Rita, Umm Akhtham, and Umm Sufyan.[tpl]cite news |last=Maqsood|first=Ruqaiyyah Waris|url=http://www.ruqaiyyah.karoo.net/articles/prophfamily4.htm|title=The Prophet’s Family Line No. 4 – Amr (Hashim), the Founder of the Hashimites|location= |work= |publisher=Ruqaiyyah Waris Maqsood Dawah|date= |accessdate=3 August 2011[/tpl]
