Oxbridge is a portmanteau (morphological blend) of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The term is used to refer to them collectively in contrast to other British universities and more broadly to describe characteristics reminiscent of them, often with implications of superior social or intellectual status.[tpl]cite book | title=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/135559 | publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=Originally: a fictional university, esp. regarded as a composite of Oxford and Cambridge.

==Origins==

Although both universities were founded more than eight centuries ago, the term Oxbridge is relatively recent. In William Thackeray's novel Pendennis, published in 1849, the main character attends the fictional Boniface College, Oxbridge. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this is the first recorded instance of the word.  Virginia Woolf used it, citing Thackeray, in her 1929 essay A Room of One's Own.  By 1957 the term was used in the Times Educational Supplement[tpl]cite news |author=G.D.

H. Halsey[/tpl]
When expanded, the universities are almost always referred to as "Oxford and Cambridge", the order in which they were founded. A notable exception is Japan's Cambridge and Oxford Society, probably arising from the fact that the Cambridge Club was founded there first, and also had more members than its Oxford counterpart when they amalgamated in 1905.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.camford.org/Whycamford.htm|title=Why The "Cambridge & Oxford Society"?|date=1995-04-05|author=Giro Koike|accessdate=2008-09-08[/tpl]

==Meaning==

In addition to being a collective term, Oxbridge is often used as shorthand for characteristics that the two institutions share:

Entrance is extremely competitive and some schools promote themselves based on their achievement of Oxbridge offers. Combined, the two universities award over one-sixth of all English full-time research doctorates.[tpl]cite web |title = Research degree qualification rates |date= July 2010 |url = http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/hefce/2010/10_21/#exec |publisher = Higher Education Funding Council for England [/tpl]
The word Oxbridge may also be used pejoratively: as a descriptor of social class (referring to the professional classes who dominated the intake of both universities at the beginning of the twentieth century),[tpl]cite book |author=Robert David Anderson |publisher=OUP |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-820660-6 |title=European universities from the Enlightenment to 1914 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Sf6NeT3045IC&pg=PA135 |page=135 |accessdate=2009-03-22[/tpl] as shorthand for an elite that "continues to dominate Britain's political and cultural establishment"[tpl]Cite journal|title=Oxbridge Blues|publisher=The Guardian|url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/carole_cadwalladr/2008/03/oxbridge_blues.html|author=Carole Cadwalladr|date=16 March 2008|postscript=[/tpl] and a parental attitude that "continues to see UK higher education through an Oxbridge prism",[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jan/20/oxbridgeandelitism.schools |title=Down but not out |publisher=The Guardian |author=Eric Thomas |authorlink=Eric Thomas (academic) |date=2004-01-20 |accessdate=2009-08-28 | location=London[/tpl] or to describe a "pressure-cooker" culture that attracts and then fails to support overachievers "who are vulnerable to a kind of self-inflicted stress that can all too often become unbearable"[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/elizabeth-davies-the-overpressured-hothouse-that-is-oxbridge-437155.html |work=The Independent |title=The over-pressured hothouse that is Oxbridge |quote=Two recent deaths have brought the issue of Oxbridge students' mental health back to the surface |date=2007-02-21 |accessdate=2009-02-02 |author=Elizabeth Davies | location=London[/tpl] and high-flying state school students who find "coping with the workload very difficult in terms of balancing work and life" and "feel socially out of their depth".[tpl]cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_/ai_n17191156 |publisher=The Spectator |date=2006-12-02 |author=Charlie Boss |title=Why so many state school pupils drop out of Oxbridge |accessdate=2009-02-02[/tpl]

Thackeray's Pendennis also introduced the term Camford as another combination of the university names – "he was a Camford man and very nearly got the English Prize Poem" – although this term has never achieved the same degree of usage as Oxbridge.
Other words have been derived from the term Oxbridge. One example is Doxbridge, an annual inter-collegiate sports tournament between some of the colleges of Durham, Oxford, York and Cambridge,[tpl]cite web | title=The University Sports Tour for Easter 2008 | url=http://www.doxbridge.co.uk/index.html | accessdate = 2008-04-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080402051845/http://www.doxbridge.co.uk/index.html  |archivedate = 2008-04-02[/tpl] while Woxbridge is seen in the name of the annual Woxbridge conference between the business schools of Warwick, Oxford and Cambridge.[tpl]cite web|title=Woxbridge 2011|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wbs/conf/woxbridge2011/|work=Conference Website[/tpl] The term Loxbridge (referring to London, Oxford, and Cambridge) is sometimes seen,[tpl]cite journal | author=Morgan, K.
