Abel-meholah   ([tpl]lang-he|אָבֵל מְחוֹלָה[/tpl], Avel Mehola)    was the birthplace and residence of the prophet Elisha. It is located near where the Wady el-Maleh merges into the Jordan River, south of Bethshean. Here Elisha was found at his plough by Elijah on his return up the Jordan valley from Horeb (1 Kings 19:16). It is now called 'Ain Helweh.
