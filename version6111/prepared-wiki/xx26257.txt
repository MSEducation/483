Nutrients are the nutritious components in foods that an organism utilizes to survive and grow. Macronutrients provide the bulk energy for an organism's metabolic system to function, while micronutrients provide the necessary cofactors for metabolism to be carried out.  Both types of nutrients can be acquired from the environment.Whitney, Elanor and Sharon Rolfes. 2005. Understanding Nutrition, 10th edition, p 6. Thomson-Wadsworth. They are used to build and repair tissues, regulate body processes, and are converted to and used for energy. Methods for nutrient intake are different for plants and animals. Plants take in nutrients directly from the soil through their roots and from the atmosphere through their leaves.  Animals and protists have specialized digestive systems that work to break down macronutrients for energy and utilize micronutrients to carry out both metabolism and anabolism or constructive synthesis in the body.
Organic nutrients include carbohydrates, fats, proteins (or their building blocks, amino acids), and vitamins. Inorganic chemical compounds such as dietary minerals, water, and oxygen may also be considered nutrients.[tpl]cite book|author1=FRANCES SIZER|author2=ELLIE WHITNEY|title=NUTRITION: CONCEPTS AND CONTROVERSIES|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mDhMU0Sv6asC&pg=PT26|accessdate=12 October 2010|date=12 November 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-39065-7|pages=26–[/tpl] A nutrient is said to be "essential" if it must be obtained from an external source, either because the organism cannot synthesize it or produces insufficient quantities. Nutrients needed in very small amounts are micronutrients and those that are needed in larger quantities are called macronutrients. The effects of nutrients are dose-dependent and shortages are called deficiencies.[tpl]cite book|author=Audrey H.

==Types of nutrient==

Macronutrients are defined in several different ways.[tpl]cite book|author=Mark Kern|title=CRC desk reference on sports  nutrition|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uOYqeeXWomwC&pg=PA117|accessdate=12 October 2010|date=12 May 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-2273-0|pages=117–[/tpl]

===Substances that provide energy===

Fat has an energy content of 9 kcal/g (~37.7 kJ/g); proteins and carbohydrates 4 kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g). Ethanol (grain alcohol) has an energy content of 7 kcal/g (~29.3 kJ/g).Coyle EF. 1995. Fat metabolism during exercise. Sports science exchange 8(6):59-65

===Substances that support metabolism===

Plants absorb nutrients from the soil or the atmosphere, or from water (mainly aquatic plants).  An exception are the carnivorous plants, which externally digest nutrients from animals before ingesting them.[tpl]cite book|author1=David Sadava|author2=H. Craig Heller|author3=David M. Hillis|coauthors=May Berenbaum|title=Life: The Science of Biology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ANT8VB14oBUC&pg=PA767|accessdate=12 October 2010|year=2009|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4292-1962-4|pages=767–[/tpl]
The chemical elements consumed in the greatest quantities by plants are carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These are present in the environment in the form of water and carbon dioxide; energy is provided by sunlight.[tpl]cite book|author=J. Benton Jones|title=Plant nutrition manual|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rNP2exwYMJIC&pg=PA34|accessdate=14 October 2010|year=1998|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-884015-31-1|pages=34–[/tpl] Nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur are also needed in relatively large quantities. Together, the "Big Six" are the elemental macronutrients for all organisms,[ref]
New Link in Chain of Life, Wall Street Journal, 2010-12-03, accessed 2010-12-05. "Until now, however, they were all thought to share the same biochemistry, based on the Big Six, to build proteins, fats and DNA."[/ref]
often represented by the acronym CHNOPS.[ref]
CHNOPS: The Six Most Abundant Elements of Life, Pearson BioCoach, 2010, accessed 2010-12-09. "Most biological molecules are made from covalent combinations of six important elements, whose chemical symbols are CHNOPS. ... Although more than 25 types of elements can be found in biomolecules, six elements are most common. These are called the CHNOPS elements; the letters stand for the chemical abbreviations of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur."[/ref]
Usually they are sourced from inorganic (e.g. carbon dioxide, water, nitrate, phosphate, sulfate) or organic (e.g. carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) compounds, although elemental diatomic molecules of nitrogen and (especially) oxygen are often used.
Other chemical elements are also necessary to carry out various life processes and build structures; see fertilizer and micronutrient for more information.
Some of these are considered macronutrients in certain organisms. The mnemonic C. HOPKiN'S CaFe Mg (to be used as C. Hopkins coffee mug) is used by some students to remember the list as: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, sulfur, calcium, iron, and magnesium. Silicon, chloride, sodium, copper, zinc, and molybdenum are sometimes also included, but are in other cases considered micronutrients.[tpl]Cite book| last = Perry | first =  David A| year = 1994| title = Forest ecosystems| url = http://books.google.com/?id=ZWNtHLz3fXYC&pg=PA340&dq=C.+HOPKiNS+CaFe+Mg| isbn = 978-0-8018-4987-9| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| location = Baltimore| postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]

==Essential and non-essential nutrients==

Nutrients are frequently categorized as essential or nonessential. Essential nutrients are unable to be synthesized internally (either at all, or in sufficient quantities), and so must be consumed by an organism from its environment.[tpl]cite book|author1=John Griffith Vaughan|author2=Catherine Geissler|author3=Barbara Nicholson|coauthors=Elisabeth Dowle, Elizabeth Rice|title=The new Oxford book of food plants|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UdKxFcen8zgC&pg=PA212|accessdate=13 October 2010|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-954946-7|pages=212–[/tpl] Nonessential nutrients are those nutrients that can be made by the body, they may often also be absorbed from consumed food. The majority of animals ultimately derive their essential nutrients from plants, though some animals may consume mineral-based soils to supplement their diet.
For humans, these include essential fatty acids, essential amino acids, vitamins, and certain dietary minerals. Oxygen and water are also essential for human survival, but are generally not considered "food" when consumed in isolation.
Humans can derive energy from a wide variety of fats, carbohydrates, proteins, and ethanol, and can synthesize other needed amino acids from the essential nutrients.
Non-essential substances within foods can still have a significant impact on health, whether beneficial or toxic. For example, most dietary fiber is not absorbed by the human digestive tract, but is important in digestion and absorption of otherwise harmful substances. Interest has recently increased in phytochemicals, which include many non-essential substances which may have health benefits.

==Deficiencies and toxicity==

An inadequate amount of a nutrient is a deficiency. Deficiencies can be due to a number of causes including inadequacy in nutrient intake called dietary deficiency, or conditions that interfere with the utilization of a nutrient within an organism.[tpl]cite book|author=Audrey H. Ensminger|title=Foods & nutrition encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XMA9gYIj-C4C&pg=PA527|accessdate=13 October 2010|year=1994|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-8980-1|pages=527–[/tpl]  Some of the conditions that can interfere with nutrient utilization include problems with nutrient absorption, substances that cause a greater than normal need for a nutrient, conditions that cause nutrient destruction, and conditions that cause greater nutrient excretion.
Nutrient toxicity occurs when an excess of a nutrient does harm to an organism.
In plants five types of deficiency or toxicity symptoms are common:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/BotanicalSciences/PlantHormones/EssentialPlant/EssentialPlant.htm |title=Essential Plant Nutrients |publisher=Cartage.org.lb |accessdate=2012-10-17[/tpl]
Oversupply of plant nutrients in the environment can cause excessive plant and algae growth. Eutrophication, as this process is called, may cause imbalances in population numbers and other nutrients that can be harmful to certain species. For example, an algal bloom can deplete the oxygen available for fish to breathe. Causes include water pollution from sewage or runoff from farms (carrying excess agricultural fertilizer). Nitrogen and phosphorus are most commonly the limiting factor in growth, and thus the most likely to trigger eutrophication when introduced artificially.
