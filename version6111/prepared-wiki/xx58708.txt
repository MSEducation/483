Princess Masako: Prisoner of the Chrysanthemum Throne, pp.136.
Despite the Imperial Household Agency's disapproval of Masako, and despite Masako's traveling to Oxford's Balliol College for the next two years, Naruhito remained interested in Masako. He would go on to propose to her three times before the Imperial Palace announced their engagement on 19 January 1993. The wedding would take place on June 9 the same year at the Imperial Shinto Hall in Tokyo before 800 invited guests, including many of Europe's heads of state and royalty, and an estimated media audience of 500 million people around the world.
After the wedding the couple moved into the Tōgū Palace, on the Akasaka Estate in Minato, Tokyo.
By the time of their marriage, Naruhito's grandfather Emperor Shōwa had died and so on 23 February 1991 Naruhito was invested as the Crown Prince with the title [tpl]nihongo|Prince Hiro|浩宮 |Hiro-no-miya[/tpl]Kunaicho.go.jp, the Imperial Household Agency website, retrieved 4 December 2008

====Succession controversy====

The Crown Prince and Crown Princess have one daughter from their marriage:
Aiko's birth, which occurred more than eight years after their marriage, sparked lively debate in Japan about whether the Imperial Household Law should be changed from that of agnatic primogeniture to cognatic or absolute primogeniture, which would allow a woman to ascend to the Chrysanthemum Throne.
In 2005, a government-appointed panel of experts recommended that the Imperial succession law be amended to permit Aiko to rule in her own right, and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi pledged his support.  However, the proposal was dropped following the birth of Hisahito, the Emperor's first grandson and Aiko's first cousin.
