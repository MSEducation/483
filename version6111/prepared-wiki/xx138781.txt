==Achievements==

Ridler was born in Newport, Monmouthshire.  He was one of the Welsh players who showed promise during the 1970s by winning the 1973 CIU (Club and Institute Union) Individual and the 1977 Warwickshire Open. He reached the semi-finals of the 1977 Winmau World Masters and was runner-up in the 1979 British Gold Cup (to John Lowe) and British Open pairs in 1980. 
However, as darts began to become more popular during the 1980s, Ridler faded from the scene and wasn't able to make an impact on the game. He only made one appearance at the World Championship in the 1983 event and won his first round match against the Dane, Finn Jensen but was defeated in the second round by Dave Whitcombe.
Ridler's first comeback in 1997 saw him reaching the last 32 of the revived News of the World Darts Championship and also reaching the last 16 of the World Matchplay. The last event in which he featured in the later stages was at a PDC UK Open regional qualifier in 2006 when he lost in the early stages to Andy Hamilton.
Ridler played with an unusual throwing action which saw him throw his darts almost from the tip of his nose. Ridler's son, Tony had a darts career from 2004 to 2006, which saw him winning the category 1 WDF-run Welsh Open.
