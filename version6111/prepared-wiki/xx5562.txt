==History==

Kool Keith began his rap career with the group Ultramagnetic MCs. After the release of their influential 1988 album Critical Beatdown, Thornton was reportedly institutionalized in Bellevue Hospital Center.[tpl]cite book |last= |first= |editor=Brackett, Nathan; Hoard, Christian |title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide |chapter=Kool Keith |chapterurl=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/koolkeith/biography |edition=fourth edition |year=2004 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 |pages=466–467 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Cooper |first=Sean |editor= |others= |title=All Music Guide to Hip-Hop: The Definitive Guide to Rap & Hip-hop |year=2003 |isbn=0-87930-759-5 |publisher=Backbeat Books |pages=267–268 |chapter=Kool Keith |chapterurl=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p200714|pure_url=yes[/tpl] [/tpl] However, he later said that the idea that he was institutionalized came from a flippant remark made during a stressful interview, and he never expected the story to become so well known.[tpl]cite web|last=Downs |first=David|title=Kool Keith and KutMasta Kurt|publisher=The A.V.

After continuing with Ultramagnetic for two more albums (1992's Funk Your Head Up and 1993's The Four Horsemen), Thornton released his first notable solo single, "Earth People," in 1995, under the name Dr. Octagon. This was followed by the release of Dr. Octagonecologyst the following year. The album's production by Dan the Automator and Kutmasta Kurt, with scratching by DJ Qbert was acclaimed by critics, and the album was released nationally by DreamWorks Records in 1997, after an initial release on the smaller Bulk Recordings label (as, simply, Dr. Octagon)a year prior. DreamWorks also issued an instrumental version of the album, titled Instrumentalyst (Octagon Beats). Thornton followed the album with Sex Style in 1997, under the name Kool Keith.
In 1996, Thornton collaborated with Tim Dog for the single "The Industry is Wack," performing under the name Ultra—the album Big Time soon followed. In 1999, he released the album First Come, First Served under the name "Dr. Dooom", in which the album's main character killed off Dr. Octagon on the album's opening track. The same year, on August 10, 1999, Thornton released Black Elvis/Lost in Space. It peaked at #10 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, #74 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #180 on the Billboard 200,[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r425836|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Charts and awards Black Elvis/Lost in Space |accessdate=2008-09-08 |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] and stands as Thornton's most commercially-successful project to date.

Thornton's lyrics are particularly dense, and he is a master of internal rhyme. His extensive use of internal rhyme predates Eminem and other artists who have embraced this style.
