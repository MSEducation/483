==Career==

In 2006 he stepped up to Formula racing, starting in Formula Renault he becomes the top rookie in the Italian Formula Renault and also gaining experience in Eurocup Formula Renault. The biggest challenge of his career was in 2007, when he graduated to the prestigious Formula Three Euroseries, winning 2 races overall en route to his rookie title. He dominated the early stages of the 2008 Formula Three Euroseries season, finishing in the top four of the first eight races of the championship including a win at Pau to lead by 15 points over his rivals. However, his season tailed off dramatically, scoring only 9.5 points from four points-scoring finishes over the final 12 races. Despite this, he managed to finish second in the championship just 2.5 points ahead of third place Jules Bianchi. Mortara moved up to the GP2 Asia Series during the 2008–09 GP2 Asia Series, replacing Euroseries rival Renger van der Zande at Trust Team Arden from the third round onwards.[tpl]cite news| title =Mortara signs for Arden| publisher =autosport.com| url =http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/72920| date =2009-01-21 | accessdate =2009-01-21[/tpl] In his first race, Mortara managed to finish third – the first points-scoring finish by an Arden car in this season's championship.
