According to the geographer Pausanias, the Arcadians claimed that battle took place "not at Pellene in Thrace", but in  the plain of Megalopolis where "rises up fire".Pausanias, 8.29.1. Another tradition apparently placed the battle at Tartessus in Spain.Scholiast A on Iliad 8.479 (Brown, p. 125). Diodorus Siculus presents a war with multiple battles, with one at Pallene, one on the Phlegraean Fields, and one on Crete.Diodorus Siculus, 4.15.1, 4.21.5–7, 5.71.2–6. Strabo mentions an account of Heracles battling Giants at Phanagoria a Greek colony on the shores of the Black Sea.Strabo, 11.2.10. Even when, as in Apollodorus, the battle starts at one place, Individual battles between Giant and god might range farther a field, with Enceladus buried beneath Sicily, and Polybotes under Nisyros (or Kos).
The presence of volcanic phenomena, and the discovery of the fossilized bones of large extinct animals throughout these locations suggest themselves as explanations for why such sites became associated with the Giants.Apollodorus 1.6.1 note 3; Frazer, note to Pausanias 8.29.1 "the legendary battle of the gods and the giants" pp. 314–315; Mayor, p. 197 ff.; Pausanias, 8.32.5.

===In art===

====Sixth century BC====

From the sixth century BC onwards, the Gigantomachy was a popular and important theme in Greek art. Over six hundred surviving examples are cataloged in the Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae (LIMC).Schefold, p. 51, p. 64; Ogden, p. 92; See also Vian 1951; 1952; Morford, p. 72.
The Gigantomachy was depicted on the new peplos (robe) presented to Athena on the Acropolis as part of the Panathenaic festival celebrating her victory over the Giants, a practice dating from perhaps as early as the second millennium BC.Barber 1992, pp. 103–117; Barber 1991, pp. 380–381; Schefold, p. 55; Simon, p. 23; Euripides, Hecuba, 466, Iphigenia in Tauris 221–224; Aristophanes, The Knights 565; Plato, Euthyphro 6b–c. Under the assumption that early depictions of Zeus battling single snake-footed creatures represent his battle with Typhon, the earliest extant representations of Gigantes are found on votive pinakes from Corinth and Eleusis, and Attic Black-figure pots, dating from the second quarter of the 6th cectury BC.Gantz, p. 450; Moore, p. 21. 
Though all the early Attic vases are fragmentary, many common features in their depictions of the Gigantomachy can be ascertained, suggesting that a common model was used as a prototype, possibly Athena's peplos.Gantz, pp 450–451; Moore, p. 21;  Schefold, p. 55, 57; Beazley,  pp. 38–39; Akropolis 607 Lydos dinos LIMC Gigantes 105; Akropolis 1632 LIMC Gigantes 110; Akropolis 2134 LIMC Gigantes 106; Akropolis 2211 LIMC Gigantes 104; Getty 81.AE.211 LIMC Gigantes 171. These vases depict large battles, including most Olympians, with a central group containing Zeus, Heracles and Athena attacking Giants to the right.Rightward was conventionally the "direction of victory", Schefold, p. 62. Zeus mounts a chariot brandishing his thunderbolt in his right hand, Heracles, in the chariot, bends forward with drawn bow and left foot on the chariot pole, Athena, beside the chariot, strides forward toward one or two Giants, and the four chariot horses trample a fallen Giant. In three early examples, Gaia also appears in the central group, shielded behind Herakles, apparently pleading to Zeus to spare her children.
On either side of the central group are found the rest of the gods engaged in combat with particular Giants. While the gods can be identified by characteristic features, for example Hermes with his hat (petasos) and Dionysus his ivy crown, the Giants are not individually characterized and are only identified by name.Schefold, pp. 56–57; Gantz p. 451; Moore, p. 21 The fragments of one vase from this early period name five Giants:  Pankrates against Heracles,Moore, p. 28. Polybotes against Zeus,Moore, pp. 30–31. Oranion against Dionysus,Moore, p. 32. Euboios and Euphorbos fallenMoore, pp. 34–36. and EphialtesMoore, pp. 34–35. (Getty 81.AE.211). Also named, on two other of these early vases, are Aristaios battling Hephaestus (Akropolis 607), and Eurymedon and (again) Ephialtes (Akropolis 2134). An amphora from Caere from later in the sixth century, gives the names of more Giants: Hyperbios and Agasthenes (along with Ephialtes) fighting Zeus, Harpolykos against Hera, Enceladus against Athena and (again) Polybotes, who in this case battles Poseidon (with trident) holding Nisyros on his shoulder (Louvre E732).Gantz, p. 451; Moore, p. 39. This motif of Poseidon holding the island of Nisyros, ready to hurl it at his opponent, is another common feature of these early Gigantomachies.Gantz, p. 453; Moore, p. 32.
The Gigantomachy was also a popular theme in late sixth century sculpture. The most comprehensive treatment is found on the north frieze of the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi (c. 530–525 BC), with more than thirty figures. From left to right, these included Hephaestus (with bellows), two females fighting two Giants, a male (probably Dionysus) striding toward an advancing Giant, a female in a chariot drawn by lions which are attacking a fleeing Giant, the archers Apollo and Artemis, a fleeing Giant (Kantharos?), the Giant Ephialtes lying on the ground, and a group of three Giants opposing Apollo and Artemis. Next comes a missing central section presumably containing Zeus, and possibly Heracles, with chariot (only parts of a team of horses remain). To the right of this comes a female (Hera?) stabbing her spear at a fallen Giant (Porphyrion?), Athena fighting two Giants, a male (Ares?) stepping over the fallen Astartas to attack Biatas and another Giant, and Hermes against two Giants. Then follows a gap which probably contained Poseidon, and finally four more figures on the far right.Gantz, pp. 451–452; Schefold, pp. 59–62; Morford, p. 73; Drawing: J.Boardman, Greek Sculpture Archaic Period fig.212.1; Perseus: Delphi, Siphnian Treasury Frieze--North (Sculpture); LIMC Gigantes 2.
The Gigantomachy also appeared on several other late sixth century buildings, including the west pediment of the Alkmeonid Temple of Apollo at Delphi, the pediment of the Megarian Treasury at Olympia, the east pediment of the Old Temple of Athena on the Acropolis at Athens, and the metopes of Temple F at Selinous.Gantz, p. 452. For the Temple of Apollo see: Schefold, p 64; Shapiro, p. 247; Stewart, pp. 86–87; Euripides, Ion 205–218; LIMC Gigantes 3. For the Megarian Treasury see: Pollitt 1990, pp. 22–23; Pausanias, 6.19.12–14; Frazer, note to Pausanias 6.19.12 "The people of Megara — built a treasury" pp 65–67, note to 6.19.13 "In the gable — is wrought in relief the war of the giants" pp 67–69; ASCA Digital Collections, Megarian Treasury.

====Fifth century BC====

The theme continued to be popular in the fifth century BC. A particularly fine example is found on a Red-figure cup (c. 490–485 BC) by the Brygos Painter (Berlin:Ch F2293). On one side of the cup is the same central group of gods (minus Gaia) as described above: Zeus wielding his thunderbolt, stepping into a quadriga, Heracles with lion skin (behind the chariot rather than in it) drawing his (unseen) bow, and ahead Athena thrusting her spear into a fallen Giant. On the other side are Hephaestus flinging flaming missiles of red-hot metal from two pairs of tongs, Poseidon, with Nisyros on his shoulder, stabbing a fallen Giant with his trident, and Hermes with his petasos hanging in back of his head, attacking another fallen Giant. None of the Giants are named.Cohen, pp. 177–178; Gantz p. 452.
Phidias used the theme for the metopes of the east facade of the Parthenon (c. 445 BC) and for the interior of the shield of Athena Parthenos.For the Parthenon Gigantomachy metopes see Schwab, pp. 168–173, for the statue of Athena see Lapatin, pp. 262–263, for both see Kleiner, pp. 136—137. Phidias' work perhaps marks the beginning of a change in the way the Giants are presented. While previously the Giants had been portrayed as typical hoplite warriors armed with the usual helmets, shields and spears, in the later part of the fifth century the Giants begin to be depicted as less handsome in appearance, primitive and wild, clothed in animal skins or naked, often without armor, and using boulders as weapons.Dwyer, p. 295; Gantz, pp. 446, 447, 452–453; Hard, p. 90. For an example of a particularly "handsome" Giant see Schefold, p. 67: London E 8 LIMC Gigantes 365 image 1/2, for Giants with animal skins fighting with boulders see a calyx-krater from Ruvo, c. 400: Naples H2883 LIMC Gigantes 316 image 3/5. A series of Red-figured pots from c. 400 BC, which may have used Phidas' shield of Athena Parthenos as their model, show the Olympians fighting from above and the Giants fighting with large stones from below.Robertson, pp. 106–107; Dwyer, p. 295; see for example neck amphora c. 400 BC: Lourve S1677 LIMC Gigantes 322, Louvre.

====Fourth century BC and later====

With the beginning of the fourth century BC comes the first portrayal of the Giants as anything other than fully human in form, with legs that become coiled serpents with snake heads at the end. This motif becomes the standard for the rest of antiquity, culminating in the Gigantomachy frieze of the second century BC Pergamon Altar, where the theme receives its most extensive treatment, with around a hundred figures.Ogden, p. 83,  Gantz, p. 453; Berlin:PM VI 3375 LIMC Gigantes 389; Kleiner, pp. 155–156; Pergamon Altar LIMC Gigantes 24.

==Symbolism, meaning and interpretations==

Tales of "giants" buried beneath the ground may have arisen as a result of the discovery of the fossilized bones of large extinct animals.For a comprehensive treatment of this see Mayor; see also Pausanias, 8.32.5; Apollodorus 1.6.1 note 3; Frazer, note to Pausanias 8.29.1 "the legendary battle of the gods and the giants" pp. 314–315;   Such tales were probably used as a way to explain volcanic and seismic phenomenon.See for example Philostratus, Life of Apollonius of Tyana 5.16; Philostratus the Elder, Imagines 2.17.5; Claudian, Rape of Proserpine 1.154–159; Durling, p. 495, note to Canto 31.108 "Ephialtes suddenly shook himself"; Lemprière p. 456 "MYCŎNOS"; Andrews, p. 81. The myth of the Gigantomachy (and the Titanomachy) may have arisen as a way of representing the triumph of the imported gods of the invading Greek speaking peoples from the north (c. 2000 BC) over the gods of the existing peoples of the Greek peninsula.Morford, pp. 82–83.
For the Greeks, the Gigantomachy represented a victory for order over chaos. The victory of the divine order and rationalism of the Olympian gods over the discord and excessive violence of the earth-born chthonic Giants. More specifically, for sixth and fifth century BC Greeks, it represented a victory for civilization over barbarism, and as such was used by Phidias on the metopes of the Parthenon and the shield of Athena Parthenos to symbolize the victory of the Athenians over the Persians. Later the Attalids similarly used the Gigantomachy on the Pergamon Altar to symbolize their victory over the Galatians of Asia Minor.Morford, p. 72; Schefold, p. 50; Kleiner, p. 118, p. 136, p. 156; Lyne, p. 50; Castriota, p. 139; Dwyer, p. 295.
The Giants attempt to overthrow the Olympians also represented the ultimate example of hybris, with the gods themselves punishing the Giants for their arrogant challenge to the god's divine authority.Castriota, p. 139; Dwyer, p. 295;  Gale, p. 121; Wilkinson, p. 142; Cairns, p. 310; Commager, pp. 119, 199. The Gigantomachy can also be seen as a continuation of the struggle between Gaia (Mother Earth) and Uranus (Father Sky), and thus as part of the primal opposition between female and male.Schefold, p. 51. Plato compares the Gigantomachy to a philosophical dispute about existence, wherein the materialist philosophers, who believe that only physical things exist, like the Giants, wish to "drag down everything from heaven and the invisible to earth".Plato, Sophist 246a–c; Chaudhuri, pp.60–61.
In Latin literature—in which the Giants, the Titans, Typhon, and the Aloadae, are all often conflated—Gigantomachy imagery is a frequent occurrence.Lovatt, pp. 115 ff.. Cicero, while urging the acceptance of aging and death as natural and inevitable, allegorizes the Gigantomachy as "fighting against Nature".Cicero, De Senectute 5; Powell, p. 110 "Gigantum modo bellare"; Chaudhuri, p. 7 note 22. The rationalist Epicurean poet Lucretius, for whom such things as lightning, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions had natural rather than divine causes, in celebrating the victory of philosophy over mythology and superstition, of science and reason over traditional religious belief, uses the Gigantomachy to symbolize Epicurus storming heaven; and so—in a reversal of their usual meaning—represents the Giants as heroic rebels against the tyranny of Olympus.Chaudhuri, pp. 58–63; Hardie 2007, p. 116; Gale, pp. 120–121, p. 140; Lucretius, De Rerum Natura 1.62–79, 5.110–125. Virgil—reversing Lucretius' reversal— restores the conventional meaning, making the Giants once again enemies of order and civilization.Gale, pp. 140–141; Gee, pp. 56–57. Horace makes use of this same meaning to symbolize the victory of Augustus at the Battle of Actium as a victory for the civilized West over the barbaric East.Lyne, pp. 52–54, pp. 167–168; Commager, p. 199; Horace, Odes  3.4.42 ff..
Ovid, in his Metamorphoses, after describing mankind's moral decline, as it successively descended through the ages of gold, silver, bronze and iron, presents the Gigantomachy as a part of that same descent from natural order into chaos.Wheeler, pp. 23–26; Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.151–162. Lucan, in his Pharsalia, which contains many Gigantomachy references,Hardie 2014, p. 101. makes the Gorgon's gaze turn the Giants into mountains.Dinter, p. 296; Lucan, Pharsalia 9.654–658. Valerius Flaccus, in his Argonautica, makes frequent use of Gigantomachy imagery, with the Argo (the world's first ship) constituting a Gigantomachy-like offense against natural law, and an example of hubristic excess.Zissos, pp. 79 ff..
Claudian, the fifth-century AD court poet of emperor Honorius, composed a Gigantomachia that viewed the battle as a metaphor for vast geomorphic change: "The puissant company of the giants confounds all differences between things; islands abandon the deep; mountains lie hidden in the sea. Many a river is left dry or has altered its ancient course....robbed of her mountains Earth sank into level plains, parted among her own sons."Mayor, p. 195;  Claudian, Gigantomachia 60–72.
