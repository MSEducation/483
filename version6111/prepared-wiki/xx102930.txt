The King's School, Rochester is an independent school in Rochester, Kent. It is a cathedral school, and being part of the foundation of Rochester Cathedral, the Dean of Rochester Cathedral serves as the chair of the school's governing body. It is the second-oldest school in the world, having been founded in 604 AD.

==History==

The cathedral school at Rochester was founded in 604 AD, at the same time as the cathedral, and was refounded by Henry VIII in 1541 during the Protestant Reformation, when the monastery at Rochester was dissolved. It is the second oldest school in the United Kingdom after The King's School Canterbury. The current King's Principal is Mr Jeremy Walker, who also acts as the Senior School Headmaster, Mr Roger Overend as the Preparatory School Headmaster and Mrs Sarah Skillen as the Pre-Preparatory School Headmistress.Note that Mr Jeremy Walker took over as Principal from Dr Ian Walker in 2012, the same surnames have caused confusion. The longest serving teacher at the school in present time is Mr Brian Richter, the international languages teacher (teaching Russian, German and French), has been teaching at the school for 32 years.

==Site==

The school is housed in a variety of buildings around the Cathedral precincts including Main School, Davies Court, Mackean House, the School Hall and Old St. Margaret's, an ex workhouse, which houses the Maths and Classics Departments).
The Preparatory School is situated close-by and is predominantly a campus of buildings surrounding the Paddock, which is a space used as a cricket/rugby field.  A larger sports ground, commonly known as "the Alps" is located about a mile away.
The School's administrative offices are housed in Satis House, which reputedly gained its name from a comment by Queen Elizabeth I who stayed there as a guest of its owner, Richard Watts. As she left, Watts asked the queen if she had been comfortable during her stay. She replied: "satis", which in translation means "enough" or "satisfactory".
In 2011 the school bought the Stirling Center and in September 2013, it re-opened as the King's Rochester Sports center. It is now open to students and the public.
The school also has a boat house in Maidstone, south of the Allington Lock. It is used for Rowing and Kayaking. The building, known to school pupils as "The Boat House", houses 18 rowing boats (five skulls (or singles), two 'tubs', three doubles, one wooden double, three wooden quads, two cox-less quads, one coxed quad and one heavy weight double) downstairs and has a sitting area, toilets and an area where the boats are fixed (usually three or four boats are there). The Boat House also holds five large canoes, a new sport at King's.   

==The Houses==

Within the Senior School there are currently five houses: 
In the Preparatory school, there are currently four houses, though there were previously six:
St. Williams
St. Nicholas
St. Andrews
St. Peters 
(The now defunct fifth and sixth houses were St. Margarets and St. Justus)
In pre-prep the houses are Tigers (Red), Zebra (Blue), Hippos (Green) or Giraffes (Yellow). Zebra used to be called 'Snakes', but the children got scared, so they subsequently changed it to 'Zebra' house.King's Rochester: Pre-prep Pastoral Care

==Order of St. Justus==

The Order of St Justus, which is incorporated within England’s Rochester Cathedral Foundation, and governed by former Head Master of King's School Rochester Dr. Ian Walker, is a foundation set up with the intention to build a King’s University of Bangladesh and a King’s School, Dhaka, in Bangladesh.  Links have been established and land identified for the site, and the school is in the early stages of possible development.
