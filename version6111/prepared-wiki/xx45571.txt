[[Nuclear magneton]]

CATEGORIES: Magnetism

The nuclear magneton (symbol Î¼N), is a physical constant of magnetic moment, defined in SI units by:
and in Gaussian CGS units by:
where:
In SI units, its value is approximately: 
In Gaussian CGS units, its value can be given in convenient units as
The nuclear magneton is the natural unit for expressing magnetic dipole moments of heavy particles such as nucleons and atomic nuclei. On the contrary, the dipole moment of the electron, which is much higher as a consequence of much higher charge-to-mass ratio, is usually expressed in corresponding units of the Bohr magneton.
