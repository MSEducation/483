Nanook of the North (also known as Nanook of the North: A Story Of Life and Love In the Actual Arctic) is a 1922 silent documentary film by Robert J. Flaherty, contaminated by docudrama, at a time when separating films into documentary and drama did not yet exist.
In the tradition of what would later be called salvage ethnography, Flaherty captured the struggles of the Inuk man named Nanook and his family in the Canadian Arctic. The film is considered the first feature-length documentary. Some have criticized Flaherty for staging several sequences,[tpl]cite web |title=Essay by Dean W. Duncan |work=Criterion Collection |url=http://www.criterion.com/asp/release.asp?id=33&eid=49&section=essay |accessdate=May 18, 2007[/tpl] but the film is generally viewed as standing "alone in its stark regard for the courage and ingenuity of its heroes."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oneworldmagazine.org/seek/nanook/main.htm|title=Robert Flaherty's "Nanook of the North"|author=Silver, Alain|publisher=One World Magazine[/tpl]
In 1989, this film was one of the first 25 films to be selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Plot==

The documentary follows the lives of an Inuk, Nanook, and his family as they travel, search for food, and trade in northern Quebec, Canada. Nanook, his wife, Nyla, and their baby, Cunayou, are introduced as fearless heroes who endure rigors "no other race" could survive.

==Production==

===Development===

In 1910, Flaherty was hired as an explorer and prospector along the Hudson Bay for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Learning about the lands and people there, Flaherty decided to bring a camera with him on his third expedition in 1913, but knowing nothing about film, Flaherty took a three-week course on cinematography in Rochester, New York.[tpl]cite book|last=Barnouw|first=Eri|title=Documentary:A History of the Non-Fiction Film|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=33–35[/tpl]

===Filming===

Using a Bell & Howell camera, a portable developing and printing machine, and some lighting equipment, Flaherty spent 1914 and 1915 shooting hours of film of Eskimo life. By 1916, Flaherty had enough footage that he began test screenings and was met with wide enthusiasm. However, in 1916, Flaherty dropped a cigarette onto the original camera negative (which was highly flammable nitrate stock) and lost 30,000 feet of film.[tpl]cite book|last=Barnouw|first=Erik|title=Documentary:A History of the Non-Fiction Film|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=33–35[/tpl] With his first attempt ruined, Flaherty decided to not only return for new footage, but also to refocus the film on one Eskimo family as he felt his earlier footage was too much of travelogue. Spending four years raising money, Flaherty was eventually funded by French fur company Revillon Frères and returned to the North and shot from August 1920 to August 1921. As a main character, Flaherty chose the celebrated hunter of the Itivimuit tribe, Allakariallak. The full collaboration of the Eskimos was key to Flaherty's success as the Eskimos were his film crew and many of them knew his camera better than he did.[tpl]cite book|pages=34–36[/tpl]

==Controversies==

Flaherty has been criticized for deceptively portraying staged events as reality.[tpl]cite web | title=Richard Leacock Essay (Flaherty's Cameraman in the '40's and later MIT professor of film studies) | url=http://www.afana.org/leacockessays.htm [/tpl] "Nanook" was in fact named Allakariallak ([tpl]IPA-iu|al.la.ka.ɢi.al.lak|pron[/tpl]), while the "wife" shown in the film was not really his wife. According to Charles Nayoumealuk, who was interviewed in Nanook Revisited (1988), "the two women in Nanook - Nyla (Alice ? Nuvalinga) and Cunayou (whose real name we do not know) were not Allakariallak's wives, but were in fact common-law wives of Flaherty."[tpl]cite book |title=Defamiliarizing the aboriginal: cultural practices and decolonization in Canada |author= Julia Emberley |page=86 (citing Fatimah Tobing Rony, Taxidermy and Romantic Ethnography: Robert Flaherty's Nanook of the North)[/tpl] And although Allakariallak normally used a gun when hunting, Flaherty encouraged him to hunt after the fashion of his recent ancestors in order to capture the way the Inuit lived before European influence. On the other hand, while Flaherty made his Inuit actors use spears instead of guns during the walrus and seal hunts, the prey shown in the film were genuine, wild animals. Flaherty also exaggerated the peril to Inuit hunters with his claim, often repeated, that Allakariallak had died of starvation two years after the film was completed, whereas in fact he died at home, likely of tuberculosis.Pamela R.

===Building of the igloo===

The building of the igloo is one of the most celebrated sequences in the film, but interior photography presented a problem. Building an igloo large enough for a camera to enter resulted in the dome collapsing, and when they finally succeeded in making the igloo it was too dark for photography. Instead, the images of the inside of the igloo in the film were actually shot in a special three-walled igloo for Flaherty's bulky camera so that there would be enough light for it to capture interior shots.[tpl]cite book|page=36[/tpl]

===Visit to the trade post of the white man===

Another scene that is much discussed is the visit to the "Trade Post of the White Man." In this scene, Nanook and his family arrive in a kayak at the trading post and one family member after another emerge from a small kayak, akin to a clown car at the circus. Going to trade his hunt from the year, including foxes, seals and polar bears, Nanook comes in contact with the white man and there is a funny interaction as the two cultures meet. The trader plays music on a gramophone and tries to explain how a man 'cans' his voice. Bending forward and staring at the machine, Nanook puts his ear closer as the trader cranks the mechanism again. The trader removes the record and hands it to Nanook who at first peers at it and then puts it in his mouth and bites it. The scene is meant to be a comical one as the audience laughs at the naivete of Nanook and people isolated from Western culture. In truth, the scene was entirely scripted and Nanook knew what a gramophone was.[tpl]cite book|last=Rothman|first=William|title=Documentary Film Classics|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=9–11[/tpl]

===Hunting of the walrus===

It has been pointed out that in the 1920s when Nanook was filmed, the Inuit had already begun integrating the use of Western clothing and were utilizing rifles to hunt rather than the harpoon;[tpl]cite web|last=Duncan|first=Dean W.|title=Nanook of the North|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/42-nanook-of-the-north|publisher=Criterion Collection|accessdate=3 April 2012[/tpl] but this does not negate that the Inuit knew how to make traditional clothing from animals found in their environment, and could still fashion traditional weapons; and were perfectly free to utilize them if found to be preferable for a given situation.
[tpl]quote|The film is not technically sophisticated; how could it be, with one camera, no lights, freezing cold, and everyone equally at the mercy of nature? But it has an authenticity that prevails over any complaints that some of the sequences were staged. If you stage a walrus hunt, it still involves hunting a walrus, and the walrus hasn't seen the script. What shines through is the humanity and optimism of the Inuit.|Roger Ebert|[tpl]cite news|title=Nanook of the North (1922)|author=Ebert, Roger|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050925/REVIEWS08/509250301|work=Chicago Sun Times|date=2005-09-25[/tpl][/tpl]
Flaherty defended his work by stating that a filmmaker must often distort a thing to catch its true spirit. Later filmmakers have pointed out that the only cameras available to Flaherty at the time were both large and immobile, making it impossible to effectively capture most interior shots or unstructured exterior scenes without significantly modifying the environment and subject action.

==Reception==

As the first nonfiction work of its scale, Nanook of the North was ground-breaking cinema. It captured many authentic details of a culture little-known to outsiders, and was filmed in a remote location. Hailed almost unanimously by critics, the film was a box office success in the United States and abroad. In the following years, many others would try to follow in Flaherty's success with "primitive peoples" films.[tpl]cite book|pages=47–48[/tpl]  In 2005, film critic Roger Ebert described the film's central figure, Nanook, as "one of the most vital and unforgettable human beings ever recorded on film."

==Legacy==

At the time, few documentaries had been filmed and there was little precedent to guide Flaherty's work. Since Flaherty's time both staging action and attempting to steer documentary action have come to be considered unethical amongst cinéma vérité purists, because they believe such reenactments deceive the audience.
In its earliest years (approx. 1895–1902), film production was dominated by actualities, short pictures of real people in real places. Robert Flaherty’s great innovation was simply to combine the two forms of actuality, infusing the exotic journey with the details of indigenous work and play and life.[tpl]cite web|last=Duncan|first=Dean|title=Nanook of the North|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/42-nanook-of-the-north|publisher=Criterion Collection|accessdate=3 April 2012[/tpl]

==Home media==
