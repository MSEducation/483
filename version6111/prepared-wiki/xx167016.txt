"To Keep My Love Alive" is a 1943 popular song composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Lorenz Hart for the musical A Connecticut Yankee (1927), where it was introduced by Vivienne Segal. It was written especially for Segal's appearance in the 1943 revival of A Connecticut Yankee. (R&H Theatricals background) It was the last song that Hart wrote before his death from pneumonia.
The song outlines the many ways the singer "bumped off" her husbands in order to avoid being unfaithful to any of them. Some of her methods include arsenic poisoning, defenestration, stabbing, and appendectomy.
