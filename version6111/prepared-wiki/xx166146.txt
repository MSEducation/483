==History==

It was named after Lord Edward Gleichen in 1884.[tpl]cite news|last=Lindman|first=Doris|title=Siding #12 brings settlers west|url=http://virtual.strathmorestandard.com/doc/Strathmore-Standard/strathmorestandard_20100203/2010020301/12.html#12|accessdate=1 August 2013|newspaper=Strathmore Standard|date=3 February 2010[/tpl]   Gleichen was originally incorporated as a village on January 24, 1899 and then incorporated as a town on May 6, 1910.  After nearly 100 years as a municipality however, Gleichen dissolved to hamlet status under the jurisdiction of Wheatland County on March 31, 1998. 
During the formation of the province, Gleichen was large enough to have its own seat in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta (see Gleichen provincial electoral district).  Its population peaked at 668 according to the Canada 1921 Census.
Due to its proximity to the railroad, Gleichen was readily accessible to farmers and ranchers living in the area. Its mostly wooden structures however posed an increased risk of widespread fires.  After the community burned a second time in 1912, many of its residents moved elsewhere, mostly to Calgary.
