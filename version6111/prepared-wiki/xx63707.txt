[[Architecture of India]]

CATEGORIES: Indian architecture

Indian architecture has evolved through  various ages in different regions of the country.Apart from these natural and obvious evolution from the pre-historic and historic periods,evolution of Indian architecture was generally affected by the emergence and decay of great empires and dynasties in the sub-continent .

==Indus Valley Civilization (2700 BC-1700BC)==

The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was a Bronze Age civilization (2700–1700 BC; mature period 2600–1900 BC) that was located in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent, consisting of what is now mainly modern-day Pakistan and northwest India. Flourishing around the Indus River basin, the civilization primarily centred along the Indus and the Punjab region, extending into the Ghaggar-Hakra River valley and the Ganges-Yamuna Doab. Geographically, the civilization was spread over an area of some 1,260,000 km, making it the largest ancient civilization in the world.
The Indus Valley is one of the world's earliest urban civilizations, along with its contemporaries, Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. At its peak, the Indus Civilization may have had a population of well over five million. Inhabitants of the ancient Indus river valley developed new techniques in metallurgy and handicraft (carneol products, seal carving) and produced copper, bronze, lead, and tin. The civilization is noted for its cities built of brick, roadside drainage system, and multistoried houses. The baths and toilets system the cities had is acknowledged as one of the most advanced in the ancient world. The grid layout planning of the cities with roads at exact right angles is a modern system that was implemented in the cities of this particular civilization. The urban agglomeration and production scale of this particular civilization was unsurpassed at the time and for many future centuries.
The mature phase of this civilization is known as the Harappan Civilization, as the first of its cities to be unearthed was located at Harappa, excavated in the 1920s in what was at the time the Punjab province of British India (now in Pakistan). Excavation of Harappan sites have been ongoing since 1920, with important breakthroughs occurring as recently as 1999. To date, over 1,052 cities and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the Ghaggar-Hakra river and its tributaries. Among the settlements were the major urban centres of Harappa, Lothal, Mohenjo-daro (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Dholavira, Kalibanga, and Rakhigarhi.[tpl]-[/tpl]

==Post Maha Janapadas period (1500 BC—200 AD)==

The Buddhist stupa, a dome shaped monument, was used in India as a commemorative monument associated with storing sacred relics.Encyclopædia Britannica (2008), Pagoda. The stupa architecture was adopted in Southeast and East Asia, where it became prominent as a Buddhist monument used for enshrining sacred relics. Fortified cities with stūpas, viharas, and temples were constructed during the Maurya empire (c. 321–185 BC).Chandra (2008) Wooden architecture was popular and rock cut architecture became solidified. Guard rails—consisting of posts, crossbars, and a coping—became a feature of safety surrounding a stupa. Temples—build on elliptical, circular, quadrilateral, or apsidal plans—were constructed using brick and timber. The Indian gateway arches, the torana, reached East Asia with the spread of Buddhism.Encyclopædia Britannica (2008), torii Some scholars hold that torii derives from the torana gates at the Buddhist historic site of Sanchi (3rd century BC - 11th century AD).Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System (2001), torii.
Rock-cut stepwells in India date from 200-400 AD. Subsequently, the construction of wells at Dhank (550-625 AD) and stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850-950 AD) took place.Livingston & Beach, xxiii The city of Mohenjo-daro has wells which may be the predecessors of the step well. As many as 700 wells, constructed by 3rd millennium BC, have been discovered in just one section of the city, leading scholars to believe that 'cylindrical brick lined wells' were invented by the people of the Indus Valley Civilization.Livingstone & Beach, 19 Cave temples became prominent throughout western India, incorporating various unique features to give rise to cave architecture in places such as Ajanta and Ellora.
Walled and moated cities with large gates and multi-storied buildings which consistently used arched windows and doors are important features of the architecture during this period. The Indian emperor Ashoka (rule: 273—232 BC) established a chain of hospitals throughout the Mauryan empire by 230 BCE.Piercey & Scarborough (2008) One of the edicts of Ashoka (272—231 BC) reads: "Everywhere King Piyadasi (Asoka) erected two kinds of hospitals, hospitals for people and hospitals for animals. Where there were no healing herbs for people and animals, he ordered that they be bought and planted."See Stanley Finger (2001), Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function, Oxford University Press, p. 12, ISBN 0-19-514694-8. Buddhist architecture blended with Roman architecture and Hellenestic architecture to give rise to unique blends—such as the Greco-Buddhist school.Moffett et al., 75
Indian art and culture has absorbed extraneous impacts by varying degrees, and is much richer for this exposure. This cross fertilization between different art streams converging on the subcontinent produced new forms that, while retaining the essence of the past, succeeded in the integrating selected elements of the new influences. A long tradition of art and culture was already established well before the beginning of 20th century in India. Indian painting can be broadly divided into two categories—MURALS and MINIATURE.[tpl]-[/tpl]

==Early Common Era—High Middle Ages (200 AD—1200 AD)==

Universities—housing thousands of teachers and students—flourished at Nalanda and Valabhi between the 4th-8th centuries.Encyclopædia Britannica (2008), education, history of. South Indian temple architecture—visible as a distinct tradition during the 7th century AD—is described below:Encyclopædia Britannica (2008), South Indian temple architecture.
North Indian temples showed increased elevation of the wall and elaborate spire by the 10th century.Encyclopædia Britannica (2008), North Indian temple architecture. Richly decorated temples—including the complex at Khajuraho—were constructed in Central India. Indian traders brought Indian architecture to South east Asia through various trade routes. Grandeur of construction, beautiful sculptures, delicate carvings, high domes, gopuras and extensive courtyards were the features of temple architecture in India. Examples include the Lingaraj Temple at Bhubaneshwar in Odisha, Sun Temple at Konark in Odisha, Brihadishwara Temple at Thanjavur in  Tamil Nadu.

==Late Middle Ages (1100 AD—1526 AD)==

Vijayanagara Architecture of the period (1336 - 1565 AD) was a notable building style evolved by the Vijayanagar empire that ruled most of South India from their capital at Vijayanagara on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in present-day Karnataka.See Percy Brown in Sūryanātha Kāmat's A concise history of Karnataka: from pre-historic times to the present, p. 132. The architecture of the temples built during the reign of the Vijayanagara empire had elements of political authority.See Carla Sinopoli, Echoes of Empire: Vijayanagara and Historical Memory, Vijayanagara as Historical Memory, p. 26. This resulted in the creation of a distinctive imperial style of architecture which featured prominently not only in temples but also in administrative structures across the deccan.See Carla Sinopoli, The Political Economy of Craft Production: Crafting Empire in South India, C. 1350-1650, p. 209. The Vijayanagara style is a combination of the Chalukya, Hoysala, Pandya and Chola styles which evolved earlier in the centuries when these empires ruled and is characterised by a return to the simplistic and serene art of the past.See Percy Brown in Sūryanātha Kāmat's A concise history of Karnataka: from pre-historic times to the present, p. 182.
Hoysala architecture is the distinctive building style developed under the rule of the Hoysala Empire in the region historically known as Karnata, today's Karnataka, India, between the 11th and the 14th centuries.MSN Encarta (2008), Hoysala_Dynasty. Archived 2009-10-31. Large and small temples built during this era remain as examples of the Hoysala architectural style, including the Chennakesava Temple at Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu, and the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura. Other examples of fine Hoysala craftmanship are the temples at Belavadi, Amrithapura, and Nuggehalli. Study of the Hoysala architectural style has revealed a negligible Indo-Aryan influence while the impact of Southern Indian style is more distinct.See Percy Brown in Sūryanātha Kāmat's A concise history of Karnataka: from pre-historic times to the present, p. 134. A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to detail and skilled craftmanship. The temples of Belur and Halebidu are proposed UNESCO world heritage sites.The Hindu (2004), Belur for World Heritage Status. About 100 Hoysala temples survive today.Foekema, 16

==Sikhism(1526 AD-1857 AD)==

Mughal tombs of sandstone and marble show Persian influence.Encyclopædia Britannica (2008), Mughal architecture. The Red Fort at Agra (1565–74) and the walled city of Fatehpur Sikri (1569–74) are among the architectural achievements of this time—as is the Taj Mahal, built as a tomb for Queen Mumtaz Mahal by Shah Jahan (1628–58). Employing the double dome, the recessed archway, white marble and parks while stressing on symmetry and detail was visible during the reign of Shah Jahan.Encyclopædia Britannica (2008), Shāh Jahān period architecture. Quranic verses were described on the walls of the buildings. However, the depiction of any living being—an essential part of the pre-Islamic tradition of India—was forbidden under Islam. The Architecture during the Mughal Period has shown a very good blend of Indian style with the Iranian style.
Some scholars hold that cultural contact with Europe under Manuel I of Portugal (reign: 25 October 1495—13 December 1521) resulted in exchange of architectural influences.Lach, 57-62 Little literary evidence exists to confirm the Indian influence but some scholars have nonetheless suggested a possible relation based on proximity of architectural styles.

==Colonial Era (1500 AD—1947 AD)==

Under colonial rule, architecture became an emblem of power, designed to endorse the patron. Numerous outsiders invaded India and created architectural styles reflective of their ancestral and adopted homes. The European colonizers created architecture that symbolized their mission of conquest, dedicated to the state or religion.[tpl]cite book|last=Thapar|first=Bindia|title=Introduction to Indian Architecture|year=2004|publisher=Periplus Editions|location=Singapore|isbn=0-7946-0011-5|pages=122[/tpl]

===British Colonial Era: 1615 to 1947===

The British arrival in 1615 overthrew the Mughal empire. Britain reigned India for over three hundred years and their legacy still remains through building and infrastructure that populate their former colonies.name="Mughal Empure" group="The Mughal Empire">[tpl]cite book|last=JAFFAR|first=S.M|title=THE MUGHAL EMPIRE FROM BABAR TO AURANGZEB|year=1936|publisher=MUHAMMAD SADIQ KHAN|location=Peshawar City|id=OU_1 60252|pages=230[/tpl]

The staple of Madras was Fort St. George, a walled squared building adjacent to the beach. Surrounding the fort was White Town settlement of British and Indian area Black Town later to be called Georgetown.
Black Town described in 1855 as “the minor streets, occupied by the natives are numerous, irregular and of various dimensions. Many of them are extremely narrow and ill-ventilated…a hallow square, the rooms opening into a courtyard in the centre."''name=Metropolis group="The Indian Metropolis">[tpl]cite book|last=Evenson|first=Norma|title=The Indian Metropolis|year=1989|publisher=Yale University press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=0-300-04333-3|pages=2[/tpl]

===French: 1673 to 1954===

The French colonized a fishing village (Pondicherry) in Tamil Nadu and transformed it into a flourishing port-town. The town was built on the French grid pattern and features neat sectors and perpendicular streets and divided into two sectors, French Quarter (Ville Blanche) and the Indian quarter (Ville Noire). French styled villas were styled with long compounds and stately walls, lined houses with verandas, large French doors and grills.  Infrastructure such as banks, police station and Pondicherry International Port still hold the French presence.
To preserve Pondicherry an organization named INTACH was formed. Authorization is needed from INTACH, to annihilate any original French Architecture.name="Europe Arch" group="European Architecture in India 1750 - 1850">[tpl]cite book|last=Nilsson|first=Sten|title=European Architecture in India 1750 - 1850|year=1968|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-08225-4|pages=94–97[/tpl]

===Dutch: 1605 to 1825===

The Dutch entered India with the only interests of Trade in the early 17th Century. During their 200 years in India, they colonized Surat, Bharuch, Venrula, Ahmedabad, Malabar Coast, Kochi and Sadras.name="Asian Trade" group="Asian Trade">[tpl]cite web|last=Brief|first=History|title=Asian Trade|url=http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vaucher/Genealogy/Documents/Asia/EuropeanExploration.html#england|work=European Exploration|accessdate=14 October 2011[/tpl]
Surat – a Dutch factory in 1630’s
Bharuch: Trading Post of the Dutch East India Company had a Dutch cemetery.
Venrula: a warehouse was built for 3000 Guilders by Leendart Janszoons and a castle for the protection of the Dutch.
Ahmedabad: The Dutch cemetery lies on the bank of Kankaria lake. It holds a mix of Indian and European styled graves, with domed tombs, pyramids, walled and plain grave stones.
Malabar Coast Kochi:
The Dutch Palace (Mattancherry Palace) – The palace was originally built by the Portuguese, it fell into the hands of the Dutch when the Portuguese lost control of Kochi.
Dutch cemetery – The cemetery runs parallel to the beach and is the oldest European cemetery in India. It holds 104 tombs that visually narrate the Dutch influence in Architecture during the era. The cemetery is guarded by heavy walls and the entrance pillar still carries the original calligraphic inscription “1724”
David Hall – which was the residence of the famous Dutch Commander and Governor of Kochi, Adriaan van Reed lot Drakestein was built in 1695. The hall has been restored as a cultural centre and art café for young, visual and performing artists.

Thakur House – the Dutch built this bungalow overlooking the sea as a club.
Sadras – [tpl]convert|17|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from the rock cut temples of Mamallapuram is another Dutch settlement.
Pullicat – Pullicat lake 55 km north of Madras is a million years old and the second largest lagoon in India. It was the most important trading post of the Dutch. They built two cemeteries. One was ruined due to negligence and at the entrance is flanked by stone pillars, having 76 tombs.

===Portuguese: 1498 to 1961===

The Portuguese arrived as merchants in the 1498 and were more driven by a Catholic missionary zeal than gaining powers in India. The Portuguese gained a foothold in Goa and ruled for 400 years.name="Asian Trade" group="Asian Trade">[tpl]cite web|last=Brief|first=History|title=Asian Trade|url=http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vaucher/Genealogy/Documents/Asia/EuropeanExploration.html#england|work=European Exploration|accessdate=14 October 2011[/tpl]
Portuguese dominance in Goa still remains evident. Colonizers' missionary spirit built many magnificent cathedrals, churches, basilicas and seminaries.
The Basilica of Bom Jesus (Good Jesus), Old Goa, former capital during the Portuguese rule. The three storied Renaissance styled church was built of plaster and laterite in 1605, and holds the mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier. The interior is built in a Mosaic-Corinthian style and adorned with wood and gold leaf. The walls embrace old painting of saints as the floor is laid with pure white marble.name="Intro to Indian Architecture" group="Introduction to Indian Architecture">[tpl]cite book|last=Thapar|first=Bindia|title=Introduction to Indian Architecture|year=2004|publisher=Periplus Editions|location=Singapore|isbn=0-7946-0011-5|pages=124[/tpl]
The Portuguese - Catholic houses faced the street with unique large ornamental windows opening onto verendahs. Bold colours were painted on houses constructing distinct identity, allowing the sailors to recognize their houses from sea. The covered porches and verandas were designed for socializing contrary to the Hindu styled housing. Front doors were lined with columns, and railings were popular in embellishment.name="Temples of Goa" group="Temples of Goa">[tpl]cite book|last=Mankekar|first=Kamla|title=Temples of Goa|year=2004|publisher=Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt. of Ind|location=India|isbn=978-81-2301161-5|pages=99[/tpl]
The interior of Goan-Portuguese houses consisted of elaborate patterns created with tiles imported from Europe and a false ceiling installed of wood. The walls are painted with bright colours contrasting to the earthy coloured furniture.
The walls were made out of mud or laterite stone and coloured with vegetable and natural dyes. Gateposts and compound walls were craved with great detail.name="Temples of Goa" group="Temples of Goa">[tpl]cite book|last=Mankekar|first=Kamla|title=Temples of Goa|year=2004|publisher=Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt. of Ind|location=India|isbn=978-81-2301161-5|pages=17[/tpl]
Indian Architecture continued to flourish as they took influence from the colonies. Indian Architecture further shaped as they combined the colonial influences with traditional Architecture.

==Republic of India (1947 AD—present)==

In recent times there has been a movement of pendulum from rural areas to urban centres of industry, leading to price rise in property in various cities of India.See Raj Jadhav, p. 11 in Modern Traditions: Contemporary Architecture in India. Urban housing in India balances space constrictions and is aimed to serve the working class.Gast, 77 Growing awareness of ecology has influenced architecture in India during modern times.Gast, 119
Though old, this Eastern tradition has also incorporated modern values as India became a modern nation state.See Raj Jadhav, pp. 7-13 in Modecture of India' As the country became more integrated with the world's economy, traditional Vastu Shastra remains influential in India's architecture during the contemporary era. Climate responsive architecture has long been a feature of India's architecture but has been losing its significance as of late. Indian architecture reflects its various socio-cultural sensibilities which vary from region to region.See Raj Jadhav, 13 in Modern Traditions: Contemporary Architecture in India. Certain areas are traditionally held to be belonging to women. Villages in India have features such as courtyards, loggias, terraces and balconies. Calico, chintz, and palampore—of Indian origin—highlight the assimilation of Indian textiles in global interior design.Savage 2008 Roshandans, which are skylights-cum-ventilators, are a common feature in Indian homes, especially in North India.[tpl]Citation | title=India remembered | author=Thomas George Percival Spear, Margaret Spear | publisher=Orient Longman, 1981 | isbn=978-0-86131-265-8 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6vEtAAAAMAAJ | quote=...
