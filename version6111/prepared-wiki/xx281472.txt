Bahrain Tamarod (also spelled Bahrain Tamarrod; [tpl]lang-ar|تمرد البحرين[/tpl]; literally "Bahrain Rebellion"), also known as August 14 Rebellion, was a three-day protest campaign in Bahrain that began on 14 August 2013, the forty-second anniversary of Bahrain Independence Day and the two-and-a-half-year anniversary of the Bahraini uprising. The call for protests had started in early July following and inspired by the Egyptian Tamarod Movement that led to the removal of President Mohamed Morsi. Calling for a "free and democratic Bahrain", Tamarod activists, who mobilized social networking websites, said their movement was peaceful, national and non-sectarian. They called for gradual peaceful civil disobedience starting from 14 August. The movement gained the support of opposition societies and human rights activists, including those languishing in prison. The government however, repeatedly warned against the protests, promising those who participate with legal action and forceful confrontation. Rights activists and media reported that authorities had stepped up their crackdown campaigns in the weeks leading to the protests.
In late July, the king called for a parliamentary special session. The pro-government parliament submitted 22 recommendations, some of them calling for stripping those convicted of "terrorist crimes" from their nationality and banning of almost all protests in the capital, Manama. Despite outcries from the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, the king endorsed the recommendations and issued two decrees to their effect. The Prime Minister asked his ministers to carry out the recommendations immediately and issued several warnings against protests. In the following days, the government arrested three photographers, two bloggers, a lawyer and a politician, and prevented human rights activists and journalists from entering the country, deported an American teacher and reportedly encircled entire areas with barbed wire. The government denied arrests had targeted activists. A few days before 14 August, activists said they had gathered tens of thousands of signatures in support of highly anticipated protests.
The day of 14 August witnessed heavy deployment of security forces, which used tear gas and birdshot against hundreds-to-thousands of protesters who gathered in several locations throughout the country. Many shops were closed in response to Tamarod's call for a general strike. Opposition activists and media reported over 60 demonstrations throughout the country. The opposition and several citizens accused authorities of cutting Internet connections. The government blocked a website covering the protests, but activists and citizen journalists provided live coverage on social media websites, and Anonymous targeted a government website. At least twenty protesters were arrested and ten injured, two critically, activists said. The tightened security measures have succeeded in preventing large-scale protests in Manama. On 15 and 16 August, smaller protests occurred in several locations which police dispersed without injuries.
Tamarod and Al Wefaq opposition society praised the protests and said they were successful. The government of Bahrain however said protests did not affect everyday life. The United States said it supported freedom of expression and assembly, and voiced its concern at the chances of violence. Analysts were divided between those who expected protests to be huge and those that did not see them having any chance. They were also divided about the reasons behind the absence of mass protests in Manama, some blaming it on the security forces, others on protest organizers.

==Background==

Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw sustained pro-democracy protests, centered at Pearl Roundabout in the capital of Manama, as part of the wider Arab Spring. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later referred to by protesters as Bloody Thursday), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12490286 |title=Bahrain protests: Police break up Pearl Square crowd |date=17 February 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=24 May 2012[/tpl] In March, martial law was declared and Saudi troops were called in. Despite the hard crackdown and official ban, the protests continued.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14541322 |title=Bahrain profile (Timeline) |publisher=BBC News|date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2013[/tpl] According to the International Federation for Human Rights, at least 80 people were killed during the unrest.

==Calls for a rebellion==

Inspired by the Egyptian Tamarod Movement that led to the removal of President Mohamed Morsi, Bahraini opposition activists formed Bahrain Rebellion Movement on 3 July 2013 and called for mass protests starting on 14 August, the forty-second anniversary of Bahrain Independence Day under the banner Bahrain Tamarod.[tpl]cite news|title=Bahrain warns against Egypt-inspired protests|date=14 July 2013|accessdate=10 August 2013|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/14/bahrain-warns-against-egypt-inspired-protests/|agency=Agence France-Presse (AFP)|work=Fox News[/tpl] The day also marked the two-and-a-half-year anniversary of the Bahraini uprising. The movement which is also known as the August 14 Rebellion, identified itself as "a movement calling for awareness, nationalism, sovereignty, independence and legitimacy, with a message of love, loyalty and dedication to all of the Bahraini people in rebellion against the authorities."[tpl]cite web|title=Is Bahrain Next?|publisher=Al Monitor|language=English, translated by Sahar Ghoussoub from the original Arabic article in As-Safir|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2013/07/bahrain-opposition-tamarrud-protests-august-14.html|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl] One of its members said they were a youth movement, not a political party. A Reuters article described Tamarod as "a loose grouping of opposition activists who came together in early July to push for a 'free and democratic Bahrain' through mass anti-government demonstrations".
Activists mobilized social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter to campaign for the protest movement. They issued their first statement on 4 July titled "Bahrain has Risen up" and "The August 14 Rebels" describing their goals and reasons. "people of Bahrain want a nation that embraces all its citizens. We want a Bahrain to which we can all belong ... This movement is for freedom, for which Bahrainis have long yearned and made great sacrifices over many decades of struggle." The statement also accused authorities of confiscating the people's values and rights, and "restricting their movement and activities."
In an interview with France 24, Hussain Yousif, a member of the Bahrain Rebellion Movement said the movement will employ all types of peaceful civil resistance including the call for a gradual civil disobedience starting on 14 August with abstaining from shopping, commercial and government transactions such as paying electricity bills. He highlighted the royal family's almost complete monopoly on power, the political stalemate and ongoing human rights violations as main motivations. Yousif added that the main principles of the movement were peacefulness, non-exclusion and recognizing the people's right to self-determination, and called the authorities to understand their demands and refrain from using violence against protesters. "We use pure national slogans, not belonging to any specific sect or ideology," he said.[tpl]cite AV media |people=Tityanna al-Khuri and Hussain Yousif |date=9 August 2013 |title=هل ستهب عاصفة "تمرد البحرين"؟ |trans_title=Is "Bahrain Tamarod" storm coming? |medium= |language=Arabic |url=http://www.france24.com/ar/20130808-%D8%A3%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A8%D9%83%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%A3%D8%BA%D8%B3%D8%B7%D8%B3-%D9%85%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D8%B5%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86 |accessdate=10 August 2013 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format=Video |time= |publisher=France 24 |location= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= [/tpl] The Christian Science Monitor said the 14 August protests were "the latest installment of a two-year long protest movement." Protests were planned to last for three days.
Left without an epicenter after the destruction of Pearl Roundabout in 2011, Tamarod announced their plans to stage peaceful protests in nine different locations, all in the streets, with the largest expected in Manama. One of the protests was planned near the U.S. embassy, a country that protest organizers had called on to use its influence to prevent government crackdown and protect demonstrations, which they said was an "ethical responsibility" for the U.S. "We hope that you may convey our deep concern to the US State Department and the US Congress to exert a real political pressure on Bahraini regime to avoid any fatal crackdown and bloodshed," they said in an open letter.[tpl]cite news|title=Bahrain activists to test demo ban at US embassy|author=Ali Khalil|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5im2oB6uPA-15BLEggqSGD8AMhRHw?docId=CNG.04aef2c444f5d6327998e040f88576cc.281|publisher=Google|agency=AFP|date=13 August 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl]

==Events leading to the protests==

Soon after Tamarod's first statement, the Haq Movement for Liberty and Democracy announced its support for protest plans. "Let August 14 be the day of rebellion against the ruling gang in Bahrain," the movement said in a statement. The February 14 Youth Coalition also supported the protests and called for civil disobedience for 3 days. The youth group also told participants to avoid clashing with police.[tpl]cite news|title=Bahrain Opposition Calls Nationwide Rallies Against Monarchy|author=Wael Mahdi|author2=Donna Abu-Nasr|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-08-14/bahrain-opposition-kicks-off-rebellion-movement-with-protests|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=14 August 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Bahrain security forces deploy to stop planned three-day protest|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/bahrain-security-forces-deploy-to-stop-planned-three-day-protest|author=Elizabeth Dickinson|work=The National|date=15 August 2013|accessdate=15 August 2013[/tpl] Ali Salman, leader of Al Wefaq opposition society welcomed the Tamarod plans. "We support any peaceful movement, at any time and from any party. Everybody has the right to protest ... the call for protests on August 14 shows that the Bahraini people will not cease to demonstrate until they achieve their demands," he added. Al Wefaq however, stopped short of taking part in the Tamarod movement,[tpl]cite news|title=Bahrain warns protesters they will be met with force|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/13/bahrain-warns-protesters-force|work=The Guardian|date=13 August 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013|author=Ian Black[/tpl] blaming their secession on clashes between security forces and protesters.

Jailed activist Zainab al-Khawaja smuggled a letter from prison in which she called people to participate in Tamarod protests. "On 14 February 2011, the people of Bahrain took to the street to demand their rights ... and on 14 August, the day of Tamarod, the people have to go out with same strength in order to send a message to the world and the regime that they have not and will never back down," the letter read.[tpl]cite news|title=زينب الخواجة في رسالة للشعب البحريني عبر "مرآة البحرين": تمرَّدوا|language=Arabic|work=Bahrain Mirror|url=http://www.Bahrainmirror.org/news/10263.html|date=16 July 2013|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] Zainab's father, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja who is also jailed delivered a message via Mohammed al-Maskati of Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) in which he called for "a peaceful Tamarrod on August 14th ... under the banner of 'Right to Self determination'."[tpl]cite web|title=Leading human rights defender Abdulhadi AlKhawaja speaks from behind bars|url=https://www.bahrainaugust14.com/2013/08/leading-human-rights-defender-abdulhadi.html?m=1|publisher=Bahrain, August 14th 2013|date=4 August 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl] Another jailed rights activist, Nabeel Rajab also announced his support for Tamarod protests.

On 13 July, the Ministry of Interior (MoI) warned against joining the 14 August protests which it called "illegal demonstrations and activities that endanger security". The MoI said it will "deal with any attempt to disturb security and stability". In anticipation to the 14 August protests, the MoI stepped up security measures and further warned that it will take legal action toward those who participate.[tpl]cite news|title=Bahrain steps up security ahead of rebellion movement call|work=The Philippine Star|agency=Xinhua News Agency|date=14 July 2013|accessdate=10 August 2013|url=http://www.philstar.com/world/2013/07/14/968881/bahrain-steps-security-ahead-rebellion-movement-call[/tpl] The MOI has warned Bahrainis: [tpl]quote|Not to respond or react to incitement from political events and social media posts that use 'Rebellion 14 August' and encourage the overthrow of the government.

Tamarod is reported to have gained popularity among the opposition since mid-July, prompting the United States Embassy in Manama to eventually issue a warning for U.S. citizens to avoid certain areas in Bahrain on 14 August. The selected areas were mostly opposition strongholds.[tpl]cite news|title=أمريكا تحذر رعاياها من 14 أغسطس و"تمرد البحرين"|language=Arabic|work=Manama Voice|date=26 July 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013|url=http://manamavoice.com/index.php?plugin=news&act=news_read&id=14244[/tpl] For weeks, the government was reported to have intensified its house raids and arrests against over five hundred wanted activists, many of them sleeping outside their homes for months in anticipation of such raids.[tpl]cite news|title=Voices: Bahrain’s Lost Boys|author=Chloe Kems |publisher=Voice of America|date=8 August 2013|url=http://middleeastvoices.voanews.com/2013/08/voices-bahrains-lost-boys-86865/|accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]
Maryam al-Khawaja, the acting head of Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) said nightly raids were now occurring all day long and that physical, psychological and sexual torture had continued.

===Parliament emergency session===

On 28 July, the Parliament held an extraordinary session at the request of the King,[tpl]cite web|title=Little hope for Bahrain as world turns away|author=Marc Owen Jones|publisher=Yourmiddleeast.com |date=7 August 2012|accessdate=10 August 2013|url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/opinion/marc-owen-jones-little-hope-for-bahrain-as-world-turns-away_16948[/tpl] Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa in which they submitted 22 recommendations calling for tougher penalties against "terrorist crimes" including stripping those convicted with inciting or committing such acts from their nationality and freezing their bank accounts as well as a ban on protests in the capital, Manama. Other recommendations included "increasing punishment for anyone propagating false information about Bahrain in social media networks", "taking legal action against certain political associations which incite and support violent and terrorist acts" and "taking all possible measures to impose peace and security, even if it means imposing a state of national safety of emergency".
The parliament has been dominated by government supporters, especially after the opposition submitted their resignations in early 2011 in protest against government crackdown. According to RT, the Bahraini government often employs the terms "terrorists" or "thugs" to refer to protesters and has used "broad definitions of terrorism to detain scores of protesters and to convict several opposition leaders". A week earlier, the government used an explosion as a pretext to block several planned anti-government protests.[tpl]cite news|title=Bahrain parliament upholds banning protests in capital|publisher=RT|date=28 July 2013|accessdate=10 August 2013|url=http://rt.com/news/bahrain-ban-protest-capital-706/[/tpl][tpl]cite report|title=In the Name of Security: Counterterrorism Laws Worldwide since September 11|publisher=Human Rights Watch|pages=23–4|url=http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/global0612ForUpload_1.pdf|accessdate=10 August 2013|date=June 2012|isbn=1-56432-907-0[/tpl]
The session was held after weeks of escalations in clashes between protesters and security forces which had seen militant groups using bombs and police firing tear gas and birdshot, and the Minister of Justice said "terrorism" must be quelled before national reconciliation could begin.[tpl]cite news|title=Bahrain raises alarm over rising violence|author=Reem Khalifa|publisher=The Daily Star|agency=Associated Press|date=28 July 2013|accessdate=10 August 2013|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2013/Jul-28/225341-bahrain-raises-alarm-over-rising-violence.ashx[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Bahrain orders tougher penalties ahead of protests|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/28/us-bahrain-politics-idUSBRE96R08K20130728|date=28 July 2013|accessdate=10 August 2013|agency=Reuters|author=Yara Bayoumy|author2=Sami Aboudi|author3=Giles Elgood[/tpl] According to Reem Khalifa of the Associated Press, however, the session "appeared prompted by opposition calls for major protests Aug. 14." Khalil al-Marzouq of Al Wefaq said the recommendations were unconstitutional and that the session was a "popular cover the authorities in order to issue its decrees." Emile Nakhleh said the session was "a spectacle of venom, a display of vulgarity, and an unabashed nod to increased dictatorship." He added that one MP referred to the Shia, who form the majority of citizens as "dogs" and that 14 August planned protests "drove the timing of the session".[tpl]cite web|title=OP-ED: Bahrain Declares War on the Opposition|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/08/op-ed-bahrain-declares-war-on-the-opposition/|publisher=IPS News|author=Emile Nakhleh|date=1 August 2013|accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl]

Bill Law of the BBC News said the "recommendations if implemented in full would effectively return the country to a state of martial law". An unnamed western diplomat said the recommendations timing was likely due to 14 August protest plans and the increasing violence.[tpl]cite news|title=Bahrain Assembly calls for tough action as violence builds|author=Bill Law|date=31 July 2013|accessdate=10 August 2013|publisher=BBC News|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23516884[/tpl] Marc Jones said that many of the recommendations were already in place. "Thirty-one Bahrainis were stripped of their citizenship back in November 2012, and there has been a de facto ban on protests in Manama since last year," he added and listed other examples of what he called "reactionary laws" already in place.
Maryam al-Khawaja said the government was merely giving a legal cover for its practices that have been in place for years. On the other hand, Tareq Al Hassan, the Public Security Chief said the session was historical and that it did not target a specific group or sect, rather it targeted terrorists and instigators. "14 August will pass just like regular days of the year and nothing will happen," he added.[tpl]cite news|title=رئيس الأمن العام: يوم 14 اغسطس سيمر كالايام العادية كباقي السنة ولن يحدث شيئ|language=Arabic|url=http://manamavoice.com/index.php?plugin=news&act=news_read&id=14290|date=29 July 2013|accessdate=18 August 2013|work=Manama Voice[/tpl]

Human Rights Watch also criticized the recommendations, calling them "a whole new set of draconian restrictions" that would create "a new state of emergency".

===Reactions prior to protests===

Reporters Without Borders expressed its concern at what it described "a new upsurge in abusive treatment of journalists in the run-up to the major 'Tamarod' rally". The France-based NGO said authorities had arrested 2 bloggers and 3 photographers in recent days. "The authorities plan to impose a news blackout on the 14 August demonstration by jailing netizens and preventing journalists and human rights defenders from visiting Bahrain," it added. Amnesty International issued a statement calling the government of Bahrain to allow Wednesday protests and expressed its fear that the new legislation will be used as a legal cover for quashing peaceful protests. "The Bahraini authorities must not crack down on mass anti-government protests scheduled for tomorrow," it said.[tpl]cite web|title=Bahrain: End crackdown on peaceful demonstrations|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/bahrain-end-crackdown-peaceful-demonstrations-2013-08-13|publisher=Amnesty International|date=13 August 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl] The UK-based NGO also condemned the arrest of "journalists, photographers, bloggers and others active on social media networks in recent days a move to silence critics".
The Bahraini government "vehemently refutes any allegations of targeted arrests," said an Information Affairs Authority spokesperson.
Nicholas McGeehan of Human Rights Watch said the government preparations were unjustified, inappropriate and disproportionate. "Bahraini authorities have a grim recent history of using excessive and lethal force to suppress peaceful protests, followed by the persecution of protesters and even doctors who treated their wounds," he added.[tpl]cite web|title=Dispatches: Bahrain under Lockdown|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/13/dispatches-bahrain-under-lockdown|author=Nicholas McGeehan|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=13 August 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] The International Freedom of Expression Exchange described Bahrain authorities preparations as "pre-emptive crackdown on a peaceful, nationwide protest that has been weeks in the planning."[tpl]cite web|title=Peaceful protesters defy authorities' lockdown in Bahrain|author=Hiba Zayadin|url=http://www.ifex.org/bahrain/2013/08/14/tamarod_protests/|date=14 August 2013|accessdate=15 August 2013|publisher=International Freedom of Expression Exchange[/tpl] The United States embassy said it would close its doors on 14 August and told Americans to "avoid non-essential travel inside the country".

Spokesperson of Tamarod, Hussain Yousif lauded protesters response and called for further protests on Thursday and Friday,[tpl]cite news|title="تمرد البحرين": تحويل المنامة إلى هدف دائم للاحتجاجات...وشكراً للجماهير|url=http://manamavoice.com/news-news_read-14632-0.html|language=Arabic|work=Manama Voice|date=14 August 2013|accessdate=15 August 2013[/tpl] and said they planned to organize further protests in the weeks to come. "Many responded to the calls to come out and protest today ... The government has converted Bahrain into a military base trying to isolate the villages to prevent people from reaching protest sites," he added. Ali Salman of Al Wefaq praised Tamarod protests, saying they scored more success than expected by drawing media attention and maintaining peacefulness. He also expressed his relief about the small number of casualties and the lack of deaths.[tpl]cite news|title=الشيخ علي سلمان: "تمرد البحرين" نجح في الحفاظ على السلمية بصورة مذهلة|url=http://manamavoice.com/news-news_read-14636-0.html|language=Arabic|date=14 August 2013|accessdate=15 August 2013|work=Manama Voice[/tpl] Human Rights First (HRF) criticized the government of Bahrain response to protests, which they said reflected the "increasing levels of frustration felt by many in Bahrain at the lack of any real reform". "What happened today confirmed fears that the government of Bahrain is determined to crush any form of dissent," said Brian J. Dooley of HRF.
The BNA downplayed the effect of the protests, saying it was "business as usual" in the country. "Bahrainis and expatriates reported to work on Wednesday just like any other day, defying calls by radical opposition groups of road blockades and attack on properties," the state-run agency added. Critics said the protests failed as most streets were empty and protests disorganized.[tpl]sfn|Al Jazeera|2013|p=4:09[/tpl] Abdulla Al Junaid of the pro-government National Union Gathering said an opposition cleric criticized Tamarod as a "stillborn".[tpl]sfn|Al Jazeera|2013|p=19:00[/tpl] The United States expressed its concern at the possibility of violence. "We remain very concerned about continuing incidents of violence in Bahrain and, of course, the possibility for violence and would urge all parties to strongly condemn violence and contribute to fostering a climate of dialogue and reconciliation," said the spokesperson of State Department.[tpl]cite news|title=Bahrain shrugs off protest concerns|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2013/08/14/Bahrain-shrugs-off-protest-concerns/UPI-10381376485499/|date=14 August 2013|accessdate=15 August 2013|agency=United Press International[/tpl] The spokesperson added that they "supported the right of individuals to peacefully assemble and of course, the right of freedom of expression, including in Bahrain".

==Analysis==

Prior to the protests, HRF said they were "likely to be the most significant in over a year". Saeed al-Shehabi of the London-based Bahrain Freedom Movement said the Tamarod movement would "renew Bahrain's forgotten revolution".[tpl]cite news|title=دعوة ‘تمرد’ تجدد ثورة البحرين المنسية|language=Arabic|work=Al-Quds Al-Arabi|author=Saeed al-Shehabi|url=http://www.alquds.co.uk/?p=71055|date=6 August 2013|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]  Mansoor al-Jamri, editor of Al-Wasat independent newspaper expressed pessimism about the situation, saying that "it's a very volatile situation. We might be heading for a very harsh period." Marc Jones was also pessimistic. "It is unlikely that these 'Tamorrod' protests will amount to anything, especially as the Bahraini authorities have spent the past two years breaking the back of the opposition movement. In 2011, thousands were arrested, tens killed, and dozens tortured," he said.[tpl]cite web|title=Bahrain's Silent Spring: What happened to the 'Pearl revolution'?|author=Marc Owen Jones|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/14/opinion/bahrain-protests-silent-spring/index.html|date=14 August 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013|publisher=CNN[/tpl] Ashley Lindsey of Stratfor global intelligence firm said the likelihood of protests reaching Manama was low due to the experience of security forces.
Writing for RT, Afshin Rattansi speculated that if 14 August protests are met with state violence, then it could be one of the last times Bahraini activists use peaceful means to seek democratic change and that other methods could include an armed struggle in the same way the anti-apartheid movement led by Nelson Mandela deployed armed tactics after peaceful protests failed to bring about change.[tpl]cite web|title=Gunboat diplomacy: How US military support aids Bahrain’s dictatorship|url=http://rt.com/op-edge/us-military-support-bahrain-protests-490/|publisher=RT|author=Afshin Rattansi|date=14 August 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] Jean Shaoul wrote in the World Socialist Web Site that the concurrent timing of crackdown in Bahrain and Egypt was not a coincidence and that evidence showed it was coordinated by the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf.
Ken Hanly wrote that the political violence in Egypt "will no doubt overshadow whatever repressive measures are taken against protests in Bahrain".[tpl]cite web|publisher=Digital Journal|title=Op-Ed: Mass protests planned for today (Aug. 14) in Bahrain|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/356433|author=Ken Hanly|date=14 August 2013|accessdate=15 August 2013[/tpl] Ala'a Shehabi wrote in the Foreign Policy that the choice of Independence Day by Tamarod should be understood as an attempt to gain true full sovereignty as opposed to Stephen D.

Writing for the Gulf News Hasan Tariq Al Hasan argued that Tamarod protests on 14 August had failed to live up to the expectations. He said that one of the main reasons was conflicting instructions between Bahrain Rebellion Movement and February 14 Youth Coalition, which lunched its own Tamarod protest under the title "Tamarod Storm".[tpl]cite news|title=Tamarod movements without a direction|url=http://gulfnews.com/opinions/columnists/tamarod-movements-without-a-direction-1.1220761|author=Hasan Tariq Al Hasan|work=Gulf News|date=15 August 2013|accessdate=15 August 2013[/tpl] Ala'a Shehabi said the security measures had made it "physically impossible" for big numbers to gather in one place.[tpl]sfn|Al Jazeera|2013|p=16:00[/tpl] In an opinion column in Al-Wasat, Jameel al-Mahari said it was not appropriate to speak about failure or success of the protests, instead he argued that Bahrain's real success was when the unrest ended, "when everyone listens to the voice of reason, when we reach compatible solutions, when the national cohesion is restored and when people feel they are equal before law and that they all are first class citizens."[tpl]cite news|title="14 أغسطس" يمر بسلام|language=Arabic|author=Jameel al-Mahari|work=Al-Wasat|date=16 August 2013|accessdate=17 August 2013|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/3995/news/read/800698/1.html[/tpl]
