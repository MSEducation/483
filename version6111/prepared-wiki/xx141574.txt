[[List of mammals of Singapore]]

CATEGORIES: Fauna of Singapore, Lists of biota of Singapore, Lists of mammals by location, Mammals of Southeast Asia

Mammals in Singapore currently number about 50 species. Since the founding of modern Singapore in 1819, over 90 species have been recorded, including large species such as Tigers, Leopards and Asian Elephants. Most of these have since become extinct largely due to rapid urban development, with occasional large mammals such as Asian Elephants swimming across the Straits of Johor from Johor, Malaysia.
Many surviving species have critically low population numbers, the most seriously endangered being the Cream-coloured Giant Squirrel, last sighted in 1995 and now possibly extinct. The Banded Leaf Monkey is also down to around 30 individuals. However, some species may be rediscovered in more remote parts of the country, such as the Malaysian Porcupine which was found on Pulau Tekong in 2005.
The most commonly seen native mammals are the Long-tailed Macaque and the Plantain Squirrel. The largest terrestrial mammal that can still be found is the Wild Pig, which is common on the offshore islands of Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong, but also found on the mainland. The largest mammals in Singapore, however, are marine creatures such as Dugongs and Dolphins. The Colugo is also doing well, but these are rarely seen due to their elusiveness and camouflage.
