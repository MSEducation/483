Quidi Vidi Brewing Company is a microbrewery located in Quidi Vidi village, a neighbourhood of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.
Founded by David Rees and David Fong in 1996, Quidi Vidi is the third-largest brewer in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, after Labatt and Molson. Its products are available province-wide in liquor stores, corner stores and on draft, and it is the most popular microbrew in the province. It is also the largest microbrewery in Atlantic Canada.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
The names of Quidi Vidi's "Northern Lager" and "Northern Light" beers were changed in 2005 after legal action by Northern Breweries.  They were rebranded as "QV" and "QV Light". Quidi Vidi brews four other varieties: Eric's Cream Ale, 1892 Traditional Ale, QV Honey Brown Lager, and QV Honey Brown Light. A seventh variety, Iceberg, was launched in 2007/2008, and is so called because it is be brewed from glacial water from the icebergs that are commonly found off the Newfoundland coast.
Quidi Vidi brews all their beers with no adjuncts; that is, no corn or rice, only malt.
