[[C166 family]]

CATEGORIES: Digital electronics, Embedded systems, Microcontrollers

The C166 familyC166 Family http://www.infineon.com/C166 is a 16-bit microcontroller architecture from Infineon (formerly the semiconductor division of Siemens) in cooperation with STMicroelectronics. It was first released in 1993 and is a controller for measurement and control tasks. It uses the well-established RISC architecture, but features some microcontroller-specific extensions such as bit-addressable memory and an interrupt system optimized for low-latency. When this architecture was introduced the main focus was to replace 8051 controllers (from Intel).

==C167 / ST10 family==

The Siemens/Infineon C167 familyC167 familyhttp://www.infineon.com/C167 or STMicroelectronics ST10 family ST10 16-bit MCUs - STMicroelectronics is a further development of the C166 family. It has improved addressing modes and support for "atomic" instructions. Variants include, for example, Controller Area Network (CAN bus).
