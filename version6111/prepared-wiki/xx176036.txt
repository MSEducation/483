The Isuzu Journey (kana:いすゞ・ジャーニー) is a minibus produced by the Japanese manufacturer Isuzu since 1970, and in 1973 in its current somewhat larger format. The range was primarily available as city bus and tourist coach.
In Japan, Asia, Middle East, Africa and South America, its principal competitors are the Mitsubishi Fuso Rosa, Nissan Civilian, and Toyota Coaster. The Current W41 Series Journey was based on Civilian.

==History==

The first use of the "Journey" nameplate was on the 1970 "Journey S". This was an Isuzu Elf 150 truck with a 15-seater bus rear and has a KA5#B chassis code. The Elf had been available as a compact bus since 1964 but was originally still called an Elf. This was replaced in 1981 by the more space efficient and lighter Isuzu Fargo series.
In 1973 the 26-seater Journey M (on Elf 250-basis) and the longer 29-seat Journey L (Elf 350). These have diesel engines of 2.8 and 3.6 litres respectively.[tpl]cite journal | ref = JAMA23 | journal = 自動車ガイドブック Guide Book | language = Japanese | volume = 23 | year = 1976/1977 | date = 1976-10-20 | publisher = Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association | location = Japan | page = 1 | id = 0053-760023-3400 [/tpl] These engines were lateer upgraded to more powerful, cleaner units. A much larger (53 seats) rear-engined bus called Journey K appeared in 1972 and was replaced by the Isuzu Erga Mio in 1999. There was also a light duty Journey E, which is still made on Elf basis but with bodywork supplied by an outside firm.
The Journey L and M were replaced by a rebadged Nissan Civilian in 1993.
