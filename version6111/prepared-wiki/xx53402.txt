Ecteninion is a genus of meat-eating cynodont that lived during the Triassic of South America. The type species Ecteninion lunensis was named by  R.N. Martinez, C.L. May, and C.A. Forster C.A. in 1996. E. lunensis is known from a nearly complete skull of about 11Â cm in length. It was found in Carnian (Upper Triassic)-age strata of the Ischigualasto Formation in Argentina. It has been interpreted as a basal eucynodont. The holotype is in the collection of the Universidad Nacional de San Juan.
