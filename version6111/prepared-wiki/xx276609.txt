Her husband, Judah Botwin, died of a heart attack while jogging with their younger son,[tpl]cite episode|title=You Can't Miss the Bear|url=http://www.sho.com/site/weeds/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=124071|season=1|series=List of Weeds |serieslink=List of Weeds episodes#Season 1: 2005|network=Showtime|transcripturl=http://www.tvtdb.com/weeds/transcripts/1x01.php|quote=Vaneeta: Can you imagine though? Boy out, jogging with his Daddy, having a good time. Then boom, Daddy drops. That would fuck a kid up.[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl] a few weeks before the series' pilot. Nancy's children, Silas and Shane, both attend Agrestic's public school system in the early seasons of the show. During season 1, Silas was 15 years old and Shane 10.
To support her upper middle class lifestyle, Nancy begins dealing marijuana to her affluent neighbors and friends. Andy Botwin, Judah's younger brother, moves into the house after Judah's death to help Nancy out, though he also seems to be there to freeload, and often disrupts Nancy's life. Nancy's supplier is Heylia James, a major distributor in Los Angeles' West Adams district whom she met through Heylia's nephew, Conrad (who is Andy's friend).Nancy: Give me a little respect. I'm the biggest game in the private community of Agrestic. Heylia: Drugs sell themselves, biscuit, you ain't shit. ... Take that crap off my money. You not giving me a present, you're paying me for weed.[tpl]cite episode|title=You Can't Miss the Bear|url=http://www.sho.com/site/weeds/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=124071|season=1|series=List of Weeds |serieslink=List of Weeds episodes#Season 1: 2005|network=Showtime|transcripturl=http://www.tvtdb.com/weeds/transcripts/1x01.php[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl] After losing customers to a medical marijuana store, Nancy begins baking and selling pot-laced brownies. Acting on the advice of her accountant, city councilman Doug Wilson, she opens a retail bakery, stocked with Costco baked goods, as a front for her drug sales. Silas begins dating Megan, an attractive deaf girl at his school. Shane, troubled by his father's death, acts out, such as biting the foot of another child in a martial-arts tournament, earning him the nickname "Strange Botwin" from his classmates.
Nancy's chief antagonist is her neighbor, Celia Hodes, a manic, image-obsessed, and manipulative person. Celia is president of the Agrestic PTA, and does not get along with her cheating husband Dean, nor does she get along with her sexually active 15-year-old daughter, Quinn (Silas' previous girlfriend), whom she sends off to boarding school in Mexico after the pilot. Her younger daughter, 11-year-old Isabelle, is overweight and constantly the target of her mother's passive-aggressive comments, though Isabelle seems to be mature for her age, and confident. Isabelle reveals late in the season that she is a lesbian, much to her mother's chagrin. Toward the end of the season, Celia is diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. The brush with her own mortality softens her abrasive personality and leads her to treat her own daughter with more courtesy and respect - for a time. She quickly returns to form after her recovery. However, before her surgery, she meets Conrad and has sex with him. After Andy is notified to report immediately for his previously agreed-on military service (where he will be trained and then sent to Iraq) or be sentenced to a military prison, he announces that he is studying to become a rabbi because he believes it will be grounds for him to be discharged.
Drug dealing turns out to be more difficult than Nancy thought, as she discovers when she expands her customer base to Valley State College and hires Sanjay, a student at the college, to be her on-campus dealer. She is soon threatened by a rival drug dealer – Alejandro – who considers it his territory. She then has a brief sexual encounter with him. Also at Valley College, her entire stash of product is stolen by a campus security guard during a fake arrest, threatening the survival of her lifestyle and family. Unbeknownst to her, Conrad and some of his friends pay a visit to the security guard, attacking and severely beating him. The net result is that the guard politely returns the marijuana to a puzzled Nancy, apologizes profusely, and offers to assist her and her business in any way he can. Nancy and Peter Scottson (Martin Donovan), the single father of the kid bitten by Shane in a karate tournament, develop a mutual attraction, and they end up sleeping together. There is also a mutual attraction between Nancy and Conrad, much to Heylia's annoyance. The season closes with Conrad convincing Nancy to expand by becoming a grower as well as a dealer. They form a "team" that includes Doug, Dean, Sanjay and Andy. However, Nancy then encounters a shocking complication: she learns that her new boyfriend Peter is a DEA agent.
