</ref> Most of its faculties were suppressed in 1850s by the [[Franz Joseph I of Austria#Imperial absolutism, 1848–1860|Habsburg régime]] in retaliation for [[Palacký_University_of_Olomouc#Olomouc_University_in_the_year_of_revolutions|professor and student support]] for the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848 revolution]] and the [[Czech National Revival]]. The university was fully restored in 1946; it was renamed [[Palacký University of Olomouc]].
The university plays a very important role in the life of the town: With over 25,200 students (including those at Moravian College Olomouc),mvso.cz Olomouc has the highest density of university students in Central Europe. Many of the town's services are student-oriented. They close during holidays and the university exam periods. During the summer holiday, the trams run solo (apart from rush-hours), while during the university sessions, the lines are served by two coupled trams.
The university buildings comprise about a third of the town's heritage centre; notable ones include the University Art Centre and the so-called Armoury (now Central Library).
