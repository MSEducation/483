[[Order of the Eastern Star]]

CATEGORIES: Order of the Eastern Star, Organizations established in 1850, 1850 establishments in the United States, Organizations based in Washington, D.C.

The Order of the Eastern Star is a Freemasonry-related fraternal organization open to both men and women. It was established in 1850 by Boston, Massachusetts lawyer and educator Rob Morris, a former Freemason official.  The order is based on teachings from the Bible, but is open to people of all religious beliefs. It has approximately 10,000 chapters in twenty countries and approximately 500,000 members under its General Grand Chapter.
Members of the Order are aged 18 and older; men must be Master Masons and women must have specific relationships with Masons.  Originally, a woman would have to be the daughter, widow, wife, sister, or mother of a master Mason, but the Order now allows other relatives as well as allowing  Job's Daughters, Rainbow Girls, Members of the Organization of Triangle (NY only) and members of the Constellation of Junior Stars (NY only) to become members when of age.

==History==

The Order was created by Rob Morris in 1850 when, while confined by illness, he set down the principles of the order in his Rosary of the Eastern Star. By 1855, he had organized a "Supreme Constellation" in New York, which chartered chapters throughout the United States.
In 1866, Dr. Morris started working with Robert Macoy, and handed the Order over to him while Morris was traveling in the Holy Land. Macoy organized the current system of Chapters, and modified Dr. Morris' Rosary into a Ritual.
On December 1, 1874, Queen Esther Chapter No. 1 became the first Prince Hall Affiliate chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star when it was established in Washington, D.C. by Thornton Andrew Jackson.
The "General Grand Chapter" was formed in Indianapolis, Indiana on November 6, 1876. Committees formed at that time created the Ritual of the Order of the Eastern Star in more or less its current form.

==Emblem and heroines==

The emblem of the Order is a five-pointed star with the white ray of the star pointing downwards towards the manger.  In the Chapter room, the downward-pointing white ray points to the West. The character-building lessons taught in the Order are stories inspired by Biblical figures:

==Officers==

There are 18 main officers in a full chapter:
Traditionally, a woman who is elected Associate Conductress will the following year be elected to Conductress, then the next year Associate Matron, and the next year Worthy Matron.  A man elected Associate Patron will usually the next year be elected Worthy Patron.  Usually the woman who is elected to become Associate Matron will let it be known who she wishes to be her Associate Patron, so the next year they will both go to the East together as Worthy Matron and Worthy Patron. There is no male counterpart to the Conductress and Associate Conductress. Only women are allowed to be Matrons, Conductresses, and the Star Points (Adah, Ruth, etc.) and only men can be Patrons.

==Headquarters==

The General Grand Chapter headquarters, the International Temple, is located in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C., in the former Perry Belmont Mansion. The mansion was built in 1909 for the purpose of entertaining the guests of Perry Belmont.  This included Britain's Prince of Wales in 1919.  General Grand Chapter purchased the building in 1935.  The secretary of General Grand Chapter lives there while serving his or her term of office.  The mansion features works of art from around the world, most of which were given as gifts from various international Eastern Star chapters.

==Charities==

The Order has a charitable foundationhttp://www.easternstar.org/oescharities.htm and from 1986-2001 contributed $513,147 to Alzheimer's disease research, juvenile diabetes research, and juvenile asthma research. It also provides bursaries to students of theology and religious music, as well as other scholarships that differ by jurisdiction. In 2000 over $83,000 was donated.  Many jurisdictions support a Masonic and/or Eastern Star retirement center or nursing home for older members; some homes are also open to the public. The Elizabeth Bentley OES Scholarship Fund was started in 1947.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.yk.ca/advanceded/sfa/scholarships/elizabeth_bentley.html |title=Elizabeth Bentley Order Of The Eastern Star Scholarship Award |accessdate=2009-11-05 |quote= |publisher=Yukon, Canada [/tpl][tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Eastern Star has enjoyed long history |url=http://www.bclocalnews.com/lifestyles/67051602.html |quote=The Eastern Star Bursary, later named the Elizabeth Bentley OES Scholarship Fund, was started in 1947. |work=Black Press |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
