The Bernard 20 was a 1920s French single-seat monoplane fighter aircraft designed and built by the Société des Avions Bernard. Originally displayed as a mock-up at the 1928 Paris Air Show it was a low-wing monoplane based on the Bernard V2 racer. The prototype powered by a [tpl]convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Hispano-Suiza 12Jb inline piston engine first flew in July 1929 from Orly. With its racing inheritance, in 1930 the aircraft flew at a speed of 280 km/h (174 mph).  With the lack of interest by the French authorities for monoplanes the project was abandoned after 18 months of test flying.
