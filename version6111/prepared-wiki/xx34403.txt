[[Ambika (Mahabharata)]]

CATEGORIES: Characters in the Mahabharata

In the epic Mahabharata, Ambika (अम्‍बिका) is the daughter of Kashya, the King of Kashi, and wife of Vichitravirya, the king of Hastinapura.Law, B.C. (1973). Tribes in Ancient India, Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, p.105 
Along with her sisters Amba and Ambalika, she was taken by force by Bhishma from their Swayamvara. Bhishma challenged the assembled Kings and Princes and defeated them.  He presented them to Satyavati for marriage to Vichitravirya. Vichitravirya married only Ambika and Ambalika, and rejected Amba since she had already given her heart to another.
After Vichitravirya's death his mother Satyavati sent for her first born, Rishi Veda Vyasa.  According to his mother's wishes, he visited both the wives of Vichitravirya to grant them each a son under the Niyoga system.  When Vyasa visited Ambika, she saw his dreadful, forbidding appearance and burning eyes.  In her frightened state, she closed her eyes and dared not open them.  Hence her son, Dhritarashtra, the father of the Kauravas, was born blind.
After Dhritarashtra's birth, when Satyavati requested Vyasa to visit Ambika for the second time, she dared not go and sent her maid instead.  The maid also bore a son, Vidura, who was raised as a brother of Dhritarashtra and Pandu. Much later, Ambika accompanied Satyavati and Ambalika to the forest and ended her life in austerities.
