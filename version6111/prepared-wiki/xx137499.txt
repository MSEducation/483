Pier Antonio Micheli (December 11, 1679 – January 1, 1737) was a Catholic priest and noted Italian botanist,[tpl]cite book|author=Moselio Schaechter|title=Eukaryotic Microbes|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DJLIhDnqMk0C&pg=PA19|accessdate=14 August 2012|date=1 September 2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-383877-3|pages=19–[/tpl] professor of botany in Pisa, curator of the Orto Botanico di Firenze, author of Nova plantarum genera iuxta Tournefortii methodum disposita. He discovered the spores of mushrooms, was a leading authority on cryptogams, and coined several important genera of microfungi including Aspergillus and Botrytis.
Micheli was born in Florence in 1679. According to a short description from the libraries of Harvard University, he taught himself Latin and began the study of plants at a young age under Bruno Tozzi. In 1706 he was appointed botanist to Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, director of the Florence gardens, and a professor at the University of Pisa.
His Nova plantarum genera (1729) was a major step in the knowledge of fungi.[tpl]cite book|author1=Geeta Sumbali|author2=B. M.

Among these were 900 fungi and lichens, accompanied by 73 plates. He included information on "the planting, origin and growth of fungi, mucors, and allied plants", and was the first to point out that fungi have reproductive bodies or spores.[tpl]cite book|author=Marc Ratcliff|title=The Quest for the Invisible: Microscopy in the Enlightenment|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mm8yudcBZfsC&pg=PA26|accessdate=14 August 2012|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6150-4|pages=26–[/tpl] His work was meet with skepticism by other botanists of the time.[tpl]cite book|author=Frank N.

He observed that when spores were placed on slices of melon the same type of fungi were produced that the spores came from, and from this observation he noted that fungi did not arise from spontaneous generation.[tpl]cite book|author=George N.
