Erotica (from the Greek  ἔρως, eros "desire") is any artistic work that deals substantively with erotically stimulating or sexually arousing subject matter.  All forms of art may depict erotic content, including painting, sculpture, photography, drama, film, music or literature. Erotica has high-art aspirations, differentiating it from commercial pornography.[tpl]cite web|title=Pornography|url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568395/Pornography.html|work=Encarta|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbuJpkR|archivedate=October 31, 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl]  Another category is amateur pornography which includes non-commercial works.
Curiosa is erotica and pornography as discrete,  collectible items, usually in published or printed form.

==Erotica and pornography==

Distinction is often made between erotica and pornography (as well as the lesser known genre of sexual entertainment, ribaldry), although some viewers may not distinguish between them. A key distinction, some have argued, is that pornography's objective is the graphic depiction of sexually explicit scenes."Erotica Is Not Pornography". William J. Gehrke. The Tech. December 10, 1996.  Additionally, works considered degrading or exploitative tend to be classified by those who see them as such, as "porn" rather than as "erotica" and consequently, pornography is often described as exploitative or degrading."Don't confuse erotica with porn".
