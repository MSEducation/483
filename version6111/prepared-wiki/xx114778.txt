CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Cyrba is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders). 

==Description==

Cyrba spiders are small to medium size spiders that are usually brightly colored. Their cephalothorax is long and moderately high. The eyes are lateral. The abdomen is long with bright colorful patterns. Their legs are thin and slender. [tpl]cite book | last = Sebastian | first = P.

These characteristics were lost by advanced salticids. The genus are also almost wholly dependent on their vision.

Juveniles emerge in July, grow to about half the adult size by winter, and then grow to adult size in the spring of the following year.

==Silk and eggs==

The spider spins silk on which to moult. Cyrba makes an egg sac by spinning a thick silk sheet on the side of a rock, and then ovipositing the eggs in the center, covering them with another layer of silk. The egg sacs have clusters of white spots. Cyrba spiders generally stay with their eggs until they hatch. In a laboratory, they do not spin silk for moulting or resting.[tpl]cite book | last = New Zealand Journal of Zoology | title = New Zealand Journal of Zoology | year = 1900 | pages = 158â€“159 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=YYcpCso-mhUC&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=Cyrba&source=bl&ots=OsUvRVIq7e&sig=rzdHkvjwfbvXmAAAOLWa3L6rL1E&hl=en&ei=OGfsS_rdBoP_8AagmemMBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=Cyrba&f=false[/tpl]

==Diet==

Spiders in this genus feed on other spiders. They also feed on any insect that is caught in their silk. In a laboratory test to see if Cyrba spiders would attack other salticids, they did not.[tpl]cite book | last = New Zealand Journal of Zoology | title = Jackson | year = 1900 | pages = 157 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=YYcpCso-mhUC&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=Cyrba&source=bl&ots=OsUvRVIq7e&sig=rzdHkvjwfbvXmAAAOLWa3L6rL1E&hl=en&ei=OGfsS_rdBoP_8AagmemMBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=Cyrba&f=false[/tpl] The spider C. algerina is the only spider in the genus that is known to hunt at night.
