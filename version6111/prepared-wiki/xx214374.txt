==Reception==

The clip on YouTube, which is the only publicly available footage from the film, bills itself as a trailer because when it was first posted, the filmmakers intended to publicly screen the short at festivals.[tpl]YouTube|ehNFPShWTsg|"Jay and Seth vs. The Apocalypse"[/tpl] However, when the film was picked up by Mandate, the short was shelved from festival consideration. This frustrated many fans, who expected to see a feature closer to the 2007 release of the trailer online.Slashfilm: "The idea for the film began as an internet trailer..." The trailer had over 200,000 views in its first 14 months.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
