Born in Montevideo, López started playing professionally with local side Club Atlético River Plate. Two years later he signed with Racing de Santander in Spain, playing in 39 La Liga games in his debut season but receiving nine yellow cards and three red in the process; in Cantabria, he shared teams with compatriots Fernando Correa and José Zalazar.
In 1998 López moved to Italy and joined Cagliari Calcio, freshly promoted to Serie A. During his first seven seasons with the Sardinian side, with the exception of his first year – only one match – he never appeared in less than 26 league contests and spent four years (2000–04) in the second division, also being eventually awarded team captaincy.
On 14 April 2009, following a tunnel brawl with ACF Fiorentina's Felipe Melo in a 1–2 away loss, López received – as the Brazilian – a five-match ban.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1048108.html#lengthy+bans+serie+a+fighters|title=Lengthy bans for Serie A fighters|publisher=FIFA.com|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=13 November 2010[/tpl] In July, one month shy of his 35th birthday, he signed a one-year contract with Cagliari.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cagliaricalcio.net/news/notizia.asp?idNotizia=7201&type=0&id_menu=1|title=Lopez rinnova|trans_title=López renews|publisher=Cagliari Calcio|language=Italian|date=20 July 2009|accessdate=30 June 2010[/tpl] In the 2009–10 season the veteran appeared in 18 league games his team again managed to avoid relegation, after finishing in 16th position.

López and Pulga swapped roles in July 2013 after the former was admitted to the yearly UEFA Pro Licence course, thus being allowed to serve as head coach in the Italian top flight.
On Sunday 06/04/2014 owner Massimo Cellino sacked López, the 14th manager in his turbulent 8-year reign at Cagliari.

López made his debut for Uruguay on 19 October 1994, in a friendly match with Peru in the Estadio Nacional José Díaz in Lima (1–0 win).Uruguay – International Matches 1991–1995; at RSSSF
The following year he represented the nation at the Copa América, with the tournament being held on home soil and won by the hosts, who conceded just four goals in six matches. López was overlooked, however, for the squads which appeared at the 2002 and 2010 FIFA World Cups, and amassed a total of 32 caps.
