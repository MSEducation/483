[[List of rulers of China]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of Chinese monarchs, Political history of China, Chinese emperors, Chinese monarchs, China history-related lists

The list of rulers of China includes rulers of China with various titles. From the Shang dynasty to the Qin dynasty, rulers usually held the title "King" (Chinese: 王 Wáng). With the division of China into separate Warring States, this title had become so common that the unifier of China, the first Qin Emperor Qin Shi Huang created a new title for himself, that of "Emperor" (皇帝 Huángdì). This title of Emperor of China continued to be used for the remainder of China's Imperial history, right down to the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912. While many other monarchs existed in and around China throughout its history, this list covers only those with a quasi-legitimate claim to the majority of China, or those who have traditionally been named in king-lists. The following list of Chinese monarchs is in no way comprehensive.
Chinese monarchs were known by many different names, and how they should be identified is often confusing. Sometimes the same emperor is commonly known by two or three separate names, or the same name is used by emperors of different dynasties. The tables below do not necessarily include all of an emperor's names – for example, posthumous names could run to more than twenty characters and were rarely used in historical writing – but, where possible, the most commonly used name or naming convention has been indicated.
These tables may not necessarily represent the most recently updated information on Chinese monarchs; please check the page for the relevant dynasty for possible additional information.

==Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors==

Although it is ingrained in Chinese mythology that the earliest mythological rulers of China included three huáng (皇, generally translated "Sovereign" or "August one", denoting demi-god status) and five dì (帝, generally translated "Emperor", but denoting much more reverential status than the modern term "Emperor"), their identities have differed between different sources, with some individuals such as the Yellow Emperor being regarded as either Sovereign or Emperor, depending on the source. The two characters would later be taken together by Qin Shi Huang to form the new title huángdì (皇帝, Emperoror), thus claiming legendary status for himself.  These figures are all legendary, not historical.

===Shun dynasty===

The Shun dynasty was an imperial dynasty created in the brief lapse from Ming to Qing rule in China. It was a state set up by the peasants' rebellion, in which they defeated the Ming forces, but former Ming general Wu Sangui led the Qing forces into Beijing and the Qing forces defeated the rebels.

===Southern Ming dynasty===

The Southern Ming dynasty refers to the Ming loyalist regimes that existed in Southern China from 1644 to 1662.  The regime was established by the princes of the already destroyed Ming dynasty. All of these monarchs had their regimes crushed by the Qing forces very quickly. Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong) used the Ming dynasty's name and gathered forces before fleeing to Taiwan.
* The two characters are homonyms, both pronounced Lu; to distinguish them, one is usually kept as Lu and the other spelled differently. Luh is from Cambridge History of China; Lou is from A.C. Moule's Rulers of China (1957). When one irregular spelling is used, the other is kept as regular (Lu). The two systems are distinct and not used simultaneously.

==Qing dynasty==

===Taiping Rebellion===

==Yuan Shikai's Empire of China==

Yuan Shikai attempted to establish himself as emperor in 1916, but his rule is universally accepted as inauthentic. After 83 days, the reign collapsed.
