CATEGORIES: Marquessates in the Peerage of the United Kingdom

Marquess of Zetland is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 22 August 1892 for the former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lawrence Dundas, 3rd Earl of Zetland. Zetland is an archaic spelling of Shetland. The Dundas family descends from the wealthy Scottish businessman and Member of Parliament, Lawrence Dundas. In 1762 he was created a Baronet, of Kerse in the County of Linlithgow, in the Baronetage of Great Britain. The title was created with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to his brother Thomas Dundas and the heirs male of his body. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He represented Richmond and Stirling in the House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Orkney and Shetland. In 1794 he was created Baron Dundas, of Aske, North Yorkshire in the County of York, in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Dundas notably purchased the right to the earldom of Orkney and lordship of Zetland from James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton.
His son, the second Baron, was a Member of Parliament for Richmond and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Orkney and Shetland. In 1838 he was created Earl of Zetland in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He also represented Richmond and York in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire. On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the third Earl. At first a Liberal, he held minor office in the second administration of William Ewart Gladstone but later joined the Conservative Party and served from 1889 to 1892 as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The latter year he was honoured when he was made Earl of Ronaldshay, in the County of Orkney and Zetland, and Marquess of Zetland. The earldom of Ronaldshay is the courtesy title of the eldest son and heir of the Marquess. He was succeeded by his son, the second Marquess. He was also a prominent politician and served as Governor of Bengal and as Secretary of State for India.
