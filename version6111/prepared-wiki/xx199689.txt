dstore was established in January 1999 by Andrew Cooper. Cooper recognised the need for dstore to win the trust of consumers and build a relationship with them in order to win their business, using channels such as television to establish a brand presence.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bandt.com.au/news/14/0c003214.asp | title= The top 10 most influential people | accessdate = 2008-05-22[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In its early days, dstore raised around A$36 million and was backed by some of the biggest names in Australian business[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.eps.net.au/onestop/story.asp?id=155 | title=Dstore confirms first profit | accessdate = 2008-05-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080416220637/http://www.eps.net.au/onestop/story.asp?id=155  |archivedate = 2008-04-16[/tpl] including the founder of LookSmart, Evan Thornley, and Kerry Packer's ninemsn. Businessman and former NSW Premier, Nick Greiner, gave up a board seat at Coles Myer to become chairman of dstore but resigned shortly before it was sold for an undisclosed sum to the Harris Scarfe group in November 2000 for A$3 million.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;10310010 | title=HotShed eyes dstore | accessdate = 2008-05-22[/tpl]
dstore is reported to have burnt through $23 million in its first year of operating due to difficulty in luring online customers, and a failed bid to raise a further $10 million among investors in January 2000.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cio.com.au/index.php/id;1205605284 | title=Dstore Sold to Bricks-and-Mortar Chain | accessdate = 2008-05-22[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In April 2001, Harris Scarfe was placed in receivership and dstore was offered for sale by receivers and managers, Ferrier Hodgson. HotShed Retail acquired dstore on the 10th of September, 2001.
