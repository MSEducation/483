Diamond Creek railway station is located on the Hurstbridge line in Victoria, Australia. It serves the north-eastern Melbourne suburb of Diamond Creek opening on 25 June 1912.Diamond Creek Vicsig
Although the station is not normally staffed, when trains are scheduled to cross at the station in peak times  Metro Trains staff are required to operate the Staff and Ticket safeworking system used on the line. As of 2008, the points for the crossing loop and all signals are controlled electronically. Prior to 2008 the points were operated by a safeworker, and the up home signal was of the semaphore type.
Although a passing loop had been present at the station for many years (believed to have been originally used as a goods siding), the second platform was only built in the 1990s, allowing more efficient passing of trains. Before the second platform was constructed, one train had to set back after using the platform, then enter the loop to allow another train to pass.
Originally both platforms were bi-directional, however with the introduction of electronic signalling in 2008, Platform 2 can only be used by northbound trains.
