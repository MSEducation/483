Reznor's vocal lines use both minor mode and the Lydian dominant scale.

==Critical reception==

When referring to the song, Marc Hogan of Spin magazine had stated "The concept of "a copy of a copy" is somewhat quaint in a time when digital files can be copied limitlessly without any discernible drop in quality." Hogan had also described the drum machine in the song as "crisp" and the synths as "jittery", while noting the "overlapping vocals and smeared tendrils of fuzzy noise".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.spin.com/articles/nine-inch-nails-copy-of-a-stream/ | title=Hear Nine Inch Nails' Patiently Searing 'Copy of A' | publisher=Spin | date=August 12, 2013 | accessdate=August 13, 2013 | author=Hogan, Marc[/tpl] Andrew Trendell of Gigwise described the song as "an epic, sprawling and typically NIN number that features a gradual and repetitive trancey build-up with a dark intensity before an almighty rock crescendo." He also interpreted the song's lyrical theme as "a struggle for identity."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/83486/listen-nine-inch-nails-unveil-new-single-copy-of-a | title=Listen: Nine Inch Nails unveil new single 'Copy Of A' | publisher=Gigwise | date=August 12, 2013 | accessdate=August 13, 2013 | author=Trendell, Andrew[/tpl] Triple M Network inferred from the song that "Trent Reznor stays true to his roots while trying something different."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.triplem.com.au/sydney/music/news/2013/8/video-nine-inch-nails-new-single-copy-of-a-from-album-hesitation-marks/ | title=NIN's Copy Of A | publisher=Triple M Network | date=August 13, 2013 | accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl] Similarly, Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine stated that "the song is an update on an old NIN sound", while speculating on the possible muse on the postmodern condition or Fight Club on the lyrics. He also praised the musical beats by Atticus Ross and Alan Moulder and the use of Swarmatron.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/08/12/nine_inch_nails_new_single_a_copy_of_a_trent_reznor_muses_on_the_postmodern.html | title=Trent Reznor Muses on the Postmodern Condition in New Single | publisher=Slate | date=August 12, 2013 | accessdate=August 13, 2013 | author=Wickman, Forrest[/tpl] This Is Fake DIY also referred the song "as a punchy electronic piece, suitably harsh on the senses."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/news/listen-nine-inch-nails-unveils-copy-of-a-track/ | title=Listen: Nine Inch Nails Unveils ‘Copy Of A’ Track | publisher=This Is Fake DIY | date=August 12, 2013 | accessdate=August 13, 2013 | author=Milton, Jamie[/tpl] Fact magazine described the song as "an urgently paced but slow-building chiller constructed from ice-cold techno arpeggiations and droning synths",[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.factmag.com/2013/08/12/nine-inch-nails-unveil-copy-of-a-the-second-single-from-new-album-hesitation-marks/ | title=Nine Inch Nails unveil 'Copy Of A', the second single from the new album "Hesitation Marks" | publisher=Fact | date=August 12, 2013 | accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl] while Katie Hasty of Hitfix remarked the mellow vocals. She also praised the effect of looping sampler and itchy beat, contrasting it with the features of the previous single, "Came Back Haunted."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hitfix.com/immaculate-noise/nine-inch-nails-release-new-song-copy-of-a | title=Nine Inch Nails' release new song 'Copy of A' | publisher=Hitfix | date=August 12, 2013 | accessdate=August 13, 2013 | author=Hasty, Katie[/tpl] 
A parody on Trent Reznor's writing style was sung to the tune of "Copy of a." Spin referred to the parody as "reductive, unfair, and more than a little silly" but also said "the way the song deploys various Reznor moves ("random percussion," "weird guitar," "creepy piano") is priceless." http://www.spin.com/articles/nine-inch-nails-trent-reznor-parody-stream/

==Trivia==

The song was featured in the soundtrack to the video game FIFA 14.
