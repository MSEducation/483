[[Slippery eight loop]]

The slippery eight loop is an adjustable loop knot discovered by Dave Poston in 2002.

==Information==

The slippery eight loop is known to have an extraordinary ability to not slip and it is extremely secure when the legs are at less than a 90 degree angle.  The man who created this knot, Dave Poston, requests that the name of the knot include the HFP in order to honor his father who originally introduced him to knots. So the whole name of the knot would be the "HFP Slippery 8 Loop."[tpl]cite web|title=HFP Slippery 8 Loop|url=http://notableknotindex.webs.com/slippery8.html|publisher=Notable Knot Index|accessdate=11 May 2013[/tpl]
