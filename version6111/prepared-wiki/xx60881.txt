It was founded in 1989 by Jeff Yang, Amy Chu, Sandi Kim and Bill Yao to cover Asian American issues and culture, and grew out of a campus magazine Yang edited while an undergraduate at Harvard University.
The magazine operated for 12 years. On its tenth year, the magazine made a profit for the firs time. During that year it reached its circulation high of 200,000. When the economy declined in 2001, the magazine declined.
Until it ceased on February 20, 2002, it was the largest publication for English-speaking Asian Americans in the United States, with bimonthly readership exceeding 200,000 in North America.
Though well known and influential in the Asian American community, it was never profitable in its 13 year existence.
In November 1999, it obtained US $4.5 million in venture capital funding, and the company was renamed aMedia, reflecting a branching out into Web publishing. Unfortunately, this change came right as the dot-com boom was turning to bust. In early 2000, right after announcing their move to a [tpl]convert|20,000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] office in San Francisco, the stock market nosedived.  In a desperate attempt to recover, they merged with Click2Asia in November 2000. After a tough shareholder fight, the merged company was shut down in 2002.
