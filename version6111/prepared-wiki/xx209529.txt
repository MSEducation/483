The Battle of the Brothers is an American college football rivalry between the Utah Utes football team of the University of Utah and Utah State Aggies football team of Utah State University.

For much of its history, whenever the two teams played in Salt Lake City, it was held on Thanksgiving Day. However, this aspect of the rivalry ended in 1958. Since 1959, no meeting has been played on Thanksgiving Day; and more recently, the meeting has been held in September as one of the first games of the season for both teams.
In the 1970s, the University of Utah and its fans turned their sights towards Brigham Young University as their biggest rival, and the Holy War became the main rivalry in the state of Utah. But while Utah leads their series against Utah State 78–29–4,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/utah/opponents_records.php?teamid=3351|title=Utah vs Utah St.|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|accessdate=2009-08-15[/tpl] this rivalry is expected to remain a staple of each teams' annual non-conference schedule.
