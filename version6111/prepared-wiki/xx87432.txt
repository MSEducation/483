Tous ([tpl]IPA-ca|ˈtɔws|va[/tpl]) is a municipality in the Valencian Community, in the province of Valencia. The town is rather well known because, in 1982, the river Jucar broke Tous's reservoir provoking a great flood with a flood of 16,000 m3/s and more than 30 casualties. The flood was called La Pantanada.
