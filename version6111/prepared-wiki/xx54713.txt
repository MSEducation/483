The following is a list of governors or chief executives for the U.S. state of North Carolina.  See also History of North Carolina.

==Provincial Council (American Revolution)==

The 13-member Provincial Council, renamed the Council of Safety in April 1776, was essentially the executive authority during the second year of the Revolution, and was appointed by the Provincial Congress. The Presidency of the Council and the Presidency of the Congress could each be considered the highest offices in the state during this time, but the council was supreme when the congress was not in session.
