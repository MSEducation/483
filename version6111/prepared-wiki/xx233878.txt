==Family background==

Windhorst was born to a Roman Catholic couple of German and Italian extraction, Richard E. Windhorst, Sr. (1913–1985), and the former Jenny Mary Motto (1916–2001), a native of Donaldsonville, the seat of Ascension Parish near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She was the daughter of Carmello Motto and the former Angelina Latino. His brother is
Richard Windhorst, Jr., and his sister[tpl]cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.org/la/orleans/obits/1/w-16.txt|title=Jenny Mary Motto Windhorst obituary|publisher=files.usgwarchives.org|accessdate=October 16, 2009[/tpl] was Angela Windhorst Tripkovich (1938–1999) of Metairie in Jefferson Parish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=October 16, 2009[/tpl]
Windhorst graduated from the Roman Catholic Redemptorist High School in New Orleans. He is currently married to the former Barbara Turner (born c. 1941), and the two are particularly active in civic and community matters.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.nola.com/society/index.ssf/2009/08/missions_possible_on_new_orlea.html|title=Jerry McLeod, "New Orleans Party Picks"|publisher=New Orleans Times-Picayune, August 11, 2009|accessdate=October 16, 2009[/tpl]

==Conservative senator==

Senator Windhorst worked to restrict access to abortion in Louisiana. On June 27, 1990, near the end of his Senate tenure, the Louisiana State Legislature penned the strongest pro-life law in the nation, sponsored by Democratic Senator Mike Cross of Baker in East Baton Rouge Parish. Because it provided no exceptions for impregnations stemming from rape and incest, the measure was vetoed by Governor Buddy Roemer, a Democrat, who switched parties the following year. The state House overrode Roemer’s veto, but the state Senate fell three votes short of the required two-thirds majority to enact the measure over Roemer’s objection.[tpl]cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-08/news/mn-327_1_abortions-override-bill | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Abortion Bill Veto Override in Louisiana Fails | first=Garry | last=Boulard | date=July 8, 1990 | accessdate=May 3, 2010[/tpl] 
Windhorst said that the bill was an outgrowth of the failure of the United States Supreme Court to clarify regulations by the states on abortion: "We are here today because the U.S. Supreme Court did not have the courage or the resolve to be decisive."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/27/us/louisiana-lawmakers-adopt-toughest-anti-abortion-law-in-us.html | work=The New York Times | title=Louisiana Lawmakers Adopt Toughest Anti-Abortion Law in U.S | first=Roberto | last=Suro | date=June 27, 1990 | accessdate=May 3, 2010[/tpl] The Louisiana bill included an 1855 law that made abortion a felony punishable by imprisonment; the sole exception permitted was to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency.
Windhorst also voted with economic conservatives in the Senate. In a special session in 1988, he joined his colleagues in giving newly elected Governor Roemer the power to slash as much as 20 percent from department budgets, abolish or suspend certain programs, and to close institutions if necessary to keep the state financially solvent. Windhorst said that the powers transferred to Roemer were necessary: "It is either this or a much greater evil.  If we don't like what he does, we can undo it during the regular session."[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/27/us/louisiana-governor-given-broad-power-to-curb-the-budget.html | work=The New York Times | title=Louisiana Governor Given Broad Power To Curb the Budget | date=March 27, 1988 | accessdate=May 3, 2010[/tpl]

==Other political matters==

Windhorst’s later Senate tenure corresponded with the administration of Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, the second African American to head the municipal government in New Orleans. Windhorst described the Democrat Barthelemy, originally elected with considerable white support, accordingly: “Sidney doesn’t whine or complain when things go badly…He doesn’t threaten people who cross him. Just having him as mayor has sharply reduced the anti-New Orleans feelings in the legislature.”[tpl]cite web|url= http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-07112005-133748/unrestricted/Perkins_thesis.pdf|title=Thesis: L.K.

Windhorst was a delegate to the 1988 Republican National Convention which met in New Orleans to nominate the George Herbert Walker Bush and J. Danforth Quayle ticket.[tpl]cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/wilsons-winford.html|title=Political Graveyard: Fritz H. Windhorst|accessdate=October 16, 2009[/tpl]
When Windhorst retired in 1991, two-term Democratic State Representative Francis C. Heitmeier was elected to the position with 55 percent of the vote in the nonpartisan blanket primary against five opponents. The lone Republican candidate hoping to succeed Windhorst finished with fewer than 17 percent of the ballots.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms3&rqsdta=101991|title=Louisiana election returns, October 19, 1991|publisher=sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=October 16, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Because African-American influence in the Westbank increased throughout the 1990s, Heitmeier won with 58 percent of the vote in the 1995 primary and faced no opponents in 1999 and 2003. Heitmeier was term-limited in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.politicsla.com/wiki/Senate_District_7/|title=Senate District 7 (includes information on District 8)|publisher=politicsla.com|accessdate=October 16, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Windhorst is Catholic. He is also a member of the West Bank Rotary International.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rotarywestbank.org/pdf/2006/041106.pdf|title=The West Bank Rotator: Service Before Self|publisher=rotarywestbank.org|accessdate=October 16, 2009[/tpl]
