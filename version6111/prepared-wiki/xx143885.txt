Sandro Salvadore (29 November 1939 – 4 January 2007) was an Italian footballer.
Born Milan, Lombardy, Sandro Salvadore was picked up by A.C. Milan’s scouts when he was 15, and played in their junior team until he made his debut in Serie A in the 1958/59 season aged 20. While wearing AC Milan’s number 6 shirt he won 2 League titles (1958–59 and 1961–62). He left Milan after 72 league matches.
In 1962 Salvadore was purchased by Juventus and became soon a pillar of their defence. After only a few games he fully established himself as a first choice Libero, winning three more League titles (1966–67, 1971–72 and 1972–73) and one Italy’s Cup (1964–65). Salvadore was also the captain of Juventus when they finished as runners-up in the 1972–73 European Cup final and the 1973 Intercontinental Cup final.
He retired in 1974 and was replaced by Gaetano Scirea in the famous Libero role.
From 1960 to 1970 Salvadore won 36 Italy’s full caps. He was part of the team that played both the 1962 and 1966 FIFA World Cups. 
He also was part of the team that won the Third European Championship in 1968. 
Although he missed the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico because of two unfortunate own goals scored in a single match in Madrid, Spain (21 February 1970, Spain - Italy 2–2). Italian national team’s manager Ferruccio Valcareggi decided at 31, Salvadore was no longer at his best. That was the last of Salvadore's Italy caps. It could be said Ferruccio Valcareggi was proved wrong as an Italian defence minus Salvadore were beaten 4-1 in the final by Brazil 
After the retirement Salvadore spent a small period as trainer of a Juventus's youth squad, but left soon and established a small farm in Asti. His last public appearance was the 1 November 2006, invited by Juventus to the celebrations of the club’s 109th anniversary. On that occasion Salvadore received the number six shirt with his name printed.
Sandro Salvadore died of a heart attack on 4 January 2007, aged 67, in Costigliole d'Asti, in the Italian province of Asti.
