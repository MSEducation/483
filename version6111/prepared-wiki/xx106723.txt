Into the Night is a 1985 American comedy-thriller film directed by John Landis, starring Jeff Goldblum and Michelle Pfeiffer. The film is notable for a large number of cameo appearances made by various filmmakers and directors, including Landis himself. The soundtrack features the songs "Into the Night", "In the Midnight Hour" and "Lucille", performed by B.B. King.
While the picture was being filmed, Landis was still caught up in the controversy surrounding his previous release, Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), during the filming of which a helicopter accident led to the deaths of Vic Morrow and two child actors.

==Plot==

Upon discovering that his wife is having an affair, depressed insomniac Ed Okin (Jeff Goldblum) drives to the airport on Herb's suggestion (Dan Aykroyd), where he is surprised by a beautiful jewel smuggler, Diana (Michelle Pfeiffer), who lands on his car and begs him to drive her away from four Iranians who are chasing her. She persuades him to drive her to various locations, and he becomes embroiled in her predicament. After becoming increasingly exasperated with her demands, he discovers that Diana has smuggled priceless emeralds from the Shah of Iran's treasury into the country, and is being pursued by various assorted assailants, including the aforementioned agents of a criminal Iranian expatriate and a British hitman (David Bowie).
The couple's caper gets increasingly out of hand, until Diana is eventually taken hostage by the thugs at the airport; here, Ed shares his ennui with the man holding a gun to Diana's head. The man shoots himself instead. Taken to a motel room by federal agents, they are given a fortune in cash from one of Diana's wealthy friends via a federal agent. Diana showers and Ed finally sleeps. He wakes up after a full night's rest to an empty hotel room, with most of the money gone. However, when he leaves the room, Diana is waiting for him... with the money, a smile, and an offer of a ride.

==Critical reception==

Into The Night has a rating of 38% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 21 critics' reviews, indicating a generally negative critical reception.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/into_the_night |title=Into the Night (1985) at Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=rottentomatoes.com[/tpl] Vincent Canby in the New York Times wrote: "A little bit of Into The Night is funny, a lot of it is grotesque and all of it has the insidey manner of a movie made not for the rest of us but for moviemakers on the Bel Air circuit who watch each other's films in their own screening rooms." He reserved praise, however, for the performances of the two leading actors: "Mr. Goldblum does little except react to the outrages of others, which he manages with a good deal of comic poise. Miss Pfeiffer, last seen as Al Pacino's cocaine-zonked wife in Scarface, is so beautiful that one is apt not to notice that she has the potential for being a fine comedienne."[tpl]cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D04E5DC1239F931A15751C0A963948260 |title=Into the Night (1985), Review by Vincent Canby, February 22, 1985 |publisher=nytimes.com | date=February 22, 1985[/tpl] Variety held a similar view, writing that the "film itself tries sometimes too hard for laughs and at other times strains for shock," while also praising the performance of Jeff Goldblum, "nonetheless enjoyable as he constantly tries to figure out just what he's doing in all of this."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117792003.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |title=Into the Night (1985), Review |publisher=variety.com | date=January 1, 1985[/tpl]
Some critics saw the large number of cameo appearances by Landis's friends and colleagues as unnecessary and distracting. Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: "If I had been the agent for one of the stars, like Goldblum, Michelle Pfeiffer, Richard Farnsworth or Kathryn Harrold, I think I would have protested to the front office that Landis was engaging in cinematic auto-eroticism and that my clients were getting lost in the middle of the family reunion."[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19850308/REVIEWS/503080301/1023 |title=Into the Night (1985), Review by Roger Ebert, March 8, 1985 |publisher=rogerebert.suntimes.com[/tpl] Time Out wrote: "The casting of innumerable major film-makers in small roles seems an unnecessary bit of elbow-jogging, but David Bowie makes an excellent contribution as an English hit man, and the two leading players are excellent: Pfeiffer in particular takes the sort of glamorous yet preposterous part that generally defeats even the best actress and somehow contrives to make it credible every inch of the way."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/76132/into-the-night.html |title=Into The Night (1985) at Time Out Film Guide |publisher=timeout.com[/tpl]
