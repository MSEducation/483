The concept of Mary's vow of virginity had already appeared in the Protoevangelium (4:1) which asserted that Mary's mother, Anne, gave Mary as a "virgin of the Lord" in service in the Temple, and that Joseph, a widower, was to serve as her guardian (legal protections for women depended on their having a male protector: father, brother, or, failing that, a husband).Protoevangelium of James 4, 7, 8-9, 15 Early in the 7th century, in the Short Book on the Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary Isidore of Seville connected the Mariological and Christological themes by linking the virginity of Mary to the divinity of Christ in a single line of argument.The History of Theology: Middle Ages by Giulio D'Onofrio, Basil Studer 2008 ISBN 0-8146-5916-0 page 38 The Lateran Council of 649, attended by Maximus the Confessor, explicitly affirmed the teaching of Mary's virginity before, during and after birth.Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi by Karl Rahner 2004 ISBN 0-86012-006-6 pages 896-897 This was further affirmed at the sixth ecumenical council in 680.The Blackwell Companion to Catholicism'' by James Buckley, Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt, Trent Pomplun 2010 ISBN 1-4443-3732-7 page 315
Another book, "The History of Joseph the Carpenter" (7th Century), presents Jesus as speaking, at the death of Joseph, of Mary as "my mother, virgin undefiled".Saint Joseph: His Life and His Role in the Church Today by Louise Bourassa Perrotta 2000 ISBN 0-87973-573-2 page 86
Over the centuries the interpretation of Mary as an ever virgin bride of the Lord who had taken a vow of perpetual chastity spread and was in full vogue by the time of Rupert of Deutz in the 12th century. By the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas had fashioned long and detailed theological arguments in defense of the doctrine and stated that a denial of the perpetual virginity of Mary would be derogatory to the perfection of Christ, an insult to the Holy Spirit, and an affront to the dignity of the Mother of God.Aquinas on doctrine: a critical introduction by Thomas Gerard Weinandy, John Yocum 2004 ISBN 0-567-08411-6 page 95The Westminster handbook to Thomas Aquinas by Joseph Peter Wawrykow 2005 ISBN 0-664-22469-5 page 91

===Mary, the Second Eve===

As of the fourth century, in discussing God's plan of salvation, a parallel theme began to appear in which Mary's obedience (be it unto me according to thy word in Luke 1:38) and the doctrine of perpetual virginity were counter-positioned against Adam and Eve, just as Jesus' obedience was counter positioned against that of Adam in Romans 5:12-21.
The concept of Mary as the Second Eve was first introduced by Justin Martyr around 155 AD.What Every Catholic Should Know about Mary by Terrence J. McNally 2009 ISBN 1-4415-1051-6 page 185 In this perspective, which was discussed in detail by Irenaeus, supported by Jerome, and then grew further, the vow of obedience and virginity of  Mary positioned her as the  "Second Eve" as part of the plan of salvation, just as Jesus was positioned as the Second Adam.
The theme developed by the Church Fathers ran parallel to the theme developed by Apostle Paul in Romans 5:18-21 when he compared Adam's sin with the obedience of Jesus to the will of the Father, all the way to Calvary: "For just as by the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous."An exposition of the epistle of Saint Paul to the Philippians by Jean Daille 1995 ISBN 0-8028-2511-7 pages 194-195 In the same manner, Mary's obedience to the statements of the angel, and her adherence to her vow of perpetual virginity was seen as a remedy for the damage caused by Eve.''Blessed one: Protestant perspectives on Mary Beverly Roberts Gaventa, Cynthia L. Rigby 2002 ISBN 0-664-22438-5 page 64
The Second Eve teaching continued to grew among Catholics, and in discussing perpetual virginity, the 1566 Catechism of the Council of Trent explicitly taught that while Eve by believing the serpent brought malediction on the human race, Mary by believing the angel brought benediction to mankind.This Is the Faith by Francis J. Ripley 1973 ISBN 0-85244-678-0 page 264The Catechism of the Council of Trent Translated Into English by Theodore Alois Buckley, ISBN 1-112-53771-6 pages 45-46 (Article III, Chapter VI, Question IX) http://books.google.com/books?id=940_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA45&dq=perpetual+virginity+trent+malediction&hl=en&ei=PpFgTov9MdT54QSAlOFl&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false
The concept of the Second Eve has continued to remain part of Catholic teachings, e.g. Pope Pius XII referred to it in the encyclical Mystici Corporis Christi and Pope John Paul II referred to it in a General Audience at the Vatican in 1980.Varican website: Mystici Corporis ChristiVatican website: ''Pope John Paul II General Audience March 12, 1980

==Protestant Reformation==

The start of the Protestant Reformation at the beginning of the 16th century did not immediately bring about a rejection of the doctrine of perpetual virginity and several leaders of the Reformation provided varying degrees of support for it, at times without directly endorsing it.
The early Protestant reformers felt that Scripture required the acceptance of the virgin birth of Jesus, but only permitted the acceptance of perpetual virginity.Reformation of church and dogma (1300-1700) by Jaroslav Jan Pelikan, 1985, ISBN 0-226-65377-3, p339 Over time, many Protestant churches stopped teaching the doctrine and other Protestant churches denied it.What Every Catholic Should Know about Mary by Terrence J. McNally 2009 ISBN 1-4415-1051-6 page 170Christian confessions: a historical introduction by Ted Campbell, 1996 ISBN 0-664-25650-3 page 47

===Early reformers===

Martin Luther believed that Mary did not have other children and did not have any marital relations with Joseph. The Latin text of the 1537 Smalcald Articles, written by Martin Luther, used the term "Ever Virgin" to refer to Mary.Christian confessions: a historical introduction by Ted Campbell 1996 ISBN 0-664-25650-3 page 150 The perpetual virginity of Mary was Luther's lifelong belief, even after he rejected other Marian doctrines.Luther's Works, 22:214-215"Sermon on the Presentation of Christ in the Temple", Luthers Werke 52:688- 99,quoted in Jaroslav Pelikan, Mary through the Ages, 158, and Martin Luther's Theology of Mary
Huldrych Zwingli directly supported perpetual virginity and wrote: "I firmly believe that  Mary, ... forever remained a pure, intact Virgin."[tpl]cite book|last=Zwingli|first=Ulrich|coauthors=Egli, Emil; Finsler, Georg; Zwingli-Verein, Georg; Zürich|title=Huldreich Zwinglis sämtliche Werke|publisher=C. A.

Luther and Zwingli's support of perpetual virginity was endorsed by Heinrich Bullinger and was included in the 1566 Second Helvetic Confession.Blessed one: Protestant perspectives on Mary by Beverly Roberts Gaventa, Cynthia L. Rigby 2002 ISBN 0-664-22438-5 page 119
John Calvin "was less clear-cut than Luther on Mary's perpetual virginity but undoubtedly favored it".Encyclopedia of the Reformed faith by Donald K. McKim, David F. Wright 1992 ISBN 0-664-21882-2 page 237 He cautioned against "impious speculation" on the topic. In his commentary of Luke 1:34, he rejected as "unfounded and altogether absurd" the idea that Mary had made a vow of perpetual virginity, saying that "She would, in that case, have committed treachery by allowing herself to be united to a husband, and would have poured contempt on the holy covenant of marriage; which could not have been done without mockery of God" and adding that there is no evidence of the existence of such vows at the time.Calvin. "Commentary on Luke 1:34". Harmony of Matthew, Mark, and Luke vol. 1. Full statement: "The conjecture which some have drawn from these words shall this be, since I know not a man?', that she had formed a vow of perpetual virginity, is unfounded and altogether absurd. She would, in that case, have committed treachery by allowing herself to be united to a husband, and would have poured contempt on the holy covenant of marriage; which could not have been done without mockery of God. Although the Papists have exercised barbarous tyranny on this subject, yet they have never proceeded so far as to allow the wife to form a vow of continence at her own pleasure. Besides, it is an idle and unfounded supposition that a monastic life existed among the Jews." He rejected the argument based on the mention in Scripture of brothers of Jesus that Mary had other children.Harmony of Matthew, Mark & Luke, sec. 39 (Geneva, 1562), / From Calvin's Commentaries, tr. William Pringle, Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1949: “Helvidius displayed excessive ignorance in concluding that Mary must have had many sons, because Christ's 'brothers' are sometimes mentioned” (vol. 2, p. 215); “Matt 1:25: The inference he Helvidius drew from it was, that Mary remained a virgin no longer than till her first birth, and that afterwards she had other children by her husband . . . No just and well-grounded inference can be drawn from these words . . . as to what took place after the birth of Christ. He is called 'first-born'; but it is for the sole purpose of informing us that he was born of a virgin . . . What took place afterwards the historian does not inform us . . . No man will obstinately keep up the argument, except from an extreme fondness for disputation.“ (vol. I, p. 107)
The Anglican reformers of the 16th and 17th century supported perpetual virginity "on the basis of ancient Christian authority". In the 18th century, John Wesley, one of the founders of Methodism, also supported the doctrine and wrote that: "... born of the blessed Virgin Mary, who, as well after as before she brought Him forth, continued a pure and unspotted virgin."The works of the Rev. John Wesley, Volume 15 by John Wesley, Joseph Benson, Published by Thomas Cordeux, London, 1812, "A Letter to a Roman Catholic" page 110 http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC09022224&id=CZEPAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA110Letter to a Roman Catholic, July 18, 1749

===Later Protestant teachings===

Many current Protestant churches teach the virgin birth of Jesus, without teaching that Mary remained a virgin for the rest of her life.
Diarmaid MacCulloch, a historian of the Reformation, wrote that the reason why the early reformers upheld Mary’s perpetual virginity was that she was "the guarantee of the Incarnation of Christ", a teaching that was being denied by the same radicals that were denying Mary’s perpetual virginity.D. MacCulloch, The Reformation: a History (Penguin Books, 2003) pp. 613-614; cf. Robert Schihl, The Perpetual Virginity of Mary for an extended list and quotations. However, the absence of clear Biblical statements expressing the doctrine, in combination with the principle of sola scriptura, kept references to the doctrine out of the Reformation creeds and, together with the tendency to associate veneration of Mary with idolatryD. MacCulloch, The Reformation: a History (Penguin Books, 2003) pp. 558-63 and the rejection of clerical celibacy,see John Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion IV,12,27-28 led to the eventual denial of this doctrine among Protestants, who took the "brothers" (ἀδελφοί) οf Jesus mentioned in the New Testament to be most naturally (but not certainly) children of Mary and thus Jesus' half brothers or left the question open.See, e.g., [tpl]cite book |author=David Brown |title=Commentary, Critical and Explanatory, on the Whole Bible |chapter=Commentary on Matthew 13:56 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/jamieson/jfb.xi.i.xv.html#xi.i.xv-p102.3 |accessdate=2009-01-07 |quote=An exceedingly difficult question here arises—What were these 'brethren' and 'sisters' to Jesus? Were they, First, His full brothers and sisters? or, Secondly, Were they His step-brothers and step-sisters, children of Joseph by a former marriage? or, Thirdly, Were they cousins, according to a common way of speaking among the Jews respecting persons of collateral descent? On this subject an immense deal has been written, nor are opinions yet by any means agreed. For the second opinion there is no ground but a vague tradition, arising probably from the wish for some such explanation. The first opinion undoubtedly suits the text best in all the places where the parties are certainly referred to (Mt 12:46; and its parallels, Mr 3:31; Lu 8:19; our present passage, and its parallels, Mr 6:3; Joh 2:12; 7:3, 5, 10; Ac 1:14). But, in addition to other objections, many of the best interpreters, thinking it in the last degree improbable that our Lord, when hanging on the cross, would have committed His mother to John if He had had full brothers of His own then alive, prefer the third opinion; although, on the other hand, it is not to be doubted that our Lord might have good reasons for entrusting the guardianship of His doubly widowed mother to the beloved disciple in preference even to full brothers of His own. Thus dubiously we prefer to leave this vexed question, encompassed as it is with difficulties.[/tpl]
However, some conservative Lutheran scholars such as Franz Pieper (1852–1931) refused to follow the tendency among Protestants to insist that Mary and Joseph had marital relations and children after the birth of Jesus. It is implicit in his Christian Dogmatics that belief in Mary's perpetual virginity is the older and traditional view among Lutherans.Francis Pieper, Christian Dogmatics, 4 vols., (St. Louis: CPH, 1950-53), 2:308-09. He stated, that  "we should simply hold that (Mary) remained a virgin after the birth of Christ because Scripture does not state or indicate that she later lost her virginity"."Scripture does not quibble or speak about the virginity of Mary after the birth of Christ, a matter about which the hypocrites are greatly concerned, as if it were something of the utmost importance on which our whole salvation depended.  Actually, we should be satisfied simply to hold that she remained a virgin after the birth of Christ because Scripture does not state or indicate that she later lost her virginity... But the Scripture stops with this, that she was a virgin before and at the birth of Christ; for up to this point God had need of her virginity in order to give us the promised blessed seed without sin" (That Jesus Christ Was Born a Jew (1523), in Luther’s Works, American Edition, Walther I. Brandt, ed., Philadelphia, Augsburg Fortress; St. Louis, Concordia Publishing House, 1962, ISBN 0-8006-0345-1 pp. 205-206; cf. James Swam (Martin Luther's Theology of Mary). He taught that "Christ, our Saviour, was the real and natural fruit of Mary's virginal womb . . . This was without the cooperation of a man, and she remained a virgin after that"; and that " Christ . . . was the only Son of Mary, and the Virgin Mary bore no children besides Him . . . I am inclined to agree with those who declare that 'brothers' really mean 'cousins' here, for Holy Writ and the Jews always call cousins brothers".Luther's Works, eds. Jaroslav Pelikan (vols. 1-30) & Helmut T. Lehmann (vols. 31-55), St. Louis: Concordia Pub. House (vols. 1-30); Philadelphia: Fortress Press (vols. 31-55), 1955, v.22:23 / Sermons on John, chaps. 1-4 (1539), quoted in Martin Luther on Mary's Perpetual Virginity  Against this view Taylor points out that if they were actually cousins the word 'adelphoi' (brothers), was unnecessary linguistically, because the word 'anepsios' (cousin, as in e.g. Col 4:10) lay "lay ready to hand", and inappropriate metaphorically, because they were opposed to Jesus' ministry.Taylor, The Gospel According to St Mark, 1952, MacMillan, London. p248

==Scripture==

The New Testament refers to Jesus' brothers and sisters; they are mentioned in such verses as [tpl]bibleverse||Mark|6:3|[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Matthew|13:55|[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||John|7:3|[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Acts|1:14|[/tpl] and [tpl]bibleverse|1|Corinthians|9:5|[/tpl] and include James, Joses (the form in [tpl]bibleverse||Mark|6:3[/tpl], but "Joseph" in [tpl]bibleverse||Matthew|13:55[/tpl]), Simon, and Jude. Prima facie these verses argue against Mary's perpetual virginity, but there are possible explanations which lead to the conclusion that "it cannot be said that the NT identifies brothers and sisters without doubt as blood brothers and sisters and hence as children of Mary"Raymond E. Brown, Karl P. Donfried, Joseph Fitzmyer and John Reumann ed., Mary in the New Testament (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, and Mahwah, NJ: Paulist Press, 1978 ISBN 978-0-80912168-7), p. 72François Rossier: The "Brothers and Sisters" of Jesus: Anything New?
In relation to Mark 6:3 Jerome, "apparently voicing the general opinion of the Church" about the perpetual virginity of Mary in opposition to the view put forward in about 382 by Helvidius that they were children of Joseph and Mary, proposed that they were cousins of Jesus, the sons of Mary the wife of Clopas and sister of the Virgin.  This new view, "strongly coloured by Jerome's belief in the perpetual virginity, is almost universally rejected except by Roman Catholic scholars". The view with most support in the Fathers, and with some support in modern writers such as Lightfoot, is that of Epiphanius: they were children of Joseph by an earlier marriage, the view generally accepted among Eastern Christians.Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-280290-3), article "Brethren of the Lord" A more recent hypothesis is that they were children of Cleopas, a brother of Joseph according to Hegesippus, and of "Mary, the mother of James and Joses" seen as sister-in-law, not blood sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Helvidius' view, that they were the children of Joseph and Mary, is supported, according to Taylor, by at least some of the Fathers, albeit to a lesser degree than that of Epiphanius, and by "many moderns scholars": this view is also "the simplest and most natural" one according to Taylor.Vincent Taylor, The Gospel According to St Mark, 1952, MacMillan, London. p248 
In relation to 1 Cor 9:5, the "most natural interpretation is that un-named "brothers of the Lord" were the children of Joseph and Mary" says Leon Morris.Leon Morris, 1 Corinthinas, an Introduction and Commentary, 1958, IVP, Leicester, p 133. C K Barrett agrees, arguing that this passage is "most naturally taken to refer to sons of Mary and Joseph", however he allows that they are "conceivably ... sons of Joseph by a former wife".C K Barrett, A Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians, 2nd Edition (1971), A&C Black, London, p 203.
[tpl]bibleverse||Matthew|1:25[/tpl] states that Joseph had no marital relations with Mary "until" (ἕως οὗ ) she had borne Jesus. Writers such as R.V. TaskerTasker, R.V., The Gospel according to Saint Matthew (InterVarsity Press 1961), p. 36 and D. HillHill D., The Gospel of Matthew, p80 (1972) Marshall, Morgan and Scott:London argue that this implies that Mary and Joseph had customary marital relations after the birth of Jesus. Others, such as K. Beyer, point out that Greek ἕως οὗ after a negative "often has no implication at all about what happened after the limit of the 'until' was reached",Raymond E. Brown, The Birth of the Messiah (Doubleday 1999 ISBN 978-0-385-49447-2), p. 132 and Raymond E. Brown observes that "the immediate context favors a lack of future implication here, for Matthew is concerned only with stressing Mary's virginity before the child's birth".  Gregory of Nyssa interpreted Mary's response to the angel, when told that she will conceive ("How will this be, since I am a virgin?) as indicating that Mary had taken a lifelong vow of virginity, even in marriage: "For if Joseph had taken her to be his wife, for the purpose of having children, why would she have wondered at the announcement of maternity, since she herself would have accepted becoming a mother according to the law of nature?",Gregory of Nyssa, On the Holy Generation of Christ, 5. however writers such as Howard Marshall reject it outright: "It is impossible to see how the text can yield this meaning",(Howard Marshall, I.,  The Gospel of Luke (Paternoster Press 1978), p. 68); and is considered implausible by Raymond E. Brown.Brown, The Birth of the Messiah, p. 304  Taylor shares Howard Marshall's view and points to Lightfoot's acknowledgement that the expressions used here and in Luke 2:7 "would have been avoided by writers who believed in the perpetual virginity of Mary".Taylor, The Gospel According to St Mark, 1952, MacMillan, London, p249
A passage used to support the doctrine of perpetual virginity is of the sayings of Jesus on the cross, i.e. the pair of commands first to his mother "Woman, behold your son!" and then to his disciple "Behold, thy mother!" in John 19:26-27.Fundamentals of Catholicism by Kenneth Baker 1983 ISBN 0-89870-019-1 pages 334-335 The Gospel of John then states that "from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home". Since the time of the Church Fathers this statement has been used to reason that after the death of Jesus there was no one else in the immediate family to look after Mary, and she had to be entrusted to the disciple given that she had no other children. This passage was one of the arguments Pope John Paul II presented in support of perpetual virginity.Pope John Paul II's General Audience of 28 August 1996, printed in L'Osservatore Romano, Weekly Edition in English, 4 September 1996 The article at EWTNVatican website: Pope John Paul II's General Audience of 28 August 1996 (in Italian) John Paul II also reasoned that the command "Behold your son!" was not simply the entrustment of Mary to the disciple, but also the entrustment of the disciple to Mary in order to fill the maternal gap left by the death of her only son on the cross.L'Osservatore Romano, Weekly Edition in English, 30 April 1997, page 11 Article at EWTNVatican website: Pope John Paul II's General Audience of 28 April 1997 reprinted in L'Osservatore Romano, Weekly Edition in English, 30 April 1997, page 11  Taylor points out difficulties in this interpretation of the text: it ignores both the fact that Jesus 'brothers' opposed his claims, and the position of honour of John, the 'beloved disciple'.

==Islamic perspective==

In Sura 19,The Holy Qur'an: Maryam (Mary), Sura 19 (Translation by A. Yusuf Ali) the Qur'an declares that Jesus was the result of a virgin conception (verses 20-22).  There is no clear doctrinal belief one way or another, but some extend this to mean the perpetual virginity of Mary.The Truth about Islam & Jesus by John Ankerberg, Emir Caner 2009 ISBN 0-7369-2502-3 page 65 http://books.google.com/books?id=-XgH1R2AhbgC&pg=PA65&dq=%22Perpetual+virginity%22+of+Mary+islam&hl=en&ei=0oVcTonHAs7DtAaN56G6Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22Perpetual%20virginity%22%20of%20Mary%20islam&f=falseWhat Every Catholic Should Know about Mary by Terrence J.
