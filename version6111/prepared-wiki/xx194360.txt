Get Well Soon is a music and band project of the German singer, songwriter and instrumentalist Konstantin Gropper (born September 28, 1982 in Biberach an der Riß, Upper Swabia, Baden-Württemberg).
Gropper worked 3 years on his debut album Rest Now, Weary Head! You Will Get Well Soon which was released in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Benelux, Spain, Italy by the Label City Slang and by Nude Records in the UK and Ireland in January 2008 following lots of positive reviews in the biggest German, French and UK music magazines. The lyrics are known to be slightly philosophical and cynical (e.g. Witches! Witches! Rest Now In The Fire and We Are Safe Inside While They Burn Down Our House). The album entered the German Album Charts on no. 28. It also entered the Austrian and Swiss charts and was successful in Benelux as well. The release tour with 19 most sold out shows was the most successful newcomer tour in Germany in 2008. The Album release was followed by great press reviews (NME, Word Magazine, Uncut, Artrocker, Guardian). The album was released in France in September 2008 and entered the official French album charts on no. 91.
In 2008 Konstantin Gropper also wrote exclusive tracks for the latest Wim Wenders movie Palermo Shooting, alongside other artists like Portishead and Nick Cave.
The second album Vexations was released in Europe in January 2010. Unlike the debut, it was preproduced by Konstantin Gropper and then was recorded with a full band in a studio. It entered the German album charts at number 11 (charts entries in most European countries) and the European charts on 52. It was followed by great press reviews (NME, Word Magazin, Mojo, Musikexpress, Visions, Spex, Uncle Sallys, FAZ, SZ, Le Monde, Liberation etc..). The release was followed by a soldout 36 shows tour throughout Europe.
In 2011 Konstantin Gropper wrote the scoremusic to the first season of the French series Xanadu, which was broadcast in France and Germany by ARTE TV.
