The 1960 U.S. Open was the 60th U.S. Open, held June 16–18 at Cherry Hills Country Club in Englewood, Colorado, a suburb south of Denver. Arnold Palmer staged the greatest comeback in U.S. Open history, erasing a seven-stroke deficit during the final round to win his only U.S. Open title.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.golf.com/tour-and-news/fortunate-eyewitnesses-1960-us-open-cherry-hills-recall-best-damn-open-ever |publisher=GOLF.com |title=The fortunate eyewitnesses to the 1960 U.S. Open... |last=Garrity |first=John |date=May 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 17, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite magazine |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1071443/index.htm |magazine=Sports Illustrated |title=Destiny's new favorite |last=Wind |first=Herbert Warren |authorlink=Herbert Warren Wind |date=June 27, 1960 |page=24 |accessdate=June 19, 2012[/tpl] It is remembered as a crossroads for the three primary contenders in the final round: Palmer, Ben Hogan, and Jack Nicklaus; three of the greatest players in the history of golf.[tpl]cite magazine |url=http://golfweek.com/news/2010/jun/14/three-eras-intersected-wildest-open-ever/ |magazine=Golfweek |title=Three eras intersected at 'wildest Open ever' |last=McCabe |first=Jim |date=June 14, 2010 |accessdate=June 17, 2012[/tpl]
Having already won the Masters, Palmer was half-way to the single-season Grand Slam with his win at Cherry Hills. His quest ended three weeks later at the British Open, when he lost to Kel Nagle by one stroke at St Andrews. Two weeks later, he finished five strokes back in a tie for seventh at the PGA Championship, the only major which eluded him for his career. This was Palmer's only victory at the U.S. Open; he finished second four times, including three losses in playoffs in 1962, 1963, and 1966.
This was the third major championship at Cherry Hills, which previously hosted the U.S. Open in 1938 and the PGA Championship in 1941. The U.S. Open returned in 1978 and the PGA Championship in 1985. The average elevation of the course exceeds [tpl]convert|5300|ft|m|-1[/tpl] above sea level.

Palmer trailed leader Mike Souchak by eight strokes after 36 holes, and by seven shots after 54 holes. Almost everyone believed he was out of contention beginning the final round, tied for fifteenth place. Palmer drove the green on the par-4 1st to set up a two-putt birdie,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.usgamuseum.com/about_museum/news_events/news_article.aspx?newsid=124 |publisher=USGA Museum |title=A long look back at the 1960 Open |last=Palmer |first=Arnold |date= June 11, 2010 |accessdate=June 17, 2012[/tpl] then chipped in from [tpl]convert|90|ft|0[/tpl] for birdie at the second. After nearly making an eagle at 3 and tapping in for another birdie, he holed an 18-footer for birdie at 4 then made two more birdies at 6 and 7. He cooled off the rest of his round, finally carding a 65 (−6) for a 280 (−4) total. It was the lowest final round in U.S. Open history. Twenty-year-old Jack Nicklaus, the two-time U.S. Amateur champion playing in his fourth Open, was also in contention during the final round, briefly holding the lead after making eagle at 5 and birdie at 9. Two three-putts on the back-nine, however, dropped him to a 282 (−2) total, two strokes behind Palmer. His second place finish was the best showing by an amateur at the U.S. Open since Johnny Goodman won in 1933. Aiming for a record fifth U.S. Open title at age 47, Ben Hogan was tied for the lead on the 71st tee, a par 5. He hit his third shot in the water and made bogey. Needing birdie to tie on 18, he again found water, triple-bogeyed, and finished in a tie for ninth place. Souchak shot a final round 75 on his way to a tie for third.
