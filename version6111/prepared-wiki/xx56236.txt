Dr. Martens is a British  footwear and clothing brand, which also makes a range of accessories – shoe care products, clothing, luggage, etc. In addition to Dr. Martens, they are also commonly known as Doctor Martens, Doc Martens, Docs or DMs. The footwear is distinguished by its air-cushioned sole (dubbed Bouncing Soles), upper shape, welted construction and yellow stitching.

==History==

Klaus Märtens was a doctor in the German army during World War II. While on leave in 1945, he injured his ankle while skiing in the Bavarian Alps. He found that his standard-issue army boots were too uncomfortable on his injured foot. While recuperating, he designed improvements to the boots, with soft leather and air-padded soles made of tyres.Martin Roach: Dr. Martens The Story of an icon, 2003 When the war ended and some Germans looted valuables from their own cities, Märtens took leather from a cobbler's shop. With that leather he made himself a pair of boots with air-cushioned soles.[tpl]cite web|title=About Dr, Martens|url=http://www.dmusastore.com/t-about-dr-martens.aspx|work=dmusastore.com|accessdate=8 October 2010[/tpl]
Märtens did not have much success selling his shoes until he met up with an old university friend, Dr. Herbert Funck, a Luxembourger, in Munich in 1947. Funck was intrigued by the new shoe design, and the two went into business that year in Seeshaupt, Germany, using discarded rubber from Luftwaffe airfields.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] The comfortable soles were a big hit with housewives, with 80% of sales in the first decade going to women over the age of 40.[tpl]cite news|last=Mazein|first=Elodie|title=Dr Martens 50 years old and still an icon to boot|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/executive-style/style/dr-martens-50-years-old-and-still-an-icon-to-boot-20100401-ri3n.html#ixzz24MBxAyvs|accessdate=23 August 2012|date=2 April 2010[/tpl]
Sales had grown so much by 1952 that they opened a factory in Munich. In 1959, the company had grown large enough that Märtens and Funck looked at marketing the footwear internationally. Almost immediately, British shoe manufacturer R. Griggs Group Ltd. bought patent rights to manufacture the shoes in the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web|title=R. Griggs Group Ltd.|url=http://www.hoovers.com/company/R_Griggs_Group_Ltd/cyfhti-1.html|work=hoovers.com|accessdate=8 October 2010[/tpl] Griggs anglicised the name, slightly re-shaped the heel to make them fit better, added the trademark yellow stitching, and trademarked the soles as AirWair.
The first Dr. Martens boots in the United Kingdom came out on 1 April 1960 (known as style 1460 and still in production today), with an eight-eyelet oxblood coloured smooth leather design.  Dr. Martens boots were made in their Cobbs Lane factory (which is still operating today). In addition, a number of shoe manufacturers in the Northamptonshire area produced DM's under license, as long as they passed quality standards. The boots were popular among workers such as postmen, police officers and factory workers. By the early 1970s, skinheads started wearing them, and by the late 1980s, they were popular among scooter riders, punks, some New Wave musicians, and members of other youth subcultures.[tpl]cite news|last=Manzoor|first=Sarfraz|title=Dr Martens at 50: these boots were made for… everyone|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/31/dr-martens-at-50?intcmp=239|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=The Observer|date=31 October 2010[/tpl] The shoes' popularity among skinheads led to the brand gaining an association with violence. Alexei Sayle sang the song "Dr. Martens' Boots" in a 1982 episode 
of the British TV comedy The Young Ones.
The boots and shoes became popular in the 1990s as grunge fashion arose. In late November 1994, a six-storey Dr. Martens  department store was opened in Covent Garden in London which sold food, belts, and watches, as well as shoes. At this time the R. Griggs company employed 2,700 people, expected to earn annual revenue of £170 million, and could produce up to 10 million pairs of shoes per year.[tpl]cite news|last=Ipsen|first=Erik|title=Doc Martens to Stomp Into London|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/17/business/worldbusiness/17iht-doc.html|accessdate=22 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 November 1994[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Menkes|first=Suzy|title=London Launch For Hip Shoes: Flagship For Doc Martens|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/29/style/29iht-fdoc.html|accessdate=22 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 November 1994[/tpl] Dr. Martens sponsored Rushden & Diamonds F.C. from 1998 to 2003, and when a new main stand was built at Nene Park in 2001, it was named the Airwair Stand. 
In the 2000s, Dr. Martens were sold exclusively under the AirWair name, and came in dozens of different styles, including conventional black shoes, sandals and steel-toed boots. AirWair International's revenue fell from US $412 million in 1999 to $127 million in 2006.[tpl]cite news|last=Newman|first=Andrew Adam|title=An Antifashion Classic Returns|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/business/media/03adcol.html|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 December 2007[/tpl] In 2003, the Dr. Martens company came close to bankruptcy.[tpl]cite news|last=Muston|first=Samuel|title=The Timeline: 50 Years of Dr Martens|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/the-timeline-50-years-of-dr-martens-2123443.html?origin=internalSearch|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=3 November 2010[/tpl] On 1 April that year, under pressure from declining sales, the company ceased making shoes in the United Kingdom,[tpl]cite news|title=Dr Martens factories close|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2896307.stm|accessdate=8 October 2010|newspaper=BBC News|date=23 March 2003[/tpl] and moved all production to China and Thailand. Five factories and two shops were closed in the UK as a result of this decision, and more than 1000 of the firm's employees lost their jobs.[tpl]cite news|last=Pyke|first=Nicholas|title=Dr Martens is on its uppers|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2002/oct/26/manufacturing?INTCMP=SRCH|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 October 2002[/tpl] Following the closures, the R.

In 2004, Dr. Martens began producing footwear again at the Cobbs Lane Factory in Wollaston, England. These products are part of the "Vintage" line, which the company advertises as being made to the original specifications.[tpl]cite news|title=Increased demand for vintage Dr Martens fuels expansion|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-14341237|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 July 2011[/tpl] Sales of these shoes are low in comparison to those made in Asia, however; in 2010, the factory was producing about 50 pairs per day. In 2005, the R. Griggs company was given an award by the "Institute for Turnaround" for implementing a successful restructure.
Worldwide sales of Dr. Martens shoes grew strongly in the early 2010s, and in 2012 it was assessed as being the eighth fastest-growing British company.[tpl]cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Lauren|title=Dr Martens enjoy comeback with best-selling season ever|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/jul/19/dr-martens-comeback-best-selling?INTCMP=SRCH|accessdate=22 August 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 July 2012[/tpl] Over 100 million pairs of Dr. Martens shoes have been sold from 1960 to 2010, and in 2010, the company offered 250 different models of footwear. The R.
