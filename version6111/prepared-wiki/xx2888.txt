One year after The Downward Spiral release, Reznor produced an accompanying remix album entitled Further Down the Spiral, the only non-major Nine Inch Nails release to be certified gold in the United States. It features contributions from Coil with Danny Hyde, J. G. Thirlwell, electronic musician Aphex Twin, producer Rick Rubin, and Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.[tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=207–208[/tpl] The album peaked at number 23 on the Billboard 200 and received mixed reviews.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=nine inch nails|chart=all[/tpl]|title=Further Down the Spiral [US - Nine Inch Nails|publisher=Billboard[/tpl][tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r315477|label=Further Down the Spiral (US)[/tpl] Recoiled, a remix EP of "Gave Up", "Closer", "The Downward Spiral", and "Eraser" by Coil, was released on February 24, 2014 via British record label Cold Spring.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://exclaim.ca/News/rare_nine_inch_nails_remixes_appear_unearthed_on_coil_ep | title=Rare Nine Inch Nails Remixes Unearthed on Coil EP | work=Exclaim! | date=December 6, 2013 | accessdate=January 17, 2014 | author=Hughes, Josiah[/tpl]
Retrospective reviews regard The Downward Spiral as one of the most important albums of the 1990s and Reznor's greatest work. The 2004 edition of The New Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album five out of five stars and called it "a powerful statement, and one of the landmark albums of the Nineties."[tpl]cite book |chapter=Nine Inch Nails |pages=587–588 |editor1-last=Brackett |editor1-first=Nathan |editor2-last=Hoard |editor1-link=Nathan Brackett |editor2-first=Christian |author-separator= with |first=Mac |last=Randall |title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide |year=2004 |publisher=Fireside |location=London |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 |accessdate=November 4, 2011 [/tpl] Portions posted at [tpl]cite web |work=rollingstone.com |title=Nine Inch Nails > Album Guide |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/nine-inch-nails/albumguide |accessdate=May 21, 2011 [/tpl] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Kyle Anderson remembered watching the music video of "Closer" on MTV as an adolescent and expressed that the album changed his perception of popular music from that of songs heard on the radio to albums with cover art.[tpl]cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2014/03/07/nine-inch-nails-the-downward-spiral-20th-anniversary/|author=Kyle Anderson|title=Nine Inch Nails' 'The Downward Spiral': 20 years of filth and fury|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Warner|date=March 7, 2014|accessdate=March 9, 2014[/tpl] Stereogum[tpl]'[/tpl]s Tom Breihan remains favorable toward the album since it is "the one that most fully inhabits" Nine Inch Nails' characteristics and influenced youth culture, with teenagers wearing ripped fish nets on their arms.

==Controversy==

Its emphasis on transgressive themes made The Downward Spiral[tpl]'[/tpl]s lyrics vulnerable to criticism from American social conservatives. Senate Bob Dole, then head of the Republican Party, sharply  denounced Time Warner after a meeting between Michael J. Fuchs (head of the Warner Music Group), William Bennett, and C. Delores Tucker, at which Tucker and Bennett demanded that Fuchs recite lyrics from "Big Man with a Gun" because they thought the song was an attack on the United States Government.[tpl]cite journal|author=Larry Leibstein with Thomas Rosenstiel|title="The Right Takes a Media Giant to Political Task"|journal=Newsweek|date=June 12, 1995|page=30[/tpl] Interscope was blamed for releasing gangster rap albums by Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur, and Snoop Dogg that were deemed objectionable. Reznor called Tucker (who referred to Nine Inch Nails as a gangster rap act) "such a fucking idiot" and claimed "Big Man with a Gun" was a satire of the genre and was originally about madness. Reznor conceded The Downward Spiral could be "harmful, through implying and subliminally suggesting things," whereas hardcore hip hop can be "cartoonish."[tpl]cite journal |magazine=Spin |volume=11 |issue=11 |date=February 1996 |page=34 |first=Eric |last=Weisbard |title=Sympathy for the Devil |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=td2yO_T3DPEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=November 4, 2011[/tpl] Also posted at [tpl]cite journal |title=Sympathy for the Devil |url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xint8a.shtml |work=theninhotline.net |accessdate=August 20, 2011[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=208–210[/tpl] Robert Bork also repeatedly referenced "Big Man with a Gun" in his book Slouching Toward Gomorrah as evidence of a cultural decline. The book incorrectly states that it is a rap song.[ref]

Before the Columbine High School massacre, two Columbine High School student mass murderers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold referenced lyrics from Nine Inch Nails multiple times in their journals, with the latter specifically naming The Downward Spiral as a symbol of his depression.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2099203/sidebar/2099208/ |work=Slate |title=The Depressive and the Psychopath |first=Dave |last=Cullen |date=April 20, 2004 |accessdate=August 24, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080615143737/http://www.slate.com/id/2099203/sidebar/2099208/  |archivedate=June 15, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://acolumbinesite.com/music.html |title=Music for Columbine High School |publisher=Acolumbinesite.com |accessdate=September 13, 2011 [/tpl] On May 4, 1999, a hearing on the marketing and distribution practices of violent content to minors by the television, music, film, and video game industries was conducted before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.[tpl]cite web |last=O'Connor |first=Christopher |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/513971/19990504/index.jhtml |title=Senators Criticize Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails At Hearing |work=VH1 |publisher=MTV Networks (Viacom) |date=June 4, 1999 |accessdate=May 3, 2011[/tpl] The committee heard testimony from cultural observers, professors, and mental-health professionals that included conservative William Bennett and the Archbishop of Denver, Reverend Charles J.

==Track listing==

To mark the album's tenth anniversary, The Downward Spiral was re-released on November 23, 2004 in high-resolution SACD and DualDisc formats. Disc one of the album's deluxe edition re-release is nearly identical to the original version; track anomalies such as sounds from previous tracks creeping up on start of tracks are fixed, and it includes a stereo and multi-channel SACD layer. The second bonus disc is a collection of remixes and b-sides and also includes a stereo SACD layer in addition to the Redbook CD layer. The last three tracks on the bonus disc are previously unreleased demo recordings from the original album.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/66210/nin-revisits-the-downward-spiral|author=Billboard staff|title=NIN Revisits The Downward Spiral|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=November 2004|accessdate=November 14, 2013[/tpl][tpl]Allmusic|author=Steve Huey|class=album|id=r717657|label=The Downward Spiral (Deluxe Edition)|accessdate=March 29, 2014[/tpl]

The DualDisc edition of The Downward Spiral contains the same CD content on Side A as the Deluxe Edition, with a DVD-Audio layer on Side B. When played on DVD-Video players a Dolby Digital 5.1 multi-channel or Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo mix of The Downward Spiral can be selected, along with videos of "March of the Pigs", "Hurt" and an uncensored video of "Closer". There is also an interactive discography and an image gallery. High resolution 24-bit/48 kHz 5.1 Surround sound and stereo versions of The Downward Spiral can be played on a DVD-Audio player, allowing the user a similar high fidelity experience as the SACD layer of the Deluxe Edition.
