Preliminary results issued on 26 May 2010 showed the Mega Combination winning a plurality of 23 seats of 51, up from 15 in the last election.[tpl]Cite news|title=Former dictator's party ahead in Suriname election|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jMjZD_a0IU0ZSdO7XxuFKEImTP4QD9FUHICO0|accessdate=26 May 2010|newspaper=Associated Press|date=26 May 2010[/tpl] The New Front for Democracy and Development alliance of incumbent President Ronald Venetiaan (who had stated before the election that he would not seek another term) was said to have won 14 seats.  Venetiaan ruled out working together with the NDP as long as it was led by Bouterse. In the upcoming indirect presidential election in July 2010, a two-thirds majority will be required to elect the next president.[tpl]Cite web|author=Kommentar posten |url=http://derstandard.at/1271377526494/Surinam-Partei-Ex-Diktator-Bouterses-gewinnt-Parlamentswahl |title=Partei Ex-Diktator Bouterses gewinnt Parlamentswahl - Surinam - derStandard.at › International |publisher=Derstandard.at |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21[/tpl]  Organisation of American States election observers reported a peaceful election with no irregulaties.
Bouterse has not stated if he will seek to return to the presidency.  Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen has said that the Dutch government will respect the will of the voters of Suriname, despite Bouterse having been sentenced to 11 years in prison by a Dutch court for drug dealing.  An Interpol arrest warrant has been issued for him, but Suriname does not extradite its citizens.[tpl]Cite news|title=Bouterse's past is not forgotten, despite election victory:Verhagen|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2010/05/bouterses_past_is_not_forgotte.php|accessdate=26 May 2010|newspaper=DutchNews.nl|date=26 May 2010[/tpl]
The NDP successfully concluded a coalition deal with Bouterse's former opponents in the civil war, the A Combinatie, giving him a majority in parliament, but not the two-thirds majority required to elect the president.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2010/stories/06/07/bouterse-brunswijk-conclude-successful-coalition-talks/ |title=Bouterse, Brunswijk conclude successful coalition talks |publisher=Stabroek News |date=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2010-08-21[/tpl] Negotiations with the People's Alliance to attain the necessary supermajority reportedly failed after the People's Alliance raised excessive demands.
The NDP fell out with the A Combinatie over the number of cabinet posts, however, and subsequently, the New Front (led by the National Party of Suriname) formed a coalition deal with the A Combinatie and the People's Alliance, giving them 27 seats in parliament, enough to form the government, but too few to elect the president.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-23772--36-36--.html |title=Former Suriname dictator struggling to form new government |publisher=Caribbean Net News |date=2010-06-28 |accessdate=2010-08-21[/tpl] It was seen as a possibility that Bouterse might be elected in the final round of the presidential election (when it goes to the People's Assembly, where the NDP has a majority.[tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010[/tpl]
In a surprise development, Jennifer Geerlings-Simons from the NDP was elected Chairwoman of the House on 30 June 2010 with 26 to 24 votes, even though the anti-NDP parties had a majority in parliament. The NPS's Ruth Wijdenbosch was elected Vice Chairwoman with 25 to 24 votes.[tpl]Cite web|author=Associated Press 2010-07-01 07:27 AM |url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1305899&lang=eng_news |title=Ex-dictator's ally to lead Suriname parliament - Taiwan News Online |publisher=Etaiwannews.com |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2010-08-21[/tpl]
In the run-up to the presidential election on 19 July 2010, Bouterse convinced the A Combinatie to join forces with him, giving him a 30-seat majority; immediately before the election, he succeeded in getting the People's Alliance to join him, giving him the votes required to become president.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/267600/former-suriname-dictator-looks-have-secured-presidency |title=Former Suriname dictator looks to have secured presidency | Manila Bulletin |publisher=Mb.com.ph |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21[/tpl]
