The Youth Citizenship Commission (YCC) is a commission created in the United Kingdom to promote youth participation in the political process and to foster youth education in citizenship. It was created in response to the July 2007 publication of the Governance of Britain Green Paper, which pointed out the need. The thirteen independent Commissioners, headed by chair Professor Jonathon Tonge, oversee the commission. Among the commissioners are three youth participants.
The YCC focuses its attention on individuals between the ages of 11 and 19. In addition to its work with the general youth population, it also focuses on developing healthy concepts of citizenship among disadvantaged populations. It promotes volunteerism as a means of youth engagement and explores with Britain's youth questions of how the government can be more responsive to its needs.
The YCC will report in spring 2009 to the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Justice and the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families.
