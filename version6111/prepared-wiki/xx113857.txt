==Environment==

A complex landscape of mangroves, sandbanks, intertidal sand, mud islands, salt marshes and seagrass beds, the Strait is an important habitat for breeding fish, crustaceans, dugongs, dolphins and marine turtles.  An analysis of commercial catch data in the area between 1988 and 2003 revealed a significant reduction in fish stock.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/australia/qld/sunshine/200511/s1498001.htm |title=Fishing stocks drop in Great Sandy Strait |accessdate=22 January 2011 |date=4 November 2005 |work=ABC News Online |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation [/tpl] The campaign against the Traveston Crossing Dam included claims the dam would have a significant environmental impact on the Great Sandy Strait.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2009/11/14/how-the-Mary-Valley-was-saved/ |title=How the Mary Valley was saved |author=Bill Hoffman |accessdate=22 January 2011 |date=14 November 2009 |newspaper=Sunshine Coast Daily |publisher=APN News & Media [/tpl] Other protected areas within or adjacent to the Strait include Great Sandy National Park, Poona National Park and Great Sandy Conservation Park.

===Birds===

The lower part of Great Sandy Strait was listed under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international significance in 1999.  The area is also an important roosting site for CAMBA and JAMBA listed species.  Some 806 km2 of the strait has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports about 120,000 non-breeding waders, including over 1% of the global populations of Bar-tailed Godwits, Eastern Curlews, Great Knots, Grey-tailed Tattlers, Lesser Sand Plovers, Pied Oystercatchers, Red-necked Stints and Red-capped Plovers, as well as small numbers of the range-restricted Mangrove Honeyeater.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Great Sandy Strait |accessdate=2011-06-29 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= [/tpl]
