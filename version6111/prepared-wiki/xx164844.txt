Budimir Vujačić (born 4 January 1964) is a retired Montenegrin footballer. Mainly a left back, he could also operate as a central defender.

==Club career==

Born in Titograd, Montenegro, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Vujačić grew up in Petrovac na Moru, and began his football career with local outfit OFK Petrovac. In 1985, aged 21, he moved abroad, playing three solid seasons for SC Freiburg in the German second division.
In January 1988, Vujačić returned home and signed with FK Vojvodina where he remained until June 1989, after which he joined national giants FK Partizan. At the Belgrade outfit, he was an everpresent defensive figure (also contributing with 10 league goals during his spell), as the team won one cup and the first edition of the championship after the creation of Serbia and Montenegro, with Partizan leading second-placed neighbours Red Star by 14 points, whilst only conceding 20 goals in 36 matches.
Vujačić then joined Sporting Clube de Portugal, winning the Portuguese Cup in the only season in which he was a regular starter (29 matches, two goals). He retired from football in 1998 at the age of 34, after a short spell in Japan with Vissel Kobe.
Following his retirement, Vujačić served as scout for Manchester United,[tpl]cite news |first=Oliver |last=Kay |title=United on trail of more Serbian talent |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/manchester_united/article5505381.ece |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |location=London |date=13 January 2009 |accessdate=9 March 2009 [/tpl] and was responsible for bringing Zoran Tošić and Adem Ljajić to the club's attention.[tpl]cite journal |first=Jonathan |last=Wilson |date=April 2009 |title=They came from Serbia |journal=Inside United |issue=201 |page=41 |publisher=Haymarket Network |location=Teddington |issn=1749-6497 [/tpl]
