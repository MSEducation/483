The 1977 English cricket season was played out in the aftermath of the Kerry Packer affair.  Geoffrey Boycott returned to Test cricket and managed to time things so that he scored his 100th career century in the Headingley Test.  An Australian team that was clearly affected by Packer proved to be no match for an England side that stayed together despite the controversy.
