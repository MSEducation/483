==Career==

Kotysch joined 1. FC Kaiserslautern in 2000 as a youth player having moved from regional team SV Gauersheim. In the 2006â€“07 season, he played for the reserve team of FCK. He made such a good impression in the second string that former manager Wolfgang Wolf gave him his first team debut. In his first season he only played eight times for the first team but recently has had a more important role to play and thus was rewarded with his first professional contract.
