Political parties became legal in mid-1992 after a ten-year hiatus. There are 20 political parties under the Fourth Republic; the main ones are, the National Democratic Congress, successor to Jerry John Rawlings' original ruling organ Provisional National Defence Council, which has been the incumbent government of Ghana for 32 years between 1981 to 2012; the New Patriotic Party, founded in 1992, which has been the incumbent government of Ghana for 8 years, winning presidential and parliamentary elections elections in 2000 and 2004, and is successor to the Gold Coast's The Big Six independence achiever party United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC); the People's National Convention, and the Convention People's Party, successor to Kwame Nkrumah's original party of the same name, which was the incumbent government of Ghana for 10 years, from declaration of independence in 1957 to 1966, winning elections in 1956, 1960, and 1965.

===Administrative divisions===

There are ten administrative regions of the Republic of Ghana which are divided into 6 metropolitan assemblies; 55 Municipal assemblies; and 216 districts,[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/about-ghana/ghana-at-a-glance |title=Ghana at a glance|accessdate=1 June 2013|date= |work= ghana.gov.gh |publisher=Government of Ghana[/tpl] each with its own district assembly. Below districts are various types of councils, including 58 town or area councils; 108 zonal councils; and 626 area councils. Sixteen thousand unit committees exist on the lowest level. Ghana has 275 electoral constituencies.

===Judicial system===

The legal system is based on British common law, customary (traditional) law, and the 1992 constitution. Court hierarchy consists of Supreme Court of Ghana (highest court), courts of appeal, and high courts of justice. Beneath these bodies are circuit, magisterial, and traditional courts. Extrajudicial institutions include public tribunals. Since independence, courts are relatively independent; this independence continues under the Republic. Lower courts are being redefined and reorganised under the Republic.

===Foreign relations===

Since independence, Ghana has been devoted to ideals of nonalignment and is a founding member of the non-aligned movement. Ghana favours international and regional political and economic co-operation, and is an active member of the United Nations and the African Union.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.int/ghana/ |title=Official page of Nations Permanent Mission of Ghana to the United Nations|accessdate=20 May 2012 |date=20 September 2011 |work=Author: un.int|publisher=United Nations[/tpl]
