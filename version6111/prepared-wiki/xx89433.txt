==Purpose of the Act==

The stated purpose of the Act was: "A bill to prohibit an individual from knowingly opening, maintaining, managing, controlling, renting, leasing, making available for use, or profiting from any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using any controlled substance, and for other purpose."See text of statute.

==Substantive law changes of the Act==

The Act would have modified section 416(a) of the Controlled Substances Act (also known as the "crackhouse law" and codified at United States Code, [tpl]usc|21|856(a)[/tpl]) to expand the section regarding "Establishment of manufacturing operations", which previously outlawed maintaining, managing or owning any place used to manufacture, distribute or use drugs to include temporary or permanent uses of the premises.
The Act also would have created a civil penalty of $250,000 or "2 times the gross receipts, either known or estimated, that were derived from each violation that is attributable to the person.", whichever was greater.  Additionally, the Act recommended that the United States Sentencing Commission reconsider the then-current Federal sentencing guidelines with respect to offenses involving Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid, commonly known as a date rape drug.

==Public commentary on the Act==

Most of the public commentary regarding the RAVE Act centered on the prologue section of the bill titled "Findings." [tpl]cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,58663,00.html | publisher=Fox News |title=Raving Lunacy|date=July 25, 2002[/tpl] Such sections do not create new substantive law and serve only as guidance to the judiciary in interpreting the law and the executive in enforcing the law. Among the items listed in the "Findings" section include statements regarding rave promoters providing "chill rooms" and bottled water for large fees, where participants can go and cool down from the body-temperature-raising effects of ecstasy; and selling "neon glow sticks; massage oils; menthol nasal inhalers; and pacifiers that are used to combat the involuntary teeth clenching associated with ecstasy."
Specifically, many were concerned that these expansive definitions might permit the police to arrest and charge concert promoters under this law so long as glow sticks and bottled water were present. "RAVE Act: RIP Live Electronic Music", Kuro5hin.org, July 7, 2002  Congress was also accused of picking an easy, public target so as to continue support for the War on Drugs.  Others were concerned that too much responsibility would be placed on concert promoters to police their patrons."Chemical Warfare: The RAVE Act", AlterNet, October 8, 2002  Also, many were concerned that their First Amendment right to freedom of assembly would be violated were the law enacted.http://www.law.indiana.edu
