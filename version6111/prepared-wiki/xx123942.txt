==History==

The Augustinians acquired the Casanova School founded by Doña Soledad Locsin on August 9, 1961. On July 8, 1962, the Casanova School ceased to be and became Colegio de San Agustin de Bacolod. The broadened educational program envisioned by the Augustinian administrators paved the way for the school to offer kindergarten, elementary and high school education.
Construction of the administration building along North Drive and 20th Street commenced in May 1963; it was inaugurated later that same year. On July 19, 1964, the College Department opened with curricular offerings ranging from Liberal Arts, Education, Commerce, Secretarial and technology courses such as Chemical and Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry and Medical Technology, which were not being offered in other schools in Bacolod City at that time.
The school's student population doubled after the College Department opened in 1964, and the administrators built a four-storey building along 18th Street. Construction of this building began in early 1969 and it was inaugurated during the Christmas season of that year. This building, which is called the College Building, was then the site of the Grade School and High School Department, the Audio-Visual Center and some offices of the deans of the departments.
The school opened the College of Nursing in 1970, its most prominent alumna to date being singer Kuh Ledesma.[tpl]cite news | last = | first = | title =Homecoming  at San Agustin-Bacolod | pages = | publisher =The Visayan Daily Star | date = 2007-08-26 |url =http://www.visayandailystar.com/2007/Starlife/2007/August/26/feature2.htm | accessdate = 2008-06-08[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title =Cultural Heritage:Kuh Ledesma | url=http://www.globalpinoy.com/ch/ch_category.php?category=pinoymusicians&name=Kuh%20Ledesma&table=ch_pinoymusicians&startpage=16&endpage=30 | accessdate = 2008-06-08[/tpl]
In the 1990s, the school's name was simplified to Colegio San Agustin – Bacolod.

==Vision==

An Augustinian academic and evangelizing community providing quality Filipino and Christian Catholic education.

==Mission==

Colegio San Agustin – Bacolod is a Catholic, Filipino, Augustinian school committed to fulfilling the mission of the Church by providing a well-rounded formation of the human person with respect to his ultimate goal; by developing moral and social values and love for country; and by fostering a community life characterized by "oneness of mind and heart on the way to God" anchored on the Augustinian motto "Virtus et Scientia".

==Patron Saint==

The College is named in honor of the 4th century saint, St. Augustine of Hippo. Augustine was a key figure in the doctrinal development of Western Christianity and is often referred to as a "Doctor of the Church" by Roman Catholics. Two of his surviving works, namely "The Confessions" (his autobiography) and "The City of God", are regarded as Western Classics. Augustine is often considered to be one of the theological fountainheads of Reformation, because of his teaching on salvation and grace; Martin Luther himself also having been an Augustinian friar. Augustine was not a Biblical fundamentalist.
Other English-speaking Augustinian schools with the same patron include the University of San Agustin, Colegio San Agustin - Makati and Colegio San Agustin - Biñan in the Philippines, St. Augustine's College, Brookvale in Sydney, Australia, St. Augustine College Preparatory School, Richland, New Jersey; St. Augustine High School, San Diego, California; and Austin Preparatory School in Reading, Massachusetts - all three in the United States; St Augustine College in Malta,  and Irish ones in Dungarvan, and New Ross.
