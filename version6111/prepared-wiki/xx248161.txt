==History==

Rafael Gomez (1784-1838), born in Mexico, came to California in 1830 as a legal advisor to Governor Manuel Victoria.  In 1831, he married Joséfa Antonia Estrada (1813-1890), a daughter of José Mariano Estrada, grantee of Rancho Buena Vista.  Gomez was a supporter of Figueroa, but resigned his position, and was granted the six square league Rancho Tularcitos in 1834.  He held public offices in Monterey in 1835-36. Rafael Gomez died in an accident on Rancho Tularcitos in 1838.
