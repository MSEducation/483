[[Operon]]

CATEGORIES: Gene expression

In genetics, an operon is a functioning unit of genomic DNA containing a cluster of genes under the control of a single promoter.[tpl]cite book|title=Life: The Science of Biology|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|edition=9th|isbn=978-1-4292-1962-4|page=349|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ANT8VB14oBUC&pg=PA349|author=Sadava, David et al.[/tpl] The genes are transcribed together into an mRNA strand and either translated together in the cytoplasm, or undergo trans-splicing to create monocistronic mRNAs that are translated separately, i.e. several strands of mRNA that each encode a single gene product. The result of this is that the genes contained in the operon are either expressed together or not at all. Several genes must be co-transcribed to define an operon.[ref]

Originally, operons were thought to exist solely in prokaryotes, but since the discovery of the first operons in eukaryotes in the early 1990s,[tpl]cite pmid|8098272[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid| 9155028 [/tpl] more evidence has arisen to suggest they are more common than previously assumed.[tpl]cite doi|10.1093/bfgp/3.3.199[/tpl] In general, expression of prokaryotic operons leads to the generation of polycistronic mRNAs, while eukaryotic operons lead to monocistronic mRNAs.
Operons are also found in viruses such as bacteriophages.[tpl]cite web| title=Definition of Operon| url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32917| work=Medical Dictionary| publisher=MedicineNet.com| accessdate=30 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Displacements of Prohead Protease Genes in the Late Operons of Double-Stranded-DNA Bacteriophages|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|date=1 March 2004|url=http://jb.asm.org/content/186/13/4369.short|accessdate=30 December 2012[/tpl] For example, T7 phages have two operons—the first one codes for various products including a special T7 RNA polymerase which can bind to and transcribe the second operon—which includes a lysis gene meant to cause the host cell to burst.[tpl]cite web|title=Bacteriophage Use Operons|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~cbbc/courses/bio4/bio4-lectures/ProkGeneControl.html|work=Prokaryotic Gene Control|publisher=Dartmouth College|accessdate=30 December 2012[/tpl]

==History==

The term "operon" was first proposed in a short paper in the Proceedings of the French Academy of Science in 1960.[tpl]cite pmid|14406329[/tpl] From this paper, the so-called general theory of the operon was developed. This theory suggested that in all cases, genes within an operon are negatively controlled by a repressor acting at a single operator located before the first gene. Later, it was discovered that genes could be positively regulated and also regulated at steps that follow transcription initiation. Therefore, it is not possible to talk of a general regulatory mechanism, because different operons have different mechanisms. Today, the operon is simply defined as a cluster of genes transcribed into a single mRNA molecule.  Nevertheless, the development of the concept is considered a landmark event in the history of molecular biology. The first operon to be described was the lac operon in E. coli.[tpl]Cite pmid| 14406329[/tpl]  The 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine was awarded to François Jacob, André Michel Lwoff and Jacques Monod for their discoveries concerning the operon and virus synthesis.

==Overview==

Operons occur primarily in prokaryotes but also in some eukaryotes, including nematodes such as C. elegans and the fly, Drosophila melanogaster. rRNA genes often exist in operons that have been found in a range of eukaryotes including chordates. An operon is made up of several structural genes arranged under a common promoter and regulated by a common operator. It is defined as a set of adjacent structural genes, plus the adjacent regulatory signals that affect transcription of the structural genes.5[tpl]cite book |author=Miller JH, Suzuki DT, Griffiths AJF, Lewontin RC, Wessler SR, Gelbart WM |title=Introduction to genetic analysis |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2005 |pages=740 |isbn=0-7167-4939-4 |edition=8th [/tpl] The regulators of a given operon, including repressors, corepressors, and activators, are not necessarily coded for by that operon. The location and condition of the regulators, promoter, operator and structural DNA sequences can determine the effects of common mutations.
Operons are related to regulons, stimulons and modulons; whereas operons contain a set of genes regulated by the same operator, regulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single regulatory protein, and stimulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single cell stimulus.  According to its authors, the term "operon" means "to operate".[tpl]cite pmid| 21566161[/tpl]

==As a unit of transcription==

An operon contains one or more structural genes which are generally transcribed into one polycistronic mRNA (a single mRNA molecule that codes for more than one protein). However, the definition of an operon does not require the mRNA to be polycistronic, though in practice, it usually is.[tpl]cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=Thomas|title=Operons in Eukaryotes|journal=Brief Funct Genomic Proteomic,|year=2004|volume=3|issue=3|pages=199–211|doi=10.1093/bfgp/3.3.199|pmid=15642184[/tpl] Upstream of the structural genes lies a promoter sequence which provides a site for RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription. Close to the promoter lies a section of DNA called an operator.
