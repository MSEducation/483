==Early life and education==

Angell is the son of Katharine Sergeant Angell White, The New Yorker’s first fiction editor, and the stepson of renowned essayist E. B. White, but was raised for the most part by his father, Ernest Angell, an attorney who became head of the American Civil Liberties Union.[tpl]cite news|title=Roger Angell As Lively As Ever at Age 85|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/baseball/mlb/wires/05/17/2010.ap.bbo.roger.angell.adv21.1306/|newspaper=Sports Illustrated|date=17 May 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Ulin|first=David L.|title=Roger Angell on What the Dead Don't Know|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/15/entertainment/la-et-jc-roger-angell-new-yorker-20121115|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=15 November 2012[/tpl]Chris Smith, "Influences: Roger Angell", New York Magazine May 21, 2006.
Angell is a 1938 graduate of the Pomfret School and attended Harvard University.Richard Orodenker, Twentieth-Century American Sportswriters, Dictionary of Literary Biography Volume 171, Detroit: Gale, 1996, ISBN 0-8103-9934-2, p. 5. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II.

==Career==

Angell's earliest published works were pieces of short fiction and personal narratives. Several of these pieces were collected in The Stone Arbor and Other Stories (1960) and A Day in the Life of Roger Angell (1970).
He first contributed to The New Yorker in March, 1944.
He first wrote professionally about baseball in 1962, when William Shawn, editor of The New Yorker, had him travel to Florida to write about spring training.
Angell has been called the "Poet Laureate of baseball" but dislikes the term. In a review of Once More Around the Park for the Journal of Sport History, Richard C. Crepeau wrote that "Gone for Good", Angell's essay on the career of Steve Blass, "may be the best piece that anyone has ever written on baseball or any other sport".vol. 29 number 3, pp. 510-12 (pdf). Angell was one of several personalities who gave commentaries throughout the Ken Burns series, Baseball, in 1994.
One of the most striking items from Angell's essays is one ultimately published in Season Ticket, involving a spring training trip to see the Baltimore Orioles, where he interviews Earl Weaver, then the manager of the Orioles, about Cal Ripken, Jr., who was about to start his rookie season. Angell quotes Weaver as saying about Ripken that, at whichever position the team decides (between shortstop and third base), "his manager can just write his name into the lineup every day for the next fifteen years; that's how good he is". Starting that year, Ripken in fact was written into lineups every day for more than fifteen years, setting the all-time consecutive-games-played streak of 2,632 games. Angell's quotation of Weaver stands as one of the most incredibly prescient (and well-documented) "first-guesses" in recorded literature.

==Personal life==

Angell has three children, Callie, Alice, and John Henry. He had the two girls with his first wife Evelyn, and John Henry with Carol. Callie Angell, who was an authority on the films of Andy Warhol, committed suicide on May 5, 2010, in Manhattan, where she worked as a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art; she was 62. Alice Angell lives in Portland, Maine, and John Henry Angell lives in Portland, Oregon.
His second wife, Carol Rogge Angell, to whom he was married for 48 years, died on April 10, 2012, of metastatic breast cancer at the age of 73.[tpl]cite news|title=Paid Notice: Deaths, Angell, Carol Rogge|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06EFDD1F3AF937A25757C0A9649D8B63|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=14 April 2012[/tpl]
