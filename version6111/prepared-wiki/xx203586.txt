The [tpl]Nihongo|KiHa E200|キハE200形[/tpl] is a single-car hybrid diesel multiple unit (DMU) train type operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) on the Koumi Line in Japan. Three cars were delivered in April 2007, entering revenue service from 31 July 2007.
The body design is based on the earlier KiHa E130 series DMUs, but with two single doors per side instead of three pairs of doors. 
The cars incorporate hybrid diesel/battery technology developed on the earlier "NE Train" experimental hybrid car, and were intended to operate for a period of two years on the Koumi Line to evaluate the viability for full-scale fleet operation.
Two cars are normally used together on [tpl]Nihongo|Koumi|こうみ[/tpl] services on the line.

==Hybrid operation cycle==

On starting from standstill, energy stored in lithium-ion batteries is used to drive the motors, with the engine cut out. The engine then cuts in for further acceleration and running on gradients. When running down gradients, the motor acts as a generator, recharging the batteries. The engine is also used for braking.[tpl]cite journal| last = Nishiwaki| first = Kōji| title = JR各社の新世代気動車の現状　JR北海道キハ160形 JR東日本キハE200形| trans_title = The Current Situation of JR Group Modern DMUs: JR Hokkaido KiHa 160 & JR East KiHa E200| journal = Japan Railfan Magazine | volume = 51| issue = 606| page = p.96–101| publisher = Kōyūsha Co., Ltd.| location = Japan | date = October 2011| url = | doi = | id = [/tpl]
