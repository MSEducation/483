Zino is a Greek social networking website. In 2009, it was ranked one of the top Greek social destinations.

==History==

Zino started as a continuation of a news-focused Greek network, chit-chat.gr, which was established in 2005, and eventually replaced it.[tpl]citation|url=http://dionyziz.zino.gr/journals/Zino|title=Zino, the name|accessdate=2009-04-25[/tpl] Three codenames were publicly announced for the launched versions, Reloaded,[tpl]citation|url=http://dionyziz.zino.gr/journals/Chit-Chat_Reloaded|title=Chit-Chat Reloaded|accessdate=2009-04-25[/tpl] the first version announced, Phoenix,[tpl]citation|url=http://dionyziz.zino.gr/journals/Zino_Phoenix|title=Zino Phoenix|accessdate=2009-04-25[/tpl] the version that established it as a social network in Greece, and lastly Revolution, the current version.

==Features==

===User profiles===

Each user has a user profile in the form of http://username.zino.gr/, where username is a chosen nickname by the user. The user profile lists several user details, among others their gender, age, and other personal information. It also exhibits several user-generated sections of content such as recent journals, polls, answers, photos, and the user's music preferences.[tpl]citation|url=http://zinewsusto.blogspot.com/2009/04/no-surprise-there.html|title=Zinews: No surprise there|accessdate=2009-04-25[/tpl]

===Photo albums===

The users are given the opportunity to upload photos of themselves or other pictures they have taken to their user profile. These pictures are separated into albums, which the user can specify. Zino claims about 140,000 photos.[tpl]citation|url=http://dionyziz.zino.gr/journals/Merika_statistika|title=Zino statistics|accessdate=2009-04-25[/tpl]

===Friends===

Like in most social networks, users can add people as their friends. Their friends are listed on their user profile accordingly.

===Journals===

Each user has a personal collection of articles that they can publish under the user profile. This collection is called "journals", and is publicly available for anyone to read.[tpl]citation|url=http://greekwebwatch.blogspot.com/2008/12/zinogr.html|title=Greek Web Watch: Zino.gr|accessdate=2009-04-25[/tpl]

===Questions and answers===

Each user is asked several personal questions while using the web application, allowing him to provide an answer or skip the question. These answers are then publicly available on the user's profile for other users to see, a feature that allows the owner to reveal numerous details about themselves.

===Polls===

Users are provided with the ability to raise a question on their user profile, which other users can then answer. This feature is available through polls, for which the user must specify a question and the possible answers. Commentary is furthermore available on poll pages after their creation.

==Criticism==

===Greeklish===

Zino has no regulations over the use of Greeklish. This has yielded to the extensive use of Greeklish, making it hard to read for people not familiar with the language. This policy of the website has been heavily criticized. Various campaigns have sprung to support or defend the usage of Greeklish with the website over time.[tpl]citation|url=http://izual.zino.gr/polls/Eiste_uper_tou_na_grafoume_ellinika_sto_zino_kai_oxi_greeklish|title=Είστε υπερ του να γράφουμε ελληνικά στο zino και όχι greeklish?|accessdate=2009-04-25[/tpl]

===Data retention===

Another controversy of the website was the inability to delete user accounts,[tpl]citation|url=http://static.zino.gr/revolution/legal/tos.html|title=Zino terms of service|accessdate=2009-04-25[/tpl] but this feature was later added [tpl]citation|url=http://dionyziz.zino.gr/journals/Neoi_Oroi_Xrisis___|title=Νέοι όροι χρήσης|accessdate=2010-05-27[/tpl] after the users' request. The inability to remove comments after they have been posted, a feature also long requested by users, still remains a controversy.
