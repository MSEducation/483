==History==

Operations began in the 1990s. Its orebody and viability was ascertained from earlier exploration in the area during the 1970s when the priority was for other forms of mineralization within the Mount Read Volcanic Belt.
The Henty Gold Mine was operated by Barrick Gold - currently the largest gold producing company in the world, which acquired the mine through the takeover of Placer Dome in 2006. The Henty mine was expected to close on or before November 2009, with subsequent rehabilitation, due to depletion of ore reserves.
Henty Gold was acquired by Bendigo Mining mid-2009. Bendigo specialise in small scale operations and expect to extend the mine's life and also own the Kangaroo Flat Mine at Bendigo.Bendigo Mining website: Henty The mine continued to operate under Bendigo, producing 43,178 ounces of gold in the 2009-10 financial year, after investing A$3.8 million into mining equipment for the mine.FY10 gold production of 79,827 ounces Bendigo Mining website, published: 9 July 2010, accessed: 19 July 2010
