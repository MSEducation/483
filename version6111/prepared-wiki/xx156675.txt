CATEGORIES: Tennis court surfaces

Plexicushion is an acrylic-based hard court tennis surface and one of the surface types used on the professional Association of Tennis Professionals and Women's Tennis Association tour. It is manufactured and sold by Plexipave, a company based in Massachusetts, USA.

==Description==

According to the Plexipave website there are four different types of Plexicushion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.plexipave.com/tennis/plexicushion.html |title=Plexicushion Tennis Court Surface Products |publisher=Plexipave.com |date=2008-01-13 |accessdate=23 April 2012[/tpl] They are Prestige, Competition, Tournament and 2000.
The Plexicushion systems consist of a Plexicushion substrate (which is a blend of latex, rubber, and plastic particles) and the 100% acrylic Plexipave Surface.

==Australian Open==

On 30 May 2007 the Australian Open and Tennis Australia announced Plexicushion Prestige as the new Australian Open surface, replacing the Rebound Ace surface that had been in use since Melbourne Park was opened in 1988. The surface was installed in time for the 2008 Australian Open, and was accompanied by a change in surfaces at the lead-up tournaments to the Australian Open.[tpl]cite news|title=On-court blues for Aussie tennis?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/7178646.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 September 2012|date=11 January 2008|first=Chris|last=Bevan[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Shades of blue for summer|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/shades-of-blue-for-summer/story-e6frg7mo-1111114554756|publisher=The Australian|accessdate=10 September 2012|date=3 October 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=On the surface, Australian Open gets a new bounce|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/sports/13iht-srtennis.5.9176593.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=10 September 2012|date=13 January 13, 2008|first=Christopher|last=Clarey[/tpl]
Among the men, Novak Djokovic is the most successful player on Plexicushion, with all of his four Australian Open titles (2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013) coming on Plexicushion. Serena Williams (2009 and 2010) and Victoria Azarenka (2012 and 2013) are the most successful women, both winning two Australian Open titles on this surface.

==Effect for a Tennis Match==

Plexicushion bounces lower and more predictably than the hard court surface previously used by the Australian Open before 2008, Rebound Ace. Because of this, Plexicushion creates safer matches with fewer variables than Rebound Ace.
