KIDY, virtual channel 6, is a television station in San Angelo, Texas, broadcasting locally on digital channel 19 as a Fox affiliate, and is owned by London Broadcasting. The station broadcasts its digital signal on UHF channel 19, which maps to its former VHF analog channel 6. While the station's over-the-air analog channel number is 6, it is sometimes referred to as FOX 10 because channel 10 is the station's designation on all cable systems in the area.  MyNetworkTV programming can be seen on KIDY's digital subchannel 19.2 (virtual channel 6.2) and is branded as My San Angelo.

==History==

KIDY began broadcasting on May 12, 1984 as an independent station. It became a charter affiliate of the Fox television network on April 5, 1987. In 2008, KIDY was purchased by Bayou City Broadcasting in a group deal for approximately $3 million.
On September 27, 2012, Bayou City Broadcasting announced an agreement to sell KXVA and its seven other television stations to London Broadcasting Company (the sale price initially was not disclosed). The sale marks a temporary exit from the broadcasting industry for the company's owner DuJuan McCoy, who plans on refocusing his company to acquire major network affiliates in mid-sized markets larger than San Angelo and Abilene.Temporary Exit With Fox Duo Sale by McCoy, TVNewsCheck, September 27, 2012.

==Newscasts==

KIDY presently broadcasts 2Â½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with a half-hour on weekdays; the station does not produce newscasts on Saturdays and Sundays). The station originally operated a news department from 1984 until it was shut down in 1988. KIDY would not broadcast news programming again until 2009, with the addition of a simulcast of Fox News at Nine, an hour-long evening newscast from San Antonio Fox affiliate KABB (channel 29); the newscast aired every night at 9 p.m., except in the case of Fox programming overruns due to network sports coverage. The following year in October 2010, the station began simulcasting KABB's four-hour morning newscast, Fox News First; the newscast airs weekday mornings from 5:00 to 9:00 a.m.
In addition to local news headline updates airing during Fox News at Nine and Fox News First, KIDY provides hourly local news updates weekdays between 9:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., with headlines and news information provided by the San Angelo Standard-Times newspaper.
On January 20, 2014, KIDY debuted a half-hour primetime newscast at 9:30 p.m. on weeknights from its downtown studios in San Angelo, Texas. All simulcasts of KABB newscasts were dropped with the morning news simulcast being replaced by other programming including The Texas Daily and The Broadcast, news and interview programs produced by its Dallas sister station KTXD-TV.
