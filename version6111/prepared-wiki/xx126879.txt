Random Killing is a Canadian punk rock band from Toronto who were assembled initially as a joke in 1984. Their original name was Roy's Comrades, which was a nod to Roy McMurtry, Attorney General of Ontario at the time. After writing a few decent songs, the band decided to record and stay together.  In 1995, their song "12," from Thoughts of Aggression (Raw Energy 1994), was re-recorded at CBC Studios and released as an animated video by Sesame Park and subsequently picked up by Sesame Street where it aired internationally for almost a decade.  In 1998, the band performed live on CTV's Open Mike with Mike Bullard.  The band performs mainly in Ontario and Quebec but have toured Canada in past. They have performed with bands such as Ripcordz, Armed and Hammered, Dayglo Abortions, GBH, Agnostic Front, Bad Brains, Propagandhi, D.O.A., UK Subs, Bunchofuckingoofs, Coffin Break, and Submachine to name a few.  Their song "Undertaker", was featured in a 2008 Space (TV channel) documentary titled "Zombiemania".
