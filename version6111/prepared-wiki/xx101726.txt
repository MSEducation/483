Many D-proteins and other D-peptides

When placed in a nonchiral solvent like water, D-peptides, as well as the larger polypeptide D-proteins, 
have similar but mirrored properties to the L-peptides and L-proteins
with identical sequences.  If an L-protein does not require a Chaperone or a structural cofactor to fold, its
D-enantiomer protein should have a mirror image conformation with respect to the L-protein (Figure 1).  A D-enzyme should act on substrates of reverse chirality compared to the L-enzyme with the same sequence.  Similarly, if an L-peptide binds to an L-protein, their D-peptide and D-protein counterparts
should bind together in a mirrored way.[tpl]cite journal |author=Milton RC, Milton SC, Kent SB |title=Total chemical synthesis of a D-enzyme: the enantiomers of HIV-1 protease show demonstration of reciprocal chiral substrate specificity|journal=Science|volume=256|pages=1445–1448|year=1992  | doi = 10.1126/science.1604320 [/tpl]
D-peptides also have properties that make them attractive as drugs.  D-peptides are less susceptible to be degraded in the stomach or inside cells by 
proteolysis. D-peptide drugs can therefore be taken orally and are effective for a longer period of time.  D-peptides are
easy to synthesize, when compared to many other drugs.  In some cases, D-peptides can have a low immunogenic response.[tpl]cite journal |author=Welch BD, VanDemark AP, Heroux A, Hill CP, Kay MS.|title=Potent D-peptide inhibitors of HIV-1 entry.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104|issue=43|pages=16828–16833|year=2007  |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/43/16828.full |pmid=17942675 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0708109104 |pmc=2040420[/tpl]

===Methods to design D-peptides===

====Ret design====

An L-peptide has three analogue sequences (Figure 2) built from L and D amino acids: the D-enantiomer or inverso-peptide with the same sequence, but composed of D-amino
acids and a mirror conformation; the retro-peptide, consisting of the same sequence of L amino acids but in reverse order; and the 
retro-inverso or D-retro-enantiomer peptide, consisting of D-amino acids in the reversed sequence.[tpl]cite journal |author=Guichard G, Benkirane N, Zeder-Lutz G, van Regenmortel MH, Briand JP, Muller S.|title=Antigenic mimicry of natural L-peptides with retro-inverso-peptidomimetics|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=91|issue=21 |pages= 9765–9769|year=1994  |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/91/21/9765.abstract[/tpl]

While the L-peptide and its D-enantiomer are mirror structures of each other, the L-retro-peptide is the mirror image of the D-retro-inverso-peptide.
On the other hand, the L-peptide and the D-retro-inverso-peptide share a similar arrangement of side-chains, although their carboxyl and amino groups
point in opposing directions.  For small peptides that do not depend on a secondary structure for binding, an L-peptide and its D-retro-inverso-peptide is likely to have
a similar binding affinity with a target L-protein.
