The University of London International Programmes is a division of the University of London that manages external study programmes. Several colleges and institutes of the University of London offer degrees through the programme, including  Birkbeck, Goldsmiths, Heythrop College, Institute of Education, King's College London, London School of Economics, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway, Royal Veterinary College, School of Oriental and African Studies, and University College London.
The System offers courses of study for undergraduate and postgraduate diplomas and degrees to more than 50,000 students around the world."About Us", University of London International Programmes Website http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/about_us/index.shtml A designated constituent institution of the University of London, called the "lead college", creates materials to allow students to study at their own pace.

==History==

The institution that later became known as University College London was established in 1828, calling itself 'London University', although without official recognition of university status.  The institution - following the Scottish model in curriculum and teaching - was non-denominational and, given the intense religious rivalries at the time, there was an outcry against the "godless" university. The issue soon boiled down to which institutions had degree-granting powers and which institutions did not.[tpl]cite web|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0018-2680%28198824%2928%3A4%3C627%3ASADT%22H%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J |title=Sheldon Rothblatt, "Review: Supply and Demand: The Two Histories of English Education", History of Education Quarterly, Vol. 28, No. 4., Winter, 1988, pp. 627-644 |publisher=Links.jstor.org |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl] The compromise solution that emerged in 1836 was that the sole authority to conduct the examinations leading to degrees would be given to a new officially recognised entity called the "University of London", which would act as examining body for the University of London colleges, originally University College London and King's College London, and award their students University of London degrees. As Sheldon Rothblatt states, "thus arose in nearly archetypal form the famous English distinction between teaching and examining, here embodied in separate institutions." With the state giving examining powers to a separate entity, the groundwork was laid for the creation of a programme within the new university that would both administer examinations and award qualifications to students taking instruction at another institution or pursuing a course of self-directed study.
Referred to as "People's University" by Charles Dickens because it provided access to higher education to students from less affluent backgrounds, the External Programme was chartered by Queen Victoria in 1858, making the University of London the first university to offer distance learning degrees to students.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.londonexternal.ac.uk/about_us/history.shtml |title="History", University of London External Programme Website |publisher=Londonexternal.ac.uk |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.londonexternal.ac.uk/about_us/facts.shtml |title="Key Facts", University of London External Programme Website |publisher=Londonexternal.ac.uk |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl]
Enrolment increased steadily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and during the Second World War there was a further increase in enrolments from soldiers stationed abroad as well as soldiers imprisoned in German POW camps.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardianabroad.co.uk/education/article/283 |author=Tatum Anderson |title=History lessons at the people's university| date=16 May 2007 |publisher=Guardianabroad.co.uk |accessdate=2010-04-27 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.guardianabroad.co.uk/education/article/283 | archivedate= 24 May 2007[/tpl] Because the Geneva Convention (1929) stipulated that every prisoner of war, in addition to being entitled to adequate food and medical care, had the right to exchange correspondence and receive parcels, many British POWs took advantage of this opportunity and enrolled in the University of London External Programme. The soldiers were sent study materials by mail, and at specified intervals sat for proctored exams in the camps. Almost 11,000 exams were taken at 88 camps between 1940 and 1945. Though the failure rate was high, substantial numbers of soldiers earned degrees while imprisoned.
With the advent of inexpensive airmail services after the war, the number of external students taking University of London courses increased dramatically. The University of London International Programmes commemorated its 150th anniversary in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.londonexternal.ac.uk/150/index.shtml |title=150th Anniversary - microsite |publisher=Londonexternal.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl] A specially commissioned anniversary book was produced to mark the occasion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.londonexternal.ac.uk/150/book/index.shtml |title=150th Anniversary - microsite |publisher=Londonexternal.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl]

==Current system==

The System offers courses of study for undergraduate and postgraduate diplomas and degrees to more than 50,000 students around the world. A designated constituent institution of the University of London, called the "lead college", creates materials to allow students to study at their own pace. Examinations take place at testing centres around the world on specified dates. Hallmarks of the programme are its low cost in comparison to attendance in London, and the possibility of pursuing either full-time or part-time study.As stated in the University of London Statutes, International Programmes students are graded on the same standard as internal students to ensure a uniform credentialing process. A student who completes a course of study under the program is awarded a University of London degree with a notation specifying which lead college provided the instruction.
Students enrolled in the University of London International Programmes are members of the University of London. International Programmes Students are however not full members of University of London Union and have very limited student representation within the University. There are also differences over the status International Programmes Students have with respect to their lead college. Some institutions co-register their International Programmes Students as college members (e.g. SOAS, LSHTM), in addition to their status as University of London member. However, other colleges deny International Programmes Students membership status and privileges when they are present in London (e.g. LSE). Academics at the University of London are responsible for the academic direction of the International Programmes. When the International Programmes was audited in 2005 by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), the auditors concluded that "broad confidence" could be placed in the University's management and the awards made through the External System ("broad confidence" is "the best verdict any institution can be given by the auditors").University of London Press Release, "Vote of confidence in delivering world-wide education for the University of London", 10 April 2006 http://www.londonexternal.ac.uk/news_events/archive/docs/ext_prog_press_06.pdf
Most International Programmes Students are in former territories of the British Empire.

===Name changes===

In November 2007, the University of London External Programme became known as the University of London External System.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/news_events/archive/index.shtml |title=University of London External System - News & Events » News archive |publisher=londonexternal.ac.uk |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl] In August 2010, the name was once again changed to University of London International Programmes in response to feedback that the programme needed a clear, simpler and more inclusive name that described what the University of London offered to almost 50,000 students in 180 countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/renaming/faqs.shtml |title=University of London International Programmes - External System renamed - FAQs |publisher=londonexternal.ac.uk |date=2010-07-30 |accessdate=2010-08-02[/tpl]

===Participating colleges and institutes of the University of London===

One of the lead colleges, Imperial College London, left the University in July 2007. The School of Oriental and African Studies has become the lead college for the external degrees previously led by Imperial, while Imperial will offer its own distance learning MBA in competition with the two MBAs offered by International Programmes, led by SOAS and Royal Holloway.

===Independent teaching institutions===

In Europe, North America, the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia many students participating in University of London International Programmes seek out tuition at one of the more than 150 private or non-profit institutionsOur global reputation | University of London International Programmes.

Starting August 2010, the External System programmes were renamed University of London International Programmes. The central academic body of the university, collaborating with the colleges of the University of London, is renamed University of London International Academy, term mainly used internally.[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]
In parallel to this change, the teaching institutions are now categorized into Registered and Affiliate centers (collectively known as recognised centres). Students can either decide to study entirely by themselves, or to enjoy the administrative and academic support of the institutions that are recognised by the University of London for the International Programmes. Registered Centres have demonstrated commitment to developing high standards in respect of teaching, support to students and administrative processes. Affiliate Centres have demonstrated a sustained commitment to developing excellence in respect of  quality of teaching, support to students and administrative processes. Affiliate Centre status is the highest level of recognition awarded by the University of London. Recognition applies to specific programmes on named campuses.Information for students | University of London International Programmes. Londoninternational.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2013-07-17. New College of the Humanities, a private college founded in London in 2011, though not affiliated with the University of London, also plans to register its students for degrees through the programme.Rai, Binda.

==Influence==

The University of London external system has played an important role in the development of higher education institutions in Britain. Many leading research universities in England started out as "university colleges" that prepared students for external degrees of the University of London. Some technical colleges in England and Scotland also awarded University of London degrees and certificates prior to becoming polytechnics and then universities. Examples include the University of Nottingham, the University of Leicester and the University of Exeter in England, Cardiff University and Bangor University prior to joining the University of Wales and becoming independent and Robert Gordon University in Scotland.
This was a common way of establishing new universities in Britain and around the British Empire during the first half of the twentieth century. Many universities in the Commonwealth began as extension institutions or a provider of the programme. Notable examples include Ceylon University College in Ceylon, University College Ibadan (now the University of Ibadan) in Nigeria, the former University of East Africa's three constituent institutions and the University of the West Indies in the Caribbean.
