During their careers, the Lunts retreated to Ten Chimneys every summer for personal and artistic rejuvenation.  A host of stage and screen luminaries made pilgrimages to Genesee Depot as guests of the Lunts, including Noël Coward, Helen Hayes, Laurence Olivier, and Vivien Leigh. Carol Channing said, “If you get to go to Ten Chimneys, you must have done something right.”http://www.tenchimneys.org/tours/
Upon retirement, the Lunts returned to Ten Chimneys and spent the rest of their lives at their beloved home in Genesee Depot.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
The estate takes its name from the total of ten chimneys present on the grounds.http://www.tenchimneys.org/about-the-estate/ Buildings include a large main house, a cottage, a Swedish log cabin studio, an L-shaped pool, pool house, creamery, greenhouse, barns, stables, and other outbuildings. As a historic property the estate was exceptionally well preserved, since the Lunts' original furniture, decorations, and personal items were barely disturbed between Lynn Fontanne's death in 1983 and the beginning of preservation efforts by Ten Chimneys Foundation in 1998.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]

==Opening Ten Chimneys to the Public==

Arts advocate Joseph W. Garton, a restaurateur in Madison, Wisconsin, purchased Ten Chimneys.  In 1996, Ten Chimneys Foundation was established to preserve and share the impressive estate.  The Foundation then purchased the property from Mr. Garton in 1998.http://www.tenchimneys.org/foundation-history/
Ten Chimneys Foundation opened the estate to the public for the first time on May 26, 2003, which would have been the Lunts’ 81st wedding anniversary. The estate remains open for public tours from May through November.  Ten Chimneys Foundation also continues to fulfill the estate’s original role as a home for the arts by providing programming and resources for theater professionals.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
