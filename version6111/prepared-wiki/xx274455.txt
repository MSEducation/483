Pavlos Rakovitis was the nom de guerre of Pavlos Nikolaidis. Born in Rakovo, Florina, Ottoman Empire (modern-day Kratero, Florina, Greece) in 1877, he grew up to be the captain of 40 strong soldiers during the Macedonian Struggle. 
Pavlos grew up as a simple villager to a proud Greek Macedonian community and village.
At a very early stage in Rakovitis' life, he moved to the USA circa 1900 for work. During this time his village, Rakovo, was being burnt down by the Ottoman Turks in 1903.
Whilst over-seas, he learnt guerilla-like warfare skills and techniques, that he eventually employed when fighting against the Bulgarian comitadji's and Turks.
Once Pavlos returned to Rakovo, he rigorously led his soldiers against their enemies in order to maintain the true identity of Macedonia - the Hellenic one.
In 1907, Bulgarian bands entered his village and brutally destroyed it once again. Rakovitis was furious with the actions of the Bulgarians, especially since his own father was burnt to death in the family home. 
Eventually "Kapetan Pavlo" was executed by a former comrad named Mihail, who was bribed to assassinate him. 
Many people from the region of Florina know of Pavlos Rakovitis and his glorious story, in fact the Society Of Kratero Melbourne, Australia have him as their official logo, and are very proud to be associated with the defence of his people, village and Macedonia.
