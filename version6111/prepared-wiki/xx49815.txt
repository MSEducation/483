Aconcagua ([tpl]IPA-es|akoŋˈkaɣwa[/tpl]) is the highest mountain  in the Western and Southern Hemispheres at [tpl]convert|6960.8|m|ft[/tpl]. It is located in the Andes mountain range, in the province of Mendoza, Argentina, and lies 112 kilometres (70 mi) northwest of its capital, the city of Mendoza. The summit is also located about 5 kilometres from San Juan Province and 15 kilometres from the international border with Chile. Aconcagua is the highest peak in both the Western and Southern Hemispheres. It is one of the Seven Summits.
Aconcagua is bounded by the Valle de las Vacas to the north and east and the Valle de los Horcones Inferior to the West and South. The mountain and its surroundings are part of the Aconcagua Provincial Park. The mountain has a number of glaciers. The largest glacier is the Ventisquero Horcones Inferior at about 10 km long, which descends from the south face to about 3600 m altitude near the Confluencia camp.[ref]

Two other large glacier systems are the Ventisquero de las Vacas Sur and Glaciar Este/Ventisquero Relinchos system at about 5 km long.  The most well-known is the north-eastern or Polish Glacier, as it is a common route of ascent.
The mountain was created by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American plate during the geologically recent Andean orogeny; but it is not an active volcano.Simkin, T. and Siebert, L. (2002-). What is the world's highest volcano? Smithsonian Institution, Global Volcanism Program. Accessed 22 August 2012. The origin of the name is contested; it is either from the Arauca Aconca-Hue, which refers to the Aconcagua River and means "comes from the other side",[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] the Quechua Ackon Cahuak, meaning "'Sentinel of Stone",[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] or Quechua Anco Cahuac, "White Sentinel"Secor, op. cit., p. 13. or the Aymara Janq'u Q'awa, "White Ravine", "White Brook".Guías Pedagógicas del Sector Lengua Indígena, Aymara Ministerio de Educación, Fondo de las Naciones Unidas para la Infancia, UNICEF, Santiago de Chile, 2012 (Spanish), p. 62 Janq’u q’awa (Aconcagua: quebrada blanca).

==Climbing==

In mountaineering terms, Aconcagua is technically an easy mountain if approached from the north, via the normal route. Aconcagua is arguably the highest non-technical mountain in the world, since the northern route does not absolutely require ropes, axes, and pins.  Although the effects of altitude are severe (atmospheric pressure is 40% of sea-level at the summit), the use of supplemental oxygen is not required. Altitude sickness will affect most climbers to some extent, depending on the degree of acclimatization.[tpl]cite journal |author=Muza, SR; Fulco, CS; Cymerman, A |title=Altitude Acclimatization Guide |journal=US Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |issue=USARIEM–TN–04–05 |year=2004 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7616 |accessdate=2009-03-05 [/tpl] Even if the normal climb is technically easy, multiple casualties occur every year on this mountain (in January 2009 alone five climbers died). This is due to the large numbers of climbers who make the attempt and because many climbers underestimate the objective risks of the elevation and of cold weather, which is the real challenge on this mountain. Given the weather conditions close to the summit, cold weather injuries are very common. 
The Polish Glacier Traverse route, also known as the "Falso de los Polacos" route, crosses through the Vacas valley, ascends to the base of the Polish Glacier, then traverses across to the normal route for the final ascent to the summit. The third most popular route is by the Polish Glacier itself.
No hard records are kept about Aconcagua ascents, but the Provincial Park reports a success rate of about 60% of climbers who attempt the mountain. About 75% of climbers are foreigners and 25% are Argentinean. Among foreigners, the United States leads in number of climbers, followed by Germany and the UK. About 54% of climbers ascend the Normal Route, 43% up the Polish Glacier Route, and the remaining 3% on other routes.

The routes to the peak from the south and south-west ridges are more demanding, and the south face climb is considered very difficult.
The camp sites on the normal route are listed below (altitudes are approximate).
Summit attempts are usually made from a high camp at either Berlín or Colera, or from the lower camp at Nido de Cóndores. All camps are used frequently, namely Plaza de Mulas and Nido de Cóndores.

===History===

The first attempt to reach the summit of Aconcagua by a European was made in 1883 by a party led by the German geologist and explorer Paul Güssfeldt. Bribing porters with the story of treasure on the mountain, he approached the mountain via the Rio Volcan, making two attempts on the peak by the north-west ridge and reaching an altitude of [tpl]convert|6500|m|ft|-2[/tpl]. The route that he prospected is now the normal route up the mountain.
The first recorded ascent was in 1897 by a British expedition led by Edward FitzGerald. The summit was reached by the Swiss guide Matthias Zurbriggen on January 14 [tpl]cite journal|last=Fitzgerald|first=E. A.|year=1898|title=On Top of Aconcagua and Tupangato|journal=McClure's magazine|publisher=S. S. McClure, Limited|volume=12|issue=1|pages=71–78[/tpl] and by two other expedition members a few days later.
The youngest person to reach the summit of Aconcagua was Tyler Armstrong of California.  He was nine years old when he reached the summit on December 24, 2013.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-25531296|title=Nine-year-old US boy climbs Aconcagua peak in Argentina| work=BBC News|date=28 December 2013[/tpl] The oldest person to climb it was Scott Lewis, who reached the summit on November 26, 2007 when he was 87 years old.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edimpresa.diariouno.com.ar/2009/01/04/nota202048.html|title=Récord: un niño de 10 años hizo cumbre en el cerro Aconcagua|accessdate=2010-10-26|language=Spanish[/tpl]

==Popular culture==

The mountain has a cameo in a 1942 Disney cartoon called Pedro.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036256/|title=Pedro (1943)|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2010-10-26[/tpl] The cartoon stars an anthropomorphic small airplane named Pedro who makes an air mail run over the Andes and has a near-disastrous encounter with Aconcagua. The mountain was featured in an illustration used when the story was collected in a Disney anthology book.  It was also mentioned as the correct answer to a quiz show question in the 1969 Disney film, The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes.
