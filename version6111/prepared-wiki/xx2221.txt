[[Cerebrospinal fluid]]

CATEGORIES: Body fluids, Central nervous system, Neurology

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear colorless bodily fluid found in the brain and spine. It is produced in the choroid plexus of the brain. It acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain's cortex, providing a basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull, and it serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.
The CSF occupies the subarachnoid space (the space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater) and the ventricular system around and inside the brain and spinal cord. It constitutes the content of the ventricles, cisterns, and sulci of the brain, as well as the central canal of the spinal cord.

===Production===

The brain produces roughly 500 mL of cerebrospinal fluid per day. This fluid is constantly reabsorbed, so that only 100-160 mL is present at any one time. 
Ependymal cells of the choroid plexus produce more than two thirds of CSF. The choroid plexus is a venous plexus contained within the four ventricles of the brain, hollow structures inside the brain filled with CSF. The remainder of the CSF is produced by the surfaces of the ventricles and by the lining surrounding the subarachnoid space.[tpl]cite book|last=Hall|first=Arthur C.

Ependymal cells actively secrete sodium into the lateral ventricles. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF space. Chloride, with a negative charge, maintains electroneutrality and moves with the positively-charged sodium. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein.Saladin, Kenneth. Anatomy and Physiology, 6th edition.

===Circulation===

CSF circulates within the ventricular system of the brain. The majority of CSF is produced from within the lateral ventricles. From here, the CSF passes through the Interventricular foramina to the third ventricle, then the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle. The fourth ventricle is an outpouching on the posterior part of the brainstem. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes through the Foramen of Magendie (medial) and Foramen of Luschka (lateral) to enter the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain and spinal cord.[tpl]rp|764[/tpl]
The CSF moves in a pulsatile manner throughout the CSF system with nearly zero net flow. [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Reabsorption===

It had been thought that CSF returns to the vascular system by entering the dural venous sinuses via the arachnoid granulations (or villi). However, some[tpl]cite journal |author=Zakharov A, Papaiconomou C, Djenic J, Midha R, Johnston M |title=Lymphatic CSF absorption pathways in neonatal sheep revealed by sub arachnoid injection of Microfil |journal=Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=563–73 |year=2003 |pmid=14636163 |doi=10.1046/j.0305-1846.2003.00508.x[/tpl] have suggested that CSF flow along the cranial nerves and spinal nerve roots allow it into the lymphatic channels; this flow may play a substantial role in CSF reabsorbtion, in particular in the neonate, in which arachnoid granulations are sparsely distributed. The flow of CSF to the nasal submucosal lymphatic channels through the cribriform plate seems to be especially important.[tpl]cite journal |author=Johnston M |title=The importance of lymphatics in cerebrospinal fluid transport |journal=Lymphat. Res. Biol. |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=41–4 |year=2003 |pmid=15624320 |doi=10.1089/15396850360495682[/tpl]
CSF is reabsorbed into venous sinus blood via arachnoid granulations.

===Amount and constitution===

The CSF contains approximately 0.3% plasma proteins, or approximately 15 to 40 mg/dL, depending on sampling site,[tpl]cite journal |author=Felgenhauer K |title=Protein size and CSF composition |journal=Klin. Wochenschr. |volume=52 |issue=24 |pages=1158–64 |year=1974 |pmid=4456012 |doi=10.1007/BF01466734[/tpl] and it is produced at a rate of 500 ml/day. Since the subarachnoid space around the brain and spinal cord can contain only 135 to 150 ml, large amounts are drained primarily into the blood through arachnoid granulations in the superior sagittal sinus. Thus the CSF turns over about 3.7 times a day. This continuous flow into the venous system dilutes the concentration of larger, lipid-insoluble molecules penetrating the brain and CSF.[tpl]cite journal |author=Saunders NR, Habgood MD, Dziegielewska KM |title=Barrier mechanisms in the brain, I.
