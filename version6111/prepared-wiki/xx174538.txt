[[Chains (geological site)]]

CATEGORIES: Exmoor

The Chains is the name given to the north-west plateau of Exmoor, Somerset, England. This plateau lies above the [tpl]convert|1500|ft|m|0[/tpl] contour line, and includes the source of the River Barle.
It lies roughly within a triangle of land between Simonsbath, Challacombe and Lynton and has few distinguishing features. The highest point is at Chains Barrow - [tpl]convert|1599|ft|m|0[/tpl].
It is a Geological Conservation Review site,[tpl]cite web|title=The Chains (Quaternary of South-West England)|url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=4174&gcr=2020|publisher=Joint Nature Conservation Committee|accessdate=17 November 2013[/tpl] recognised as being nationally important for its south-western lowland heath communities and for transitions from ancient semi-natural woodland through upland heath to blanket mire. The Chains provides a palynological record of a mid to late Flandrian vegetation history on Exmoor. The pollen sequence in the peat is calibrated by radiocarbon dating.[tpl]cite web | title=North Exmoor | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1006541.pdf | accessdate=2006-08-19[/tpl] 
On the Chains above Simonsbath is a [tpl]convert|3|acre|ha[/tpl] reservoir known as Pinkery Pond. It was formed by John Knight and his son in the 19th century by damming the River Barle. The pond was originally intended to be [tpl]convert|7|acre|ha[/tpl]. Its purpose is unknown but close to the pond are the remains of a small canal.[tpl]cite book|last=Warren|first=Derrick|title=Curious Somerset|year=2005|publisher=Sutton Publishing|location=Stroud|isbn=978-0-7509-4057-3|pages=107â€“108[/tpl]
