The villains get great enjoyment showing off "old Superman" to the world...Superman then manages to figure out with help from the Justice League computer that blue kryptonite may reverse the aging process because blue kryptonite is harmful to backwards Bizarro and therefore should be helpful to Superman.  Superman finds the blue kryptonite and is aged back to normal and then goes on his quest to rescue the other Superfriends from the Phantom Zone and ultimately send the three villains back into the Phantom Zone.  This episode can be found on the DVD collection "Super Friends: Volume Two", which features 16 Super Friends cartoons from 1978. 
The Super Friends version of the Phantom Zone is described as, "Far beyond the boundaries of the Milky Way. In the uncharted void of deep space. An incredible 5th dimension of space and time, lies parallel to the universe that we know.
