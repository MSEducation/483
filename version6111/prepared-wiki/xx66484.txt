Vanity Fair is a magazine of popular culture, fashion, and current affairs published by Condé Nast. The present Vanity Fair has been published since 1983 and there have been editions for four European countries as well as the U.S. edition. This revived the title whose last title publication was February 1936 after a run from 1913. The current editor is Graydon Carter.

==Condé Nast's Vanity Fair==

Condé Montrose Nast began his empire by purchasing the men's fashion magazine Dress in 1913. He renamed the magazine Dress and Vanity Fair and published four issues in 1913.  It continued to thrive into the twenties. However, it became a casualty of the Great Depression and declining advertising revenues, although its circulation, at 90,000 copies, was at its peak. Condé Nast announced in December 1935 that Vanity Fair would be folded into Vogue (circulation 156,000) as of the March 1936 issue.[tpl]Citation |title=Vanity Fair Merged With Vogue by Nast |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 30, 1935 |page=21 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16F935551B728DDDA90B94DA415B858FF1D3 [/tpl].[tpl]Citation |title=Conde Nast Publications To Combine Two Magazines |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=December 31, 1935 |page=2 [/tpl].

==Modern revival==

Condé Nast Publications, under the ownership of S.I. Newhouse, announced in June 1981 that it was reviving the magazine.[tpl]Citation |title=Conde Nast to Revive Vanity Fair Magazine |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=July 1, 1981 |page=16 [/tpl]. The first issue was published in February 1983 (cover date March), edited by Richard Locke, formerly of The New York Times Book Review.[tpl]Citation |first=Sandra |last=Salmans |title=Courting the Elite at Condé Nast |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 6, 1983 |page=F1 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/06/business/courting-the-elite-at-conde-nast.html [/tpl]. After three issues, Locke was replaced by Leo Lerman, veteran features editor of Vogue.[tpl]Citation |first=Curt |last=Suplee |title=Vanity Fair Editor Fired |newspaper=Washington Post |date=April 27, 1983 |page=B4 [/tpl]. He was followed by editors Tina Brown (1984–1992) and Graydon Carter (since 1992). Regular columnists have included Sebastian Junger, Michael Wolff, Maureen Orth and Christopher Hitchens. Famous contributing photographers for the magazine include Bruce Weber, Annie Leibovitz, Mario Testino and Herb Ritts, who have all provided the magazine with a string of lavish covers and full-page portraits of current celebrities. Amongst the most famous of these was the August 1991 Leibovitz cover featuring a naked, pregnant Demi Moore, an image entitled More Demi Moore that to this day holds a spot in pop culture.
In addition to its controversial photography, the magazine also prints articles on a variety of topics. In 1996, journalist Marie Brenner wrote an exposé on the tobacco industry titled "The Man Who Knew Too Much". The article was later adapted into a movie The Insider (1999), which starred Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Most famously, after more than thirty years of mystery, an article in the May 2005 edition revealed the identity of Deep Throat (W. Mark Felt), one of the sources for The Washington Post articles on Watergate, which led to the 1974 resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon. The magazine also features candid interviews with celebrities, including a monthly Proust Questionnaire. Other notable interviews have included: Teri Hatcher, who revealed in the magazine that she was sexually abused as a child; Jennifer Aniston's first interview after her divorce from Brad Pitt; Anderson Cooper, who talked about his brother's death; and Martha Stewart's first interview after her release from prison.
In August 2006, Vanity Fair sent photographer Annie Leibovitz to the Telluride, Colorado, home of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes for its October 2006 issue. The photo shoot was of the couple and their daughter, Suri Cruise, who had previously been "hidden", without pictures released to the public, causing many to start to deny her existence. This issue became the second highest selling issue for the magazine; the first was the Jennifer Aniston cover after her divorce. In December 2006, Vanity Fair featured the video portrait of Brad Pitt by director Robert Wilson on the cover of its first arts issue, marking the mainstream actor's growing commitment to fine art.
The magazine was the subject of Toby Young's book, How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, about his search for success, from 1995, in New York working for Graydon Carter's Vanity Fair. The book has been made into a movie, with Jeff Bridges playing Carter.

==Controversies==

===Controversial pictorials===

Some of the pictorials in Vanity Fair have attracted criticism. The April 1999 issue featured an image of actor Mike Myers dressed as a Hindu deity for a photo spread by David LaChapelle: after criticism, both the photographer and the magazine apologized.SAJA Vanity Fair article, June 9, 2000[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]
On April 25, 2008, the televised entertainment program Entertainment Tonight reported that 15-year-old Miley Cyrus had posed topless for a photo shoot with Vanity Fair.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23608789-5001026,00.html|title=Miley Cyrus topless controversy|date=April 28, 2008|accessdate=April 27, 2008|publisher=news.com.au/dailytelegraph/[/tpl] The photo, and subsequently released behind-the-scenes photos, show Cyrus without a top, her bare back exposed but her front covered with a bedsheet. The photo shoot was taken by photographer Annie Leibovitz.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20195785,00.html|title=Miley Cyrus: I'm Sorry for Photos|author=Stephen M. Silverman|date=April 27, 2008|accessdate=April 27, 2008|publisher=people.com[/tpl] The full photograph was published with an accompanying story on The New York Times' website on April 27, 2008. On April 29, 2008, The New York Times clarified that though the pictures left an impression that she was bare-breasted, Cyrus was wrapped in a bedsheet and was actually not topless.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/business/media/28hannah.html|title=A Topless Photo Threatens a Major Disney Franchise|author=Brook Barnes|date=April 28, 2008|accessdate=April 29, 2008|publisher=nytimes.com[/tpl] Some parents expressed outrage at the nature of the photograph, which a Disney spokesperson described as "a situation that was created to deliberately manipulate a 15-year-old to sell magazines." In response to the internet circulation of the photo and ensuing media attention, Miley Cyrus released a statement of apology on April 27: "I took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be 'artistic' and now, seeing the photographs and reading the story, I feel so embarrassed. I never intended for any of this to happen and I apologize to my fans who I care so deeply about."

===Polanski libel case===

In 2005, Vanity Fair was found liable in a lawsuit brought in the UK by film director Roman Polanski, who claimed the magazine had libelled him in an article published in 2002, and written by A. E. Hotchner.  The article recounted a claim by Lewis H. Lapham, editor of Harper's, that Polanski had made sexual advances towards a young model as he was travelling to the funeral of his wife, Sharon Tate, in August 1969, claiming that he could make her "the next Sharon Tate". The court permitted Polanski to testify via a video link, after he expressed fears that he might be extradited were he to enter the United Kingdom.Polanski takes appeal to Lords BBC News (online), November 17, 2004 The trial started on July 18, 2005, and Polanski made English legal history as the first claimant to give evidence by video link. During the trial, which included the testimonies of Mia Farrow and others, it was proved that the alleged scene at the famous New York restaurant Elaine's could not possibly have taken place on the date given, because Polanski only dined at this restaurant three weeks later. Also, the Norwegian then-model disputed the accounts that he had claimed to be able to make her "the next Sharon Tate".
Polanski was awarded £50,000 damages by the High Court in London. The case was notable because Polanski was living in France as a fugitive from U.S. justice, and never appeared in the London court for fear he would be extradited to the U.S.  Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair, responded, "I find it amazing that a man who lives in France can sue a magazine that is published in America in a British courtroom."How I spent my summer vacation in London being sued by Roman Polanski – and what I learned about "solicitors," pub food, and the British chattering class, by Graydon Carter, Vanity Fair, September 19, 2005

===Lindsay Lohan interview===

In January 2006, Vanity Fair published a cover feature and an interview with Lindsay Lohan in which she admitted using drugs "a little", although she denied ever using cocaine, describing it as a "sore subject".  The article said she had recovered from "bulimic episodes", and that her 2005 hospitalization was for "a swollen liver and kidney infection".[tpl]cite web | title=news.yahoo.com | work=Reuters: Lindsay Lohan Admits Drug Use, Bulimia Battle | url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060104/people_nm/lohan_dc_3 | accessdate=January 4, 2006[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Lohan later said she was "appalled" that her words were "misused and misconstrued" for the article; the magazine however replied that "Every word recorded on tape.
