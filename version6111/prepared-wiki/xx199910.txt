The Pulsars was a new wave/indie rock band from Chicago, Illinois led by Dave Trumfio and his brother, Harry Trumfio.  They signed to Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss's Almo Sounds label and recorded two albums in the mid-1990s, one of which was released and another that has yet to be released.

==History==

The band comprised the brothers Dave and Harry Trumfio, with Harry on drums and Dave producing, singing and playing all of the other instruments.Molanphy, Chris (1997) "Pulsars / Pulsars", CMJ New Music Monthly, May 1997, p.12 The brothers had played together in bands since they were at school, and recorded at home. Trumfio named his synthesizers and electronic gear 'Theodore 9000', which he described as "the third member of our band", and the brothers considered 'T9000' as the name of the band before deciding on The Pulsars.Strauss, Neil (1997) "Nerdy White Boys", SPIN, May 1997, p. 28-9, retrieved 2012-01-08 Dave Trumfio had previously played in Ashtray Boy and The Mekons.Anderson, Lydia (1996) "The Pulsars", CMJ New Music Monthly, November 1996, retrieved 2012-01-08

The band's self-titled debut album was released on Almo Sounds in 1997, and was described as "an album that's in the moment, behind the times, and looking to the future", with influences from the early 1980s, although writer Ritchie Unterberger viewed the band's sound as "considerably more enjoyable and warm" than their 1970s and 1980s influences, describing the album as "pleasant, catchy retro-new wave". SPIN[tpl]'[/tpl]s Eric Weisbard described the album's songs as "amazingly confident, catchy anthems".Weisbard, Eric (1997) "Pulsars Pulsars", SPIN, April 1997, p.155-6, retrieved 2012-01-08 In the view of Trouser Press writer Ira Robbins:

Several of the band's lyrics dealt with futuristic topics such as robots, spaceships, and aliens. The debut album included "Tunnels", which was described as "a romantic ballad about the great highway tunnels of America", and "My Pet Robot", a love song to Theodore 9000. The band's sound has been described as "a schizoid patchwork of synth-pop, new wave and R&B". The band was compared with the Pixies by Allmusic writer Nitsuh Abebe,Abebe, Nitsuh "Submission to the Masters Review", Allmusic, retrieved 2012-01-08 also being compared the The Cars and The Cure.Gundersen, Edna (1997) "Pulsars' spaced-out debut; Fleming's expansive Schubert", USA Today, April 15, 1997, P. 4D (LIFE section) The band's live shows included dub interludes.Meyer, Bill (1995) "Pulsars", Chicago Reader, retrieved 2012-01-08
The band was described as "Chicago's pre-eminent new wave revival band" by the Chicago Reader,Unterberger, Ritchie (1999) Music USA: The Rough Guide, Rough Guides, ISBN 978-1-85828-421-7, p. 272-3 and "profoundly great" by Trouser Press.
The band split up before their second album was completed, with Dave Trumfio become increasingly busy with production work, but reunited for a one-off performance in 2009 at the Bell House in Brooklyn.Pearis, Bill (2009) "Pulsars reuniting for one Brooklyn show w/ Field Music, Wye Oak & "Rumours" (++ other tour dates & stuff)", brooklynvegan.com, November 13, 2009, retrieved 2012-01-08 The brothers reportedly had plans to complete the second Pulsars album, and were working again under the name Our Future.
