CATEGORIES: Japanese kitchen knives

Yanagi-ba-bōchō (柳刃包丁, lit. willow blade knife), Yanagi-ba or shortly Yanagi is a long and very thin knife used in the Japanese kitchen, belonging to the group of Sashimi hōchō (Japanese: 刺身包丁, Sashimi fish hōchō knife) to prepare sashimi, sushi, sliced raw fish and seafood.
In preparing sashimi and sushi, there are very important conditions that the sliced cross section be smooth, shiny and sharp in a microscopic view. Those conditions cannot be met by other usual knives. Yanabi-ba-bocho is especially designed to satisfy the conditions.  Important design points for it are as follows:
The first two characteristics are particularly for yanagi-ba-bocho, and its name 'yanagi' is from long and pliant characteristics of a willow branch.  The other characteristics are shared by all knives in Japanese cuisine.
The important principle in using a yanagi-ba to prepare sashimi is not cutting down but pulling with its long blade in a single motion.
