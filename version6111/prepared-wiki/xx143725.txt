Njala University (NU) is a public university located in Bo and in Njala, Moyamba District, Sierra Leone. It is the second largest university in Sierra Leone (after the Fourah Bay College) and is also part of the University of Sierra Leone. The largest and main campus of Njala University is in Bo, the second largest city in Sierra Leone; the other campus is in the town of Njala, Moyamba District. 

==History==

NU was originally created as part of the University of Sierra Leone (USL) in 1964 with the help of USAID and offered degrees in conjunction with the University of Illinois. Subsequent legislation in 1972 paired Fourah Bay and Njala under the University of Sierra Leone act, where the presidents of each institution switched the presidency of the USL on a biennial basis. This continued until 2005, when the University act separated Fourah Bay and NU into distinct institutions independently run.

As of the 1999-2000 academic year, NU had 722 male students and 98 female, which equated to approximately 27% of Sierra Leonean college students. It had 436 male staff and 98 females.

==Bo campus==
