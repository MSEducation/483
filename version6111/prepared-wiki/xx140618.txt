At the news department of KOGO in San Diego, Gilliland used the pseudonyms of John Land and Johnny Land.
In 1965, Gilliland came to the news department of KRLA radio in Los Angeles County, where he became one of the original members of The Credibility Gap which mixed topical humor along with their news broadcasts.  Fellow founding member Richard Beebe said of him that  Even though John was an integral part of the "Gap," working on the Pop Chronicles was always number one for him. It seemed like he was always working on it. John was a very talented guy and a lot of fun.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.laradio.com/july98.htm |title=~Los Angeles Radio People, Archives |publisher=Laradio.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-03[/tpl]   Gilliland researched this radio documentary, The Pop Chronicles, for over two years prior to its broadcast.[ref]
