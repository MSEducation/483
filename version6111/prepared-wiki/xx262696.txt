CATEGORIES: State highway loops in Texas

Loop 163 is a state highway loop located in Blanco County, Texas.

==Route description==

The southern terminus of Loop 163 is at a junction with US 281, just inside the Blanco city limits. The route runs to the north, essentially parallel to the current alignment of US 281. It has an intersection with RM 165 before crossing the Blanco River. Access to the north bank of the river and Blanco State Park is provided by Park Road 23. Loop 163 turns to the west and ends at an intersection with US 281 in downtown Blanco; the road continues to the northwest as RM 1623.[tpl]Texas Mapbook|402|2011-01-05[/tpl]
Because Loop 163 provides a connection between RM 165 and US 281, signage from US 281 at both ends of Loop 163 also contains the RM 165 route marker.

==History==

Loop 163 was designated in 1960. The route is a former alignment of US 281 through Blanco.
A previous route designated Spur 163 existed in Houston from 1945 to 1954. This designation was canceled when US 59 was rerouted over the alignment.
