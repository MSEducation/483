Temple Works is a former flax mill in Holbeck, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.

Hick and Sons). Temple Works is the only Grade I listed building in Holbeck.
Temple Works, also known as Temple Mill, comprises an office block and factory, the office block based on the temple at Antaeopolis and Temple of Horus at Edfu with a chimney designed in the style of an obelisk; the factory building derived from the Typhonium at Dendera. Hick's engine was modelled with Egyptian details including a regulator in the form of a winged solar disk.[tpl]cite book|last=Stevens Curl|first=James|title=The Egyptian Revival|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134234686|page=279|pages=|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OcU7YPeE5yoC&pg=PA279&lpg=PA279&dq=benjamin+hick+temple+mill&source=bl&ots=1ybqvueJzp&sig=N0y1QbULIXrRhuJqi-ETxpIW590&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NHrOUv-fDYHK4ASvkYGgAg&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=benjamin%20hick%20temple%20mill&f=false[/tpl]
Marshall's inspiration for the design of Temple Works was his interest in Egyptology. When it was built it was said that Temple Works was the biggest single room in the world. An unusual feature of the Temple Works building is that sheep used to graze on the grass-covered roof. This served the purpose of retaining humidity in the flax mill to prevent the linen thread from becoming dried out and unmanageable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.victoriansociety.org.uk/news/temple-mill-leeds/|title=Temple Mill, Leeds|publisher=The Victorian Society|accessdate=27 October 2012[/tpl]
The mill was caught up in the Plug Riots of August 1842.  The Leeds Annals Mayhall, The Annals and History of Leeds and other places in the County of York, Leeds 1860, page 484 described the events at the mill:
“The vicinity of the new mill in Marshall Street was completely crammed with an excited mob, many of whom were armed with bludgeons, stones &c.  The yard-door leading to the boilers of the new mill was strongly defended by Mr J. G. Marshall, and a number of workmen; but the mob by repeated efforts forced down the door, and rushed into the yard.  They could not find the plug of the boiler, and consequently did not succeed in stopping the mill.  They left the premises without having done any serious mischief, and then proceeded to the mill of Messrs. Titley, Tatham and Walker, Water Lane, which they were engaged in stopping when Prince George with the Lancers came up at full speed and formed in a line in Camp Field.  The riot act was read, and two or three of the ringleaders were taken prisoners … .”
A planning application dated July 2005 proposed to partly demolish, refurbish, and extend the mill to form a retail centre, offices, cafes, 75 flats and parking. On 8 December 2008 a stone pillar in the mill's facade collapsed. A slab of millstone grit fell onto the pavement in Marshall Street and the roof parapet above the pillar bowed out.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/7771987.stm|title=Pillar collapses at historic mill |date=8 December 2008|work=BBC News|accessdate=11 December 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/Historic-Leeds-building-collapses.4770420.jp|title=Historic Leeds building collapses|last=Smith|first=Bruce|date=8 December 2008|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|accessdate=11 December 2008|format= with video[/tpl] English Heritage advised on a strategy for repairs; their spokesman said that the building was "probably the finest example of a carved stone elevation in the whole region."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/39Egyptian-temple39-in-Leeds-shored.4777389.jp|title='Egyptian temple' in Leeds shored up as owners take advice|date=10 December 2008|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|last=Marsh | first=David|accessdate=11 December 2008[/tpl]
In late 2009 the building was opened as an arts centre, with an initial exhibition and tour as part of Leeds Light Night on 9 October.
