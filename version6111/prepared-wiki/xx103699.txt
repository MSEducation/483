Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) is a mutagenic, teratogenic, and possibly carcinogenic organic compound with formula CH3SO3C2H5.  It produces random mutations in genetic material by nucleotide substitution; particularly by guanine alkylation.  This typically produces only point mutations.  It can induce mutations at a rate of 5x10-4 to 5x10-2 per gene without substantial killing.  The ethyl group of EMS reacts with guanine in DNA, forming the abnormal base O-6-ethylguanine. During DNA replication, DNA polymerases that catalyze the process frequently place thymine, instead of cytosine, opposite O-6-ethylguanine. Following subsequent rounds of replication, the original G:C base pair can become an A:T pair (a transition mutation). This changes the genetic information, is often harmful to cells, and can result in disease.
EMS is often used in genetics as a mutagen. Mutations induced by EMS can then be studied in genetic screens or other assays.
