==History==

The American Automobile Association (the "AAA" or "Triple-A") was founded on March 4, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois when, in response to a lack of roads and highways suitable for automobiles,[tpl]cite web |title=AAA to Celebrate 100 Years With Special Offerings to Members |url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2002/01/14/034524.html |publisher=TheAutoChannel.com |accessdate=2010-09-10[/tpl] nine motor clubs with a total of 1,500 members banded together to form the Triple-A.  Those individual motor clubs included the Chicago Automobile Club, Automobile Club of America, Automobile Club of New Jersey, and others.[tpl]cite web |title=American Automobile Association |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3401800150.html |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2010-09-10| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101017044020/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3401800150.html| archivedate= 17 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In 1904, the AAA merged with the American Motor League, the first American automobile organization.Motor age (magazine), Volume 5, 1904, page 109.
The first AAA road maps were published in 1905; AAA began printing hotel guides in 1917. Triple-A began its School Safety Patrol Program in 1920, the first of the association's driver safety programs, providing local schools with materials (including badges and ID cards[tpl]cite web |title=What I Sniped A Few Days Back!  |date=January 9, 2010 |url=http://jonwestfall.com/2010/01/what-i-sniped-a-few-days-back/[/tpl]) to train and organize students into a patrol force. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, which conducts studies on motorist safety, was established as a separate entity in 1947.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
AAA created an organization called the Racing Board, and later known as the Contest Board, in 1902 to officiate the Vanderbilt Cup  international automobile race in Long Island, New York. The Racing Board sanctioned the Indianapolis 500 and awarded national racing championships in 1905, 1916, 1920–1941, and 1946–1955.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.champcarstats.com/Year.htm|title=Through the Years|publisher=ChampCarStats.com|accessdate=2010-10-07[/tpl] After the 1955 Le Mans disaster, AAA decided that auto racing distracted from its primary goals, and the United States Automobile Club was formed to take over the race sanctioning/officiating. In 2005, AAA re-entered racing as a sponsor of ISC-owned tracks. In 2006, AAA's foray into racing expanded when it made a three-year commitment to sponsor Roush Racing's number 6 car on the NASCAR Nextel Circuit.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
In 1935, AAA published Sportsmanlike Driving, the first course outline for high school teachers. In 1936, AAA published the first driver education curriculum for use in high schools (also titled Sportsmanlike Driving, now known as Responsible Driving).[tpl]cite web |title=Sportsmanlike driving, a program for high schools |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001619963 |publisher=AAA |accessdate=2010-09-13[/tpl]  AAA has updated its driver training courses throughout the years and many clubs currently offer their own driving schools, or work with other companies to provide AAA’s driving curriculum.[tpl]cite web |title=The Driving School Association of the Americas |url=http://www.thedsaa.org/partnership.asp |year=1986 |accessdate=2010-09-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100927060119/http://www.thedsaa.org/partnership.asp| archivedate= 27 September 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Knowing that vehicles pose a hazard to pedestrians, in 1936 AAA began a pedestrian safety program with a grant from the Automotive Safety Foundation. AAA went on to commission and publish (1938) an extensive study of pedestrian safety for the purpose of reducing pedestrian fatalities and injuries. AAA’s Pedestrian Protection Program began in 1937 and focuses national attention on pedestrian safety needs by recognizing cities, counties and states that have demonstrated successful pedestrian safety programs.[tpl]cite news|title=Five Communities Cited For Pedestrian Safety |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1986-08-08/news/2539361_1_pedestrian-protection-program-pedestrian-fatalities-citation |publisher=The Morning Call |accessdate=2010-09-13[/tpl]
The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety was established as a separate entity in 1947, and continues to conduct research related to traffic and pedestrian safety.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
AAA has also provided services to the U.S. government in times of war. During the 1940s, AAA offered its services to the Advisory Commission of the Council of National Defense[tpl]cite web|title=Council of National Defense |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/council-of-national-defense |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=2010-09-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100831023733/http://www.answers.com/topic/council-of-national-defense| archivedate= 31 August 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] in anticipation of becoming involved in World War II. AAA President Thomas P. Henry was appointed consultant in the transportation unit of the Defense Council, and AAA pledged resources, including highway information, to national defense planning efforts as it had during World War I.[tpl]cite journal |title=Motorists do their 'bit' |url=http://books.google.com/?id=PqYAAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA17&lpg=RA2-PA17&dq=%22Advisory+Commission+of+the+Council+of+National+Defense+%22+AND+%22American+Automobile+Association%22#v=onepage&q=%22Advisory%20Commission%20of%20the%20Council%20of%20National%20Defense%20%22%20AND%20%22American%20Automobile%20Association%22&f=false |publisher=Motor West |year=1917 |accessdate=2010-09-13[/tpl]
Reductions in manufacturing because of the war increased the need for conservation in automobiles and their related products. AAA's efforts at conservation included supporting the manufacture of synthetic rubber in anticipation of a war-related tire/rubber shortage, urging motorists to reduce their driving speed to conserve fuel (1942); and backing a scrap rubber campaign (1942). In 1944, AAA’s Keep 'em Rolling campaign sponsored a cross-country tour featuring cars equipped with synthetic tires. The tour demonstrated the reliability of tires made with synthetic rubber.[tpl]cite journal |title=AAA Tour Cars |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/fullRecord.asp?id=39718&qstring=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wisconsinhistory.org%2Fwhi%2Fresults.asp%3Fsubject_narrow%3DSafety%2Beducation |publisher=Wisconsin History Society |accessdate=2010-09-13[/tpl] In doing its part to assist in the war effort, AAA placed its mapping facilities at the disposal of the Army department; conducted motor pool driver education (1943); secured an order from the War Production Board that stopped the sale of certain anti-freeze solutions harmful to motors (1943); launched a campaign to alleviate a growing shortage of auto mechanics (1943); monitored tire and gasoline rationing (1943); and established, in cooperation with the Red Cross and military hospitals, a driver training program for veterans with artificial limbs (1944). AAA also assisted in the development of a manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and their operation during wartime (1942).[tpl]cite journal|title=War Emergency Edition: Manual on Uniform Traffic Devices for Streets and Highways |url=https://ceprofs.civil.tamu.edu/ghawkins/MUTCD-History_files/1942%20MUTCD.pdf |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |year=1942 |accessdate=2010-09-13[/tpl]
The end of the war brought new needs for motorists and AAA assisted by releasing the film "Traffic Jam Ahead", which outlined a practical program for postwar traffic safety, and publishing Post-war Travel Trends as a public service. In 1946, AAA launched a campaign called "Take It Easy", which was designed to reduce traffic fatalities. Subsequently, fatalities dropped 20 percent below the pre-war figure.[tpl]cite journal |first=Richard F. |last=Weingroff |title=PRESIDENT WIGHT D EISENHOWER AND THE FEDERAL ROLE IN HIGHWAY SAFETY |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/safety.pdf |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |accessdate=2010-09-13[/tpl]
In the 1960s, AAA helped draft the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, setting safety standards for automobiles, tires, and equipment. AAA also helped draft the Highway Safety Act, specifying standards for motor vehicle inspection and registration, motorcycle safety, driver education, driver licensing, traffic courts, highway design, construction, maintenance, and traffic control devices.[tpl]cite journal |title=Federal motor vehicle safety standards and regulations, with amendments and interpretations |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/federalmotorvehi489unit/federalmotorvehi489unit_djvu.txt |accessdate=2010-09-17[/tpl]
During the oil crisis of the 1970s, the AAA Fuel Gauge Report was created to assist motorists in finding gas stations that had fuel and were open. AAA also began its Gas Watchers program with the endorsement of President Gerald Ford. The Gas Watchers Guide continues to be published to provide simple steps motorists can take to conserve gasoline in their daily driving.[tpl]cite journal |first=Yanek |last=Mieczkowski |title=Gerald Ford and the challenges of the 1970s |url=http://books.google.com/?id=m2JyHO1vNOEC&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=%22American+Automobile+Association%22+AND+%22gerald+ford%22#v=onepage&q=%22American%20Automobile%20Association%22%20AND%20%22gerald%20ford%22&f=false |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8131-2349-3 |accessdate=2010-09-17[/tpl]
In 1979, President Jimmy Carter appointed AAA President James B. Creal to the National Alcohol Fuels Commission. Creal also chaired a task force on gas rationing and was appointed to President Carter’s National Council on Energy Efficiency. AAA representatives serving on President Carter's Alcohol Fuels Commission were requested to sign the Energy Securities Act of 1980. In addition, Creal served on the Industries Advisory Board of Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus in the early 1980s.[tpl]cite news |first=Suzy |last=Hagstrom |title=Aaa Leader A Strong, Silent Type |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-02-19/business/9002173602_1_creal-aaa-membership |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |date=February 19, 1990 |accessdate=2010-09-17[/tpl]
In the 1980s, AAA's mapping services received significant recognition when scenic highways were identified on AAA's sheet maps for the first time. AAA maps were used in the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition where more than 13,000 full-color AAA map images were provided on an optical laser disc for demonstration of an in-car navigation device in the Chrysler Pavilion. And in 1985 the AAA North American Road Atlas was sold at retail for the first time and made the New York Times best-seller paperback list within six weeks. AAA experimented in the 1980s with the On-line Touring Information System (OTIS), which eventually was combined with other automated services under the name AAA Travel Match. The self-service terminal worked like an ATM, with rotating menus and touch-control screens that allowed users to obtain local travel information.[tpl]cite web |first=Anne |last=Lenaghan |title=American Automobile Association selects Informix as database of choice; INFORMIX-OnLine Dynamic Server to run universal AAAccess system  |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/American+Automobile+Association+selects+Informix+as+database+of...-a015882376 |accessdate=2010-09-17[/tpl]

AAA joined government and private-sector companies—the Federal Highway Administration, Avis, General Motors and the Florida Department of Transportation—in 1990 for the Smart Car experiment, also known as the TravTek Project. This test of a computerized in-car navigation and travel information system demonstrated consumer acceptance of telematics technology that would make driving easier and reduce traffic congestion.[tpl]cite press release |title=TravTek Project Receives ITE Transportation Achievement Award |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TRAVTEK+PROJECT+RECEIVES+ITE+TRANSPORTATION+ACHIEVEMENT+AWARD-a012443816 |date=August 10, 1992 |accessdate=2010-09-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Vehicle Navigation and Information Systems Conference, 1991 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=1623685 |date=October 20, 1991|accessdate=2010-09-17[/tpl]
A new driver's education program, "Teaching Teens to Drive", was introduced by AAA in 1996 to focus on parent involvement in teen driving education. A year later, in 1997, AAA launched Licensed to Learn, a campaign to increase awareness of the need for Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) laws in every state. At the outset of the campaign only eight states had enacted GDL laws. Today, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of GDL legislation.[tpl]cite press release |title=AAA to Celebrate 100 Years With Public Service Campaign, Special Offerings to Members |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/AAA+to+Celebrate+100+Years+With+Public+Service+Campaign%2c+Special...-a081773495 |publisher=Business Wire|date=January 14, 2002 |accessdate=2010-09-17[/tpl]
Research in the 1990s led AAA to pursue another issue of importance to US motorists: a transportation crisis resulting from infrastructure that had been under-funded for many years. The Crisis Ahead: America's Aging Highways and Airways research led to AAA helping to shape two pieces of landmark legislation: the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) in 1998 and the Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR-21) in 2000.[tpl]cite web |title=AAA President/CEO Issues Four Point Plan To Improve the Air Travel System |url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2000/08/21/006300.html |publisher=TheAutoChannel.com |accessdate=2010-09-17[/tpl] Both laws embrace the principle that user fees charged to motorists and air travelers should be fully invested in improving and modernizing the nation's surface and air transportation infrastructures.[tpl]cite press release |title=AAA TO DEMOCRATS: PRESERVE AMERICA'S HIGHWAYS AND AIRWAYS |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/AAA+TO+DEMOCRATS%3a+PRESERVE+AMERICA%27S+HIGHWAYS+AND+AIRWAYS-a018468531 |publisher=PRNewswire |date=July 10, 1996 |accessdate=2010-09-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=AAA Statement: Feds Need to Boost Highway Safety Effort |url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/date/19970131/news03086.html |publisher=TheAutoChannel.com |date=January 31, 1997 |accessdate=2010-09-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web |first=James L. |last=Kolstad |title=ISTEA to The Rescue |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/Quality/LTAP/Newsletters/summer1%5B1%5D.htm |publisher=Ohio LTAP Center |accessdate=2010-09-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100803204339/http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/Quality/LTAP/Newsletters/summer1%5B1%5D.htm| archivedate= 3 August 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Because of its work in traffic safety AAA was cited in 1998 as the Clinton administration's number one traffic safety partner by U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater.

==Current operations==

Members belong to one of 69 individual clubs (see List of AAA regional clubs), and the clubs in turn own AAA. The number of local clubs has decreased over time through consolidation; as late as the 1970s the membership roster included dozens of clubs that each served a single county, particularly in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The member clubs have arranged a reciprocal service system so that members of any participating club are able to receive member services from any other affiliate club. Member dues finance all club services as well as the operations of the national organization.
The vast majority of AAA clubs have "AAA" as part of their name, although the two largest AAA clubs by membership do not: the Automobile Club of Southern California and Auto Club South.
From the standpoint of the consumer, AAA clubs primarily provide emergency road services to members. These services, which include towing, lockouts, winching, tire changes, automotive first aid, and others, are handled by private local towing companies contracted by a state AAA club. AAA sells roadside assistance for a variety of motor vehicles, including motorcycles. In some areas, AAA also offers bicycle roadside assistance. Many AAA clubs have an automotive fleet division serving large metro areas, while private towing companies cover the surplus call volume by area. Recently, certain clubs have implemented an "on the go" diagnostic/installation automotive battery program.[tpl]cite journal |first=Drew|last=Hardin |title=Top 10 Other Benefits of Your AAA Membership |url=http://www.edmunds.com/reviews/list/top10/131932/article.html |publisher=edmunds.com |accessdate=2010-09-03 |quote=For 11 years now, AAA's been offering mobile battery service. That's not just about giving your battery juice via jumper cables as part of the roadside-assistance package. AAA will test, diagnose or even replace the battery on the spot to help prevent you from ending up on the roadside in the future.[/tpl]
Clubs also distribute road maps (including customized map guides for specific journeys, branded as "TripTik") and travel publications (TourBooks), and rate restaurants and hotels according to a "diamond" scale (one to five). The best hotels and restaurants according to AAA's criteria receive the Five Diamond Award. Many offices sell automobile liability insurance, provide travel agency, auto-registration and notary services.  Maps, TourBooks, and travel agent services are generally free to members. AAA also offers member discounts through its "Show Your Card & Save" program.[tpl]cite web |title=AAA.com/discounts |url=http://www.aaa.com/discounts |publisher=AAA |accessdate=2010-09-03| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100901052828/http://www.aaa.com/discounts| archivedate= 1 September 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
AAA is authorized by the U.S. Department of State to issue International Driving Permits in the United States, along with the National Automobile Club.

==International affiliates==

The AAA has reciprocal arrangements with a range of international affiliates. In general, members of affiliates are offered the same benefits as members of the AAA while traveling in the United States, while AAA members are offered equivalent benefits while traveling in the territory of the affiliate.
International affiliates include:
An updated listing of International Affiliates can be found on AAA's Exchange website.

==AAA and motorist rights==

The AAA has a mixed record supporting motorist rights.
The AAA is known for occasional high profile motorist advisories of traffic enforcement, such as when it rented a billboard to warn motorists of the speed trap town of Lawtey, Florida.[tpl]cite news |first=Kyle |last=Meenan |title=Billboard Wars Over Lawtey As A 'Speed Trap' |url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/news-article.aspx?storyid=32199 |publisher=First Coast News |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-09-16[/tpl] It also is a supporter of the Motor Vehicle Owners' Right to Repair Act, first introduced in 2001 but which has not become law.
However, the AAA supported measures that curtail motorist freedoms or tax motorists, such as:

==AAA and the environment==

See “History” above for AAA’s involvement in conservation during World War II and the oil crisis of the 1970s.
In 2001, AAA launched its Great Battery Roundup to encourage motorists to recycle old automobile batteries, tires and various types of automotive fluids. Since then more than 4 million batteries have been recycled through that program and the mobile battery service. Typically held around Earth Day, AAA clubs often team up with other environmental organization such as the EPA and the Nature Conservancy to expand these recycling efforts.[tpl]cite web |title=This Earth Day, AAA, The EPA and The Nature Conservancy Sponsored The Great Battery RoundUp |url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/newjersey/press/press1864.html |publisher=The Nature Conservancy |accessdate=2010-09-29[/tpl]
In 2006, AAA worked with the EPA to improve the fuel economy information provided to new car buyers by vehicle manufacturers. Using several different types of tests AAA recreated real-world driving conditions to illustrate the difference in fuel economy, and the EPA incorporated AAA’s testing into their new procedures. The more accurate testing resulted in a reduction of miles per gallon claims from 5 to 25 percent, beginning with 2008 model year vehicles.[tpl]cite web |title=New EPA Fuel Economy Ratings |url=http://www.gassavers.org/showthread.php?t=2209 |publisher=GasSavers.org |date=November 17, 2006 |accessdate=2010-09-29[/tpl]
As fuel prices rise, consumers often see increased marketing of fuel additives as a way to boost fuel economy. AAA has tested many of these products and has never found one that provides significant savings for consumers. AAA has warned consumers repeatedly against products that make such claims and encourages motorists to instead develop fuel-conserving driving habits such as reducing the weight of the vehicle by removing unnecessary objects from the trunk, smooth stops and starts, and reducing their speed.[tpl]cite web |title=AAA: Steer Clear of "Fuel-Saving" Additives |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2006/05/aaa_steer_clear.html |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=May 26, 2006 |accessdate=2010-09-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101021082115/http://www.greencarcongress.com/2006/05/aaa_steer_clear.html| archivedate= 21 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
It is generally understood that the benefits of fuel conservation for consumers include financial savings, improved road safety and a healthier environment. To assist motorists in becoming more conscious about saving fuel, AAA published its first Gas Watcher’s Guide in the 1970s during the oil crisis. The annual guide provides information on a variety of factors that affect fuel economy such as driving behaviors, keeping a vehicle well maintained, choosing the proper fuel, and choosing the most fuel-efficient vehicle for a family’s needs.[tpl]cite web |title=AAA 2010 Gas Watchers Guide |url=http://www.merchantcircle.com/blogs/Einsteins.Oilery.Meridian.ID.208-846-9188/2010/7/AAA-2010-Gas-Watchers-Guide/592371 |publisher=Einstein's Oilery |date=July 28, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-29[/tpl]
Over the years, AAA has encouraged consumers to use public transportation by including these transportation options in its travel guidebooks. AAA has also called on government to invest adequately in a multi-modal transportation system that is widely accessible and affordable. In comments to the National Journal AAA President and CEO Robert L. Darbelnet said that funding for high-speed rail from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is a “drop in the bucket” of what is needed, and that those funds would be well spent if, going forward, additional sources of investment could be identified.[tpl]cite news |first=Lisa |last=Caruso |title=Is Obama Spending The High-Speed Rail Money Wisely? |url=http://transportation.nationaljournal.com/2010/02/is-obama-spending-the-highspee.php |publisher=National Journal - Expert Blogs: Transportation |date=February 1, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100818235541/http://transportation.nationaljournal.com/2010/02/is-obama-spending-the-highspee.php| archivedate= 18 August 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In addition to encouraging fuel efficiency and conservation, AAA and other organizations initiated National Car Care Month during the 1980s to publicize the fact that poorly maintained vehicles contribute to excessive energy consumption and air pollution. AAA works in cooperation with businesses, civic groups, the government and the media in promoting and coordinating this annual event, held each October.[tpl]cite news |title=Free car care month event in Baltimore area features 40-point vehicle check, free windshield chip repair, Oct. 13 |url=http://www.gbc.org/news/1339/ |publisher=Greater Baltimore Committee |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate=2010-09-29[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=AAA Chicago Urges Motorists to Prepare Cars for Winter; Offers Free Car Inspections at AAA Approved Auto Repair Facilities as Incentive |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-13520094_ITM |publisher=PR Newswire |date=September 29, 2004 |accessdate=2010-09-29[/tpl]
In 1992, AAA launched a popular ecotourism promotion called Freedom's Way. With support from agencies such as the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency and others, AAA produced travel tips and public service messages encouraging travelers to help protect America's scenic areas and respect the environment. Topics included reducing congestion and pollution, conserving energy, disposing of litter and enjoying wildlife at a distance. The prevailing theme was that heavy use or abuse of a site damages the quality of the experience for everyone and sometimes even results in the closure of parks and recreation areas. The message was simple but effective.[tpl]cite news |first=Steve |last=Carlic |title=Ecotourism focuses on appreciating nature |url=http://blog.syracuse.com/green/2009/01/ecotourism_focuses_on_apprecia.html |publisher=The Post-Standard |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2010-10-06[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Greener Driving |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-06-29/business/9206270816_1_greener-driving-conserving-fuel-environmental-tips |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |date=1992-06-29 |accessdate=2010-10-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Green Travel on Vacation - with Style |url=http://www.travelsense.org/tips/greentravel.cfm |publisher=Travel Sense |accessdate=2010-10-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101005060444/http://www.travelsense.org/tips/greentravel.cfm| archivedate= 5 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
AAA clubs have also been a part of the organization’s century-long environmental advocacy efforts including:

===Criticism===

Despite its work promoting environmental responsibility in the automotive and transportation arenas, AAA's lobbying positions are perceived by some[tpl]who|date=April 2011[/tpl] as hostile to mass transit and environmental interests.
In 2006 the Automobile Club of Southern California worked against Prop. 87. The proposition would have established a "$4 billion program to reduce petroleum consumption (in California) by 25 percent, with research and production incentives for alternative energy, alternative energy vehicles, energy efficient technologies, and for education and training."[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
Daniel Becker, director of Sierra Club's global warming and energy program, described AAA as "a lobbyist for more roads, more pollution, and more gas guzzling."[tpl]cite journal |last=Rivlin |first=Michael A. |date=Winter 2001 |title=The Secret Life of AAA |journal=The Amicus Journal |url=http://www.transalt.org/files/newsroom/media/2001/010101amicus.html |accessdate=2008-09-16[/tpl]  He observed that among other lobbying activities, AAA issued a press release critical of the Clean Air Act, stating that it would "threaten the personal mobility of millions of Americans and jeopardize needed funds for new highway construction and safety improvements." "AAA spokespeople have criticized open-space measures and opposed U.S. EPA restrictions on smog, soot, and tailpipe emissions."[tpl]cite news |first=Michelle |last=Nijhuis |title=Road Warriors: A travel club provides a greener alternative to AAA |url=http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2003/02/11/warriors/ |work=Grist Magazine |date=2003-02-11 |accessdate=2008-09-16[/tpl]  "The club spent years battling stricter vehicle-emissions standards in Maryland, whose air, because of emissions and pollution from states upwind, is among the nation's worst."[tpl]cite journal |last=Silverstein |first=Ken |date=May 2002 |title=Smitten with a Club - Your AAA dues fuel pollution and sprawl |journal=Harper's Magazine |url=http://www.betterworldclub.com/articles/Harpers2002may.htm |accessdate=2008-09-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080820114516/http://betterworldclub.com/articles/harpers2002may.htm| archivedate= 20 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Response===

While AAA’s work on behalf of motorists and travelers seems at odds sometimes with its environmental stance, awareness of the underlying issues has led to greater understanding. For instance, in 2009, AAA asked the EPA not to increase the allowable ethanol content in gasoline from 10 percent to 15 percent citing several concerns affecting vehicle emissions, engine performance, system component damage, and vehicle warranty agreements among others. AAA said that more research needed to be done on the potential harmful effects prior to increasing the ethanol content in fuel.[tpl]cite web |title=AAA Calls for the EPA to Reject Petition to Increase Ethanol Content in Gasoline to 15 Percent |url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2009/07/22/470887.html |publisher=TheAutoChannel.com |date=July 22, 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-08[/tpl]
In another instance AAA supported the overall goal of the Clean Air Act, but objected to several specific provisions in the legislation, requesting clarification of the proposed state inspection and maintenance program provision and asking that the implementation guidelines be fully evaluated prior to enactment. According to a Washington Times article which referred to research by Energy & Environment Analysis Inc., tightening federal emissions standards had led to a role reversal for the automobile, making it less of a contributor to smog. Instead, stationary emission sources such as factories, as well as heavy and utility vehicles were more of a threat to air quality and would be appropriate targets in the battle against smog. “However, by primarily emphasizing vehicle regulations in the 1970s and ignoring gasoline regulations EPA actually caused fuels to become dirtier, effectively undermining a significant portion of any gains achieved through the tighter control of vehicles.” [tpl]cite web |first=Michael |last=Gough |title=Clearing the Air on EPA’s New Emissions Proposal |url=http://cei.org/studies-point/clearing-air-epa%E2%80%99s-new-emissions-proposal |publisher=Competitive Enterprise Institute |date=May 10, 1999 |accessdate=2010-10-08[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Matthew L. |last=Wald |title=Gasoline Prices to Rise in Many Areas |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/us/gasoline-prices-to-rise-in-many-areas.html?scp=1&sq=%22clean-air%20rules%22%20AND%20%22American%20Automobile%20Association%22&st=cse |publisher=The New York Times |date=November 9, 1994 |accessdate=2010-10-08[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |first=Eric |last=Peters |title=A Catalytic Con Job |url=|publisher=Investor's Business Daily |date=December 16, 1998 |accessdate=2010-10-08[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |first=Michael |last=Koontz |title=Clean Air and Transportation: The Facts may Surprise You |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/98julaug/clean.cfm |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=July–August 1998 |accessdate=2010-10-08[/tpl]
And more recently, although AAA supports the manufacture and use of hybrid vehicles, research by the British Columbia Automobile Association in 2010 shows that they do not result in significant financial savings for consumers, although they are often marketed that way.[tpl]cite news |title=Hybrid gas savings no deal says report |url=http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2010/07/22/con-hybrid-costs.html |publisher=CBC News |date=July 22, 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-08 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
In response to these concerns, several competing organizations have emerged, including Better World Club.  These organizations generally provide similar roadside assistance, trip planning and other services, in an environmentally friendly manner.  This includes discounts for fuel-efficient vehicles and donations to environmental organizations.
Also as a response to the critics, the California State Automobile Association, a branch of AAA, set up a booth at the San Francisco International Auto Show to raise awareness regarding plug-in hybrid vehicles.[tpl]cite press release |title=AAA showcases CalCars at SF Intl Auto Show Nov. 19-26 |publisher=CalCars |date=2005-11-04 |url=http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/190.html |accessdate=2008-09-16[/tpl]
