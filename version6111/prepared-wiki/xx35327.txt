[[Molar (tooth)]]

CATEGORIES: Types of teeth

Molars are the most posterior and most complicated kind of tooth in most mammals. In many mammals they grind food; hence the Latin name mola, "millstone". Molars show a great deal of diversity in size and shape across mammal groups.

==Human anatomy==

In humans, the molars are four- or five-cusped teeth. Adult humans have twelve molars, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. The third, rearmost molar in each group is called a wisdom tooth. It is the last tooth to appear, breaking through the front of the gum at about the age of twenty, although this varies from individual to individual. Ethnicity can also have an impact on the age at which this occurs, with statistical variations between groups.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rozkovcová|first=E|coauthors=Marková, M; Dolejsí, J|title=Studies on agenesis of third molars amongst populations of different origin.|journal=Sbornik lekarsky|year=1999|volume=100|issue=2|pages=71–84|pmid=11220165[/tpl] In some cases, it may not even erupt at all.
The human mouth contains upper (maxillary) and lower (mandibular) molars. They are: maxillary first molar, maxillary second molar, maxillary third molar, mandibular first molar, mandibular second molar, and mandibular third molar.

==Mammal evolution==

In mammals, the crown of the molars and premolars are folded into a wide range of complex shapes.  The basic elements of the crown are the more or less conical projections called cusps and the valleys that separate them.  The cusps contain both dentine and enamel, whereas minor projections on the crown, called crenullations, are the result of different enamel thickness.  Cusps are occasionally joined to form ridges and expanded to form crests.  Cingula are often incomplete ridges that pass around the base of the crown.[tpl]Harvnb|Zhao|Weiss|Stock|2000|loc= Acquisition of multi-cusped cheek teeth in mammals, p. 154[/tpl]
These mammalian multi-cusped cheek teeth probably evolved from single-cusped teeth in reptilians, although the diversity of therapsid molar patterns and the complexity in the molars of the earliest mammals makes it impossible to determine how this happened.  According to the widely accepted "differentiation theory" additional cusps have arisen by budding or outgrowth from the crown, while the rivalling "concrescence theory" instead proposes that complex teeth evolved by clustering of originally separate conical teeth.  It is generally agreed that therian mammals (placentals and marsupials) evolved from an ancestor with tribosphenic cheek teeth, with three main cusps arranged in a triangle.

==Morphology==

Each major cusp on an upper molar is called a cone and is identified by a prefix dependent on its relative location on the tooth: proto-, para-, meta-, hypo-, and ento-.  Suffixes are added to these names: -id is added to cusps on a lower molar (e.g., protoconid); -ule to a minor cusp (e.g., protoconulid).  A shelf-like ridge on the lower part of the crown (on an upper molar) is called a cingulum; the same feature on the lower molar a cingulid, and a minor cusp on these, for example, a cingular cuspule or conulid.[tpl]Harvnb|Myers|Espinosa|Parr|Jones|2013b[/tpl]
