A Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, usually known as the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers (NPNF), is a set of books containing translations of early Christian writings into English. It was published between 1886 and 1900.  Unlike the Ante-Nicene Fathers which was produced by using earlier translations of the Ante-Nicene Christian Library (ANCL), the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers was printed simultaneously in Europe and in America, by T. & T. Clark, by Christian Literature Company and other American editors. T. & T. Clark was surely convinced by the commercial success of the cheaper American version/revision of the ANCL, although of lesser quality on some minor points. An American (in fact a German American), Philip Schaff, was commissioned to supervise the first series of the NPNF.  He was joined by the British Henry Wace for the second series.
The volumes include the following:

==Saint Augustine Volumes==

==St. Chrysostom Volumes==

==Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Series II==
