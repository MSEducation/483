==Early life==

The twin brothers were born in Bray, Berkshire, England on 21 November 1913, to Rose Bennet and Arthur Boulting. They worked together as producer and director whenever they could, and often alternated these duties depending on the nature of each film, although they also made films separately. They were screenwriters for their own films. Their elder brother Sydney Boulting became an actor and stage producer as Peter Cotes; he was the original director of The Mousetrap.

==Careers==

They began with serious, tight, economical drama films such as Seven Days to Noon (1950) and Graham Greene's Brighton Rock (1947), both with Roy producing and John directing. They then became known for a series of satirical comedy films, such as Private's Progress (1956), Lucky Jim (1957) and I'm All Right Jack (1959). John Boulting co-wrote the films. The Boultings used the same actors in a lot of their films, including Ian Carmichael, Richard Attenborough, Terry-Thomas, Dennis Price, John Le Mesurier, Irene Handl, and Miles Malleson. I'm All Right Jack featured Peter Sellers, boosting his film career, winning him a BAFTA Best Actor Award. In the 1980s, Roy Boulting directed the Miss Marple mysteries for the BBC.
