Canis Minor [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|k|eɪ|n|ɨ|s|_|ˈ|m|aɪ|n|ər[/tpl] is a small constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. In the second century, it was included as an asterism, or pattern, of two stars in Ptolemy's 48 constellations, and is counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for "lesser dog" in contrast to Canis Major, the "greater dog"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of Orion the hunter.
Canis Minor contains only two stars brighter than the fourth magnitude, Procyon (Alpha Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 0.34, and Gomeisa (Beta Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 2.9. The constellation's dimmer stars were noted by Johann Bayer, who named eight stars including Alpha and Beta, and John Flamsteed, who numbered fourteen. Procyon is the seventh-brightest star in the night sky, as well as one of the closest. A yellow-white main sequence star, it has a white dwarf companion. Gomeisa is a blue-white main sequence star. Luyten's Star is a ninth-magnitude red dwarf and the Solar System's next closest stellar neighbour in the constellation after Procyon. The fourth-magnitude HD 66141, which has evolved into an orange giant towards the end of its life cycle, was discovered to have a planet in 2012. There are two faint deep sky objects within the constellation's borders. The 11 Canis-Minorids are a meteor shower that can be seen in early December.

==History and mythology==

Though strongly associated with the Classical Greek uranographic tradition, Canis Minor originates from ancient Mesopotamia. Procyon and Gomeisa were called MASH.TAB.BA or "twins" in the Three Stars Each tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later MUL.APIN, this name was also applied to the pairs of Pi3 and Pi4 Orionis and Zeta and Xi Orionis. The meaning of MASH.TAB.BA evolved as well, becoming the twin deities Lulal and Latarak, who are on the opposite side of the sky from Papsukal, the True Shepherd of Heaven in Babylonian mythology. Canis Minor was also given the name DAR.LUGAL, which translates to "the star which stands behind it", in the MUL.APIN; the constellation represents a rooster. This name may have also referred to the constellation Lepus.[tpl]cite journal | first=John H. | last=Rogers | year=1998 | title=Origins of the Ancient Constellations: I.

Canis Minor was one of the original 48 constellations formulated by Ptolemy in his second-century Almagest, in which it was defined as a specific pattern (asterism) of stars; Ptolemy identified only two stars and hence no depiction was possible. The Ancient Greeks called the constellation προκυων/Procyon, "coming before the dog", transliterated into Latin as Antecanis, Praecanis, or variations thereof, by Cicero and others. Roman writers also appended the descriptors parvus, minor or minusculus ("small" or "lesser", for its faintness), septentrionalis ("northerly", for its position in relation to Canis Major), primus (rising "first") or sinister (rising to the "left") to its name Canis.[tpl]cite book | last=Allen | first=Richard Hinckley | year=1963 | origyear=1899 | title=Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning | edition=corrected | publisher=Dover Publications | location=Mineola, New York | isbn = 978-0-486-21079-7 | page=383 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_GUDis0bETgC&pg=PA133[/tpl] 
In Greek mythology, Canis Minor was sometimes connected with the Teumessian Fox, a beast turned into stone with its hunter, Laelaps, by Zeus, who placed them in heaven as Canis Major (Laelaps) and Canis Minor (Teumessian Fox).Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3,192.[tpl]cite book |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yMbzhPrIkt4C&pg=PA275 |title = Nature Guide Stars and Planets |page = 275 |author = DK Publishing |publisher = Penguin |year = 2012 |isbn = 978-1-4654-0353-7[/tpl] Eratosthenes accompanied the Little Dog with Orion, while Hyginus linked the constellation with Maera, a dog owned by Icarius of Athens.[tpl]cite book|last=Klepešta|first=Josef|coauthors=Rükl, Antonín|title=Constellations|publisher=Hamlyn|location=London, England|year=1974|origyear=1969|pages=118–19 | isbn = 978-0-600-00893-4 [/tpl] On discovering the latter's death, the dog and Icarius' daughter Erigone took their lives and all three were placed in the sky—Erigone as Virgo and Icarius as Boötes.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/canisminor.htm |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |title = Canis Minor | accessdate = 26 May 2012 |work = Star Tales[/tpl] As a reward for his faithfulness, the dog was placed along the "banks" of the Milky Way, which the ancients believed to be a heavenly river, where he would never suffer from thirst.Mark R.

The medieval Arabic astronomers maintained the depiction of Canis Minor (al-Kalb al-Asghar in Arabic) as a dog; in his Book of the Fixed Stars, Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi included a diagram of the constellation with a canine figure superimposed.[tpl]cite journal |pages =  179–197 195–96 |title = A Manuscript of "The Book of the Fixed Stars" by ʿAbd Ar-Raḥmān Aṣ-Ṣūfī |first = Joseph M. |last = Upton |journal = Metropolitan Museum Studies |volume = 4 |issue = 2 |date = March 1933 |publisher = The Metropolitan Museum of Art | jstor = 1522800 |doi =  10.2307/1522800[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pages =  1–26 12 |first = Emmy |last = Wellesz |title = An Early al-Ṣūfī Manuscript in the Bodleian Library in Oxford: A Study in Islamic Constellation Images |journal = Ars Orientalis |year = 1959 |volume = 3 |jstor = 4629096 |publisher = Freer Gallery of Art, The Smithsonian Institution and Department of the History of Art, University of Michigan[/tpl] There was one slight difference between the Ptolemaic vision of Canis Minor and the Arabic; al-Sufi claims Mirzam, now assigned to Orion, as part of both Canis Minor—the collar of the dog—and its modern home. The Arabic names for both Procyon and Gomeisa alluded to their proximity and resemblance to Sirius, though they were not direct translations of the Greek; Procyon was called ash-Shi'ra ash-Shamiya, the "Syrian Sirius" and Gomeisa was called ash-Shira al-Ghamisa, the Sirius with bleary eyes. Among the Merazig of Tunisia, shepherds note six constellations that mark the passage of the dry, hot season. One of them, called Merzem, includes the stars of Canis Minor and Canis Major and is the herald of two weeks of hot weather.[tpl]cite journal |title = A Review of African Ethno-Astronomy: With Particular Reference to Saharan Livestock-Keepers |last = Oxby |first = Claire |journal = La Ricerca Folklorica |date = October 1999 |pages = 57–58 | jstor = 1479768 |issue = 40[/tpl]
The ancient Egyptians thought of this constellation as Anubis, the jackal god.Chartrand, p. 126.
Alternative names have been proposed: Johann Bayer in the early 17th century termed the constellation Fovea "The Pit", and Morus "Sycamine Tree". Seventeenth-century German poet and author Philippus Caesius linked it to the dog of Tobias from the Apocrypha. Richard A. Proctor gave the constellation the name Felis "the Cat" in 1870 (contrasting with Canis Major, which he had abbreviated to Canis "the Dog"), explaining that he sought to shorten the constellation names to make them more manageable on celestial charts.[tpl]cite book  | last = Proctor  | first = Richard Anthony  | authorlink = Richard A.

===In non-Western astronomy===

In Chinese astronomy, the stars corresponding to Canis Minor lie in the The Vermilion Bird of the South (南方朱雀, Nán Fāng Zhū Què). Procyon, Gomeisa and Eta Canis Minoris form an asterism known as Nánhé, the Southern River.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |author1 = 陳冠中 |author2 = 陳輝樺 |url = http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060716.html |publisher = AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) |title = 天文教育資訊網 |date = 16 July 2006[/tpl] With its counterpart, the Northern River Beihe (Castor and Pollux), Nánhé was also associated with a gate or sentry. Along with Zeta and 8 Cancri, 6 Canis Minoris and 11 Canis Minoris formed the asterism Shuiwei, which literally means "water level". Combined with additional stars in Gemini, Shuiwei represented an official who managed floodwaters or a marker of the water level. Neighboring Korea recognized four stars in Canis Minor as part of a different constellation, "the position of the water". This constellation was located in the Red Bird, the southern portion of the sky.[tpl]cite journal |title = A Korean Star Map |last1 = Rufus |first1 = W.

Polynesian peoples often did not recognize Canis Minor as a constellation, but they saw Procyon as significant and often named it; in the Tuamotu Archipelago it was known as Hiro, meaning "twist as a thread of coconut fiber", and Kopu-nui-o-Hiro ("great paunch of Hiro"), which was either a name for the modern figure of Canis Minor or an alternative name for Procyon. Other names included Vena (after a goddess), on Mangaia and Puanga-hori (false Puanga, the name for Rigel), in New Zealand. In the Society Islands, Procyon was called Ana-tahua-vahine-o-toa-te-manava, literally "Aster the priestess of brave heart", figuratively the "pillar for elocution".[tpl]cite book| last = Makemson | first = Maud Worcester | year = 1941 | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | title = The Morning Star Rises: An Account of Polynesian Astronomy | ref = harv | pages = 199, 209, 247, 267, 280[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title = Tahitian Astronomy: Birth of the Heavenly Bodies |last = Henry |first = Teuira |journal = The Journal of the Polynesian Society |volume = 16 |issue = 2 |pages= 101–04 |date = June 1907 | jstor = 20700813[/tpl] The Wardaman people of the Northern Territory in Australia gave Procyon and Gomeisa the names Magum and Gurumana, describing them as humans who were transformed into gum trees in the dreamtime.

The WZ Sagittae-type dwarf nova DY CMi (also known as VSX J074727.6+065050) flared up to magnitude 11.4 over January and February 2008 before dropping eight magnitudes to around 19.5 over approximately 80 days. It is a remote binary star system where a white dwarf and low mass star orbit each other close enough for the former star to draw material off the latter and form an accretion disc. This material builds up until it erupts dramatically.[tpl]cite journal|last=Shears, Jeremy;  Brady, Steve; Bolt, Greg; Campbell, Tut; Collins, Donald F.; Cook, Lewis M.; Crawford, Timothy R.; Koff, Robert; Krajci, Tom; McCormick, Jennie; Nelson, Peter;  Patterson, Joseph; Ponthière, Pierre de; Potter, Mike; Rea, Robert; Roberts, George; Sabo, Richard; Staels, Bart; Vanmunster, Tonny  |year=2009|title=VSX J074727.6+065050: A New WZ Sagittae Star in Canis Minor |journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association|volume=119|issue=6|pages=340–46 |url=http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0905/0905.0061.pdf|arxiv = 0905.0061 |bibcode = 2009JBAA..119..340S [/tpl]
