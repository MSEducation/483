David Joel Horowitz (born January 10, 1939) is an American conservative writer. He is a founder and current president of the think tank the David Horowitz Freedom Center, editor of FrontPage Magazine, and director of Discover the Networks, a website that tracks individuals and groups on the political left. Horowitz founded the organization Students for Academic Freedom, whose self-stated goal is combating what it calls the "leftist indoctrination" in academia.
Horowitz was raised by parents who were members of the Communist Party USA. Between 1956 and 1975, Horowitz was an outspoken adherent of the New Left before rejecting leftism completely. Horowitz has recounted his ideological journey in a series of retrospectives, culminating with his 1996 memoir Radical Son: A Generational Odyssey.

==Family==

Horowitz was born to a Secular Jewish family in Forest Hills, New York City. His parents, Phil and Blanche Horowitz, were high school teachers. Phil taught English and Blanche taught stenography.[tpl]cite book|last=Horowitz|first=David|title=Radical Son: A Generational Odyssey|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York, NY|year=1997|page=25[/tpl] Horowitz majored in English and received a BA from Columbia University in 1959 and a master's degree in English literature at University of California, Berkeley.
Phil and Blanche Horowitz were long-standing members of the American Communist Party and avid supporters of Joseph Stalin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://97.74.65.51/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=27747|title=Radical Son, Revisited|last=Chapin|first=Bernard|date=14 August 2007|accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]Horowitz, David. Radical Son, 39–40.
According to Horowitz,  "Underneath the ordinary surfaces of their lives, my parents and their friends thought of themselves as secret agents. The mission they had undertaken, and about which they could not speak freely except with each other, was not just an idea to them. It was more important to their sense of themselves than anything else they did. Nor were its tasks of a kind they could attend or ignore, depending on their moods. They were more like the obligations of a religious faith. Except that their faith was secular, and the millennium they awaited was being instituted, at that moment, in the very country that had become America's enemy. It was this fact that made their ordinary lives precarious and their secrecy necessary. If they lived under a cloud of suspicion, it was the result of more than just their political passions. The dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima had created a terror in the minds of ordinary people. Newspapers reported on American spy rings working to steal atomic secrets for the Soviet state. When people read these stories, they inevitably thought of progressives like us. And so did we ourselves. Even if we never encountered a Soviet agent or engaged in a single illegal act, each of us knew that our commitment to socialism implied the obligation to commit treason, too."Radical Son, page 75. 
After the death of Stalin in 1953, Phil Horowitz, commenting on how the numerous official titles held by Stalin had to be divided among his successors, told his son, "You see what a genius Stalin was. It took five men to replace him."Radical Son, page 81.

==Career in the New Left==

The Horowitz family broke with the American Communist Party after the publication of Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech in 1956. According to Horowitz,  "The publication of the Khrushchev Report was probably the greatest blow struck against the Soviet Empire during the Cold War. When my parents and their friends opened the morning Times and read its text, their world collapsed – and along with it their will to struggle. If the document was true, almost everything they had said and believed was false. Their secret mission had led them into waters so deep that its tide had overwhelmed them, taking with it the very meaning of their lives."Radical Son, page 84. 
In the early 1960s, Horowitz lived in London as an employee of the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.creators.com/opinion/alexander-cockburn/it-s-islamo-fascism-awareness-week-coming-to-a-campus-near-you.html|title=It's Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week, Coming to a Campus Near You!|author=Alexander Cockburn|date=27 October 2007|publisher=creators.com[/tpl] originally published in Counterpunch 27 October 2007[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/368222/witness-part-i-jay-nordlinger|author=Jay Nordlinger|newspaper=National Review Online|title=A Witness, Part I: The meaning of David Horowitz|date=14 January 2014[/tpl] He regarded himself as a serious Marxist intellectual. In 1966, Ralph Schoenman persuaded Bertrand Russell to convene a war crimes tribunal to judge American involvement in the Vietnam War.Radical Son, page 146-153. Horowitz developed serious reservations about the process when the tribunal's judges, who included Isaac Deutscher, Jean-Paul Sartre, Stokely Carmichael, Simone de Beauvoir, James Baldwin, and Vladimir Dedijer, degenerated into a feuding rabble.Radical Son, pages 148–153. See Russell Tribunal.
While in London, Horowitz was a close friend of Deutscher, of whom he published a biography in 1971.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-155477123.html|title=Confronting the enemy within|last=Soupcoff|first=Marni|date=20 November 2006|publisher=Western Standard |accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl]Isaac Deutscher: The Man and his work. London: Macdonald, 1971. He also wrote The Free World Colossus: A Critique of American Foreign Policy in the Cold War.
In January 1968, Horowitz returned to the United States and became co-editor of the New Left magazine, Ramparts.
During the early 1970s, Horowitz developed a close friendship with Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton. In Horowitz's subsequent writings, Newton is depicted as equal parts gangster, terrorist, intellectual, and media celebrity.
As part of their work together, Horowitz helped raised money for Newton and assisted with the running of a school for the children of Party members. He further recommended that Newton hire a bookkeeper, Betty Van Patter, who was then working for Ramparts. In December 1974, Van Patter's murdered body was found floating in San Francisco Harbor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/print/article/david-horowitzs-long-march |title=David Horowitz's Long March |publisher=Thenation.com |date= |accessdate=23 April 2013[/tpl] Horowitz, who was certain that the Panthers were responsible, had his suspicions confirmed by several Party members. He has cited that experience as the catalyst which led him to reject Marxism completely.

==Activism on the right==

For nearly a decade, Horowitz's rejection of Marx remained a private matter. In the spring of 1985, however, Horowitz and longtime collaborator Peter Collier wrote an article for The Washington Post entitled "Goodbye to All That". The article explained their change of views and recent decision to vote for President Ronald Reagan.Radical Son, pages 356–357. In 1986 he published "Why I Am No Longer a Leftist" in the Village Voice.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/368496/witness-part-ii-jay-nordlinger|title=A Witness, Part II: The meaning of David Horowitz|author=Jay Nordlinger|newspaper=National Review Online|date=January 15, 2014[/tpl] Horowitz has not been completely welcomed by the conservative right. Jay Nordlinger says conservatives are uneasy with Horowitz' activism and confrontational style.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/368605/witness-part-iii-jay-nordlinger|title=A Witness, Part III: The meaning of David Horowitz |date=16 January 2014|newspaper=National Review Online|author=Jay Nordlinger[/tpl]
In 1987, Horowitz co-hosted a "Second Thoughts Conference" in Washington, D.C., described by Sidney Blumenthal in The Washington Post as his "coming out" as a social conservative. According to attendee Alexander Cockburn, Horowitz related how his Stalinist parents had not permitted him or his sister to watch Doris Day and Rock Hudson movies. Instead, they were required to watch propaganda films from the Soviet Union.Cockburn, Alexander. "A Whiner Called David Horowitz Moans at Sid Blumenthal and Imagined CIA Slur; A Commie Called Graydon Carter; What Chavez Said to Lula, CounterPunch, 31 May 2003
In May 1989, Horowitz, Ronald Radosh, and Peter Collier travelled to Poland for a conference in Kraków calling for the end of Communism.Radical Son, page 388. After marching with Polish dissidents in an anti-regime protest, Horowitz declared,  "For myself, my family tradition of socialist dreams is over. Socialism is no longer a dream of a revolutionary future. It is only a nightmare of the past. But for you, the nightmare is not a dream. It is a reality that is still happening. My dream for the people of socialist Poland is that someday you will wake up from your nightmare and be free."Radical Son, page 391. 
In 1992, Horowitz and Collier founded Heterodoxy magazine. The magazine focused on exposing excessive political correctness on American college and university campuses. About the decision, Horowitz has stated,  "As an undergraduate at Columbia in the McCarthy Fifties, I had written papers from a Marxist point of view, but had never been graded politically by my anti-communist professors. Nor had I ever felt that the lectures I attended were veiled indoctrinations. As a student, I was invariably presented with both sides of an argument. When I visited university campuses now, however, the contrast was striking. Courses were often baldly ideological. Many left-wing professors gave one-sided presentations of subjects, expecting their views to be parroted on papers and exams. Students were graded politically, and frequently intimidated from expressing their own perspectives. The atmosphere of political terror was far greater than anything which I had experienced, as a Marxist, in the McCarthy era. Although there was no statistical evidence to prove it, I would estimate that more academic careers had been aborted for political reasons during those post-Sixties decades than during the entire Communist 'witch hunt' of the McCarthy period. The reason for the lack of statistics was the same as for the effectiveness of the purge. Unlike the McCarthyites, whose base was government, the left-wing witch-hunters were inside the academy, where they could operate in secrecy and to far greater effect."Radical Son, pages 405–406. 
Horowitz has also opposed reparations for slavery as something inherently racist against blacks. He argues that applying labels like "descendents of slaves" to blacks would damage their self-esteem and segregate them from mainstream society.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=1153 |title=Ten Reasons Why Reparations for Blacks is a Bad Idea for Blacks – and Racist Too |accessdate=1 February 2007| first=David |last=Horowitz |date=3 January 2001 |publisher=FrontPageMagazine.com [/tpl] Horowitz purchased, or attempted to purchase, advertising space in school publications in order to publicize his opinion that African Americans are not entitled to reparations for Slavery in the United States. Many of these offers were refused and, at some schools, papers which carried the ads were stolen or destroyed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2001/03/09/horowitz/ |title=Who's afraid of the big, bad Horowitz? |accessdate=1 February 2007 |first=Joan |last=Walsh |date=9 March 2001 |publisher=Salon.com [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.projo.com/words/brown2.htm |title=Embattled editors get Herald out at Brown |accessdate=1 February 2007 |first=Si |last=Rosenbaum| date=18 March 2001 |publisher=The Providence Journal Company [/tpl]
While he supported the interventionist foreign policy associated with the Bush Doctrine, Horowitz opposed American intervention in the Kosovo War, arguing that it was unnecessary and harmful to U.S. interests.22/Feb/1999 Clinton Kosovo Intervention Appears Imminent[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=1196 |title=Stop This War |accessdate=1 February 2007 |first=David |last=Horowitz |date=11 May 1999 |publisher=FrontPageMagazine.com [/tpl] He has recently been critical of libertarian anti-war views.[tpl]cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0711/12/gb.01.html |title=CNN.com – Transcripts |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=12 November 2007 |accessdate=23 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Horowitz | first = David | year = 2007 | url = http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.aspx?GUID=ca5cfcde-651b-45d1-b93a-dff2f3912525 | title = Indoctrination U | work = FrontPageMagazine.com | publisher = FrontPageMagazine.com | accessdate = 5 March 2007[/tpl]
In 2004, Horowitz launched Discover the Networks, a conservative watchdog project that monitors funding for, and various ties among, leftists and progressive causes.[tpl]cite web|title=Our Mission – Updated June 2013|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/about/about-fpm/|work=David Horowitz|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] In his 2004 book, Unholy Alliance: Radical Islam and the American Left, Horowitz contends that leftists support, intentionally or not, Islamist terrorism, and thus require ongoing scrutiny.
In two books, Horowitz accused Dana L. Cloud, associate professor of communication studies at the University of Texas at Austin, as an “anti-American radical" who "routinely repeats the propaganda of the Saddam regime" and, along with all of the 99 other professors in his book, The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America, Horowitz accuses her of the "explicit introduction of political agendas into the classroom." (pp. 93, 377)
He felt his claim was substantiated when Cloud stated after 9/11 that: "the United States military has, in recent years, been the most effective and constant killer of civilians around the world."
Cloud replied in Inside Higher Ed that her experience demonstrates that Horowitz does real damage to professors' lives—and that he needs to be viewed as such, not just as a political opponent.
 Horowitz's attacks have been significant. People who read the book or his Web site regularly send letters to university officials asking for her to be fired. Personally, she has received—mostly via e-mail—"physical threats, threats of removing my daughter from my custody, threats of sexual assaults, horrible disgusting gendered things," she said. That Horowitz doesn't send these isn't the point, she said. "He builds a climate and culture that emboldens people," and as a result, shouldn't be seen as a defender of academic freedom, but as its enemy.
 "Communicating About David Horowitz" in Insider Higher Ed February 19, 2008 
After discussion, the National Communication Association chose not to grant Horowitz a spot as a panelist at its national conference in 2008, even after he agreed to forego the $7,000 speaking fee he had requested.
Horowitz replied, "The fact that no academic group has had the balls to invite me says a lot about the ability of academic associations to discuss important issues if a political minority wants to censor them." An association official said the decision was based in part on Horowitz's request to be provided with a stipend for $500 to hire a personal bodyguard. Association officials decided that having a bodyguard present "communicates the expectation of confrontation and violence."
While Horowitz was on the Riz Khan television show with Hussein Ibish, he was reported by Ibish to have published on his Frontpage Mag website: Arabs do nothing on impulse, Muslims have no allegiance to their countries, and their only allegiance is to Islam, that's what they have been taught since birth that's all they know, Muslims have no borders"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqyQnMkMrjw |title=al-Jazeera news: Riz Khan show, 08/21/08, at marker number 4.01 |publisher=Youtube.com |date=25 August 2008 |accessdate=23 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/rizkhan/2008/08/200882191616950380.html |title=al-Jazeera news: Riz Khan show, transcript for 8/21/08 |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date= |accessdate=23 April 2013[/tpl]

==Academic Bill of Rights==

The issue of alleged political abuse by universities is currently Horowitz's main focus. He, Eli Lehrer, and Andrew Jones published a pamphlet, "Political Bias in the Administrations and Faculties of 32 Elite Colleges and Universities" (2004), in which they find the ratio of Democrats to Republicans at 32 schools to be more than 10 to 1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/apr/20/20040420-084524-4394r/|title=College update|last=Williams|first=Walter|date=20 April 2004|publisher=The Washington Times|accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl]
Horowitz's book, The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America (2006), criticizes individual professors for their professorial conduct. Horowitz accuses these professors of engaging in indoctrination rather than a disinterested pursuit of knowledge. Horowitz states that his campaign for academic freedom is ideologically neutral.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cms.studentsforacademicfreedom.org//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2&Itemid=5 |title=About Students for Academic Freedom |accessdate=1 February 2007 |publisher=Students For Academic Freedom [/tpl]
Horowitz and others promote his Academic Bill of Rights (ABR), an eight-point guide that seeks to eliminate political bias in university hiring and grading. Horowitz says that bias in universities amounts to indoctrination, and charges that conservatives and particularly Republicans are systematically excluded from faculties, citing statistical studies on faculty party affiliation.[tpl]cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/2005/10/11/opinion/11tierney.html |title=Where Cronies Dwell |accessdate=1 February 2007 |first=John |last=Tierney |date=11 October 2005 |publisher=New York Times [/tpl] Critics of the proposed policy, such as Stanley Fish, have argued that "academic diversity", as Horowitz describes it, is not a legitimate academic value, and that no endorsement of "diversity" can be absolute.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/free/v50/i23/23b01301.htm|title='Intellectual Diversity': the Trojan Horse of a Dark Design|accessdate=2 February 2007|first=Stanley|last=Fish |date=13 February 2004|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education [/tpl]

===Allegations of racism===

Chip Berlet, writing for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), identified Horowitz's Center for the Study of Popular Culture as one of 17 "right-wing foundations and think tanks supporting efforts to make bigoted and discredited ideas respectable." Berlet accused Horowitz of blaming slavery on "black Africans … abetted by dark-skinned Arabs" and of "attacking minority 'demands for special treatment' as 'only necessary because some blacks can't seem to locate the ladder of opportunity within reach of others,' rejecting the idea that they could be the victims of lingering racism."[tpl]cite web|last = Berlet|first = Chip|year = 2003|url = http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=105|title = Into the Mainstream|work = Intelligence Report|publisher = Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate = 23 April 2006[/tpl] Responding with an open letter to Morris Dees, president of the SPLC, Horowitz opens with the claim that Berlet's report was "so tendentious, so filled with transparent misrepresentations and smears that if "continues to post the report he will create for the Southern Poverty Law Center a well-earned reputation as a hate group itself." He claims the intention of "reminder that the slaves transported to America were bought from African and Arab slavers" was a response to demands that only whites pay blacks reparations, and he never held Africans and Arabs solely responsible for slavery. He concludes that the accusation of racism was a deliberate and calculated lie and requests that the report be removed.[tpl]cite web | last = Horowitz | first = David | authorlink = David Horowitz (conservative writer) | year = 2003 | url = http://www.frontpagemagazine.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=9622 | title = An Open Letter To Morris Dees | work = FrontPageMagazine.com | publisher = FrontPageMagazine.com | accessdate = 23 April 2006[/tpl] The SPLC refused Horowitz's request,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/articles/readarticle.asp?ID=9831 |title=FrontPage Magazine – Response to David Horowitz's Complaint |publisher=Frontpagemag.com |date= |accessdate=23 April 2013[/tpl] and subsequent critical pieces on Berlet and the SPLC have been featured on Horowitz's website and personal blog.FrontPage Magazine[tpl]cite web | last = Arabia | first = Chris | year = 2003 | url = http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=10352 | title = Chip Berlet: Leftist Lie Factory | work = FrontPageMagazine.com | publisher = FrontPageMagazine.com | accessdate = 23 April 2006[/tpl]

The MSA responded by saying they were a peaceful organization and not a political group. The MSA's faculty advisor said the group had "been involved in interfaith activities with Jewish student groups, and they've been involved in charity work for national disaster relief."
Around the same time Horowitz also ran the ad in The GW Hatchet, claiming the MSA was a radical group.
