</ref> The transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and assembly of rRNA occurs in the nucleolus, aided by [[small nucleolar RNA]] (snoRNA) molecules, some of which are derived from spliced [[intron]]s from [[messenger RNA]]s encoding genes related to ribosomal function. The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear pores.<ref name="Lodish" />
When observed under the electron microscope, the nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost fibrillar centers (FCs), surrounded by the dense fibrillar component (DFC), which in turn is bordered by the granular component (GC). Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.

===Other subnuclear bodies===

Besides the nucleolus, the nucleus contains a number of other non-membrane-delineated bodies. These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, paraspeckles, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.
Other subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods has been reported in some cases of nemaline myopathy. This condition typically results from mutations in actin, and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins.[tpl]cite  journal  | last =Goebel| first =H.H. |author2=I Warlow| month=January | year =1997 | title =Nemaline myopathy with intranuclear rods—intranuclear rod myopathy| journal =Neuromuscular Disorders | volume =7 | issue =1 | pages =13–19 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-8966(96)00404-X| pmid =9132135 | url =  [/tpl]

====Cajal bodies and gems====

A nucleus typically contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2 µm and 2.0 µm depending on the cell type and species. When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin.[tpl]cite  journal  | author = Matera AG, Frey MA. | title = Coiled Bodies and Gems: Janus or Gemini? | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 317–321 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9683623  | doi = 10.1086/301992  [/tpl] CBs are involved in a number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification.
Similar to Cajal bodies are Gemini of coiled bodies, or gems, whose name is derived from the Gemini constellation in reference to their close "twin" relationship with CBs. Gems are similar in size and shape to CBs, and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), but do contain a protein called survivor of motor neurons (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis,[ref]
</ref> though it has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that CBs and gems are different manifestations of the same structure.<ref name="MateraFrey" />

====RAFA and PTF domains====

RAFA domains, or polymorphic interphase karyosomal associations, were first described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function was and remains unclear, though they were not thought to be associated with active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing.[tpl]cite  journal  | author = Saunders WS, Cooke CA, Earnshaw WC | title = Compartmentalization within the nucleus: discovery of a novel subnuclear region. | journal = Journal of Cellular Biology | volume = 115 | issue = 4 | pages = 919–931 | year = 1991  | doi = 10.1083/jcb.115.4.919  [/tpl] PMID 1955462 They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of snRNA.[tpl]cite  journal  | author = Pombo A, Cuello P, Schul W, Yoon J, Roeder R, Cook P, Murphy S | title = Regional and temporal specialization in the nucleus: a transcriptionally active nuclear domain rich in PTF, Oct1 and PIKA antigens associates with specific chromosomes early in the cell cycle | journal = The EMBO Journal| volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 1768–1778 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9501098 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/17.6.1768  [/tpl]

====PML bodies====

Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found scattered throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0 µm. They are known by a number of other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the Promyelocytic leukemia protein. They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong to the nuclear matrix, an ill-defined super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or epigenetic silencing.[tpl]Cite pmid| 20452955[/tpl] The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be sumoylated. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions.

====[tpl]anchor|Splicing speckles[/tpl] Splicing speckles====

Speckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and are located in the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells. At the fluorescence-microscope level they appear as irregular, punctate structures, which vary in size and shape, and when examined by electron microscopy they are seen as clusters of interchromatin granules. Speckles are dynamic structures, and both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations, including active transcription sites. Studies on the composition, structure and behaviour of speckles have provided a model for understanding the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus and the organization of the gene-expression machinery.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lamond AI, Spector DL |title=Nuclear speckles: a model for nuclear organelles |journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=605–12 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12923522 |doi=10.1038/nrm1172 |url=[/tpl]

The splicing speckles are also known as nuclear speckles (nuclear specks), splicing factor compartments (SF compartments), interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), B snurposomes.[ref]

</ref>
B snurposomes are found in the amphibian oocyte nuclei and in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. B snurposomes appear alone or attached to the Cajal bodies in the electron micrographs of the amphibian nuclei.
IGCs function as storage sites for the splicing factors.

====Paraspeckles====

Discovered by Fox et al. in 2002, paraspeckles are irregularly shaped compartments in the nucleus' interchromatin space.[tpl]cite journal |author= Fox, Archa |year=2002|url=http://www.current-biology.com/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS0960982201006327 |title=Paraspeckles:A Novel Nuclear Domain|journal=Current Biology |volume=12 |pages=13–25 |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00632-7 | pmid=11790299 | last2=Lam | first2=YW | last3=Leung | first3=AK | last4=Lyon | first4=CE | last5=Andersen | first5=J | last6=Mann | first6=M | last7=Lamond | first7=AI | issue=1[/tpl]  First documented in HeLa cells, where there are generally 10–30 per nucleus,[ref]
</ref> paraspeckles are now known to also exist in all human primary cells, transformed cell lines, and tissue sections.<ref name="para3">[tpl]cite  journal  |author= Fox, A. et al. |year= 2005 |url= http://www.molbiolcell.org/cgi/reprint/16/11/5304 |title= P54nrb Forms a Heterodimer with PSP1 That Localizes to Paraspeckles in an RNA-dependent Manner  | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E05-06-0587 |journal= Molecular Biology of the Cell |volume=16 |pages=5304–5315  | pmid = 16148043 | pmc=1266428 | issue=11[/tpl]</ref> Their name is derived from their distribution in the nucleus; the "para" is short for parallel and the "speckles" refers to the splicing speckles to which they are always in close proximity.<ref name="para2"/>
Paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity. They are transcription dependent and in the absence of RNA Pol II transcription, the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated protein components  (PSP1, p54nrb, PSP2, CFI(m)68, and PSF) form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the nucleolus. This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle. In the cell cycle, paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase. During telophase, when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no RNA Pol II transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap.

====[tpl]anchor|Perichromatin fibrils[/tpl] Perichromatin fibrils====

Perichromatin fibrils are visible only under electron microscope. They are located next to the transcriptionally active chromatin and is hypothesized to be the site of active pre-mRNA processing.

==Function==

The nucleus provides a site for genetic transcription that is segregated from the location of translation in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of gene regulation that are not available to prokaryotes. The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle.

===Cell compartmentalization===

The nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus,[tpl]cite book | last =Lehninger | first =Albert L. | coauthors =David L. Nelson, Michael M. Cox. | title =Lehninger principles of biochemistry | edition =3rd | year =2000 | publisher =Worth Publishers | location =New York | isbn = 1-57259-931-6 [/tpl] where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.[tpl]cite  journal | author=Moreno F, Ahuatzi D, Riera A, Palomino CA, Herrero P. |year=2005 |title = Glucose sensing through the Hxk2-dependent signalling pathway. |journal=Biochem Soc Trans | volume =  33 | issue = 1 |pages = 265–268 | pmid = 15667322  | doi = 10.1042/BST0330265  [/tpl] PMID 15667322
In order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.
The compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA.[tpl]cite  journal  | last = Görlich | first = Dirk |author2=Ulrike Kutay | title = Transport between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm | journal = Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. | volume =15 | issue = 1 | pages = 607–660 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10611974  | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.15.1.607  [/tpl] Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in misformed and nonfunctional proteins.

===Gene expression===

Gene expression first involves transcription, in which DNA is used as a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA (mRNA), which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported.[tpl]cite book |title=Protein Synthesis and Ribosome Structure: Translating the Genome |last=Nierhaus |first=Knud H. |author2=Daniel N. Wilson |year=2004 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |isbn=3-527-30638-2 [/tpl]
Since the nucleus is the site of transcription, it also contains a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include helicases, which unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerases, which synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerases, which change the amount of supercoiling in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of transcription factors that regulate expression.[tpl]cite book |title=Genome Structure and Function: From Chromosomes Characterization to Genes Technology |last=Nicolini |first=Claudio A. |year=1997 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-7923-4565-7 [/tpl]

===Processing of pre-mRNA===

Newly synthesized mRNA molecules are known as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation. The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete.
RNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the spliceosome, is the process by which introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.

==Dynamics and regulation==

===Nuclear transport===

The entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes. Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation,[tpl]cite book | last = Watson | first = JD | coauthors = Baker TA, Bell SP, Gann A, Levine M, Losick R. | title = Molecular Biology of the Gene | publisher = Peason Benjamin Cummings; CSHL Press. | year = 2004 | edition = 5th | chapter = Ch9–10 | isbn = 0-8053-9603-9 [/tpl] macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit. "Cargo" proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals, which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins. The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by GTPases, enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is Ran, which can bind either GTP or GDP (guanosine diphosphate), depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.
Nuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.
Specialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' central role in protein translation; mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.

===Assembly and disassembly===

During its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down, either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis (the process of programmed cell death). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus — the envelope and lamina — can be systematically degraded.
In most cells, the disassembly of the nuclear envelope marks the end of the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.
At a certain point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope.[tpl]cite  journal | last = Lippincott-Schwartz  | first = Jennifer | title = Cell biology: Ripping up the nuclear envelope | journal = Nature | volume = 416 | issue = 6876 | pages = 31–32 | date = 2002-03-07 | doi =10.1038/416031a  | pmid = 11882878  [/tpl] Therefore the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase.[tpl]cite journal | author = Boulikas T | title = Phosphorylation of transcription factors and control of the cell cycle | journal = Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–77 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7549180[/tpl] Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.
However, in dinoflagellates, the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliates, sporozoans) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemle during cell division.
Apoptosis is a controlled process in which the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.[tpl]cite  journal  | author = Steen R, Collas P | title = Mistargeting of B-type lamins at the end of mitosis: implications on cell survival and regulation of lamins A/C expression | journal = J Cell Biol | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 621–626 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11331311 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.153.3.621  [/tpl]
The nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.

===Disease-related dynamics===

Initially, it has been suspected that immunoglobulins in general and autoantibodies in particular do not enter the nucleus. Now there is a body of evidence that under pathological conditions (e.g. lupus erythematosus) IgG can enter the nucleus.Böhm I. IgG deposits can be detected in cell nuclei of patients with both lupus erythematosus and malignancy. Clin Rheumatol 2007;26(11) 1877-1882
