==History==

The palace of Malia, dating from the Middle Bronze Age, was destroyed by an earthquake during the Late Bronze Age;Mallia archaeological site Knossos and other sites were also destroyed at that time. The palace was later rebuilt toward the end of the Late Bronze Age. Most of the ruins visible today date from this second period of construction. The palace features a giant central courtyard, 48m x 23m in size. On the south side are two sets of steps leading upwards and a maze of tiny rooms. Also here is a strange carved stone called a kernos stone, which looks like a millstone with a cup attached to the side of it. On the north side of the courtyard were storage rooms with giant earthenware pithos jars, up to two metres tall. These were used for holding grain, olive oil and other liquids; the floor of these rooms has a complex drainage system for carrying away spilled liquids.
The palace of Malia was discovered in 1915 by Hadzidakis, a Greek archaeologist. It was fully excavated from 1922 onwards by the French School at Athens in collaboration with Greek scholars. Importantly, the palace was surrounded by a Minoan town which has only recently been uncovered. Excavation is ongoing. Important parts of the old and new excavations are covered by a series of large semi-transparent roofs, which protect them from the elements. In places tourists are allowed to wander among the ruins; in others, walkways allow passage above. There are rooms which have been identified as metal workshops, ceramic workshops and meeting rooms; there is also a large residential dwelling with on-suite bath, which is similar to a design at Phaistos, both taking advantage of expansive views.C.

During the summer of 2008, Malia attracted increased attention from the British news media, centering on the wild nightlife and the antisocial behaviour attributed to this. Various newspapers and television news services such as BBC News and GMTV sent reporters to highlight the growing concern at the violence and alcohol problems in the popular resort.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1040733/Sex-drugs-booze-violence-Welcome-Malia-party-resort-serving-lethal-holiday-cocktail-young-Brits.html |title= Sex Drugs Booze Violence welcome To Malia|publisher=Daily Mail |accessdate=01/08/2008|location=London|first=Natalie|last=Clarke|date=1 August 2008[/tpl] This behaviour was also brought to light in the 2002 Sky 1 documentary titled Sex on the Beach which was filmed in Malia and followed the experiences of different groups of British holidaymakers during their stay with an emphasis on their drinking binges and sexual promiscuity. 
Malia was also the setting for 2011 British comedy film The Inbetweeners Movie, in which the four main characters went on a lads' holiday.
