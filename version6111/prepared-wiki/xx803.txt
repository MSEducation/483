[[List of country calling codes]]

CATEGORIES: Country codes, Telephone numbers, Communication-related lists, Telecommunications lists

This is a list of country calling codes or dial in code defined by ITU-T recommendations E.123 and E.164, also called IDD (International Direct Dialling) or ISD (International Subscriber Dialling) codes.
The dial plan of a telephone network usually designates a special trunk access prefix code, the international dialing prefix, which must be dialed before the country calling code to select access to the international circuits of the network. The prefix is specific to the country from which the caller is dialing, but often it is 00 or 011. Generally, a user must consult local directories for the access code if a number is listed beginning with a plus sign, which means the digits following it are a country calling code.

==Tree list==

Country calling codes are prefix codes; hence, they can be organized as a tree. In each row of the table below, the country codes given in the left-most column share the same first digit; then subsequent columns give the second digit in ascending order.

==Ordered by code==

While there is a general geographic grouping to the zones, many exceptions exist for political and historical reasons. Thus, the geographical indicators below are approximations only.

===Zone 1: North American Numbering Plan Area===

Countries within NANP (North American Numbering Plan) administered areas are assigned area codes as if they were all within one country. The codes below in format +1 XXX represent area code XXX within the +1 NANP zone – not a separate country code.
The North American Numbering Plan Area includes:

===Zone 2: mostly Africa===

(but also Aruba, Faroe Islands, Greenland and British Indian Ocean Territory)

===Zones 3-4: Europe===

Originally, larger countries such as the United Kingdom or France, were assigned two-digit codes to compensate for their usually longer domestic numbers. Small countries, such as Iceland, were assigned three-digit codes. Since the 1980s, all new assignments have been three-digit regardless of countries’ populations.

===Zone 5: mostly Latin America===

===Zone 6: Southeast Asia and Oceania===

===Zone 7: Former [tpl]URS[/tpl]===

===Zone 8: East Asia and special services===

===Zone 9: Central, South and Western Asia===
