Palladium hydride is metallic palladium that contains a substantial quantity of hydrogen within its crystal lattice.  Despite its name, it is not an ionic hydride but rather an alloy of palladium with metallic hydrogen.  At room temperature, palladium hydrides may contain two crystalline phases, α and β (sometimes called α'). Pure α phase exists at x  0.58; intermediate x values correspond to α-β mixtures.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02667685|title=The H-Pd (hydrogen-palladium) System|year=1994|last1=Manchester|first1=F.

Hydrogen absorption by palladium is reversible and therefore has been investigated for hydrogen storage.[tpl]cite journal | title = Thermal Decomposition of the Non-Interstitial Hydrides for the Storage and Production of Hydrogen | author = W.

A great number of research labs in the United States, Italy, Japan, Israel, Korea, China and elsewhere claim to have observed cold fusion in palladium deuteride (heavy hydrogen version of palladium hydride)[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl].

==History==

The absorption of hydrogen gas by palladium was first noted by T. Graham in 1866 and absorption of electrolytically produced hydrogen, where hydrogen was absorbed into a palladium cathode, was first documented in 1939. Graham produced an alloy with the composition PdH0.75.

==Chemical structure and properties==

The absorption of hydrogen produces two different phases, both of which contain palladium metal atoms in a face centered cubic (fcc, rocksalt) lattice, which is the same structure as pure palladium metal. At low concentrations up to PdH0.02 the palladium lattice expands slightly, from 3.889 Å to 3.895 Å. Above this concentration the second phase appears with a lattice constant of 4.025 Å. Both phases coexist until a composition of PdH0.58 when the alpha phase disappears. Neutron diffraction studies have shown that hydrogen atoms randomly occupy the octahedral interstices in the metal lattice (in an fcc lattice there is one octahedral hole per metal atom). The limit of absorption at normal pressures is PdH0.7, indicating that approximately 70% of the octahedral holes are occupied. The absorption of hydrogen is reversible, and hydrogen rapidly diffuses through the metal lattice. Metallic conductivity reduces as hydrogen is absorbed, until at around PdH0.5 the solid becomes a semiconductor.

===Superconductivity===

PdHx is a superconductor with a transition temperature Tc of about 9 K for x=1. (Pure palladium is not superconducting). Drops in resistivity vs. temperature curves were observed at higher temperatures (up to 273 K) in hydrogen-rich (x ~ 1), nonstoichiometric palladium hydride and interpreted as superconducting transitions.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Physica C |volume=388–389 |year=2003|pages=571–572 |url=http://www.heraphysics.it/PhysC388p571.pdf|title=Possibility of high temperature superconducting phases in PdH|doi=10.1016/S0921-4534(02)02745-4|last1=Tripodi|first1=P|bibcode = 2003PhyC..388..571T [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.physc.2004.02.099|title= Superconductivity in PdH: phenomenological explanation|year=2004|last1=Tripodi|first1=P|last2=Digioacchino|first2=D|last3=Vinko|first3=J|journal=Physica C: Superconductivity|volume=408-410|pages=350|bibcode = 2004PhyC..408..350T [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=A review of high temperature superconducting property of PdH system |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics B |volume=21 |issue=18&19 |year=2007 |pages=3343–3347  |doi=10.1142/S0217979207044524 |bibcode=2007IJMPB..21.3343T |last2=Di Gioacchino |first2=Daniele |last3=Vinko |first3=Jenny Darja |last1=Tripodi |first1=Paolo[/tpl] These results have been questioned[tpl]cite journal|title=Remarks on superconductivity in PdH|doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.07.082|url=http://144.206.159.178/FT/537/584536/12434643.pdf|year=2007|last1=Baranowski|first1=B.|last2=Dębowska|first2=L.|journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds|volume=437|pages=L4[/tpl] [tpl]not in reference|date=December 2013[/tpl] and have not been confirmed thus far.

===Surface absorption process===

The process of absorption of hydrogen has been shown by scanning tunnelling microscopy to require aggregates of at least three vacancies on the surface of the crystal to promote the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule.[tpl]cite journal|title=Dissociative hydrogen adsorption on palladium requires aggregates of three or more vacancies|author= T.

Salmeron|journal= Nature|year=2003|doi=10.1038/nature01557|volume=422|issue=6933|pages=705–7|pmid=12700757|bibcode = 2003Natur.422..705M [/tpl] The reason for such a behaviour and the particular structure of trimers has been analyzed.[tpl]cite journal|title=When Langmuir is too simple: H2 dissociation on Pd(111)|author= N.

==Uses==

The absorption of hydrogen is reversible and is highly selective. Industrially a palladium-based diffuser separator is used. Impure gas is passed through tubes of thin walled silver-palladium alloy. Protium and deuterium readily diffuse through the alloy membrane. The gas that comes through is pure and ready for use. Palladium is alloyed with silver to improve its strength. To ensure that the formation of the beta phase is avoided, as the lattice expansion noted earlier would cause distortions and splitting of the membrane, the temperature is maintained above 300 °C.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw|pages=1150–151[/tpl]
