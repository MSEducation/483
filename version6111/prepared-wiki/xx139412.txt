==History==

JD Squared, Inc. was originally founded under the name Hughes Performance Engineering in 1982. In 1983 they designed and released the Model 1 tube bender. The Model 1 Bender became popular because it was one of the few affordable manual tube benders on the fabricating market. However, the Model 1 Bender could only bend 90 degrees. In 1988 JD Squared released the Model 2 Tube bender with 180 degree bend capability. In 1992 the company changed its name to JD Squared, Inc. and released the Model 3 Tube Bender.
