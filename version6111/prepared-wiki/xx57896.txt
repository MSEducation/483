===Leaked memos===

In September 2003, a large number of internal Diebold memos, dating back to 1999, were posted to the BlackBoxVoting.org web site, resulting in the site being shut down due to a Diebold cease and desist order. Later, other website organizations Why War? and the Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons, a group of student activists at Swarthmore College posted the memos. U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich, a Democrat from Ohio, placed portions of the files on his websites."Kucinich Calls for Suspension of Electronic Voting," Common Dreams, April 23, 2004. The full set of these internal memos is posted here: Original Diebold Memos—FULL SET "Original Diebold Memos -- Full Set"
Diebold attempted to stop the publication of these internal memos by sending cease-and-desist letters to each site hosting these documents, demanding that they be removed. Diebold claimed the memos as their copyrighted material, and asserted that anyone who published the memos online was in violation of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act found in §512 of the United States Copyright Act.
When it turned out that some of the challenged groups would not back down, Diebold retracted their threat. Those who had been threatened by Diebold then sued for court costs and damages, in OPG v. Diebold. This suit eventually led to a victory for the plaintiffs against Diebold, when in October 2004 Judge Jeremy Fogel ruled that Diebold abused its copyrights in its efforts to suppress the embarrassing memos.

===Stephen Heller (whistleblower)===

In January and February 2004, a whistleblower named Stephen Heller brought to light memos from Jones Day, Diebold's attorneys, informing Diebold that they were in breach of California law by continuing to use illegal and uncertified software in California voting machines. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer filed civil and criminal suits against the company, which were dropped when Diebold settled out of court for $2.6 million. In February 2006, Heller was charged with three felonies for this action.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/18/local/me-heller18|title=Whistle-Blower or Thief in Diebold Case?|last=So |first=Hemmy |date=March 18, 2006|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-07-14[/tpl]E-vote case puts actor in limelight[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] On 20 November 2006  Heller made a plea agreement to pay $10,000 to Jones Day, write an apology, and receive three years probation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071128035035/http://da.co.la.ca.us/mr/112006b.htm |title=dead-link Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office statement regarding Stephen Heller's plea bargain |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-11-28 |accessdate=2011-11-22[/tpl]

===Diebold and Kenneth Blackwell's conflict of interest===

Ohio State Senator Jeff Jacobson, Republican, asked Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, also a Republican, in July, 2003 to disqualify Diebold's bid to supply voting machines for the state, after security problems were discovered in its software, but was refused.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0828-08.htm |title=Voting Machine Controversy |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=2003-08-28 |accessdate=2011-11-22[/tpl] Blackwell had ordered Diebold touch screen voting machines, reversing an earlier decision by the state to purchase only optical scan voting machines which, unlike the touch screen devices, would leave a "paper trail" for recount purposes. Blackwell was found in April 2006, to own 83 shares of Diebold stock, down from 178 shares purchased in January 2005, which he attributed to an unidentified financial manager at Credit Suisse First Boston who had violated his instructions to avoid potential conflict of interest, without his knowledge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2006/apr/04/improper-stock-buy-reported/ |title=Improper stock buy reported |publisher=Vindy.com |date=2006-04-04 |accessdate=2011-11-22[/tpl] When Cuyahoga county's primary was held on May 2, 2006, officials ordered the hand-counting of more than 18,000 paper ballots after Diebold's new optical scan machines produced inconsistent tabulations, leaving several local races in limbo for days and eventually resulting in a reversal of the outcome of one race for state representative. Blackwell ordered an investigation by the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections; Ohio Democrats demanded that Blackwell, who was also the Republican gubernatorial candidate in 2006, recuse himself from the investigation due to conflicts of interest, but Blackwell did not do so.Democrats want Blackwell to remove himself from election probe Canton Repository, 9 May 2006
The Republican head of the Franklin County, Ohio Board of Elections, Matt Damschroder, said a Diebold contractor came to him and bragged of a $50,000 check he had written to Blackwell’s "political interests."Vendor’s donation questioned Columbus Dispatch, July 16, 2005

==Name Change and Acquisition by Election Systems & Software==

In 2006, Diebold removed its name from the voting machinesand in August 2007 changed its name to "Premier Election Solutions" ("PES").
Election Systems & Software (ES&S) acquired Premier Election Solutions on September 3, 2009. ES&S President and CEO Aldo Tesi said combining the two companies will result in better products and services for customers and voters. The sale did not affect the Brazilian division.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20090903/MONEY/909039985|title=ES&S buys competitor|publisher=Omaha World-Herald (Omaha.com)|accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl]
The United States Department of Justice objected to the acquisition on anti-trust grounds.
