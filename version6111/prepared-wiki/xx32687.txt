==History==

The county was formed from parts of Maricopa County and Pinal County on February 8, 1881.http://cip.azlibrary.gov/Collection.aspx?CollID=1170 The boundary was then extended eastward to the San Carlos River by public petition in 1889. The original county seat was in the mining community of Globe City, now Globe, Arizona.
Popular theory says that the word Gila was derived from a Spanish contraction of Hah-quah-sa-eel, a Yuma word meaning "running water which is salty".[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060111100317/http://www2.srs.fs.fed.us/r3/gila/about/|title=Gila National Forest (archived)|publisher=United States Forest Service|date=2003-12-04|accessdate=2007-10-16[/tpl] 
In the 1880s, a long range war broke out in Gila County that became the most costly feud in American history, resulting in an almost complete annihilation of the families involved.  The Pleasant Valley War (also sometimes called the Tonto Basin Feud or Tonto Basin War) matched the cattle-herding Grahams against the sheep-herding Tewksburys. Once partisan feelings became tense and hostilities began, Frederick Russell Burnham, who later became a celebrated scout and the inspiration for the boy scouts, was drawn into the conflict on the losing side.[tpl]cite book | last =Forrest| first =Earle R. | coauthors = | title =Arizona's Dark and Bloody Ground; an authentic account of the sanguinary Pleasant Valley vendetta that swept through Arizona's cattleland in the latter eighteen eighties--the Graham-Tewksbury feud | publisher =Caxton Printers, Ltd | year =1936 | location =Caldwell, Idaho | pages = 15, 292 | oclc = 1825248  [/tpl][tpl]cite book | last =Burnham | first =Frederick Russell | coauthors = | title =Scouting on Two Continents | publisher =Doubleday, Page & company | year =1926 | location = | pages = 2; Chapters 3 & 4 | oclc = 407686  [/tpl] Burnham shot many men in the feud, and was himself nearly killed by a bounty hunter.[tpl]cite book |last=Lott | first=Jack |editor-first=Craig | editor-last=Boddington |title=America -- The Men and Their Guns That Made Her Great |publisher=Petersen Publishing Co. |year=1981 |page=90 |chapter=Chapter 8.

In the 1960s, it was home of Gerald Gault, who was the subject of the
1967 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, in re Gault, that stated juveniles have the same rights as adults when arrested to be notified of the charges against them, the rights to attorneys and to confront their accusers.
