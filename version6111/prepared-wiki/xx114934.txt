[[Astle]]

CATEGORIES: English-language surnames, Patronymic surnames

Astle is an English surname of multiple origins. In the East Midlands, the surname is certainly of patronymic origin. This is also a possibility in Cheshire yet the name there more probably originated as a locative surname.

==Origin in the East Midlands==

The surname Astle first originated in Mercia, England. In the East Midlands, the name was derived from the Danish name Asketil which in turn derives from the Old Norse words áss meaning a god, and ketil meaning cauldron or kettle. References to the Viking 'Asketil' have been found in 12th century surveys by the Monks of Burton Abbey. They record how in 874, King Asketil and three other kings sacked Repton, then the capital of Mercia, after sailing up the River Trent. (This was during the campaign of King Ceolwulf II and the Great Heathen Army to overthrow King Burgred.) The four kings were allocated lands in a partitioned Mercia corresponding to the modern shires of Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby and Leicester. To this day, the largest grouping of Astle families is still concentrated in a relatively small area of South Derbyshire and East Staffordshire, close to the River Trent.

==Origin in Cheshire==

While the spelling 'Astles' prevails in Cheshire, the regular spelling of 'Astle' is also common. However, its origin in this area may be distinct. As the Danes occupied Cheshire via the west coast, it is possible that other men named 'Asketil' lent their name to the people of the region. However it is more likely that the name is this area derives from the hamlet of Astle (previously Asthull). If this is the case, the name would be a contraction of 'east hill'. Thus it is a locative surname.

==Historical Occurrences==

The first recorded spelling of any variant of the family name dates to circa 1225 during the reign of King Henry III when the 'Episcopal Records of Lichfield', Staffordshire, make mention of 'Simon de Astell'.
The evolution of the name can be observed in the register of the Black Prince’s administration (1346–1365) where it records that:
'In 1365, one Robert Astel of Hazelbech, Northants, asked the Black Prince to confirm his rightful ownership of one of his lands in Hazelbech. He produced a document providing that the land had been given to 'William son of Asketil of Hazelbech and his heirs'.'
Robert Astel was of course one of these heirs.
A 'Register of the Freemen of the City of York' dating from 1349 includes 'Richard de Asthul'.

==Coat of arms==

The shield of the Astle coat of arms is 'gules' (red) symbolising martyrdom, military strength or warriors. It contains a white 'cross' in each corner, indicating that the family engaged in the Crusades. At its centre is a 'lion passant', the upper body of which is 'or' (gold), according to the common English tradition, while the colouring of its lower body may signify the Danish origin of the family.

==Motto==

The Astle family motto is 'Sub cruce glorior' ('The glory of the Cross').
