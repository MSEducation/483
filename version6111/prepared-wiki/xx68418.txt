Amongst these were "My Man Rocks Me (With One Steady Roll)" (1922),Song: "My Man Rocks Me (With One Steady Roll)" written by J. Berni Barbour, of historic interest as the first secular recording to reference the phrase "rock and roll".Altschule, Glenn C.

Also in 1922, Trixie Smith won first place and a silver cup in a blues singing contest at the Inter-Manhattan Casino in New York, sponsored by dancer Irene Castle, with her song "Trixie's Blues," singing against Alice Leslie Carter, Daisy Martin and Lucille Hegamin.Oliver, Paul. The Story of the Blues, UPNE, page 77 - ISBN 1-55553-354-X She is most remembered for "Railroad Blues" (1925), a song that featured one of Smith's most inspired vocal performances on record, and "The World Is Jazz Crazy and So Am I" (1925). Both songs feature Louis Armstrong on cornet. She was a highly polished performer, and her records include several outstanding examples of the blues on which she is accompanied by artists such as James P. Johnson, and Freddie Keppard.Larkin, Colin.
