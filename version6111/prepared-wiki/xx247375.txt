In 2010, Woodson succeeded Interim Chancellor James H. Woodward to become the fourteenth chancellor of North Carolina State University, the largest university in North Carolina. One of Woodson’s first acts at NC State was to initiate the formulation of a ten-year strategic plan for the university. The result – The Pathway to the Future: NC State’s 2011-2020 Strategic Plan – is the framework that guides university administrators in long- and short-term decision making. It was approved by the NC State Board of Trustees on April 22, 2011.
As part of this plan, Woodson led efforts to expand interdisciplinary research at NC State through programs such as the Chancellor’s Faculty Excellence Program, which centers on hiring clusters of faculty to collaborate in addressing global challenges from different perspectives, and the University Faculty Scholars program, which recognizes the university’s leaders in academics and research.
Under Woodson, NC State received the two largest gifts in its history. In 2010, Lonnie C. Poole Jr. and his wife, Carol Johnson Poole, gave the university $40 million, which increased NC State’s endowment by 10 percent. The majority of the gift was designated for what is now the Poole College of Management. Support was also designated for the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and for the construction of a clubhouse at NC State’s golf course on Centennial Campus.http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/12/17/867027/transformative-gift-for-ncsu.html In 2013, the Park Foundation donated $50 million to begin an endowment that will provide permanent funding for the university's existing Park Scholarships program.http://www.ncsu.edu/features/2013/09/park-promise/
