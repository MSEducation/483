This is a list of current heads of United Kingdom Missions abroad.

==Resident heads of mission==

==Non-resident heads of mission==

The United Kingdom does not maintain a full embassy or High Commission in a number of countries. In each of these cases the head of mission to another country, usually a neighbouring one, is concurrently accredited to the other country (except in the cases of the ambassadors to Nicaragua and Somalia, who are dedicated but currently non-resident). In most cases, a smaller, local mission provides for emergencies, and is headed up by a lesser diplomat or a member of the local British community.
