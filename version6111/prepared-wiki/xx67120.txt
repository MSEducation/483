Middlesbrough Football Club [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɪ|d|əl|z|b|r|ə[/tpl], also known as  Boro, are an English football club based in Middlesbrough, who play in the Football League Championship. Formed in 1876, they have played at the Riverside Stadium since August 1995,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/boro-fc/boro-club-info/|title=Boro FC club info|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070904115147/http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/boro-fc/boro-club-info/|archivedate=4 September 2007|publisher=gazettelive.co.uk|accessdate=27 May 2008[/tpl] their third ground since turning professional in 1889. Their longest-serving home was Ayresome Park, where they played for 92 years, from 1903 to 1995.
They were one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992. The club's main rivals are Sunderland and Newcastle United, however the club also takes part in Yorkshire derbies with several other Yorkshire clubs; most notably Leeds United.
The club's highest league finish to date was third in the 1913–14 season and they have only spent two seasons outside of the Football League's top two divisions. The club came close to folding in 1986 after experiencing severe financial difficulties before the club was saved by a consortium led by then board member and later chairman Steve Gibson. Middlesbrough were controversially deducted three points for failing to fulfil a fixture against Blackburn Rovers during the 1996–97 Premier League season and were subsequently relegated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/content/premierleague/en-gb/matchday/results.html?paramSeason=1996-1997&view=.dateSeason |title=Season 1996/97|accessdate=27 May 2008 |publisher=Premier League[/tpl] They were promoted the following season and spent eleven consecutive seasons in the top division before relegation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/middlesbrough |title=Middlesbrough, Official Site of the Premier League|accessdate=14 February 2014 |publisher=Premier League[/tpl] Middlesbrough won the League Cup in 2004, the club's first and only major trophy. They reached the 2006 UEFA Cup Final in May 2006 but were beaten by Spanish side Sevilla. On 24 May 2009, Middlesbrough were relegated to the Championship, failing to extend their 11-year stay in the Premier League.[ref]

==History==

They won the FA Amateur Cup in 1895 and again in 1898. The club turned professional in 1889, but reverted to amateur status in 1892.[tpl]cite book|last=Glasper|first=Harry|title=Middlesbrough A Complete Record 1876–1989|publisher=Breedon Books Sport|isbn=0-907969-53-4[/tpl] They turned professional permanently in 1899.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/club/club-history/0,,1~51936,00.html |title=Club History – Birth of The Boro: 1876–1902 |accessdate=14 February 2014 |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C. [/tpl] After three seasons, they won promotion to the First Division, where they would remain for the next [tpl]nowrap|22 years[/tpl].
In 1903, the club moved to Ayresome Park, their home for the next [tpl]nowrap|92 years[/tpl]. In 1905, the club sanctioned the transfer of Alf Common for £1,000, a record fee.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/battling-boro-125-years-3842065 |title=Battling with the Boro for 125 years |work=Evening Gazette |date=21 October 2003 |accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl] Over the next few years, their form fluctuated greatly, rising to sixth in 1907–08 before dropping to seventeenth two seasons later. The club rose to their highest league finish to date, third, in 1913–14.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/club/club-history/0,,1~352488,00.html |title=Club History – Early Years: 1903-World War II |accessdate=14 February 2014 |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C. [/tpl] The First World War soon intervened and football was suspended.
In 2012 Boro went on to win the league
Before league football resumed, Middlesbrough won the Northern Victory League, but the team were unable to maintain their previous form and finished the 1919–20 season in mid-table. They remained in the First Division for the next few seasons, but were relegated in 1923–24 after finishing bottom, ten points adrift of their nearest rivals.[ref]
[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.middlesbrough-mad.co.uk/league_history/middlesbrough/index.shtml |title=League history |publisher=Middlesbrough Mad |accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl][/ref] Three seasons later, they won the Division Two title. During that season, debutant George Camsell, who had signed from Third Division North side Durham City the previous season, finished with a record 59 league goals, which included nine hat tricks. He would continue as top scorer for each of the next ten seasons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/boro-fc/boro-legends/2007/07/27/george-camsell-84229-19531247/ |title=George Camsell |publisher=gazettelive.co.uk |accessdate=26 May 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071103124051/http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/boro-fc/boro-legends/2007/07/27/george-camsell-84229-19531247/ |archivedate = 3 November 2007[/tpl] Their tenure back in the top flight lasted only one season, and the club were relegated. They were promoted at the first attempt in 1928–29, winning another Second Division title. The club remained in the First Division until 1954.
The decade before the war saw the emergence of Wilf Mannion and George Hardwick, both of whom would go on to become England internationals in the years ahead. Middlesbrough climbed to fourth in the last full season before the Second World War and were expected to challenge for the title next season, but the war intervened. After the war, the club was unable to recover the form of the previous seasons and hovered around mid-table and exited in the early rounds of the FA Cup. Soon afterwards the team began to falter, eventually suffering relegation in 1953–54. This was the start of a 20-year spell outside the top division, but saw the emergence of one of the club's top goalscorers, Brian Clough, who scored 204 goals in 222 games, before he left for Sunderland.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/sep/21/guardianobituaries.football |title=Obituary: Brian Clough |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=26 May 2008  | first=Brian | last=Glanville | date=20 September 2004[/tpl] Over that period, Middlesbrough maintained reasonable progress in the Second Division but were never serious contenders for promotion. After a fourth place finish in 1962–63, the club endured a steady decline and were relegated to the Third Division for the first time in their history in 1966.
New manager Stan Anderson returned the club to the second flight at the first attempt. Middlesbrough would not finish below ninth during the next eight seasons. By 1974, Jack Charlton had taken over as manager and guided the team back to the top flight. They ensured promotion as early as 23 March, and with eight games of the season left, they became runaway champions, finishing with a record 65 points.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/club/club-history/0,,1~352495,00.html |title=Club History – Mannion, Hardwick, Clough and Charlton: 1945 to 1986 |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C. |accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl] Middlesbrough won their first silverware as a professional side in the 1975–76 season, lifting the Anglo-Scottish Cup in its inaugural season after a two-legged final win over Fulham.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/anglo-scottish-cup/1975-1976/results/fn |title=Anglo-Scottish Cup 1975-1976 : Final |publisher=Statto |accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl]
The club experienced severe financial difficulties during the mid-1980s. Middlesbrough were dropping down the table, and finished nineteenth in the 1984–85 season. In April 1986 the club had to borrow £30,000 from the PFA to pay wages. The final game of the season saw Middlesbrough relegated to the Third Division once more. That summer, the club called in the Provisional Liquidator and shortly afterwards, the club was wound up and the gates to Ayresome Park were padlocked. Without the £350,000 capital required for Football League registration, a new rule, it seemed inevitable that the club would fold permanently.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/just-37-days-save-club-3773580 |title=Just 37 days to save our club |accessdate=14 February 2014 |publisher=gazettelive.co.uk[/tpl] However, Steve Gibson, a member of the board at the time, brought together a consortium and with ten minutes to spare before the deadline, they completed their registration with the Football League for the 1986–87 season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/middlesbrough/4976108.stm |title=Uefa final caps Boro fairytale |accessdate=25 May 2008 |publisher=BBC | date=14 February 2014[/tpl] Following the registration came both a change of club crest and a change of the official company name to Middlesbrough Football and Athletic Club (1986) Ltd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/club/club-history/0,,1~352502,00.html |title=Club History – Winners at Last! 1986 to present |accessdate=14 February 2014 |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C.[/tpl]
Over the next two seasons, Middlesbrough gained successive promotions into Division Two and then into Division One. The next season though, they came straight back down to Division Two, and with it came the then British transfer record move of Gary Pallister to Manchester United for £2.3 million.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A18740513 |title=Manchester United: The Sir Alex Era – Part 1 |accessdate=28 May 2007 |publisher=BBC [/tpl] Despite constant promotion and relegation, Middlesbrough were founding members of the FA Premier League for the 1992–93 season.
Player-manager Bryan Robson, from Manchester United, took charge in 1994 and Middlesbrough were brought back into national attention.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/middlesbrough-fc-anthony-vickers-countdown-4043321 |title=Anthony Vickers' countdown of Boro's top 40 signings |accessdate=14 February 2014 |publisher=Gazette Live [/tpl] Following promotion to the Premier League and high-profile purchases like diminutive Brazilian Juninho, many considered Middlesbrough were on the way up. However, a difficult 1996–97 season was compounded by a deduction of three points imposed just after Christmas, as punishment for the club's failure to fulfil a fixture against Blackburn, which ultimately resulted in relegation. Without the points deduction, the club would have had enough points to avoid relegation. At the same time, the club managed to reach both the League and FA Cup finals for the first time, but lost out in both. Despite being in the second tier they were again runners up in the League Cup final the next year.
Despite losing high profile players Fabrizio Ravanelli and Juninho due to relegation, Middlesbrough were promoted back to the Premiership at the first attempt in 1998. The following season saw them settle well and they enjoyed a 12-game unbeaten run midway through 1998–99, including a 3–2 win at Old Trafford in January during which they took a 3–0 lead. It was United's only home defeat during their treble winning season. They continued to stay secure in mid-table the following season, thanks mainly to the goals of Hamilton Ricard and the signings of big name players such as Paul Ince and Christian Ziege. In 2000–01 they had a brief relegation scare that was solved with the arrival of Terry Venables as co-manager, and a 3–0 win away at Arsenal in March was the team's best result. The trend of buying European stars continued with the acquisitions of Christian Karembeu and Alen Bokšić.
Bryan Robson left the club before the start of 2001–02 season, having served as manager for 7 years, and was replaced by Manchester United assistant coach Steve McClaren. The following seasons saw Premiership security maintained as Middlesbrough slowly improved and were seen as a tough side to beat when playing at the Riverside Stadium. During McClaren's reign, Middlesbrough achieved their highest Premier league placing of 7th in the 2004-05 season.
The 2003–04 season was the most successful in the club's history as they finally won a major trophy after beating Bolton 2–1 in the League Cup final under manager Steve McClaren.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/3507795.stm |title=Boro lift Carling Cup |accessdate=21 May 2007 |date=29 February 2004 |publisher=BBC Sport [/tpl] This success also ensured that Middlesbrough would qualify for Europe – the UEFA Cup – for the first time, in which they reached the last 16. UEFA cup qualification was achieved for the second consecutive year after a dramatic 1–1 away draw with Manchester City thanks to a late penalty save from Mark Schwarzer in the last game of the season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2359695/City-pay-the-penalty-for-Fowler-miss.html|title=City pay the penalty for Fowler miss|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=14 February 2014  | first=Tim | last=Rich | date=16 May 2005[/tpl]

He oversaw the club reaching the quarter finals of the FA Cup for three seasons, but the club was relegated to the Football League Championship on the last day of the 2008–09 season. Southgate was sacked in October 2009, and replaced by Gordon Strachan. At the time of Southgate's dismissal, Boro were fourth in the Championship and only one point away from the automatic promotion spot,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/middlesbrough/2009-2010/table/2009-10-21|title=Middlesbrough 2009-2010 : English League Championship Table on 21 October 2009|accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl] but their form under Strachan was significantly worse and they finished mid-table.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/middlesbrough/2009-2010/table|title=Middlesbrough 2009-2010 : English League Championship Table at end of season|accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl]
Despite starting the 2010–11 campaign as promotion favourites, the club endured a disappointing start to the season securing only 1-point in 5 away games. Having slipped to 20th in the Championship following a home defeat to rivals Leeds, Strachan resigned on 18 October. A week later, Tony Mowbray was confirmed as the new manager.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/middlesbrough/9128153.stm |title=Middlesbrough name Tony Mowbray as new manager |accessdate=18 March 2012 |date=26 October 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport [/tpl]  Having staved off the threat of relegation, Mowbray successfully transformed Boro's fortunes, eventually guiding them to a top-half finish. Boro ended the season top of the form table after four consecutive league wins, the first such run since 1998. However, despite a magnificent first half of the season, Boro failed to capitalise, and finished 7th in the League, missing out on the play-offs by 5 points and 1 position.
Following a poor run of form of 2 wins in 12 games in the 2013–14 campaign, on 21 October 2013, nearly 3 years after his arrival, Tony Mowbray left the club with immediate effect.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~3505015,00.html |title=Middlesbrough | Tony Mowbray Leaves Boro |publisher=Mfc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=8 December 2013[/tpl] Aitor Karanka, a former Spanish defender and assistant coach at Real Madrid became the new Middlesbrough manager on 13 November 2013, signing a two-year contract.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24925713 |title= Aitor Karanka: Middlesbrough name ex-Real Madrid man as boss |work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013[/tpl] He became the first non-British manager at the club.

==Colours and crest==

Middlesbrough's original home kit upon election to the Football League in 1899 was a white home shirt with blue shorts and they did not adopt their colours of red and white until later that season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Middlesbrough/Middlesbrough.htm|title=Middlesbrough|publisher=Historical Football Kits|accessdate=21 May 2008[/tpl] Previous kits included a white shirt with a blue and white polka dotted collar from around 1889. The Middlesbrough kit has remained broadly the same over the years with a red shirt and socks and either red or white shorts. The distinctive broad white stripe across the chest was introduced by Jack Charlton in 1973 (following an attempt to change the home shirt to a Leeds United-style white shirt) and brought back for a one-off in 1997–98 and then again for the 2000–01 and 2004–05 seasons due to popular demand.[tpl]cite news|date=30 December 2007|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~1201014,00.html|title=Take Part in Boro's Battle of the Band|publisher=Middlesbrough F.C.|accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl] The club subsequently announced in December 2007 that the club would allow the fans to decide via an online and text vote whether the white band should return for the following season. On 8 January 2008 the club announced that the white band was to return, with 77.4% of voters voting in its favour, with the fans to choose the final shirt design from a selection of three designs,[tpl]cite news|date=8 January 2008|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~1209302,00.html|title=We're Backing The Band|publisher=Middlesbrough F.C.|accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl] of which the winner was announced on 7 May 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~1307364,00.html |title=The Band Is Back! |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C. |date=7 May 2008 |accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl]
The Middlesbrough crest has gone through four changes since the formation of the club. Initially, the badge was simply the town of Middlesbrough's crest with a red lion instead of a blue lion in order to fit in with the club's colours. Following the adoption of the white band on the shirts in 1973, only the red lion remained with the letters "M.F.C" underneath in red. This was further adapted following the reformation of the club in 1986 to a circular crest with the lion in the middle and the words "Middlesbrough Football Club 1986" around the circle in order to reflect this new era. In 2007, Middlesbrough changed their crest once again, this time with the lion inside a shield and the words "Middlesbrough Football Club 1876" underneath. The club stated that this was to reflect the club's long history and not just their post-liquidation status.
Since the 2009–10 season, Middlesbrough's kit has been produced by adidas, replacing the previous deal with Errea which had lasted for 15 years.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/errea-dropped-favour-global-brand-3719674| title= Errea dropped in favour of global brand adidas | work=Evening Gazette | date=31 March 2009 | accessdate=14 February 2014 [/tpl] The kit is only available in the UK from the official club shops and Middlesbrough's online store.[tpl]cite news | date=23 December 2005 | url=http://www.comeonboro.com/interviews/140006.htm | title=DAVE ALLAN INTERVIEW 23–12–05 | publisher=ComeOnBoro.com | accessdate=22 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070407170032/http://www.comeonboro.com/interviews/140006.htm |archivedate = 7 April 2007[/tpl] The club's shirt sponsor was announced on 20 July 2007 as satellite navigation device manufacturers Garmin.[tpl]cite news | date=28 June 2007 | url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~1063181,00.html | title=Boro Sponsorship Talks Ongoing |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C. | accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|date = 20 July 2007|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~1076097,00.html |title=Boro Announce New Sponsor|publisher="mfc.co.uk"|accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl] This contract was extended until the end of the 2008–09 season in a deal described as "the biggest in the club's history".[tpl]cite news | date=18 January 2008 | url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/boros-biggest-shirt-signing-history-3736492| title=Boro's Biggest Shirt Signing in History| publisher=eveninggazettelive.co.uk | accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl]

==Stadium==

After formation in 1876, and with the club still amateurs, Middlesbrough's first two years of football were played at Albert Park in Middlesbrough. After seeing the damage being caused by players and supporters, the Park Committee ordered the club to find an alternate venue. The club moved to Breckon Hill, behind the present-day Middlesbrough College, after agreeing to rent the land from its owner. However, two years later in 1880, the owner increased the rent and the club decided to move. They moved into the Linthorpe Road Ground in 1882, home at the time of Middlesbrough Cricket Club. The cricket club departed in 1893–94 to move to the Breckon Hill field, and Middlesbrough Football Club became sole users of the ground.
With the club's growing size, and entry to the Football League, they had to move to a new ground in 1903, Ayresome Park. It was designed by Archibald Leitch and would be the club's home for the next 92 years. Following the Taylor Report in 1990, the ground either needed modernising or the club needed a new stadium. The club decided on the latter, and moved out at the end of the 1994–95 season. It was used as a training ground during 1995–96, before it was demolished in 1997 and a housing estate built in its place.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/club/grounds |title=Road to the Riverside |accessdate=14 February 2014 |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C.[/tpl] The club now trains at a £7 million complex at Rockliffe Park, in Hurworth, on the outskirts of Darlington.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/club/rockliffe-park |title=Rockliffe Park |accessdate=14 February 2014 |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C.[/tpl]
The Riverside Stadium, named by the supporters of the club after a vote, became the club's home in 1995. It was the first stadium to be built in line with the Taylor Report's recommendations on all-seater stadia for clubs in the top two divisions of the English football league system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/club/stadium-story|title=The Riverside Stadium |accessdate=14 February 2014 |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C.[/tpl] It was originally a 30,000 seater stadium, constructed at a cost of £16 million, before it was expanded in 1998 to a capacity of 35,100 for an extra £5 million.
The capacity of the stadium has since been reduced slightly to its current level of 34,988.
Average attendances at Middlesbrough matches have fluctuated over the past several years, moving from a 2004–05 high average of 32,012 to a low of 26,092 in 2006–07, then up again to 28,428 in 2008–09. Following relegation to the Championship attendances have dipped, although the crowd of 23,451 which saw Middlesbrough's first Championship game against Sheffield United represents far higher gates than is usual for the division, and indeed larger than those of some Premier League clubs, for example Queens Park Rangers or Wigan Athletic.
A reorganization of the Riverside Stadium occurred at the start of the 2013–14 season. Away fans were moved from behind the goal at the South Stand to the East Stand whilst home fans can now sit behind the goal in an attempt to create a bigger atmosphere at the stadium.

==Supporters==

Traditionally supporters come from Middlesbrough itself and towns in the immediate area. Middlesbrough have one of the highest proportions in Britain of locally born season ticket holders at 80%, and one of the highest proportions of female fans at 20%.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1350453.stm |title=Football's Rich Pickings |accessdate=23 May 2007 |publisher=BBC  | date=25 May 2001[/tpl] A survey at the start of the 2007–08 season found Middlesbrough supporters were the seventh loudest set of fans in the Premier League.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/26102007/58/premier-league-noise-league-table-sunderland-top.html |title=Premier League – Noise League Table |publisher=Yahoo!

The largest supporters' clubs include the Official Supporters' Club, the Middlesbrough Disabled Supporters' Association, Yarm Reds, Red Faction and Middlesbrough Supporters South.
Middlesbrough supporters' main rivals are Sunderland (with whom they contest the Tees–Wear derby), Newcastle United (with whom they contest the Tyne–Tees derby), and Leeds United, a fact confirmed by planetfootball.com's 2004 survey,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.footballfanscensus.com/issueresults/Club_Rivalries_Uncovered_Results.pdf |title=Club rivalries uncovered |publisher=footballfancensus |format=PDF |accessdate=13 October 2007[/tpl] where Sunderland and Newcastle fans also considered Middlesbrough to be amongst their top three rivalries. Carlisle United see Middlesbrough as their biggest rivals, but Middlesbrough supporters have not reciprocated, as they do not see Carlisle as a top three rival.
The nickname Smoggies was first used as a derogatory term by opposing supporters;[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2822465.stm |title=Football club bans gas masks |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=26 May 2008 | date=5 March 2003[/tpl] it relates to the industrial air pollution (smog) that used to hang over the town, but it was later used by Middlesbrough fans in a somewhat self-deprecating manner before finally being adopted as a badge of pride by supporters of the club. An example of this can be seen on the banners carried to away games stating "Smoggies on Tour".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/fans/flags-and-banners/0,,1~618925,00.html |title=Banners |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C. |accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl] Middlesbrough fans were notably praised by UEFA Chief Executive Lars-Christer Olsson after their behaviour during the 2005–06 UEFA Cup campaign.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/7164139._Impeccable__Boro_fans_win_praise/ |title='Impeccable' Boro fans win praise |date=20 May 2006 |accessdate=14 February 2014 |work=Northern Echo[/tpl] He commended that:[tpl]quote|You have the satisfaction of knowing that, although your team did not win the game, your supporters present in Eindhoven proved to the world that football fans can turn a match into a friendly, violence-free celebration.[/tpl] Middlesbrough fans had also been praised by Cleveland Police for their behaviour in previous rounds, particularly in the light of aggravation prior to and during the match at Roma.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/4812092.stm |title=Boro fans praised for behaviour |date=16 March 2006 |accessdate=31 August 2007 |publisher=BBC News [/tpl]

==Media relations==

Middlesbrough were the first football club in the world to launch its own TV channel – "Boro TV". The first broadcasts were tied to the club's first ever major cup final appearance in 1997, a full year ahead of Manchester United's MUTV, which still claims to be the first in the world. The channel was the brainchild of then NTL Markeking Director, Peter Wilcock. Its programmes were not 'live' initially but were pre-recorded and hosted by local radio/TV broadcaster & Boro fan, Dave Roberts. Boro TV went on to claim another 'first' when in August 2001 it become the first English football club to broadcast time-delayed full-match footage of their league games on their own channel.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/100145/boro-first-to-take-advantage-of-new-tv-rights-regulations |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120817200017/http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/100145/boro-first-to-take-advantage-of-new-tv-rights-regulations |archivedate=17 August 2012 |title=Boro first to take advantage of new TV rights regulations |accessdate=31 August 2007 |date=31 August 2001 |publisher=sportbusiness.com[/tpl] Boro TV ran through NTL cable television until July 2005.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/middlesbrough/4641295.stm |title=Boro television channel to close |date=1 July 2005 |accessdate=31 August 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport [/tpl] The club now show match highlights through a subscription-based scheme on their official website.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mfc.co.uk |title=Official website |publisher=Middlesbrough FC|accessdate=31 August 2007[/tpl]

In 2009, steel producer Corus Group announced the possibility that it would mothball its Teesside plant, with up to 4,000 employees and contractors facing redundancy, after a consortium of steel magnates walked away from a 10-year deal. Middlesbrough Football Club helped with the "Save Our Steel" campaign by hosting dozens of steel workers and their families as they marched around the ground, promoted the campaign via the stadium's PA system, scoreboards and in match day programmes, while players wore t-shirts during warm-ups promoting the campaign. Chairman Steve Gibson said:
[tpl]quote|"Middlesbrough Football Club exists for the community, for the people of Teesside—and the closure of the steel plants threatens to rip the heart out of our community. We cannot stand by and allow that to happen. We want the steelworkers and their families to know that we are behind them and will help their campaign in any way we can ... We like to think that the football club is the flagship of Teesside. Well this is our town and these are our people and we have to do what we can to help them."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~1798024,00.html |title=Boro's Steel Fight Goes On |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C. |date=16 September 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl][/tpl]
