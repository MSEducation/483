The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company was a life insurance company based in Newark, New Jersey that was chartered in 1845. The company was headed by Frederick Frelinghuysen (1848â€“1924).[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Frederick Frelinghuysen. Ex-President of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company Dies. |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B1EF73A59177A93C0A9178AD85F408285F9 |work= |publisher=New York Times |date=January 2, 1924|accessdate=2007-05-30 [/tpl]International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 3. St. James Press, 1991  The company was known as the "Tiffany" of insurance companies, a reference to its reputation as the life insurance company to the upper classes.
Mutual Benefit Life was taken into receivership for rehabilitation by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance on July 16, 1991 after losses in an overheated real estate market led to a run by policyholders.  As with all life insurance carrier liabilities, the policy cash values and death benefits were taken over by stronger and larger carriers in the U.S. and all policyholders were kept whole.
The following was posted to the New Jersey commissioner's website: Inquiry to Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company
This will respond to inquiries regarding policies originally issued by The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company .
Mutual Benefit was placed in rehabilitation under the supervision of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance on July 16, 1991. Mutual Benefit's in-force policies were transferred to MBL Life Assurance Corporation ("MBL Life"), effective May 1, 1994. Mutual Benefit was ultimately liquidated and dissolved, effective June 14, 2001.
Subsequent to 1994, all former Mutual Benefit policies were administered by MBL Life pursuant to a Plan of Rehabilitation approved by the Superior Court of New Jersey (the "Court"). In 1998, MBL Life entered into various transactions under which policy liabilities were transferred to other insurers. Each transaction was duly approved by the Court and filed with governing State Insurance Departments. Ultimately, an Order For Liquidation of MBL Life was entered, effective January 12, 2000. An Order For Dissolution was ordered by the court on October 22, 2004.
If the policy referenced in the inquiry was in force at the time of the applicable 1998 transaction, it was automatically transferred to one of the following insurers (depending on the type of policy):
Individual Life Insurance Contracts:
AIG SunAmerica Life Assurance Company (formerly, Anchor National Life
Insurance Company) (Non-New York State Policyholders)
First SunAmerica Life Insurance Company (New York State Policyholders)
c/o Liberty Insurance Services
Telephone: 800-821-7887
Individual Annuity Contracts:
AIG SunAmerica Life Assurance Company (formerly, Anchor National Life
Insurance Company) (Non-New York State Policyholders)
First SunAmerica Life Insurance Company (New York State Policyholders)
c/o AIG Annuity
Telephone: 888-333-2349
Group Annuity (Pension) Contracts:
c/o SunAmerica Financial Services
Telephone: 888-502-0600
Disability Insurance Contracts:
Reassure America Life Insurance Company (Non-New York State Policyholders)
Life Reassurance Corporation of America (New York State Policyholders)
c/o Insurance Servicing Center
Telephone: 800-743-0122
Please contact the applicable insurer for a response to the inquiry. (With regard to Group Annuity Contracts, participants inquiring about contracts issued under a pension plan may also seek additional information from either the Company personnel department or the Plan Administrator.)
If the policy or contract was not in force on the date of the applicable transaction, either (i) it had lapsed, (ii) it was surrendered for value, (iii) the proceeds had been previously distributed pursuant to the terms of the policy or (iv) the proceeds had been transferred to another insurer at the election of the contractholder. If any of these listed events occurred, the policy has terminated and there are no available records which will provide additional information.
In addition, a small number of active policies (e.g. Variable Annuity and 401(k) Contracts) were not transferred to the above-listed insurers and, pursuant to an Order entered by the Court, were either (i) terminated with the cash value paid to the contractholder or (ii) replaced by another insurer at the election of the policyowner. If the policy was thus terminated or replaced, there are no available records.
Finally, if the inquiry relates to a former group life or group health insurance policy, all such contracts were transferred to affiliates of the Fortis, Inc. Group in 1991. For further information, contact:
Fortis Benefits Insurance Company

The company's original headquarters building at 300 Broadway in Newark is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
