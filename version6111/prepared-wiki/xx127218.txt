It was later named for the French explorer Captain Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. In 1786, La Pérouse surveyed and mapped the prominent embayment near the southern cape of Maui opposite the island of Kaho[tpl]okina[/tpl]olawe. The bay is the site of Maui's most recent volcanic activity.[tpl]cite web |title= Youngest lava flows on East Maui probably older than A.D. 1790 |date = September 9, 1999 |publisher= United States Geological Survey |url= http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1999/99_09_09.html [/tpl] The rounded peninsula that dominates the northern half of the bay and extends up the coast a short distance was formed about 900,000 years ago by an eruption of basaltic lava that originated in the southernmost landward expression of the Haleakalā Southwest Rift Zone. A small string of cinder cones extending inland to the northeast marks the axis of the rift zone.
La Perouse Bay lies directly south of the Ahihi-Kinau Natural Area Reserve. Fishing is prohibited within the reserve, which is home to many endemic and other fish species, marine mammals, green sea turtles, and coastal plants.[tpl]cite news |title= a Rock and a Hard Place: Four conservationists explore the past and future of Keone’o’io |work= Maui No Ka 'Oi Magazine |volume= 8 Number 4 |author= Shannon Wianecki |date= Winter 2005 |url= http://www.mauimagazine.net/Maui-Magazine/Winter-2005/Between-a-Rock-and-a-Hard-Place/ [/tpl] Article about La Perouse Bay and efforts to conserve the natural environment.
