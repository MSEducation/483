Mare Street is a street in Hackney.  It has existed since the 15th century, when it was one of the first roads at the centre of the parish.  It was then known as Merestret.  The word mere was either the Old English mǣre meaning a boundary — referring to the boundary with the parish of Stepney — or mere, a large pond which was fed by Hackney Brook.[tpl]citation |title=Discovering London Street Names |page=80 |isbn=0747803099 |author=John Wittich |year=1996 |quote=Mare Street, E8 A large pond fed by the Hackney Brook caused constant trouble to coaches and their passengers in the eighteenth century.
