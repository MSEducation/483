Exogini: i misteriosi alieni (lit. Exogenous: the mysterious aliens), is a famous bootleg keshi (in the likes of the popular M.U.S.C.L.E. and Monster In My Pocket) composite line only released in Italy around the late '80s, early '90s. The Sesto Fiorentino based GIG Spa company, did mixed three different imported keshi lines to create its own franchise. Around the same period, the Exogini line was marketed in France as Cosmix by Ideal SA.

==History==

The models and even the leaflet catalogues were identical, however the package and character names were totally different. The gum colors and types were also distinct to each line with the exception of the generic "salmon matte" type. The Exogini had more gum variations than the Cosmix line and the third keshi series did not appeared in the French line.
Falsely marketed as a unique extra terrestrials line, the Exogini were actually, decent quality, model replicas taken from three distinct keshi lines made of wrestlers, ninjas and crustacean monsters. The superchery was revealed by collectors a decade after the Exogini sale out.

===Kinkeshi series (1987)===

The first line is the most looked after by collectors for it is a selection of forty Kinkeshi ("Kinnikuman series 1984-87" aka M.U.S.C.L.E.), whose are keshi based on the popular Kinnikuman Japanese comic book and anime TV series created in 1979. Several generations of video games helped to popularize the franchise worldwide. This series was part of the Cosmix keshi line.

===Fistful Of Alien series (1998)===

Instead of the Kinnikuman and N.I.N.J.A.S. characters, these erasers were insect/crustacean-like characters. It was actually a selection of full color hand painted keshis made in China and taken from the American Fistful Of Aliens line. This line is not available in the parallel Cosmix line.
