RTÉ Gold is an Irish radio station broadcasting on DAB and Saorview Ireland's free to air DTT service. It can also be accessed on the internet via the RTÉ website. The station plays classic hits from top-selling artists spanning the decades from the 1950s to the 1980s.  A particular feature of the current scheduling on RTÉ Gold is the inclusion, next to hits, of album tracks not normally available in a competitive classic hits format.
Although essentially a playlist service, it does produce one presenter-led programme called Through The Looking Glass. It formerly known as The Magic Carpet Ride, and began broadcasting on RTÉ Gold in March 2008. The programme specialises in playing music from the 1960s, with an average show consisting of a mixture of the fairly well known and the relatively obscure. The idea behind the programme is to give the listener a different perspective on the music from this particular decade. After a break of a few months, TTLG began airing again at the beginning of May 2009.
