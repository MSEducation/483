The Circassians are a North Caucasian ethnic group[tpl]citation | title = One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups | publisher = Questia Online Library | date = 25 August 2010 | page = 12[/tpl] native to Circassia who were displaced in the course of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus in the 19th century, especially after the Russian–Circassian War of 1862. The term "Circassian" includes the Adyghe (Circassian: Адыгэ, Adyge) and Kabardian people.[tpl]citation | last = Gammer | first = Mos%u030Ce | title = The Caspian Region: a Re-emerging Region | place = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 2004 | page = 67[/tpl]
The Adyghe mainly speak the Adyghe language, a Northwest Caucasian language with numerous dialects. The Adyghe also speak Turkish and Arabic in large numbers and various other languages of the Middle East, having been exiled by Russia to lands of the Ottoman Empire, where the majority of them today live, and to a lesser extent neighboring Persia, where most of them came either deported en masse by the Safavids and Qajars, or to a lesser extent as muhajirs in the 19th century like in Ottoman Turkey.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carkas-cherkes-term-used-in-persian-arabic-and-turkic-for-the-circassian-people-of-the-northwest-caucasus-who-call-thems|title=ČARKAS|accessdate=26 April 2014[/tpl]Oberling, Pierre, Georgians and Circassians in Iran, The Hague, 1963; pp.127-143Engelbert Kaempfer (p. 204)Khanbaghi, Aptin, ''The Fire, the Star and the Cross; minority religions in Medieval and Early Modern Iran, pp. 130[tpl]cite web|url=http://mcha.kbsu.ru/english/m_hist_01E.htm.html|title=International Circassian Association|accessdate=26 April 2014[/tpl] The predominant religion amongst Circassians is Sunni Islam.
There remain about 700,000 Circassians in historical Circassia (the republics of Adygea, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, and the southern half of Krasnodar Krai), as well as a number in the Russian Federation outside these republics. The 2010 Russian Census recorded 718,727 Circassians, of which 516,826 are Kabardians, 124,835 are Adyghe proper, 73,184 are Cherkess and 3,882 Shapsugs.Russian Census 2010: Population by ethnicity [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]
The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization estimates that there are as many as 3.7 million "ethnic Circassians" in the diaspora outside the Circassian republics (meaning that only one in seven "ethnic Circassians" lives in the homeland), of whom about 2 million live in Turkey, 700,000 in the Russian Federation, about 150,000 in the Levant and Mesopotamia, and about 50,000 in Europe and the United States.

==Names==

In their own language the Circassians refer to themselves as Adyghe (also transliterated as Adyga, Adyge, Adygei, Adyghe, Attéghéi). The name is believed to derive from atté "height" to signify a mountaineer or a highlander, and ghéi "sea", signifying "a people dwelling and inhabiting a mountainous country near the sea coast", or "between two seas".[ref]

A common name for the Adyghe is Circassians ([tpl]respell|ser|KASS|ee-uhnz[/tpl]), a name which is occasionally applied to Adyghe and Abaza from the North Caucasus.[ref]Latham, R. G. Elements of Comparative Philology. London, Walton and Maberly, 1862. P. 279.
[/ref] The name Circassian represents a Latinisation of Cherkess, the Turkic name for the Adyghe, and originated in the 15th century with medieval Genoese merchants and travellers to Circassia.Latham, R. G. Descriptive Ethnology. London, J. Van Voorst, 1859. P. 50.
But the earliest known form of the name "Cherkess" dates from the time of the Mongols who invaded the North Caucasus in medieval times, and who called the Adyghe "Serkesut" - that term appears in Mongol texts from the 12th century.

==History==

===Origins===

The Adyghe people originate in the North Caucasus region, an area they are believed to have occupied as early as the Stone Age period, with traces of them dating back as far as 8000 BC.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] In about 4000 BC, the Maykop culture flourished in the North Caucasus region, which influenced all subsequent cultures in the North Caucasus region as well as other parts of the region that is now southern Russia. Archaeological findings, mainly of dolmens in North-West Caucasus region, indicate a megalithic culture in the region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.circassianmuseum.co.il/history.php |title=המרכז למורשת הצ'רקסית בכפר קמא |publisher=www.circassianmuseum.co.il |date= [/tpl]
The Adyghe kingdom was established in about 400 BC. After 460 AD, reports of "Utige" begins to feature in connection to a state established around Phanagoria, which grew into Old Great Bulgaria. After the collapse of this state under pressure from the Khazars, the Adyghe people did not seem to unite politically. This reduced their influence in the area and their ability to withstand periodic invasions from groups like the Mongols, Avars, Pechenegs, Huns, and Khazars.
Genetically, the Adyghe population has shared ancestry mainly with neighboring peoples of the Caucasus, with some influence from other regions.[tpl]Citation| last = Li| first = Jun| coauthors = Devin M.

===Medieval period===

Christianity reached and spread throughout the Caucasus between the 4th centuryThe Penny Magazine. London, Charles Knight, 1838. P. 138. and the 6th centuryMinahan, James. One Europe, Many Nations: a Historical Dictionary of European National Groups. Westport, USA, Greenwood, 2000. P. 354. under Greek Byzantine influence and later through the Georgians between the 10th century and the 13th century. During that period, the Circassians (referred to in the medieval period as Kassogs) began to accept Christianity as their national religion, but did not fully adopt Christianity as elements of their ancient indigenous religious beliefs still survived. In the 15th century, under the influence of Crimean Tatars and Ottoman clerics, the Circassians adopted Islam.
Most of the Mamluks were originally Georgian, Adyghe and Turkish slaves who were gathered by the Arab sultans to serve their kingdoms as a military force.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] Others, however, say that the Mamluks were mostly Cumans and Kipchaks.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] During the 13th century, the Mamluks seized power in Cairo, and as a result the Mamluk kingdom became the most influential kingdom in the Muslim world. The majority of the leaders of the Mamluk kingdom were of Adyghe origin. Even after Egypt was conquered by the Ottoman Turks, the Adyghes continued to rule in Egypt until the 18th century.
With the rise of Muhammad Ali Pasha, almost all the senior Mamluks were killed and the remaining Mamluks fled to Sudan.
Today, several thousand Adyghes reside in Egypt and they are the descendants of these Mamluks.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Until the rise of Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt, the Adyghes were an elite group in the country. The single remaining exception is the Egyptian Abaza family that holds to this day an elite place in Egyptian society. It constitutes Egypt's largest family and largest Abazin minority. (See Abaza family.)
Large numbers of Circassians converted to Islam from Christianity in the 17th century."Rekhaniya". Jewish Virtual Library.
In Safavid and Qajar Persia, massive amounts of Circassians were imported to Persia, where many enjoyed prestige in the Harems, the elite armies (the so-called ghulams), while others were deployed as craftsmen, labourers, farmers and regular soldiers.
Many members of the Safavid nobility and elite had Circassian ancestry and Circassian dignitaries, such as Shah Abbas II and Shah Suleiman I.
While traces of Circassian settlements remained in Persia/Iran up to the early 20th century, virtually all Circassians got absorbed in the population.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carkas-cherkes-term-used-in-persian-arabic-and-turkic-for-the-circassian-people-of-the-northwest-caucasus-who-call-thems
However, there are still small pockets living in particular cities in Iran, like Tabriz, Tehran and the northern provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/118238/Circassianhttp://www.fofweb.com/History/MainPrintPage.asp?iPin=EEPI0143&DataType=WorldHistory&WinType=Free
It has been estimated that some 200,000 slaves—mainly Circassians—were imported into the Ottoman Empire between 1800 and 1909.W. G. Clarence-Smith (2006). "Islam And The Abolition Of Slavery".

===Russian conquest of Circassia===

[tpl]Quotation|Circassia was a small independent nation on the northeastern shore of the Black Sea. For no reason other than ethnic hatred, over the course of hundreds of raids the Russians drove the Circassians from their homeland and deported them to the Ottoman Empire. At least 600,000 people lost their lives to massacre, starvation, and the elements while hundreds of thousands more were forced to leave their homeland. By 1864, three-fourths of the population was annihilated, and the Circassians had become one of the first stateless peoples in modern history.|Walter Richmond|The Circassian Genocide [tpl]cite book|last=Richmond|first=Walter|title=The Circassian Genocide|year=2013|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=back cover|nopp=y|isbn=978-0-8135-6069-4|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LHlwZwpA70cC[/tpl][/tpl]
Between the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries, the Adyghe people lost their independence as they were slowly conquered by Russia in a series of wars and campaigns. During this period, the Adyghe plight achieved a certain celebrity status in the West, but pledges of assistance were never fulfilled. After the Crimean War, Russia turned her attention to the Caucasus in earnest, starting with the peoples of Chechnya and Dagestan. In 1859, the Russians had finished defeating Imam Shamil in the eastern Caucasus, and turned their attention westward. Eventually, the long lasting Russian–Circassian War ended with the defeat of the Adyghe forces. Adyghe leaders signed loyalty oaths on 2 June 1864 (21 May, O.S.).
The Conquest of the Caucasus by the Russian Empire in the 19th century during the Russian-Circassian War, led to the destruction and killing of many Adyghe—towards the end of the conflict, the Russian General Yevdokimov was tasked with driving the remaining Circassian inhabitants out of the region, primarily into the Ottoman Empire. This policy was enforced by mobile columns of Russian riflemen and Cossack cavalry.Levene 2005:297[tpl]citation | last = Richmond | chapter = 4[/tpl] [tpl]clarify|date=May 2013[/tpl]King 2008: 94–6. "In a series of sweeping military campaigns lasting from 1860 to 1864 ... the northwest Caucasus and the Black Sea coast were virtually emptied of Muslim villagers. Columns of the displaced were marched either to the Kuban River plains or toward the coast for transport to the Ottoman Empire ... One after another, entire Circassian tribal groups were dispersed, resettled, or killed en masse" This expulsion, along with the actions of the Russian military in acquiring Circassian land,Shenfield, Stephen D., 1999.

Series: War and Genocide; 1. 149–62. has given rise to a movement among descendants of the expelled ethnicities for international recognition that genocide was perpetrated.UNPO 2006. In 1840, Karl Friedrich Neumann estimated the Circassian casualties to be around one and a half million.Neumann 1840 Some sources state that hundreds of thousands of others died during the exodus.Shenfield 1999 Several historians use the phrase "Circassian massacres"Levene 2005:299 for the consequences of Russian actions in the region.Levene 2005 : 302

Like other ethnic minorities under Russian rule, the Adyghe who remained in the Russian Empire borders were subjected to policies of mass resettlement.
The Ottoman Empire, which ruled most of the area south of Russia, considered the Adyghe warriors to be courageous and well-experienced. It encouraged them to settle in various near-border settlements of the Ottoman empire in order to strengthen the empire's borders.

===Post-exile period===

The Adyghes who were settled by the Ottomans in various near-border settlements across the empire, ended up living across many different territories in the Middle East. At the time these belonged to the Ottoman Empire and are now located in the following countries:

==Culture==

Adyghe society prior to the Russian invasion was highly stratified. While a few tribes in the mountainous regions of Adygeya were fairly egalitarian, most were broken into strict castes. The highest was the caste of the "princes", followed by a caste of lesser nobility, and then commoners, serfs, and slaves. In the decades before Russian rule, two tribes overthrew their traditional rulers and set up democratic processes, but this social experiment was cut short by the end of Adyghe independence.

===Language===

Circassians mainly speak the Circassian language, a Northwest Caucasian language with numerous dialects, the primary ones being Adyghe (West Circassian) and Kabardian (East Circassian). Circassians also speak Turkish and Arabic in large numbers, having being exiled by Russia to lands of the Ottoman Empire, where the majority of them live today.
Lesser numbers of Circassians speak Russian, English, and  German.
The native language is spoken among all the Circassian communities around the world, with about 125,000 speakers who live in the Russian Federation, some of whom live in the Republic of Adygea where the Adyghe language is defined as the official language. The world's largest Adyghe-speaking community is the Circassian community in Turkey — it has about 150,000 Adyghe speakers.
The Circassians who migrated to the United States are facing an asimiliation crisis. Each new generation of circassians are not preserving their language. Historians predict the language will be extinct within the next 50 years in the U.S.

===Religion===

The ethnic religion of Circassians (Adyghes) was Habze — a philosophical and religious system of personal values and the relationship of an individual to others, to the world around him, and to the Higher Mind. In essence, it represents monotheism with a much-defined system of worshipping One God — the Mighty Tha (Tha, Thashxue). During the time of the settlement of Greek cities / colonies on the coast of the Black Sea there was an intermingling of cultures. Circassian mythology has noticeable aspects from Greek mythology. In return, there is evidence that Greek mythology also borrowed from Circassian legends. In the 6th century, under Byzantine influence, many Adyghes became Christian, but under the growing influence of the Ottomans, many of them became Muslims. Throughout Circassian history the ethnic religion of Circassians has interacted with Christianity and Islam.
Christianity reached and spread throughout the Caucasus and was first introduced between the 4th century and the 6th century under Greek Byzantine influence and later through the Georgians between the 10th century and the 13th century. During that period, Circassians began to accept Christianity as their national religion, but did not fully adopt Christianity as elements of their ancient indigenous religious beliefs still survived.
Islam reached the northeastern region of the Caucasus, principally Dagestan, as early as the 7th century, but was first introduced to the Circassians between the 16th century and in the middle of the 19th century under the influence of the Crimean Tatars, the Ottoman Turks and the Persians. It was only after the Russian conquest of the Caucasus when Circassians as well as other peoples of the Caucasus were forced out of their ancestral homeland and settled in different regions of the Ottoman Empire did they begin to fully accept and adopt Islam as their national religion.
The Naqshbandi tariqa of Sufi Islam was also introduced to the Circassians in the late 18th century under the influence of Sheikh Mansur who was the first to preach the Naqshbandi tariqa in the northeastern region of the Caucasus and later through Imam Shamil in the middle of the 19th century.
In the modern days, it has been reported that some Circassians practice their traditional religious faith Habzism, whose adherents constitute 12% of the population of Karachay-Cherkessia and 3% of the population of Kabardino-Balkaria.Arena - Atlas of Religions and Nationalities in Russia • sreda.org2012 Survey Maps. "Ogonek". No 34 (5243), 27 August 2012. Retrieved 24-09-2012. There have also been reports of violence against those practising the older religion. Aslan Tsipinov, an advocate of Habzism in Kabardino-Balkaria, was murdered by radical Islamists in 2010, who had warned him months earlier to stop publicizing the rituals of the original Circassian faith.North Caucasus Insurgency Admits Killing Circassian Ethnographer.

Eurasia Daily Monitor, volume 8, issue 1, 2011. Retrieved 24-09-2012.
Today, the majority of Circassians are predominantly Sunni Muslim and adhere to the Hanafi school of thought, or law, the largest and oldest school of Islamic law in jurisprudence within Sunni Islam. There is also a small number of Catholics, the faith having been introduced to the area during the Middle Ages by Venetian and Genoese traders, who now account for just under 1% of Russia's Circassians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sreda.org/arena |title=Главная страница проекта "Арена" : Некоммерческая Исследовательская Служба СРЕДА |publisher=Sreda.org |accessdate=20 August 2013[/tpl]

====Adyghe Khabze====

Adyghe Khabze ([tpl]lang-ady|Адыгэ Хабзэ[/tpl]) is the native Circassian religion, philosophy and worldview, it is the epitome of Circassian culture and tradition having deeply shaped the ethical values of the Adyghe. It is their code of honour and is based on mutual respect and above all requires responsibility, discipline and self-control. Adyghe Xabze functions as the Circassian unwritten law yet was highly regulated and adhered to in the past. The Code requires that all Circassians are taught courage, reliability and generosity. Greed, desire for possessions, wealth and ostentation are considered disgraceful ("Yemiku") by the Xabze code. In accordance with Xabze, hospitality was and is particularly pronounced among the Circassians. A guest is not only a guest of the host family, but equally a guest of the whole village and clan. Even enemies are regarded as guests if they enter the home and being hospitable to them as one would with any other guest is a sacred duty.
Circassians consider the host to be like a slave to the guest in that the host is expected to tend to the guest's every need and want. A guest must never be permitted to labour in any way, this is considered a major disgrace on the host.
Every Circassian arises when someone enters the room, providing a place for the person entering and allowing the newcomer to speak before everyone else during the conversation. In the presence of elders and women respectful conversation and conduct are essential. Disputes are stopped in the presence of women and domestic disputes are never continued in the presence of guests. A woman can request disputing families to reconcile and they must comply with her request. A key figure in Circassian culture is the person known as the "T'hamade" ([tpl]lang-ady|Тхьэмадэ - Тхьэматэ[/tpl]), who is often an elder but also the person who carries the responsibility for functions like weddings or circumcision parties. This person must always comply with all the rules of Xabze in all areas of his life.

===Traditional clothing===

The Adyghe traditional clothing ([tpl]lang-ady |Адыгэ Щыгъыныхэр[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ady|aːdəɣa ɕəʁənəxar|[/tpl]) refers to the historical clothing worn by the Adyghe people.
The traditional female clothing ([tpl]lang-ady |Бзылъфыгъэ Шъуашэр[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ady|bzəɬfəʁa ʂʷaːʃar|[/tpl]) was very diverse and highly decorated and mainly depends on the region, class of family, occasions, and tribes. The traditional female costume is composed of a dress ([tpl]lang-ady |Джанэр[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ady|d͡ʒaːnar|[/tpl]), coat ([tpl]lang-ady |Сае[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ady|saːja|[/tpl]), shirt, pant ([tpl]lang-ady |ДжэнэкӀакор [/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ady|d͡ʒanat͡ʃʼaːkʷar|[/tpl]), vest ([tpl]lang-ady |КӀэкӀ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ady|t͡ʃʼat͡ʃʼ|[/tpl]), lamb leather bra ([tpl]lang-ady |Шъохътан[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ady|ʂʷaχtaːn|[/tpl]), a variety of hats ([tpl]lang-ady |ПэӀохэр[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ady|paʔʷaxar|[/tpl]), shoes, and belts ([tpl]lang-ady |Бгырыпхыхэр[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ady|bɣərəpxəxar|[/tpl]). Holiday dresses are made of expensive fabrics such as silk and velvet. The traditional colors of women's clothing rarely includes blue, green or bright-colored tones, instead mostly white, red, black and brown shades are worn.
The traditional male costume ([tpl]lang-ady |Адыгэ хъулъфыгъэ шъуашэр[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ady|aːdəɣa χʷəɬfəʁa ʂʷaːʃar|[/tpl] ) includes a coat with wide sleeves, shirt, pants, a dagger, sword, and a variety of hats and shoes. Traditionally, young men in the warriors times wore coat with short sleeves—in order to feel more comfortable in combat. Different colors of clothing for males were strictly used to distinguish between different social classes, for example white is usually worn by princes, red by nobles, gray, brown, and black by peasants (blue, green and the other colors were rarely worn). A compulsory item in the traditional male costume is a dagger and a sword. The traditional Adyghean sword is called Shashka. It is a special kind of sabre; a very sharp, single-edged, single-handed, and guardless sword. Although the sword is used by most of Russian and Ukrainian Cossacks, the typically Adyghean form of the sabre is longer than the Cossack type, and in fact the word Shashka came from the Adyghe word "Sashkhwa" ([tpl]lang-ady |Сашьхъуэ[/tpl]) which means "long knife".

===Traditional cuisine===

The Adyghe cuisine is rich with different dishes.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yHeq6UZxf8 |title=Jordanian Cuisine(Bedouins, Circassians, & Palestinians)(مترجم للعربية) |publisher=YouTube |date=14 January 2012 |accessdate=20 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.circassianworld.com/AdygheCuisine.pdf |title=AdygheCuisine|publisher=Circassianworld.com |accessdate=20 August 2013[/tpl] In the summer, the traditional dishes consumed by the Adyghe people are mainly dairy products and vegetable dishes. In the winter and spring the traditional dishes are mainly flour and meat dishes. An example of the latter is known as ficcin.
Circassian cheese is considered one of the more famous types of cheeses in the North Caucasus.
A popular traditional dish is chicken or turkey with sauce, seasoned with crushed garlic and red pepper. Mutton and beef are served boiled, usually with a seasoning of sour milk with crushed garlic and salt.
Variants of pasta are found. A type of ravioli may be encountered, which is filled with potato or beef.
On holidays the Adyghe people traditionally make Haliva ([tpl]lang-ady|хьэлжъо[/tpl]) (fried triangular pasties with mainly Circassian cheese or potato), from toasted millet or wheat flour in syrup, baked cakes and pies. In the Levant there is a famous Circassian dish which is called Tajen Alsharkaseiah.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju90EXQUKY0 |title=‫تركى شركسية تقديم الشيف الشربينى |publisher=YouTube |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2013[/tpl]

===Traditional crafts===

The Adyghes have been famous for making carpets ([tpl]lang-ady| пӏуаблэхэр[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ady|pʷʼaːblaxar|[/tpl]) or mats worldwide for thousands of years.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Making carpets was very hard work in which collecting raw materials is restricted to a specific period of time within the year. The raw materials were dried, and based on the intended colours, different methods of drying were applied. For example, when dried in the shade, its colour changed to a beautiful light gold colour. If it were dried in direct sun light then it would have a silver colour, and if they wanted to have a dark colour for the carpets, the raw materials were put in a pool of water and covered by poplar leaves ([tpl]lang-ady| екӏэпцӏэ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ady|jat͡ʃʼapt͡sʼa|[/tpl]).
The carpets were adorned with images of birds, beloved animals (horses), and plants, and the image of the Sun was widely used.
The carpets were used for different reasons due to their characteristic resistance to humidity and cold, and in retaining heat. Also, there was a tradition in Circassian homes to have two carpets hanging in the guest room, one used to hang over rifles ([tpl]lang-ady| шхончымрэ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ady|ʃxʷant͡ʃəmra|[/tpl]) and pistols ([tpl]lang-ady| къэлаеымрэ[/tpl]), and the other used to hang over musical instruments.
The carpets were used to pray upon, and it was necessary for every Circassian girl to make three carpets before marriage; a big carpet, a small carpet, and the last for praying as a prayer rug. These carpets would give the grooms an impression as to the success of their brides in their homes after marriage."Адыгэ 1оры1уатэм ухэзгъэгъозэн тхылъ", Ехъул1э Ат1ыф, Нахэхэр (129-132), гощын (1), Адыгэ ш1уш1э Хасэ, Йордания, 2009.

==Circassian tribes==

From the late Middle Ages, a number of territorial- and political-based Circassian tribes or ethnic entities began to take shape. Their culture, traditions, and way of life differed little.
At the end of the Caucasian War with most Circassians were expelled to the Ottoman Empire, many of the tribes were destroyed or evicted from their historical homeland.
Most Adyghe living in Circassia are Bzhedugh, Kabarday and Kemirgoy, while the majority in diaspora are Abzekh and Shapsugh. Standard Adyghe language is based on Kemirgoy dialect.

Adyghe have lived outside the Caucasus region since the Middle Ages. They were particularly well represented in the Mamluks of Turkey and Egypt. In fact, the Burji dynasty which ruled Egypt from 1382 to 1517 was founded by Adyghe Mamluks.
Much of Adyghe culture was disrupted after the conquest of their homeland by Russia in 1864. The Circassian people were subjected to ethnic cleansing and mass exile to the Ottoman Empire.
The total number of Circassians worldwide is estimated at 6 million.

===Western Asia===

Around half of all Circassians live in Turkey, mainly in the provinces of Samsun and Ordu (in Northern Turkey), Kahramanmaraş (in Southern Turkey), Kayseri (in Central Turkey), Bandırma and Düzce (in Northwest Turkey).
Significant communities live in Jordan,[tpl]cite web|url=http://languageserver.uni-graz.at/ls/lang?id=3044 |title=Significant numbers of Adyghe speakers reside in Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and Israel |publisher=Languageserver.uni-graz.at |accessdate=20 August 2013[/tpl] Syria (see Circassians in Syria), and smaller communities live in Israel (in the villages of Kfar Kama and Rehaniya — see Circassians in Israel), and Iraq.
Iran once had a very large community, but the vast majority were assimilated in the population in the course of centuries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mcha.kbsu.ru/english/m_hist_01E.htm.html|title=International Circassian Association|accessdate=28 April 2014[/tpl]Pierre, Oberling Georgians and Circassians in Iran[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iran-vii6-in-islamic-iran-language-families|title=IRAN vii.

===Egypt and Libya===

Circassian communities existed in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia and were assimilated into the local population.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDd80jyLptI |title=Al-Gaddafi speech about the Circassians|publisher=Youtube.com |date=30 July 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2013[/tpl]

===Europe===

There are Circassians in Germany and a small number in the Netherlands.
Out of 1,010 Circassians living in Ukraine (473 Kabardins, 338 Adygeis and 199 Cherkesses — after the existing Soviet division of Circassians into three groups), only 181 (17.9%) declared fluency in the native language; 96 (9.5%) declared Ukrainian as native language and 697 (69%) marked "other language" as their native and most likely the latter is Russian, though none openly declared it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/nationality_population/nationality_1/s5/?botton=cens_db&box=5.1W&k_t=00&p=0&rz=1_1&rz_b=2_1%20%20 |title=&n_page=1 All Ukrainian Census 2001 |publisher=2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua |accessdate=20 August 2013[/tpl] The major Adyghe community in Ukraine is in Odessa.
There may be a small community of Circassians in Serbia and Macedonia. A number of Adyghe also settled in Bulgaria in 1864–1865 but most fled after it became separate from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. The small community that settled in Kosovo (the Kosovo Adyghes) repatriated to the Republic of Adygea in 1998.

===North America===

A large number of Circassians have also immigrated to the United States and settled in Upstate New York, California, and New Jersey. There is also a small Circassian community in Canada.

==Sochi Olympics controversy==

The 2014 Winter Olympics facilities in Sochi (once the Circassian capital) are being built in areas that are claimed to contain mass graves of Circassians who were killed during genocide by Russia in military campaigns lasting from 1860 to 1864.http://world.time.com/2014/02/06/sochi-olympics-russia-circassians/
Adyghe organizations in Russia and the Adyghe diaspora around the world have requested that the construction at the site would stop and that the Olympic games would not be held at the site of the Adyghe genocide to prevent the desecration of the Adyghe graves.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] According to Iyad Youghar, who heads the lobby group International Circassian Council: "We want the athletes to know that if they compete here they will be skiing on the bones of our relatives." The year 2014 also marked the 150th anniversary of the Circassian Genocide which angered the Circassians around the world. Many protests were held all over the world to stop the Sochi Olympics but were not successful.

==In popular culture==

Over the years, Adyghes have been featured in various popular books and films:
