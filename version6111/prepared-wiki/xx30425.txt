==History==

===Pre-European era===

For thousands of years, this area was occupied along the rivers by varying cultures of indigenous peoples.  At the time of European encounter, Clarke County was the traditional home of the Choctaw and the Creek people. They traded with the French, who had settlements in Mobile and New Orleans. They also were reached by some English and Scots traders from the British colonies along the Atlantic Coast.  After the Louisiana Purchase, they started to establish relations with the United States.
In 1805, by the Treaty of Mount Dexter, the Choctaw conveyed large amounts of land in what is now southeastern Mississippi and southwestern Alabama, including much of the western portion of Clarke County, to the United States for settlement by European Americans.[tpl]cite journal|last=Finlay|first=Louis M., Jr.|title=The Mitchell Reserve|journal=Clarke County Historical Society Quarterly|date=Summer 2000|year=2000|volume=25|issue=1|pages=9|accessdate=July 27, 2011[/tpl]
