Route 42 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey within the Camden area. It runs [tpl]convert|14.28|mi|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] from an intersection with U.S. Route 322 and County Route 536 Spur in Monroe Township, Gloucester County to an intersection with Interstate 76 and Interstate 295 in Bellmawr, Camden County. The route is a mix of freeway and divided four-lane arterial road. The southern portion of Route 42 is a local arterial route and one of several highways comprising the Black Horse Pike, a road that runs from Camden to Atlantic City. The northern portion is a six- to eight-lane freeway referred to locally as the North–South Freeway (or simply the 42 Freeway[tpl]cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&id=6276126|title=Man injured after allegedly car surfing on I-295|date=July 20, 2008|publisher=WPVI-TV|accessdate=2008-10-10[/tpl]) that is directly connected to the Atlantic City Expressway.  Major intersections along the route include the Atlantic City Expressway and the southern terminus of Route 168 in Turnersville, another intersection with Route 168 in Blackwood, and Route 41 and Route 55 in Deptford Township.
Route 42 was originally designated in 1927 to run along the Black Horse Pike between Ferry Avenue in Camden and the present U.S. Route 40/U.S. Route 322 split in the McKee City section of Hamilton Township, Atlantic County. In 1953, the southern terminus was cut back to its current terminus in the Williamstown section of Monroe Township to avoid the concurrency it shared with U.S. Route 322. After the completion of the North–South Freeway between Bellmawr and Turnersville in 1959, Route 42 was moved to this freeway, and the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168. The freeway portion of Route 42 has been improved many times and is projected to see more improvements, including reconstruction of the dangerous and congested interchange with Interstate 76 and Interstate 295 in Bellmawr.

==Route description==

===Black Horse Pike===

Route 42 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 322 and County Route 536 Spur in Monroe Township, Gloucester County where it heads to the north on the Black Horse Pike. For the first portion of the route, Route 42 is a divided four–lane arterial highway that intersects various local roads. Some intersections along this section feature jughandles.  There are also many businesses lining the highway.[tpl]google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=route+42+and+route+322+williamstown,+nj&daddr=39.732538,-75.036621+to:route+42+and+I-295+bellmawr,+nj&geocode=&hl=en&mra=dpe&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=11&via=1&sll=39.772425,-75.039345&sspn=0.248042,0.439453&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=11 |title=overview of New Jersey Route 42 |accessdate=2009-04-01[/tpl] The route crosses County Route 689 (Berlin-Cross Keys Road) and enters  Washington Township. It then intersects the northern terminus of County Route 555 (Tuckahoe Road). After the intersection with County Route 555, Route 42 intersects three more county routes: County Route 655 (Fries Mill Road), County Route 639 (Ganttown Road), and County Route 651 (Greentree Road). The Atlantic City Expressway then starts to the right at an unnumbered intersection, Route 168 continues to the north on the Black Horse Pike, and Route 42 becomes the six–lane North–South Freeway.

===North–South Freeway===

thumb|right|200px|Route 42 southbound at the Atlantic City Expressway split in TurnersvilleUpon becoming the North–South Freeway, Route 42 crosses into Gloucester Township, Camden County and comes to the first numbered exit for County Route 705, which provides access to Route 168. Following that, the freeway reaches the County Route 673 (College Drive) interchange, serving Camden County College. County Route 534 interchanges with a southbound exit and northbound entrance and then Coles Road interchanges with a northbound exit and southbound entrance. Next, Route 42 encounters Exits 9B and 10A for Route 168. Exit 9B serves northbound Route 168 and provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike, and Exit 10A serves southbound Route 168. County Route 681 interchanges after Route 168, with a southbound exit and northbound entrance, and Route 42 enters Gloucester County again in Deptford Township after crossing the South Branch of Big Timber Creek.
In Deptford Township, Route 41 interchanges with a northbound exit and an entrance in both directions. Past this interchange, County Route 544 interchanges with a southbound exit and an entrance in both directions. Both of these interchanges provide access to the Deptford Mall and, in the case of the Route 41 interchange, to Route 55 from northbound Route 42 since the northbound lanes have no direct access to Route 55. Route 42 meets the northern terminus of the Route 55 freeway at Exit 13 with a southbound exit and northbound entrance then widens to eight lanes. Route 42 crosses the Big Timber Creek into Runnemede, Camden County, where it passes over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange.  The freeway then enters Bellmawr, where it features right-in/right-out ramps with Leaf Avenue, that provide access to County Route 753 (Creek Road).  Route 42 then continues north to its terminus at Interstate 295 where the North–South Freeway becomes Interstate 76, which heads to Camden and Philadelphia .
The North–South Freeway portion of Route 42 is a major route for daily commuters from southern New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania via the Walt Whitman Bridge and Ben Franklin Bridge and weekend commuters from southeastern Pennsylvania to the southern Jersey Shore via Route 55 and the Atlantic City Expressway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/works/studies/rt295/|title=I-295/I-76/Route 42 Direct Connection|publisher=New Jersey Department of Transportation|accessdate=2008-10-10[/tpl] Even though Route 42 ends at I-295, the north–south Freeway is sometimes called "Route 42" all the way to the Interstate 76/Interstate 676 split.[tpl]cite news|first=Nedra|last=Lindsey|pages=B12|title=Suspect in shoplifting jailed after car chase|date=January 17, 2002|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer[/tpl] "He was pursued back to Haddonfield-Berlin Road, onto Interstate 295, then to Route 42 and onto Route 130, police said."

==History==

In 1927, Route 42 was legislated to run along the Black Horse Pike, a road that traces its origins back to 1855. In that year, the Camden and Blackwoodstown Turnpike Company was established by entrepreneurs who had helped create the White Horse Pike to build a gravel road that would run from Camden south to Blackwoodtown and eventually to Atlantic City,[tpl]cite news|title=Answer Guy: How did the White Horse and Black Horse Pikes get their names?|publisher=The Press of Atlantic City|date=August 31, 2008[/tpl]  from Ferry Avenue in Camden to Route 48 (now U.S. Route 40) in McKee City.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319.[tpl]cite map|url=http://www.jimmyandsharonwilliams.com/njroads/1920s/images/1927_routes.gif|title=1927 New Jersey Road Map|publisher=State of New Jersey| accessdate=2008-10-08[/tpl]  By 1941, U.S. Route 322 was assigned to follow the routing of Route 42 between Williamstown and McKee City.[tpl]cite map|publisher=Mid-West Map Co.|title= Map of Pennsylvania and New Jersey |year=1941|cartography=H.M.

The North–South Freeway portion of Route 42 was originally planned as a parkway in 1932 that would run from the Ben Franklin Bridge in Camden to Atlantic City; however, this proposal never materialized.[tpl]cite book|title=Regional Plan of the Philadelphia Tri-State District|publisher=Regional Planning Federation |year=1932[/tpl] In the late 1940s, the North–South Freeway was proposed by the New Jersey State Highway Department to run from the Ben Franklin Bridge to Turnersville. In the early 1950s, right-of-way for the freeway was acquired and actual construction of the freeway followed.[tpl]cite news|title=Philadelphia's New Shore Route|last=Weart|first=William J.|date=April 21, 1957|publisher=New York Times[/tpl] The Route 42 freeway opened between Interstate 295 in Bellmawr and the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood in 1958.

Following its completion, the North–South Freeway portion of Route 42 has seen many improvements. In 1965, the freeway was widened to six lanes for most of its length with the northernmost part being widened to eight lanes due to the completion of the Atlantic City Expressway and development occurring along the route. The route had its interchange with Route 55 open in 1985, when the Route 55 Freeway was opened from Route 42 to Route 41 to the south.[tpl]cite news|title=Going The Extra Mile For NJ Roads|date=February 18, 1987|publisher=Philadelphia Inquirer[/tpl] Between 1996 and August 1999, the route was widened to eight lanes between Interstate 295 and Route 55 in Deptford Township.[tpl]cite news|title=South Jersey Commuting Could Be Worse|last=Weisenfeld|first=Bernie|date=May 28, 1999|publisher=The Courier-Post [/tpl] In the early 2000s, the interchanges with  Route 41 and County Route 544 in Deptford were rebuilt at a cost of $13 million to improve movements within the area.[tpl]cite news|title=Relief Proposed for Traffic Headache|last=Laughlin|first=Jason|date=April 21, 2000|publisher=The Courier-Post[/tpl] In October 2003, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) installed exit tabs along the stretch of the freeway portion of Route 42.[tpl]cite news|title=New Jersey Promises To Untangle a Traffic Knot|last=Moroz|first=Jennifer|date=November 24, 2004|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer[/tpl] On August 27, 2010, an interchange opened at County Route 673 (College Drive), providing better access to Camden County College.

NJDOT has broken ground on the conspicuously missing express connection between Interstate 295 and Route 42 to finally allow drivers to seamlessly travel from the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and points south to Atlantic City and vice versa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/camden/index.ssf/2013/03/i-295_route_42_interchange_pro.html|title=I-295, Route 42 interchange project breaks ground|publisher=NJ.com|accessdate=2013-04-03[/tpl] The project, dubbed the I-295/I-76/Route 42 Direct Connection, will reconstruct the dangerous and congested Route 42/Interstate 295/Interstate 76 interchange, which currently requires traffic on I-295 to use 35 mile per hour ramps that merge onto the North–South Freeway for a short distance, among a series of other indirect connections.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/commuter/roads/rt295/|title=I-295/I-76/Route 42 Direct Connection|publisher=New Jersey Department of Transportation|accessdate=2013-04-03[/tpl] In 2007, "Alternative D" for the reconstructed interchange was selected, calling for I-295 to cross over the north–south Freeway.
