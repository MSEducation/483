Say It Again was to be Stacie Orrico's second album with "Bounce Back" serving as the album's first single. A release date of April 9, 2002 had been set. However, Virgin records saw mainstream potential with Stacie and signed her, which postponed the release of this album. It was ultimately canceled even after pre-release copies for press were sent out and have since been appearing on eBay. Six of its tracks that were later included on her second album Stacie Orrico, albeit some were drastically remixed, re-recorded, or otherwise altered. There was also an EP version of this album which featured 3 tracks: "Bounce Back", "I Could Be The One", and "That's What Love's About"
