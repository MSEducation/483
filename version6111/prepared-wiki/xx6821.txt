Lake Toba ([tpl]lang-id|Danau Toba[/tpl]) is a lake and supervolcano. The lake is 100 kilometres long, 30 kilometres wide, and up to 505 meters (1,666 ft) deep. Located in the middle of the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra with a surface elevation of about [tpl]convert|900|m|ft|0[/tpl], the lake stretches from [tpl]Coord|2.88|N|98.52|E|[/tpl] to [tpl]Coord|2.35|N|99.1|E|[/tpl]. It is the largest lake in Indonesia and the largest volcanic lake in the world.Worldlakes.org
Lake Toba is the site of a massive supervolcanic eruption estimated at VEI 8 that occurred 69,000 to 77,000 years ago,Global Volcanism Program page on Toba[tpl]cite journal|last=Ninkovich|first=D.|coauthors=N.J.

==Geology==

The Toba caldera complex in Northern Sumatra, comprises four overlapping volcanic craters that adjoin the Sumatran "volcanic front." The youngest and fourth caldera is the world's largest Quaternary caldera ([tpl]convert|100|by|30|km|abbr=on[/tpl]) and intersects the three older calderas. An estimated [tpl]convert|2800|km3|abbr=on[/tpl] of dense-rock equivalent pyroclastic material, known as the youngest Toba tuff, was released during one of the largest explosive volcanic eruptions in recent geological history. Following this eruption, a resurgent dome formed within the new caldera, joining two half-domes separated by a longitudinal graben.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/~raman/papers/ChesnerGeology.pdf|author1=Chesner, C.A. |author2=Westgate, J.A. |author3=Rose, W.I. |author4=Drake, R. |author5=Deino, A. |journal=Geology |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=200–203 |title=Eruptive history of Earth's largest Quaternary caldera (Toba, Indonesia) clarified |publisher=Michigan Technological University |date=March 1991 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |bibcode=1991Geo....19..200C |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1991)0192.3.CO;2[/tpl]
At least four cones, four stratovolcanoes, and three craters are visible in the lake. The Tandukbenua cone on the northwestern edge of the caldera has only sparse vegetation, suggesting a young age of several hundred years. Also, the Pusubukit (Hill Center) volcano (1971 meters above sea level) on the south edge of the caldera is solfatarically active and is a Geology Sanctuary.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0601-09=&volpage=synsub|title=Synonyms and Subfeatures: Toba|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|work=Global Volcanism Program|accessdate=December 13, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://koran-jakarta.com/index.php/detail/view01/113747 |title=Gunung Pusukbuhit |date=March 3, 2013[/tpl]

==The eruption==

The Toba eruption (the Toba event) occurred at what is now Lake Toba about 67,500 to 75,500 years ago.[tpl]cite journal | last = Zielinski | first = G. A. | coauthors = P.A. Mayewski, L.D. Meeker, S. Whitlow, M. Twickler and K. Taylor | year = 1996 | title = Potential Atmospheric impact of the Toba mega-eruption ~71,000 years ago | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 837–840 | publisher = American Geophysical Union | location = United States | doi = 10.1029/96GL00706 | bibcode=1996GeoRL..23..837Z[/tpl] It was the last in a series of at least three caldera-forming eruptions at this location, with earlier calderas having formed around 700,000 and 840,000 years ago. This last eruption had an estimated VEI 8, making it possibly the largest explosive volcanic eruption within the last 25 million years.
Bill Rose and Craig Chesner of Michigan Technological University have estimated that the total amount of material released in the eruption was about [tpl]convert|2800|km3|abbr=on[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2005/05_04_28.html |title=Supersized eruptions are all the rage! |date=April 28, 2005 |publisher=USGS[/tpl]—about [tpl]convert|2000|km3|abbr=on[/tpl] of ignimbrite that flowed over the ground, and approximately [tpl]convert|800|km3|abbr=on[/tpl] that fell as ash mostly to the west. The pyroclastic flows of the eruption destroyed an area of [tpl]convert|20000|km2|0|abbr=on[/tpl], with ash deposits as thick as [tpl]convert|600|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] by the main vent.
The eruption was large enough to have deposited an ash layer approximately [tpl]convert|15|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] thick over all of South Asia; at one site in central India, the Toba ash layer today is up to [tpl]convert|6|m|abbr=on[/tpl] thick[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1006/qres.1993.1051 | last1 = Acharyya | first1 = S.K. | last2 = Basu | first2 = P.K. | year = 1993 | title = Toba ash on the South Asia and its implications for correlation of late pleistocene alluvium | url = | journal = Quaternary Research | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–19 |bibcode = 1993QuRes..40...10A [/tpl] and parts of Malaysia were covered with [tpl]convert|9|m|abbr=on[/tpl] of ash fall.[tpl]cite book |author=Scrivenor, John Brooke |year=1931 |title=The Geology of Malaya |location=London |publisher=MacMillan |oclc=3575130 [/tpl], noted by Weber. In addition it has been variously calculated that [tpl]convert|10000|e6t|ST|lk=on[/tpl] of sulfurous acid or [tpl]convert|6000|e6t|ST[/tpl] of sulfur dioxide were ejected into the atmosphere by the event.
The subsequent collapse formed a caldera that, after filling with water, created Lake Toba. The island in the center of the lake is formed by a resurgent dome.
The exact year of the eruption is unknown, but the pattern of ash deposits suggests that it occurred during the northern summer because only the summer monsoon could have deposited Toba ashfall in the South China Sea.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(2000)0282.3.CO;2 | last1 = Bühring | first1 = C. | last2 = Sarnthein | first2 = M. | last3 = Leg 184 Shipboard Scientific Party | year = 2000 | title = Toba ash layers in the South China Sea: evidence of contrasting wind directions during eruption ca. 74 ka. | url = | journal = Geology | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 275–278 [/tpl] The eruption lasted perhaps two weeks, and the ensuing "volcanic winter" resulted in a decrease in average global temperatures by [tpl]convert|3.0|to|3.5|C-change|F-change|0|abbr=on[/tpl] for several years. Greenland ice cores record a pulse of starkly reduced levels of organic carbon sequestration. Very few plants or animals in southeast Asia would have survived, and it is possible that the eruption caused a planet-wide die-off.
Evidence from studies of mitochondrial DNA suggests that humans may have passed through a genetic bottleneck around this time that reduced genetic diversity below what would be expected given the age of the species. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, proposed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1998, the effects of the Toba eruption may have decreased the size of human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.semp.us/publications/biot_reader.php?BiotID=164 |date=January 11, 2005 |publisher=Suburban Emergency Management Project |title=Yellowstone Is a Supervolcano? |accessdate=2008-02-21 |work=Biot Reports |issue=164 [/tpl] However, this hypothesis is not widely accepted because similar effects on other animal species have not been observed. 

===More recent activity===

Since the major eruption ~70,000 years ago, eruptions of smaller magnitude have also occurred at Toba. The small cone of Pusukbukit formed on the southwestern margin of the caldera and lava domes. The most recent eruption may have been at Tandukbenua on the northwestern caldera edge, suggested by a lack of vegetation that could be due to an eruption within the last few hundred years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.volcanodiscovery.com/volcano-tours/volcanoes/indonesia/sumatra/toba/|title=Toba volcano (Indonesia, Sumatra)|publisher=VolcanoDiscovery.com[/tpl]
Some parts of the caldera have shown uplift due to partial refilling of the magma chamber, for example, pushing Samosir Island and the Uluan Peninsula above the surface of the lake. The lake sediments on Samosir Island show that it has risen by at least [tpl]convert|450|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] since the cataclysmic eruption. Such uplifts are common in very large calderas, apparently due to the upward pressure of below-ground magma. Toba is probably the largest resurgent caldera on Earth. Large earthquakes have recently occurred in the vicinity of the volcano, notably in 1987 along the southern shore of the lake at a depth of [tpl]convert|11|km|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/eqarchives/significant/sig_1987.php|title=Significant Earthquakes of the World|publisher=United States Geological Survey (USGS)[/tpl] Such earthquakes have also been recorded in 1892, 1916, and 1920–1922.[tpl]cite web|url=http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/southeast_asia/indonesia/toba.html|title=Toba, Sumatra, Indonesia|publisher=Oregon State University[/tpl]]
Lake Toba lies near the Great Sumatran fault, which runs along the centre of Sumatra in the Sumatra Fracture Zone. The volcanoes of Sumatra and Java are part of the Sunda Arc, a result of the northeasterly movement of the Indo-Australian Plate, which is sliding under the eastward-moving Eurasian Plate. The subduction zone in this area is very active: the seabed near the west coast of Sumatra has had several major earthquakes since 1995, including the 9.1 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and the 8.7 2005 Sumatra earthquake, the epicenters of which were around [tpl]convert|300|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from Toba.

==People==

Most of the people who live around Lake Toba are ethnically Bataks. Traditional Batak houses are noted for their distinctive roofs (which curve upwards at each end, as a boat's hull does) and their colorful decor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indonesianmusic.com/batak.htm|title=Batak People|publisher=IndonesianMusic.com[/tpl]

==Flora and fauna==

The flora of the lake includes various types of phytoplankton, emerged macrophytes, floating macrophytes, and submerged macrophytes, while the surrounding countryside is rainforest including areas of Sumatran tropical pine forests on the higher mountainsides.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ilec.or.jp/database/asi/asi-10.html|title=Danau Toba (Lake Toba)|publisher=International Lake Environment Committee[/tpl]
The fauna includes several species of zooplankton and benthic animals. Since the lake is oligotrophic (nutrient-poor), the native fish fauna is relatively scarce, and the only endemics are Rasbora tobana (strictly speaking near-endemic, since also found in some tributary rivers that run into the lake)Lumbantobing, D. N. (2010). Four New Species of the Rasbora trifasciata-Group (Teleostei: Cyprinidae) from Northwestern Sumatra, Indonesia. Copeia 4: 644-670 and Neolissochilus thienemanni, locally known as the Batak fish.Saragih, B., and S. Sunito (2001). Lake Toba: Need for an integrated management system. Lakes & Reservoirs: Research & Management 6(3): 247–251. The latter species is threatened by deforestation (causing siltation), pollution, changes in water level and the numerous fish species that have been introduced to the lake. Other native fishes include species such as Aplocheilus panchax, Nemacheilus pfeifferae, Homaloptera gymnogaster, Channa gachua, Channa striata, Clarias batrachus, Barbonymus gonionotus, Barbonymus schwanenfeldii, Danio albolineatus, Osteochilus vittatus, Puntius binotatus, Rasbora jacobsoni, Tor tambra, Betta imbellis, Betta taeniata and Monopterus albus.FishBase (2012). Species in Toba. Accessed 25 January 2012 Among the many introduced species are Anabas testudineus, Oreochromis mossambicus, Oreochromis niloticus, Ctenopharyngodon idella, Cyprinus carpio, Osphronemus goramy, Trichogaster pectoralis, Trichopodus trichopterus, Poecilia reticulata and Xiphophorus hellerii.
