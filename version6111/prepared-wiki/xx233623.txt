Ironbank is a 4,500-m2, six-level mixed-used (retail and office) development on Karangahape Road, Auckland City, New Zealand. The building also provides a mechanical, automated car stacker for 96 cars, which the robotic system racks in a four-level storage wall.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10606661 |title=Robots park the cars in Ironbank |author=Gibson, Anne |date=2 November 2009 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=5 October 2011[/tpl] It also used a variety of environmentally friendly building facilities, such as reduced energy demands due to a design that can dispense with air conditioning.
The seven-storey building has both been criticised and lauded for looking like "rusting containers", and an architecture critic noted it reminded him of "kindergarten day in a shipping yard", calling it the "most complex and adventurous building" of RTA Studio (designed for Samson Corporation). The building is hoped to achieve 5-star Green Building certification.Iron Bank, Auckland, RTA Studio (from the sharearchitecture.co.nz website. Accessed 2009-10-17.)
In 2009, it received three architecture awards, in the "commercial", "sustainable" and "urban design" categories of the New Zealand Institute of Architects Auckland awards sponsored by the paint company Resene.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=10603071 |title=Ironbank a towering success with three awards |author=Gibson, Anne |date=14 October 2009 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=5 October 2011[/tpl] It then captured second place at the World Architecture Festival, a European award, making it the best-scoring New Zealand entrant ever at the festival, and being praised for "Its sophisticated attitude to the messy urbanity of south-central Auckland".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/auckland-region/news/article.cfm?l_id=117&objectid=10608494 |title=K Rd building named one of world's best |author=Gibson, Anne |date=11 November 2009 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=5 October 2011[/tpl]
It was also mentioned in a The New Zealand Herald series where prominent Aucklanders nominated outstanding Auckland buildings constructed since 2000. Urban designer Ludo Campbell-Reid specifically noted that the building was greater than the sum  of its parts, that it would help re-invigorate Karangahape Road and its backstreets, and that unlike most buildings, it looked better from the back than from the front side.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/auckland-region/news/article.cfm?l_id=117&objectid=10619640 |title=Ironbank: Proud standard-bearer for excellence |date=12 January 2010 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=5 October 2011[/tpl]
