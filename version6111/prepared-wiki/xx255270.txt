==Club career==

Born in Versailles, France, Simão played most of his youth career at S.L. Benfica, having arrived at the age of nine from Grupo Instrução Musical Desportiva Abóboda. On 19 January 2008 he was called to the first team for a Portuguese Cup game against C.D. Feirense, courtesy of manager José Antonio Camacho, and was even picked to both UEFA Cup round-of-16 matches against Getafe CF, not being used however in any of the three contests.
Simão made his professional debuts with C.D. Fátima, on loan, his first match being against C.D. Santa Clara in the 2009–10 season opener in the second division, a 0–1 loss. On 26 September 2009 he scored his first goal for the club, in a 1–1 away draw against Gil Vicente FC.
On 17 June 2010 Simão moved to F.C. Paços de Ferreira, still on loan. He made his top level debut on 14 August in a 1–0 home win against Sporting Clube de Portugal, and only missed five league games (19 starts, 2,051 minutes of action) during the campaign as the team finished in seventh position.
Simão returned to Benfica for 2011–12 but, deemed surplus to requirements by manager Jorge Jesus, he moved to fellow top-divisioner Académica de Coimbra again on loan, on 17 January 2012.Benfica empresta David Simão à Académica (Benfica loans David Simão to Académica); Mais Futebol, 17 January 2012 [tpl]pt icon[/tpl] He scored his first goal for his new club on 26 March, netting from 40 yards in a 1–2 loss at S.C.
