Iserlohn ([tpl]IPA-de|iːzɐˈloːn[/tpl]) is a city in the Märkischer Kreis district, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is the largest city by population and area within the district and the Sauerland region.

==Geography==

Iserlohn is located at the north end of the Sauerland near the Ruhr river.

==History==

The Pancratius church (also called Bauernkirche) was founded in around 985, but the first written document mentioning lon dates only from 1150. In 1237 the Count of the Mark gave Iserlohn municipal rights. In 1975 the city, which had been an urban district before, incorporated the surrounding ex-municipalities of Letmathe, Hennen, Sümmern and Kesbern, and became part of the district "Märkischer Kreis". As a larger mid-sized city, Iserlohn, however, still has a special status as compared to most other municipalities in the district. This means that the city takes on tasks more usually performed by the district (e.g. social and youth affairs) so that in some ways it is comparable to an urban district.
As an important industrial city in the Ruhr region, during the post-WWII era starting in 1953 Canadian and British military under NATO were garrisoned here and in surrounding municipalities (Hemer, where a large Canadian Army housing area was located to house Canadian Army personnel and their families, and Deilinghofen where two of the Canadian Army barracks were located (Fort Prince of Wales and Fort McLeod).  There were also garrisons stationed at Werl and Soest/Bad Sassendorf.
Within Iserlohn itself the Canadian Army had barracks in former tank barracks and renamed the Barracks Fort Beausejour and Fort Qu'Appelle.
After 1970, following the transfer of Canadian troops to the Black Forest Region, these barracks in Iserlohn and Deilinghofen, as well as the barracks located in Werl and Soest, were either transferred to British, back to the Bundeswehr, or converted to civilian use.  The Canadian housing in Hemer (Private Married Quarters or "PMQs") was converted to civilian housing.
A lot of women from Iserlohn married service personnel and left for Canada in the sixties.
