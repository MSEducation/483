Hurt No More is the second studio album by R&B singer and musician Mario Winans, released in 2004.

==Production==

Winans recorded his second album Hurt No More in 2001, 2002 and 2003 in between his busy schedule working with other artists, mostly on Diddy's Bad Boy label. The album is based on stories of love and betrayal. On his website, Winans says: "This record is about relationships, pure and simple. We all have hearts. Sometimes, we have to look deeper into what we're saying and doing to the people we care about." All of the production work and most of the instrumental work on the album was performed by Winans himself.

==Chart Success==

The first single "I Don't Wanna Know" was based on a sample of "Boadicea" by Enya from her 1987 self-titled album.
