==Teaching==

Chen Zhi is self-taught as teacher.Xuefei Yang interviewed by Macer Hall 2008 marked the 50th anniversary of Chen Zhi's teaching career.
His teaching from around the 1990s is such, that based on his students' technical abilities, he is regarded as one of today's top classical guitar teachers (see  Quotations below).
He primarily teaches young students (often ranging in age from 9 to 15) and some follow a formal track linking middle school, high school and conservatory; many reach a high ability at a young age. He stresses memorization and uses games, competition and rewards.
A number of his students, notably Yang Xuefei, Wang Yameng, Su Meng, Li Jie have won international competitions.
While he is well known as a teacher, Chen Zhi is himself not an advanced classical guitar player, and no concert performer. In classical guitar demonstration videos, it is always his students that play; with himself just giving explanations, transmitting basic skills, relating how to approach technical aspects, methodology, etc.

===Phases of teaching===

Chen Zhi notes that the guitar and teaching has been an extensive part of his life (teaching since 1958) and experimented a lot with different guitar technique and approaches. He identifies six different phases of teaching/instrumental approaches (changing various technical ideas, etc.), beginning in the 1950s with very basic rudimentary insufficient technique; through later phases in which he had contact with western concert performers (1980s), and began changing the technique he taught (e.g. with nails, different hand-position), up to the last phase, which stabilized around 1996, or later: when he slowly began to arouse increasing interest in the West, due to the high level of his students. He identifies different students who are representative of the various teaching phases.我的教学感受和心得 (Chen Zhi)
