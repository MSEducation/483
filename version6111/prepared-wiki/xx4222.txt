  [[Sennacherib]] had come, intent on making war against Jerusalem, Hezekiah consulted with his officers and warriors about stopping the flow of the springs outside the city ... for otherwise, they thought, the King of Assyria would come and find water in abundance" ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:2-4|HE[/tpl]).</blockquote> The narratives of the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Testament]] state that Sennacherib [[Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem|besieged Jerusalem]] ([tpl]bibleverse||Isaiah|33:1|HE[/tpl]; [tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|18:17|HE[/tpl]; [tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:9|HE[/tpl]; [tpl]bibleverse||Isaiah|36|HE[/tpl]).

===Death of Sennacherib===

Sennacherib failed to conquer Judah in full before his death.
[tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|19:37|HE[/tpl] says -
 "It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him Sennacherib with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place." 
Assyrian records say that Sennacherib was assassinated in 681 BC (20 years after the 701 BC invasion of Judah).J. D. Douglas, ed., New Bible Dictionary (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1965) 1160. A Neo-Babylonian letter corroborates with the biblical account a sentiment from Sennacherib’s sons to assassinate him, an event Assyriologists have reconstructed as historical. The son Ardi-Mulishi, who is mentioned in the letter as killing anyone who would reveal his conspiracy, successfully murders his father in c. 681 BC,The New Oxford Annotated Bible. 4th ed. New York: Oxford Press, 2010. and was most likely the Adrammelech in 2 Kings, though Sharezer is not known elsewhere.Archaeological Study Bible. Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2005. Print. Assyryologists posit the murder was motivated because Esarhaddon was chosen as heir to the throne instead of Ardi-Mulishi, the next eldest son. Assyrian and Hebrew biblical history corroborate that Esarhaddon ultimately did succeed the throne.

===Hezekiah's illness and death===

The narrative of Hezekiah's sickness and miraculous recovery is found in [tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|20:1|HE[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:24|HE[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Isaiah|38:1|HE[/tpl]. Various ambassadors came to congratulate him on his recovery, among them from Merodach-baladan, the king of Babylon ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:23|HE[/tpl]; 2 Kings 20:12). Hezekiah is also remembered for giving too much information to Baladan, king of Babylon (or perhaps for boasting about his wealth), for which he was confronted by Isaiah the prophet ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|20:12-19|HE[/tpl]).
According to the Talmud, the disease came about because of a dispute between him and Isaiah over who should pay whom a visit and over Hezekiah's refusal to marry and have children.  According to [tpl]bibleverse||Isaiah|38:5|HE[/tpl], Hezekiah lived another 15 more years of life after praying to God. Some Talmudists also considered that it might have come about as a way for Hezekiah to purge his sins or due to his arrogance in assuming his righteousness.[tpl]cite web|title=Hezekiah|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7668-hezekiah|work=Hezekiah, Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=15 April 2012[/tpl]

==Extra-Biblical records==

Extra-Biblical sources do much more for us than give us a pan-Mid Eastern picture into which we contextualize Hezekiah: there are extra-Biblical sources that specify Hezekiah by name, along with his reign and influence. “Historiographically, his reign is noteworthy for the convergence of a variety of biblical sources and diverse extrabiblical evidence often bearing on the same events. Significant data concerning Hezekiah appear in the Deuteronomistic History, the Chronicler, Isaiah, Assyrian annals and reliefs, Israelite epigraphy, and, increasingly, stratigraphy”.“Hezekiah.” The Anchor Bible Dictionary. 1992. Print. Archaeologist Amihai Mazar calls the tensions between Assyria and Judah “one of the best-documented events of the Iron Age” (172). Hezekiah’s story is one of the best to cross-reference with the rest of the Mid Eastern world’s historical documents.

===Archaeological record===

A lintel inscription, found over the doorway of a tomb, has been ascribed to his secretary, Shebnah [tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|18:18|HE[/tpl]).
LMLK store jars along the border with Assyria “demonstrate careful preparations to counter Sennacherib’s likely route of invasion” and show “a notable degree of royal control of towns and cities which would facilitate Hezekiah’s destruction of rural sacrificial sites and his centralization of worship in Jerusalem”. Evidence suggests they were used throughout his 29-year reign (Grena, 2004, p. 338).
There are some Bullae from sealed documents that may have belonged to Hezekiah himself (Grena, 2004, p. 26, Figs. 9 and 10). There are also some that name his servants (ah-vah-deem in Hebrew, ayin-bet-dalet-yod-mem). However, they are all from the antiquities market and subject to authentication disputes (see Biblical archaeology).

====Increase in the power of Judah====

According to the work of archaeologists and philologists, the reign of Hezekiah saw a notable increase in the power of the Judean state. There were increases in literacy and in the production of literary works.  The massive construction of the Broad Wall was made during his reign, the city was enlarged to accommodate a large influx, and population increased in Jerusalem up to 25,000, “five times the population under Solomon.”  Archaeologist Amihai Mazar explains, “Jerusalem was a virtual city-state where the majority of the state’s population was concentrated,” in comparison to the rest of Judah’s cities (167).Finkelstein, Israel and Amihai Mazar. The Quest for the Historical Israel: Debating Archaeology and the History of Early Israel. Leiden: Brill, 2007 Archaeologist Israel Finkelstein says, “The key phenomenon—which cannot be explained solely against the background of economic prosperity—was the sudden growth of the population of Jerusalem in particular, and of Judah in general” (153). He says the cause of this growth must be a large influx of Israelites fleeing from the Assyrian destruction of the northern state. It is “the only reasonable way to explain this unprecedented demographic development” (154). This, according to Finkelstein, set the stage for motivations to compile and reconcile Hebrew history into a text at that time (157). Mazar questions this explanation, since, he argues, it is “no more than an educated guess” (167).

====Siloam inscription====

Hezekiah's Siloam Tunnel was chiseled through 533 meters (1,750 feet) of solid rock  in order to provide Jerusalem underground access to the waters of the Gihon Spring or Siloam Pool, which lay outside the city.
The Siloam Inscription from the Siloam Tunnel is now in the Istanbul Archeological Museum. It “commemorates the dramatic moment when the two original teams of tunnelers, digging with picks from opposite ends of the tunnel, met each other” (564). It is “one of the most important ancient Hebrew inscriptions ever discovered.” Finkelstein and Mazar cite this tunnel as an example of Jerusalem’s impressive state-level power at the time.
Archeologists like William G. Dever have pointed at archaeological evidence for the iconoclasm during the period of Hezekiah's reign. The central cult room of the temple at Arad (a royal Judean fortress) was deliberately and carefully dismantled, "with the altars and massebot" concealed "beneath a Str. 8 plaster floor". This stratum correlates with the late 8th century; Dever concludes that "the deliberate dismantling of the temple and its replacement by another structure in the days of Hezekiah is an archeological fact. I see no reason for skepticism here."Dever, William G. (2005) "Did God Have a Wife?  Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient Israel" (Eerdmans), pp. 174, 175.

====Lachish relief====

Under Rehoboam, Lachish became the second most important city of the kingdom of Judah. During the revolt of king Hezekiah against Assyria, it was captured by Sennacherib despite determined resistance (see Siege of Lachish).
As the Lachish relief attests, Sennacherib began his siege of the city of Lachish in 701 BC.“Hezekiah.” The Family Bible Encyclopedia. 1972. Print. The Lachish Relief graphically depicts the battle, and the defeat of the city, including Assyrian archers marching up a ramp and Judahites pierced through on mounted stakes. “The reliefs on these slabs” discovered in the Assyrian palace at Nineveh “originally formed a single, continuous work, measuring 8 feet...tall by 80 feet...long, which wrapped around the room” (559). Visitors “would have been impressed not only by the magnitude of the artwork itself but also by the magnificent strength of the Assyrian war machine.”

====Sennacherib's Prism of Nineveh====

Sennacherib's Prism was found buried in the foundations of the Nineveh palace. It was written in cuneiform, the Mesopotamian form of writing of the day. The prism records the conquest of 46 strong towns James B. Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Related to the Old Testament (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1965) 287-288. and “uncountable smaller places,” along with the siege of Jerusalem where Sennacherib says he just “shut him up...like a bird in a cage,” subsequently enforcing a larger tribute upon him. There is no mention that Sennacherib failed to take Jerusalem. In Assyrian history, “prisms were meant for future kings to read, so they never reported any defeats or anything bad about the king” (301).Zondervan Handbook to the Bible. Grand Rapids: Lion Publishing, 1999. Understandably, there is no account of the great defeat outside the walls of Jerusalem that is recorded in the Hebrew Testament, because it would have reflected poorly on the Assyrian king. One theory posits that defeat was caused by “possibly an outbreak of the bubonic plague” (303).

===Other records===

The Talmud (Bava Batra 15a) credits Hezekiah with overseeing the compilation of the biblical books of Isaiah, Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes.
According to Jewish tradition, the victory over the Assyrians and Hezekiah's return to health happened at the same time, the first night of Passover.
The Greek historian, Herodotus (c. 484 BC – c. 425 BC), wrote of the invasion and acknowledges many Assyrian deaths, which he claims were the result of a plague of mice. The Jewish historian, Josephus, followed the writings of Herodotus. These historians record Sennacherib’s failure to take Jerusalem is “uncontested

==Chronological interpretation==

Understanding the biblically recorded sequence of events in Hezekiah’s life as chronological or not is critical to the contextual interpretation of his reign. According to scholar Stephen L. Harris, chapter 20 of 2 Kings does not follow the events of chapters 18 and 19 (161).Harris, Stephen L. Understanding the Bible. 8th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011. Rather, the Babylonian envoys precede the Assyrian invasion and siege. Chapter 20 would have been added during the exile, and Harris says it “evidently took place before Sennacherib’s invasion” when Hezekiah was “trying to recruit Babylon as an ally against Assyria.”  Consequently, “Hezekiah ends his long reign impoverished and ruling over only a tiny scrap of his former domain.” Likewise, The Archaeological Study Bible says, “The presence of these riches” that Hezekiah shows to the Babylonians “indicates that this event took place before Hezekiah’s payment of tribute to Sennacherib in 701 B.C.” (564). Again, “Though the king’s illness and the subsequent Babylonian mission are described at the end of the accounts of his reign, they must have occurred before the war with Assyria. Thus, Isaiah’s chastening of Hezekiah is due to his alliances made with other countries during the Assyrian conflict for insurance, if you will. To a reader who interprets the chapters chronologically, it would appear that Hezekiah ended his reign at a climax, but with a scholarly analysis, his end would contrarily be interpreted as a long fall from where he began.

==Other chronological notes==

There has been considerable academic debate about the actual dates of reigns of the Israelite kings. Scholars have endeavored to synchronize the chronology of events referred to in the Hebrew Bible with those derived from other external sources. In the case of Hezekiah, scholars have noted that the apparent inconsistencies are resolved by accepting the evidence that Hezekiah, like his predecessors for four generations in the kings of Judah, had a coregency with his father, and this coregency began in 729 BC.
As an example of the reasoning that finds inconsistencies in calculations when coregencies are a priori ruled out, [tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|18:10|NIV[/tpl] dates the fall of Samaria (the Northern Kingdom) to the 6th year of Hezekiah's reign. William F. Albright has dated the fall of the Kingdom of Israel to 721 BC, while E. R. Thiele calculates the date as 723 BC.Edwin R. Thiele, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings (3rd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983) pp. 134, 217. If Abright's or Thiele's dating are correct, then Hezekiah's reign would begin in either 729 or 727 BC. On the other hand, [tpl]bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|18:13|NIV[/tpl] states that Sennacherib invaded Judah in the 14th year of Hezekiah's reign. Dating based on Assyrian records date this invasion to 701 BC, and Hezekiah's reign would therefore begin in 716/715 BC.Leslie McFall, “A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,” Bibliotheca Sacra 148 (1991) p. 33. (Link)[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot[/tpl] This dating would be confirmed by the account of Hezekiah's illness in chapter 20, which immediately follows Sennacherib's departure ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|20|NIV[/tpl]). This would date his illness to Hezekiah's 14th year, which is confirmed by Isaiah's statement ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|20:6|NIV[/tpl]) that he will live fifteen more years (29-15=14). As shown below, these problems are all addressed by scholars who make reference to the ancient Near Eastern practice of coregency.
Following the approach of Wellhausen, another set of calculations shows it is probable that Hezekiah did not ascend the throne before 722 BC. By Albright's calculations, Jehu's initial year is 842 BC; and between it and Samaria's destruction the Books of Kings give the total number of the years the kings of Israel ruled as 143 7/12, while for the kings of Judah the number is 165. This discrepancy, amounting in the case of Judah to 45 years (165-120), has been accounted for in various ways; but every one of those theories must allow that Hezekiah's first six years fell before 722 BC. (That Hezekiah began to reign before 722 BC, however, is entirely consistent with the principle that the Ahaz/Hezekiah coregency began in 729 BC.) Nor is it clearly known how old Hezekiah was when called to the throne, although [tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|18:2|NIV[/tpl] states he was twenty-five years of age. His father died at the age of thirty-six ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|16:2|NIV[/tpl]); it is not likely that Ahaz at the age of eleven should have had a son. Hezekiah's own son Manasseh ascended the throne twenty-nine years later, at the age of twelve. This places his birth in the seventeenth year of his father's reign, or gives Hezekiah's age as forty-two, if he was twenty-five at his ascension. It is more probable that Ahaz was twenty-one or twenty-five when Hezekiah was born (and suggesting an error in the text), and that the latter was thirty-two at the birth of his son and successor, Manasseh.
Since Albright and Friedman, several scholars have explained these dating problems on the basis of a coregency between Hezekiah and his father Ahaz between 729 and 716/715 BC. Assyriologists and Egyptologists recognize that coregency was a practice both in Assyria and Egypt,William J. Murnane, Ancient Egyptian Coregencies (Chicago: The Oriental Institute, 1977).J. D. Douglas, ed., New Bible Dictionary (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1965) p. 1160. After noting that coregencies were only used sporadically in the northern kingdom (Israel), Nadav Na'aman writes, 
 In the kingdom of Judah, on the other hand, the nomination of a co-regent was the common procedure, beginning from David who, before his death, elevated his son Solomon to the throneWhen taking into account the permanent nature of the co-regency in Judah from the time of Joash, one may dare to conclude that dating the co-regencies accurately is indeed the key for solving the problems of biblical chronology in the eighth century B.C."Nadav Na'aman, "Historical and Chronological Notes on the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah in the Eighth Century BC" Vetus Testamentum 36 (1986) p. 91. 
Among the numerous scholars who have recognized the coregency between Ahaz and Hezekiah are Kenneth Kitchen in his various writings,See Kitchen's chronology in New Bible Dictionary p. 220. Leslie McFall,Leslie McFall, "Translation Guide" p.42. and Jack Finegan.Jack Finegan, Handbook of Biblical Chronology (rev. ed.; Peabody MA: Hendrickson, 1998) p. 246. McFall, in his 1991 article, argues that if 729 BC (that is, the Judean regnal year beginning in Tishri of 729) is taken as the start of the Ahaz/Hezekiah coregency, and 716/715 BC as the date of the death of Ahaz, then all the extensive chronological data for Hezekiah and his contemporaries in the late eighth century BC are in harmony. Further, McFall found that no textual emendations are required among the numerous dates, reign lengths, and synchronisms given in the Hebrew Testament for this period.Leslie McFall, "Translation Guide" pp. 4-45 (Link).[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot[/tpl] In contrast, those who do not accept the Ancient Near Eastern principle of coregencies require multiple emendations of the Scriptural text, and there is no general agreement on which texts should be emended, nor is there any consensus among these scholars on the resultant chronology for the eighth century BC. This is in contrast with the general consensus among those who accept the Biblical and near Eastern practice of coregencies that Hezekiah was installed as coregent with his father Ahaz in 729 BC, and the synchronisms of 2 Kings 18 must be measured from that date, whereas the synchronisms to Sennacherib are measured from the sole reign starting in 716/715 BC. The two synchronisms to Hoshea of Israel in 2 Kings 18 are then in exact agreement with the dates of Hoshea's reign that can be determined from Assyrian sources, as is the date of Samaria's fall as stated in 2 Kings 18:10. An analogous situation of two ways of measurement, both equally valid,  is encountered in the dates given for Jehoram of Israel, whose first year is synchronized to the 18th year of the sole reign of Jehoshaphat of Judah in 2 Kings 3:1 (853/852 BC), but his reign is also reckoned according to another method as starting in the second year of the coregency of Jehoshaphat and his son Jehoram of Judah (2 Kings 1:17); both methods refer to the same calendrical year.
Scholars who accept the principle of coregencies note that abundant evidence for their use is found in the biblical material itself.Thiele, Mysterious Numbers chapter 3, "Coregencies and Rival Reigns." The agreement of scholarship built on these principles with both biblical and secular texts was such that the Thiele/McFall chronology was accepted as the best chronology for the kingdom period in Jack Finegan's encyclopedic Handbook of Biblical Chronology.Jack Finegan, Handbook of Biblical Chronology p. 246.
