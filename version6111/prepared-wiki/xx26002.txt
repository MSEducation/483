The National Palace Museum ([tpl]zh|t=國立故宮博物院|first=t|s=国立故宫博物院|p=Guólì Gùgōng Bówùyuàn[/tpl]) is an antique museum in Shilin, Taipei, Taiwan. It is one of the national museums of the Republic of China, and has a permanent collection of more than 696,000 pieces of ancient Chinese artifacts and artworks, making it one of the largest in the world. The collection encompasses over 8,000 years of Chinese history from the Neolithic age to the late Qing Dynasty.[tpl]cite news |title=National art collection evokes hard history |author=Peter Enav |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/arts-&-leisure/2009/05/12/207758/p2/National-art.htm |agency=AP|newspaper=The China Post |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2012-06-16[/tpl] Most of the collection are high quality pieces collected by China's ancient emperors.
The National Palace Museum and the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City in Beijing, People's Republic of China, share the same roots. They split in two as a result of the Chinese Civil War.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmes/newshour/news/story/2007/02/070208_taipei_museum.shtml |title= Taipei's National Palace Museum |accessdate= 2008-06-04 |publisher=BBC[/tpl] In English, the institution in Taipei is distinguished from the one in Beijing by the additional "National" designation. In common usage in Chinese, the institution in Taipei is known as the "Taipei Gugong" (臺北故宮), while that in Beijing is known as the "Beijing Gugong" (北京故宮).

==History==

===Establishment in Beijing and relocation===

The National Palace Museum was originally established as the Palace Museum in Beijing's Forbidden City on 10 October 1925, shortly after the expulsion of Puyi,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/about/chronology.htm |title=Chronology of Events |accessdate= 2008-06-04 |publisher= National Palace Museum[/tpl][tpl]Cite web |title=Tradition & Continuity |url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/about/tradition.htm |publisher=National Palace Museum|accessdate=2012-06-17[/tpl] the last emperor of China, from the Forbidden City by warlord Feng Yü-hsiang. The articles in the museum consisted of the valuables of the former Imperial family.
In 1931, shortly after the Mukden Incident Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government ordered the museum to make preparations to evacuate its most valuable pieces out of the city to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. As a result, from 6 February to 15 May 1933, the Palace Museum's 13,491 crates and 6,066 crates of objects from the Exhibition Office of Ancient Artifacts, the Yiheyuan and the Hanlin Yuan Imperial Academy were moved in five groups to Shanghai.[tpl]Citation|last=Chiang|first=Fu-tsung|title=The Transfer of the National Palace Museum Collection to Taiwan and Its Subsequent Installation|journal=The National Palace Museum Quarterly|volume=14|issue =1|year=1979|pages=1–16, 37–43|language=English, Chinese[/tpl] In 1936, the collection was moved to Nanjing after the construction of the  storage in the Taoist monastery Chaotian Palace was complete.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/exh96/orientation/index3_2_en.html|title=The National Palace Museum: Timeline of the NPM|publisher=National Palace Museum|accessdate=2010-12-20[/tpl] As the Imperial Japanese Army advanced farther inland during the Second Sino-Japanese War, which merged into the greater conflict of World War II, the collection was moved westward via three routes to several places including Anshun and Leshan until the surrender of Japan in 1945. In 1947, it was shipped back to the Nanjing warehouse.

===Evacuation to Taiwan===

The Chinese Civil War resumed following the surrender of the Japanese, ultimately resulting in Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's decision to evacuate the arts to Taiwan. When the fighting worsened in 1948 between the Communist and Nationalist armies, the Palace Museum and other five institutions made the decision to send some of the most prized items to Taiwan.[tpl]Cite book |title=中華文物播遷記 |last=Hang |first=Li-wu |year=1983 |edition=2 |publisher=The Commercial Press |location=Taipei  |language=Chinese |accessdate=14 September 2012[/tpl] Hang Li-wu, later director of the museum, supervised the transport of some of the collection in three groups from Nanjing to the harbor in Keelung, Taiwan between December 1948 and February 1949. By the time the items arrived in Taiwan, the Communist army had already seized control of the Palace Museum collection so not all of the collection could be sent to Taiwan. A total of 2,972 crates of artifacts from the Forbidden City moved to Taiwan only accounted for 22% of the crates originally transported south, although the pieces represented some of the very best of the collection.
The collection from the Palace Museum, the Preparatory Office of the National Central Museum, the National Central Library, and the National Beiping Library was stored in a railway warehouse in Yangmei following transport across the Taiwan Strait and was later moved to the storage in cane sugar mill near Taichung. In 1949, the Executive Yuan created the Joint Managerial Office, for the Palace Museum, the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum and the Central Library to oversee the organization of the collection. For security reasons, the Joint Managerial Office chose the mountain village of Beikou, located in Wufeng, Taichung as the new storage site for the collection in the same year. In the following year, the collection stored in cane sugar mill was transported to the new site in Beikou.
With the Central Library's reinstatement in 1955, the collection from the Beiping Library was simultaneously incorporated into the Central Library. The Joint Managerial Office of the National Palace Museum and the Preparatory Office of the National Central Museum stayed in Beikou for another ten years. During the decade, the Office obtained a grant from the Asia Foundation to construct a small-scale exhibition hall in the spring of 1956.[tpl]Citation|title=A Brief History of the National Palace Museum|journal=The National Palace Museum Quarterly|volume=1|issue =1|year=1966|pages=29–32, 85–89|language=English, Chinese[/tpl] The exhibition hall, opened in March 1957, was divided into four galleries in which it was possible to exhibit more than 200 items.
In the autumn of 1960, the Office received a grant of NT$ 32 million from AID. The Republic of China (ROC) government also contributed more than NT$ 30 million to establish a special fund for the construction of a museum in the Taipei suburb of Waishuanxi. The construction of the museum in Waishuanxi was completed in August 1965. The new museum site was christened the "Chung-Shan Museum" in honor of the founding father of the ROC, Sun Yat-sen, and first opened to the public on the centenary of Sun Yat-sen's birthday. Since then, the museum in Taipei has managed, conserved and exhibited the collections of the Palace Museum and the Preparatory Office of the National Central Museum.
During the 1960s and 1970s, the National Palace Museum was used by the Kuomintang to support its claim that the Republic of China was the sole legitimate government of all China, in that it was the sole preserver of traditional Chinese culture amid social change and the Cultural Revolution in mainland China, and tended to emphasize Chinese nationalism.
The People's Republic of China (PRC) government has long said that the collection was stolen and that it legitimately belongs in China, but Taiwan has defended its collection as a necessary act to protect the pieces from destruction, especially during the Cultural Revolution. However, relations regarding this treasure have warmed in recent years and the Palace Museum in Beijing has agreed to lend relics to the National Palace Museum for exhibitions since 2009.[tpl]cite news |title=China to lend treasures to Taiwan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7892178.stm |publisher=BBC |date=2009-02-16 |accessdate=2012-06-16[/tpl] The Palace Museum curator Zheng Xinmiao have said that the artifacts in both mainland and Taiwan museums are "China's cultural heritage jointly owned by people across the Taiwan Strait."[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/world/asia/02iht-auction.3.20539588.html |title=Top bid on disputed Yves Saint Laurent bronzes was a protest from China |author=Mark McDonald |date=2 March 2009 |work=The New York Times[/tpl]

===Trivia===

A number of Chinese artifacts dating from the Tang Dynasty and Song Dynasty, some of which had been owned by Emperor Zhenzong, were excavated and then came into the hands of the Kuomintang General Ma Hongkui, who refused to publicize the findings. Among the artifacts were a white marble tablet from the Tang Dynasty, gold nails, and bands made out of metal. It was not until after Ma died that his wife went to Taiwan in 1971 from America to bring the artifacts to Chiang Kai-shek, who turned them over to the National Palace Museum.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0UzrAAAAMAAJ&q=in+1971,+his+widow+took+them+from+America+to+Chiang+Kai-shek+in+Taiwan.+They+were+later+acquired+by+the+National+Palace&dq=in+1971,+his+widow+took+them+from+America+to+Chiang+Kai-shek+in+Taiwan.+They+were+later+acquired+by+the+National+Palace&hl=en&ei=414OTZT6GIL_8AaO8p2ADg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA|title=China archaeology and art digest, Volume 3, Issue 4|author=|year=2000|publisher=Art Text (HK) Ltd.|location=|page=354|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2010-11-28[/tpl]

==Overseas exhibitions==

Due to fears that the artifacts may be impounded and be claimed by China due to the controversial political status of Taiwan, the museum does not conduct exhibitions in mainland China. Since the museum's 1965 establishment in Taipei, the National Palace Museum has only made four large overseas exhibitions in countries which have passed laws to prevent judicial seizure of the treasures. The past four overseas events were to the United States in 1996, France in 1998, Germany in 2003 and Austria in 2008.[tpl]Cite news |title=New Japan law opens way for exhibits |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/foreign-affairs/2011/03/26/296109/New-Japan.htm |date=2011-03-26 |agency=Central News Agency |work=The China Post[/tpl] The next major overseas exhibition is scheduled to be held in Tokyo National Museum and Kyushu National Museum in 2014 after the completion of the legislative process in Japan.[tpl]Cite news |title=Taiwan museum to lend Chinese antiquities for exhibitions in Japan in 2014 |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120824b7.html |date=24 August 2012 |author=Kyodo News |work=The Japan Times[/tpl]
