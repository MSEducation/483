==Racing career==

===Beginnings===

When he was four-years-old, Gordon rode a BMX bike that his stepfather bought for him,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gordonline.com/bio.html |title=Jeff Gordon Biographical Information |publisher=Gordonline.com |accessdate=August 22, 2012[/tpl] but began racing at the age of five, racing quarter midgets. The Roy Hayer Memorial Race Track (previously the Cracker Jack Track) in Rio Linda, California is noted as the first track Gordon ever competed on. By the age of six Gordon had won 35 main events and set five track records.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jeffgordon.com/about_jeff/default.sps?itype=12223|title = Jeff Gordon's Official fan site Bio[/tpl] At age 12, Gordon became bored with cars and decided to start a career in waterskiing before switching back to driving one year later.[tpl]cite web|last=McGee|first=Ryan|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/columns/story?columnist=mcgee_ryan&id=3500780|title=Indianapolis Motor Speedway is Jeff Gordon's personal playground|publisher=ESPN|date=July 24, 2008|accessdate=December 27, 2013[/tpl] When he was 13, Gordon took an interest in the [tpl]convert|650|hp[/tpl] sprint cars. Gordon and his family had to overcome an insurance hurdle. The minimum age for driving the sprint cars was 16, and his persistence paid off with an all Florida speed weeks. Supporting his career choice, Gordon's family moved from Vallejo, California, to Pittsboro, Indiana, where there were more opportunities for younger racers. Before the age of 18, Gordon had already won three short-track races and was awarded USAC Midget Car Racing Rookie of the Year in 1989. That season was highlighted by winning Night Before the 500 midget car race on the day before the Indianapolis 500. In 1990, Gordon won his second consecutive Night Before the 500, the Hut Hundred, and the Belleville Midget Nationals on his way to winning the USAC national Midget title.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worthyofhonor.com/|title=Tappett, Humphrey, Gordon & Doty join "Hall of Fame" |date=August 24, 2008|publisher=National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame|accessdate=September 6, 2009[/tpl]  In 1991, Gordon captured the USAC Silver Crown, and at the age of 20 became the youngest driver to win the season championship. He also won the 4 Crown Nationals midget car race that season. In his midget car career between 1989 and 1992, he finished in the Top 3 in 22 of 40 USAC midget car events. In the early 1990s, Gordon expressed interest in IndyCar racing, but was not able to find a ride due to low funding. However, former Formula One driver Jackie Stewart offered Gordon a test drive in Europe, in what Gordon assumed was Formula Three or Formula 3000; Gordon did not perform the test due to being in contact with NASCAR.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2004/6/1745.html|title=NASCAR’s Jeff Gordon on Formula One racing|work=Formula One|date=June 17, 2004|accessdate=February 19, 2014[/tpl]

====Busch Series====

In 1990 Gordon met Hugh Connerty, who owned some Hooters restaurants and was also a partner in Outback Steakhouse. Connerty secured some sponsorship for a car through Outback, and they tested for the last few Busch Grand National races left in 1990. Ray Evernham was called in to work with Gordon in his stock car debut. His first Busch race came on October 20, 1990 at Rockingham Speedway in the AC-Delco 200. Gordon drove the No. 67 Outback Steakhouse Pontiac for Connerty. Gordon ran the second fastest lap during qualifying and started on the outside of the front row of the field. Gordon would however, get involved in a wreck on lap 33. He ended up with a 39th-place finish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/6937349/nascar-jeff-gordon-greatness-was-seen-early-staying-late|title=Gordon's greatness is enduring|last=Newton|first=David|date=September 7, 2011|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=August 19, 2013[/tpl]
In 1991 and 1992, Gordon went on to the Busch Series driving Ford Thunderbirds for Bill Davis Racing. In his first year as a Busch driver he won Rookie of the Year. In 1992, Gordon set a NASCAR record by capturing 11 poles in one season. He was sponsored by Carolina Ford Dealers in 1991 and Baby Ruth in 1992.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jeffgordon.com/aboutjeff/|title=Jeff Gordon|work=Jeff Gordon[/tpl]
In 1999, Gordon along with Cup crew chief Evernham formed Gordon/Evernham Motorsports (GEM) in the Busch Series with Gordon and Rick Hendrick's son Ricky Hendrick as drivers, the Rainbow Warriors as pit crew and Patrick Donahue as crew chief.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gordonline.com/busch/bio.html|title=Team Bio|work=Gordon Online|accessdate=July 28, 2013[/tpl] The co-owned team received a full sponsorship from Pepsi and ran six races with Gordon as driver and Evernham as crew chief. GEM only survived one year as Evernham left Hendrick Motorsports, citing tension between him and the team,[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/news/1999/09/24/evernham_position/index.html|title=Evernham leaving Gordon, Hendrick|work=CNN Sports Illustrated|date=September 24, 1999|accessdate=July 28, 2013[/tpl] ending one of the most dominant driver/crew-chief combinations in NASCAR history. Gordon extended his Busch experiment one more year, through 2000 as co-owner, with Rick Hendrick buying Evernham's half, and GEM becoming JG Motorsports. In two seasons, Gordon won twice, in 1999 at the inaugural Busch race[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/news/1999/10/30/gordon_phoenix_ap/|title=Shut out|work=CNN Sports Illustrated|date=October 30, 1999|accessdate=July 28, 2013[/tpl] at Phoenix,[tpl]cite web|last=Callahan|first=Terry|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/date/19991106/news002654.html|title=Jeff Gordon wins first Busch Series race at Phoenix|publisher=The Auto Channel|date=November 6, 1999|accessdate=August 23, 2013[/tpl] and 2000 at Homestead.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/news/2000/11/11/gordon_wins_ap/|title=The spoiler|work=CNN Sports Illustrated|date=November 11, 2000|accessdate=July 28, 2013[/tpl]

====Sprint Cup Series====

In 1992, Rick Hendrick watched Gordon compete in a Busch race at Atlanta, and two days later, signed him to Hendrick Motorsports.[tpl]cite news|last=Siano|first=Joseph|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/08/sports/auto-racing-gordon-hears-the-roar-of-the-hometown-fans.html?ref=jeffgordon|title=Gordon Hears the Roar Of the Hometown Fans|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 8, 1994|accessdate=July 27, 2013[/tpl] Gordon made his Winston Cup debut in the 1992 Hooters 500 at Atlanta, the last race of that season, and finished 31st after crashing;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1992_Hooters_500/W|title=1992 Hooters 500|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=September 2, 2013[/tpl] in addition to the race being Richard Petty's final race in NASCAR and the championship battle among six drivers (eventually won by Alan Kulwicki by virtue of his second-place finish in the race), this was Gordon's first start in the No. 24 DuPont Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports that he has driven for his entire Cup Series career.
Gordon began driving the No. 24 full-time in the 1993 Winston Cup season, with Ray Evernham as his first crew chief. Gordon started his rookie season by winning a Daytona 500 qualifying race,[tpl]cite web|last=Rodman|first=Dave|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2011/09/06/jgordon-85-victories-highlights.html|title=Highlights on the road to 85 Cup Series victories|publisher=NASCAR|date=September 6, 2011|accessdate=July 1, 2013[/tpl] which was followed by a fifth-place finish in his first Daytona 500. He eventually won the Rookie of the Year award, and finished 14th in points. Gordon's success in the sport reshaped the paradigm and eventually gave younger drivers an opportunity to compete in NASCAR.  However, during the 1993 season, many doubted Gordon's ability to compete at such a level at such a young age because of his tendency to push the cars too hard and crash. His last-place finish at the 1993 First Union 400 was a firm example of this theory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1993_First_Union_400/W|title=1993 First Union 400|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=February 23, 2014[/tpl] He was given the nickname "Wonder Boy" by Dale Earnhardt,[tpl]cite web|first=Ed |last=Hinton |url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/8209109/nascar-dale-earnhardt-jr-high-hopes-indy |title=NASCAR – Dale Earnhardt Jr. has high hopes for Indy – ESPN |publisher=ESPN |date=July 28, 2012 |accessdate=August 6, 2012[/tpl] and his crew was called the "Rainbow Warriors".[tpl]cite web|last=Shaffer |first=Jan |url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/brickyard400/news/show/44127-and-39-rainbow-warriorsand-39-helped-gordon-make-history-at-brickyard/ |title='Rainbow Warriors' Helped Gordon Make History at Brickyard – Brickyard 400 |publisher=Indianapolis Motor Speedway |date=July 19, 2011 |accessdate=August 6, 2012[/tpl]

=====1994=====

In 1994, Gordon opened the season with a 4th-place finish in the Daytona 500,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1994_Daytona_500/W|title=1994 Daytona 500|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=August 9, 2013[/tpl] and in the next nine races, recorded two top tens at Richmond and Atlanta. However, Gordon also had five finishes outside the top 30, though he was able to rebound from his 37th-place finish at Sears Point Raceway[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/drivdet/gordoje01/1994/W|title=1994 NASCAR Winston Cup Results|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=August 9, 2013[/tpl] by collecting his first career victory at the Charlotte Motor Speedway in the Coca-Cola 600 from the pole, the longest race on the NASCAR circuit after Gordon decided to take two tires on a green flag pit stop instead of four,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/photos/2013/12/19/Hendrick-Motorsports-celebrates-Underdog-Day#|title=Hendrick Motorsports celebrates Underdog Day|work=Hendrick Motorsports|accessdate=December 20, 2013[/tpl] and was able to hold off Rusty Wallace by 3.91 seconds.[tpl]cite web|last=Spencer|first=Reid|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2009-05-19/coca-cola-600-memories-1994-jeff-gordons-1st-win|title=Coca-Cola 600 memories: 1994, Jeff Gordon's 1st win|publisher=Sporting News|date=May 19, 2009|accessdate=July 19, 2013[/tpl] Afterwards, Gordon scored three top tens at Pocono and Daytona, followed by a popular hometown victory at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in the inaugural Brickyard 400, passing Ernie Irvan for the lead late in the race when Irvan cut down a tire.[tpl]cite web | last =Christie  | first =Toby   | year = 2010 | url =http://rubbingsracing.com/rubbingsracingWP/2010/07/24/nascar-flashback-1994-brickyard-400-the-inaugural/  | title =NASCAR Flashback Brickyard 400 Inaugural  | accessdate =June 9, 2010 | quote =[/tpl] After Indianapolis, Gordon recorded top tens at Watkins Glen International, North Wilkesboro Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway.

=====1995–2001=====

In 1995, Gordon had a rough start in the Daytona 500, finishing 22nd after starting 4th. The following week at Rockingham, Gordon won the pole with a lap speed of [tpl]convert|157.620|mph|km/h[/tpl], breaking the previous track record of [tpl]convert|157.099|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] set by Ricky Rudd.[tpl]cite news|author=Associated Press|url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/MOTOR-SPORTS-Gordon-Sets-Record-At-Rockingham-3043392.php|title=MOTOR SPORTS / Gordon Sets Record At Rockingham Track|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=February 25, 1995|accessdate=July 27, 2013[/tpl] Gordon eventually won the race, leading a race high 329 laps. At Richmond, Gordon clinched the pole, but a fuel pump ended his day, finishing 36th. A week later, Gordon won at Atlanta, followed by his third pole of the season at Darlington, but crashed. Gordon won his third race of the year at Bristol, followed by another pole at North Wilkesboro. He won his fifth pole at Charlotte, but after the race, NASCAR officials found unapproved wheel hubs on Gordon's car, and fined the team $60,000 while placing Ray Evernham on probation indefinitely.[tpl]cite news|last=Siano|first=Joe|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/16/sports/auto-racing-from-wonder-boy-to-leader.html?ref=jeffgordon|title=From Wonder Boy to Leader|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 16, 1995|accessdate=July 27, 2013[/tpl] Gordon later won four more poles during the season (Dover, Michigan, Indianapolis, Martinsville), along with winning at Daytona, New Hampshire, Darlington and Dover.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/drivdet/gordoje01/1995/W|title=1995 NASCAR Winston Cup Results|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=July 27, 2013[/tpl] The results during the season gave him a 300-point lead over Dale Earnhardt, and Gordon won his first career Winston Cup championship. The team's consistency was much better as well, having 3 DNF's in 1995, compared to 21 in his previous two seasons combined.
Gordon got off to a rocky start in 1996, but rebounded to win ten races, the series high. The 24 team collected wins at Richmond, Darlington (winning both the spring event and the Southern 500), Bristol, Dover (winning both events of the season), Pocono, Talladega, Martinsville, and North Wilkesboro (winning the final official NASCAR event at the track).[tpl]cite web|last=Perski|first=Rick|url=http://www.speedwaydigest.com/index.php/news/sprint-cup-series-news/item/7483-today-in-history-the-final-nascar-sanctioned-race-was-run-at-north-wilkesboro-speedway|title=Today in History: The final NASCAR sanctioned race was run at North Wilkesboro Speedway|work=Speedway Digest|date=September 29, 2012[/tpl] This would start a three-year streak of winning double digit races.

2000 saw Gordon enter his first campaign with Robbie Loomis as crew chief. Loomis had been with Petty Enterprises for years prior. The team struggled as the rebuilding process went on. Gordon scored his first victory of 2000 at Talladega in the spring event,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.talladegasuperspeedway.com/Articles/2009/01/A-Look-Back-In-Talladega-History-Jeff-Gordons-Talladega-Career.aspx|title=A Look Back In Talladega History: Jeff Gordon's Talladega Career|work=Talladega Superspeedway|date=January 30, 2009|accessdate=July 28, 2013[/tpl] winning his 50th career victory in the series.

Gordon finished the season 9th in points.
Many people questioned Gordon's ability to win championships without Evernham, especially after Gordon's 9th-place points finish in 2000. Gordon answered those doubts in 2001 by winning six races beginning at Las Vegas. In May, at The Winston, rain caused the track to become slick, which led to Gordon spinning in turn 2 on the first lap, and was t-boned on the driver's side by Michael Waltrip. However, NASCAR permitted drivers who had crashed to use their backup cars, and Gordon would win the event, tying Dale Earnhardt with three wins in the All-Star Race.[tpl]cite web|last=Fish|first=Mike|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/2001/cocacola600/news/2001/05/19/start_winston/|title=Rainy crashfest decimates start of The Winston|publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated|date=May 19, 2001|accessdate=April 14, 2014[/tpl] Gordon would later win at Dover,[tpl]cite news|last=McKee|first=Sandra|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-06-04/sports/0106040155_1_jeff-gordon-dover-dale-Earnhardt|title=Gordon dominates at Dover|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=June 4, 2001|accessdate=July 28, 2013[/tpl] Michigan (the 100th win for Hendrick Motorsports),[tpl]cite web|last=Callahan|first=Terry|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2001/06/10/022903.html|title=Jeff Gordon Interview: Winning at Michigan|work=The Auto Channel|date=June 11, 2001|accessdate=July 28, 2013[/tpl] Indianapolis (Gordon started the race 27th, the lowest starting position for a winning driver at Indianapolis),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/article/2013/07/23/Looking-back-at-Jeff-Gordons-2001-Brickyard-400-win|title=Looking back at Jeff Gordon's 2001 Brickyard 400 win|work=Hendrick Motorsports|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=August 9, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/featured-shows/2013/7/11/sprint-cup-series-brickyard-at-20-2001-jeff-gordon.html|title=Brickyard at 20: 2001|work=NASCAR|date=July 11, 2013|accessdate=July 28, 2013[/tpl] Watkins Glen,[tpl]cite web|last=Spoor|first=Mark|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/nascar_plus/news/2001/08/12/watkins_glen/|title=Gordon takes Global Crossing for seventh road victory|publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated|date=August 12, 2001|accessdate=July 28, 2013[/tpl] and the inaugural race at Kansas.

=====2002–06=====

Gordon entered the 2002 season as defending champion, but the year was far from perfect. A strong showing in the Daytona 500 was ruined when Sterling Marlin sent Gordon spinning in the infield grass with a handful of laps remaining, while leading the race. Gordon had won his 125 qualifier,[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/2002/daytona500/news/2002/02/14/twin_125s_ap/|title=Gordon, Waltrip win Twin 125 qualifying races|work=CNN Sports Illustrated|date=February 14, 2002|accessdate=July 19, 2013[/tpl] but finished ninth in the Daytona 500 after the contact with Marlin. It was announced to the media during the spring event at Darlington that Gordon's then-wife, Brooke, was filing for divorce. Gordon did not win until the Sharpie 500 night race at Bristol in August after passing Rusty Wallace, who was slowed by lapped cars, with three laps left,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/08/26/news_pf/Sports/Gordon_savors_Bristol.shtml|title=Gordon savors Bristol win|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=August 26, 2002|accessdate=July 19, 2013[/tpl] his first victory in the night race at Bristol.

Gordon also was in second to Matt Kenseth for the championship early in the season.
2004 was a huge rebound for the team. Gordon won the Brickyard 400 in August 2004, obtaining his 4th Indy win (1994, 1998, 2001, 2004).[tpl]cite web|first=Terry |last=Blount |url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/8197500/nascar-jeff-gordon-targets-fifth-brickyard-400-win |title=NASCAR – Jeff Gordon targets fifth Brickyard 400 win – ESPN |publisher=ESPN |date=July 26, 2012 |accessdate=August 2, 2012[/tpl] Along with Jimmie Johnson who accomplished the feat in 2012, Gordon shares the title for the NASCAR driver with most Brickyard 400 victories at Indianapolis Motor Speedway with four, and one of only five drivers to have four victories at the historic track.

Had the Chase not existed, and assuming the finishing spots remained the same, Gordon would have won the championship by 47 points.
Gordon started the 2005 season with a win in the Daytona 500, his third win in the event, followed by a win at Martinsville in the Advance Auto Parts 500.

Finishing fourth in the Ford 400, Gordon finished the Chase second in the standings to Hendrick Motorsports teammate Jimmie Johnson, trailing by 77.  However, Gordon's top-ten finish at Homestead left him with a total of 30 top-ten finishes for the season, setting a new modern era Cup Series record. This was the second time that Gordon lost a championship because of the Chase points system. Had the Chase not existed, Gordon would have won the championship by 353 points.[tpl]cite web|last=Smith|first=Marty|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/columns/story?id=3581528|title=Jeff Gordon, six-time champion?

The following week at the Auto Club 500, despite leading 64 laps, Gordon finished runner-up to Matt Kenseth, marking Gordon's 9th top five finish at California. At the Shelby 427 in Las Vegas, Gordon led 17 laps but cut a tire coming into the pits and as a result he finished 6th, despite having a shredded fender. Gordon took his first points lead since 2007. A week later at Atlanta, Gordon collected his second top five of the year in the Kobalt Tools 500 after leading 36 laps. Gordon extended his points lead to 77 points at Bristol in the Food City 500 after finishing fourth.

He extended his point lead to 31 points over Tony Stewart.  Gordon scored second-place finishes behind teammate Mark Martin, in both the June LifeLock 400 at Michigan and the July LifeLock.com 400 at Chicagoland.

Gordon was leading on the final restart of the Crown Royal Presents the Heath Calhoun 400, but was passed by the winner of the race, Kyle Busch. This was Gordon's eighth second-place finish since his last win came at Texas a year ago. At the Southern 500 at Darlington, Gordon led a race-high 110 laps, but was shuffled back to the end of the lead lap as a result of pitting early under caution.

His Chase started off with a disappointing 24th finish at Chicagoland, making a deep hole to climb out of early in the Chase. At New Hampshire Motor Speedway, looked to be a rebound race for Gordon, as he ran well in the spring race. A 4th-place finish boosted him to 5th in points. At Dover International Speedway, the third race in the Chase, a solid 12th-place finish relegated him to ninth in points. At Kansas, Charlotte, and Talladega, Gordon had poor finishes of 34th, 21st, and 27th. At both Martinsville and Texas, he finished inside the top 10. But at Phoenix, he finished 32nd, 112 points behind the leader.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/cup/2011/35/data/standings_official.html |title=NASCAR Sprint Cup Standings |publisher=NASCAR |accessdate=September 21, 2012 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20111116184113/http://www.nascar.com/races/cup/2011/35/data/standings_official.html |archivedate=November 16, 2011[/tpl]
To close out the 2011 season, Gordon was hoping to scratch Homestead-Miami Speedway off his list of tracks he has failed to win at in the Cup Series at the Ford 400, but Tony Stewart and Carl Edwards were the class of the field as both were fighting for the win and the championship. Gordon wound up leading a few laps and coming home with a 5th-place finish. He closed out 2011 8th in the points with his first multi-win season since 2007.

=====2012=====

Gordon's 2012 season started on a frightening note in the Bud Shootout. With two laps to go, Gordon got into a very loose No. 18 car of Kyle Busch and spun him around, collecting other cars. Gordon moved up the race track to avoid the spinning 18, but came across the nose of the No. 51 of Kurt Busch, Kyle's older brother. This was the first time that he ever flipped a stock car.[tpl]cite web|url=http://atlanta.sbnation.com/nascar/2012/2/18/2809207/jeff-gordon-flips-in-horrific-bud-shootout-crash|title=Jeff Gordon Flips in Horrific Bud Shootout Crash| date = February 18, 2012|accessdate =June 21, 2012 |work=SB Nation[/tpl]

At Pocono, Gordon took advantage of teammate Jimmie Johnson's right-rear tire failure on a late restart just immediately before an expected large thunderstorm rained onto the track thus giving him his 86th NASCAR Sprint Cup victory and his 6th at Pocono (interestingly, Gordon's victory at Pocono in 2007 was also rained out), breaking the record for most wins at the track, which was previously shared with Bill Elliott.[tpl]cite news|last=Gelston |first=Dan |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/5/jeff-gordon-gets-win-in-rain-shortened-pocono/print/ |title=Jeff Gordon gets win in rain-shortened Pocono |newspaper=The Washington Times |accessdate=August 6, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/article/2012/08/05/Jeff-Gordon-wins-at-Pocono |title=Jeff Gordon wins at Pocono |work=Hendrick Motorsports |accessdate=August 6, 2012[/tpl] This was the first time since 2007 that Gordon had consecutive seasons with at least one win. At Atlanta, pit strategy put the 24 team in the hunt for a victory, but Gordon couldn't muster past the 11 of Denny Hamlin and wound up in second. At the end of the race, Gordon said that he wished he had "moved him out of the way" to win.[tpl]cite web|last=Pockrass|first=Bob|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2012-09-03/jeff-gordon-getting-soft-denny-hamlin-win-atlanta-motor-speedway|title=Jeff Gordon says he’s getting soft, should have moved Denny Hamlin for win|publisher=Sporting News|date=September 3, 2012|accessdate=July 19, 2013[/tpl]

At the November Phoenix race, Gordon was running near the front until Bowyer again made contact and forced him into the wall. Gordon then cut a tire when trying to retaliate and was penalized with a black-flag for both his attempt at retaliation and failing to come down pit road to fix his tire. In reply to the black-flag Gordon retaliated by intentionally wrecking Bowyer, collecting Joey Logano and Aric Almirola in the process thus ending Bowyer's hopes to win the Cup title. The two crews began brawling while a furious Bowyer climbed out of his car. Bowyer frantically sprinted to Gordon's hauler, but he was restrained by officials just in front of Gordon.[tpl]cite web|last=Hembree|first=Mike|url=http://nascar.speedtv.com/article/cup-clint-bowyer-chases-jeff-gordon-phowenix-sprint-nascar/|title=CUP: Gordon, Bowyer Clash Sparks Fight|publisher=Speed|date=November 11, 2012|accessdate=July 19, 2013[/tpl] Both drivers along with crew chiefs Alan Gustafson and Brian Pattie were summoned to the Oval Office.

He recovered from his penalty by winning the season finale Ford EcoBoost 400 the next week for his 87th Sprint Cup victory of his career. Ironically, Bowyer finished in second-place behind Gordon. It was Gordon's (and Hendrick Motorsports') first win at Homestead-Miami Speedway, and heading into the 2013 season, leaves Kentucky Speedway as the only Sprint Cup track where Gordon has not won at least one race.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/article/2012/11/18/Gordon-wins-at-Homestead-a-Hendrick-Motorsports-first|title=Gordon wins at Homestead – a Hendrick Motorsports' first|work=Hendrick Motorsports|date=November 18, 2012|accessdate=December 25, 2012[/tpl] In victory lane Gordon gave his public apology for his behavior at Phoenix but maintained that NASCAR should have tried to handle he and Bowyer's year-long feud before the Phoenix race.[tpl]cite web|last=Pfeifer|first=Jay|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2012-11-18/nascar-homestead-jeff-gordon-wins-clint-bowyer-brad-keselowski|title=NASCAR Homestead: Jeff Gordon stretches fuel to beat Clint Bowyer for win|publisher=Sporting News|date=November 18, 2012|accessdate=December 8, 2012[/tpl]

===Sponsorship and paint===

Gordon and his team have carried the nickname "The Rainbow Warriors" throughout the years. He has always carried DuPont[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gordonline.com/sponsors.html|title = Jeff Gordon sponsors[/tpl] as a sponsor. From 1993 to 2000, Gordon carried a rainbow scheme that got the team their nickname.  Throughout the years, Gordon has sometimes carried different paint, such as Jurassic Park in 1997, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and NASCAR Racers in 1999, Snoopy in the 2000 Brickyard 400, and a Superman theme in 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/gallery/Jeff-Gordon-Hendrick-Motorsports-No-24-Chevrolet-career-paint-schemes#photo-title=Through+the+years&photo=31573189|title=Inside look: Jeff Gordon's No. 24 through the years|work=Foxsports.com|date=March 6, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2014[/tpl] In 1997, Gordon signed a long-term contract with Pepsi that is still in place today.  Every year Gordon has driven a car with the Pepsi scheme (he almost always has a car with a Pepsi paint scheme at a night race, particularly Daytona in July).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2004/news/headlines/official/06/01/jgordon_pepsi/|title=Gordon to run 'Play for a Billion' paint scheme|work=NASCAR|date=June 1, 2004|accessdate=January 6, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050311140424/http://www.nascar.com/2004/news/headlines/official/06/01/jgordon_pepsi/|archivedate=March 11, 2005[/tpl] In 2001, Gordon debuted a new scheme designed by NASCAR artist Sam Bass, which kept a blue base but changed the rainbow pattern to flames. In 2002, Gordon raced with a special scheme in honor of DuPont's 200th Anniversary. In 2006, Gordon acquired a new sponsor, Nicorette. For the 2004 Nextel All-Star Challenge, Gordon brought back the "Rainbow Warrior" scheme.[tpl]cite news|last=Jenkins|first=Chris|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2004-04-05-gordon-rainbow_x.htm|title=Gordon's car to don rainbow colors for all-star race|newspaper=USA Today|date=April 6, 2004|accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] In 2007, Gordon increased his partnership with Nicorette, and ran the paint scheme in 4 races. At the Charlotte race in 2007, Gordon ran a scheme honoring the United States Department of Defense. Later that year, at Talladega's fall race, Gordon had a fan design contest,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.talladegasuperspeedway.com/Articles/2007/10/Jeff-Gordon-To-Drive-Fans-Design-At-Talladega.aspx?print=true|title=Jeff Gordon to Drive Fan's Design at Talladega|work=Talladega Superspeedway|date=October 1, 2007|accessdate=September 23, 2013[/tpl] and Gordon ultimately won the race. Since 2007, Gordon has had the same design with different colors. (e.g. Nicorette scheme, green and yellow flames). Gordon occasionally ran a paint scheme that supported a different type of DuPont paint such as Cromax Pro.
Gordon announced that the primary scheme of the DuPont No. 24 Chevrolet was to change for 2009 and beyond on the QVC show For Race Fans Only. The 2009 scheme kept the flames format but the colors were radically changed to red and orange flames on a black base color. The new 2009 DuPont paint scheme was unveiled on NBC's Today show. In 2009, the National Guard signed a contract with Gordon, replacing Nicorette. The National Guard was the primary sponsor on Gordon's car for 6–8 races per season through 2010. Occasionally, a one-race sponsor steps in to sponsor Gordon's car for one race. For example, Gordon ran a Megatron scheme at Charlotte in the summer of 2009 to promote the movie Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen that was soon to come out on June 24, 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jeffgordon.com/news/news.php?uid=3403 |title=news.news |work=Jeff Gordon |date=October 20, 2009 |accessdate=August 6, 2012[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Gordon's parents are Carol Ann Bickford (née Houston) and William Grinnell Gordon of Vacaville, California. His stepfather, John Bickford, married in the 1970s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gordonline.com/editorials/050204.html|title=The Bickford Effect|work=Gordon Online|accessdate=September 28, 2013[/tpl] He has an older sister named Kim.

Gordon met first wife Brooke Sealey after he won a Busch Series race. Sealey was then a college student and had been present as Ms. Winston in the victory lane in 1992. The pair began dating in secret, due to a rule that did not allow drivers to date Ms. Winston, and they were married in 1994. In March 2002, Sealey sued for divorce after alleging Gordon of marital misconduct, and Gordon eventually counter-sued.[tpl]Cite episode |title=Jeff Gordon |episodelink= |url= |accessdate=May 28, 2013 |series=SportsCentury |serieslink= |credits= |network=ESPN Classic |language=English |season=4 |seriesno.=19 |date=February 9, 2004[/tpl] In 2003, Gordon's divorce from Sealey became tabloid fodder.
