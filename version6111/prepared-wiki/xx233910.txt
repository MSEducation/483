Three of the mall's anchors changed names in the 1990s. In 1993, Robinson's and May Company merged to form Robinsons-May. As a result, the May store was rebranded Robinsons-May, and the J.W. Robinson's was closed and converted to  J.C. Penney, which had moved from Huntington Center (now Bella Terra).[tpl]cite web |title=Penney to move store to Westminster |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LB&p_theme=lb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAE8EB609D39B47&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |work=Long Beach Press-Telegram |date=1993-02-10 |accessdate=2009-10-04[/tpl] Buffum's also closed that year, becoming a Robinsons-May home store.[tpl]cite web |last=Woodyard |first=Chris |title=Home Store to Open at Buffums Site |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60129993.html?dids=60129993:60129993&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+03%2C+1993&author=CHRIS+WOODYARD&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=Home+Store+to+Open+at+Buffums+Site&pqatl=google |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1993-01-03 |accessdate=2009-10-04[/tpl] In 2002, the Robinsons-May Home Store was torn down for a new Macy's which opened that year.[tpl]cite web |last=Montgomery |first=Tiffany |title=Macy's Renovates Stores in Orange County, Calif. |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-120498844.html |work=Orange County Register |date=2002-04-06 |accessdate=2009-10-04[/tpl] When Federated Department Stores (now Macy's, Inc.) purchased Robinsons-May and other May Co. names in September 2006, Macy's moved to the Robinsons-May building, and the former location soon became a Target. Old Navy was added as well. In 2008, the mall underwent a renovation, relocating the carousel and constructing a play area in its place. The Grand Re-opening was on November 15, 2008.
