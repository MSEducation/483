The college has 145 faculty members, most of whom are involved in interdisciplinary research and academic programs. Twenty-seven faculty members are in the National Academy of Engineering and nine are elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.engr.ucsb.edu/faculty/ |title=Faculty |accessdate=2008-07-31 |publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara[/tpl] Two faculty member have won the Nobel Prize. Alan J. Heeger, Professor of Physics and of Materials, won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry "for the discovery and development of conductive polymers" and Herbert Kroemer, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and of Materials, won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics "for developing semiconductor heterostructures used in high-speed and opto-electronics".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ucsb.edu/nobel/index.shtml |title=UCSB Nobel Laureates |accessdate=2008-07-31  |publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara[/tpl] In 2006 Shuji Nakamura, a professor at Materials Department, won the Millennium Technology Prize for developing blue, green, and white LEDs and the blue laser diode.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.engr.ucsb.edu/faculty/profile/82 |title=Shuji Nakamura |accessdate=2008-07-31  |publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Top prize for 'light' inventor |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5328446.stm |work= |publisher=BBC News |date=September 8, 2006 |accessdate=2008-07-31 [/tpl]

==Publications==

Convergence is the magazine of Engineering and the Sciences at UC Santa Barbara. Sponsored by the College of Engineering, the Division of Mathematical, Life, and Physical Sciences in the College of Letters and Science, and the California NanoSystems Institute, Convergence was begun in early 2005 as a three-times-a-year print publication, with the goal of bringing stories of interest from engineering and the sciences to the desks and coffee tables of a wide range of alumni, friends, partners, funding agencies, corporations, donors and potential supporters. This publication is available online and in print.[tpl]cite web |url=http://convergence.ucsb.edu/about |title=About Convergence Online |accessdate=2008-10-20 |publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara[/tpl]
