[[Renal failure]]

CATEGORIES: Nephrology, Organ failure

Renal failure (also kidney failure or renal insufficiency) is a medical condition in which the kidneys fail to adequately filter waste products from the blood.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/kidneyfailure.html |title=Kidney Failure |author=Medline Plus |year=2012 |work= |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=1 January 2013[/tpl] The two main forms are acute kidney injury, which is often reversible with adequate treatment, and chronic kidney disease, which is often not reversible. In both cases, there is usually an underlying cause.
Renal failure is mainly determined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, the rate at which blood is filtered in the glomeruli of the kidney. This is detected by a decrease in or absence of urine production or determination of waste products (creatinine or urea) in the blood. Depending on the cause, hematuria (blood loss in the urine) and proteinuria (protein loss in the urine) may be noted.
In renal failure, there may be problems with increased fluid in the body (leading to swelling), increased acid levels, raised levels of potassium, decreased levels of calcium, increased levels of phosphate, and in later stages anemia. Bone health may also be affected. Long-term kidney problems are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1155/2012/691369 |title=Insulin Resistance in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease |year=2012 |last1=Liao |first1=Min-Tser |last2=Sung |first2=Chih-Chien |last3=Hung |first3=Kuo-Chin |last4=Wu |first4=Chia-Chao |last5=Lo |first5=Lan |last6=Lu |first6=Kuo-Cheng |journal=Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology |volume=2012 |pages=1–5 |pmid=22919275[/tpl]

==Classification==

Can be divided into two categories: acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. The type of renal failure is determined by the trend in the serum creatinine. Other factors that may help differentiate acute kidney injury from chronic kidney disease include anemia and the kidney size on sonography. Chronic kidney disease generally leads to anemia and small kidney size.

===Acute kidney injury===

Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously called acute renal failure (ARF),[tpl]cite journal |pmid=23194202 |year=2012 |last1=Moore |first1=EM |last2=Bellomo |first2=R |last3=Nichol |first3=AD |title=The meaning of acute kidney injury and its relevance to intensive care and anaesthesia |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=929–48 |journal=Anaesthesia and intensive care[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.4414/smw.2012.13662 |title=New insights in acute kidney failure in the critically ill |year=2012 |last1=Ricci |first1=Zaccaria |last2=Ronco |first2=Claudio |journal=Swiss Medical Weekly |pmid=22923149 |volume=142 |pages=w13662[/tpl] is a rapidly progressive loss of renal function,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001530/ |title=Acute kidney failure |author=A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia |year=2012 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=1 January 2013[/tpl] generally characterized by oliguria (decreased urine production, quantified as less than 400 mL per day in adults,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199803053381007 |title=Acute Oliguria |year=1998 |last1=Klahr |first1=Saulo |last2=Miller |first2=Steven B. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=338 |issue=10 |pages=671–5 |pmid=9486997[/tpl] less than 0.5 mL/kg/h in children or less than 1 mL/kg/h in infants); and fluid and electrolyte imbalance. AKI can result from a variety of causes, generally classified as prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal. The underlying cause must be identified and treated to arrest the progress, and dialysis may be necessary to bridge the time gap required for treating these fundamental causes.

===Chronic kidney disease===

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can also develop slowly and, initially, show few symptoms.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000471.htm |title=Chronic kidney disease |author=Medline Plus |year=2011 |work=A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=1 January 2013[/tpl] CKD can be the long term consequence of irreversible acute disease or part of a disease progression.

===Acute-on-chronic renal failure===

Acute kidney injuries can be present on top of chronic kidney disease, a condition called acute-on-chronic renal failure (AoCRF). The acute part of AoCRF may be reversible, and the goal of treatment, as with AKI, is to return the patient to baseline renal function, typically measured by serum creatinine. Like AKI, AoCRF can be difficult to distinguish from chronic kidney disease if the patient has not been monitored by a physician and no baseline (i.e., past) blood work is available for comparison.

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms can vary from person to person. Someone in early stage kidney disease may not feel sick or notice symptoms as they occur. When kidneys fail to filter properly, waste accumulates in the blood and the body, a condition called azotemia. Very low levels of azotaemia may produce few, if any, symptoms. If the disease progresses, symptoms become noticeable (if the failure is of sufficient degree to cause symptoms). Renal failure accompanied by noticeable symptoms is termed uraemia.[tpl]cite web  | last = Dr Per Grinsted  | title = Kidney failure (renal failure with uremia, or azotaemia)  | date = 2005-03-02  | url = http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/kidneyfailure.htm  | accessdate = 2009-05-26[/tpl]

==Causes==

===Acute kidney injury===

Acute kidney injury (previously known as acute renal failure) - or AKI - usually occurs when the blood supply to the kidneys is suddenly interrupted or when the kidneys become overloaded with toxins. Causes of acute kidney injury include accidents, injuries, or complications from surgeries in which the kidneys are deprived of normal blood flow for extended periods of time. Heart-bypass surgery is an example of one such procedure.
Drug overdoses, accidental or from chemical overloads of drugs such as antibiotics or chemotherapy, may also cause the onset of acute kidney injury. Unlike chronic kidney disease, however, the kidneys can often recover from acute kidney injury, allowing the patient to resume a normal life. People suffering from acute kidney injury require supportive treatment until their kidneys recover function, and they often remain at increased risk of developing future kidney failure.[ref]

Among the accidental causes of renal failure is the crush syndrome, when large amounts of toxins are suddenly released in the blood circulation after a long compressed limb is suddenly relieved from the pressure obstructing the blood flow through its tissues, causing ischemia. The resulting overload can lead to the clogging and the destruction of the kidneys. It is a reperfusion injury that appears after the release of the crushing pressure. The mechanism is believed to be the release into the bloodstream of muscle breakdown products – notably myoglobin, potassium, and phosphorus – that are the products of rhabdomyolysis (the breakdown of skeletal muscle damaged by ischemic conditions). The specific action on the kidneys is not fully understood, but may be due in part to nephrotoxic metabolites of myoglobin.

===Chronic kidney disease===

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has numerous causes. The most common causes of CKD are diabetes mellitus and long-term, uncontrolled hypertension.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=23120821 |year=2011 |last1=Kes |first1=Petar |last2=Basić-Jukić |first2=Nikolina |last3=Ljutić |first3=Dragan |last4=Brunetta-Gavranić |first4=Bruna |title=Uloga arterijske hipertenzije u nastanku kroničnog zatajenja bubrega |trans_title=The role of arterial hypertension in the development of chronic renal failure |language=Croatian |volume=65 |issue=Suppl 3 |pages=78–84 |journal=Acta Medica Croatica |url=http://www.amzh.hr/amc/pdf/amc_2011%20vol%2065%20supplement%203.pdf[/tpl] Polycystic kidney disease is another well-known cause of CKD. The majority of people afflicted with polycystic kidney disease have a family history of the disease. Other genetic illnesses affect kidney function, as well.
Overuse of common drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen (paracetamol) can also cause chronic kidney damage.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199412223312502 |title=Risk of Kidney Failure Associated with the Use of Acetaminophen, Aspirin, and Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs |year=1994 |last1=Perneger |first1=Thomas V. |last2=Whelton |first2=Paul K. |last3=Klag |first3=Michael J. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=331 |issue=25 |pages=1675–9 |pmid=7969358[/tpl]
Some infectious diseases, such as hantavirus, can attack the kidneys, causing kidney failure.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-with-hantavirus-infection-hemorrhagic-fever-with-renal-syndrome |title=Renal involvement with hantavirus infection (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome) |first1=Gerald B |last1=Appel |first2=Jukka |last2=Mustonen |year=2012 |work= |publisher=UpToDate |accessdate=1 January 2013[/tpl]

===Genetic predisposition===

The APOL1 gene has been proposed as a major genetic risk locus for a spectrum of nondiabetic renal failure in individuals of African origin, these include HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), primary nonmonogenic forms of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and hypertension affiliated chronic kidney disease not attributed to other etiologies.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.2215/CJN.08721209 |title=The Spectrum of MYH9-Associated Nephropathy |year=2010 |last1=Bostrom |first1=M.

==Diagnostic approach==

===Measurement for CKD===

Chronic kidney failure is measured in five stages, which are calculated using a patient’s GFR, or glomerular filtration rate. Stage 1 CKD is mildly diminished renal function, with few overt symptoms. Stages 2 and 3 need increasing levels of supportive care from their medical providers to slow and treat their renal dysfunction. Patients in stages 4 and 5 usually require preparation of the patient towards active treatment in order to survive. Stage 5 CKD is considered a severe illness and requires some form of renal replacement therapy (dialysis) or kidney transplant whenever feasible.
A normal GFR varies according to many factors, including sex, age, body size and ethnic background. Renal professionals consider the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to be the best overall index of kidney function.Fadem, Stephen Z., M.D., FACP, FASN. Calculators for HealthCare Professionals. National Kidney Foundation. 13 Oct 2008 The National Kidney Foundation offers an easy to use on-line GFR calculator[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kidney.org/professionals/KDOQI/gfr_calculator.cfm |title=GFR calculator |publisher=Kidney.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl] for anyone who is interested in knowing their glomerular filtration rate. (A serum creatinine level, a simple blood test, is needed to use the calculator).

===Use of the term uremia===

Before the advancement of modern medicine, renal failure was often referred to as uremic poisoning. Uremia was the term for the contamination of the blood with urine.It is the presence of excessive amount of urea in blood. Starting around 1847, this included reduced urine output, which was thought to be caused by the urine mixing with the blood instead of being voided through the urethra.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl] The term uremia is now used for the illness accompanying kidney failure.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMra071313 |title=Uremia |year=2007 |last1=Meyer |first1=Timothy W. |last2=Hostetter |first2=Thomas H. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=357 |issue=13 |pages=1316–25 |pmid=17898101[/tpl]
