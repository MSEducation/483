The band have self-described their sound a mix between Rock and Metal. Although sources have described their sound as everything from Hardcore Punk to Metalcore, Emo and nu metal.

==History==

Torch was formed in Trondheim, Norway in 1999. Their style back then was a combination of hardcore and nu metal. The sound of their early demos bears a strong resemblance to the style of bands like Korn, Deftones and especially Snot.
In 2003, with new key members added to the line-up, they released the Visions of... EP. It was released independently through Hardstar Records. The EP led to a successful national tour with the bands Miksha and Turdus Musicus in early 2004. They toured England the same year, gaining praise from small, but enthusiastic crowds.
In 2005, the band would sign to the Norwegian indie label Kong Tiki Records. Their video, The Experiment debuted on the national TV charts Urørt Svisj and ZTV. It helped them keep the fire hot while they started recording their debut album. The recording process would eventually take 7 months to complete. The documentary, titled How To Start a Fire was added as a limited edition bonus DVD on their debut album. The Experiment remains the band's most well-known song.
On March 27, 2006 Death To Perfection was released. It debuted at No. 23 on the Norwegian Billboard Chart, supported by a video for the song K-Bomb that would air weekly on ZTV. The album debuted at No. 1 on the charts on Trøndertoppen (The Trønder Top). The band would end up playing the biggest festivals in the country like Quart Festivalen and Stavern Festivalen, sharing stages with bands like Tool, Placebo, Opeth and Wolfmother.
In 2008, the band released a self-titled EP on cassette to the surprise of some. Torch are in the midst of recording their second album, which was planned for a late 2009/early 2010 release. Although the recording session didn't end until the end of 2010 when they sent the album into the final mixing and mastering. The album Pt.IV: A New Beginning was recorded and engineered by Jørgen (guitar) and the band in their own studio. Except the drums, which was recorded at Skarp Studio with Jon-Tore Dombu (ex-guitarist in Torch, the Hate Colony). It was mixed by Steve Evetts in late 2010, and mastered by Alan Douches at West West Side Music.
The album Pt.IV: A New Beginning was released in Europe on August 26, 2011.Official website
In November 2011 some of the members from Torch (Ola, Jørgen) produced the EP "Man is a Wolf to Man" for the sludge/prog metal band Terodon
