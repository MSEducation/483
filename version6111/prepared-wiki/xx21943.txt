In physics and chemistry, the Faraday constant (named after Michael Faraday) is the magnitude of electric charge per mole of electrons.The term "magnitude" is used in the sense of "absolute value": The charge of an electron is negative, but F is always defined to be positive. It has the currently accepted value
The constant F has a simple relation to two other physical constants:
where
NA is the Avogadro constant (the ratio of the number of particles N to the amount of substance n - a unit mole), and e is the elementary charge or the magnitude of the charge of an electron. This relation is true because the amount of charge of a mole of electrons is equal to the amount of charge in one electron multiplied by the number of electrons in a mole.
One common use of the faraday constant is Electrolysis. One can divide the amount of charge in coulombs by the Faraday constant in order to find the amount (in moles) of the element that has been Oxidized.
The value of F was first determined by weighing the amount of silver deposited in an electrochemical reaction in which a measured current was passed for a measured time, and using Faraday's law of electrolysis.NIST Introduction to physical constants Research is continuing into more accurate ways of determining the interrelated constants F, NA, and e.

==Other Common Units of Faraday's Constant==

==Faraday unit of charge==

Related to Faraday's constant is the "faraday", a unit of electrical charge. It is much less common than the coulomb, but sometimes used in electrochemistry.Foundations Of Physics, Volume 2, by R. S. Gambhir, p51 One faraday of charge is the magnitude of the charge of one mole of electrons, i.e. [tpl]physconst|F|unit=no|after=Â C.[/tpl]
Expressed in faradays, the Faraday constant F equals "1 faraday of charge per mole".
This faraday unit is not to be confused with the farad, an unrelated unit of capacitance (1 farad= 1 coulomb/1 volt).

The Simpsons episode "Dark Knight Court" (RABF10) has Mr. Burns asking Comic Book Guy how much he wants for his entire comic book inventory.  He says "the speed of light expressed as dollars" and Mr. Burns says to Smithers, "give him Faraday's Constant."  The check is written for $96,485.34.
