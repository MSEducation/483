[[Bookmark (World Wide Web)]]

CATEGORIES: Web browsers, Internet terminology

In the context of the World Wide Web, a bookmark is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is stored for later retrieval in any of various storage formats. All modern web browsers include bookmark features. Bookmarks are called favorites or Internet shortcuts in Internet Explorer, and by virtue of that browser's large market share, these terms have been synonymous with bookmark since the first browser war. Bookmarks are normally accessed through a menu in the user's web browser, and folders are commonly used for organization. In addition to bookmarking methods within most browsers, many external applications offer bookmark management.
Bookmarks have been incorporated in browsers since the Mosaic browser in 1993."New X-based information systems browser available.", post to comp.infosystems by Marc Andreeseen on February 16, 1993 Bookmark lists were called Hotlists in Mosaic"May World-Wide Web News" in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee and in previous versions of Opera; this term has faded from common use. Other early web browsers such as ViolaWWW and Cello also had bookmarking features.
With the advent of social bookmarking, shared bookmarks have become a means for users sharing similar interests to pool web resources, or to store their bookmarks in such a way that they are not tied to one specific computer or browser.  Web-based bookmarking services let users save bookmarks on a remote web server, accessible from anywhere.
Newer browsers have expanded the "bookmark" feature to include variations on the concept of saving links. Mozilla Firefox introduced live bookmarks in 2004,"Mozilla Foundation Releases the Highly Anticipated Mozilla Firefox 1.0 Web Browser", press release on November 9, 2004 which resemble standard bookmarks but contain a list of links to recent articles supplied by a news site or weblog, which is regularly updated via RSS feeds. "Bookmarklets" are JavaScript programs stored as bookmarks that can be clicked to perform a function.

==Storage==

Each browser has a built-in tool for managing the list of bookmarks.  The list storage method varies, depending on the browser, its version, and the operating system on which it runs.
Netscape-derived browsers store bookmarks in the single HTML-coded file bookmarks.html.  This approach permits publication and printing of a categorized and indented catalog, and works across platforms.  Bookmark names need not be unique.  Editing this file outside of its native browser requires editing HTML.
Firefox 3 stores bookmarks, history, cookies, and preferences in a transactionally secure database format (SQLite).
Internet Explorer's "Favorites" (also "Internet Shortcuts") are stored as individual files named with the original link name, and the filename extension ".URL",[tpl]cite web|url=http://filext.com/file-extension/URL|title=File Extension .URL Details|publisher=Filext.com|accessdate=2009-08-28|format=Web[/tpl] for example "Home Page.URL" collected in a directory named "Favorites" which may have subdirectories.  Bookmark names must be unique within a folder.  Each file contains the original URL and Microsoft-specific metadata. Browsers have varying abilities to import and export bookmarks to favorites, and vice versa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa753582(VS.85).aspx|title=Netscape Bookmark File Format|accessdate=2009-08-27|publisher=Microsoft|format=Web[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/211089|title=How to import and export the Internet Explorer Favorites folder to a 32-bit version of Windows|publisher= Microsoft|accessdate=2009-08-28|format=Web[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.codeproject.com/KB/shell/iefavdecon.aspx|title=How favorites are stored on Windows XP and Vista|publisher=Codeproject|format=Web|first=Jean-Paul|last=Mikkers|accessdate=2009-08-28[/tpl]

==Bookmarklets==

Bookmarklets are JavaScript programs stored as bookmarks. The term is a portmanteau of the words bookmark and applet. Bookmarklets are possible because the JavaScript URI scheme allows JavaScript programs to be stored as URIs, which can be stored in bookmarks. Bookmarklets have access to the current page, which they may inspect and change. As such, they can be simple "one-click" tools which add functionality to the browser. Bookmarklets are typically installed by navigating to a web page that links to a JavaScript URI, right-clicking the link, and clicking the bookmark option.
Web developer Steve Kangas got the idea from the Netscape JavaScript Guide, and coined the term bookmarklets in 1998. Brendan Eich, the inventor of JavaScript, explained bookmarklets as follows:

==Live bookmarks==

Live bookmarks are internet bookmarks, particularly in Mozilla Firefox that are powered by RSS. It allow users to dynamically monitor changes to their favorite news sources. Instead of treating RSS-feeds as HTML pages like most news aggregators do, they are treated as bookmarks that are updated in real-time with a link to the appropriate source. Live bookmarks are updated automatically; however no browser option exists to prevent or control the automatic Live Bookmark updates.

==Bookmark management==

Since web links may serve as sources of research or reference together with any files on a user's local computer or network (or refer to user's data in various web-based software), methods have emerged for organising user's bookmarks based on the user's view of his/her data structure. Of these methods, folders and tags in browsers' integrated bookmark managers are basic forms. Alternatively, knowledge management, document management and notetaking software may store bookmarks along with any other kinds of data that the software supports.
