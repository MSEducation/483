He scored 16 league goals in 31 appearances for the Sicilian outfit, winning the Lega Pro Seconda Divisione Capocannoniere (top scorer) that season for his Girone. His performances were often eye-catching, thus impressing scouts of several Serie A and Serie B teams.http://www.tuttocalciatori.net/Di_Cosmo_Julian He eventually completed a transfer to Calcio Catania of the Serie A.http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/catania/?action=read&idnet=aXRhc3BvcnRwcmVzcy5pdC04Mg

With Melgar, Di Cosmo earned a starting shirt once again, making 41 league appearances and scoring 11 goals in the process. On 31 December 2012, after just one year in the Peruvian Primera División, Di Cosmo returned to Bolivia with Oriente Petrolero on a free transfer. He has since scored 3 goals in 19 league appearances for his club.http://int.soccerway.com/national/peru/primera-division/2013/1st-phase/r20188/
