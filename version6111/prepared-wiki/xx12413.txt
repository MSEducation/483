</ref> The resulting [[spin polarization]] of xenon [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] can surpass 50% of its maximum possible value, greatly exceeding the thermal equilibrium value dictated by [[paramagnetic]] statistics (typically 0.001% of the maximum value at [[room temperature]], even in the strongest [[magnet]]s). Such non-equilibrium alignment of spins is a temporary condition, and is called ''[[hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarization]]''. The process of hyperpolarizing the xenon is called ''optical pumping'' (although the process is different from [[optical pumping|pumping a laser]]).<ref>

Because a 129Xe nucleus has a spin of 1/2, and therefore a zero electric quadrupole moment, the 129Xe nucleus does not experience any quadrupolar interactions during collisions with other atoms, and thus its hyperpolarization can be maintained for long periods of time even after the laser beam has been turned off and the alkali vapor removed by condensation on a room-temperature surface. Spin polarization of 129Xe can persist from several seconds for xenon atoms dissolved in blood[ref]
