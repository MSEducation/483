[[Alush]]

CATEGORIES: Torah places

Alush ([tpl]lang-he|אָלוּשׁ[/tpl]) was one of the places, the last before Rephidim, at which the Israelites rested on their way to Mount Sinai (Numbers 33:13, 14). It was probably situated on the shore of the Red Sea. It means a crowd of men. A particular event that occurred here was the story in the Exodus where water flowed from a rock.
