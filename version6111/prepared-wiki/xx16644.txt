</ref> Most abnormal results are mildly abnormal (ASC-US (typically 2–5% of Pap results) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ([[Bethesda System#LSIL|LSIL]])  (about 2% of results)), indicating HPV infection.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] Although most low-grade cervical dysplasias spontaneously regress without ever leading to [[cervical cancer]], dysplasia can serve as an indication that increased vigilance is needed.
In a typical scenario, about 0.5% of Pap results are high-grade SIL (HSIL), and less than 0.5% of results indicate cancer; 0.2 to 0.8% of results indicate Atypical Glandular Cells of Undetermined Significance (AGC-NOS).[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl]
As liquid based preparations (LBPs) become a common medium for testing, atypical result rates have increased. The median rate for all preparations with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions using LBPs was 2.9% compared with a 2003 median rate of 2.1%. Rates for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (median, 0.5%) and atypical squamous cells have changed little.[tpl]cite journal | author = Eversole GM, Moriarty AT, Schwartz MR, Clayton AC, Souers R, Fatheree LA, Chmara BA, Tench WD, Henry MR, Wilbur DC | title = Practices of participants in the college of american pathologists interlaboratory comparison program in cervicovaginal cytology, 2006 | journal = Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine | volume = 134 | issue = 3 | pages = 331–5 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20196659 | doi = 10.1043/1543-2165-134.3.331 | doi_brokendate = 2014-03-24 | display-authors = 8 [/tpl]
Abnormal results are reported according to the Bethesda system.Nayar R, Solomon D. Second edition of 'The Bethesda System for reporting cervical cytology' – Atlas, website, and Bethesda interobserver reproducibility project. CytoJournal online 2004 2011 Apr 16;1:4. Available from: http://www.cytojournal.com/text.asp?2004/1/1/4/41272 They include:
Endocervical and endometrial abnormalities can also be detected, as can a number of infectious processes, including yeast, herpes simplex virus and trichomoniasis.  However it is not very sensitive at detecting these infections, so absence of detection on a Pap does not mean absence of the infection.

==Effectiveness==

The Pap test, when combined with a regular program of screening and appropriate follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer deaths by up to 80%.[tpl]cite journal | author = Arbyn M, Anttila A, Jordan J, Ronco G, Schenck U, Segnan N, Wiener H, Herbert A, von Karsa L | title = European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Cervical Cancer Screening.

Failure of prevention of cancer by the Pap test can occur for many reasons, including not getting regular screening, lack of appropriate follow up of abnormal results, and sampling and interpretation errors.[tpl]cite book| author = DeMay, M. | year = 2007 | title = Practical principles of cytopathology.  Revised edition. | isbn = 978-0-89189-549-7| publisher = American Society for Clinical Pathology Press| location = Chicago, IL[/tpl]  In the US, over half of all invasive cancers occur in women that have never had a Pap smear; an additional 10 to 20% of cancers occur in women that have not had a Pap smear in the preceding five years.  About one-quarter of US cervical cancers were in women that had an abnormal Pap smear, but did not get appropriate follow-up (woman did not return for care, or clinician did not perform recommended tests or treatment).
Adenocarcinoma of the cervix has not been shown to be prevented by Pap tests.  In the UK, which has a Pap smear screening program, Adenocarcinoma accounts for about 15% of all cervical cancers[tpl]cite web| title=Cancer Research UK website | url = http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/cervix/incidence/ | accessdate = 2009-01-03[/tpl]
Estimates of the effectiveness of the United Kingdom's call and recall system vary widely, but it may prevent about 700 deaths per year in the UK. A medical practitioner performing 200 tests each year would prevent a death once in 38 years, while seeing 152 women with abnormal results, referring 79 for investigation, obtaining 53 abnormal biopsy results, and seeing 17 persisting abnormalities lasting longer than two years. At least one woman during the 38 years would die from cervical cancer despite being screened.[tpl]cite journal | author = Raffle AE, Alden B, Quinn M, Babb PJ, Brett MT | title = Outcomes of screening to prevent cancer: analysis of cumulative incidence of cervical abnormality and modelling of cases and deaths prevented | journal = BMJ | volume = 326 | issue = 7395 | page = 901 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12714468 | pmc = 153831 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.326.7395.901 [/tpl]
Since the population of the UK is about 61 million, the maximum number of women who could be receiving Pap smears in the UK is around 15 million to 20 million (eliminating the percentage of the population under 20 and over 65).   This would indicate that the use of Pap smear screening in the UK saves the life of 1 person for every approximately 20,000 people tested (assuming  15,000,000 are being tested yearly).  If only 10,000,000 are actually tested each year, then it would save the life of 1 person for every approximately 15,000 people tested.

==Practical aspects==

The endocervix may be partially sampled with the device used to obtain the ectocervical sample, but, due to the anatomy of this area, consistent and reliable sampling cannot be guaranteed. As abnormal endocervical cells may be sampled, those examining them are taught to recognize them.
The endometrium is not directly sampled with the device used to sample the ectocervix. Cells may exfoliate onto the cervix and be collected from there, so as with endocervical cells, abnormal cells can be recognised if present but the Pap Test should not be used as a screening tool for endometrial malignancy.
In the United States, a pap test itself costs $20 to $30, but the costs for pap test visits can cost over $1,000, largely because additional tests are added that may or may not be necessary.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bettigole C | title = The Thousand-Dollar Pap Smear | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 16 | pages = 1486–1487 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24131176 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1307295 [/tpl]

==In pregnancy==

Pap tests can usually be performed during pregnancy up to at least 24 weeks of gestational age.PapScreen Victoria > Pregnant women from Cancer Council Victoria 2014 Pap tests during pregnancy have not been associated with increased risk of miscarriage.

==History==

The test was invented by and named after the prominent Greek doctor Georgios Papanikolaou. Aurel Babeş of Romania independently made similar discoveries in 1927.M.J. O'Dowd, E.E. Philipp, The History of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, London, Parthenon Publishing Group, 1994, p. 547. However, it should be noted that Babeş method was radically different from Papanicolaou's.Diamantis A, Magiorkinis E, Androutsos G., What's in a name? Evidence that Papanicolaou, not Babes, deserves credit for the Pap test., Diagn Cytopathol. 2010 Jul;38(7):473-6. doi: 10.1002/dc.21226
Papanicolaou's name was repeatedly submitted to the Nobel Committee and rejected every time. The Nobel Committee delegated the in-depth investigation of Papanicolaou's merits and demerits to the late Professor Santesson, who was at that time the head of pathology at the Stockholm Cancer Institute (the Radiumhemmet). The investigator discovered Babeş' contributions that had never been cited by Papanicolaou and duly reported this fact to the Committee, which then rejected Papanicolaou's Nobel award.Koss, Leopold G. M.D., International Journal of Gynecology Pathology, http://journals.lww.com/intjgynpathology/Fulltext/2003/01000/Aurel_Babes.20.aspx#P20

==Experimental techniques==

In the developed world, cervical biopsy guided by colposcopy is considered the "gold standard" for diagnosing cervical abnormalities after an abnormal pap smear. The procedure requires a trained colposcopist and can be expensive to perform. However, Pap smears are very sensitive and some negative biopsy results may represent undersampling of the lesion in the biopsy, so negative biopsy with positive cytology requires careful follow up.Bewtra C, Pathan M, Hashish H. Abnormal Pap smears with negative follow-up biopsies: Improving cytohistologic correlations. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dc.10329/abstract
Experimental visualization techniques use broad-band light (e.g., direct visualization, speculoscopy, cervicography, visual inspection with acetic acid or with Lugol's, and colposcopy) and electronic detection methods (e.g., Polarprobe and in-vivo Spectroscopy). These techniques are less expensive and can be performed with significantly less training. They do not perform as well as Pap smear screening and colposcopy. At this point, these techniques have not been validated by large-scale trials and are not in general use.

==Global studies==

There are results from a study in the southern United States showing conditions under which females did or did not receive pap tests, who they were, and what their overall reasonings were:
 The most common reason reported by women as to why they had not a Pap test was cost (25%), followed by reporting a doctor had not recommended the test (22%). Conclusions: Pap testing was most frequent among African American women. Subsets, such as women with less education, low income, and no health insurance, however, may not be adequately screened for cervical cancer. 
 "Recent Pap test use was somewhat lower among women 65 (86% for ages 65–69, 83% for ages 70–74, 76% for ages 75–79), among white women (82%) and women of other race/ethnicity (85%), among women with less than a high school education (85%), and among women with lower household incomes (86% for $15,000 annually)."  See Tables 3 and 4 provided at:http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=c456f9bb-cab6-4f69-a99e-d44cf337b135%40sessionmgr111&vid=2&hid=127#944[tpl]cite journal |last=NB Peterson; HJ Murff; Y Cui; M Hargreaves; JH Fowke |title=Papanicolaou testing among women in the southern United States |journal=Journal of Women's Health |date=Jul–Aug 2008 |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=939–46 |url=http://westminster.worldcat.org/title/papanicolaou-testing-among-women-in-the-southern-united-states/oclc/264677368 |accessdate=October 15, 2013[/tpl] 
There are results from a nationwide study in Taiwan showing conditions under which female personnel do or do not receive Pap tests. The following results were gathered:
 57.7% of the female medical personnel had received a Pap test in 2008–2010. 
 Pap-test rates were highest for pharmacists (58.1%) and nurses (58.0%) and lowest for physicians (48.6%). 
 Female medical personnel not having received Pap tests were older, had chronic diseases, and so on.[tpl]cite journal |last=Fang-Hsin Leea, Chung-Yi Lic, Hsiu-Hung Wanga, Yung-Mei Yang |title=The utilization of Pap tests among different female medical personnel: A nationwide study in Taiwan |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743513000704 |work=Preventive Medicine|volume=56 |issue=6 |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2013.03.001[/tpl] 
These results further suggest that most middle and upper class women have access to the Pap test and can choose to have one done annually. On the other hand, poor women, like those in the southern US study, may not always have access to the Pap test.

==Coccoid bacteria==

The finding of coccoid bacteria on a pap test is of no consequence with otherwise normal test findings and no infectious symptoms. However, if there is enough inflammation to obscure the detection of pre-cancerous and cancerous processes, it may indicate treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic for streptococci and anaerobic bacteria (such as metronidazole and amoxicillin) before repeating the smear. Alternatively, the test will be repeated at an earlier time than it would otherwise.OB-GYN 101: Introductory Obstetrics & Gynecology > Coccoid Bacteria by Michael Hughey Hughey at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Retrieved Feb 2014. If there are symptoms of vaginal discharge, bad odor or irritation, the presence of coccoid bacteria also may indicate treatment with antibiotics as per above.
