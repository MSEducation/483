.</ref> The graph is equivalent to the [[Circulant matrix|circulant graph]] Ci<sub>6</sub>(1,3). [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] proved in 1930 that K<sub>3,3</sub> is nonplanar, and thus that the problem has no solution.  Kullman, however, states that "Interestingly enough, Kuratowski did not publish a detailed proof that [ K<sub>3,3</sub> is ] non-planar".<ref name="kullman1979"/>
One proof of the impossibility of finding a planar embedding of K3,3 uses a case analysis involving the Jordan curve theorem, in which one examines different possibilities for the locations of the vertices with respect to the 4-cycles of the graph and shows that they are all inconsistent with a planar embedding.[tpl]cite book|last=Trudeau|first=Richard J.|title=Introduction to Graph Theory |year=1993 |publisher=Dover Pub.|location=New York |isbn=978-0-486-67870-2 |pages=68–70|url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486678709.html |edition=Corrected, enlarged republication. |accessdate=8 August 2012[/tpl] Alternatively, it is possible to show that any bridgeless bipartite planar graph with V vertices and E edges has [tpl]nowrap|E ≤ 2V − 4[/tpl] by combining the Euler formula [tpl]nowrap|1=V - E + F = 2[/tpl] (where F is the number of faces of a planar embedding) with the observation that the number of faces is at most half the number of edges (because each face has at least four edges and each edge belongs to exactly two faces). In the utility graph, E = 9 and 2V − 4 = 8, violating this inequality, so the utility graph cannot be planar.
Two important characterizations of planar graphs, Kuratowski's theorem that the planar graphs are exactly the graphs that contain neither K3,3 nor the complete graph K5 as a subdivision, and Wagner's theorem that the planar graphs are exactly the graphs that contain neither K3,3 nor K5 as a minor, encompass this result.

==Generalizations==

K3,3 is toroidal, which means it can be embedded on the torus. In terms of the three cottage problem this means the problem can be solved by punching two holes through the plane (or the sphere) and connecting them with a tube. This changes the topological properties of the surface and using the tube we can connect the three cottages without crossing lines. An equivalent statement is that the graph genus of the utility graph is one, and therefore it cannot be embedded in a surface of genus less than one. A surface of genus one is equivalent to a torus.
Pál Turán's "brick factory problem" asks more generally for a formula for the minimum number of crossings in a drawing of the complete bipartite graph Ka,b in terms of the numbers of vertices a and b on the two sides of the bipartition. The utility graph K3,3 may be drawn with only one crossing, but not with zero crossings, so its crossing number is one. A toroidal embedding of K3,3 may be obtained by replacing the crossing by a tube, as described above, in which the two holes where the tube connects to the plane are placed along one of the crossing edges on either side of the crossing.

==Other graph-theoretic properties==

The utility graph K3,3 is, like all other complete bipartite graphs, a well-covered graph, meaning that every maximal independent set has the same size. In this graph, the only two maximal independent sets are the two sides of the bipartition, and obviously they are equal. K3,3 is one of only seven 3-regular 3-connected well-covered graphs.[ref]

It is also a Laman graph, meaning that it forms a minimally rigid system when it is embedded (with crossings) in the plane. It is the smallest example of a nonplanar Laman graph, as the other minimal nonplanar graph, K5, is not minimally rigid.
