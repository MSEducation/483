King went to school at Hamble Community Sports College before attending Barton Peveril Sixth Form College. Her father, Trevor King, is a former biathlete who competed in two Winter Olympics.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/success-stopped-me-being-seen-as-a-weirdo-says-star-dani-king-8738005.html |title=Success stopped me being seen as a weirdo, says star Dani King |last1=Beard |first1=Matthew |date=30 July 2013 |website=London Evening Standard|accessdate=29 October 2013[/tpl] She has a younger sister. Whilst attending Hamble school the British cycling talent team visited in 2005 where they chose her to be on their training team. In 2009 she came down with glandular fever whilst training to become an elite cyclist, leading to worries about her career being over. She recovered, however, and was later chosen to compete at world champion level in late 2011 and after setting world record with her pursuit co athletes she was chosen for team GB.cite web |biography http://www.daniking.co.uk/profile/
