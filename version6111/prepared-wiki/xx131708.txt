CATEGORIES: Defunct consumer brands, Citrus sodas

Rondo was a citrus-flavored soft drink available in limited U.S. markets in the late 1970s and early 1980s, one which was "blended from fine essences", and "lightly carbonated". It is mostly famous for its slogan - "Rondo---The Thirst Crusher" - as well as its commercials, featuring people crushing the cans in various ways.  The cans featured bright yellow packaging for regular Rondo and green packaging for Diet Rondo.
