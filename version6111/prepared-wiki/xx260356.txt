===Laporte: Joseph Ranger===

Joseph Ranger was a longtime activist for Quebec's social credit movement and a perennial candidate for political office, having run in eight provincial elections and two federal elections. A Globe and Mail report lists him as having been fifty-four years old in 1969.Ronald Lebel, "Creditistes' entry into politics likely to be swamped by UN win," Globe and Mail, 25 September 1969. He identified as a truck driver in 1968 and as a pensioner in 1974.History of Federal Ridings since 1867: SAINT-HENRI (1968/06/25), Parliament of Canada, accessed 31 December 2010; History of Federal Ridings since 1867: WESTMOUNT (1974/07/08), Parliament of Canada, accessed 31 December 2010.
Ranger ran for the Ralliement national in the 1966 provincial election and for Réal Caouette's Ralliement des créditistes in the 1968 federal election. He later joined the Parti crédit social uni, a dissident group that opposed Caouette's leadership, and ran for this party in two provincial elections.Ronald Lebel, "Creditistes' entry into politics likely to be swamped by UN win," Globe and Mail, 25 September 1969. The division between the parties seems to have been resolved, and Ranger was a candidate for Caouette's re-united Social Credit Party of Canada in the 1974 federal election.
The official provincial wing of the Social Credit Party wound down at the end of the 1970s, and the PCSU was revived in 1979 as a replacement. Ranger ran for this party five times in the early to mid-1980s.
A candidate named Joseph Ranger ran for a school trustee position on the south shore of Montreal in late 1985; for the purposes of this article, it is assumed this was the same person. A different Joseph Ranger served as a municipal politician in western Quebec in the same period.
