==Career==

Shahin came through the youth ranks at Grimsby Town, and notably scored the winning goal in the clubs' 1â€“0 Midlands Floodlit Youth Cup final victory over Walsall in 2006. Shahin began to shine in the youth side managed by Neil Woods, and he became ever present in the side. In 2007 Shahin was snubbed a professional contract by Grimsby and was released. He went on to sign for Yorkshire non-League outfit Armthorpe Welfare. 
Following his departure from Welfare, he briefly played at an amateur level for Lincs International FC and A & G Auto Repairs FC. Back at Grimsby, his former youth boss Neil Woods, recommended Shahin to first team manager Mike Newell, who in turn gave him a trial, which he succeeded in impressing enough to earn a professional contract until the end of the 2009-10 season. Shahin made his professional debut on 17 October, in a 2-0 home defeat against Rochdale.
Shahin was released by Grimsby Town on 12 May 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grimsby-townfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10417~2050024,00.html |title=Grimsby Town | News | Latest News | Latest News | 3 Released, 7 Transfer Listed |publisher=Grimsby-townfc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13[/tpl] In August 2010 he signed for Non League side Selby Townhttp://www.yorkpress.co.uk/sport/8317339.New_era_starts_for_Selby_Town/
