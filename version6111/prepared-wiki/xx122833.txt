The Wanette–Byars Bridge is a long bridge in central Oklahoma. It crosses the Canadian River between Byars in McClain Co. and Wanette in Pottawatomie County. The bridge is on a county road, not a state-designated highway.

Until 1992, the bridge had a wooden deck. In 1992, the bridge's deck was destroyed by arson, closing it for two years. When the bridge reopened, it had a concrete and asphalt driving surface.
The bridge is an oft-utilized link between Byars and Wanette. The two nearest bridges are between fifteen and twenty-five miles (24–40 km) away.
