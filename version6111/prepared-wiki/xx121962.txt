It is located on Madison Avenue, attached to the south side of the Empire State Plaza, facing onto the plaza and towards the New York State Capitol. The museum houses art, artifacts (prehistoric and historic), and ecofacts that reflect New York State’s cultural, natural, and geological development.

==Layout and organization==

The large majority of the museum’s permanent exhibits are located in the voluminous first floor.  Several galleries and halls on the first floor house various temporary art exhibitions, as well as temporary scientific, historical and cultural exhibits.  Presentations and lectures (such as the weekly Lecture Series) are held in the Museum Theater, located near the West Gallery.  A student visitors center is located behind the museum’s main lobby.  The Museum Store, located adjacent to the main lobby, offers souvenirs, high-quality mineral specimens, and selected New York State publications on science, history, and natural history.
The second floor, generally not accessible by the public, contains education and youth services.  The museum’s staff, including the Division of Research and Collections and the Exhibits Division, is located on the third floor, also not accessible to the public.  
The fourth floor contains the museum’s café area, a functioning carousel built between 1912 and 1916 that visitors may ride, and supplementary exhibits covering regional topics and several historic cities in New York State, such as Buffalo and Rochester.  The windowed walls surrounding this floor afford visitors a view of the Empire State Plaza and other areas of downtown Albany, hence the gallery's name, "Windows on New York".
