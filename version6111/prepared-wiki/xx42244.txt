==History==

===Formation and debut releases: 1997–1999===

The origins of the band date back to 1997 when Jordan Pundik (vocals) and Ian Grushka (bass) played together in the band "Inner City Kids" and later "Flip 60".  After disbanding "Flip 60", they recruited Stephen Klein (guitar), who Pundik met at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and had previously played with him in the band "Fallview". The threesome began to jam together. Practicing in Grushka's garage, they later invited Joe "Taco Joe" Marino to play drums. Shortly thereafter, Chad Gilbert (lead guitar), former vocalist of Shai Hulud, joined to complete the quintet.
Pundik later stated the band name was created while he and Klein were working at Red Lobster together; "We came up with A New Found Glory, we wrote it on a napkin. I think we pulled some of it from "A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts" by the Get Up Kids".[tpl]Citation | title = 1996-1997: The Oral History of New Found Glory | url = http://i49.tinypic.com/2vlnqs4.jpg | newspaper = Alternative Press | date = March 2010|author=Manley, Brendan|issue=260|page=63|accessdate=31 January 2010|issn = 1065-1667[/tpl] 
The band recorded their debut EP, It's All About the Girls (1997) in a friend's apartment, and the EP was distributed by local independent label Fiddler Records.  Soon after, Marino was replaced by current drummer Cyrus Bolooki after two rehearsal sessions. The band went on to tour up and down the East Coast and quickly sold out the entire pressing of the EP.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p384007/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=New Found Glory Biography|publisher=Allmusic|author=Ankeny, Jason|accessdate=8 July 2009[/tpl] The band's underground success soon caught the attention of Eulogy Recordings and the quintet subsequently signed shortly afterwards in order to increase distribution of their music.
Following the success of their EP, the band recorded their debut full length album, Nothing Gold Can Stay (1999), initially selling one-page insert copies at their shows supporting NOFX.[tpl]Citation | title = 1999-2000: The Oral History of New Found Glory | url = http://i46.tinypic.com/2rz5rhg.jpg | newspaper = Alternative Press | date = March 2010|author=Manley, Brendan|issue=260|page=64|accessdate=31 January 2010|issn = 1065-1667[/tpl] Richard Reines, co-founder of Drive-Thru Records had also noted their devout following and held talks with the band. Drive-Thru subsequently signed the five-piece and paid Eulogy $5,000 to licence Nothing Gold Can Stay, which went on to sell more than 300,000 copies.

===Rise in popularity and stardom: 2000–2005===

The five-piece signed their first proper record deal with Drive-Thru Records,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ampmagazine.com/index.php/interviews/comments/new_found_glory_shares_insight_on_their_new_upcoming_2009_album|title=New Found Glory Shares insight on their new upcoming 2009 Album|publisher=AMP Magazine|author=Carlton, Liz|accessdate=5 January 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and released an EP of cover songs from film soundtracks entitled From the Screen to Your Stereo in 2000. Drive-Thru's relationship with MCA Records ensured that the smaller label's more popular bands would be picked up by the major. Later that year, debut single "Hit or Miss" peaked at No. 15 on the US Modern Rock Chart,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.popradiotop20.com/Modern-Rock/NewFoundGlory.htm|title=Modern Rock Chart History New Found Glory|publisher=Popradiotop20.com|accessdate=18 August 2009[/tpl] which helped propel the band to a mainstream audience. Subsequently their self-titled second album New Found Glory (2000) reached number one on the Billboard Heatseekers chart,[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r500248/charts-awards|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=New Found Glory > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=16 January 2010[/tpl] and spent 21 weeks on the Billboard 200 chart.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=new found glory|chart=Billboard 200[/tpl]|title=New Found Glory > Chart History|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=18 August 2009[/tpl] In a Kerrang! magazine article years later, they referred to the album as the band's Essential Purchase. They wrote, "marking one of the biggest and quickest improvements in alternative music, the major label debut hurled them to the forefront of the punk scene barely 12 months after its predecessor. Packed with infectious melodies and sing-along anthems, it would see them jostling with the likes of Blink-182 for the genre's crown." The album also marked the official debut of the band's new moniker, which dropped the indefinite article "A" from their original name due to some fans struggling to find the band's records in stores. The album was certified gold by the RIAA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=RIAA Search - New Found Glory|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|accessdate=8 July 2009[/tpl]
Between 2002 and 2004, the band experienced the height of their popularity with headline slots on the Warped Tour with Blink-182 and a supporting tour with Green Day. Third album and major label debut, Sticks and Stones was released on June 11, 2002 and peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 chart. The record spawned two popular singles; "My Friends Over You" and "Head on Collision". Following the success of the album, the band headlined the 2002 Warped Tour and later saw the album certified gold by the RIAA.
The lead single for their fourth album, "All Downhill from Here" reached number eleven in the Rock Chart before Catalyst (2004) was released. The album received positive reviews and peaked at a career-high number three on the Billboard 200, selling 146,000 copies in its first week.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r689863/charts-awards|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Catalyst > Charts & Awards|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=8 July 2009[/tpl] The heavier style of the record, which included some metal and new wave influences,[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r689863/review|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Catalyst > Overview|publisher=Allmusic|author=Loftus, Johnny|accessdate=18 May 2004[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/new-found-glory-moment-glory?page=0,0|title=New Found Glory: Moment of Glory|publisher=Guitar World (Future US Inc.)|author=Di Perna, Alan|date=June 2004|accessdate=25 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/72062-new-found-glory-not-without-a-fight/|title=New Found Glory: Not Without a Fight|publisher=PopMatters|author=Stewart, Bill|date=7 April 2009|accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl] was due to the comparisons that magazines and other media outlets would make between New Found Glory and other popular bands. Chad Gilbert stated: "Well, when Sticks and Stones came out and we were doing that Honda Civic Tour, we were getting compared to bands like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan we were angry with that. At that point, we were getting compared to more pop bands and we aren't a pop band."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=321388 |title= New Found Glory - 04.29.08 - Interview|publisher=AbsolutePunk.net|author=Pham, Jamie|accessdate=27 May 2008[/tpl] The band promoted the album with a supporting tour with Green Day during the fall of 2004 on the American Idiot Tour. The song, "This Disaster", was featured in EA Sports' Madden NFL 2005,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/6199/Madden-NFL-2005-Soundtrack-Revealed/ |title=Madden NFL 2005: Soundtrack Revealed - Xbox |publisher=News.teamxbox.com |date=2004-07-01 |accessdate=2012-08-17[/tpl] and "At Least I'm Known for Something" was featured in EA's Burnout 3: Takedown. This became the band's third record to be certified gold by the RIAA.

===Maturity into later albums: 2006–2009===

Demos for the next album were tracked with long term friend and studio engineer Paul Miner, before the band worked with Thom Panunzio (Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, Ozzy Osbourne) having moved into a house together in Malibu, California called the Morning View Mansion to write and record. Gilbert took into the studio a book containing over 40 riff ideas that were written during the previous tour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=168748|title=Interview with New Found Glory - 09.04.06|publisher=AbsolutePunk.net|author=Tate, Jason|accessdate=4 June 2006[/tpl] Unlike their previous releases, Gilbert and Pundik also worked on lyrics alongside primary lyricist Steve Klein for the first time. The band had decided against working with Neal Avron, who had produced the band's three previous albums, as they wanted to try something different.[tpl]cite news |first=Alan |last=Sculley |title=Hallelujah!: New Found Glory excited about direction of new record|url=http://www.interscope.com/newfoundglory/news|work=The Daily Herald (Lee Enterprises) |date=2 September 2006 |accessdate=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uZFtHonE|archivedate=28 November 2010|deadurl=no[/tpl] Their fifth album titled Coming Home was released on September 19, 2006 with first single, "It's Not Your Fault" in July 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1534322/20060614/new_found_glory.jhtml|title=New Found Glory Find A Home For New Release — September|publisher=MTV|author=Montgomery, James|accessdate=14 June 2006[/tpl] The release proved popular with many critics giving the album positive reviews.

All the members use pseudonyms for their "characters" in the band (e.g. Gilbert is known as "Captain Straightedge"). The band also recorded an internet-only music video for "Dig My Own Grave" with director Joseph Pattisall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=311464 |title=New Found Glory Shoots New Video|publisher=AbsolutePunk.net|author=DeAndrea, Joe|accessdate=12 April 2008[/tpl]

Critics have praised the band for their ability to write infectious hooks and the sincerity of their lyrics, often about growing up and relationships.[tpl]cite web|url=http://prod1.cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=28611|title=New Found Glory: New Found Glory|publisher=CMJ|author= Dabaie, Michael |accessdate=2000-10-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=925922|title=New Found Glory - Not Without a Fight|publisher=AbsolutePunk|author= DeAndrea, Joe|accessdate=8 March 2009[/tpl] Chad Gilbert has noted that, "if the delivery is honest and real, that's what keeps it from being the corniest thing you've ever heard before. New Found Glory is a band that people enjoy listening to not because we give off this harsh message. We write about who we are and what affects us in life and those are our relationships".[tpl]cite web|url=http://musicremedy.com/n/new-found-glory/album/coming-home-3047.html|title=New Found Glory - Coming Home|publisher=Music Remedy|accessdate=12 September 2006[/tpl] Bassist Ian Grushka has stated that "all of the lyrics are based on real life experiences. A song can be created from something one of us is going through or a conversation we've had." While also adding, "We only really talk about personal things that have affected us first-hand, our songs are about emotions rather than some political agenda."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/new_found_glory_guitarist_i_see_coming_home_as_our_first_record.html|title=New Found Glory Guitarist: I See Coming Home As Our First Record|author=Webb, Adam|publisher=Ultimate-Guitar|date=19 October 2006|accessdate=12 December 2010[/tpl] Rhythm guitarist Steve Klein was the band's primary lyricist, while lead guitarist Chad Gilbert is the main composer of the songs. Although since the recording of Coming Home, Klein, Pundik and Gilbert all worked on lyrics together. They have cited hardcore/metalcore bands Hatebreed and Madball, as well as fellow pop punk/punk rock bands Green Day and Blink-182 as major influences on their career.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ampmagazine.com/index.php/interviews/comments/new_found_glory_shares_insight_on_their_new_upcoming_2009_album|title=New Found Glory Shares insight on their new upcoming 2009 Album|publisher=AMP Magazine|accessdate=2009-05-01[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In recent years the band have been cited for their long lasting influence on contemporary pop punk music. Josh Martin, bassist for band The Wonder Years, has claimed that "Influentially, when you think about the top three pop-punk bands of all time...it’s Blink-182, New Found Glory and Green Day. At least in my brain, they’re on that level eternally."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/journal.php?do=showentry&e=346352|title=Alive and Kicking: The Pop Punk’s Not Dead Tour and Why New Found Glory Refuse to Let This Genre Sink|publisher=AbsolutePunk (Buzz Media)|author= Nassiff, Thomas|date=24 October 2011|accessdate=18 March 2012[/tpl] In 2009, Alternative Press included Nothing Gold Can Stay in their "Classic Albums of '99" feature. Brendan Manley wrote, "Like its title implies, Nothing Gold Can Stay is the sonic transcript of a glorious, fleeting time for NFG - and for pop-punk. But just as gold never loses its luster, it's only fitting that 10 years later, Nothing Gold Can Stay still shines".[tpl]Citation | title = 10 Classic Albums of '99 - A New Found Glory: Nothing Gold Can Stay | url = http://www.flickr.com/photos/42277775@N03/3907618123/sizes/o/ | newspaper = Alternative Press | date = September 2009|author=Manley, Brendan|issue=254|page=65|accessdate=11 September 2009|issn = 1065-1667[/tpl] Likewise, Jason Heller of The A.V. Club reflected how their debut "snuck beneath the radar to become a massive influence on the new millennium’s eruption of pop-punk."
