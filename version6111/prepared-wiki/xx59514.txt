===S.J. and Jessie E. Quinney College of Natural Resources===

USU has a long and illustrious history in the science and management of forests, rangeland, wildlife, and fisheries and watersheds.  Many graduates of the Quinney College of Natural Resources have gone on to high-level careers in the National Forest Service, National Park Service, and the Bureau of Land Management, and its graduate programs attract high numbers of international students.  The college also operates the Quinney Library, which houses collections relevant for natural resources education, management, and research. The college was formally renamed the S.J. and Jessie E. Quinney College of Natural Resources in 2012 after a $10 million donation was received by the S.J. and Jessie E. Quinney Foundation. The Quinneys were both graduates of USU (then the Agricultural College of Utah), and their foundation has supported the College of Natural Resources for 40 years, contributing more than $40 million in all.http://usu.edu/ust/index.cfm?article=51639
The Quinney College of Natural Resources includes the departments of Watershed Sciences, Environment and Society, and Wildland Resources.
