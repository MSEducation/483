==Amateur career==

He was a part of the Green Archers team who completed their quest for four-peat by defeating Ateneo in the 2001 UAAP Finals.http://www.goarchers.com/11676/poll-the-best-dlsu-mens-basketball-champion-team  From a UAAP rookie year in 2001 where he averaged of 3.4 points, 1.5 rebounds, 1.5 rebounds, and 9.5 minutes per game, he improved this to an average statline of 11.3 points, 3.3 rebounds, 2.4 assists, and 23.3 minutes in the 2004 Season.

==Professional career==

Yeo, nicknamed The Ninja, was drafted by the defunct Coca-Cola Tigers as third overall pick in 2006, just behind Kelly Williams and Arwind Santos.  As a rookie, he played limited minutes as a reliever to Tiger’s main-man John Arigo. Despite the limited playing time, he still managed to average 10 ppg, 4.6 rpg and 1.2 apg in 26 minutes per contest halfway into the elimination round of the 2006-07 PBA Philippine Cup. However, this did not stop critics from calling him a bust and attribute this to his lacking in size to play the two-spot.
In 2007, he was traded, along with a future draft pick, to Sta. Lucia for former FEU forwards Mark Isip and Cesar Catli.http://www.air21express.com.ph/joseph-yeo/  As a Realtor, he effectively played
his off-the-bench role, winding up as the team’s second-best scorer behind Kelly Williams with a 13.5-point average,https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/xpatsna/conversations/topics/640 and became a vital cog of the team that won the 2007-08 PBA Philippine Cup.
In 2010, he was dealt to San Miguel for Bonbon Custodio.http://www.ianmedina.com/2010/03/confirmed-joseph-yeo-to-san-miguel-for.html  While playing for the Beermen, he spent most of his time on the bench and in the injured list, and was not able to play for the team who won the 2011 PBA Governors Cup Championship.http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/08/21/11/petron-takes-game-7-wins-pba-governors-cup
Seeking for a fresh start, he was shipped to Air21 Express in a one-on-one swap with Mark Isip.http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/pba-approves-joseph-yeo-deal-from-petron-to-air-21-for-mark-isip He has since reunited with his college coach Franz Pumaren and college teammate Mark Cardona.http://sports.inquirer.net/118877/petron-air21-swap-yeo-isip  During the 2013-14 PBA Philippine Cup, he switched his role from shooting guard to point guard during the absence of Simon Atkins.http://www.solarsportsdesk.ph/bk/bknews/2014/01/09/joseph-yeo-as-point-guard-working-wonders-for-air21 He has since switched back to his natural two-guard position once Simon Atkins returned from injury and after the team acquired a true point guard in Jonas Villanueva.

==Personal life==

He married Angela Medalla on May 27, 2008,http://slrarchives.blogspot.com/2008/04/theres-no-sukob-for-yeo-williams.html and their baby named Mariana Zaria M. Yeo was born on September 3, 2008 and on January 2012, another baby girl, named Helena, was born.http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/ninja-kid-new-baby-daughter-brings-joseph-yeo-sweet-inspiration

==Feud with Enrico Villanueva==

Yeo was notable for his on and off-court feud with college rival, former King Eagle and now teammate Enrico Villanueva.  During the PBA-sanctioned Ateneo-La Salle Dream Games in December 2005, he elbowed Villanueva at the forehead as the latter was getting the ball rebounds.http://www.oritoday.pp.ua/ori.php?v=jbK_-TexOm8&feature=youtube_gdata_player&titl=Joseph%20Yeo%20Punches%20Villanueva%20Ateneo%20vs%20La%20Salle%202005%20Dream%20Game%20Fight%20UAAP%20PBA In 2006, another incident happened pitting the two rivals was after the game between his team Coca-Cola and Villanueva's Red Bull, when they engaged in a parking lot brawl.  They were both summoned by then PBA Commissioner Noli Eala.  Yeo has since apologized to Villanueva.http://www.bncxe.org/showthread.php?19160-Enrico-Villanueva-vs-Joseph-Yeo
When Villanueva was recently traded to Air21 in March 2014, he clarified that their old quarrel has long been a thing of the past.http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/ok-na-kami-joseph-yeo-says-quarrel-with-enrico-villanueva-a-thing-of-the-past
