[[Fermat's principle]]

CATEGORIES: Geometrical optics, Calculus of variations, Principles

In optics, Fermat's principle or the principle of least time is the principle that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.  This principle is sometimes taken as the definition of a ray of light.Arthur Schuster, An Introduction to the Theory of Optics, London: Edward Arnold, 1904 online. However, this version of the principle is not general; a more modern statement of the principle is that rays of light traverse the path of stationary optical length with respect to variations of the path. In other words, a ray of light prefers the path such that there are other paths, arbitrarily nearby on either side, along which the ray would take almost exactly the same time to traverse.[tpl]Citation|last=Feynman|first=Richard|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 1|pages=26–7[/tpl] 
Fermat's principle can be used to describe the properties of light rays reflected off mirrors, refracted through different media, or undergoing total internal reflection. It follows mathematically from Huygens' principle (at the limit of small wavelength).  Fermat's text Analyse des réfractions exploits the technique of adequality to derive Snell's law of refraction[ref]
