[[Fundamental attribution error]]

CATEGORIES: Cognitive biases, Attitude attribution, Social psychology

In social psychology, the fundamental attribution error, also known as the correspondence bias or attribution effect, is people's tendency to place an undue emphasis on internal characteristics to explain someone else's behavior in a given situation, rather than considering external factors. It does not explain interpretations of one's own behavior, where situational factors are more easily recognized and can thus be taken into consideration. The flip side of this error is the actor–observer bias, in which people tend to overemphasize the role of a situation in their behaviors and underemphasize the role of their own personalities. 
As a simple example, consider a situation where Alice, a driver, is about to pass through an intersection. Her light turns green and she begins to accelerate, but another car drives through the red light and crosses in front of her. The fundamental attribution error may lead her to think that the driver of the other car was an unskilled or reckless driver. This will be an error if the other driver had a good reason for running the light, such as rushing a patient to the hospital. If this is the case and Alice had been driving the other car, she would have understood that the situation called for speed at the cost of safety, but when seeing it from the outside she was inclined to believe that the behavior of the other driver reflected their fundamental nature (having poor driving skills or a reckless attitude).
The phrase was coined by Lee Ross[tpl]cite book |last=Ross |first=L. |year=1977 |chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process |editor-first=L. |editor-last=Berkowitz |title=Advances in experimental social psychology |volume=10 |pages=173–220 |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-015210-X [/tpl] some years after a now classic experiment by Edward E. Jones and Victor Harris (1967).[tpl]cite journal |last=Jones |first=E. E. |last2=Harris |first2=V.

Jones wrote that he found Ross' phrase "overly provocative and somewhat misleading", and also joked: "Furthermore, I'm angry that I didn't think of it first." Some psychologists, including Daniel Gilbert, have used the phrase "correspondence bias" for the fundamental attribution error.[tpl]cite book |last=Gilbert |first=D.

==Classic demonstration study: Jones and Harris (1967)==

Jones and Harris hypothesized, based on the correspondent inference theory, that people would attribute apparently freely-chosen behaviors to disposition, and apparently chance-directed behaviors to situation. The hypothesis was confounded by the fundamental attribution error.
Subjects read essays for and against Fidel Castro, and were asked to rate the pro-Castro attitudes of the writers. When the subjects believed that the writers freely chose the positions they took (for or against Castro), they naturally rated the people who spoke in favor of Castro as having a more positive attitude towards Castro. However, contradicting Jones and Harris' initial hypothesis, when the subjects were told that the writer's positions were determined by a coin toss, they still rated writers who spoke in favor of Castro as having, on average, a more positive attitude towards Castro than those who spoke against him. In other words, the subjects were unable to properly see the influence of the situational constraints placed upon the writers; they could not refrain from attributing sincere belief to the writers.

==Explanations==

There is no universally accepted explanation for the fundamental attribution error. Here are several hypotheses of the causes of the error:

==Cultural differences in the error==

Generally, the fundamental attribution error has been researched central to a social cognitive framework.[tpl]clarify|date=February 2013[/tpl] Barring this, however, there are many cultural differences which arise when attempting to explain this error.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lagdridge|first=Darren|coauthors=Trevor Butt|title=The fundamental attribution error: A phenomenological critique|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|date=September 2004|volume=43|issue=3|pages=357–369[/tpl] Previous research has shown that cultural differences exist in the susceptibility of making fundamental attribution error: people from individualistic cultures are more prone to the error while people from collectivistic cultures are less prone.[tpl]cite journal |last=Miller |first=J. G. |year=1984 |title=Culture and the development of everyday social explanation |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=961–978 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.5.961 [/tpl] 
It has been found that there is a differential attention to social factors between independent peoples and interdependent peoples in both social and nonsocial contexts. Takahiko Masuda and his colleagues (2004) in their cartoon figure presentation experiment showed that Japanese people's judgments on the target character's facial expression are more influenced by surrounding faces than those of the Americans,[tpl]Cite journal|last=Masuda |first=T. |last2=Ellsworth |first2=P. C. |last3=Mesquita |first3=B. |last3=Leu |first3=J. |last4=van de Veerdonk |first4=E. |year=2004 |title=A face in the crowd or a crowd in the face: Japanese and American perceptions of others’ emotions |publisher=Unpublished manuscript, Hokkaido University [/tpl] whereas Masuda and Nisbett (2001) concluded from their underwater scenes animated cartoon experiment that Americans are also more likely than Japanese participants to mark references to focal objects (i.e. fish) instead of contexts (i.e. rocks and plants).[tpl]cite journal |last=Masuda |first=T. |last2=Nisbett |first2=R. E. |year=2001 |title=Attending holistically vs. analytically: Comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=922–934 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.922 [/tpl] These discrepancies in the salience of different factors to people from different cultures suggest that Asians tend to attribute behavior to situation while Westerners attribute the same behavior to the actor. Consistently, Morris & Peng (1994) found from their fish behavior attribution experiment that more American than Chinese participants perceive the behavior (e.g. an individual fish swimming in front of a group of fish) as internally rather than externally caused.[tpl]cite journal |last=Morris |first=M. W. |last2=Peng |first2=K. |year=1994 |title=Culture and cause: American and Chinese attributions for social and physical events |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=949–971 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.949 [/tpl] 
One explanation for this difference in attribution lies in the way in which people of different cultural orientation perceive themselves in the environment. Particularly, Markus and Kitayama (1991) mentioned how (individualistic) Westerners tend to see themselves as independent agents and therefore focus more on individual objects rather than contextual details.[tpl]cite journal |last=Markus |first=H. R. |last2=Kitayama |first2=S. |year=1991 |title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation |journal=Psychological Review |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=224–253 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224 [/tpl]

==Versus correspondence bias==

The fundamental attribution error is commonly used interchangeably with "correspondence bias" (sometimes called "correspondence inference", although this phrase refers to a natural judgment that does not necessarily constitute a bias, whereas bias arises when the inference drawn is incorrect, e.g., dispositional inference when the actual cause is situational). However, there has been debate about whether the two terms should be further distinguished from each other. Three main differences between these two judgmental processes have been argued:
Based on the preceding differences between causal attribution and correspondence inference, some researchers argue that the fundamental attribution error should be considered as the tendency to make dispositional rather than situational explanations for behavior, whereas the correspondence bias should be considered as the tendency to draw correspondent dispositional inferences from behavior.Hamilton, D. L. (1998). Dispositional and attributional inferences in person perception. In J. M. Darley & J. Cooper (Eds. [tpl]what|date=May 2013[/tpl]), Attribution and social interaction (pp. 99-114). Washington, DC, American Psychological Association.Krull, D. S. (2001). On partitioning the fundamental attribution error: Dispositionalism and the correspondence bias. In G. B. Moskowitz (Ed. [tpl]what|date=May 2013[/tpl]), Cognitive social psychology (pp. 211–227). Mahwah, New Jersey, USA, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. With such distinct definitions between the two, some cross-cultural studies also found that cultural differences of correspondence bias are not equivalent to those of fundamental attribution error. While the latter has been found to be more prevalent in individualistic cultures than collectivistic cultures, correspondence bias occurs across cultures,Masuda, T., & Kitayama, S. (1996). Culture-specificity of correspondence bias: Dispositional inference in Japan.
