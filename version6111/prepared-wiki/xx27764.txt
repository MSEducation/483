Anem ([tpl]lang-he|עין גנים[/tpl], Ein Ganim, lit. Garden Spring) - two fountains, a Levitical city in the tribe of Issachar (1 Chr.6:73). It is also called En-gannim in Josh. 19:21; the modern Jenin.
It "seems" to "Ein Ganim"/Jenin (KJV and RV "En-gannim") only because it appears in approximately the same position in the parallel list of Issachar areas in Joshua 19:21, 21:29.  But others note that it is a distinct site, "Anim"; albeit near En-gannim.  [e.g., Martino (Ed.). Atlas Biblicus.  Paris (Suptibus P. Lethielleux, 1907).  "urbs tribus Issachar, fortasse eadem atque Engannim (Djenin) vel probabilius urbs distincta, vicus ‘Anim inter aquilonem et occidentum ab Engannim.
