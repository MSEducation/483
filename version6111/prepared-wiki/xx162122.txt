Trancid was launched on March 31, 2006 over the subcarrier channel of Top 40 Mainstream WAKS/Cleveland, Ohio (who now carries the Club Phusion format) and offered a playlist that is mostly made up of current Trance, Techno, Electronica and Dance tracks, all commercial-free and jockless 24/7. It also expanded the format to sister station KIKI-FM/Honolulu as well. But in June 2008 the format was eliminated and its music was cominbed into the Club Phusion format.
