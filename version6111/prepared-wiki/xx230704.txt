==History==

The club was promoted to Liga Artzit (then the second division) in 1996. They were relegated back to the third tier at the end of the 1998-99 season, and narrowly missed a second straight relegation when finishing third from bottom in 1999-2000. The following season the club returned to the second tier (now named Liga Leumit) when they finished as runners-up in Liga Artzit, and would have won the title had it not been for two points being deducted for player violence and a violation of the budget rules. In the same season, they also won the Liga Artzit Toto Cup.
In 2002-03 Kafr Kanna were relegated back to Liga Artzit, where they have remained until their relegation to Liga Alef in the end of the 2008-09 season.
