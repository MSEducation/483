"If You're Reading This" is a song by American country music artist Tim McGraw. The song was first performed at the Academy of Country Music (ACM) awards, which were held in Las Vegas, Nevada and aired May 15, 2007 on CBS.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5547858,00.html  |title=News: Headlines: Tim McGraw's Special Tribute |accessdate=2007-05-31 |format= |work=Great American Country[/tpl] Shortly after McGraw's live performance, several radio stations began playing a telecast of the song, boosting it to a debut at number 35 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts from unsolicited airplay. A remixed version of the live recording was later released to radio as a single, overlapping Tim's then-current single, "I Need You", (a duet with wife Faith Hill).
In November 2007, "If You're Reading This" reached a peak of number 3 on the Billboard country charts, becoming McGraw's forty-second Top Ten country hit overall. The song also peaked at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100.

McGraw co-wrote the song, with Brad and Brett Warren of country duo The Warren Brothers, approximately three weeks before the ACM awards aired.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5560359,00.html |title=News: Headlines: Tim McGraw Song Remains TV Moment |accessdate=2007-05-31 |format= |work=Great American Country[/tpl] The three were inspired by reading a magazine article on war casualties.
When McGraw performed the song at the ACM awards show, one hundred relatives of soldiers joined him onstage, under a banner that read "Families of Fallen Heroes". After performing the song, he received a standing ovation.

==Chart performance==

Despite the lack of a studio recording, the song received airplay on country radio after several stations began playing the CBS telecast of McGraw's live performance.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1560539/20070525/wilson_gretchen.jhtml |title=CMT.com : News : ACM Exposure Fails to Bolster Superstars' CD Sales |accessdate=2007-05-31 |format= |work=CMT.com[/tpl] As a result, it entered Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart at number 35.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.the9513.com/tim-mcgraws-if-youre-reading-this-is-in-high-demand/ |title=Tim McGraw's "If You're Reading This" Is In High Demand |accessdate=2007-05-31 |format= |work=The 9513[/tpl] Scott Siman, McGraw's manager, had been working with both the label (Curb Records) and radio stations to "address the fact that we don't have a studio recorded version of this song". A remixed version (with most of the audience noise removed, except for applause at the end) was released to radio in June 2007, while McGraw's then-current single "I Need You" (a Faith Hill duet) was also climbing the charts.[ref]
