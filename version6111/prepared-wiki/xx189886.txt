Eyes of the World is the third studio album by guitarist Tony MacAlpine, released in 1990 through PolyGram. Titled under the group name "MacAlpine", the album is a departure from his previous work in that it is more commercially oriented; there are no instrumental tracks and it is stylistically closer to hard rock than neo-classical metal.
