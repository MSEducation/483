</ref> and although the [[grandiloquence]] of his literary style was on occasion mocked by some of his peers,<ref>Porph. ''Hor. Serm.'' 1.10.53</ref> he continued to be cited by other writers long after his death.<ref name="OCD"/>
Accius wrote other works of a literary character: Libri Didascalicon, a treatise in verse on the history of Greek and Roman poetry, and dramatic art in particular; also Libri Pragmaticon, Parerga, and Praxidica, of which no fragments remain; and a hexameter Annales containing the history of Rome, like that of Ennius.

==As a grammarian==

Accius also attempted to introduce innovations in Latin orthography and grammar, most of which were attempts to change written Latin to more faithfully reproduce its actual pronunciation.  Few of these caught on, although his preference against giving Greek names Latin endings had quite a few supporters, particularly Varro, who dedicated his De antiquitate litterarum to Accius.Varro, De lingua Latina 10.70
A spelling convention of writing long vowels double (such as aa for long ƒÅ) is also associated with him, and is found in texts concurrent with his lifetime [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl].

==Politics and temperament==

Accius was politically conservative, and generally noted for his dignity and reserve.  He did however believe that one with literary gifts, such as himself, ought to be accorded more respect than someone who, through no effort of their own, was merely born to nobility.  He was, by some accounts, a self-important man,Rhetorica ad Herennium 1.24 and some writers expressed a wry amusement at the larger-than-life statues of himself he had erected in the temple of the Muses.Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia 34.19
Atreus featured the line oderint dum metuant ("let them hate, so long as they fear"), later an infamous motto of Caligula.
