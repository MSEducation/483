Methanobrevibacter filiformis is a species of methanogen archaeon.[tpl]cite journal |author=Leadbetter JR, Crosby LD, Breznak JA |title=Methanobrevibacter filiformis sp. nov., A filamentous methanogen from termite hindguts |journal=Archives of Microbiology |volume=169 |issue=4 |pages=287â€“92 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9531629 |doi= |url=http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00203/papers/8169004/81690287.pdf |issn= |accessdate=2013-08-07[/tpl] It was first isolated from the hindgut of the termite Reticulitermes flavipes. It is rod-shaped and possesses polar fibers. Its morphology, gram-positive staining reaction, resistance to cell lysis by chemical agents and narrow range of utilisable substracts are typical of species belonging to the family Methanobacteriaceae. It habitates on or near the hindgut epithelium and also attached to filamentous prokaryotes associated with the gut wall. It is one of the predominant gut biota.
