[[Gravelines Nuclear Power Station]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear power stations in France

The Gravelines Nuclear Power Station is the fifth largest nuclear power station in the world, the second largest in Europe (after the nuclear power station of Zaporizhia, Ukraine) and the largest in Western Europe. It is located in Nord, France, approximately [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from Dunkerque and Calais. Its cooling water comes from the North Sea. The plant houses 6 nuclear reactors with a unitary power of 900 MW. In 2006 the plant produced 38.14 TWh, 8,1% of the whole amount of electricity produced in France. Two reactors entered service in 1980, two in 1981, and two in 1985.
The site employs 1680 regular employees. As of the 2nd of August 2010, it became the first nuclear station anywhere in the world to produce over one thousand terawatt-hour of electricity.
The design for Gravelines units 5 and 6 was the basis for the Chinese CPR-1000 design.http://www.iaea.or.at/NuclearPower/Downloads/Technology/meetings/2011-Jul-4-8-ANRT-WS/1_CHINA_CPR1000_CGNPC_S.Lau.pdf CPR1000 Design, Safety Performance and Operability, slide 16

==Cooling Water==

The cooling water that carries waste heat from the plant is used by a local commune of aquafarmers who raise European seabass and gilt-head breams. The warm water helps them grow faster.
