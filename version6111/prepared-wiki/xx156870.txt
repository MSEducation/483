"Quark" (meaning "rubbish", literally curd) is a punk song by Die Ärzte. It's the fourteenth track and the fourth single from their 1993 album Die Bestie in Menschengestalt. It's about a man, who can't handle the chattering of his consort. The single version criticises the gibberish of politicians. The single version is also on "Das Beste von kurz nach früher bis jetze".

==The video==

In the video the single version of the song is sung. The video features the band in a bar with hillbillies and women with deep cleavage. The supposed members of the band are also dressed like hillbillies and they're eating curd while watching politicians, who are in fact the real band members, talking on TV. Also people in the bar are playing with food and throwing it at the TV-set.
