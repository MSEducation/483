Christine McVie (born Anne Christine Perfect, 12 July 1943) is an English singer-songwriter and keyboardist. Her fame came as a member of rock band Fleetwood Mac. Eight songs written and sung by McVie are on the band's Greatest Hits album, including "Don't Stop", "Little Lies", "Everywhere" and "You Make Loving Fun". She has also released three solo albums. AllMusic critic Steve Leggett noted McVie's "naturally smoky low alto vocal style", describing her as an "Unabashedly easy-on-the-ears singer/songwriter, and the prime mover behind some of Fleetwood Mac's biggest hits."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/christine-mcvie-mn0000123915/biography|title=Christine McVie: Biography|last=Leggett|first=Steve|website=AllMusic|accessdate=23 February 2014[/tpl]
In 1998, as a member of Fleetwood Mac, McVie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Since retiring from the band, she has worked on solo material in her converted barn at her home in Wickhambreaux in Kent. McVie appeared on stage with Fleetwood Mac at London's O2 Arena in September 2013, and rejoined the band in January 2014.

==Early life==

Christine was born in the small village of Bouth in the Lake District of England[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.findmypast.co.uk/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp |title=Marriages and Births England and Wales 1837–2006 |publisher=Findmypast.co.uk|date= |accessdate=3 January 2011[/tpl] and grew up in the Bearwood area of Smethwick near Birmingham, where her father, Cyril P.A. Perfect, was a concert violinist and music lecturer at St Peter's College of Education, Saltley, Birmingham and taught violin at St Philip's Grammar School, Birmingham. Christine's mother Beatrice E.M. (called Tee) née Reece, was a medium, psychic, and faith healer. Christine's grandfather had been an organist at Westminster Abbey.[tpl]cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=11&c=2 |title=Christine McVie |publisher=Contemporary Keyboard |date=October 1980 |last=Doerschuk |first=Bob[/tpl]
Although Christine was introduced to the piano at age four, it was not until age eleven that she studied music seriously, when she was re-introduced to piano by Philip Fisher, a local musician and school friend of Christine's older brother John.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Continuing her classical training until age 15, Christine radically shifted her musical focus to rock & roll when John brought home a Fats Domino songbook.[tpl]cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=942&c=2 |title=Christine McVie: Life After Fleetwood Mac |publisher=Sunday Express |date=27 June 2004[/tpl] Other early influences included The Everly Brothers.

==Early music==

McVie studied sculpture at an art college in Birmingham for five years, with the goal of becoming an art teacher. During that time she met a number of budding musicians in Britain's blues scene.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Her first foray into the music field didn't come until she met two friends, Stan Webb and Andy Silvester in a pub one night. At the time, they were playing in a band called "Sounds Of Blue" which had a few dates booked, but no bass guitarist. Knowing that Christine had musical talent, they asked her to join.Disc Magazine (11/08–15/1969), Who's Perfect? Also, during that time, she often sang with Spencer Davis. After five years, Christine graduated from art college with a teaching degree, but by that time "Sounds of Blue" had split up.
Fresh out of art college, McVie found she did not have enough money to launch herself into the art world, so she moved to London, where she worked briefly as a department store window dresser.

===Chicken Shack===

In 1967 Christine learned that her ex-band mates, Andy Silvester and Stan Webb, were forming a blues band, Chicken Shack, and were looking for a pianist. She wrote to them asking to join, and they invited her to play keyboards/piano and to sing background vocals. Chicken Shack's debut release was "It's Okay With Me Baby", written by and featuring McVie. She stayed with Chicken Shack for two albums, during which her genuine feel for the blues became evident, not only in her Sonny Thompson-style piano playing, but through her authentic "bluesy" voice.Fleetwood Mac, by Steve Clarke, Proteus Books, 1984, p. 47  Chicken Shack had a hit with "I'd Rather Go Blind", which featured Christine on lead vocals.Fleetwood Mac, by Steve Clarke, Proteus Books, 1984, p. 48 Perfect received a Melody Maker award for female vocalist in both 1969 and 1970. McVie left Chicken Shack in 1969 after meeting Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie.

==Fleetwood Mac==

Christine was a fan of Fleetwood Mac at the time; and while touring with Chicken Shack, the two bands often would meet. They also were "label mates" at Blue Horizon, and Fleetwood Mac had asked Christine to play piano as a session musician for Peter Green's songs on the band's second album, Mr. Wonderful.Mike Vernon's CD Booklet, Fleetwood Mac: The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions 1967-1969, Chapter 2
Encouraged to continue her career, Christine recorded a solo album, Christine Perfect; following her success as a member of Fleetwood Mac, the album was reissued under the name The Legendary Christine Perfect Album. After marrying Fleetwood Mac bass guitarist John McVie, Christine joined Fleetwood Mac in 1970. She had already contributed backup vocals and painted the cover for Kiln House. The band had just lost founding member Peter Green, and its members were nervous about touring without him. Christine had been a huge fan of the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac; and since she knew all the lyrics to their songs, she went along.[tpl]cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=1048&c=2 |title=Goldmine Magazine 1992 interview[/tpl]
The early 1970s was a rocky time for the band, with a revolving door of musicians; and only the albums Bare Trees and Mystery to Me, scored any successes.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Furthermore, a group impersonating Fleetwood Mac (which later became Stretch) was touring the United States with encouragement from the band's manager, Clifford Davis. The tour collapsed, but it led to a protracted lawsuit between Davis and Fleetwood Mac (or Stretch?)."Bob Brunning – Fleetwood Mac: Behind The Masks", Hodder & Stoughton, 1990.
In 1974 McVie reluctantly agreed to move with the rest of Fleetwood Mac to the U.S. and make a fresh start. Within a year Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham of Buckingham Nicks joined the band, giving it an added dimension. Their first album together, 1975's Fleetwood Mac, had several hit songs, with McVie's "Over My Head" and "Say You Love Me", both reaching Billboard's top-20 singles chart. It was "Over My Head" which first put Fleetwood Mac on American radio and into the national Top 20.Fleetwood Mac, by Steve Clarke, Proteus Books, 1984, p. 92
In 1976 McVie began an on-the-road affair with the band's lighting director,[tpl]cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=208&c=18 |title=Five Go Mad |publisher=Uncut Magazine |date=May 2003[/tpl] which inspired her to write "You Make Loving Fun", a top-10 hit on the landmark smash Rumours, one of the best-selling albums of all-time. Her biggest hit was "Don't Stop", which climbed all the way to number three. The Rumours tour also included McVie's "Songbird", a ballad played as the encore of many Fleetwood Mac concerts.
By the end of the Rumours tour, the McVies were divorced. The 1979 double album Tusk produced three more US top-20 hits ("Tusk", which is also the band's first "conceptual" music video,[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] "Sara", and Christine's "Think About Me"), but it came nowhere near to matching the success of the Rumours album.[tpl]cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=13&c=2 |title=Mac's McVie: Rumours Fly About Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie—And That's No Mirage |publisher=US Magazine |date=25 September 1982[/tpl] The Tusk tour continued into 1980 after which the band took time apart. They reunited in 1981 to record the album Mirage at the Château d'Hérouville's studio in France. The album, released in 1982, returned the band to the top of the US charts and also contained the top-5 hit "Hold Me", co-written by McVie. McVie's inspiration for the song was her tortured relationship with Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson.Fleetwood, Mick & Stephen Davis. My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac. Avon Books, 1991.  Her song, "Love in Store", became the third single from the album peaking at #22 in early 1983."Love In Store"/"Can't Go Back" single page at FleetwoodMac.net Discography
In 1984 McVie recorded another solo album. She created hits with the songs "Got a Hold on Me" (Top 10 pop and #1 adult contemporary) and "Love Will Show Us How" (#30). A Third single, "I'm The One", was released but did not chart. McVie is quoted in The Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits as saying of her solo album, "Maybe it isn't the most adventurous album in the world, but I wanted to be honest and please my own ears with it."Connelly, Christopher. "From British Blues with Chicken Shack to Soft Rock with Fleetwood Mac: Christine McVie Keeps a Level Head after Two Decades in the Fast Lane." Rolling Stone, 7 June 1984
McVie also met keyboardist, Eddy Quintela (12 years her junior), whom she married on 18 October 1986. Quintela went on to co-write many songs with her that were featured on subsequent Fleetwood Mac albums. The couple divorced in the mid-1990s. She rejoined Fleetwood Mac to record the Tango in the Night album, which went on to become the band's biggest success since Rumours ten years earlier. The biggest hit from the album which was top 5 in both the UK and US, was McVie's "Little Lies", co-written with her husband Quintela. Another McVie single from the album, "Everywhere", reached #4 in the UK, which would be the band's third highest ever chart peak there and their final top 40 UK hit to date (the single peaked at #14 in the US).Fleetwood Mac UK singles positions at Chart Stats
In 1990 the band (now without Lindsey Buckingham) recorded Behind the Mask, but the album only reached 'Gold' status in the U.S.,Recording Industry Association of America sales figures. Certified 'Gold' on 19 July 1990. and only McVie's song "Save Me" made the U.S. Top 40. The album did, however, enter the UK album chart at #1 and reached Platinum status there. The second US single release from the album, McVie's "Skies the Limit" did not make the top
100, but did chart the A/C at number 10.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] McVie had always been reluctant to go on concert tours, preferring to stay close to home with friends and family.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] Upon the death of her father, Cyril Perfect, while she was touring for Behind the Mask, McVie made the decision to retire from touring altogether.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Despite the departure of Stevie Nicks, McVie remained loyal to Mick Fleetwood and her former husband John McVie, writing and recording a new track ("Love Shines") for the 1992 boxed set 25 Years - The Chain, and five songs for the band's 1995 album Time.
The members of the band seemed to have gone their separate ways until Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, and Lindsey Buckingham got together again for one of Buckingham's solo projects. Christine was soon asked to sing and play on some of the tracks. The four of them decided a full reunion was possible and Stevie Nicks was called back into the fold and the resulting live album, 1997's The Dance, went to #1 in the US album charts. Despite her reservations,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Christine complied with the band's touring schedule, and then performed for the group's 1998 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the Grammy Awards show, and the BRIT Awards in the UK.  Christine later revealed (in a 2014 "Rolling Stone" interview) that she had developed a phobia about flying, which was later treated with psychotherapy.  This phobia was the reason she decided not to continue with Fleetwood Mac after 1998.
In 2006 Paste magazine named McVie, together with bandmates, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, as the 83rd greatest living songwriter or songwriting team."Paste's 100 Best Living Songwriters: The List" Paste magazine, 8 June 2006

We love her, so we had to let her go."Christine McVie will never rejoin Fleetwood Mac 6 December 2012
