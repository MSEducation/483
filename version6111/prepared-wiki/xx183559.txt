==Career==

McCormack began his playing career in 1976 with Clydebank, making over 100 league appearances and scoring 24 times before joining St. Mirren in 1980. While playing for St. Mirren, McCormack acquired the nickname "Cowboy", because he had the same name as a professional boxer with that nickname.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2010CSOH124.html |title=John Duffy McCormack v. Hamilton Academical Football Club |date=1 September 2010 |accessdate=2 September 2010 |publisher=Court of Session[/tpl] He moved to Dundee in 1984 before returning to the west of Scotland in 1986, spending single seasons with Airdrieonians and Partick Thistle before retiring in 1988.
Following his retirement from playing, McCormack was employed by Glasgow City Council for several years, working in sports centres in the city. He then returned to Dundee as a youth coach, before progressing to assistant manager and becoming manager in 1997. Just months later, McCormack was sacked – despite Dundee leading the Scottish Football League First Division – and went on to join Queen's Park.
