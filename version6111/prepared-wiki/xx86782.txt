Øre (plural øre, [tpl]IPA-no|ˈøːɾə[/tpl]) is the centesimal subdivision of the Norwegian and Danish krones. The Faroese division is called the oyra, but is equal in value to the Danish coin. Before their discontinuation, the corresponding divisions of the Swedish krona and the Icelandic króna were the öre and the eyrir, respectively. In all five languages, the name derives from the Latin aureus,http://www.dokpro.uio.no/perl/ordboksoek/ordbok.cgi?OPP=%F8re&begge=S%F8k+i+begge+ordb%F8kene&ordbok=begge&s=n a gold coin worth 25 denarii.
