Dork Tower is an online comic created, written and drawn by John Kovalic. It chronicles the lives of a group of geeks living in the fictional town of Mud Bay, Wisconsin.  Mud Bay's design is strongly influenced by the author's home town of Madison, Wisconsin.  Topics have included role-playing games (RPGs), comic books, video games, and fandom in general.  The comic strip began in January 1997[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/comics/dorktower/page.asp?id=7| title=Dork Tower FAQs| last=Kovalic| first=John| accessdate=2007-10-16[/tpl] and has made appearances in publications like Dragon magazine, Shadis, and Comic Shop News.  Starting in 2000, the strip began web publication roughly three times a week and is featured in Pyramid. The bimonthly comic book made its first appearance in 1998 and features continuing storylines.  It has recently gone to full color with issue #32, and it is collected in trade paperback.
During its first year in Dragon, Dork Tower was called Shop Keep, making the comics focusing on Bill Blyden and Pegasaurus Games a separate series from the comics focusing on Matt and his group that were published elsewhere (although the Dork Tower cast, especially Igor, also appeared in Shop Keep as customers). This was later discontinued, and subsequent Pegasaurus-based strips were also titled Dork Tower. The name is a cacographic of both Stephen King's The Dark Tower and the Judges Guild Advanced Dungeons & Dragons module Dark Tower.

==Cast of characters==

Dork Tower's central characters are a group of people who play games as a hobby, including role-playing games and miniatures games, and some also participate in live action role-playing games. The comic primarily chronicles the ins-and-outs of the gaming world (typically exaggerating stereotypes of gamers for comic effect).
