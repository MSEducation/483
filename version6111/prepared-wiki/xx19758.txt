</ref> We even have [[Punxsutawney Phil]], the famous groundhog, who tells us whether or not we can expect a longer winter or an early spring. Bayes theorem tells us the difference between who’s on a hot streak and who is what they claim to be. 
Let’s say we live in an area where everyone gambles on the outcome of coin flips. Because of that, there is a big business for predicting coin flips. Suppose that 5% of predictors can actually win in the long run, and 80% of those are winners over a 2-year period.  95% of predictors are pretenders who are just guessing, and 20% of them are winners over a 2-year period (everyone gets lucky once in a while). This means that 82.6% of bettors who are winners over a 2-year period are actually long-term losers who are winning above their real average.

==History==

Bayes' theorem was named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes (1701–61), who studied how to compute a distribution for the probability parameter of a binomial distribution (in modern terminology). His friend Richard Price edited and presented this work in 1763, after Bayes' death, as An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances.[ref]
