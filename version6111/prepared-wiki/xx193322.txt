Studios 301 has a long and distinguished history, starting with the 1928 recording of the arrival of [[Charles 
Kingsford Smith]] and Charles Ulm into Australia following their flight from America, the first flight of 
its kind. In 1932, 
the studio recorded another first, a landline recording of the Melbourne Cup, and in 1954, the recording of the 
first symphony in Australia (John Antille's 'Ballet Suite' with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra).name=Studios301>[tpl]cite news |title=Studios 301 |year=2008 |accessdate=26 October 2012[/tpl][/ref]
In 1954, the studios relocated from their original site in Homebush, to 301 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, and 
underwent a name change from Columbia Graphophone Studios to EMI Studios. Stereo Recording was introduced to the studios 
in 1958. The first artist to be recorded in stereo was the Don Burrows All Star Band. In 1969, the studios made the transition to 
8 track recording, using a 3M 1" machine, and four years later EMI installed the "Abbey Road" Console, which was a 
16 track 2" machine. Transition to 24 track recording was made in 1975.
A total refit and redesign of the studios was carried out in 1978, and the name was changed to Studios 301.name=Studios301>[tpl]cite news |title=Studios301 |year=2008 |accessdate=26 October 2012[/tpl][/ref] The studios were 
now able to make fully digital recordings (the first for Kerrie Biddell and her band in 1979).[tpl]cite news |title=Studios 301 |year=2008 |accessdate=26 October 2012[/tpl]
1996-1998 saw Studios 301 changing hands after EMI sold them in a management team buyout. The School of Audio 
Engineering (SAE) group of companies, headed by Tom Misner, acquired Studios 301, as well as Soundtrade Studios in 
Stockholm, Sweden. Misner directed the move of the recording facilities to their current location in Alexandria in 1999. 
The mastering facilities following in 2006. Navitas bought out the SAE Group in 2011, however Misner retains ownership of 
Studios 301.
