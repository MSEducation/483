==Early life==

Serena Williams was born in Saginaw, Michigan, to Richard Williams and Oracene Price and is the youngest of Price's five daughters: half-sisters Yetunde, Lyndrea and Isha Price, and full sister Venus. When the children were young, the family moved to Compton, California, where Serena started playing tennis at the age of four.[tpl]cite web|url=http://serenawilliams.com/about/|title=About Serena – Serena Williams|publisher=serenawilliams.com|accessdate=June 14, 2013[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Morgan|2001|page=19[/tpl] Her father home-schooled Serena and her sister Venus[tpl]Harv|Morgan|2001|page=28[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://sharebradenton.homestead.com/Famous.html |title = Successful & Famous People that were Homeschooled|accessdate=April 22, 2009|publisher=sharebradenton.homestead.com[/tpl] and to this day, Serena Williams was and remains coached by both her parents.
Williams' family moved from Compton to West Palm Beach when she was nine so that she could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci, who would provide additional coaching. Macci spotted the exceptional talents of the sisters. He did not always agree with Williams' father, but respected that "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls".[tpl]cite web | url = http://blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Tennis_35/Venus_Serena_Reflect_As_They_Prepare_For_Fed_Cup_3202.shtml|title = Venus, Serena reflect as they prepare for Fed Cup| publisher=blackathlete.net | accessdate =April 22, 2009|first=Michelle |last=Kaufman |date = April 22, 2007[/tpl] Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, since he wanted them to take it slow and focus on school work. Another factor was racial, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/122703/page/1|title=Venus And Serena Against The World|first=Marc|last=Peyser|first2= Allison|last2= Samuels| date=August 24, 1998|work=Newsweek |accessdate=April 19, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked No. 1 among under-10 players in Florida.Edmonson, 2005, Venus and Serena Williams, p. 46–47. In 1995, when Serena was in the ninth grade, Richard pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy, and from then on took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether having followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit would have been beneficial, Williams responded: "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us." In 2003 sister Yetunde was fatally shot in an SUV after a confrontation with youths in Compton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-196135/Williams-sister-dies-shooting.html |title=Williams' sister dies in shooting | last1 = Yapp | first1 = Robin | last2 = Witheridge | first2 = Annette | work = Mail Online | publisher = Associated Publishers Ltd. | date = September 2003 |accessdate=May 30, 2013[/tpl]

==Playing style==

Williams is primarily a baseline player and her game is built around taking immediate control of rallies with her powerful and consistent serve,[tpl]cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/aus08/news/story?id=3207822 |title=Gimpy Jankovic swats away defending champion Williams|publisher=ESPN | last= Ford|first= Bonnie D.|date=January 22, 2008|accessdate=April 29, 2009[/tpl] return of serve, and forceful groundstrokes from both her forehand and backhand swings. Williams' forehand is considered to be among the most powerful shots in the women's game as is her double-handed backhand. Williams strikes her backhand groundstroke using an open stance, and uses the same open stance for her forehand. Williams's aggressive play, a "high risk" style, is balanced in part by her serve, which combines great power and placement with very high consistency. Her serve is considered to be the greatest in the women tennis history. In the 2013 Australian Open, she had a peak serve speed of [tpl]convert|128.6|mph|kph|abbr=on[/tpl] which was the second-fastest all-time among female players (Venus recorded the fastest with 129  mph).[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/1978722/title/ids-serve-speed-leaders | title = IDS Serve Speed Leaders   | work = WTA Tennis.com | publisher = WTA Tour | date = June 10, 2013[/tpl] At the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, Serena hit a women's tournament record of 102 aces which was more than any of the men hit during the two weeks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tennisnow.com/News/Reigning-Ace--Williams-Serves-up-a-Title-at-Wimble.aspx |title=Reigning Ace: Williams Serves up a Title at Wimbledon |publisher=Tennis Now |author=Chris Oddo |date=July 7, 2012 |accessdate=June 16, 2013[/tpl] Serena also possesses a very solid volley and powerful overhead which is very useful for her net game. Although many think of Williams as only an offensive player, she also plays a strong defensive game.[tpl]cite journal |last= Wertheim |first= L.

==Professional career==

===1995–98: Professional debut===

Williams' first professional event was in September 1995, at the age of 14 to counteract the forthcoming changes to age-eligibility rules, at the Bell Challenge. She lost in the first round of qualifying to Anne Miller, winning just two games.[tpl]Harv|Williams|2009|pp=114–115[/tpl]
Williams did not play a tournament in 1996. The following year, she lost in the qualifying rounds of three tournaments, before winning her first main-draw match in November at the Ameritech Cup Chicago. Ranked world No. 304, she upset world No. 7 Mary Pierce and world No. 4 Monica Seles, recording her first career wins over top 10 players and becoming the lowest-ranked player in the open era to defeat two top 10 opponents in one tournament. She ultimately lost in the semifinals to world no. 5 Lindsay Davenport. She finished 1997 ranked world no. 99.
Williams began 1998 at the Medibank International Sydney. As a qualifier ranked world no. 96, she defeated world no. 3 Davenport in the quarterfinals, before losing to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the semifinals. Williams made her debut in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament at the Australian Open, where she defeated sixth-seeded Irina Spîrlea in the first round, before losing to sister Venus in the second round in the sisters' first professional match.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.wtatennis.com/2/players/playerprofiles/playerheadtoheaddetail.asp?PlayerID=230234&Player1ID=230220 | title = Head to Head – Serena Williams vs Venus Williams | publisher=WTA Tour, Inc. | accessdate=April 22, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080529021807/http://www.wtatennis.com/2/players/playerprofiles/playerheadtoheaddetail.asp?PlayerID=230234&Player1ID=230220 |archivedate = May 29, 2008[/tpl] Williams reached six other quarterfinals during the year, but lost all of them, including her first match against world no. 1 Martina Hingis at the Lipton International Players Championships in Key Biscayne, and her second match against Venus at the Italian Open in Rome. She failed to reach the quarterfinals of any Grand Slam tournament the remainder of the year, losing in the fourth round of the French Open to Sánchez Vicario, and the third round of both Wimbledon and the US Open, to Virginia Ruano Pascual and Spîrlea, respectively. She did, however, win the mixed doubles titles at Wimbledon and the US Open with Max Mirnyi, completing the Williams family's sweep of the 1998 mixed doubles Grand Slam tournaments. Williams won her first professional title in doubles in Oklahoma City with Venus, becoming the third pair of sisters to win a WTA title. The Williams sisters won two more doubles titles together during the year. Serena finished the year ranked world no. 20 in singles.

===1999–2001: Becoming a top-10 player===

Williams lost in the third round of the 1999 Australian Open to Sandrine Testud. Williams won her first professional singles title, when she defeated Amélie Mauresmo in the final of the Open Gaz de France. With Venus also winning the IGA Superthrift Classic that day, the pair became the first sisters to win professional tournaments in the same week.[tpl]cite news | title = Continents Apart, Williams Sisters Make History |url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902EFDC133CF932A35750C0A96F958260|work=The New York Times | accessdate =April 22, 2009 | date = March 1, 1999 | first = Sal A.|last= Zanca[/tpl] A month later, Serena won her first Tier I singles title at the Evert Cup, defeating Steffi Graf in the final. At the Lipton International Players Championships, Williams had her 16-match winning streak ended by Venus in the first all-sister singles final in WTA history, Serena made her top-10 debut at world no. 9. She then lost in the quarterfinals of the Italian Open and the German Open, and the third round of the French Open, where she and Venus won the women's doubles title. She then missed Wimbledon because of injury. When she returned to the tour, Williams won a Fed Cup singles match, won the JPMorgan Chase Open, beating Julie Halard-Decugis in the final, and reached the US Open final where she defeated Hingis to become the second African-American woman after Althea Gibson in 1958 to win a Grand Slam singles tournament. The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at this tournament. To complete 1999, Williams won a doubles match in the Fed Cup final against Russia. Williams ended the year ranked world no. 4 in just her second full year on the main tour.

Williams missed the French Open because of injury. She returned at Wimbledon, where she lost to Venus in the semifinals, but they won the doubles title at the event. Williams successfully defended her title in Los Angeles, defeating Davenport in the final. She reached the final of the Du Maurier Open where an injury forced her to retire from her match with Hingis. Her defense of the US Open title ended when she lost in the quarterfinals to Davenport. Williams teamed with Venus to win the gold medal in doubles at the Sydney Olympics in September. She ended the year winning the Toyota Princess Cup. She finished the year ranked world number 6.
Williams began 2001 losing to Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals of both Sydney and the Australian Open. Serena and Venus won the doubles title at the latter tournament, becoming only the fifth doubles team in history to win all four Grand Slam women's doubles titles during their career, completing a "Career Grand Slam". Her next event was the Pacific Life Open, defeating Kim Clijsters in the final. However the final was marred by the behavior of the crowd towards Williams and her family. The crowd were incensed at the perceived match fixing of games involving the family after Venus withdrew before their semifinal. Neither Williams sister has entered the tournament since. The following week at the Ericsson Open, Williams lost to Jennifer Capriati in the quarterfinals. She then lost in the quarterfinals to Capriati at the French Open and Wimbledon. This was the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament at which Williams had exited in the quarterfinals. At the North American hard-court season, she lost in the quarterfinals of Los Angeles, then captured her second title of the year at the Rogers Cup, defeating Capriati in the final. Williams reached the final of the US Open, losing to sister Venus. That was the first Grand Slam final contested by two sisters during the open era. At the 2001-ending Sanex Championships, Williams won the championship by walkover when Davenport withdrew before the start of the final because of a knee injury. Williams finished 2001 at world no. 6 for the second straight year.

===2002–03: "Serena Slam"===

Injury forced Williams to retire from her semifinal match at the Medibank International Sydney and to withdraw from the 2002 Australian Open. She won her first title of the year at the State Farm Women's Tennis Classic, defeating world no. 2 Jennifer Capriati in the final. She then won the Ericsson Open for the first time, becoming one of three players in the open era to defeat the world's top 3 at one tournament, after beating world no. 3 Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals, world no. 2 Venus in the semifinals, and world no. 1 Capriati in the final. Her 6–2, 6–2 win over Venus was her second career win over her sister. Williams played three clay-court tournaments before the 2002 French Open. Her first tournament was at Charleston, where she was the third seed. Serena reached the quarterfinals losing to Patty Schnyder. She reached her first clay-court final in May, at the Eurocard German Open losing to Justine Henin in a third set tiebreak. Williams went on to win her first clay court title at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, defeating Capriati in the semifinals and Henin in the final.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2002/may/20/tennis1 | title = Hingis may be out to end of year |work=The Guardian |location=UK  | accessdate =April 23, 2009 | date = May 20, 2002 | first = Eleanor|last= Preston [/tpl] This raised her ranking to a new high of world no. 3. Williams was the third seed at the French Open, where she claimed her first French Open title by defeating defending champion Capriati in the semifinals, and then defeating Venus in the final to win her Second Grand Slam title. Serena rose to a career high of no. 2 after the win, second only to older sister Venus. At the 2002 Wimbledon Championships, Williams won the title for the first time, defeating Venus to win a Grand Slam singles title without dropping a set for the first time in her career. This victory earned Williams the world no. 1 ranking, dethroning her sister and becoming only the third African-American woman to hold that ranking. The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at the tournament, the fifth Grand Slam doubles title for the pair. Williams played just one tournament between Wimbledon and the US Open, losing in the quarterfinals of the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles to Chanda Rubin, ending a 21-match winning streak. As the top-seeded player at the US Open, Williams reached the final where once again she defeated her sister to win the title for the second time. Williams won two consecutive singles titles in the fall, defeating Kim Clijsters to win the Toyota Princess Cup in Tokyo, and Anastasia Myskina to win the Sparkassen Cup in Leipzig, Germany. She reached the final at the year-end Home Depot Championships, where she lost to fifth-seeded Clijsters in straight sets, ending her 18-match winning streak. Williams finished 2002 with a 56–5 record, eight singles titles, and the world no. 1 ranking. She was the first African-American (male or female) to end a year with that ranking since Althea Gibson in 1958. She was the first woman to win three Grand Slam titles in one year since Hingis in 1997.
At the 2003 Australian Open, Williams went on to reach the semifinals for the first time, where she recovered from 5–1 down in the third set and saved two match points, before defeating Clijsters. She faced her sister Venus for the fourth consecutive Grand Slam final and won to become the sixth woman in the open era to complete a Career Grand Slam, joining Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, and Margaret Court. She also became the fifth woman to hold all Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously, joining Maureen Connolly Brinker, Court, Graf, and Navratilova. This feat was dubbed the Serena Slam by the press.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.tennischannel.com/news/NewsDetails.aspx?newsid=5055 | title =Grand Slam for Serena Williams? |first=John| last=Leicester|agency=Associated Press | publisher=Tennis Channel | accessdate =April 22, 2009| date = February 11, 2009[/tpl] The Williams sisters won their sixth Grand Slam doubles title together at this event.

Williams' winning streak came to an end when she lost the final of the Family Circle Cup to Henin, her first loss of the year after 21 wins. She also lost to Mauresmo in the semifinals of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome. Despite these losses, Williams was the top seed at the French Open, where she lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Henin, marking Williams's first loss in a Grand Slam tournament since 2001. The match was controversial, as Williams questioned Henin's sportsmanship, and spectators applauded Williams's errors. She was known to be dating professional football player LaVar Arrington at the time.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] Williams rebounded from the loss at the 2003 Wimbledon Championships, defeating Henin in the semifinals and Venus in the final.

The win made Williams a six-time champion in Miami breaking the record she held with Steffi Graf and became only the fourth woman in the open era to have won a tournament at least six times.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/3126967/title/serena-conquers-sharapova-miami| title = Serena Conquers Sharapova & Miami| date = March 30, 2013| work = WTA Tennis| publisher = WTA Tour[/tpl] Williams successfully defended her Charleston title winning it for the third time overall.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/3136277/title/serena-wins-49th-wta-title-in-charleston| title = Serena Wins 49th WTA Title In Charleston| date = April 7, 2013| work = WTA Tennis| publisher = WTA Tour[/tpl] Williams won her fiftieth career singles title in Madrid, defeating Sharapova in the final.

===2014–present: 20th year since turning pro===

Now considered one of the best female players of all time, Williams extended her winning streak to 22 matches by successfully defending her title at the 2014 Brisbane International. In the semifinals, Williams defeated world no. 4 Maria Sharapova for the fourteenth consecutive time and, for the title, world no. 2 Victoria Azarenka in straight sets. Serena's 2014 Australian Open campaign was, once again, hampered by an injury. Williams ended up losing to Ana Ivanovic in the fourth round, later revealing that she had considered withdrawing from the tournament even before the start of her third round match versus Daniela Hantuchová due to a back injury. Williams next competed at the 2014 Dubai Tennis Championships, where she lost her semifinal match against Alizé Cornet in straight sets. This loss marked the first time since the 2012 Western & Southern Open that Williams had failed making at least the final at a non-Slam event, as well as being the first time that she had lost a match in straight sets since then.
Following the conclusion of the 2014 BNP Paribas Open (Indian Wells), Williams has spent a total of 179 weeks atop the WTA rankings, passing her childhood idol Monica Seles who now sits at number 6 on the all-time list with 178 weeks. As the defending champion, Williams returned to the tennis courts at the 2014 Sony Open Tennis. Williams successfully defended her title with a win over China's Li Na in two sets to pass Andre Agassi for the most titles won at the event with seven.

==On-court activities==

===Competition with Venus Williams===

Serena Williams has played older sister Venus in 24 professional matches since 1998. Overall Serena is 14–10 against her sister. Serena has played Venus 12 times in Grand Slam singles tournaments and 11 times in other tournaments (including 11 finals). They have met in eight Grand Slam finals, with Serena winning six times. Beginning with the 2002 French Open, they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam singles finals, which was the first time in the open era that the same two players had contested four consecutive Grand Slam finals.

===Controversies===

====2004 US Open====

In her 2004 U.S. Open quarterfinal match against Jennifer Capriati, an overrule was made by chair umpire Mariana Alves in Capriati's favor, even though later video review showed this to be an error (as Williams' shot was well-inside the court).  This was one of several calls that incorrectly went against Williams throughout the match.  Williams attempted to argue the call, but was not successful. Capriati won the match, but tournament officials dismissed the umpire from the tournament. The controversy renewed calls for the adoption of technology like the MacCam and Hawk-Eye systems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5933547 |title=Officials apologize to Serena for bad call – U.S. Open, Aug. 30-Sept. 12- NBC Sports |publisher=MSNBC |date= September 9, 2004 |accessdate=January 27, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]

====2009 US Open====

In 2009, Williams again was involved in a controversial U.S. Open match, this time against Kim Clijsters in the semifinal round. The drama began at the end of the first set, when Williams slammed her racquet on the court in frustration over losing the set. She was given a warning, with a potential second violation carrying a one-point penalty. While trailing 4–6, 5–6, 15–30, Williams's second serve was called a foot fault, resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams gestured with her racquet to the lineswoman who had made the call and yelled at her, with profanities and an injury threat.[tpl]cite news| title= Serena Williams is fined $10,500 for US Open line judge tirade |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date= September 14, 2009 | url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/sep/13/serena-williams-tirade-us-open | accessdate=June 5, 2010 | first=Lawrence | last=Donegan[/tpl] During the subsequent on-court conference between the head judge, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, "I didn't say I would kill you. Are you serious?" Audio later confirmed she did threaten the linesman.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/usopen09/news/story?id=4468762 |title=Clijsters wins after controversial ending |date=September 13, 2009 |publisher=ESPN news services |accessdate=November 11, 2010[/tpl] The incident resulted in Williams being penalized a point for unsportsmanlike conduct — necessitated by the earlier warning for racquet abuse — meaning Clijsters won the match 6–4, 7–5. The following day, Williams was issued the maximum permissible on-site fine of $10,000 (plus $500 for racquet abuse). After further investigation, the Grand Slam Committee in November 2009 fined her $175,000 in lieu of suspending her from the 2010 US Open or other Grand Slam events.[tpl]cite news|title= Serena Williams Given Hefty Fine but No Suspension for Tirade |work=The New York Times |date= November 30, 2009 |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/sports/tennis/01serena.html?hp |accessdate=November 30, 2009 | first=Christopher | last=Clarey[/tpl] They also placed her on a two-year probation, so if Williams committed another offense in the following two years at a Grand Slam tournament, she would be suspended from participating in the following US Open. If she committed no offenses in the next two years, her fine would be reduced to $82,500. Williams initially refused to apologize for her outburst, both in her post-match press conference[tpl]cite news|title= Serena Williams tries to move on from uproar over outburst |date= September 15, 2009|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/09/15/serena.williams.outburst/index.html |accessdate=September 15, 2009 |publisher=CNN[/tpl] and in an official statement released the following day.Pucin, Diane. Serena Williams is fined $10,500 for tirade at U.S. Open Los Angeles Times (September 13, 2009) She eventually apologized to the lineswoman in a statement two days following the incident.

====2011 US Open====

In the final of the 2011 U.S. Open against Samantha Stosur, Williams again generated controversy. After shouting "Come on!" as the Australian attempted to return a forehand Williams believed to be a winner, chair umpire Eva Asderaki awarded the point to Stosur based on the USTA's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tennis4you.com/links/rules/rules.htm#R21|agency=Tennis 4 You|title=RULE 21 : Player Hinders Opponent[/tpl] As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur.  Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next several changeovers, warning her, "Don't look at me you honky," and telling her that if Asderaki ever saw Williams coming toward her, she should "look the other way". She told the umpire that she was "a white loser", and "unattractive on da inside". Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 6–2, 6–3. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/11/serena-williams-upset-samantha-stosur-us-open-final_n_957662.html|date=September 11, 2011|accessdate=September 11, 2011|title=Serena Williams Upset By Samantha Stosur 6–2, 6–3 In US Open Final|work=Huffington Post[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/blog/busted_racquet/post/serena-williams-blows-up-again-in-u-s-open-loss?urn=ten,wp3253|title=She did it again: Serena Williams blows up in U.S. Open loss|first=Chris|last=Chase|date=September 11, 2011|work=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=September 11, 2011[/tpl] Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, claiming, "I hit a winner, but I guess it didn't count", but added, "It wouldn't have mattered in the end.
