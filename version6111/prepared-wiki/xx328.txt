==Ethnicity==

===Ethnic origin===

Canadians were able to self-identify one or more ethnic origins in the 2006 census. Percentages therefore add up to more than 100%. The most common response was 'Canadian'. As data is completely self-reported, and reporting individuals may have varying definitions of "Ethnic origin" (or may not know their ethnic origin), these figures should not be considered an exact record of the relative prevalence of different ethnocultural ancestries but rather how Canadians self-identify.
Statistics Canada projects that, by 2031, approximately 28% of the population will be foreign-born. The number of people belonging to visible minority groups will double,
and make up the majority of the population in Toronto and Vancouver.
Single responses: 18.40% of respondents gave a single response of 'Canadian', while a further 13.82% identified with both 'Canadian', and one or more other ancestries. 4.38% of respondents gave a single response of English, 3.94% gave a single response of French, 3.63% gave a single response of Chinese, 2.50% gave a single response of East Indian, 2.37% gave a single response of Italian, 2.15% gave a single response of German, 1.82% gave a single response of Scottish, 1.64% gave a single response of North American Indian, 1.57% gave a single response of Irish, 1.41% gave a single response of Welsh and 1.03% gave a single response of Filipino; following are those that have given a single answer of Jamaican, North American Indian, Ukrainian, Greek, and Jewish.
Multiple responses: Counting both single and multiple responses, the most commonly identified ethnic origins were (2006):
Data from the same subject matter, though from 2001, is also grouped more geographically by Statistics Canada as follows:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/pages/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=PR&Code=01&Data=Count&Table=2&StartRec=1&Sort=3&Display=All&CSDFilter=5000 |title=Ethnocultural Portrait of Canada Highlight Tables, 2006 Census |publisher=2.statcan.ca |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2011-01-01[/tpl]
''Percentages are calculated as a proportion of the total number of respondents (31,241,030 in 2006) and total more than 100% due to dual responses. 
All ethnocultural ancestries with responses totalling to more than 1% of the total number of responses are listed in the table above according to the exact terminology used by Statistics Canada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&PID=62911&APATH=3&METH=1&PTYPE=55440&THEME=44&FOCUS=0&AID=0&PLACENAME=0&PROVINCE=0&SEARCH=0&GC=99&GK=NA&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&FL=0&RL=0&FREE=0&GID=431515 |title=Ethnic Origin (232), Sex (3) and Single and Multiple Responses (3) (2001 Census) |publisher=2.statcan.ca |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2011-01-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=PR&Code=01&Table=2&Data=Count&StartRec=1&Sort=3&Display=All |title=Ethnocultural Portrait of Canada – Data table |publisher=2.statcan.ca |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2011-01-01[/tpl]

The most common homogeneous ethnic groups per province, as shown by single responses (e.g. "Italian" only is a single response, whereas "Italian & Irish" is a multiple response and is subsumed under "multiple ethnic origin" in this grouping) are as follows (only percentages 3% or higher shown; ordered by percentage of "Canadian"):

===Aboriginal population===

===Visible minority population===

Statistics Canada identifies visible minorities as non-Aboriginal people who self-identify as being members of a specific minority. The "not a visible minority" category includes people who are Aboriginal, people of European descent, and people who may be of non-European, non-Aboriginal descent, but who do not consider themselves members of a "visible minority".
