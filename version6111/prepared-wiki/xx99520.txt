The fjord is also an excellent place for waterskiing and wakeboarding, but also for more quiet activities.

==History==

Sagesund got its name from a sash saw mill, located in a creek. The lumbermill was used by local farmers. In the 19th century there were three shipyards here, building sailing ships, brigs, barques, schooners, etc. There used to be a large ice storage building.  It was used to hold ice that was to be exported. In the 1950s, there were three stores, a post office, a galvanic workshop, an assembly house, and an electric sawmill.
The sailboat Origo started and ended its circumnavigation of the world from Sagesund in 1994. Nor Siglar, with half the crew from Sagesund, also included Sagesund as a natural stop on its way around the globe.
