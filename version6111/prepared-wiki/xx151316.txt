CATEGORIES: Football clubs in Puerto Rico

Club de Fútbol Fraigcomar is a Puerto Rican association football club, that mainly hosts an intramural tournament, in which occasionally the best players in each age group are chosen to compete abroad and against other Puerto Rican clubs.
The organization was founded in 1985 when a group of parents decided to improve a park in San Ignacio de Río Piedras to teach football to children. After some time that park became one of the most notable in the country. In 1990 Fraigcomar finally converted into a football club and started showing their potential in the youth squads, especially in under 10. During the nineties Fraigcomar became a Puerto Rican powerhouse in the youth divisions, thanks to the coaching of Antonio Pirillo, which later became the club's president. During Pirillo's coaching years, he had the first teams to win former youth powerhouses; Quintana and Don Bosco.
In 1993 the club started to play in senior level and a few years later with their women's team. In 2005 the team finally established as the best football team in Puerto Rico, winning the senior championship in three successive years from 2005–07 while also winning five of the seven youth categories.
Now the Club is the largest in Puerto Rico with more than 800 football players and more than 10 men's and women's football teams.
