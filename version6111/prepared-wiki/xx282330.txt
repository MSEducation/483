The 1945 Outer Banks hurricane was a moderate hurricane that struck Florida and affected the East Coast of the United States in late June, 1945. The first tropical storm and the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, it developed on June 20 in the western Caribbean Sea off Honduras. For the next two days, it moved generally northward into the Gulf of Mexico. Reaching hurricane intensity on June 23, it then turned northeast toward the Florida peninsula. It made landfall in the Big Bend on June 24, then weakened to a tropical storm over land. Minor damage was reported in Florida, but the storm produced heavy, though beneficial, rains that eased one of the state's worst recorded droughts. Upon entering the Atlantic Ocean, it re-intensified into a hurricane and paralleled the East Coast. On June 26, it struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina as a minimal hurricane, producing minor damage but heavy rainfall.
Continuing northeast, the cyclone delivered gale-force winds to New York and southern New England, causing traffic accidents and minor wind damage. Heavy rains drenched the area, and high waves offshore caused ships to need rescue. One man died in a traffic accident; some people were rescued on Long Island Sound. Peak winds on land were [tpl]convert|66|mi/h|km/h|lk=on[/tpl] at Nantucket, forcing ships to remain in port. The U.S. Coast Guard sought to escort ships at sea into safe harbor. Overall, the impact of the storm was minor, though temperatures fell almost 20°F the day after the storm.

==Meteorological history==

On June 19, a tropical disturbance was detected between Swan Island and the Honduran coast. However, surface data in the vicinity did not indicate a closed circulation until 12 UTC on June 20.[tpl]cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|author2=Hurricane Research Division|author3=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|title=Atlantic hurricane best track (HURDAT) Meta Data, 1945|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Oceanic & Atmospheric Research|date=June 2013|accessdate=2013-08-10|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/metadata_1945.html#1945_1[/tpl] At 14 UTC that day, an Air Force reconnaissance plane located near 24°N 84°W reported gale-force winds of [tpl]convert|35|kn|m/s|lk=on[/tpl] ([tpl]convert|40|mi/h|km/h|lk=on[/tpl]). At the time, this was taken to indicate that a tropical storm had formed about [tpl]convert|100|mi|km|sigfig=2|lk=on[/tpl] northwest of Swan Island.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sumner|first=H.

Little strengthening occurred over the next two days, until after 12 UTC on June 22. At that time, a period of rapid deepening commenced: within 24 hours, the cyclone increased its winds from [tpl]convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|80|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. At the same time, its track made a sharp bend toward the northeast, threatening the Florida peninsula. While no central pressure was recorded, Hurricane Hunter aircraft flew into the storm on June 23 and reported winds of [tpl]convert|115|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] at 2015 UTC. As with most early reconnaissance data, such readings are suspect; however, based upon the reconnaissance measurement, the storm was originally listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as a Category 3 hurricane. Later, reanalysis lowered this estimate to [tpl]convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], equal to Category 2 on the modern Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, due primarily to the absence of corroboration. After peaking late on June 23, the storm quickly lost intensity.
The hurricane continued northeast and made landfall at 08 UTC on June 24, north of the Tampa Bay Area.[tpl]U.S. hurricanes[/tpl] Although observations were sparse near the eye, the system was estimated to have had winds of [tpl]convert|80|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], though only minor impacts were reported as few people lived in the landfall area. After making landfall, the center tracked inland between Brooksville and Dunnellon, near the Hernando–Citrus county line.[tpl]cite journal|title=Severe Local Storms, June 1945|journal=Monthly Weather Review|date=June 1945|volume=73|pages=109–110|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1945)0732.0.CO;2|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/073/mwr-073-06-0109.pdf|accessdate=10 August 2013|publisher=National Weather Service[tpl]![/tpl]United States Weather Bureau[/tpl] About an hour before 18 UTC, the cyclone returned to water off the Atlantic coast of Florida, passing between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach. Due to interaction with land, maximum sustained winds by then had decreased to [tpl]convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].
After moving offshore, however, the cyclone quickly regained force. Within seven hours, it re-intensified into a minimal hurricane and paralleled the Southeastern United States, following the warm Gulf Stream. Early on June 26, the northeast-moving hurricane approached the North Carolina coast, and made a second landfall at 01 UTC near Beaufort, North Carolina. Passing very near to Cape Hatteras, the eye of the storm moved offshore at Oregon Inlet, near Wanchese. The storm maintained hurricane intensity as it moved over and northeast of the Outer Banks. At 06 UTC on June 27, the cyclone finally lost tropical characteristics, but still retained winds of hurricane force for another 12 hours. Continuing to the northeast, the extratropical low passed south of Nova Scotia and hit Miquelon, Miquelon-Langlade, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, with winds of [tpl]convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. The system survived another four days, only to lose its identity near Iceland at 12 UTC on July 4.

==Preparations and impact==

As early as June 19, the U.S. Weather Bureau began sending reconnaissance missions to monitor the developing storm in the Caribbean. The regular reports sent by the airplanes provided valuable data about the intensity of the small cyclone.[tpl]cite news|title=Hurricane Due to Hit Above Tampa Today|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0ysyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w-cFAAAAIBAJ&dq=gulf&pg=5953%2C1742965|accessdate=10 August 2013|newspaper=The Miami News|date=June 24, 1945|location=Miami, Florida[/tpl]  At 16 UTC (10:00 a.m. local time) on June 23, the U.S. Weather Bureau in New Orleans advised residents from Mobile, Alabama, to Cedar Key, Florida, to prepare for gale-force winds. Areas from Tampa to Grand Isle, Louisiana, were placed under a storm warning. The center of the storm was expected to strike land early on June 24 between Mobile and Panama City, Florida.[tpl]cite news|title=Mild Storm Passes Northward in Gulf|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-doLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FlUDAAAAIBAJ&dq=gulf&pg=4232%2C6483503|accessdate=10 August 2013|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=June 23, 1945|location=St. Petersburg, Florida[/tpl]  As the storm intensified into a hurricane, forecasters shifted their predicted landfall point eastward; early on June 24 the Weather Bureau expected the storm to strike between Tampa and Cross City, Florida. Hurricane warnings were issued for the coastline between Tampa and Carrabelle, Florida; meanwhile, storm warnings were issued from Punta Gorda to Titusville. The city of Tallahassee prepared to receive evacuees, and evacuations were ordered for coastal communities in the Big Bend. The Florida Highway Patrol warned local residents to leave the area, and soldiers were transported out of Carrabelle.[tpl]cite news|title=Gale Roaring Upon Florida|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=16kWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IyMEAAAAIBAJ&dq=gulf&pg=5669%2C2713851|accessdate=10 August 2013|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=June 24, 1945|agency=The Associated Press|location=Milwaukee[/tpl] As the hurricane moved closer to the Big Bend, storm warnings were extended up the Eastern Seaboard to Savannah, Georgia. Between 300–400 military aircraft were flown out of Florida to Birmingham, Alabama. Once the storm left Florida, additional evacuations commenced between Georgetown, South Carolina, and Cape Hatteras,[tpl]cite news|title=Storm Sweeps Eastern Coast|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YSdiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OXYNAAAAIBAJ&dq=gulf&pg=6420%2C3150368|accessdate=10 August 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph-Herald|date=June 25, 1945|agency=The Associated Press|location=Dubuque, Iowa[/tpl] including the North Carolina communities of Wilmington, Morehead City, and nearby resort towns.[tpl]cite news|title=New York City Prepares for Strong Winds Today as Storm Sweeps North|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KL8wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wE4DAAAAIBAJ&dq=storm&pg=4601%2C1063828|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=June 26, 1945|agency=The Associated Press[/tpl] Large-scale evacuations from the Wilmington area alone involved 5,000 people and were credited with reducing loss of life. Meanwhile, storm warnings were extended northward to Norfolk, Virginia; however, only minor impacts occurred in Carolinas and Virginia.[tpl]cite news|title=Storm Is Moving Up Atlantic Coast|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wLxWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=x0ENAAAAIBAJ&dq=storm&pg=3152%2C4272011|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=St. Joseph News-Press|date=June 26, 1945|agency=The Associated Press|location=St. Joseph, Missouri[/tpl]  Nevertheless, the cyclone continued to parallel the East Coast, so storm warnings were eventually extended to Atlantic City, New Jersey; small watercraft in the Northeastern United States were advised to stay in port.
Winds in the Tampa Bay Area reached tropical storm force, [tpl]convert|39|–|46|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], at 05 UTC on June 24. At that time, the "center" of the storm was estimated to be [tpl]convert|25|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] across. Near the point of landfall, the hurricane defoliated citrus trees and downed power lines, and flash floods washed out roadways.[tpl]cite news|title=Hurricane Threatens Carolinas; Tides Mount, Storm Grows In Intensity|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1CsyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w-cFAAAAIBAJ&dq=gulf&pg=1732%2C2203720|accessdate=10 August 2013|newspaper=The Miami News|date=June 25, 1945|agency=The Associated Press[/tpl] Throughout its path, the hurricane generated prolific rains. Peak rainfall along the path totaled [tpl]convert|13.6|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] at Lake Alfred;[tpl]cite report|author=Schoner, Robert W|author2=Molansky, Sydney|author3=National Hurricane Research Project|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/1956NHRPreportNo3.pdf|title=Rainfall associated with Hurricanes and other Tropical Disturbances|accessdate=11 August 2013|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|year=1956|page=177[/tpl] West Palm Beach recorded [tpl]convert|11.4|in|mm|sigfig=3|lk=on[/tpl] of rain within a 24-hour period.[tpl]cite news|title=Tropical Storm Past Sarasota, Heavy Rainfall|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mNciAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oGQEAAAAIBAJ&dq=gulf&pg=6779%2C4972443|accessdate=10 August 2013|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=June 24, 1945|agency=The Associated Press|location=Sarasota, Florida[/tpl] Rainfall in Orange County exceeded [tpl]convert|6|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on[/tpl], which proved beneficial to dry orange groves; the heavy rains ended one of the worst droughts in Florida's history.  Overall, damage in the Miami area was described as being slight, totaling $75,000 (1945 USD). The hurricane also produced two tornadoes in Florida, one near LaBelle and another near Melbourne. Along the Georgia coast, the hurricane produced only fringe impacts, including strong winds and heavy rain. Wind gusts to [tpl]convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] were reported from Tybee Island, and portions of coastal North Carolina received up to [tpl]convert|8.24|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] of rain.[tpl]cite news|title=Heavy Tropic Storm Lashes Up U.S. Coast|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W34tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ApkFAAAAIBAJ&dq=storm&pg=4278%2C4334277|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=June 27, 1945|agency=The Associated Press|location=Montreal[/tpl]
In New York and New England, the outer bands of the hurricane produced gale-force winds and high surf;  peak winds were reported at up to [tpl]convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] on Long Island Sound, and large waves caused some boats to capsize and people to need rescue.[tpl]cite news|title=Darien Soldier Saved on Sound|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j1cpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=A24FAAAAIBAJ&dq=storm&pg=5382%2C4369380|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=The Norwalk Hour|date=June 27, 1945|location=Norwalk, Connecticut[/tpl] Offshore, even higher velocities were reported: a weather station on Nantucket, Massachusetts, measured a peak wind of [tpl]convert|66|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], and in the Atlantic Ocean winds reaching [tpl]convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] battered Coast Guard vessels. The Coast Guard nevertheless sought to escort troubled ships into port. Heavy rainfall fell across coastal New England, peaking at [tpl]convert|4.59|in|mm|sigfig=2|abbr=on[/tpl] on Nantucket. The heavy rains and gale-force winds hindered normal traffic; a vehicle struck and killed a man at Warwick, Rhode Island. At least 10,000 telephone lines were taken out of service, 7,000 of them in the Cape Cod region. Besides causing power outages, the stormy conditions damaged trees, buildings, and crops; in the Boston area, high winds knocked down trees and chimneys. A strong temperature gradient existed between the cyclone and the Northeast U.S.: in New York City, the daily high on June 26 was almost 20° F lower than on the preceding day.[tpl]cite news|title=Tropical Storm Skirts New York|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Kb8wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wE4DAAAAIBAJ&dq=storm&pg=3902%2C1150165|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=June 27, 1945|agency=The Associated Press[/tpl]
