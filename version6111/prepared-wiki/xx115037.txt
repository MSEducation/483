[[Maileus]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Maileus is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Its only species, M. fuscus, is only known from Sarawak and Sumatra. According to its original describers, it is closely related to the genus Microhasarius.
M. fuscus is known only from a single female, which is about 6Â mm long. Although no published drawings exist, Zabka has drawn the genitalia, and Proszynski has drawn the genitalia of both sexes of what is probably a different species of Maileus.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 272 No study has been published on the genus since its first description.Platnick 2007
