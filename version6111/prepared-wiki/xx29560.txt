Graphology is the study of handwriting.[tpl]cite book | url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/80845 | title=graphology | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2013 | accessdate=31 Dec 2013[/tpl] As a theory or practice for inferring a person's character, disposition, and attitudes from their handwriting, graphology is generally considered pseudoscience.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/safarchive/3_ask/archive/qna/3282_bbeyerstein.html |title=Barry Beyerstein Q&A |accessdate=2008-02-22 |work=Ask the Scientists |publisher=Scientific American Frontiers [/tpl] "they simply interpret the way we form these various features on the page in much the same way ancient oracles interpreted the entrails of oxen or smoke in the air. I.e., it's a kind of magical divination or fortune telling where 'like begets like.'"[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/03/news/03iht-grapho.html?pagewanted=1|title=Graphology Is Serious Business in France : You Are What You Write?|last=James|first=Barry|date=3 August 1993|work=New York Times|accessdate=18 September 2010[/tpl] The term is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to forensic document examination.
Graphology has been controversial for more than a century. Although supporters point to the anecdotal evidence  of positive testimonials as a reason to use it for personality evaluation, most empirical studies fail to show the validity claimed by its supporters.[ref]

==Etymology==

From grapho- (from the Greek γραφή, "writing") and logos (from the Greek λόγος, "word"). There also exist many other words formed from the same root: Graphopathology, Graphomaniac, Graphistic, Graphopsychology, Psychographology, Graphometric, Graphometry, Graphoanalysis, Graphotechnology, Micrographia.

==Approaches==

There are three approaches to graphology: the integrative approach, the holistic approach, and the symbolic

===Systems of handwriting analysis===

Each approach to handwriting analysis has spawned several different systems.

===Training===

Four academic institutions around the world currently offer an accredited degree in handwriting analysis:

====Training in the United States====

Between 1940 and 1995, New School for Social Research, in New York City, offered a diploma in Graphology. At its peak, the diploma course took 8 semesters, and also included Forensic Document Analysis. This diploma did not have academic accreditation.
From 1970 to 2000, one could obtain a Graphology track Associate Arts Degree from Felician College, in Lodi, NJ. This was the only academic institution in the United States to have offered graphology for an accredited academic degree.
Training in the United States is currently available through correspondence courses. The quality of instructions varies considerably.

====Writing systems====

The majority of material in the field is oriented towards the Latin Writing system. Courses offered in the subject reflect that bias.

==Vocabulary==

Every system of handwriting analysis has its own vocabulary. Even though two or more systems may share the same words, the meanings of those words may be different. The technical meaning of a word used by a handwriting analyst, and the common meaning is not congruent. Resentment, for example, in common usage, means to feel or exhibit annoyance. In Graphoanalysis, the term indicates a fear of imposition.[ref]

==Validity==

Although graphology had some support in the scientific community before the mid-twentieth century, the results of most recent surveys on the ability for graphology to assess personality and job performance have been negative.Nevo, B Scientific Aspects Of Graphology: A Handbook Springfield, IL: Thomas: 1986 Graphology is primarily used as a recruiting tool to screen candidates during the evaluation process. Many studies have been conducted to assess its effectiveness to predict personality and job performance. Recent studies testing the validity of using handwriting for predicting personality traits and job performance have been consistently negative.
In a 1987 study, graphologists were unable to predict scores on the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire using writing samples from the same people. In a 1988 study, graphologists were unable to predict scores on the Myers-Briggs test using writing samples from the same people. A 1982 meta-analysis drawn from over 200 studies concludes that graphologists were generally unable to predict any kind of personality trait on any personality test.
Measures of job performance appear similarly unrelated to the handwriting metrics of graphologists. Professional graphologists using handwriting analysis were just as ineffective as lay people at predicting performance in a 1989 study. A broad literature screen done by King and Koehler confirmed dozens of studies showing the mechanical aspects of graphology (slant, slope, etc.) are essentially worthless predictors of job performance.
Rowan Bayne, a British psychologist who has written several studies on graphology, summarized his view of the appeal of graphology: "It's very seductive because at a very crude level someone who is neat and well behaved tends to have neat handwriting", adding that the practice is "useless... absolutely hopeless".[ref]
