The film has a 'Fresh' 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and an average score of 8.9/10 based on the reviews of 47 critics, with the general consensus being "Terrence Malick's debut is a masterful slice of American cinema, rife with the visual poetry and measured performances that would characterize his work."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1001577-badlands/ |title=Badlands |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2013-01-09[/tpl]
Martin Sheen stated to a newspaper in 1999 that Badlands "still is" the best script he had ever read. He wrote that "It was mesmerising. It disarmed you. It was a period piece, and yet of all time. It was extremely American, it caught the spirit of the people, of the culture, in a way that was immediately identifiable."
