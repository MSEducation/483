Dumbleyung is a town and shire in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, [tpl]convert|267|km|mi|0[/tpl] south-east of Perth between Wagin and Lake Grace on State Route 107.

==History==

Dumbleyung's name is of Aboriginal origin, coming from "Dambeling" which possibly means "large lake or inland sea" (although another source suggests it came from "dumbung", a game played with bent sticks and a hard piece of fruit). The lake nearby was discovered and named Dambeling Lake by explorers Henry Landor and Henry Maxwell Lefroy in 1843, and the current spelling was used by surveyors in the 1860s and 1870s.[tpl]LandInfo WA|c|D|2007-04-17[/tpl] Pastoralists and sandalwood cutters moved into the area, initially settling at Nippering, north of Lake Dumbleyung and [tpl]convert|10|km|mi|0[/tpl] west of the present town. 
The first three families to settle in the area were the Cronin, Kersley and Bartram families. George Kersley, Sr. and his future son-in-law Henry Bartram were from pioneer families of the Beverley district and they used to take their sheep flocks from Beverley to Lake Dumbleyung for grazing. In 1875 Kersley received the first grazing leases and the Cronin family from Cork Ireland settled at "Bunkin" in 1878. Bartram settled his young family at "Wheatfield" on the edge of the Lake in 1886.
However, in 1907, Dumbleyung was gazetted as a townsite and became the terminus of a railway from Wagin. 
Tenders were called for the construction of an Agricultural Hall in 1909,[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26226113|title=Country|newspaper=The West Australian|location=Perth, Western Australia|date=22 April 1909|accessdate=1 October 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl] and it was completed by 1910. The National Bank temporarily opened its town branch in the hall.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26250535|title=Country |newspaper=The West Australian |location=Perth, Western Australia |date=28 February 1910 |accessdate=1 October 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
By 1915, Dumbleyung had grown to become the major rural service town in the region.

==Present day==

The nearby Dumbleyung Lake is a well-known attraction. The lake is famous for Donald Campbell breaking the world water speed record there in 1964 in his boat, Bluebird.
Dumbleyung itself is a service centre with a post office, school, tavern, public library, caravan park and other facilities. Both the tavern and roadhouse offer counter meals. Each year in November the town hosts the Bluebird Festival, attracting visitors to the town.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wagin.yourguide.com.au/detail.asp?class=news&subclass=local&story_id=437931&category=General%20News&m=11&y=2005|title=Bluebird weekend an outstanding success|author=The Wagin Argus|date=10 November 2005|accessdate=2006-10-28[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/greatsouthern/stories/s1236750.htm|title=Dumbleyung bluebird festival|author=ABC Great Southern|date=9 November 2004|accessdate=2006-10-28[/tpl]
