[[Electoral division of Katherine]]

CATEGORIES: Electoral divisions of the Northern Territory

Katherine is an electoral division of the Legislative Assembly in Australia's Northern Territory. The electorate was first created in 1987 and derives its name from the Katherine River. Katherine encompasses both urban and rural areas, covering an area of 7,428 kmÂ² and taking in the city of Katherine, as well as the Tindal RAAF Base and the Binjari Aboriginal Community. There were 5,184 people enrolled in the electorate as of August 2012. 
The city of Katherine has always been a conservative bastion, making the seat of the same name traditionally a very safe Country Liberal Party seat.  Its first member, Mike Reed, was Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory from 1995 to 2001.  Despite this, the seat saw a very large swing to the Australian Labor Party at the 2001 election.   Reed retired in 2003 and was succeeded by Fay Miller, also of the CLP.  Miller narrowly held onto her seat in the ALP's massive victory of 2005, weathering another large swing to the ALP that surprised commentators on election night.  In the end, however, Miller proved to be in the least danger of all the sitting CLP members.She retired in 2008 and was replaced by Willem Westra van Holthe, also of the CLP.
