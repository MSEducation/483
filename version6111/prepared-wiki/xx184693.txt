[[Zootrophion]]

CATEGORIES: Epidendroideae genera, Pleurothallidinae

Zootrophion is a genus of about 12 species of orchid, distributed from Jamaica and Central America through the Andes. The stems have inflated, flattened sheaths. The flowers bear sepals that fuse at their tips to form box-like structures that resemble animal's heads, hence the generic name, which means "menagerie".
