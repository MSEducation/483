Youth team coach Micky Cook expressed uncertainty over whether to sign Cousins but asked for him to attend pre-season for assessment. Putting in an impressive performance featuring in a friendly for Barnet, Cook promptly signed Cousins on a scholarship.[tpl]cite book|last1=Whitehead|first1=Jeff|last2=Drury|first2=Kevin|title=The Who's Who of Colchester United: The Layer Road Years|year=2008|publisher=Breedon Books|location=Derby|isbn=978-1-85983-629-3|page=60[/tpl]

Cousins had to wait until the beginning of the 2007–08 season to get his first taste of first-team action with Colchester. He was brought on as a substitute for striker Kevin Lisbie after goalkeeper Dean Gerken was sent off for bringing down Kayode Odejayi in the penalty area during Colchester's 2–2 draw with Barnsley on 18 August 2007. His first task was to save the ensuing penalty, but Brian Howard slotted the penalty away. He conceded another goal later in the game, once again scored by Howard from the penalty spot.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/6941741.stm | title=Colchester 2–2 Barnsley | publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 August 2007 |accessdate=30 April 2014 [/tpl] He made just one further appearance in the 2007–08 season, replacing the injured Gerken late on in a 1–1 away draw with Bristol City on 12 January 2008.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7172798.stm | title=Bristol City 1–1 Colchester | publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 January 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=Games played by Mark Cousins in 2007/2008 | url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=39799&season_id=137 | publisher=Soccerbase | accessdate = 30 April 2014[/tpl]

Following some impressive performances, Cousins was rewarded with a new two-year contract in May 2009.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/colchester_united/8074530.stm | title=Vincent to stay with Colchester | publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=30 April 2014 [/tpl]

On 27 May 2011, Cousins agreed a new two-year deal with the club, competing with Ben Williams and Carl Pentney for the 2011–12 season.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13575019 | title=Keeper Mark Cousins extends Colchester United deal | publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=30 April 2014 [/tpl] During the 2011–12 pre-season, a friendly match between local rivals Colchester United and Ipswich Town as abandoned when U's midfielder Andrew Bond suffered a serious head injury in a collision with Cousins, leaving Bond with concussion.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14305935 | title=John Ward backs Colchester United-Ipswich abandonment | publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 July 2011 |accessdate=30 April 2014 [/tpl] Having started Colchester's first nine league games of the season, Cousins spent much of it as a back-up keeper who travelled to games but never made the substitutes bench. However, following Ben Williams' rejection of a new contract in July 2012 and his subsequent exit, Cousins was given the number 1 shirt ahead of the 2012–13 season.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/colchester-united/mark_cousins_likes_the_sound_of_the_no_1_1_1434013 | title=Mark Cousins likes the sound of the No.1 |newspaper=East Anglian Daily Times |location=East Anglia |last=Marston |first=Carl |date=5 July 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2014 [/tpl]
After eight years around the first team waiting for the opportunity, Cousins was first-choice keeper at Colchester United. He made his first appearance in the number 1 shirt on 14 August 2012 as Colchester fell to a 3–0 League Cup defeat to Yeovil Town.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19159735 | title=Yeovil 3–0 Colchester | publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2014 [/tpl] After making 26 appearances for Colchester and with the club struggling at the lower end of League One, Cousins was gradually pushed out of the first-team picture, firstly by John Sullivan in November 2012, signed on loan from Charlton Athletic, and then by Sam Walker in January 2013, signed on loan from Chelsea. However, he was offered a fresh contract in May 2013,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/sport/colchesterunited/10399592._/? | title=Duo offered new deals as Heath departs U's |newspaper=Daily Gazette |location=Colchester |last=Waldron |first=Jonathan |date=3 May 2013 |accessdate=30 April 2014 [/tpl] He signed on a one-year deal with the option of a further year on 14 June.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/sport/colchesterunited/10486928._/? | title=Cousins signs new contract with U's |newspaper=Daily Gazette |location=Colchester |last=Waldron |first=Jonathan |date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=30 April 2014 [/tpl]
For the 2013–14 season, Colchester re-signed Sam Walker on loan from Chelsea on 19 July 2013 having been influential in helping the U's avoid relegation to League Two.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23381172 | title=Chelsea goalkeeper Sam Walker rejoins Colchester United | publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=30 April 2014 [/tpl] Following the expiry of Walker's loan, Colchester signed him on a permanent basis on 20 January 2014, further keeping Cousins out of first-team action.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25810083 | title=Transfer window: Colchester United sign Chelsea's Sam Walker | publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 January 2014 |accessdate=30 April 2014 [/tpl]
