==Football career==

Born in Estivella, Valencian Community, Juanra played his first five professional seasons with local Levante UD. He never managed however, to appear for the club in La Liga, alternating between the main and the second squads, the latter of which competed in the lower leagues.
For the 2006–07 campaign Juanra moved to CD Numancia in the second division, going on to establish himself as first-choice during a three-year spell. On 25 June 2009, after the club's relegation from the top level, the 29-year-old signed for Hércules CF, another side from the Valencia region, playing in 38 games in his debut season as the team returned to the top flight after 13 years.
