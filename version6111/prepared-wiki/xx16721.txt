The Sermon on the Mount (anglicized from the Matthean Vulgate Latin section title: Sermo in monte) is a collection of sayings and teachings of Jesus, which emphasizes his moral teaching found in the Gospel of Matthew (chapters 5, 6 and 7)."Sermon on the Mount." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of The Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 It is the first of the Five Discourses of Matthew and takes place relatively early in the Ministry of Jesus after he has been baptized by John the Baptist and preached in Galilee. 
The Sermon is the longest piece of teaching from Jesus in the New Testament, and has been one of the most widely quoted elements of the Canonical Gospels.
It includes some of the best known teachings of Jesus, such as the Beatitudes, and the widely recited Lord's Prayer. To most believers in Jesus, the Sermon on the Mount contains the central tenets of Christian discipleship.
The last verse of chapter 5 is considered to be a focal point that summarizes the teaching of the sermon: "be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect", advising his disciples and followers to seek the path towards perfection and the Kingdom of God.

==Background and setting==

The Sermon on the Mount is the longest piece of teaching from Jesus in the New Testament, and occupies chapters 5, 6 and 7 of the Gospel of Matthew. The Sermon has been one of the most widely quoted elements of the Canonical Gospels.The Sermon on the mount: a theological investigation by Carl G. Vaught 2001 ISBN 978-0-918954-76-3 pages xi–xiv To most believers in Jesus, the Sermon contains the central tenets of Christian discipleship.
This is the first of the Five Discourses of Matthew, the other four being Matthew 10, Matthew 13 (1–53), Matthew 18 and the Olivet discourse in Matthew 24.The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 ISBN 978-0-8054-4365-3 pages 194–196The Gospel of Matthew by Craig S. Keener 2009 ISBN 978-0-8028-6498-7 pages 37–38Preaching Matthew's Gospel by Richard A. Jensen 1998 ISBN 978-0-7880-1221-1 pages 25 & 158
The Sermon takes place relatively early in the Ministry of Jesus, after he has been baptized by John the Baptist in chapter 3 of Matthew and gathered his first disciples in chapter 4.
Before this episode, Jesus had been "all about Galilee" preaching, as in Matthew 4:23, and "great crowds followed him" from all around the area. The setting for the sermon is given in Matthew 5:1-2. Jesus sees the multitudes, goes up into the mountain, is followed by his disciples, and begins to preach.

==Components==

While the issue of the exact theological structure and composition of the Sermon on the Mount is subject to debate among scholars, specific components within it, each associated with particular teachings, can be identified.
[tpl]bibleref2|Matthew|5:3-12|9|Matthew 5:3–12[/tpl] discusses the Beatitudes. These describe the character of the people of the Kingdom of God, expressed as "blessings". The Greek word most versions of the Gospel render as "blessed," can also be translated "happy". (See [tpl]bibleref2|Matthew|5:3-12|YLT|Matthew 5:3–12[/tpl] of Young's Literal Translation for an example.) In Matthew, there are eight (or nine) blessings, while in Luke there are four, followed by four woes. "Beatitudes." Frank Leslie Cross, Elizabeth A. Livingstone, editors The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 ISBN 9780192802903
In almost all cases the phrases used in the Beatitudes are familiar from an Old Testament context, but in the sermon Jesus elevates them to new teachings. Together, the Beatitudes present a new set of ideals that focus on love and humility rather than force and exaction; they echo the highest ideals of Jesus' teachings on spirituality and compassion.A Dictionary Of The Bible by James Hastings 2004 ISBN 1-4102-1730-2 page 15-19
In Christian teachings, the Works of Mercy, which have corporal and spiritual components, have resonated with the theme of the Beatitude for mercy.Jesus the Peacemaker by Carol Frances Jegen 1986 ISBN 0-934134-36-7 pages 68–71 These teachings emphasize that these acts of mercy provide both temporal and spiritual benefits.The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke by Ján Majerník, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt 2005 ISBN 1-931018-31-6, pages 63–68
[tpl]bibleref2|Matthew|5:13-16|9|Matthew 5:13–16[/tpl] presents the metaphors of Salt and Light. This completes the profile of God's people presented in the beatitudes, and acts as the introduction to the next section.
There are two parts in this section, using the terms "salt of the earth" and Light of the World to refer to the disciples[tpl]snd[/tpl] implying their value. Elsewhere, in [tpl]bibleref|John|8:12|9[/tpl], Jesus applies Light of the World to himself.[tpl]cite book |first=Charles |last=Spear |title=Names and Titles of the Lord Jesus Christ |year=2003 |isbn=0-7661-7467-0 |page=226[/tpl]
Jesus preaches about hell and what hell is like:
"But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire." Matthew 5:22 KJV http://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=hell+fire&qs_version=KJV
The longest discourse in the Sermon is [tpl]bibleref2|Matthew|5:17-48|9|Matthew 5:17–48[/tpl], traditionally referred to as the Antitheses or Matthew's Antitheses though Gundry disputes that title.[tpl]cite book |title=Commentary on Matthew |first=Robert H. |last=Gundry |publisher=Baker Academic |year=2011 |chapter=The righteousness which surpasses that of the scholars and pharisees |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=SDt4uW-hxCUC&pg=PT54 |page=54 |isbn=978-1-4412-3758-3[/tpl] In the discourse Jesus fulfills and reinterprets the Old Covenant and in particular its Ten Commandments, contrasting with what "you have heard" from others, e.g. turning the other cheek compared to taking an eye for an eye. According to most interpretations of Matthew 5:17, 18, 19, and 20, and most Christian views of the Old Covenant, these new interpretations of the Law and Prophets are not opposed to the Old Testament, which was the position of Marcion, but form Jesus' new teachings which bring about salvation, and hence must be adhered to, as emphasized in [tpl]bibleref2|Matthew|7:24-27|9|Matthew 7:24–27[/tpl] towards the end of the sermon.[tpl]cite book |title=The Gospel of Matthew |first=R. T. |last=France |year=2007 |isbn=080282501X |pages=1118–9[/tpl]
In Matthew 6 Jesus condemns doing what would normally be "good works" simply for recognition and not from the heart, such as those of alms (6:1–4), prayer (6:5–15), and fasting (6:16–18). The discourse goes on to condemn the superficiality of materialism and call the disciples not to worry about material needs, but to "seek" God's kingdom first. Within the discourse on ostentation, Matthew presents an example of correct prayer. Luke places this in a different context. The Lord's prayer (6:9–13) contains parallels to [tpl]bibleverse|1|Chronicles|29:10–18[/tpl].Clontz, T.E. and J., "The Comprehensive New Testament with complete textual variant mapping and references for the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Nag Hammadi Library, Pseudepigrapha, Apocrypha, Plato, Egyptian Book of the Dead, Talmud, Old Testament, Patristic Writings, Dhammapada, Tacitus, Epic of Gilgamesh", Cornerstone Publications, 2008, p. 451, ISBN 978-0-9778737-1-5Stevenson (2004), p. 198.
The first part of Matthew 7, i.e. [tpl]bibleref2|Matthew|7:1-6|9|Matthew 7:1–6[/tpl] deals with judging. Jesus condemns those who judge others before first judging themselves: "Judge not, that ye be not judged."
In the last part in [tpl]bibleref2|Matthew|7:7-29|9|Matthew 7:7–29[/tpl] Jesus concludes the sermon by warning against false prophets, and emphasizing that humans are unable to do right ("bear fruit") apart from God.

==Teachings and theology==

The teachings of the Sermon on the Mount have been a key element of Christian ethics, and for centuries the sermon has acted as a fundamental recipe for the conduct of the followers of Jesus.The sources of Christian ethics by Servais Pinckaers 1995 ISBN 0-8132-0818-1 page 134 Various religious and moral thinkers (e.g. Tolstoy and Gandhi) have admired its message, and it has been one of the main sources of Christian pacifism.For Tolstoy, see My Religion, 1885. cf. My Religion on Wikisource.
In the 5th century, Saint Augustine began his book Our Lord's Sermon on the Mount by stating:
The last verse of chapter 5 of Matthew ([tpl]bibleverse-nb||Matthew|5:48|9[/tpl]) is a focal point of the sermon that summarizes its teachings by advising the disciples to seek perfection."[tpl]cite book |last=Vaught |first=Carl G. |authorlink= |title=The Sermon on the Mount: A Theological Interpretation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XB3nwV7JxqkC&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q=father%20is%20perfect&f=false |accessdate= |year=1986 |publisher=SUNY Press |location= |isbn=9781438422800 |page=7–10[/tpl] The Greek word telios used to refer to perfection also implies an end, or destination, advising the disciples to seek the path towards perfection and the Kingdom of God. It teaches that God's children are those who act like God.[tpl]cite book |last=Talbert |first=Charles H. |authorlink= |chapter=Matthew |title=Paideia: Commentaries on the New Testament |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tbmoR2j0-sgC&pg=PA78#v=onepage&q=act%20like%20God&f=false |accessdate= |year=2010 |publisher=Baker Academic |location= |isbn=9780801031922 |page=78[/tpl]
The teachings of the sermon are often referred to as the Ethics of the Kingdom: they place a high level of emphasis on "purity of the heart" and embody the basic standard of Christian righteousness.Christian ethics, issues and insights by Eṃ Stephan 2007 ISBN 81-8069-363-5 page

===Theological structure===

The issue of the theological structure and composition of the Sermon on the Mount remains unresolved.Reading the Sermon on the mount: by Charles H. Talbert 2004 ISBN 1-57003-553-9 pages 21–26What are they saying about Matthew's Sermon on the mount? by Warren Carter 1994 ISBN 0-8091-3473-X pages 35–47[tpl]cite journal |title=The Structure of the Sermon on the Mount (PDF) |first1=Dale C. |last1=Allison |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |volume=106 |issue=3 |date=September 1987 |pages=423–45 |jstor=3261066 |url=http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/jbl/1987_allison.pdf[/tpl] One group of theologians ranging from Saint Augustine in the 5th century to Michael Goulder in the 20th century, see the Beatitudes as the central element of the Sermon. Others such as Bornkamm see the Sermon arranged around the Lord's prayer, while Daniel Patte, closely followed by Ulrich Luz, see a chiastic structure in the sermon. Dale Allison and Glen Stassen have proposed a structure based on triads.Stassen, Glen H. "The Fourteen Triads of the Sermon on the Mount." Journal of Biblical Literature, 2003. Jack Kingsbury and Hans Dieter Betz see the sermon as composed of theological themes, e.g. righteousness or way of life.

==Analysis and interpretation==

===Interpretations===

The Sermon has been interpreted in a wide variety of ways by different Christian groups and Craig S. Keener states that at least 36 different interpretations regarding the message of the Sermon exist.[tpl]cite book |title=The Gospel of Matthew |first=Craig S. |last=Keener |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8028-6498-7 |pages=160–2 |chapter=The sermon's message |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=8C2Y_HaL5W0C&pg=PA160[/tpl] Keener lists 8 categories of views:

===Comparison with the Sermon on the Plain===

While Matthew groups Jesus' teachings into sets of similar material, the same material is scattered when found in Luke. The Sermon on the Mount may be compared with the similar but more succinct Sermon on the Plain as recounted by the Gospel of Luke (6:17–49), which occurs at the same moment in Luke's narrative, and also features Jesus heading up a mountain, but giving the sermon on the way down at a level spot. Some scholars believe that they are the same sermon, while others hold that Jesus frequently preached similar themes in different places.Ehrman 2004, p. 101

===Comparison with Buddhist teachings===

Although modern parallels between the teachings of Jesus such as the Sermon on the Mount and some Buddhist teachings have been drawn, these comparisons emerged after missionary contacts in the 19th century, and there is no historically reliable evidence of contacts between Buddhism and Jesus during his life.Jesus: The Complete Guide 2006 by Leslie Houlden ISBN 082648011X page 140 Modern scholarship has almost unanimously agreed that claims of the travels of Jesus to Tibet, Kashmir or India (see Unknown years of Jesus) and the influence of Buddhism on his teachings are without historical basis.Van Voorst, Robert E (2000).
