==Biography and writing life==

Siri Hustvedt attended public school in her hometown Northfield, Minnesota and received a degree from the Cathedral School in Bergen, Norway, in 1973.  Hustvedt graduated from St. Olaf College with a B.A. in History in 1977. She moved to New York City to attend Columbia University as a graduate student in 1978. Her first published work was a poem in The Paris Review.“Weather Markings,” The Paris Review 81 (1981): 136-137.
A small collection of poems, Reading to You,Reading to You (Barrytown, NY: Station Hill Press, 1982). appeared in 1982 with Station Hill Press. 
She met her husband, the writer Paul Auster in 1981, and they were married the following year. 
She completed her PhD in English at Columbia in 1986. Her dissertation on Charles Dickens, Figures of Dust: A Reading of Our Mutual Friend, is an exploration of language and identity in the novel, with particular emphasis on Dickens’ metaphors of fragmentation, his use of pronouns, and their relation to a narrative, dialogical conception of self.Figures of Dust: A Reading of Our Mutual Friend (Ann Arbor: University Microfilms, 1986). She refers in the dissertation to sources that would influence and reappear in her later writing, including the work of Søren Kierkegaard, Emile Benveniste, Roman Jakobson, Mikhail Bakhtin, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Mary Douglas, Paul Ricoeur, and Julia Kristeva. 
Hustvedt and Auster’s daughter, Sophie Hustvedt Auster, the singer and actress, was born in 1987.
After finishing her dissertation, Hustvedt began writing prose. Two stories of the four that would become her first novel, The Blindfold, were published in literary magazines“Mr. Morning,” Ontario Review 30 (1989): 80–98; “Houdini,” Fiction 9 (1990): 144–62. and later included in Best American Short Stories 1990 and 1991.“Mr. Morning,” in The Best American Short Stories 1990, ed. Richard Ford (New York: Houghton Mifflin. 1990), 105–26; “Houdini,” in Best American Short Stories 1991, ed. Alice Adams (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1991), 209–27. Since then she has continued to write fiction and publish essays on visual art but also on diverse interdisciplinary subjects that investigate the intersections among philosophy, psychoanalysis, and neuroscience.

==Writing style and themes==

Siri Hustvedt’s works repeatedly pose questions about the nature of identity, selfhood and perception. In The Shaking Woman or A History of My Nerves, an interdisciplinary account of her own seizure disorder, Hustvedt states her need to view her symptom not “through a single window” but “from all angles.”The Shaking Woman or A History of My Nerves (New York: Henry Holt, 2009), 73. These multiple perspectives do not resolve themselves into a single view but rather create an atmosphere of ambiguity and flux. Hustvedt presents the reader with characters whose minds are inseparable from their bodies and their environments and whose sense of self is situated on the threshold between the conscious and unconscious. Her characters often suffer traumatic events that disrupt the rhythms of their lives and lead to disorientation and a discontinuity of their identities. Hustvedt’s concern with embodied identity manifests itself in her investigation of gender roles and interpersonal relations. Both her fiction and nonfiction highlight dynamics of the gaze and questions of ethical representation in the visual arts. 
An example of crossover to her husband's work, Auster used Iris, the narrator of Hustvedt's first novel, The Blindfold, in his novel Leviathan.The Paris Review Interviews, ed. Philip Gourevitch, vol. 4 (New York: Picador, 2009), 324.
