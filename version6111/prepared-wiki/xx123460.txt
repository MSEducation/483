City Square Shopping Centre is a mall across the street from City Hall in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is located in the heart of the heritage district of central Vancouver, on the northwest corner of 12th Avenue and Cambie Street.
City Square Shopping Mall and office complex was inaugurated in 1989 and is an example of adaptive reuse of heritage buildings. With its outdoor tree-lined courtyard and blend of shops and services, City Square Mall has the ambiance of a European village mixed with the bustle of West Coast urban life.

==History==

Unique to Vancouver, City Square's shopping mall and office complex is a mix of modern and heritage architecture. The heritage portions of the complex were built in 1905 and 1908 to house the Model School and Normal School, respectively. Graduates from the Teacher’s Training Program applied their skills, norms (hence the name “Normal School”) and educational theories at the Normal School to gain practical experience. In 1986 the City of Vancouver designated both school buildings as municipal heritage sites, saving them from demolition.Provincial Normal School, Vancouver Island University.

The schools were restored to their original grandeur and then connected to two six-storey office towers by a modern glass atrium.
