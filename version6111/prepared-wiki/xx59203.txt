==Location, campus, and community==

CSU's main campus in downtown Cleveland is bounded on the east and west by Interstate 90 and East 17th Street, respectively; and by Payne Avenue to the north and Carnegie Avenue on the south. It also has a satellite campus in Westlake, Ohio which is located in the Greater Cleveland metropolitan area in Cuyahoga County. As of spring 2013, the combined student body (undergraduate and graduate students) totaled over 17,000.

===Campus Expansion===

In 2006, Cleveland State University completed its state-of-the-art student Recreation Center, and a renovation of Parker Hannifan Hall for the College of Graduate Studies.
In 2009, CSU unveiled a long-term plan to make the campus more amenable to residence and increase the number of students living on campus by building thousands of housing units, anchored by a new dormitory, Fenn Tower, a reuse of the school's most historic building. Fenn Tower formerly housed what was at one time the longest Foucault pendulum in the world. However, because the pendulum had been inoperative since 1980 it was removed during the residence hall renovation in 2006. The pendulum is currently kept in the Cleveland State University archives.
The university worked with private developers and the City of Cleveland to develop housing, retail, and "collegetown" amenities around Fenn Tower, particularly along the main thoroughfare of Euclid Avenue. In 2010, Euclid Avenue was upgraded as part of the Euclid Corridor Project which brought bus rapid transit to the university and connected Public Square in downtown Cleveland to University Circle, approximately four miles to the east.city.http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/03/csu_officials_envision_large_e.html Cleveland State University's $65 million construction project, intended to transform the campus from a mostly commuter school into a residential campus,[tpl]cite web|author=David I.

There is no student television station at this time, though the university offers a film production and video production major with courses through its Digital Video Communication Center.

===Information technology===

CSU is a member of the OneCommunity (formerly OneCleveland) computer network, an initiative of Case Western Reserve University that connects nonprofit institutions throughout Northeast Ohio, allowing large scale collaborations over a high-speed fiber optic network.

==Athletics==

When the school was still known as Fenn College, the sports teams' nickname was the Foxes. When the University was renamed Cleveland State, the nickname changed as well, and CSU's sports teams became the "Vikings". That nickname stands to this day. The school colors are forest green and white.  For many years the school mascot was the comic strip character Hägar the Horrible along with his wife Helga, and the couple appeared at sporting events as well as on University literature. A new mascot, "Vike" was introduced in 1997 and Hagar was gradually phased out by 1998. Another new mascot named "Magnus" was introduced in August 2007.
Cleveland State fields varsity teams in seventeen sports.  Most of the teams compete in the Horizon League.  The men's basketball team was noteworthy in 1986 when seeded 14th in the NCAA tournament, it upset heavily favored 3-seed Indiana and St. Joseph's before being beaten by Navy by one point, an unprecedented achievement for such a low seed. The Vikes made yet another NCAA tournament appearance in 2009, upsetting the highly favored 4th seeded Wake Forest before falling to the University of Arizona in the second round.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,509997,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Cleveland State Shocks Wake Forest | date=March 21, 2009[/tpl] The school also fields a wrestling team that competes in the Eastern Wrestling League.
