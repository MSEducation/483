In mathematics, a cubic form is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3, and a cubic hypersurface is the zero set of a cubic form.
In [tpl]harv|Delone|Faddeev|1964[/tpl], Boris Delone and Dmitriĭ Faddeev showed that binary cubic forms with integer coefficients can be used to parametrize orders in cubic fields. Their work was generalized in [tpl]harv|Gan|Gross|Savin|2002|loc=§4[/tpl] to include all cubic rings,A cubic ring is a ring that is isomorphic to Z3 as a Z-module.In fact, Pierre Deligne pointed out that the correspondence works over an arbitrary scheme. giving a discriminant-preserving bijection between orbits of a GL(2, Z)-action on the space of integral binary cubic forms and cubic rings up to isomorphism.
