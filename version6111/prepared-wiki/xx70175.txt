Chloramines are derivatives of ammonia by substitution of one, two or three hydrogen atoms with chlorine atoms: monochloramine (chloroamine, NH2Cl), dichloramine (NHCl2), and nitrogen trichloride (NCl3).Clause 2.4 Chloramines ISO 7393-2 The term chloramine also refers to a family of organic compounds with the formulas R2NCl and RNCl2 (R is an organic group).
Monochloramine (chloroamine) is an inorganic compound with the formula NH2Cl.  It is an unstable colorless liquid at its melting point of −66 °C, but it is usually handled as a dilute aqueous solution, in which form it is sometimes used as a disinfectant.

==Synthesis and chemical reactions==

NH2Cl is a highly unstable compound in concentrated form. Pure NH2Cl decomposes violently above −40 °C.Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. ISBN 0-12-352651-5. Gaseous chloroamine at low pressures and low concentrations of chloroamine in aqueous solution are thermally slightly more stable. Chloroamine is readily soluble in water and ether, but less soluble in chloroform and carbon tetrachloride.[tpl]citation | author=Anton Hammerl | author2=Thomas M.

===Production===

In dilute aqueous solution, chloroamine is prepared by the reaction of ammonia with sodium hypochlorite:
This is also the first step of the Raschig hydrazine synthesis. The reaction has to be carried out in a slightly alkaline medium (pH 8.5 to 11). The acting chlorinating agent in this reaction is hypochloric acid (HOCl), which has to be generated by protonation of hypochlorite, and then reacts in a nucleophilic substitution of the hydroxo against the amino group. The reaction occurs quickest at around pH 8. At higher pH values the concentration of hypochloric acid is lower, at lower pH values ammonia is protonated to form ammonium ions NH4+, which do not react further.
The chloroamine solution can be concentrated by vacuum distillation and by passing the vapor through potassium carbonate which absorbs the water. Chloroamine can be extracted with ether.
Gaseous chloroamine can be obtained from the reaction of gaseous ammonia with chlorine gas (diluted with nitrogen gas):
Pure chloroamine can be prepared by passing fluoroamine through calcium chloride:

===Decomposition===

The covalent N-Cl bonds of chloroamines are readily hydrolyzed with release of hypochlorous acid:[tpl]citation | author=Yasukazu Ura | author2=Gozyo Sakata | contribution=Chloroamines | title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | page=5[/tpl]
The quantitative hydrolysis constant (K value) is used to express the bactericidal power of chloroamines, which depends on their generating hypochlorous acid in water. It is expressed by the equation below, and is generally in the range 10-4 – 10-10 (2.8 ✕ 10-10 for monochloroamine):
In aqueous solution, chloroamine slowly decomposes in a neutral or mildly alkaline (pH However, only a few percent of a 0.1 M chloroamine solution in water decompose according to the formula in several weeks. At pH values above 11, the following reaction slowly occurs:
In an acidic medium at pH values of around 4, chloroamine disproportionates to form dichloroamine, which in turn disproportionates at pH values below 3 to form nitrogen trichloride:
At low pH values, nitrogen trichloride dominates and between pH 3-5 dichloroamine dominates. These equilibria are disturbed by the irreversible decomposition of both compounds:

===Reactions===

In water chloroamine is pH neutral. It is an oxidizing agent (acidic solution: E° = -1.48 V, in basic solution E° = -0.81 V):
Reactions of chloroamine include radical, nucleophilic, and electrophilic substitution of chlorine, electrophilic substitution of hydrogen, and oxidative additions.
Chloroamine can, like HOCl, donate positively charged chlorine in reactions with nucleophiles:
Examples of chlorination reactions include transformations to dichloroamine and nitrogen trichloride in acidic medium, as described in the decomposition section.
Chloroamine may also aminate nucleophiles (electrophilic amination):
The amination of ammonia with chloroamine to form hydrazine is an example of this mechanism (Raschig process):
Chloramine electrophilically aminates itself in neutral and alkaline media to start its decomposition:
2 NH2Cl ⟶ N2H3Cl + HCl
The chlorohydrazine (N2H3Cl) formed during self-decomposition is unstable and decomposes itself, which leads to the net decomposition reaction:

==Uses and chemical reactions==

NH2Cl is a key intermediate in the traditional synthesis of hydrazine.
Monochloramine oxidizes sulfhydryls and disulfides in the same manner as HClO,Jacangelo, J. G., V. P. Olivieri, and K. Kawata. 1987. Oxidation of sulfhydryl groups by monochloramine. Water Res. 21:1339–1344. but only possesses 0.4% of the biocidal effect of HClO.Morris, J. C. 1966. Future of chlorination. J. Am. Water Works Assoc. 58:1475–1482.

==Uses in water treatment==

Chloramine is used as a disinfectant for water because it is less aggressive than chlorine and more stable against light than hypochlorites.

===Drinking water disinfection===

NH2Cl is commonly used in low concentrations as a secondary disinfectant in municipal water distribution systems as an alternative to chlorination.  This application is increasing.  Chlorine (referred to in water treatment as free chlorine) is being displaced by chloramine—to be specific monochloramine—which is much more stable and does not dissipate as rapidly as free chlorine.  NH2Cl also has a very much lower, however still present, tendency than free chlorine to convert organic materials into chlorocarbons such as chloroform and carbon tetrachloride.  Such compounds have been identified as carcinogens and in 1979 the United States Environmental Protection Agency began regulating their levels in U.S. drinking water.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Some of the unregulated byproducts may possibly pose greater health risks than the regulated chemicals.[tpl]cite journal|author=Stuart W.

Adding chloramine to the water supply may increase exposure to lead in drinking water, especially in areas with older housing; this exposure can result in increased lead levels in the bloodstream, which may pose a significant health risk.[tpl]cite journal |author=Marie Lynn Miranda, et al. |title=Changes in Blood Lead Levels Associated with Use of Chloramines in Water Treatment Systems |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |date=February 2007 |volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=221–5 |doi=10.1289/ehp.9432[/tpl]

===Swimming pool disinfection===

In swimming pools, chloramines are formed by the reaction of free chlorine with organic substances. Chloramines, compared to free chlorine, are both less effective as a sanitizer and, if not managed correctly, more irritating to the eyes of swimmers.  Chloramines are also responsible for the reported "chlorine" smell of swimming pools.[tpl]cite book |last=Donegan |first=Fran J. |title=Pools and Spas |year=2011 |publisher=Creative Homeowner |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |isbn=978-1-58011-533-9 |coauthors=David Short[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Controlling Chloramines in Indoor Swimming Pools |url=http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/factsheets/environmental/control_chloramines.html |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=2013-02-15[/tpl]  Pool test kits designed for use by homeowners are sensitive to both free chlorine and chloramines, which can be misleading.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]
There is also evidence that exposure to chloramine can contribute to respiratory problems, including asthma, among swimmers.[tpl]cite journal |author=Valérie Bougault, et al. |title=The Respiratory Health of Swimmers |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=295-312 |date=2009-01-01 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/adis/smd/2009/00000039/00000004/art00003 |doi=10.2165/00007256-200939040-00003[/tpl]  Respiratory problems related to chloramine exposure are common and prevalent among competitive swimmers.[tpl]cite journal|title=The determinants of prevalence of health complaints among young competitive swimmers |journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=32-9 |date=2006-10-01 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w3273wx6n3734p38/ |doi=10.1007/s00420-006-0100-0[/tpl]

==Removing chloramines from water==

Chloramines should be removed from water for dialysis, aquariums, hydroponic applications, and homebrewing beer. Chloramines can interfere with dialysis, can hurt aquatic animals, and can give homebrewed beer a medicinal taste by forming chlorophenols. In hydroponic applications, it will stunt the growth and fruit production of plants.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
When a chemical or biological process that changes the chemistry of chloramines is used, it falls under reductive dechlorination. Other techniques use physical—not chemical—methods for removing chloramines.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===Dialysis===

Chloramine must be removed from the water prior to use in kidney dialysis machines, as it would come in contact with the bloodstream across a permeable membrane. However, since chloramine is neutralized by the digestive process, kidney dialysis patients can still safely drink chloramine-treated water.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]

====Ultraviolet light====

The use of UV for chlorine or chloramine removal is an established technology that has been widely accepted in pharmaceutical, beverage, and dialysis applications.[tpl]cite web|last=Adelstein |first=Ben |url=http://www.watertechonline.com/bottled-water/article/considering-uv-technology-in-water-bottling |title=Considering UV technology in water bottling |publisher=Watertechonline.com |date=2010-10-13 |accessdate=2013-11-23[/tpl] Ultraviolet light is also used at aquatic facilities.

====Superchlorination====

Chloramine can be removed from tap water by treatment with superchlorination (10 ppm or more of free chlorine, such as from a dose of sodium hypochlorite bleach or pool sanitizer) while maintaining a pH of about 7 (such as from a dose of hydrochloric acid).  Hypochlorous acid from the free chlorine strips the ammonia from the chloramine, and the ammonia outgasses from the surface of the bulk water.  This process takes about 24 hours for normal tap water concentrations of a few ppm of chloramine.  Residual free chlorine can then be removed by exposure to bright sunlight for about 4 hours.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]

====Ascorbic acid====

Ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate completely neutralizes both chlorine and chloramines but degrades in a day or two, which make it usable only for short-term applications; SFPUC determined that 1000 mg of Vitamin C (tablets purchased in a grocery store, crushed and mixed in with the bath water) remove chloramine completely in a medium-size bathtub without significantly depressing pH.[tpl]cite web|title=Questions Regarding Chlorine and Chloramine Removal From Water (Updated June 2013) |publisher=San Francisco Public Utilities Commission |url=http://www.sfwater.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=4125 |accessdate=2013-11-23[/tpl]

====Activated carbon====

Activated carbon have been used for chloramine removal long before catalytic carbon became available; Standard activated carbon requires a very long contact time, which means a large volume of carbon is needed. For thorough removal, up to four times the contact time of catalytic carbon may be required.
Most dialysis units now depend on granular activated carbon (GAC) filters, two of which should be placed in series so that chloramine breakthrough can be detected after the first one, before the second one fails.[tpl]cite journal|author=Ward DM. |title=Chloramine removal from water used in hemodialysis |journal=Adv Ren Replace Ther. |date=Oct 1996 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=337-47 |pmid=8914698[/tpl] Additionally, sodium metabisulfite injection may be used during circumstances.Handbook of Dialysis, page 81

====Campden tablets====

Home brewers use reducing agents such as sodium metabisulfite or potassium metabisulfite (both proprietary sold as campden tablets) to remove chloramine from brewing fermented beverages. However, residual sodium can cause off flavors in beerBrewing, Michael Lewis so potassium metabisulfite is preferred.

====Sodium thiosulfate====

Sodium thiosulfate is used to dechlorinate tap water for aquariums or treat effluent from waste water treatments prior to release into rivers. The reduction reaction is analogous to the iodine reduction reaction. Treatment of tap water requires between 0.1 grams and 0.3 grams of pentahydrated (crystalline) sodium thiosulfate per 10 liters of water. Many animals are sensitive to chloramine, and it must be removed from water given to many animals in zoos.
Sodium thiosulfate has been used as treatment of calciphylaxis in hemodialysis patients with end-stage renal disease.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cicone JS, Petronis JB, Embert CD, Spector DA |title=Successful treatment of calciphylaxis with intravenous sodium thiosulfate |journal=Am. J. Kidney Dis. |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1104–8 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15168392 |doi=10.1053/j.ajkd.2004.03.018[/tpl]

====Other methods====

Chloramine, like chlorine, can be removed by boiling and aging. However, time required to remove chloramine is much longer than that of chlorine. The time required to remove half of the chloramine (half-life) from 10 gallons of water by boiling is 26.6 hours, whereas the half-life of free chlorine in boiling 10 gallons of water is only 1.8 hours.[tpl]cite web |url=http://hbd.org/ajdelange/Brewing_articles/BT_Chlorine.pdf |title=Experiments in Removing Chlorine and Chloramine From Brewing Water |format=PDF |date=1998-11-03 |accessdate=2013-11-23[/tpl]

==Organic chloramines==

A variety of organic chloramines are known and proven useful in organic synthesis. Examples include N-chloromorpholine (ClN(CH2CH2)2O), N-chloropiperidine, and N-chloroquinuclidinium chloride.Lindsay Smith, J. R.; McKeer, L. C.; Taylor, J. M. "4-Chlorination of Electron-Rich Benzenoid Compounds: 2,4-Dichloromethoxybenzene" Organic Syntheses, CollectedVolume 8, p.167 (1993)..http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV8P0167.pdf describes several N-chloramines

===Reduction of organic chloramines===

Chloramines are often an unwanted side-product of oxidation reactions of organic compounds (with amino groups) with bleach. The reduction of chloramines back into amines can be carried out through a mild hydride donor. Sodium borohydride will reduce chloramines, but this reaction is greatly sped up with acid catalysis.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Safety==

US EPA drinking water quality standards limit chloramine concentration for public water systems to 4 parts per million (ppm) based on a running annual average of all samples in the distribution system. In order to meet EPA-regulated limits on halogenated disinfection by-products, many utilities are switching from chlorination to chloramination. While chloramination produces fewer regulated total halogenated disinfection by-products, it can produce greater concentrations of unregulated iodinated disinfection by-products and N-nitrosodimethylamine.[tpl]cite journal |title=Occurrence of a New Generation of Disinfection Byproducts |year=2006 |last1=Krasner |first1= Stuart W. |last2=Weinberg |first2=Howard S. |last3=Richardson |first3=Susan D. |last4=Pastor |first4=Salvador J. |last5=Chinn |first5=Russell |last6=Sclimenti |first6=Michael J. |last7=Onstad |first7=Gretchen D. |last8=Thruston |first8=Alfred D. |journal= Environmental Science & Technology |volume=40 |issue=23 |pages=7175–85 |doi=10.1021/es060353j[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=Occurrence, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity of regulated and emerging disinfection by-products in drinking water: A review and roadmap for research |year=2007 |last1=Richardson |first1=Susan D. |last2=Plewa |first2=Michael J. |last3=Wagner |first3=Elizabeth D. |last4=Schoeny |first4=Rita |last5=DeMarini |first5=David M. |journal=Mutation Research/Reviews in Mutation Research |volume=636 |issue=1–3 |pages=178–242 |pmid=17980649 |doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2007.09.001[/tpl] Both iodinated disinfection by-products and N-nitrosodimethylamine have been shown to be genotoxic.
Chloroamine has been implicated as a mutagen and as a toxic agent for aquatic life, hence the US EPA proposes to prohibit its use in drinking water.
