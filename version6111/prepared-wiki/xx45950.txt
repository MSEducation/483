==Biography==

===Early life===

Tegmark was born in Sweden, son of Karin Tegmark and Harold S. Shapiro, studied at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, and later received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley. After having worked at the University of Pennsylvania, he is now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While still in high-school, Max wrote, and sold commercially, together with school buddy Magnus Bodin a word processor written in pure machine code [tpl]cite web|url=http://x42.com/teddy/ |title=buzzword free zone - home of magnus bodin |publisher=X42.com |accessdate=2012-11-01[/tpl] for the Swedish eight-bit computer ABC 80.

===Career===

His research has focused on cosmology, combining theoretical work with new measurements to place constraints on cosmological models and their free parameters, often in collaboration with experimentalists. 
He has over 200 publications, of which nine have been cited over 500 times.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-spires.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/wwwcitesummary?rawcmd=FIND+a+tegmark |title=Spires-Hep: Find A Tegmark |publisher=Spires.slac.stanford.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01[/tpl]
He has developed data analysis tools based on information theory and applied them to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments such as COBE, QMAP, and WMAP, and to galaxy redshift surveys such as the Las Campanas Redshift Survey, the 2dF Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
With Anthony Aguirre, he developed the Cosmological interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Tegmark has also formulated the "Ultimate ensemble theory of everything", whose only postulate is that "all structures that exist mathematically exist also physically". This simple theory, with no free parameters at all, suggests that in those structures complex enough to contain self-aware substructures (SASs), these SASs will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically "real" world. This idea is formalized as the "Mathematical universe hypothesis",[tpl]cite journal|last=Tegmark|first=Max|title=The Mathematical Universe|journal=Foundations of Physics|volume=38|issue=2|pages=101â€“150|doi=10.1007/s10701-007-9186-9|bibcode = 2008FoPh...38..101T |arxiv = 0704.0646 [/tpl] a short version of which is available at Shut up and calculate. (in reference to David Mermin's famous quote "shut up and calculate" http://physicstoday.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_57/iss_5/10_1.shtml described in his book Our Mathematical Universe.
Tegmark was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2012 for, according to the citation, "his contributions to cosmology, including precision measurements from cosmic microwave background and galaxy clustering data, tests of inflation and gravitation theories, and the development of a new technology for low-frequency radio interferometry".APS Archive (1990-present)

===Personal life===

He was married to astrophysicist Angelica de Oliveira-Costa in 1997, and divorced in 2009. They have two sons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/personal.html |title=Max Tegmark Homepage |publisher=Space.mit.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01[/tpl]  On August 5, 2012, Prof. Tegmark married Meia Chita.[tpl]cite web|url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/last_wedding.html |title=Welcome to Meia and Max's wedding |publisher=Space.mit.edu |accessdate=2014-01-10[/tpl]
