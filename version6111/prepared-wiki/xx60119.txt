He founded the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association and Oral Roberts University.
As one of the most well-known and controversial American religious leaders of the 20th century, Roberts preached a form of Christianity he called seed-faith.[tpl]cite book|author=Roberts, Oral|title=A Daily Guide to Miracles and Successful Living Through Seed-Faith|url=http://www.biblio.com/oral-roberts/a-daily-guide-to-miracles~36814857~title|isbn=978-0800783006|origyear=1975|year=1980|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|publisher=Fleming H.

==Early life==

Roberts was born in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma, the fifth and youngest child of the Reverend Ellis Melvin Roberts and Claudius Priscilla Roberts (née Irwin) (d. 1974).[tpl]cite news |title=Oral Roberts's Mother Dies |publisher=The New York Times|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60D10F93F58137B93CBA8178FD85F408785F9 |date=1974-04-19 |accessdate=2009-12-15[/tpl] According to an interview on Larry King Live, Irwin was of Cherokee descent.[tpl]cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0201/31/lkl.00.html|title=Interview With Lennox Lewis; Interview With Oral Roberts (transcript)|date=January 31, 2002|work=Larry King Live|accessdate=December 18, 2009[/tpl]  Roberts was a card-carrying member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.[tpl]cite web|title=Cherokee Community of Central California|url=http://centralca.cherokee.org/|accessdate=May 23, 2010[/tpl] Roberts began life in poverty and nearly died of tuberculosis at age 17.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tulsatoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1429:oral-roberts-dies&catid=58:local&Itemid=106 |title=Oral Roberts Dies |publisher=Tulsa Today|date=December 15, 2009|first=David |last=Arnett |accessdate=December 21, 2009[/tpl] After finishing high school, Roberts studied for two years each at Oklahoma Baptist University and Phillips University.
In 1938 he married a preacher's daughter, Evelyn Lutman Fahnestock.[tpl]cite web|title=Evelyn Lutman Roberts|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=10919187|publisher=Find A Grave[/tpl]
Roberts became a traveling faith healer after ending his college studies without a degree. According to a TIME Magazine profile of 1972, Roberts originally made a name for himself with a large mobile tent "that sat 3,000 on metal folding chairs" where "he shouted at petitioners who did not respond to his healing."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905738-1,00.html|title=Religion: Oral's Progress|publisher=Time|date=February 7, 1972|first=|last=|accessdate=2007-01-04[/tpl]

==Ministry and university==

1947 came as a turning point. Up until that time Roberts had struggled as a part-time preacher in Oklahoma. But at the age of 29 Roberts claims he picked up his Bible and it fell open at the Third Epistle of John where verse two read: "I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth." Roberts decided immediately that it was all right to be rich. The next day, he said, he bought a Buick and God appeared, he said, telling him to heal the sick.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/15/oral-roberts-obituary|title=Oral Roberts obituary|last=Christopher|first=Reed|publisher=The Guardian (UK)|date=December 15, 2009|accessdate=December 21, 2009 | location=London[/tpl]
Roberts resigned his pastoral ministry with the Pentecostal Holiness Church to found Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association (OREA). He conducted evangelistic and faith healing crusades across America and around the world, including claiming he could raise the dead."Oral Roberts Tells Conference He Has Raised People From the Dead," New York Times, Jun 27, 1987"I've Raised People from the Dead, Oral Roberts tells 5,000 in Tulsa," The Pittsburgh Press, Jun 26, 1987 Thousands of sick people would wait in line to stand before Oral Roberts so he could pray for them. He appeared as a guest speaker for hundreds of national and international meetings and conventions. Through the years, he conducted more than 300 crusades on six continents, and personally laid hands in prayer on more than 2 million people.[tpl]cite news|url=http://laist.com/2009/12/15/evangelist_dr_oral_roberts_dies_at.php|title=Evangelist Dr. Oral Roberts Dies at 91 in Newport Beach|last=Behrens|first=Zach|publisher=LAist|date=December 15, 2009|accessdate=December 19, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=ORAL ROBERTS DIES: Funeral Arrangements Pending for Legendary Evangelist|url=http://static.ktul.com/documents/oralroberts.pdf|publisher=KTUL-TV|date=Press release of December 15, 2009[/tpl] He also ran direct mail campaigns of seed-faith, which appealed to poor Americans, often from ethnic minorities. At its peak in the early 1980s, Roberts was the leader of a $120 million-a-year organization employing 2,300 people. This spanned not only a university but also a medical school and hospital as well as buildings on [tpl]convert|50|acre|m2[/tpl] south of Tulsa valued at $500 million. Another part of the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, the Abundant Life Prayer Group (ALPG), was founded in 1958.
In 1963, he founded Oral Roberts University (ORU) in Tulsa, Oklahoma, stating he was obeying a command from God. The university was chartered during 1963 and received its first students in 1965. Students were required to sign an honor code pledging not to drink, smoke, or engage in premarital sexual activities. The Prayer Tower, opened in 1967, is located at the center of the campus.
Roberts was a pioneer televangelist, and attracted a vast viewership. He began broadcasting by radio in 1947,[tpl]cite web|title=Broadcasters Vote Three to Hall of Fame|url=http://oabok.org/documents/HOF_info_for_website.pdf|publisher=Oklahoma Association of Broadcasters|year=2010|accessdate=June 4, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Chancellor Roberts Elected to Hall of Fame|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/oru_news/20091120_chancellor_roberts_elected.php|publisher=Oral Roberts University|date=November 20, 2009[/tpl] and began broadcasting his revivals by television in 1954. His television ministry continued with The Abundant Life program reaching 80% of the United States by 1957, and quarterly Prime Time Specials from 1969 through 1980. In 1996, he founded Golden Eagle Broadcasting.
On 17 March 1968, Roberts and his wife were received as members of the Boston Avenue United Methodist Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma by Dr. Finis Crutchfield, then pastor. The United Methodist Church offered more leniency in doctrinal and moral issues than the Pentecostalism. This granted Roberts some leeway, as it was expected that the strictness of the Pentecostal tradition may have impeded his rise in popularity.[tpl]cite book |title= Oral Roberts: An American Life |last= Harrell, Jr. |first= David Edwin |year= 1985 |publisher= Indiana University Press |location= Bloomington, Indiana |isbn= 0-253-15844-3 |page= 298[/tpl]  Before Roberts' switch to Methodism, Crutchfield arranged a meeting between Roberts and Bishop William Angie Smith, at which the Bishop told Roberts, "We need you, but we need the Holy Spirit more than we need you and we've got to have the Holy Spirit in the Methodist Church."

At the time, it was among the largest health facilities of its kind in the world and was intended to merge prayer and medicine in the healing process. The City of Faith operated for only eight years before closing in late 1989, but the importance of treating the whole person – spirit, mind, and body – was conveyed to many medical professionals.[tpl]cite news|title=Oral Roberts Dies|url=http://www.alrcnewskitchen.com/eblast/others/091215_orea.pdf|publisher=A.

Roberts' fundraising was controversial. In January 1987, during a fundraising drive, Roberts announced to a television audience that unless he raised $8 million by that March, God would "call him home."

Roberts maintained his love of finery and one obituary claimed that even when times become hard, "he continued to wear his Italian silk suits, diamond rings and gold bracelets – airbrushed out by his staff on publicity pictures".
He stirred up controversy when Time reported in 1987 that his son Richard Roberts claimed that he had seen his father raise a child from the dead.[tpl]cite news|url=http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964970,00.html|title=Raising Eyebrows and the Dead|publisher=Time|date=July 13, 1987|first=Richard|last=Ostling|accessdate=2007-01-04|authorlink=Richard Ostling[/tpl] That year, the Bloom County comic strip recast its character Bill the Cat as a satirized televangelist, "Fundamentally Oral Bill." In 1987 Time stated that he was "re-emphasizing faith healing and is reaching for his old-time constituency." However, his income continued to decrease (from $88 million in 1980 to $55 million in 1986, according to the Tulsa Tribune) and his largely vacant City of Faith Medical Center continued to lose money.
Harry McNevin said that in 1988 the ORU Board of Regents "rubber-stamped" the "use of millions in endowment money to buy a Beverly Hills property so that Oral Roberts could have a West Coast office and house".[tpl]cite news|last=Juozapavicius|first=Justin|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/08/AR2007110801341_pf.html|title=Oral Roberts' Son Accused of Misspending|work=The Washington Post|publisher=The Associated Press|date=November 8, 2007|accessdate=2009-12-18[/tpl] In addition, he said a country club membership was purchased for the Roberts' home. The lavish expenses led to McNevin's resignation from the Board. In 1988, Oral Roberts and his son Richard were sued for $15 million in federal court by patients at City of Faith Medical Center, claiming the two were frauds who did not visit or heal patients in the hospital.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&dat=19880804&id=qvY0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=JYgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4094,3044868 |title=Roberts Disputes Allegations In Suit | publisher=Bryan Times |date=August 4, 1988 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2318&dat=19880731&id=OhcpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AoUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2983,6178946 |title=Faith Healer Fails To Win Delay |publisher=Saturday Morning Deseret News |date=July 31, 1988 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat=19871017&id=1JdKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R5QMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1141,5374202 |title=Oral Roberts Sued For Failing To Cure Woman Of Hernia |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=October 17, 1987 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl]
His organizations were also affected by scandals involving other televangelists and the City of Faith hospital was forced to close in 1989 after losing money. Roberts was forced to respond with the sale of his holiday homes in Palm Springs and Beverly Hills as well as three of his Mercedes cars.
Oral Roberts' son Richard Roberts resigned from the presidency of ORU on November 23, 2007 after being named as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging improper use of university funds for political and personal purposes, and improper use of university resources.[tpl]cite news|title=Roberts resigns as ORU president|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&articleid=071123_1__Richa47602&archive=yes|publisher=Tulsa World|date=November 23, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Ziva|last=Branstetter|title=Roberts resigns|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&articleid=071124_1_A1_hMove11578&archive=yes|publisher=Tulsa World|date=November 24, 2007[/tpl] The university was given a donation of $8 million by entrepreneur Mart Green, and although the lawsuit was still in process,[tpl]cite web|title=ORU Lawsuit|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2007/oru-lawsuit/default.html|publisher=Tulsa World|accessdate=2010-01-09[/tpl] the school submitted to an outside audit, and with a good report an additional $62 million was given by Green.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-01-14-oralroberts-gift_N.htm|title=Oral Roberts University takes $62M gift|publisher=USA Today|date=January 15, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=ORU moves to trim its debt|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080214_1_A1_hTrus02181|publisher=Tulsa World|last=Marciszewski|first=April|date=February 14, 2008|accessdate=2010-01-09[/tpl] Oral Roberts continued in his role as ORU chancellor, helping in the leadership of ORU along with Billy Joe Daugherty, who was named as the executive regent to assume administrative responsibilities of the Office of the President by the ORU Board of Regents.[tpl]cite news|first=April|last=Marciszewski|title=Roberts takes ORU leave|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071018_1_A1_hTheO62814|publisher=Tulsa World|date=October 18, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-18[/tpl] Oral Roberts continued as the ORU chancellor until his death, but in 2009 eleven months before his death, handed over the leadership of ORU to its incoming president, Mark Rutland.[tpl]cite news|title=New ORU president says he has founder's blessing|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&articleid=20090130_11_A8_Oaoetn993404&archive=yes|publisher=Tulsa World|author=Sherman, Bill and Muchmore, Shannon|date=January 30, 2009|accessdate=2010-01-09[/tpl]

According to a 1987 article in the The New York Review of Books by Martin Gardner, the "most accurate and best documented biography is Oral Roberts: An American Life, an objective study by David Edwin Harrell Jr., a historian at Auburn University. Two out-of-print books take a more critical stance: James Morris' The Preachers (St. Martin's Press, 1973) and Jerry Sholes' Give Me That Prime-Time Religion (Hawthorn, 1979)."[tpl]cite web|author=Gardner, Martin|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1987/aug/13/giving-god-a-hand/|title=Giving God a Hand|publisher=The New York Review of Books|date=August 13, 1987|accessdate=2013-03-13[/tpl]
