Flinders Chase National Park is a protected area located at the west end of Kangaroo Island, South Australia, about [tpl]convert|213|km|abbr=0[/tpl] southwest of Adelaide and [tpl]convert|110|km|abbr=0[/tpl] west of Kingscote.  It is a sanctuary for endangered species and home to a few geological phenomena.  It was the second national park to be declared in South Australia.  It consists of three sections - an area of coastal landscapes around Cape du Couedic in the southwest, the Gosse Lands in the northeast and the former Cape Borda Lightstation reserve in the northwest.

==Sanctuary==

Since the creation of the national park in November 1919, Flinders Chase has become a sanctuary for endangered species, some of them introduced from the mainland in the 1920s and 1930s. During the 1940s, 23 additional species were introduced, including Koalas (1923) and Platypus (1928). Most of these species can still be observed today. Kangaroos, Goannas and Echidnas are commonly seen in the park.

It is believed that these colonies have since gone extinct, in part due to the increase of New Zealand fur seal populations since the end of commercial sealing.

==Geological wonders==

The park contains a few geological phenomena. Remarkable Rocks are naturally sculptured formations precariously balanced atop a granite outcrop. They remind visitors of the sculptures of Henry Moore.[tpl]Cite web|url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/10/AR2009071001673.html |title= Kangaroo Island Will Drive You Wild |author= Alice Reid |work= The Washington Post |date= July 12, 2009 |quote= The "Remarkable Rocks," as they are called, are a collection of enormous eroded granite boulders sitting atop a giant dome of lava coughed up about 200 million years ago. Wind and sea spray have since carved the chunks into what look like monumental Henry Moore sculptures perched 200 feet above a crashing sea. [/tpl]  Admirals Arch, home to playful New Zealand Fur Seals, displays the ability of the ocean to carve the coastline.
