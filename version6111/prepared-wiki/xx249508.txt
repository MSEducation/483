==Cricket career==

While at Oxford, Gibbs played in a one-day, single innings match against Eton College, opening the batting and scoring 10 runs, and then claiming two wickets as Eton beat them by seven wickets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/157/157806.html |title=Eton College v Christ Church College, Oxford |publisher=CricketArchive |date=8 June 1889 |accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] The next summer he played two matches for Somerset, during their successful 1890 season.

Playing against Lancashire at the County Ground, Taunton, Gibbs made six in both innings during a nine wicket defeat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3710.html |title=Somerset v Lancashire |publisher=CricketArchive |date=9 July 1891 |accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] That was his only first-class appearance of the season, his next coming eleven months later, playing for H Hewett's XII against Cambridge University.

During the English winter of 1892–93, Gibbs travelled to Ceylon and India as part of Lord Hawke's tour. Gibbs' top-score on the tour was 14, and although he bowled, he failed to take any wickets. During his only first-class match of the tour, against Bombay, Gibbs caught his Somerset team-mate John Trask in Bombay's second innings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3904.html |title=Bombay v Lord Hawke's XI |publisher=CricketArchive |date=26 December 1892 |accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] Gibbs made his highest score in first-class cricket, 75 against Oxford University for Somerset only a week after making a pair for the MCC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4116.html |title=Oxford University v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=24 May 1894 |accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4107.html |title=Marylebone Cricket Club v Derbyshire |publisher=CricketArchive |date=17 May 1894 |accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] The last of his five first-class appearances for Somerset was in June 1894,[tpl]cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3568/First-Class_Matches.html |title=First-Class Matches played by Joseph Gibbs (10) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl] in which he scored seven runs in his only innings of the match.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4139.html |title=Gloucestershire v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=14 June 1894 |accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl] His highest recorded score came two years later, playing in a one-day, single-innings match for the MCC against Dulwich. Opening the batting, Gibbs made 178 of the MCC's 358 runs, as they won by seven wickets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/253/253934.html |title=Dulwich v Marylebone Cricket Club |publisher=CricketArchive |date=26 May 1896 |accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl]
In his work, A Cotswold Village, Gibbs describes county cricket as being "a little over done", believing the time demands of the game, playing two three-day matches each week through the summer, too great. He thinks that an amateur who has received a good education, composed of public-school followed by university is wasting this education if they then send the majority of the week playing cricket each year. Despite this belief, he is in favour of some amateurs remaining in the game, to "prevent the further development of professionalism." Gibbs hypothesises that the "abnormal extent" of the development of cricket was due to the peaceful times that he lived in, but that in times of war, Englishmen would be glad of the useful lessons in courage and coolness that sport taught them.
