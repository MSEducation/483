==Format==

===Opening and listener call-in===

Each episode opens with an audio montage (usually created by Baxter[tpl]cite web|url=http://kevinandbeanarchive.com/Bean_Baxter_interview.pdf|title=Kevin and Bean Archive: Interview with Gene Baxter|date=18 November 2008|author = Baxter, Gene|work=Kevinandbeanarchive.com|accessdate=13 May 2010[/tpl]) featuring musical and audio clips that draw from current events in politics, pop-culture, and the news. Since 2008,[tpl]cite audio|people=Baxter, G., May, L., Ryder, K., Catherwood, M.D. (Hosts)|date=12 November 2008|title=The Kevin and Bean Show: What it do, Nephew? |url=http://www.kevinandbeanarchive.com/audio.php?dir=audio/LISTENER%20Call-in%20Topics/What%20It%20Do%20Nephew-%20What%20Is%20Your%20Deal&file=What%20It%20Do%20Nephew-2008-11-12.mp3|medium=Radio Broadcast|accessdate=13 May 2010[/tpl] the opening has featured a segment called "What it do, nephew?" where listeners are invited to phone in on a topic of their choosing. This segment has appeared in various forms throughout the show's history, and was previously known as "What is your deal" before being renamed after a phrase coined by rapper Snoop Dogg.[tpl]cite audio|people=Baxter, G., May, L., Ryder, K., Catherwood, M.D. (Hosts)|date=13 September 2006|title=The Kevin and Bean Show: What it do, Nephew? |url=http://www.kevinandbeanarchive.com/audio.php?dir=audio/LISTENER%20Call-in%20Topics/What%20It%20Do%20Nephew-%20What%20Is%20Your%20Deal&file=What%20Is%20Your%20Deal-2006-09-13-Now%20Called%20What%20It%20Do%20Nephew-Rosie%20On%20Treating%20Diaper%20Rash-Chris%20Pontius%20Sighting-Talk%20Like%20A%20Pirate%20Day%20Live%20Show.mp3|medium=Radio Broadcast|accessdate=13 May 2010[/tpl]
Recently though the segment of What It Do Nephew? has been taken away from the show.

===Hourly segments and The Showbiz Beat===

Music from the standard lineup of Kevin and Bean's flagship station, KROQ, is played regularly during the program. Creative control over the choice of music and how many songs are played per hour has been a source of conflict between the hosts and station management over the years.[tpl]cite audio|people=Baxter, G., et al. (Hosts)|date=2 September 2009|title=The Kevin and Bean Show |url=http://www.kevinandbeanarchive.com/audio.php?dir=audio/LISTENER%20Call-in%20Topics&file=What%20Is%20The%20Deal%20With%20The%20Song%20Fireflies-2009-09-02-Listener%20Call-in.mp3|medium=Radio Broadcast|accessdate=14 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite audio|people=Baxter, G., et al.

Because of the show's position as a morning drive-time program, traffic and news segments are also interspersed between the  other material. Newscaster Boyd Britton, known as "Doc on the Roq", provides a brief hourly summary of current events, while Los Angeles-area traffic updates are provided by metro traffic reporter and Kevin and Bean co-host Lisa May.[tpl]Citation |last = Oliver|first=Myrna|title='Real' Don Steele, Style-Setting L.A.

"The Showbiz Beat" is an hourly entertainment-news report featuring Ryder and Baxter's actor co-host Ralph Garman and is one of the program's longest-running segments.[tpl]Citation |last=Carney|first=Steve|title=Keeping it together on the air|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|pages=E.3|date=28 May 2003|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=341109701&sid=3&Fmt=3&clientId=17934&RQT=309&VName=PQD|accessdate=14 May 2010[/tpl] Before the top of every hour, Garman highlights stories from pop culture and media and, with input from his colleagues, frequently mocks perceived hypocrisies and absurdities of public figures and the entertainment industry. The segment always concludes with an announcement of the day's birthdays for celebrities of varying degrees of fame.

===Recurring segments===

A large portion of the show's material is made up of segments that recur periodically. Many of these are based on listener participation, and involve the hosts taking calls on an interesting discussion topic or for a guest, or involve games and contests that have been created around the station's promotional giveaways. Ryder and Baxter will also occasionally read emails sent to them, and play messages from the show's voice mail service, known as the "Afro Line." Other segments focus on the hosts and their personalities and quirks, like "Thanks for That Info, Bean", which pokes fun at Baxter's intense interest in seemingly trivial topics, and "A Moment with...", where a humorous audio clip of a statement made on-air by a host is replayed. "Would You Like to Take That Back?" is another feature during which the hosts give each other the option of "taking back" an unsuccessful or poorly delivered joke or pun.[tpl]cite audio|people=Garman, R., Ryder, K. et al.

Several segments feature regular guests, including weekly interviews with TMZ.com's Harvey Levin,[tpl]cite audio|people=Levin, H. et al.

Since January 2010, Dr. Drew Pinsky, whose syndicated radio program Loveline is broadcast out of KROQ, has also appeared frequently on the program.[tpl]cite audio|people=Baxter, G., Pinsky, D., Ryder, K. et al. (Guest and Hosts)|date=14 Jan 2010|title=The Kevin and Bean Show |url=http://www.kevinandbeanarchive.com/audio.php?dir=audio/-------ALL%20PREVIOUS%20FILES%20FOR%20MONTH%20OF-JANUARY%202010----/-------January%2014%20Thursday-------&file=07%20Dr%20Drew-2010-01-14-Celebrity%20Rehab.mp3|medium=Radio Broadcast|accessdate=3 June 2010[/tpl]
Some of the most popular (and controversial) pieces have involved vocal impressions and celebrity impersonations, which are typically voiced by Ralph Garman and former Kevin and Bean assistant producer and Loveline co-host "Psycho" Mike Catherwood.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local-beat/Loveline-Gets-New-Co-Host-Late-Late-Timeslot-87840537.html|title="Loveline" Gets New Co-Host, Late-Late Time Slot|first=Jenna |last=Briand |date = 16 March 2010|publisher=NBC Los Angeles|accessdate=3 June 2010[/tpl] Often, Ryder and Baxter will conduct fake interviews with celebrities like Spencer Pratt, Gene Simmons, Sean Connery, and Kevin Federline, while on other occasions impressions might involve a relatively unknown person in a news story or current event. Garman and Catherwood have also created several alter-egos, including Loquecia, an African-American woman who reviews and ridicules reality television shows, and Rudy, a stereotypical heavily accented cholo with a penchant for marijuana use.

===Celebrity interviews===

In addition to faux interviews, numerous real celebrities and sports figures have appeared on the show over the years. Regular visitors to the show include Kevin Smith, Kathy Griffin, Petros Papadakis, Joe Rogan, and Olivia Munn. Other notable guests include Seth MacFarlane, Andrew Siciliano, Joel McHale, Bill Simmons, Adam Sessler, Mike Rowe, Landon Donovan, Alex Borstein, Tracy Morgan, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Travis Pastrana, Russell Martin, Will Ferrell, David Alan Grier, Jay Mohr and more.

===Closing segments===

While the program generally ends with a short preview of the next show, on Fridays the show closes (and opens) with a cover of "Don't Bogart Me" by Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise (a song first performed by the band Fraternity of Man), as performed by the hosts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kroq-data.com/kevinandbean/faq.asp|title=Kevin and Bean FAQ|publisher=KROQ|quote=What's the name of that Bogart song? Don't Bogart Me by Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise, available on "Hempilation 2."[/tpl]

==History==

Kevin and Bean debuted on KROQ on December 31, 1989, when they hosted the annual countdown of the year's best songs. On June 13, 1990, the show aired a segment called "Confess Your Crime", which included a bogus phone call from fellow DJ Doug "The Slug" Roberts (who was then working at KZZP) as an anonymous listener claiming to have committed murder. The parents of a missing woman believed the fictional caller to be responsible for their daughter's death leading to an investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and coverage in an episode of Unsolved Mysteries. When the truth was revealed, the station was billed for the costs of the investigation by the LASD,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,434699~7~0~ajerrylewishoax,00.html|title=Jerry Rigged|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=2003-03-19|first=Liane|last=Bonin|accessdate=2006-08-19[/tpl] and sued by the distraught parents.  KROQ suspended Kevin and Bean for five days without pay, directed each of them to perform 149 hours of community service, and forced them to pay the Sheriff’s bill out of their pockets.  The event also became the inspiration behind the 1996 movie Power 98 starring Eric Roberts.
In March 2003, the show caused international controversy when Ralph made a prank phone call to the office of French president Jacques Chirac while posing as Jerry Lewis.  All were surprised when Chirac picked up the phone and began talking to "Jerry."  Lewis' lawyers were quick to threaten with lawsuits and the bit has rarely been spoken of since.  Though they appear to be under orders not to speak of the matter, Kevin and Bean have made oblique suggestions that Lewis "blackmailed" Kevin and Bean into making a contribution to the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the beneficiary of Lewis' annual Labor Day telethon.
In January 2004, a Los Angeles man filed a breach of contract suit against the station and Kevin and Bean saying he was cheated out of a free SUV.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.entertainyourbrain.com/tvnews1120411804.htm|title=TV News 01/12/2004|publisher=Entertain your brain|date=2004-01-12|accessdate=2006-08-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060318230737/http://www.entertainyourbrain.com/tvnews1120411804.htm  |archivedate = 2006-03-18[/tpl]  Though Kevin and Bean do not address specific lawsuits on the air, they often refer to being frequently sued, usually in the context of people not understanding or appreciating their attempts at humor.
In August 2007, a listener e-mailed a complaint to Kevin and Bean as well as put an article in The Advocate Magazine (Gay & Lesbian Magazine). The complaint was about a parody that Psycho Mike of the Kevin and Bean show did titled "Lean Like a Homo", and was made to make fun of Down's "Lean like a Cholo".
On May 8, 2009 – Westwood One announced that it will begin airing The Kevin & Bean Show on radio stations nationwide on May 11, 2009.
On September 15, 2011 Kevin and Bean won the NAB Marconi Radio Award for "Major Market Personality of the Year".
