Vacuum is space that is devoid of matter. The word stems from the Latin adjective vacuus for "vacant" or "void". An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure.[tpl]Cite book |first=Austin |last=Chambers |year=2004 |title=Modern Vacuum Physics |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |isbn=0-8493-2438-6 |oclc=55000526[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]  Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call "vacuum" or free space, and use the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a laboratory or in space. The Latin term in vacuo is used to describe an object as being in what would otherwise be a vacuum.
The quality of a partial vacuum refers to how closely it approaches a perfect vacuum. Other things equal, lower gas pressure means higher-quality vacuum. For example, a typical vacuum cleaner produces enough suction to reduce air pressure by around 20%.[tpl]cite book |last=Campbell |first=Jeff |year=2005 |isbn=1-59486-274-5 |page=97 |title=Speed cleaning |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hqegeIz9dyQC&pg=PA97[/tpl] Note that 1 inch of water is ≈0.0025 atm. Much higher-quality vacuums are possible. Ultra-high vacuum chambers, common in chemistry, physics, and engineering, operate below one trillionth (10−12) of atmospheric pressure (100 nPa), and can reach around 100 particles/cm3. Outer space is an even higher-quality vacuum, with the equivalent of just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter on average.[ref]
