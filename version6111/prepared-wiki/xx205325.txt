==History==

After the success of Houston's first studio album in eight years, the singer embarked on her first world tour since 1994 to promote it. For the North American leg, Houston turned down most of the arena dates in favor of theaters because she wanted "to do something where people can feel her and she can feel them."1999: Nippy News Release Articles This allowed the shows to have a jam-session kind of feel. Since theaters have lower capacities than arenas, Houston played in most North American cities for two nights each.
Houston signed a deal with Dolce & Gabbana. They would design all of Houston's clothes for the tour. This gave Houston a more hip and contemporary look in to match her music in contrast to her previous tours. Houston first showcased her new edgy wardrobe on The Oprah Winfrey Show prior to the tour opener in Chicago.
In July Houston made a surprise appearance at the 13th Annual New York City Lesbian and Gay Pride Dance. At the event, the singer did a rare performance of the popular remixes to "It's Not Right But It's OK" and "Heartbreak Hotel".Whitney Houston Surprises Crowd At Gay-Lesbian Pride Event MTV News.

Controversy arose during the North American leg of the tour. There were reports of strange and erratic behavior behind the scenes. Houston cancelled some of the dates, including two shows in her hometown of Newark. The singer pulled out of her San Francisco show at the Concord Pavilion 15 minutes before the start; the city demanded $100,000 in compensation after public outcry. Houston blamed all the cancellations on an ongoing throat ailment. Still, these actions would further spark drug use rumour in the tabloids.Entertainment: News in Brief. BBC News. August 26, 1999.
The tour was successful. The concerts featured Houston's highest ticket prices. With many shows, Houston commanded up to $150 for a ticket, making her just one of a few artists to break the $100 barrier.Farber, Jim. "Summer concert tours, paved with profits and with potholes".

The tour was an even bigger success in Europe however. It was the highest grossing arena concert tour of the year in the continent while playing to almost half a million people. Every date was sold out in advanced. As a result, the tour had to be extended to November due to high demand.
