Its area measures approximately [tpl]convert|7000|ha[/tpl]. Fed by rivers from surrounding hills, the largest is Ruiza River. The lake is visible from Useni or Kavari. Papyrus swamps and groundwater forest areas occur around the lake. The surrounding hills are brown, with dark green bush scatterings.Its receding waters have left great extents of flat plain on the sides and around the bays running far inland into valleys. The lake is sunk about [tpl]convert|1200|ft[/tpl] below the average level of the bare grassy hills around it. There is a narrow basin at the head of the lake.  Its shore is broken by numerous inlets.
The Yanghiro district, which is situated on the eastern shore of the Urigi, is a hilly region, scattered over with villages and cultivated fields, as well as with woods of banana-trees.

==Flora and fauna==

Its shores and waters are favored by birds, such as cranes, herons, pelicans, African Jacanas, egrets and waders, which find excellent feeding over the large spaces near the extremities and shore line of bays.  These are covered with close-packed growths of Pistia stratiotes rigl plants. Kobus ellipsiprymnus and Hippopotamus amphibius frequent the area.[tpl]cite book|author1=R. H. Hughes|author2=J. S.
