Dietrich remained popular throughout her long career by continually re-inventing herself, professionally and characteristically. In the Berlin of the 1920s, she acted on the stage and in silent films. Her performance as Lola-Lola in The Blue Angel (1930), directed by Josef von Sternberg, brought her international fame and garnered her a contract with Paramount Pictures in the US. Hollywood films such as Shanghai Express (1932) and Desire (1936) capitalised on her glamour and exotic looks, cementing her stardom and making her one of the highest-paid actresses of the era. Dietrich became a U.S. citizen in 1939,Dietrich applied for US citizenship in 1937 ("Marlene Dietrich to be US Citizen". Painesville Telegraph, 6 March 1937.); it was granted in 1939 (see "Citizen Soon". The Telegraph Herald, 10 March 1939. and "Seize Luggage of Marlene Dietrich". Lawrence Journal World, 14 June 1939). and throughout World War II she was a high-profile frontline entertainer. Although she still made occasional films in the post-war years, Dietrich spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a successful show performer.
In 1999, the American Film Institute named Dietrich the ninth-greatest female star of all time.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==Childhood==

Marie Magdalene Dietrich was born on 27 December 1901 in Leberstrasse 65 on the Rote Insel in  Schöneberg, now a district of Berlin, Germany. She was the younger of two daughters (her sister Elisabeth was a year older) of Wilhelmina Elisabeth Josephine (née Felsing) and Louis Erich Otto Dietrich, who married in December 1898. Dietrich's mother was from a well-to-do Berlin family who owned a clockmaking firm, and her father was a police lieutenant who died in 1907.[tpl]cite book|author=Bach, Steven|title= Marlene Dietrich: Life and Legend|publisher= University of Minnesota Press|date= 2011|page=  19[/tpl] His best friend Eduard von Losch, an aristocrat first lieutenant in the Grenadiers, courted Wilhelmina and married her in 1916, but he died soon afterward from injuries sustained during World War I.Born as Maria Magdalena, not Marie Magdalene, according to Dietrich's biography by her daughter, Maria Riva titled Marlene Dietrich, ISBN 0-394-58692-1; however Dietrich's bio by Charlotte Chandler, Marlene(2011), ISBN 978-1-4391-8835-4, cites "Marie Magdalene" as her birth name, on page 12 Eduard von Losch never officially adopted the Dietrich girls, so Dietrich's surname was never von Losch, as has sometimes been claimed. Family nicknamed her "Lena" and "Lene" (pronounced Lay-neh). Around age 11, she contracted her two first names to form the name "Marlene".
Dietrich attended the Auguste-Viktoria girls school from 1907 to 1917Bach 1992, p. 20. and graduated from the Victoria-Luise-Schule (today Goethe-Gymnasium Berlin-Wilmersdorf) in 1918.Bach 1992, p. 26. She studied the violinBach 1992, p. 32. and became interested in theatre and poetry as a teenager. Her dreams of becoming a concert violinist were curtailed when she injured her wrist,Bach 1992, p. 39. but by 1922 she had her first job, playing violin in a pit orchestra that accompanied silent films at a cinema in Berlin. However, she was fired after only four weeks.Bach 1992, p. 42.

==Early career==

Her earliest professional stage appearances were as a chorus girl on tour with Guido Thielscher's Girl-Kabarett, vaudeville-style entertainments, and in Rudolf Nelson revues in Berlin.Bach 1992, p. 44. In 1922, Dietrich auditioned unsuccessfully for theatrical director and impresario Max Reinhardt's drama academy;Bach 1992, p. 49. however, she soon found herself working in his theaters as a chorus girl and playing small roles in dramas, without attracting any special attention at first. She made her film debut playing a bit part in the film, The Little Napoleon (1923).Bach 1992, p. 491.
She met her future husband, Rudolf Sieber, on the set of another film made that year, Tragödie der Liebe. Dietrich and Sieber were married in a civil ceremony in Berlin on 17 May 1923.Bach, Steven. "Marlene Dietrich: Life and Legend". University of Minnesota Press, 2011. Page 62. Her only child, daughter Maria Elisabeth Sieber, was born on 13 December 1924.Bach 1992, p. 65.
Dietrich continued to work on stage and in film both in Berlin and Vienna throughout the 1920s. On stage, she had roles of varying importance in Frank Wedekind's Pandora's Box,Bach 1992, p. 480. William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew and A Midsummer Night's DreamBach 1992, p. 482. as well as George Bernard Shaw's Back to MethuselahBach 1992, p. 483. and Misalliance.Bach 1992, p. 488. It was in musicals and revues, such as Broadway, Es Liegt in der Luft, and Zwei Krawatten, however, that she attracted the most attention. By the late 1920s, Dietrich was also playing sizable parts on screen, including Café Elektric (1927), Ich küsse Ihre Hand, Madame (1928) and Das Schiff der verlorenen Menschen (1929).[tpl]cite web|title=Ship of Lost Men (Das Schiff der verlorenen Menschen) (1929)|url=http://www.amazon.com/Ship-Lost-Schiff-verlorenen-Menschen/dp/B008L1GDK6|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=17 May 2013[/tpl]

==Film star==

===Breakthrough in The Blue Angel===

In 1929, Dietrich landed the breakthrough role of Lola Lola, a cabaret singer who causes the downfall of a hitherto respected schoolmaster, in UFA's production The Blue Angel (1930). Josef von Sternberg directed the film and thereafter took credit for having "discovered" Dietrich. The film is also noteworthy for having introduced Dietrich's signature song "Falling in Love Again", which she recorded for Electrola and later made further recordings in the 1930s for Polydor and Decca Records.

===Paramount Pictures===

On the strength of The Blue Angel's international success, and with encouragement and promotion from von Sternberg, who was already established in Hollywood, Dietrich then moved to the U.S. under contract to Paramount Pictures. The studio sought to market Dietrich as a German answer to MGM's Swedish sensation, Greta Garbo.
right|thumb|255px|A still from Shanghai Express (1932). Josef von Sternberg used butterfly lighting to enhance Dietrich's features. This photograph was cited by Mick Rock as the inspiration for the iconic Queen II album cover. Dietrich starred in six films directed by von Sternberg at Paramount between 1930 and 1935: von Sternberg worked very effectively with Dietrich to create the image of a glamorous femme fatale. He encouraged her to lose weight and coached her intensively as an actress—she, in turn, was willing to trust him and follow his sometimes imperious direction in a way that a number of other performers resisted.See e.g., David Thomson (1975). A Biographical Dictionary of the Cinema. London, Secker and Warburg. Page 587: "He was not an easy man to be directed by. Many actors—notably Emil Jannings and William Powell—reacted violently to him. Dietrich adored him, and trusted him...."
Their first American collaboration, Morocco (1930), again cast her as a cabaret singer; the film is best remembered for the sequence in which she performs a song dressed in a man's white tie and kisses another woman, both provocative for the era. The film earned Dietrich her only Oscar nomination.
Morocco was followed by Dishonored (1931), with Dietrich as a Mata Hari-like spy) and Blonde Venus (1932). Shanghai Express (1932) was von Sternberg and Dietrich's biggest box office hit. Their last two films, The Scarlet Empress (1934)and The Devil Is a Woman (1935)—the most stylized of their collaborations—were their least commercial ventures. Dietrich later remarked that she was at her most beautiful in The Devil Is a Woman.
A crucial part of the overall effect was created by von Sternberg's exceptional skill in lighting and photographing Dietrich to optimum effect—the use of light and shadow, including the impact of light passed through a veil or slatted blinds (as for example in Shanghai Express)—which, when combined with scrupulous attention to all aspects of set design and costumes, make this series of films among the most visually stylish in cinema history.See, for example, David Thomson, A Biographical Dictionary of the Cinema. London, Secker and Warburg, 1975, entry for Dietrich: "With him Sternberg Dietrich made seven masterpieces Blue Angel in Germany and the six in Hollywood, films that are still breathtakingly modern, which have no superior for their sense of artificiality suffused with emotion and which visually combine decadence and austerity, tenderness and cruelty, gaiety and despair." Critics still vigorously debate how much of the credit belonged to von Sternberg and how much to Dietrich, but most would agree that neither consistently reached such heights again after Paramount fired von Sternberg and the two ceased working together.See, for example, the entries for Dietrich and von Sternberg in David Thomson, A Biographical Dictionary of the Cinema (1975).
Dietrich's first film after the end of her partnership with von Sternberg was Frank Borzage's Desire (1936), a commercial success that gave Dietrich an opportunity to try her hand at romantic comedy. Her next project, I Loved a Soldier (1936) ended in a shambles when the film was scrapped several weeks into production due, to script problems and disagreements between the star and her director.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Box Office Poison===

Extravagant offers lured Dietrich away from Paramount to make The Garden of Allah (1936) for independent producer David O. Selznick (she received $200,000) and to Britain for Alexander Korda's production, Knight Without Armour (1937) (at a salary of $450,000). Although she was now one of the best paid film stars, her vehicles were costly to produce and neither of the latter two films was financially successful. By this time, Dietrich ranked 126th at the box office and exhibitors labelled her "Box Office Poison" (alongside others like Fred Astaire, Joan Crawford, Dolores del Río, Katharine Hepburn, and Mae West).
While she was in London, officials of the Nazi Party approached Dietrich and offered her lucrative contracts, should she agree to return to Germany as a foremost film star in the Third Reich. She refused their offers and applied for US citizenship in 1937.[tpl]cite news|last=Helm|first=Toby|title=Film star felt ashamed of Belsen link|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1344765/Film-star-felt-ashamed-of-Belsen-link.html|accessdate=18 May 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=24 June 2000[/tpl]
She returned to Paramount to make another romantic comedy, Angel (1937, directed by Ernst Lubitsch); reception to the film was so lukewarm that Paramount bought out the remainder of Dietrich's contract. When film projects at other studios fell through, Dietrich and her family set sail for an extended holiday in Europe.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Comeback in Destry Rides Again===

In 1939, she accepted producer Joe Pasternak's offer (and a pay cut[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]) to play against type in her first film in two years: that of the cowboy saloon girl, Frenchie, in the light-hearted western Destry Rides Again, opposite James Stewart. The bawdy role revived her career and "The Boys in the Back Room", a song she introduced in the film, became a hit when she recorded it for Decca.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] She played similar types in Seven Sinners (1940) and The Spoilers (1942), both opposite John Wayne.
While Dietrich arguably never fully regained her former screen glory,[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] she continued performing in the movies, including appearances for such distinguished directors as Alfred Hitchcock, Fritz Lang, Orson Welles, and Billy Wilder, in films that included A Foreign Affair (1948), Stage Fright (1950), Rancho Notorious (1952), Witness for the Prosecution (1957), and Touch of Evil (1958).

==World War II==

Dietrich was known to have strong political convictions and the mind to speak them. In interviews, Dietrich stated that she had been approached by representatives of the Nazi Party to return to Germany but had turned them down flat. Dietrich, a staunch anti-Nazi, became an American citizen in 1939.
In December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II, and Dietrich became one of the first celebrities to raise war bonds. She toured the US from January 1942 to September 1943 (appearing before 250,000 troops on the Pacific Coast leg of her tour alone) and was reported to have sold more war bonds than any other star.Sudendorf, Werner.[tpl]cite web|website=MarleneDietrich.org|url=http://www.marlenedietrich.org/plusMuseum6.htm |title=Thanks Soldier|date= 2000|accessdate=2010-02-20[/tpl]
During two extended tours for the USO in 1944 and 1945, she performed for Allied troops on the front lines in Algeria, Italy, Britain, and France and went into Germany with Generals James M. Gavin and George S. Patton. When asked why she had done this, in spite of the obvious danger of being within a few kilometres of German lines, she replied, "aus Anstand"—"out of decency".[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Her revue, with future TV pioneer Danny Thomas as her opening act, included songs from her films, performances on her musical saw (a skill she had originally acquired for stage appearances in Berlin in the 1920s), and a pretend "mindreading" act. Dietrich would inform the audience that she could read minds and ask them to concentrate on whatever came into their minds. Then she would walk over to a soldier and earnestly tell him, "Oh, think of something else. I can't possibly talk about that!"  American church papers reportedly published stories complaining about this part of Dietrich's act.
In 1944, the Morale Operations Branch of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) initiated the Musak project,[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2008-featured-story-archive/marlene-dietrich.html|title=A Look Back ...

Dietrich, the only performer who was made aware that her recordings would be for OSS use, recorded a number of songs in German for the project, including "Lili Marleen", a favorite of soldiers on both sides of the conflict.[tpl]cite book|author=McIntosh, Elizabeth P|date=1998|title= Sisterhood of Spies: The Women of the OSS|page= 58|publisher= Dell|location= London|isbn= 0-440-23466-2[/tpl] Major General William J.

At the war's end in Europe, Dietrich reunited with her sister Elisabeth and her sister's husband and son. The family resided in the German city of Belsen throughout the war years running a movie theatre for Nazi officers and officials who oversaw the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Dietrich interceded with Allied officials on behalf of her relatives, sheltering them from possible prosecution as Nazi collaborators.[tpl]cite book|title=Marlene Dietrich: Her Own Song|publisher= TCM documentary|date= 2001[/tpl]
Dietrich was awarded the Medal of Freedom by the US in 1945. She said this was her proudest accomplishment. She was also awarded the Légion d'honneur by the French government as recognition for her wartime work.[tpl]cite web|title=Marlene Dietrich : Biography|url=http://www.whoswho.de/templ/te_bio.php?PID=198&RID=1|work=Who's Who – The People Lexicon|publisher=www.whoswho.de|accessdate=5 January 2013|language=German|quote=Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur  and  Officier de la Légion d'Honneur[/tpl]

==Stage and cabaret==

thumb|upright|Dietrich often performed parts of her show in top hat and tails. Caricature by Hans Georg Pfannmüller showing Dietrich during a cabaret performance in 1954.From the early 1950s until the mid-1970s, Dietrich worked almost exclusively as a highly paid cabaret artist, performing live in large theaters in major cities worldwide.
In 1953, Dietrich was offered a then-substantial $30,000 per weekBach 1992, p. 369. to appear live at the Sahara HotelBach 1992, p. 368. on the Las Vegas Strip. The show was short, consisting only of a few songs associated with her. Her daringly sheer "nude dress"—a heavily beaded evening gown of silk soufflé, which gave the illusion of transparency—designed by Jean Louis, attracted a lot of publicity. This engagement was so successful that she was signed to appear at the Café de Paris in London the following year; her Las Vegas contracts were also renewed.Bach 1992, p. 371.
Dietrich employed Burt Bacharach as her musical arranger starting in the mid-1950s; together they refined her nightclub act into a more ambitious theatrical one-woman show with an expanded repertoire.Bach 1992, p. 395. Her repertoire included songs from her films as well as popular songs of the day. Bacharach's arrangements helped to disguise Dietrich's limited vocal range—she was a contralto[tpl]cite web|last=Carpenter|first=Cassie|title=Cassie's Corner: Marlene Dietrich's Top 10 Badass One-Liners|url=http://laslush.com/2011/08/09/739/|work=L.A Slush|archivedate=12 January 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120112192350/http://laslush.com/2011/08/09/739/|date=9 August 2011[/tpl]—and allowed her to perform her songs to maximum dramatic effect; together, they recorded four albums and several singles between 1957 and 1964.[tpl]cite book | title=The Amazing Blonde Woman: Dietrich's Own Style | publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing | last=O'Connor | first=Patrick | year=1991 | location=London | page=154 | isbn=0-7475-1264-7[/tpl] In a TV interview in 1971, she credited Bacharach with giving her the "inspiration" to perform during those years."Marlene Dietrich 1971 Copenhagen Interview", 1/2 hour video
She would often perform the first part of her show in one of her body-hugging dresses and a swansdown coat, and change to top hat and tails for the second half of the performance.Bach 1992, p. 394. This allowed her to sing songs usually associated with male singers, like "One for My Baby" and "I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face".
"She ... transcends her material," according to Peter Bogdanovich. "Whether it's a flighty old tune like 'I Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby' ... a schmaltzy German love song, 'Das Lied ist Aus' or a French one 'La Vie en Rose', she lends each an air of the aristocrat, yet she never patronises ... A folk song, 'Go 'Way From My Window' has never been sung with such passion, and in her hands 'Where Have All the Flowers Gone?' is not just another anti-war lament but a tragic accusation against us all."Morley 1978, p. 69.
Francis Wyndham offered a more critical appraisal of the phenomenon of Dietrich in concert. He wrote in 1964: "What she does is neither difficult nor diverting, but the fact that she does it at all fills the onlookers with wonder ... It takes two to make a conjuring trick: the illusionist's sleight of hand and the stooge's desire to be deceived. To these necessary elements (her own technical competence and her audience's sentimentality) Marlene Dietrich adds a third—the mysterious force of her belief in her own magic. Those who find themselves unable to share this belief tend to blame themselves rather than her."O'Connor, 1991. p. 133.
Her use of body-sculpting undergarments, nonsurgical temporary facelifts, expert makeup, and wigs,Bach 1992, p. 406. combined with careful stage lighting, helped to preserve Dietrich's glamorous image as she grew older.
Dietrich's return to Germany in 1960 for a concert tour elicited a mixed response. Many Germans felt she had betrayed her homeland by her actions during World War II. During her performances at Berlin's Titania Palast theatre, protesters chanted, "Marlene Go Home!" On the other hand, Dietrich was warmly welcomed by other Germans, including Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt, who was, like Dietrich, an opponent of the Nazis who had lived in exile during their rule.Bach 1992, p. 401. The tour was an artistic triumph, but a financial failure. She also undertook a tour of Israel around the same time, which was well-received; she sang some songs in German during her concerts, including, from 1962, a German version of Pete Seeger's anti-war anthem "Where Have All the Flowers Gone", thus breaking the unofficial taboo against the use of German in Israel. Dietrich in London, a concert album, was recorded during the run of her 1964 engagement at the Queen's Theatre.Bach, 1992. p. 526.
She performed on Broadway twice (in 1967 and 1968) and won a special Tony Award in 1968. In November 1972,  I Wish You Love, a version of Dietrich's Broadway show titled An Evening With Marlene Dietrich, was filmed in London.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.marlenedietrich.org/noteIwish.htm |title=I Wish You Love Production Schedule |accessdate=11 October 2008 |work=Marlene Dietrich Collection Berlin[/tpl] She was paid $250,000 for her cooperation but was unhappy with the result. The show was broadcast in the UK on the BBC and in the US on CBS in January 1973.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
In her sixties and seventies, Dietrich's health declined: she survived cervical cancer in 1965Bach 1992, p. 416. and suffered from poor circulation in her legs. Dietrich became increasingly dependent on painkillers and alcohol. A stage fall at the Shady Grove Music Fair in Maryland in 1973 injured her left thigh, necessitating skin grafts to allow the wound to heal.Bach 1992, p. 436. She fractured her right leg in August 1974.Bach 1992, p. 437. "Do you think this is glamorous? That it's a great life and that I do it for my health? Well it isn't. Maybe once, but not now," Dietrich told Clive Hirschhorn in 1973, explaining that she continued performing only for the money.Morley 1978, p. 72.

==Final years==

Dietrich's show business career largely ended on 29 September 1975, when she fell off the stage and broke her thigh during a performance in Sydney, Australia.'Act follows suggestion of song's title', Toledo Blade, Ohio 7 Nov. 1973, p. 37. The following year, her husband, Rudolf Sieber, died of cancer on 24 June 1976.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
thumb|upright|Dietrich's gravestone in Berlin. The inscription reads "Hier steh ich an den Marken meiner Tage" ("Here I stand at the milestone of my days"), a paraphrased line from the sonnet "Abschied vom Leben" ("Farewell from Life") by Theodor Körner. Dietrich's final on-camera film appearance was a cameo role in Just a Gigolo (1979), starring David Bowie and directed by David Hemmings, in which she sang the title song.
An alcoholic dependent on painkillers, Dietrich withdrew to her apartment at 12 Avenue Montaigne in Paris. She spent the final 11 years of her life mostly bedridden, allowing only a select few—-including family and employees—-to enter the apartment. During this time, she was a prolific letter-writer and phone-caller. Her autobiography, Nehmt nur mein Leben (Take Just My Life), was published in 1979.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
In 1982, Dietrich agreed to participate in a documentary film about her life, Marlene (1984), but refused to be filmed. The film's director, Maximilian Schell, was allowed only to record her voice. He used his interviews with her as the basis for the film, set to a collage of film clips from her career. The final film won several European film prizes and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary in 1984. Newsweek named it "a unique film, perhaps the most fascinating and affecting documentary ever made about a great movie star".[tpl]cite web |title=Marlene |url=http://www.atlasfilm.com/00000198640aab305/03227898d60a6720a/03227899d50c45007.htm |accessdate=26 January 2009 |work=Atlas International[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In 1988, Dietrich recorded spoken introductions to songs for a nostalgia album by Udo Lindenberg.Bach, 1992. p 528.
In an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel in November 2005, Dietrich's daughter and grandson claim that Dietrich was politically active during these years.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,384700,00.html |title=Der Himmel war grün, wenn sie es sagte|work=Der Spiegel|date= 13 November 2005[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl] She kept in contact with world leaders by telephone, including Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, running up a monthly bill of over US$3,000.

Her closed coffin rested beneath the altar draped in the French flag and adorned with a simple bouquet of white wildflowers and roses from the French President, François Mitterrand. Three medals, including France's Legion of Honor and the US Medal of Freedom, were displayed at the foot of the coffin, military style, for a ceremony symbolizing the sense of duty Dietrich embodied in her career as an actress, and in her personal fight against Nazism.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dietrich instructed in her will that she was to be buried in her birthplace, Berlin, near her family; on 16 May her body was flown there to fulfill her wish.  Dietrich was interred at the Städtischer Friedhof III, Berlin-Schöneberg, Stubenrauchstraße 43–45, in Friedenau Cemetery, next to the grave of her mother, Josefine von Loschand, and near the house where she was born.

==Private life==

Unlike her professional celebrity, which was carefully crafted and maintained, Dietrich's personal life was kept out of public view. Dietrich, who was bisexual, enjoyed the thriving gay scene of the time and drag balls of 1920s Berlin.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-4512.html |title=Bisexual side of Dietrich show |first=Amy |last=Bourke |date=29 May 2007 |work=Pink News[/tpl] She also defied conventional gender roles through her boxing at Turkish trainer and prizefighter Sabri Mahir’s boxing studio in Berlin, which opened to women in the late 1920s. As Austrian writer Hedwig (Vicki) Baum recalls in her memoir, "I don't know how the feminine element sneaked into those masculine realms boxing studio, but in any case, only three or four of us were tough enough to go through with it (Marlene Dietrich was one)."Baum cited in Gammel, Irene (2012), "Lacing up the Gloves: Women, Boxing and Modernity". Cultural and Social History 9.3, p. 372.
She was married only once, to assistant director Rudolf Sieber, who later became an assistant director at Paramount Pictures in France, responsible for foreign language dubbing. Dietrich's only child, Maria Elisabeth Sieber, was born in Berlin on 13 December 1924. She would later become an actress, primarily working in television, known as Maria Riva. When Maria gave birth to a son (John, a famous production designer) in 1948, Dietrich was dubbed "the world's most glamorous grandmother". After Dietrich's death, Riva published a frank biography of her mother, titled Marlene Dietrich (1992).[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Throughout her career Dietrich had an unending string of affairs, some short-lived, some lasting decades; they often overlapped and were almost all known to her husband, to whom she was in the habit of passing the love letters of her men, sometimes with biting comments.Riva, p. 344 When Dietrich filmed Morocco (1930) she found time to have an affair with Gary Cooper, despite the constant presence on the set of the temperamental Mexican actress Lupe Vélez, with whom Cooper was having a romance.http://www.historyonfilm.com/actors/gary-cooper.htm[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] History on Film: Actors: Gary Cooper Vélez once said: "If I had the opportunity to do so, I would tear the eyes to Marlene Dietrich".[tpl]cite book|last=|first=|title=Revista Vanidades de México: Año 46 no. 12 Marlene Dietrich |publisher=Editorial Televisa S.A. de C.V|year=2006|page= 141|issn= 1665-7519[/tpl] During the filming of Destry Rides Again, Dietrich started a love affair with co-star James Stewart, which ended after filming. In 1938, Dietrich met and began a relationship with the writer Erich Maria Remarque, and in 1941, the French actor and military hero Jean Gabin. Their relationship ended in the mid-1940s. She also had an affair with the Cuban-American writer Mercedes de Acosta, who was Greta Garbo's periodic lover. Her last great passion, when Dietrich was in her 50s, appears to have been for the actor Yul Brynner, with whom she had an affair that lasted more than a decade; still, her love life continued well into her 70s. She counted George Bernard Shaw, John F. Kennedy and John Wayne among her conquests.Riva, passim Dietrich maintained her husband and his mistress first in Europe and later on a ranch in San Fernando Valley, California.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Dietrich's family raised her to follow the Lutheran religion, but she lost her faith due to battlefront experiences during her time with the US Army as an entertainer, after hearing preachers from both sides invoking God as their support. "I lost my faith during the war and can't believe they are all up there, flying around or sitting at tables, all those I've lost."[tpl]cite book|title=Marlene Dietrich: Life & Legend|author= Steven Bach|publisher= University of Minnesota Press|date= 16 February 2011[/tpl] She once said: "If God exists, he needs to review his plan."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.michaelnugent.com/resources/famous-atheists/dead-atheists-society|title=Dead Atheists Society|publisher=Michaelnugent.com|date=15 September 2010|accessdate=27 September 2010[/tpl]
However, according to her daughter, Maria Riva, Dietrich always traveled with a satchel containing many religious medallions (e.g., St. Christopher, etc.), showing her desire to keep her faith.[tpl]cite web|title=Interview with Maria Riva, Actress and daughter of Marlene Dietrich|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl76pQCX8pg|publisher=Archive of American Television|accessdate=9 June 2013[/tpl]  Also, during her reclusive twilight years in Paris, Dietrich converted to and strongly embraced the faith of Roman Catholicism.
 On 14 May 1992, her funeral ceremony was performed at her favorite Parisian church, La Madeleine.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==Image and legacy==

Dietrich was a fashion icon to the top designers as well as a screen icon that later stars would follow. She once said, "I dress for myself. Not for the image, not for the public, not for the fashion, not for men."[tpl]cite book|last=Auken|first=Sabine|title=I Love this Game|year=2006|publisher=Master Point Press|isbn=978-1897106068|page=12|url=http://books.google.com/?id=C6YwNYvTTv4C&pg=PA12&dq=%22I+dress+for+myself.+Not+for+the+image,+not+for+the+public,+not+for+the+fashion,+not+for+men#v=onepage&q=%22I%20dress%20for%20myself.%20Not%20for%20the%20image%2C%20not%20for%20the%20public%2C%20not%20for%20the%20fashion%2C%20not%20for%20men&f=false[/tpl]  Her public image included openly defying sexual norms, and she was known for her androgynous film roles and her bisexuality.Gammel 2012, p. 373.
A significant volume of academic literature, especially since 1975, analyzes Dietrich's image, as created by the movie industry, within various theoretical frameworks, including that of psycho-analysis. Emphasis is placed, inter alia, on the "fetishistic" manipulation of the female image.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.bookforum.com/inprint/014_03/855 | last=Weber | first=Caroline | title=Academy Award: A new volume analyzes Dietrich in and out of the seminar room | journal=Bookforum | year=2007 | month=September/October/November[/tpl]
In 1992, a plaque was unveiled at Leberstraße 65 in Berlin-Schöneberg, the site of Dietrich's birth. A postage stamp bearing her portrait was issued in Germany on 14 August 1997.
Luxury pen manufacturer MontBlanc produced a limited edition "Marlene Dietrich" pen to commemorate Dietrich's life. It is platinum-plated and has an encrusted deep blue sapphire.
For some Germans, Dietrich remained a controversial figure for having sided with Nazi Germany's foes during the Second World War. In 1996, after some debate, it was decided not to name a street after her in Berlin-Schöneberg, her birthplace.The German-Hollywood Connection: Dietrich's Street[tpl]dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl] However, on 8 November 1997, the central Marlene-Dietrich-Platz was unveiled in Berlin to honor her. The commemoration reads: Berliner Weltstar des Films und des Chansons. Einsatz für Freiheit und Demokratie, für Berlin und Deutschland ("Berlin world star of film and song. Dedication to freedom and democracy, to Berlin and Germany").
Dietrich was made an honorary citizen of Berlin on 16 May 2002.
Translated from German, her memorial plaque reads

The U.S. Government awarded Dietrich the Medal of Freedom for her war work. Dietrich has been quoted as saying this was the honor of which she was most proud in her life. They also awarded her with the Operation Entertainment Medal. The French Government made her a Chevalier (later upgraded to Commandeur) of the Légion d'honneur and a Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Her other awards include the Medallion of Honor of the State of Israel, the Fashion Foundation of America award and a Chevalier de l'Ordre de Leopold (Belgium).[tpl]cite web|title=The Legendary, Lovely Marlene|url=http://www.marlenedietrich.org.uk/id3.html|work=marlenedietrich.org.uk|accessdate=18 May 2013[/tpl]

==Estate==

On 24 October 1993, the largest portion of Dietrich's estate was sold to the Stiftung Deutsche Kinemathek—after U.S. institutions showed no interest—where it became the core of the exhibition at the Filmmuseum Berlin. The collection includes: over 3,000 textile items from the 1920s through the 1990s, including film and stage costumes as well as over a thousand items from Dietrich's personal wardrobe; 15,000 photographs, by Cecil Beaton, Horst P. Horst, George Hurrell, Lord Snowdon, and Edward Steichen; 300,000 pages of documents, including correspondence with Burt Bacharach, Yul Brynner, Maurice Chevalier, Noël Coward, Jean Gabin, Ernest Hemingway, Karl Lagerfeld, Nancy and Ronald Reagan, Erich Maria Remarque, Josef von Sternberg, Orson Welles, and Billy Wilder; as well as other items like film posters and sound recordings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marlene.com/berlin.html|title=Marlene Dietrich: Berlin|accessdate=18 May 2007|work=[/tpl]
