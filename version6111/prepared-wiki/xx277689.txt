==Publishing==

Cohen's first book was Creative Writing for Lawyers, which was published in 1990. The book was intended to draw the natural fictional talents of lawyers, with the idea that legal and fictional writing are compatible genres.[tpl]cite news |title=Lawyer Who Writes Offers Advice to Others Who Might |date=July 8, 1991 |author=Robin Pogrebin |publisher=New York Observer[/tpl] He next authored the book Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Legal Boundaries and Regulatory Perspectives in 1998.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=36160 |title=Whither Goes Alternative Care? |date=July 12, 1999 |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |publisher=Dynamic Chiropractic[/tpl] JAMA Ethics, reviewing the book, wrote that it “transverses the current legal terrain of alternative medicine in the United States” to analyze legal issues such as licensing, malpractice, standard of care, and access to care.[tpl]cite web |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=188134 |page=1633 |title=Law: Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Legal Boundaries and Regulatory Perspectives - Review |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |date=November 11, 1998 |publisher=JAMA Ethics[/tpl]
Cohen then authored the book Beyond Complementary Medicine: Legal and Ethical Perspectives on Health Care and Human Evolution in 2000. Dr. Wayne Jonas reviewed the book in the Journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges stating that, "Cohen poses many of the hard questions that arise at the interfaces of different cultures, beliefs, and goals ... he points out the consequences of applying legal and ethical principles to concepts and assumptions not usually discussed in conventional circles yet used and believed daily by the public."[tpl]cite news |author=Wayne Jonas |publisher=Journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges |title=Beyond Complementary Medicine |date=December 2002[/tpl]
In 2002 Cohen authored the book Future Medicine: Ethical Dilemmas, Regulatory Challenges, and Therapeutic Pathways to Health Care and Healing in Human Transformation. Health Affairs reviewer Dr. Clyde B. Jensen stated that the book, "makes at least three valuable contributions to the integration of conventional and complementary medicine. First ... the book identifies many of the legal and ethical issues that will emerge in the future within complementary and alternative medicine ... Second, it implies that conventional and complementary health care may not be two divergent forms of health care, but rather, similar forms of health care functioning on different parts of a health care continuum. ... Third, it emphasizes the importance of the spirit in healing and health."[tpl]cite news |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/22/3/245.full |author=Clyde B.

Cohen then authored the book Healing at the Borderland of Medicine and Religion in 2006. Dr. Joshua Grossman reviewed the book in the Journal of the National Medical Association, writing that Cohen had provided "the outstanding text that I wished I had available to me years ago" and that navigated the "exquisitely challenging interface between conventional medicine and complementary and alternative medicine with ... skill, caring and concern".[tpl]cite news |page=684 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2574373/pdf/jnma00205-0090b.pdf |publisher=Journal of the National Medical Association |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |date=June 2007 |title=Healing at the Borderland of Medicine and Religion: Review |author=Joshua Grossman[/tpl] That year Cohen also authored a chapter in the book Religion And Psychology: New Research entitled "Some Implications of Integrated Health Care for Religion, Psychology, and the Humanities".[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=UmUl3mhHxJcC&pg=PA39&dq=Michael+H.+Cohen+law&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ViLcUYzXO8nYrQGhxIDIDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Michael%20H.%20Cohen%20law&f=false |title=Religion And Psychology: New Research |editor=Sylvan D.
