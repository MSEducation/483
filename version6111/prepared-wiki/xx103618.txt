[[Papuan Tip languages]]

CATEGORIES: Papuan Tip languages, Languages of Papua New Guinea

The Papuan Tip languages are a branch of the Western Oceanic languages consisting of 60 languages. All Papuan Tip languages, except  Nimoa, Sudest, and the Kilivila languages (all spoken on islands off the coast of mainland Papua New Guinea), have SOV word order due to influences from nearby Papuan languages (Lynch, Ross, & Crowley 2002:104). Universally, this is considered to be a typologically unusual change.

According to Lynch, Ross, & Crowley (2002), the structure of the family is as follows:[tpl]cite book | last = Lynch | first = John | authorlink = John Lynch (linguist) | coauthors = Malcolm Ross; Terry Crowley | year = 2002 | title = The Oceanic languages | location = Richmond, Surrey | publisher = Curzon | isbn = 9780700711284 | oclc = 48929366 [/tpl]
Maisin is difficult to classify, but its Austronesian component likely belongs with Nuclear Papuan Tip.
