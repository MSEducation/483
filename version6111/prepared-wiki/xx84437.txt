3600 Archimedes is a small main belt asteroid, belonging to the Rafita family. It was discovered by Lyudmila Vasil'evna Zhuravleva in 1978 and is named after Archimedes, the ancient Greek scientist. Archimedes was also a famous mathematician who proved that the ratio of a circle's perimeter to its diameter is the same as the ratio of the circle's area to the square of the radius (we nowadays call this ratio Ï€).
