[[Dolby E]]

CATEGORIES: Digital audio, Audio engineering, Dolby Laboratories

Dolby E is an audio encoding and decoding technology developed by Dolby Laboratories that allows 6 to 8 channels of audio to be compressed into an AES-EBU digital audio stream that can be stored as a standard stereo pair of digital audio tracks.
Up to six channels, such as a 5.1 mix, can be recorded as 16 bit Dolby E data. However, if more than channels are required, such as 5.1 plus a stereo LtRt, the AES3 data must be formatted as 20 bit audio.
It is very important to ensure that a Dolby E stream is never played through monitors or headphones without decoding. Undecoded Dolby E data will be converted to analog as full scale (0 dBfs) digital “noise” that can easily damage loudspeakers and/or hearing. Unambiguous media labeling is essential to avoid this.
Dolby E never reaches home viewers as it is intended for use during post-production when moving multichannel material between production facilities and/or broadcasters. It is decoded prior to transmission.
Dolby E encoding and decoding is implemented using commercially available hardware or software.
