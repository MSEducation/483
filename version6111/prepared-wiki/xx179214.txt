After initial reports that Sang was "hacked to death", it later emerged that he was attacked and killed by a stone-throwing gangOlympic athlete stoned to death by Tim Cocks, CourierMail.com.au, January 05, 2008 05:27am in the town of Eldoret on New Year's Day 2008, while on the way to his home at Kimumu, during the violence gripping Kenya in the aftermath of the controversial December 2007 presidential elections. After being struck on the head by a rock, Sang's body was then burnt by the gang, which it is believed, mistook him for a member of a rival tribe. 
That is very unlikely though because he looked disticintly Kalenjin and he would surely have spoken the language.
Other reports say that Sang was killed by his Kikuyu neighbors as he led a group Kalenjin men to attack them. This version was corroborated to ESPN by a Kikuyu man who was one of the attackers as well as a Kalenjin man who had been conscripted to join in the attack.http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=kenya&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines
