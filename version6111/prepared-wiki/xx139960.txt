[[Bati (woreda)]]

CATEGORIES: Amhara Region, Districts of Ethiopia

Bati is one of the woredas in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Part of the Oromia Zone, Bati is bordered on the south by Dawa Harewa, on the southeast by the Argobba special woreda, on the west and north by the Debub Wollo Zone, and on the east by the Afar Region. Towns in this woreda include its administrative center, the market town of Bati. The towns of Degan and Gerba were administratively part of Bati prior to the 2007 census, but were then transferred to Kalu woreda.
A notable landmark of this woreda is the Aneba forest. These 53 hectares of woodland are one of the few remaining stands of Afrocarpus gracilior, an indigenous tree locally known as Zegba, in Ethiopia. At least one tree in this woodland, known as Aliyaw, is 700 years old."Awliyaw: the Largest and Oldest Tree in Ethiopia?" by Dr. Alula Pankhurst (Addis Tribune, last accessed 26 October 2007)
