[[Angina pectoris]]

CATEGORIES: Ischemic heart diseases

Angina pectoris – commonly known as angina – is chest pain often due to ischemia of the heart muscle, due in general to obstruction or spasm of the coronary arteries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/thcp_dorlands_content_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/drlnd/one_04/000004934.htm#000004934 |title=MerckMedicus: Dorland's Medical Dictionary |work= |accessdate=2009-01-09[/tpl] The main cause of angina pectoris is improper contractivity of the heart muscle and coronary artery disease, due to atherosclerosis of the arteries feeding the heart. The term derives from the Latin angina ("infection of the throat") from the Greek ἀγχόνη ankhonē ("strangling"), and the Latin pectus ("chest"), and can, therefore, be translated as "a strangling feeling in the chest".
There is a weak relationship between severity of pain and degree of oxygen deprivation in the heart muscle (i.e., there can be severe pain with little or no risk of a myocardial infarction (commonly known as a heart attack), and a heart attack can occur without pain). In some cases, angina can be extremely serious and has been known to cause death. People who suffer from average to severe cases of angina have an increased percentage of death before the age of 55, usually around 60%.[tpl]Vague|60% of what?|date=October 2013[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
Worsening ("crescendo") angina attacks, sudden-onset angina at rest, and angina lasting more than 15 minutes are symptoms of unstable angina (usually grouped with similar conditions as the acute coronary syndrome). As these may herald myocardial infarction (a heart attack), they require urgent medical attention and are, in general, treated as a presumed heart attack.

==Classification==

===Stable angina===

Also known as effort angina, this refers to the more common understanding of angina related to myocardial ischemia. Typical presentations of stable angina is that of chest discomfort and associated symptoms precipitated by some activity (running, walking, etc.) with minimal or non-existent symptoms at rest or with administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. Symptoms typically abate several minutes following cessation of precipitating activities and recur when activity resumes. In this way, stable angina may be
thought of as being similar to intermittent claudication symptoms.

===Unstable angina===

Unstable angina (UA) (also "crescendo angina"; this is a form of acute coronary syndrome) is defined as angina pectoris that changes or worsens.[tpl]cite web |url=http://merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/thcp_dorlands_content_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/drlnd/one_04/000004949.htm#000004949 |title=MerckMedicus : Dorland's Medical Dictionary |work= |accessdate=2009-01-09[/tpl]
It has at least one of these three features:
UA may occur unpredictably at rest, which may be a serious indicator of an impending heart attack. What differentiates stable angina from unstable angina (other than symptoms) is the pathophysiology of the atherosclerosis. The pathophysiology of unstable angina is the reduction of coronary flow due to transient platelet aggregation on apparently normal endothelium, coronary artery spasms, or coronary thrombosis.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1093/eurheartj/9.suppl_N.40 |title=Pathophysiology of unstable angina pectoris—correlations with coronary angioscopic imaging |year=1988 |last1=Hombach |first1=V. |last2=Höher |first2=M. |last3=Kochs |first3=M. |last4=Eggeling |first4=T. |last5=Schmidt |first5=A. |last6=Höpp |first6=H.

Studies show that 64% of all unstable anginas occur between 10 PM and 8 AM when patients are at rest.[tpl]cite web |publisher=National Heart Lung and Blood Institute |title=What Is Angina? |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/Angina/Angina_SignsAndSymptoms.html[/tpl]
In stable angina, the developing atheroma is protected with a fibrous cap. This cap (atherosclerotic plaque) may rupture in unstable angina, allowing blood clots to precipitate and further decrease the lumen of the coronary vessel. This explains why an unstable angina appears to be independent of activity.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

===Microvascular angina===

Microvascular Angina or Angina Syndrome X is characterized by angina-like chest pain, but the cause is different. The cause of Microvascular Angina is unknown, but it appears to be the result of spasm in the tiny blood vessels of the heart, arms, and legs.Guyton, Arthur. "Textbook of Medical Physiology" 11th edition. Philadelphia; Elsevier, 2006.[tpl]page needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Since microvascular angina is not characterized by arterial blockages, it is harder to recognize and diagnose, but its prognosis is excellent.[ref]

==Signs and symptoms==

Angina pectoris can be quite painful, but many patients with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a pressure, heaviness, tightness, squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, anginal pains may also be experienced in the epigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders.  This is explained by the concept of referred pain, and is due to the fact that the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve's dermatome, without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for referred pain are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating, and nausea in some cases. In this case, the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not angina (such as precordial catch syndrome).
Myocardial ischemia comes about when the myocardia (the heart muscles) receive insufficient blood and oxygen to function normally either because of increased oxygen demand by the myocardia or because of decreased supply to the myocardia. This inadequate perfusion of blood and the resulting reduced delivery of oxygen and nutrients are directly correlated to blocked or narrowed blood vessels.
Some experience "autonomic symptoms" (related to increased activity of the autonomic nervous system) such as nausea, vomiting, and pallor.
Major risk factors for angina include cigarette smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, sedentary lifestyle, and family history of premature heart disease.
A variant form of angina (Prinzmetal's angina) occurs in patients with normal coronary arteries or insignificant atherosclerosis. It is thought to be caused by spasms of the artery. It occurs more in younger women.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sun|first=Hongtao|author2=Mohri, Masahiro|author3= Shimokawa, Hiroaki|author4= Usui, Makoto|author5= Urakami, Lemmy|author6= Takeshita, Akira|title=Coronary microvascular spasm causes myocardial ischemia in patients with vasospastic angina|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|date=28 February 2002|volume=39|issue=5|pages=847–851|doi=10.1016/S0735-1097(02)01690-X|pmid=11869851[/tpl]

One study found that smokers with coronary artery disease had a significantly increased level of sympathetic nerve activity when compared to those without. This is in addition to increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral vascular resistance associated with nicotine, which may lead to recurrent angina attacks.  In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the risk of CHD (Coronary heart disease), stroke, and PVD (Peripheral vascular disease) is reduced within 1–2 years of smoking cessation. In another study, it was found that, after one year, the prevalence of angina in smoking men under 60 after an initial attack was 40% less in those having quit smoking compared to those that continued.  Studies have found that there are short-term and long-term benefits to smoking cessation.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Health Benefits of Cessation |url=http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/quitting/index.htm |date=January 3, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.291.6500.935 |title=Does stopping smoking delay onset of angina after infarction? |year=1985 |last1=Daly |first1=L E |last2=Graham |first2=I M |last3=Hickey |first3=N |last4=Mulcahy |first4=R |journal=BMJ |volume=291 |issue=6500 |pages=935–7 |pmid=3929970 |pmc=1417185[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.287.6388.324 |title=Long term effect on mortality of stopping smoking after unstable angina and myocardial infarction |year=1983 |last1=Daly |first1=L E |last2=Mulcahy |first2=R |last3=Graham |first3=I M |last4=Hickey |first4=N |journal=BMJ |volume=287 |issue=6388 |pages=324–6 |pmid=6409291 |pmc=1548591[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi= 10.1536/ihj.49.261 |title= Cigarette Smoking Augments Sympathetic Nerve Activity in Patients with Coronary Heart Disease |year= 2008 |last1= Shinozaki |first1= Norihiko |last2= Yuasa |first2= Toyoshi |last3= Takata |first3= Shigeo |journal= International Heart Journal |volume= 49 |issue= 3 |pages= 261–72 |pmid= 18612184[/tpl]
