The Statenvertaling (Dutch for States Translation) or Statenbijbel (Dutch for States Bible) is the first Bible translation from the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek languages to the Dutch language, ordered by the government of the Protestant Dutch Republic first published in 1637.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bijbelsdigitaal.nl/statenvertaling-1637/ |title=Statenvertaling (1637) |publisher=Nederlands Bijbel Genootschap BijbelsDigitaal.nl |accessdate=2010-06-04 |language=Dutch[/tpl]
The first complete Dutch Bible was printed in Antwerp in 1526 by Jacob van Liesveldt.Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juhász, Guido Latré (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, ISBN 2-503-51411-1, p. 120. This translation and other existing Dutch Bibles were merely translations of other translations. Furthermore, the translation from Martin Luther was widely used, but it had a Lutheran interpretation. At the Synod of Dort in 1618/19, it was therefore deemed necessary to have a new translation, accurately based on the original languages in imitation of the King James Bible from 1611. The synod requested the States-General of the Netherlands to commission it.
In 1626 the States-General accepted the request from the Synod and the translation started. It was completed in 1635 and authorized by the States-General in 1637. From then until 1657 half-a-million copies were printed. This translation remained authoritative in Protestant churches well into the 20th century.
The source material for the Old Testament of the Statenvertaling was the Masoretic Text. The New Testament was translated from the Textus Receptus.

==Guidelines for translation==

The Statenvertaling was written with specific guidelines for translation established by the Synod during its 8th session on November 20, 1618. The four main instructions to the translators were:Acta, Dordtse Synode, Eighth Session, 20 november 1618.

===Apocryphal books===

Regarding the Biblical apocrypha, the synod decided to translate these books but not to make them part of the canon. They were placed after the books of the New Testament and preceded with a "warning for the reader".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.statenvertaling.net/1637/waarschuwing.html | title = Waarschuwing aan de lezers van de apocriefe boeken, uit de 1637-editie | language = Dutch | accessdate = 2007-11-02 | publisher = Statenvertaling online - bijbel en kunst[/tpl]

===Translation of God's name===

In the Hebrew Bible, God's name is written with the four consonants JHWH (as seen on the very top of the title page in Hebrew characters), and would not be pronounced by the Jews. During the 12th session the synod decided to translate God's name with "HEERE" ("LORD"). In the margin where God's name first appears, the following note is given:NBG Statenvertaling on the Internet, Gen. 1:8 - 2:4

==The translators==

The translators and overseers were appointed during the 13th session on 26 November 1618. Translators were Johannes Bogerman, Willem Baudartius, and Gerson Bucerus for the Old Testament, and Jakobus Rolandus, Herman Faukelius, and Petrus Cornelisz for the New Testament and apocrypha.
Herman Faukelius and Petrus Cornelisz died before they could start on the translation and were therefore replaced by Festus Hommius and Antonius Walaeus.

==Its influence==

Besides its influence in religious matters, the Statenvertaling also had a large effect on the Dutch language and politics. The language, choice of words, and expressions used in the Bible formed the basis of the accepted form of standardized Dutch, which formulated in the 17th century. It acted as a cultural unification of the Netherlands.
Because of its influence, the Statenbijbel has been included in the "Canon of Dutch History". This canon is a list of 50 required subjects which should not be omitted from history classes in the Netherlands.
