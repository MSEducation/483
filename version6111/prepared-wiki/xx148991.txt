==History==

Bloudan is a very ancient village whose history goes back to the Roman era, as is evident by the paintings and carvings found in southern Bloudan. Remains of an ancient Greek Orthodox monastery and the St. George church are also found in the mountains of eastern Bloudan. The historic St. Elias valley is an ancient part of the village, with buildings that are hundreds of years old.
Modern Bloudan, constructed of rendered concrete, has largely replaced the Greek Orthodox and Catholic village built in the 18th and 19th centuries and continues to grow today.Syria & Lebanon (Footprint Travel Guide) 2001:135.
