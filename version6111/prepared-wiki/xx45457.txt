</ref>  As a consequence the surviving population had access to larger tracts of empty farmland and wages increased due to a shortage of labor.  Richer farmers began to acquire land and remove it from communal usage.  An economic recession and low grain prices in fifteenth century England gave a competitive advantage to the production of wool, meat, and milk.  The shift away from grain to livestock accelerated enclosure of fields. The steadily increasing number of formerly open fields converted to enclosed (fenced) fields caused social and economic stress among small farmers who lost their access to communal grazing lands.  Many tenants were forced off the lands their families may have cultivated for centuries to work for wages in towns and cities.  The number of large and middle-sized estates grew in number while small land-holders decreased in number.<ref>Hopcroft, pp 70-81</ref> In the 16th and early 17th centuries, the practice of enclosure (particularly depopulating enclosure) was denounced by the [[Church of England|Church]] and the government, and legislation was drawn up against it.  The dispossession of tenants from their land created an "epidemic of vagrancy" in England in the late 16th and early 17th century<ref>Gies, p. 196; Kulikoff, pp. 19, 50</ref> However, the tide of elite opinion began to turn towards support for enclosure, and the rate of enclosure increased in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<ref> Beresford, Maurice.

==Controversies and inefficiencies==

The open-field system is considered by many economists to have been inefficient for agricultural production and resistant to technological innovation. "Everyone was forced to conform to village norms of cropping, harvesting, and building."Hopcroft, p. 48 The communal institutions, the manorial court, and the tenants regulated agricultural practices and economic behaviour. The manorial lord exercised control over the tenants by extracting rent for land and/or labor to cultivate his demense lands. The scattered holdings of individual farmers increased the time needed to travel to and from fields.
The open-field system, especially its characteristic of common grazing lands, has often been used as an example by economists to illustrate "the tragedy of the commons" and assert that private ownership is a better steward of resources than common or public ownership. "Tragedy of the commons" refers to the alleged destruction of common pastures in England as a result of overgrazing, each tenant maximizing his gain by grazing as many animals as possible and ignoring the long-term impact of overgrazing. However, the creator of the term "tragedy of the commons,"  Garrett Hardin, pointed out that the pastures of England were "protected from ruin by limiting each tenant to a fixed number of animals". Thus, Hardin says the commons were "managed", the "logical equivalent of socialism...which may be good or bad depending on the quality of the management."Hardin, Garrett "The Tragedy of the Commons" http://www.sciencemag.org/content/162/3859/1243.full, accessed 2 August 2013 The fact that the open-field system endured for as much as a thousand years and provided a livelihood to a growing population during that period indicates that the quality of management of the commons was often good.
The replacement of the open-field system by privately owned property was fiercely resisted by many elements of society. The "brave new world" of a harsher, more competitive and capitalistic society from the 16th century onward destroyed the securities and certainties of land tenure of the open-field system.Campbell, Bruch M.S. "The land" in A Social History of England, 1200-1500, ed. by Rosemary Horrox and W. Mark Ormrod. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 237 The system, however, died only slowly.  More than one-half the agricultural land of England was still not enclosed in 1700 after which the government discouraged the continuation of the open-field system. It was finally laid to rest in England about 1850 after more than 5,000 acts of Parliament over several centuries had transformed the "scattered plots in the open fields" into unambiguous private and enclosed properties free of village and communal control and use.McCloskey, Donald N. "The Persistence of English Common Fields" http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/docs/graham/common_fields.pdf, accessed 16 June 2013Other European countries also began to pass legislation to eliminate the scattering of farm land, the Netherlands passing laws making land consolidation compulsory in the 1930s and France until the 1950s.McCloskey, p. 11 In Russia, the open-field system, administered by the obschina / mir (the community of the peasants) remained as the main system of peasant land ownership in Russia until the Stolypin reform process that started in 1905.

==Modern times==

===Surviving open fields===

One place in England where the open-field system continues to be used is the village of Laxton in Nottinghamshire. It is thought that its anomalous survival is due to the inability of two early 19th century landowners to agree on how the land was to be enclosed, thus resulting in the perpetuation of the existing system.
The only other surviving medieval open strip field system in England is located in Braunton, North Devon.  It is still farmed with due regard to its ancient origins and is conserved by those who recognise its importance although the number of owners has fallen dramatically throughout the years and this has resulted in the amalgamation of some of the strips.
There is also a surviving medieval open strip field system in Wales in the township of Laugharne, which is also the last town in the UK with an intact medieval charter.
Vestiges of an open-field system also persist in the Isle of Axholme, North Lincolnshire, around the villages of Haxey, Epworth and Belton, where long strips, of an average size of half an acre, curve to follow the gently sloping ground and are used for growing vegetables or cereal crops. The boundaries are mostly unmarked, although where several strips have been amalgamated a deep furrow is sometimes used to divide them. The ancient village game of Haxey Hood is played in this open landscape.

===Allotment gardens===

A similar system to open fields survives in the United Kingdom as allotment gardens. In many towns and cities there are areas of land of one or two acres (up to about one hectare) interspersed between the buildings. These areas are usually owned by local authorities, or by allotment associations. Small patches of the land are allocated at a low rent to local individuals or families for growing food.
