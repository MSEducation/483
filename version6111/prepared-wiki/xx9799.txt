The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, organized on the basis of their atomic numbers, electron configurations (electron shell model), and recurring chemical properties. Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus). The standard form of the table consists of a grid of elements laid out in 18 columns and 7 rows, with a double row of elements below that. The table can also be deconstructed into four rectangular blocks: the s-block to the left, the p-block to the right, the d-block in the middle, and the f-block below that.
The rows of the table are called periods; the columns are called groups, with some of these having names such as halogens or noble gases. Since, by definition, a periodic table incorporates recurring trends, any such table can be used to derive relationships between the properties of the elements and predict the properties of new, yet to be discovered or synthesized, elements. As a result, a periodic table—whether in the standard form or some other variant—provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior, and such tables are widely used in chemistry and other sciences.
Although precursors exist, Dmitri Mendeleev is generally credited with the publication, in 1869, of the first widely recognized periodic table. He developed his table to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the then-known elements. Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table. Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered. Mendeleev's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behavior.
All elements from atomic numbers 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (ununoctium) have been discovered or reportedly synthesized, with elements 113, 115, 117, and 118 having yet to be confirmed. The first 98 elements exist naturally although some are found only in trace amounts and were synthesized in laboratories before being found in natureThe elements discovered initially by synthesis and later in nature are technetium (Z=43), promethium (61), astatine (85), francium (87), neptunium (93), plutonium (94), americium (95), curium (96), berkelium (97) and californium (98).. Elements with atomic numbers from 99 to 118 have only been synthesized, or claimed to be so, in laboratories. Production of elements having higher atomic numbers is being pursued, with the question of how the periodic table may need to be modified to accommodate any such additions being a matter of ongoing debate. Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories.

==Layout==

All versions of the periodic table include only chemical elements, not mixtures, compounds, or subatomic particles.Some tables include an element zero (i.e. a substance composed purely of neutrons), although this is uncommon. See, for example. Philip Stewart's Chemical Galaxy. Each chemical element has a unique atomic number representing the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have differing numbers of neutrons among different atoms, with these variants being referred to as isotopes. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms have six protons and most have six neutrons as well, but about one per cent have seven neutrons, and a very small fraction have eight neutrons. Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table; they are always grouped together under a single element. Elements with no stable isotopes have the atomic masses of their most stable isotopes, where such masses are shown, listed in parentheses.Greenwood, pp. 24–27
In the standard periodic table, the elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom). A new row (period) is started when a new electron shell has its first electron. Columns (groups) are determined by the electron configuration of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. oxygen and selenium are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.Gray, p. 6
As of 2013, the periodic table has 114 confirmed elements, comprising elements 1 (hydrogen) to 112 (copernicium), 114 (flerovium) and 116 (livermorium). Elements 113, 115, 117 and 118 have reportedly been synthesised in laboratories however none of these claims have been officially confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). As such these elements are currently known only by their systematic element names, based on their atomic numbers.[tpl]cite journal |last=Koppenol |first=W.

A total of 98 elements occur naturally; the remaining 16 elements, from einsteinium to copernicium, and flerovium and livermorium, occur only when synthesised in laboratories. Of the 98 elements that occur naturally, 84 are primordial. The other 14 elements occur only in decay chains of primordial elements.[tpl]cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7[/tpl] No element heavier than einsteinium (element 99) has ever been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form.[tpl]cite book| title = The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements| editor1-last = Morss| editor2-first = Norman M.| editor2-last = Edelstein| editor3-last = Fuger|editor3-first = Jean| last = Haire|first = Richard G.| chapter = Fermium, Mendelevium, Nobelium and Lawrencium| publisher = Springer Science+Business Media| year = 2006| isbn = 1-4020-3555-1| location = Dordrecht, The Netherlands| edition = 3rd| ref = CITEREFHaire2006[/tpl]

==Grouping methods==

===Groups===

A group or family is a vertical column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell.Scerri 2007, p. 24 Consequently, elements in the same group tend to have a shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number.[tpl]cite book |last=Messler|first=R. W.|title=The essence of materials for engineers|year=2010|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, MA|isbn=0-7637-7833-8|page=32[/tpl] However in some parts of the periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.[tpl]Cite book |last=Bagnall|first=K. W.|year=1967|contribution=Recent advances in actinide and lanthanide chemistry|title=Advances in chemistry, Lanthanide/Actinide chemistry|volume=71|pages=1–12|publisher=American Chemical Society|doi=10.1021/ba-1967-0071|editor1-first=PR|editor1-last=Fields|editor2-first=T|editor2-last=Moeller |series=Advances in Chemistry |isbn=0-8412-0072-6 |postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Day|first1=M. C.|last2=Selbin|first2=J.|title=Theoretical inorganic chemistry|year=1969|publisher=Reinhold Book Corporation|edition=2nd|location=New York, MA|isbn=0-7637-7833-8|page=103[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Holman|first1=J.|last2=Hill|first2=G. C.|title=Chemistry in context|year=2000|publisher=Nelson Thornes|edition=5th|location=Walton-on-Thames|isbn=0-17-448276-0|page=40[/tpl]
Under an international naming convention, the groups are numbered numerically from 1 to 18 from the leftmost column (the alkali metals) to the rightmost column (the noble gases).[tpl]cite book |title=Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry: Recommendations 1990|last=Leigh |first=G. J. |year=1990 |publisher=Blackwell Science |isbn=0-632-02494-1[/tpl] Previously, they were known by roman numerals. In America, the roman numerals were followed by either an "A" if the group was in the s- or p-block, or a "B" if the group was in the d-block. The roman numerals used correspond to the last digit of today's naming convention (e.g. the group 4 elements were group IVB, and the group 14 elements was group IVA). In Europe, the lettering was similar, except that "A" was used if the group was before group 10, and "B" was used for groups including and after group 10. In addition, groups 8, 9 and 10 used to be treated as one triple-sized group, known collectively in both notations as group VIII. In 1988, the new IUPAC naming system was put into use, and the old group names were deprecated.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Fluck |first1=E.|year=1988 |title=New Notations in the Periodic Table |journal=Pure Appl. Chem.|volume=60|pages=431–436 |publisher=IUPAC|doi=10.1351/pac198860030431 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1988/pdf/6003x0431.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012 |issue=3 [/tpl]
Some of these groups have been given trivial (unsystematic) names, as seen in the table below, although some are rarely used. Groups 3–10 have no trivial names and are referred to simply by their group numbers or by the name of the first member of their group (such as 'the scandium group' for Group 3), since they display fewer similarities and/or vertical trends.
Elements in the same group tend to show patterns in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because it is easier to remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top to bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus.Moore, p. 111 There are exceptions to these trends, however, an example of which occurs in group 11 where electronegativity increases farther down the group.

===Periods===

A period is a horizontal row in the periodic table. Although groups generally have more significant periodic trends, there are regions where horizontal trends are more significant than vertical group trends, such as the f-block, where the lanthanides and actinides form two substantial horizontal series of elements.[tpl]Cite book|last=Stoker|first=Stephen H.|title=General, organic, and biological chemistry|year=2007|page=68|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=978-0-618-73063-6|oclc=52445586[/tpl]
Elements in the same period show trends in atomic radius, ionization energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus.[tpl]cite book |last=Mascetta |first=Joseph |title=Chemistry The Easy Way |year=2003|publisher=Hauppauge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7641-1978-1 |oclc=52047235|edition=4th |page=50[/tpl] This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases in the same manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.[tpl]cite book |last1=Kotz |first1=John |last2=Treichel |first2=Paul|last3=Townsend |first3=John |title=Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity, Volume 2|edition=7th |year=2009|publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont |isbn=978-0-495-38712-1 |oclc=220756597 |page=324[/tpl]

===Blocks===

The different regions of the periodic table are sometimes referred to as blocks in recognition of the sequence in which the electron shells of the elements are filled. Each block is named according to the subshell in which the "last" electron notionally resides.There is an inconsistency and some irregularities in this convention. Thus, helium is shown in the p-block but is actually an s-block element, and (for example) the d-subshell in the d-block is actually filled by the time group 11 is reached, rather than group 12. The s-block comprises the first two groups (alkali metals and alkaline earth metals) as well as hydrogen and helium. The p-block comprises the last six groups which are groups 13 to 18 in IUPAC (3A to 8A in American) and contains, among other elements, all of the metalloids. The d-block comprises groups 3 to 12 in IUPAC (or 3B to 2B in American group numbering) and contains all of the transition metals. The f-block, usually offset below the rest of the periodic table, comprises the lanthanides and actinides.[tpl]cite book |last=Jones |first=Chris |title=d- and f-block chemistry |year=2002 |publisher=J. Wiley & Sons |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-22476-1|oclc=300468713 |page=2[/tpl]

===Categories===

The elements can be conveniently classified according to their shared physical and chemical properties into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally located to the left and bottom of the periodic table. They are ordinarily shiny, highly conducting solids which form alloys with one another and salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals. Nonmetals are located to the right and top. They are mostly coloured or colourless insulating gases that form covalent compounds with one another. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.[tpl]cite book |last1=Silberberg|first=M. S.|title=Chemistry: The molecular nature of matter and change|year=2006|page=536|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|edition=4th|isbn=0-07-111658-3[/tpl]
Metal and nonmetals can be further classified into similar subcategories that show a left to right gradation in metallic to non-metallic properties. The metals are divided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition metals, and ending in the physically and chemically weak other metals. The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals which, being nearest the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are almost completely inert and nonmetallic. Specialized groupings such as the refractory metals and the noble metals, which are subsets (in this example) of the transition metals, are also known[tpl]cite book |last1=Manson|first1=S. S.|last2=Halford|first2=G. R.|title=Fatigue and durability of structural materials|year=2006|page=376|publisher=ASM International|location=Materials Park, Ohio|isbn=0-87170-825-6[/tpl] and occasionally denoted.[tpl]cite book |last1=Bullinger|first=Hans-Jörg|title=Technology guide: Principles, applications, trends|year=2009|page=8|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-88545-0[/tpl]
Placing the elements into categories and subcategories based on shared properties is imperfect. There is a spectrum of properties within each category and it is not hard to find overlaps at the boundaries, as is the case with most classification schemes.[tpl]cite book |last=Jones|first=B. W.|title=Pluto: Sentinel of the outer solar system|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-19436-5|pages=169–71[/tpl] Beryllium, for example, is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its amphoteric chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or other metal. Radon is classified as a nonmetal and a noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is more characteristic of a metal. Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of the elements into mineralogical occurrence categories, or crystalline structures. Categorising the elements in this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when Hinrichs[tpl]cite journal |last=Hinrichs |first=G. D. |title=On the classification and the atomic weights of the so-called chemical elements, with particular reference to Stas's determinations|journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science |year=1869|volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=112–124[/tpl] wrote that simple boundary lines could be drawn on the periodic table to show elements having like properties, such as the metals and the nonmetals, or the gaseous elements.

===Other conventions and variations===

In presentations of the periodic table, the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table,Gray, p. 11 with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series (either lanthanum or lutetium, and either actinium or lawrencium, respectively) shown in a single cell of the main table, between barium and hafnium, and radium and rutherfordium, respectively. This convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places, as parts of the table's sixth and seventh rows (periods). Some periodic tables include a dividing line, or equivalent, between metals and nonmetals.[tpl]cite book |last=Jespersen|first=N. D.|title=Barron's AP chemistry|year=2010|page=117|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|edition=5 revised|location=Hauppauge, NY|isbn=0-7641-4050-7[/tpl]

==Periodic trends==

===Electron configuration===

The electron configuration or organisation of electrons orbiting neutral atoms shows a recurring pattern or periodicity. The electrons occupy a series of electron shells (numbered shell 1, shell 2, and so on). Each shell consists of one or more subshells (named s, p, d, f and g). As atomic number increases, electrons progressively fill these shells and subshells more or less according to the Madelung rule or energy ordering rule, as shown in the diagram. The electron configuration for neon, for example, is 1s2 2s2 2p6. With an atomic number of ten, neon has two electrons in the first shell, and eight electrons in the second shell—two in the s subshell and six in the p subshell. In periodic table terms, the first time an electron occupies a new shell corresponds to the start of each new period, these positions being occupied by hydrogen and the alkali metals.[tpl]cite book |last=Myers|first=R.|title=The basics of chemistry|year=2003|pages=61–67|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-313-31664-3[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Chang|first=Raymond|title=Chemistry|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|edition=7|isbn=0-07-112072-6|pages=289–310; 340–42[/tpl]
Since the properties of an element are mostly determined by its electron configuration, the properties of the elements likewise show recurring patterns or periodic behaviour, some examples of which are shown in the diagrams below for atomic radii, ionization energy and electron affinity. It is this periodicity of properties, manifestations of which were noticed well before the underlying theory was developed, that led to the establishment of the periodic law (the properties of the elements recur at varying intervals) and the formulation of the first periodic tables.

===Atomic radii===

Atomic radii vary in a predictable and explainable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each period of the table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group. The radius increases sharply between the noble gas at the end of each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory.Greenwood, p. 27
The electrons in the 4f-subshell, which is progressively filled from cerium (Z = 58) to lutetium (Z = 71), are not particularly effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii which are smaller than would be expected and which are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them. Hence hafnium has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as zirconium, and tantalum has an atomic radius similar to niobium, and so forth. This is known as the lanthanide contraction. The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to platinum (Z = 78), after which it is masked by a relativistic effect known as the inert pair effect.Greenwood, p. 28 The d-block contraction, which is a similar effect between the d-block and p-block, is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause.

===Ionization energy===

The first ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove one electron from an atom, the second ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove a second electron from the atom, and so on. For a given atom, successive ionization energies increase with the degree of ionization. For magnesium as an example, the first ionization energy is 738 kJ/mol and the second is 1450 kJ/mol. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires increasingly more energy. Ionization energy becomes greater up and to the right of the periodic table.
Large jumps in the successive molar ionization energies occur when removing an electron from a noble gas (complete electron shell) configuration. For magnesium again, the first two molar ionization energies of magnesium given above correspond to removing the two 3s electrons, and the third ionization energy is a much larger 7730 kJ/mol, for the removal of a 2p electron from the very stable neon-like configuration of Mg2+. Similar jumps occur in the ionization energies of other third-row atoms.

===Electronegativity===

Electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to attract electrons.[tpl]GoldBookRef|file=E01990|title=Electronegativity[/tpl] An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance between the valence electrons and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932.[ref]
