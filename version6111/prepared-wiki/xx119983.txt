==History==

Originally called Draughons Practical Business College and changing its name in 2010, Daymar Institute was founded in 1879 by Professor John F. Draughon of Adams, Tennessee. The first permanent school was established in Nashville, Tennessee around the beginning of the 1900s. The school prospered, and by the time of Draughon's death in 1921, it was a chain of business colleges stretching across the south and western parts of the United States. In 1954, Daymar Institute had earned accreditation by the Accrediting Commission for Business Schools. 
Starting in 1978, Daymar Institute was an accredited junior college of business. After more than 100 years in business, Daymar Institute built a new facility on Plus Park Boulevard in 1980. During the summer of 1987, Daymar Institute expanded with a branch campus in Clarksville, Tennessee. Daymar Institute expanded to a second branch campus during the summer of 2003 in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
