ttcp (test TCP) is a utility program for measuring network throughput, popular on Unix systems. It times the transmission and reception of data between two systems using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) protocols. ttcp command reference 
Created in the 1980s by Mike Muuss and Terry Slattery, ttcp was originally designed for Unix systems but has since been ported to many other systems and can now be used by both Windows and *nix systems alike. History of ttcpJava and C source code

Testing can be done from any platform to any other platform, for example from a Windows machine to a Linux machine, as long as they both have a ttcp application installed. For normal use, ttcp is installed on two machines â€“ one will be the sender, the other the receiver.  The receiver is started first and waits for a connection.  Once the two connect, the sending machine sends data to the receiver and displays the overall throughput of the network they traverse.  The amount of data sent and other options are configurable through a simple command line interface. The output is generally displayed by default in KiB/s (kibiBytes per second) instead of kb/s (kilobits per second), but can be configured to be displayed in other ways on some implementations. The reported throughput is more accurately calculated on the receive side than the transmit side, since the transmit operation may complete before all bytes actually have been transmitted.
