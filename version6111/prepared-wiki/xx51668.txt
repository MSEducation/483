They were formerly in the thrush family Turdidae, but are more often now treated as part of the Old World flycatcher Muscicapidae. The Seychelles Magpie-Robin is one of the most endangered birds in the world, with a population of less than 250, although this is a notable increase from just 16 in 1970.
These are African and Asian garden and forest dwelling species.
