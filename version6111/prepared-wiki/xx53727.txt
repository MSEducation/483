[[Geraniales]]

CATEGORIES: Geraniales, Angiosperm orders

Geraniales are a small order of flowering plants, included within the rosid subgroup of eudicots. The largest family in the order is Geraniaceae with over 800 species. In addition, the order includes some small families, contributing together another less than 40 species. Most Geraniales are herbaceous, but there are also shrubs and small trees.
The economic importance of Geraniales is low. Some species of the genus Pelargonium are cultivated for their aromatic oil used in the perfume industry. Some other species, also mostly Geraniaceae, have horticultural or medicinal uses.
Paleobotanic record is missing.

==Classification==

The family circumscription of the APG III system classification is typical of newer arrangements. In this definition, Hypseocharitaceae is included within Geraniaceae, Francoaceae and Greyiaceae are included within Melianthaceae, and Ledocarpaceae is included within the Vivianiaceae.[tpl]Citation |last=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |year=2009 |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=105â€“121 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122630309/abstract |accessdate=2010-12-10 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x [/tpl]
Under the Cronquist system, the Geraniales had a different composition, comprising the following families:
The Vivianiaceae and Ledocarpaceae were included within the Geraniaceae, and the Hypseocharitaceae within the Oxalidaceae, which are now treated in the order Oxalidales. The Melianthaceae were placed within the Sapindales, the Greyiaceae and Francoaceae within the Rosales, the latter subsumed within the Saxifragaceae.
