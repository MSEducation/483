==Career==

Cornell and Simmons were originally part of The Vernons Girls, and with assistance from the record producer, Phil Swern, formed The Pearls in 1972.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] After her time with the Vernons, Cornell, who had dated Adam Faith, became a solo singer, and had minor success with "Never on a Sunday" and a Christmas song, "The Angel and the Stranger". Cornell's 1960 recording of "Never on Sunday" reached No. 30 in the UK Singles Chart. 
The Pearls' first records were cover versions of the 1960s songs "Third Finger, Left Hand" (a b-side from the Martha and the Vandellas hit single, "Jimmy Mack") and The Ronettes, "You Came, You Saw, You Conquered". These records were issued by Bell Records. However, the vocal on the first single issued by The Pearls was not performed by Cornell and Simmons. It was the duo Sue and Sunny, (Sue (Glover) and Sunny (Leslie)), who sang on "Third Finger Left Hand" as stated on The Pearls compilation album. Sue and Sunny could not front The Pearls when the record was released, because they had previous contractual obligations. There were a total of seven singles issued on the Bell label.
The Pearls' original songs included "Let's Make Love Again", "Doctor Love" and "Wizard of Love" amongst others (although these all failed to chart).  They had more success with "Guilty", co-written by Ron Roker, which became a UK Top 10 success in 1974. Their previously unreleased cover of The Everly Brothers, "Bye Bye Love" appeared on their compilation album, A String of Pearls (see discography).
In 1975 The Pearls changed label to Private Stock releasing three singles over the next two years. The first release "Lead Us Not into Temptation" was an original song but the next two were covers. "The Cheater" was a popular play on the Northern soul circuit, and their last single for Private Stock was a disco version of "I'll See You in My Dreams", which was also issued in the United States as a 10" D.J. single. 
Both Cornell and Simmons were also session and backing singers, as also detailed in the liner notes of their compilation album. They belonged at various stages of their careers to other groups. Cornell who had been a solo singer both prior to joining The Vernons Girls and after, was also a member of The Breakaways, The Ladybirds, The Chucks, The Carefrees and The Raindrops. She also sang and toured with the James Last Orchestra during the entire time she was a member of The Pearls. Simmons, as well as her time with The Vernons Girls, was a member of The Redmond Twins, The Breakaways and The Ladybirds during her career.  
Cornell married session musician Andy White; the drummer on the album version of The Beatles' first hit, "Love Me Do".[tpl]cite web|url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/expats/localhistory/tm_headline=from-pools-girls-to-rock-n-roll-stars%26method=full%26objectid=18018571%26page=5%26siteid=50061-name_page.html |title=Liverpool Echo: Latest Liverpool and Merseyside news, sports and what's on |publisher=Icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk |date=2014-01-24 |accessdate=2014-01-30[/tpl] Cornell and White later divorced and she now lives in London.

===Albums===

The CD in one of a number of errors, lists track 18 as "Pearly", the instrumental B-side of "I'll See You in My Dreams". "Pearly" was credited to 'The Pearls Orchestra'. The track is actually "Let's Make Love Again", which the liner notes said was unobtainable. The other instrumental also not included on the CD, was the B-side of their first single "Third Finger Left Hand", and titled "Little Lady Love Me". This track was credited to 'The Rhythm of the Pearls'. The final two tracks were available on this CD for the first time.
