Condoleezza Rice ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|n|d|ə|ˈ|l|iː|z|ə[/tpl]; born November 14, 1954) is an American political scientist and diplomat. She served as the 66th  United States Secretary of State, and was the second person to hold that office in the administration of President George W. Bush. Rice was the first female African-American secretary of state, as well as the second African American secretary of state (after Colin Powell), and the second female secretary of state (after Madeleine Albright). Rice was President Bush's National Security Advisor during his first term, making her the first woman to serve in that position. Before joining the Bush administration, she was a professor of political science at Stanford University where she served as Provost from 1993 to 1999. Rice also served on the National Security Council as the Soviet and Eastern Europe Affairs Advisor to President George H.W. Bush during the dissolution of the Soviet Union and German reunification.
Following her confirmation as Secretary of State, Rice pioneered the policy of Transformational Diplomacy directed toward expanding the number of responsible democratic governments in the world and especially in the Greater Middle East. That policy faced challenges as Hamas captured a popular majority in Palestinian elections, and influential countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt maintained authoritarian systems with U.S. support. She has logged more miles traveling than any other Secretary of State. While in the position, she chaired the Millennium Challenge Corporation's board of directors.
In March 2009, Rice returned to Stanford University as a political science professor and the Thomas and Barbara Stephenson Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the Hoover Institution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fsi.stanford.edu/people/condoleezzarice/ |title=Condi Rice website at Stanford University |publisher=Fsi.stanford.edu |accessdate=May 27, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Condoleezza Rice |url=http://www.hoover.org/bios/rice.html |title=Condi Rice website at the Hoover Institution |publisher=Hoover.org |accessdate=May 27, 2009[/tpl] In September 2010, Rice became a faculty member of the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a director of its Global Center for Business and the Economy.[tpl]cite web|last=Gloeckler|first=Geoff|title= Getting In Condoleezza Rice To Join Stanford B-School Faculty In September|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/blogs/mba_admissions/archives/2010/08/condoleezza_rice_to_join_stanford_gsb_faculty_in_september.html|work=Business Week|publisher=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=September 15, 2010[/tpl]

==Early life==

Rice was born in Birmingham, Alabama, the only child of Angelena (née Ray) Rice, a high school science, music, and oratory teacher, and John Wesley Rice, Jr., a high school guidance counselor and Presbyterian minister.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Biography |title=Condoleezza Rice |url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ow-Sh/Rice-Condoleezza.html |accessdate=October 26, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/009/1.42.html|title=The Unflappable Condi Rice|accessdate=8 March 2012|date=1 September 2003[/tpl] Her name, Condoleezza, derives from the music-related term, con dolcezza, which in Italian means, "with sweetness". Rice has roots in the American South going back to the pre-Civil War era, and some of her ancestors worked as sharecroppers for a time after emancipation. Rice discovered on the PBS series Finding Your Roots[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/ancestry-testing-goes-for-pinpoint-accuracy-1.10785 |title=Ancestry Testing Goes For Pinpoint Accuracy : Nature News & Comment|work= Nature|date=June 6, 2012[/tpl] that she is of 51% African, 40% European, and 9%  Asian or Native American genetic descent, while her mtDNA is traced back to the Tikar people of Cameroon.[tpl]cite news|work=Your Genetic Genealogist|url=http://www.yourgeneticgenealogist.com/2012/04/finding-your-roots-with-henry-louis_30.html |title=Episode 7: Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr., DNA[/tpl] "Dr. Gates' team also ordered an admixture test for Condoleeza.

===High school and university education===

In 1967, the family moved to Denver, Colorado. She attended St. Mary's Academy, an all-girls Catholic high school in Cherry Hills Village, Colorado, and graduated at age 16 in 1971. After studying piano at the Aspen Music Festival and School, Rice enrolled at the University of Denver, where her father was then serving as an assistant dean.
Rice's initial college major was piano, but after realizing she lacked the talent to play professionally, she began to consider an alternative major.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.du.edu/today/magazine/facing-forward-looking-back|first=Tamara |last=Chapman |title=Facing Forward, Looking Back |work=University of Denver Magazine |date=Summer 2010|accessdate= September 1, 2010[/tpl] She attended an international politics course taught by Josef Korbel, which sparked her interest in the Soviet Union and international relations. Rice later described Korbel (who is the father of Madeleine Albright, then a future U.S. Secretary of State), as a central figure in her life.[tpl]cite news |first=Michael |last=Dobbs |authorlink=Michael Dobbs |title=Josef Korbel's Enduring Foreign Policy Legacy; Professor Mentored Daughter Albright and Student Rice |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-552426.html |work=The Washington Post |date=December 28, 2000 |accessdate=November 2, 2008[/tpl]
In 1974, at age 19, Rice was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Society, and was awarded a B.A., cum laude, in political science by the University of Denver. While at the University of Denver she was a member of Alpha Chi Omega, Gamma Delta chapter.http://www.uscaxo.com/dynamic/?Action=show_custom_content&pageid=1688, additional text. She obtained a master's degree in political science from the University of Notre Dame in 1975. She first worked in the State Department in 1977, during the Carter administration, as an intern in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. She would also study Russian at Moscow State University in the summer of 1979, and intern with the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California. In 1981, at age 26, she received her Ph.D. in political science from the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver. Her dissertation centered on military policy and politics in what was then the communist state of Czechoslovakia.[tpl]cite book |first=Condoleezza |last=Rice |title=The Politics of Client Command: Party-Military Relations in Czechoslovakia, 1948–1975. |series=PhD dissertation |publisher=University of Denver |year=1981 |url=http://130.253.4.23/record=b2587932~S3[/tpl]
From 1980–1981, she was a fellow at Stanford University's Arms Control and Disarmament Program, having won a Ford Foundation Duel Expertise Fellowship in Soviet Studies and International Security. The award granted a year-long fellowship at Harvard, Stanford, Columbia University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology or University of California Los Angeles – Rice contacted both Harvard and Stanford but claims Harvard ignored her. Her fellowship at Stanford began her academic affiliation with the University and time in Northern California.

===Early political views===

Rice was a Democrat until 1982, when she changed her political affiliation to Republican, in part because she disagreed with the foreign policy of Democratic President Jimmy Carter,[tpl]cite web | last = Balz | first = Dan | title = The Republicans Showcase a Rising Star; Foreign Policy Fueled Rice's Party Switch and Her Climb to Prominence | work = Washington Post | date = August 1, 2000 |url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-544048.html | accessdate = April 21, 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Maki |last=Becker |title=20 Things You Probably Didn't Know About |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/04/04/2004-04-04_20_things_you_probably_didn_.html |work=Daily News |date=April 4, 2004 |accessdate=November 2, 2008[/tpl] and because of the influence of her father, who was Republican. As she told the 2000 Republican National Convention, "My father joined our party because the Democrats in Jim Crow Alabama of 1952 would not register him to vote. The Republicans did."[tpl]cite news |first=Rice |last=Condoleezza |title=Text: Condoleezza Rice at the Republican National Convention |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/elections/ricetext080100.htm |work=The Washington Post |date=August 1, 2000 |accessdate=October 27, 2008[/tpl]

==Academic career==

Rice was hired by Stanford University as an assistant professor of political science (1981–1987). She was promoted to associate professor in 1987, a post she held until 1993. She was a specialist on the Soviet Union and gave lectures on the subject for the Berkeley-Stanford joint program led by UC Berkeley Professor George Breslauer in the mid-1980s.
At a 1985 meeting of arms control experts at Stanford, Rice's performance drew the attention of Brent Scowcroft, who had served as National Security Advisor under Gerald Ford.[ref]
