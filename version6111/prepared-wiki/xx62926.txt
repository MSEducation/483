==Personal life==

===Family===

Glass was born in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, to Jewish parents Barry Glass, an accountant, and Shirley Glass, a psychologist, infidelity researcher, and author whom the New York Times called "the godmother of infidelity research".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shirleyglass.com/bio.htm|title=Bio of Dr. Shirley Glass|publisher=Shirleyglass.com|date=|accessdate=February 4, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shirleyglass.com/nytimes.htm|title=Dr. Shirley Glass – Obituary from the New York Times, 10/14/03|publisher=Shirleyglass.com|date=March 1, 1936|accessdate=February 4, 2012[/tpl]
He is the first cousin once removed of composer Philip Glass, who has appeared on Glass's show and whose music can often be heard on the program.
Glass married Anaheed Alani, a writer and editor, in August 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/March-2006/His-American-Life/index.php?cparticle=2&siarticle=1|title=His American Life: A Look at Ira Glass|publisher=http://www.chicagomag.com|accessdate=March 31, 2012[/tpl] "We have the entire Middle East crisis in our house", jokes Glass.

===Religion===

Glass has stated on This American Life that he is a staunch atheist.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/play_full.php?play=394&act=2|title=394: Bait and Switch (Act 2)|publisher=This American Life|date=November 6, 2009|accessdate=May 18, 2011[/tpl] "It's not like I don't feel like I'm a Jew. I feel like I don't have a choice about being a Jew. Your cultural heritage isn't like a suitcase you can lose at the airport. I have no choice about it. It is who I am. I can't choose that. It's a fact of me", Glass begins. "But even when I was 14 or 15, it didn't make that much sense to me that there was this Big Daddy who created the world and would act so crazy in the Old Testament. That we made up these stories to make ourselves feel good and explain the world seems like a much more reasonable explanation. I've tried to believe in God but I simply don't". Glass notes, "We do a lot of stories on Christians and whenever I get close to the people in the story they try to convert me to Christianity". Atheism aside, "some years I have a nostalgic feeling to go into a shul and I'll go in for a High Holiday service", reveals Glass, who has fond memories of his childhood rabbi's enthralling sermons. "Rabbi Seymour Esrog was really funny, a great storyteller. He was so good that even the kids would stay and watch him. He'd tell a funny anecdote, something really moving, and go for a big finish. That's what the show is", he compares, acknowledging the rabbi's influence. Ira Glass has stated that "Christians get a really bad rap in the media" and that contrary to the way they are portrayed in pop-culture, the Christians in his life "were all incredibly wonderful and thoughtful."Ira Glass: Christians Are Horribly Covered by the MediaAtheist Ira Glass Believes Christians Get the Short End of the Media Stick

===Education===

Glass attended Milford Mill High School in Baltimore County where he was active in student theater, student government, and yearbook; he was also the co-editor of the student literary magazine.

A rather popular and outgoing student, Glass was also involved with the morning announcements, as well as being a member of the Milford Mill Honor Society in 1977.[tpl]cite book|title=77 Milestone|year=1977|publisher=Milford Mill High School|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=58, 116, 119, 126, 129, 130, 155, 164[/tpl]

==Career==

===Radio broadcasting===

Glass has worked in public radio for some 30 years. At 19 he began as an intern at National Public Radio's headquarters in Washington, D.C.[tpl]cite journal|title=Ira Glass's Manifesto, Part One|journal=The Transom Review|date=June 1, 2004|volume=4|issue=2|url=http://transom.org/?p=6978|accessdate=December 15, 2011[/tpl] He was a reporter and host on several NPR programs, including Morning Edition, All Things Considered, and Talk of the Nation. Glass wrote,  "The very first National Public Radio show that I worked on was Joe Frank's. I think I was influenced in a huge way... Before I saw Joe put together a show, I had never thought about radio as a place where you could tell a certain kind of story."
From November 1990 until September 1995, he co-hosted, with NPR producer Gary Covino a weekly, local program on Chicago Public Radio called The Wild Room. In 1993, Glass said,  "I like to think of it as the only show on public radio other than Car Talk that both Daniel Schorr news analyst and Kurt Cobain singer/guitarist of Nirvana could listen to. I think it's appropriate that the show aired on Friday evenings is on a station that most people don't listen to at a time when most people won't hear it. And the fact that public radio never puts a new show on the air or takes any off is definitely to our advantage."[tpl]cite web|author=C.K.|url=http://mysore.blogspot.com/2006/02/wrong-o-mary-lou-marcia-froelke.html|title=Wrong-O, Mary Lou|publisher=No Sleep Til Mysore|date=February 22, 2006|accessdate=December 15, 2011[/tpl] 
During this time, he spent two years reporting on the Chicago Public School System—one year at a high school, and another at an elementary school. The largest finding of his investigations was that smaller class sizes would contribute to more success in impoverished, inner-city schools.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bracey|first=Gerald W.|title=Research oozes into practice: the case of class size|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|date=September 1995|volume=77|url=http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5000352169|accessdate=December 15, 2011[/tpl]
In 1995, the MacArthur Foundation approached Torey Malatia, general manager of Chicago Public Radio, with an offer of [tpl]US$|150,000|link=yes[/tpl] to produce a show featuring local Chicago writers and performance artists. Malatia approached Glass who countered that he wanted to do a weekly program with a budget of [tpl]US$|300,000[/tpl]. In 1998 Covino told the Chicago Reader, "The show he proposed was The Wild Room. He just didn't call it The Wild Room."[tpl]cite web|last=Miner|first=Michael|url=http://aan.org/display_story.phtml?ARTICLE_ID=213|title=Ira Glass's Messy Divorce|publisher=Chicago Reader|date=November 20, 1998|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000608065100/|archivedate=December 15, 2011[/tpl] Covino continued to produce The Wild Room until February 1996.
Glass invited David Sedaris to read his essays on NPR, which led to Sedaris's success as an independent author. Glass also produced Sedaris's commentaries on NPR.[tpl]cite journal|last=Carlin|first=Peter Ames|title=Elf-Made Writer|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20123516,00.html|accessdate=December 15, 2011|newspaper=People|date=October 20, 1997|volume=48|number=16[/tpl]
Since 1995, he has hosted and produced This American Life, from WBEZ. The show was nationally syndicated in June 1996 by Public Radio International and has been national ever since. PRI was eager to take on the program, even as NPR passed on it.[tpl]cite news|title=Is PBS Still Necessary|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/arts/television/17mcgr.html|work=New York Times|date=February 17, 2008|accessdate=February 15, 2008|first=Charles|last=McGrath[/tpl]
This American Life reaches over 1.7 million listeners on over 500 stations weekly, with an average listening time of 48 minutes. Glass can be heard in all but four episodes. In July 2013, the 500th show was aired.
On November 17, 2005, This American Life celebrated its 10th anniversary. The following week, as a special show celebrating the anniversary, the first episode, "New Beginnings", was re-broadcast. Prior to this, the first episode had never been aired outside of Chicago. When the first episode was broadcast in 1995, the show was known as Your Radio Playhouse. That first episode includes interviews with talk-show host Joe Franklin and Ira's mother, as well as stories by Kevin Kelly, founding editor of Wired, and performance artist Lawrence Steger.
In May 2009, the This American Life radio show episode "Return to the Scene of the Crime" was broadcast live to over 300 movie theaters.[tpl]cite web|title=Interview on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, May 23, 2008|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/20990/late-night-with-conan-obrien-fri-may-23-2008 (see segment at 30:00)|publisher=hulu|date=|accessdate=February 29, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080528060009/http://www.hulu.com/watch/20990/late-night-with-conan-obrien-fri-may-23-2008 |archivedate=May 28, 2008[/tpl]
In 2009, Glass was named the recipient of the Edward R.

In 2011 Ira Glass earned the George Polk Award in Radio Reporting for "Very Tough Love", an hour-long report that showed alarmingly severe punishments being meted out by a county drug court judge in Georgia. Drug courts were set up to emphasize rehabilitation instead of incarceration, but Glass' investigation revealed that Judge Amanda Williams strayed far from the principles and philosophy by routinely piling on jail sentences for relapses. One 17-year-old girl, initially in trouble for forging two small checks on her father's account, was facing more than 10 years in jail. Following the airing of "Very Tough Love", Georgia's Judicial Qualifying Commission filed 14 ethical misconduct charges against Williams. Within weeks of the filing of charges, Williams stepped down from the bench and agreed never to seek other judicial offices.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liu.edu/About/News/Univ-Ctr-PR/2012/February/Polk-PR_Feb-20-2012.aspx|title=LIU Announces 2011 George Polk Awards in Journalism|publisher=Long Island University|date=February 20, 2012|accessdate=February 25, 2012[/tpl]

On March 22, 2007, Glass and company began airing a television version of This American Life as half-hour episodes on the Showtime network. During an interview with Patt Morrison on 89.3 KPCC, Southern California Public Radio, Glass said that he lost [tpl]convert|30|lb|kg[/tpl] for this venture.[tpl]cite web|title=Patt Morrison for March 22, 2007|work=Patt Morrison|publisher=KPCC|url=http://www.scpr.org/programs/patt-morrison/2007/03/22/|date=March 22, 2007|accessdate=May 13, 2010 [/tpl] The show aired for thirteen episodes over two seasons, and ended in 2009 because of the heavy workload required to produce it.[tpl]cite web|last=Kaufmann|first=Justin|title=Ira Glass dishes on end of TAL TV.
