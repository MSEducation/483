A Cocksucking Cowboy (also known as a Cowboy and Butterball) is a layered shooter made from one part cold Butterscotch Schnapps with two parts of Baileys Irish Cream,Cocksucking Cowboy shooter recipe making it 32 proof (16% ABV). The Baileys is poured off the back of a bar spoon so it "floats" on top of the schnapps in a shot glass. Some alternative recipes reverse the proportions, specifying 2 parts Schnapps to 1 part Irish cream.Cocksucking Cowboy recipe
The drink is also known as a Buttery Nipple or Slippery Nipple #4, though the Buttery Nipple is often thought to be composed of [tpl]frac|1|2[/tpl] Butterscotch and [tpl]frac|1|2[/tpl] Irish Cream. Note that Baileys does not have to be used; any type of Irish Cream will do.
In 2004, it was an extremely popular shooting drink in Australian pubs and clubs and could be purchased prepared in segmented shot glasses sealed with foil.  Kits with bottles of each liqueur are also sold, both under the name "CS Cowboy".
On the movie The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations, Sam Reide (Chris Carmack) is seductively offered a "buttery nipple" by the bartender Vicki (Melissa Jones).
