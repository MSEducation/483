Zru'a ([tpl]lang-he-n|זְרוּעָה[/tpl], lit. Sown) is a religious moshav in southern Israel. Located near Netivot and the Gaza Strip, it falls under the jurisdiction of Sdot Negev Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 242.
The village was established in 1953 by immigrants from Morocco. Its name is taken from the Book of Jeremiah 2:2;
 Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith the LORD: I remember for thee the affection of thy youth, the love of thine espousals; how thou wentest after Me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.
