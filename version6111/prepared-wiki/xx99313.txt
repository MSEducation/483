==Career==

Koyasu is part of the voice actor quartet Weiß  consisting of Weiß Kreuz voice castmates Shinichiro Miki, Tomokazu Seki, and Yuuki Hiro. He used to work for Production Baobab but is now the head of T's Factory, a voice actor company he founded in 1998.
Koyasu is known for his deep, smooth voice, which often lands him in roles that are either villains or lonely bishōnen. Recently, though (as in the cases of Mitsurugi Hanagata from Saber Marionette J, Ryo Kuroyanagi from Yakitate!! Japan, Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, and Kei Itoshiki from Zoku Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei) he has been voicing more and more lively/humorous characters. According to Hisaya Nakajo, the manga artist of the series Hana-Kimi, the character of Masao Himejima was designed with Koyasu's voice in mind; the voice actor ended up voicing this character in the series' drama CDs.
According to the Anime News Network, as winter of 2013, Koyasu is the most prolific voice actor, with 482 voice credits to his name.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Koyasu is also the creator of the Weiß series, and has authored the manga Weiß Side B. In creating Weiß Kreuz, Koyasu was inspired by an old Japanese series called Sure Death.
Koyasu often voices under the pseudonym Hayato Jumonji, especially in H anime.
He also narrates promotional videos and pre-flight safety videos for StarFlyer.
In 18 September 2009, he created Velvet Underworld series which is the first drama CD of the series, “The Fool”. In the following month, “The Wheel of Fortune” had released as the second drama CD of the series. He called and made the crew of the drama himself. This is said to be another pick of his career after Weiß.
