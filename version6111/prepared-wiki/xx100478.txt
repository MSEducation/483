Postum is a powdered roasted-grain beverage once popular as a coffee substitute. The caffeine-free beverage was created by Postum Cereal Company founder C. W. Post in 1895 and marketed as a healthful alternative to coffee.[tpl]r|pendergrast2010[/tpl][tpl]rp|93[/tpl] The Postum Cereal Company eventually became General Foods, which was bought by Kraft Foods. Post was a student of John Harvey Kellogg, who believed that caffeine was unhealthy. 
The "instant" drink mix version was developed in 1912, replacing the original brewed beverage.[tpl]citation |editor-first= R.J. |editor-last= Clarke |editor2-first= R. |editor2-last= Macrae |year= 1987 |title= Coffee (Volume 5): Related Beverages |publisher= Springer |isbn= 9781851661039 |pages= 98–99 [/tpl] Postum is made from wheat bran, wheat, molasses, and maltodextrin from corn. This 10‑calorie beverage was caffeine-free, fat-free, trans-fat-free, sodium-free, and kosher. In addition to the original flavor, there was a coffee-flavored version.

Postum quickly became popular, making Post wealthy. The aggressive advertising, with the mysterious slogan "There's a Reason", warned against coffee and caffeine's alleged dangers, and promoted the benefits of Postum. When imitations appeared, the company introduced a cheaper drink, Monk's Brew, identical to Postum, then discontinued it after competitors left the market. Instant Postum appeared in 1911.[tpl]r|pendergrast2010[/tpl][tpl]rp|93-98[/tpl]
