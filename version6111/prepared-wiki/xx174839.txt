[[2-Phenylhexane]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrocarbons

2-Phenylhexane is an aromatic hydrocarbon. It can be produced by a Friedel-Crafts alkylation between 1-chlorohexane and benzene.,Organic Chemistry Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell (Google books) or by the reaction of benzene and 1-hexene with various acid catalysts such as antimony pentafluoride,Zhurnal Organicheskoi Khimii, 17(7), 1505-11; 1981 scandium(III) triflate,[tpl]Cite journal | title = Scandium(III) triflate immobilised in ionic liquids: a novel and recyclable catalytic system for Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aromatic compounds with alkenes | author = Choong Eui Song; Woo Ho Shimb; Eun Joo Roha; Jung Hoon Choi | journal = Chem.
