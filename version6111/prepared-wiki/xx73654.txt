Lamont Herbert Dozier (born June 16, 1941) is an American songwriter and record producer, born in Detroit, Michigan. Dozier has co-written and produced many US Billboard #1 hits.

==Career==

Dozier is best known as a member of Holland–Dozier–Holland, the songwriting and production team responsible for much of the Motown sound and numerous hit records by artists such as Martha and the Vandellas, The Supremes, The Four Tops, and The Isley Brothers. Along with Brian Holland, Dozier served as the team's musical arranger and producer, whilst Eddie Holland concentrated mainly on lyrics and vocal production.

==Early days==

Dozier recorded a few unsuccessful records for various Detroit labels before the trio started working together as a writing and production team for Motown in 1962. They first made their mark the following year with Martha and The Vandellas' early hits, including "Come And Get These Memories" (#6 R&B), "Heatwave" (#1 R&B, #4 pop), and "Quicksand" (#8 pop). In 1964, "Where Did Our Love Go" became the first of ten #1 pop hits which Holland–Dozier–Holland would write and produce for the Supremes over the next three years or so.
After Holland–Dozier–Holland left Motown in 1968 to form the Invictus/Hot Wax labels, Dozier began recording as an artist on their labels. The most successful song was "Why Can't We Be Lovers" (#9 Billboard R&B). Dozier departed from H-D-H in the mid-1970s and was replaced by new arranger/producer Harold Beatty.

==Performer==

Dozier went on to record a number of albums as a performer in his own right, also writing much of the material.  The 1977 album, Peddlin' Music On The Side (Warner Bros. Records) contained the epic "Going Back to My Roots," which was later recorded by Odyssey. The earlier "Black Bach" (ABC Records) featured the country-flavored "All Cried Out" (#4 R&B, #26 pop). He had his biggest hit with 1974's "Trying to Hold On to My Woman (ABC), which reached #15 pop, #4 R&B. In 1981, he scored a beach music hit with "Cool Me Out."

==Composer==

Dozier had another #1 hit as a songwriter in the 1980s, joining with Phil Collins to write the song "Two Hearts" for the movie soundtrack for Buster. "Two Hearts" received a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, tying with "Let the River Run" from Working Girl by Carly Simon, an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song and a Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television. Collins and Dozier also co-wrote "Loco in Acapulco" for The Four Tops, which is also featured on the Buster Soundtrack.
In 1984, Essex-born singer Alison Moyet scored a U.S.Top 40 hit with the Dozier-penned "Invisible." Three years later, Dozier cowrote "Infidelity" and "Suffer" with Simply Red frontman Mick Hucknall for the British pop-soul band's second album, Men and Women. In 1989, they teamed up again to write "You've Got It" and "Turn It Up" for Simply Red's follow-up LP, A New Flame.
It wasn't until 2004 that Dozier chose to revisit his catalog of Motown hits, rather than recording only new material. His album Reflections Of..., that he released that year revealed Dozier's new arrangements frequently providing an interesting counterpoint to the upbeat pop sound of the 1960s originals.
