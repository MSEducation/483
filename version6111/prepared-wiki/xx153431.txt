Discrepancy of hypergraphs is an area of discrepancy theory.

==Hypergraph discrepancies in two colors==

These notions as well as the term 'discrepancy' seem to have appeared for the first time in a paper of Beck.J. Beck: "Roth's estimate of the discrepancy of integer sequences is nearly sharp", page 319-325. Combinatorica, 1, 1981 Earlier results on this problem include the famous lower bound on the discrepancy of arithmetic progressions by RothK. F. Roth: "Remark concerning integer sequences", pages 257–260. Acta Arithmetica 9, 1964 and upper bounds for this problem and other results by Erdős and SpencerJ. Spencer: "A remark on coloring integers", pages 43–44. Canad. Math. Bull. 15, 1972.P. Erdős and J. Spencer: "Imbalances in k-colorations", pages 379–385. Networks 1, 1972. and Sárközi (described on p. 39 P. Erdős and J. Spencer: "Probabilistic Methods in Combinatorics." Akadémia Kiadó, Budapest, 1974.). At that time, discrepancy problems were called quasi-Ramsey problems.
To get some intuition for this concept, let's have a look at a few examples.
The last example shows that we cannot expect to determine the discrepancy by looking at a single parameter like the number of hyperedges. Still, the size of the hypergraph yields first upper bounds.

with n the number of vertices and m the number of edges.
The proof is a simple application of the probabilistic method:
To prove this, a much more sophisticated approach using the entropy function was necessary.
