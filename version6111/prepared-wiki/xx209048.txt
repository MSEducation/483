==Crimes==

Payne's career as a jewel thief spans six decades, with a criminal record dating back to 1952. Her modus operandi is to enter jewelry stores posing as a well-to-do woman, typically looking for a diamond ring. Using her charm, she would engage the clerk, asking to see an assortment of items. Eventually, she would "cause the clerk to forget" just how many items were outside the case, and at some point, she would leave with one or two pieces.
Her crimes have spanned five decades. She has been arrested many times; she is a career criminal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/10/31/83-year-old-jewel-thief-arrested-again/UPI-28831383255794/ |title=Doris Marie Payne, 83-year-old jewel thief arrested in CA |publisher=UPI.com |date=2013-10-31 |accessdate=2013-11-06[/tpl]Wagner, Angie "75-year-old jewel thief looks back" Nov 20, 2005.
