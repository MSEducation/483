==Career==

===Norwich City===

Eagle was a product of the Norwich City's youth system and made his first team debut on September 19, 2006 when he started Norwich's League Cup tie with league one outfit Rotherham United in which he helped Norwich to a 4–2 victory. He went on to make 10 league appearances before the end of the 2006–07 season season. Eagle did not feature under manager Glenn Roeder in the 2007–08 season, but was awarded a new one-year contract in the summer of 2008. However, in April 2009 he was released by the club.

===Inverness Caledonian Thistle===

In July 2009, Eagle joined Inverness Caledonian Thistle on trial, and played in a pre-season friendly against Highland League side Buckie Thistle. Eagle supplied the cross for Richie Foran to head the first goal in a 2–0 win for Caley. Eagle went on to play for Inverness during the 2009–2010 season. The song by Haircut 100, 'Love Plus One,' was sung regularly by the Inverness crowd as a way of showing their appreciation to Eagle, whose hair they were very fond of.

===Grimsby Town===

In July 2010, Eagle joined Football League One side Leyton Orient on trial, and then moved on to Grimsby Town.http://www.grimsby-townfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10417~2106962,00.html After a successful trial period with The Mariners, he signed for the club on a two year deal on 5 August 2010. He scored his first goal against Forest Green Rovers going on to score another to help Town to a 3–3 draw.http://www.grimsby-townfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10417~2112293,00.html Eagle went on to bag himself some tremendous goals, including a strike from inside the centre circle in the 6-1 away win at Histon, soon making him a favourite at Blundell Park. The goal brought Eagle to the attention of a number of said to be big clubs from the continent but a move abroad never materialised. Following the sacking of manager Neil Woods in February 2010, Eagle began to fall out of contention at Grimsby following the appointment on joint managers Rob Scott and Paul Hurst. On 23 November 2011 he signed on loan with fellow Conference National side Alfreton Town.BBC Sport - Alfreton Town sign Rob Eagle from Grimsby Town
