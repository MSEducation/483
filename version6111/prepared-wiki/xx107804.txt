Charles Augustus Doyen (3 September 1859 â€“ 6 October 1918) was an officer in the United States Marine Corps with the rank of Brigadier general and the first recipient of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.

==Biography==

Born in Concord, New Hampshire, BGen. Doyen was a member of the Naval Academy class of 1881, later commissioned second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. He organized and commanded the 5th Marine Regiment in World War I, and in France took command of the 4th Brigade, 2d Division, composed of the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments and the 6th Gun Battalion.  From 26 October to 8 November 1917, he served as Commanding General, US 2d Division(RA), the first Marine officer to command a US Army division. His devoted service broke his health, and he was forced to return to the United States, where he died on 6 October 1918. But the 4th Brigade went on to win a historic victory in Belleau Wood. BGen. Doyen's contribution to these victories was recognized by the posthumous award of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the first to ever be awarded.
