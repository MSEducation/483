==Farm and garden bonfires==

Bonfires are used on farms, in large gardens and allotments to dispose of waste plant material that is not readily composted. This includes woody material, pernicious weeds, diseased material and material treated with persistent pesticides and herbicides. Such bonfires may be quite small but are often designed to burn slowly for several days so that wet and green material may be reduced to ash by frequently turning the unburnt material into the centre. Such bonfires can also deal with turf and other earthy material. The ash from garden bonfires is a useful source of potash and may be beneficial in improving the soil structure of some soils although such fires must be managed with safety in mind.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.safegardening.co.uk/BonfireSafety.html |title=Bonfire safety |publisher=Safegardening.co.uk |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2010-09-13[/tpl] Garden and farm bonfires are frequently smoky and can cause local nuisance if poorly managed or lit in unsuitable weather conditions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk/neighbourhood-nuisance/garden-bonfires/ |title=What's wrong with Bonfires? |publisher=Environmental-protection.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13[/tpl]
