Charles Babbage, FRS (26 December 1791 – 18 October 1871) was an English polymath.[tpl]cite book|author=Terence Whalen|title=Edgar Allan Poe and the masses: the political economy of literature in antebellum America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=slR0DNOxT00C&pg=PA254|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00199-9|page=254[/tpl] He was a mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, who is best remembered now for originating the concept of a programmable computer.
Considered a "father of the computer",[tpl]cite book | author=Halacy, Daniel Stephen | title = Charles Babbage, Father of the Computer | year = 1970 | publisher=Crowell-Collier Press | isbn = 0-02-741370-5 [/tpl] Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex designs. His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as "pre-eminent" among the many polymaths of his century.
Parts of Babbage's uncompleted mechanisms are on display in the London Science Museum. In 1991, a perfectly functioning difference engine was constructed from Babbage's original plans. Built to tolerances achievable in the 19th century, the success of the finished engine indicated that Babbage's machine would have worked.

==Early life==

Babbage's birthplace is disputed, but according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography he was most likely born at 44 Crosby Row, Walworth Road, London, England.[tpl]cite ODNB|id=962|title=Babbage, Charles|first=Doron|last=Swade[/tpl] A blue plaque on the junction of Larcom Street and Walworth Road commemorates the event.[tpl]openplaque | 1140 [/tpl]
His date of birth was given in his obituary in The Times as 26 December 1792; but then a nephew wrote to say that Babbage was born one year earlier, in 1791. The parish register of St. Mary's Newington, London, shows that Babbage was baptised on 6 January 1792, supporting a birth year of 1791.[tpl]harvnb|Hyman|1982|p=5[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Moseley | first = Maboth | title = Irascible Genius, The Life of Charles Babbage | publisher=Henry Regnery | location = Chicago | year = 1964 | page = 29 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ELAMAQAAIAAJ |ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = The Late Mr. Charles Babbage, F.R.S |work=The Times |location=UK [/tpl]
Babbage was one of four children of Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Teape. His father was a banking partner of William Praed in founding Praed's & Co. of Fleet Street, London, in 1801.Praed, William (1747–1833), of Tyringham, Bucks. and Trevethoe, nr. St. Ives, Cornw. In 1808, the Babbage family moved into the old Rowdens house in East Teignmouth. Around the age of eight Babbage was sent to a country school in Alphington near Exeter to recover from a life-threatening fever. For a short time he attended King Edward VI Grammar School in Totnes, South Devon, but his health forced him back to private tutors for a time.[tpl]harvnb|Moseley|1964|p=39[/tpl]
Babbage then joined the 30-student Holmwood academy, in Baker Street, Enfield, Middlesex, under the Reverend Stephen Freeman. The academy had a library that prompted Babbage's love of mathematics. He studied with two more private tutors after leaving the academy. The first was a clergyman near Cambridge; through him Babbage encountered Charles Simeon and his evangelical followers, but the tuition was not what he needed.[tpl]cite book|author=Anthony Hyman|title=Charles Babbage: Pioneer Of The Computer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YCddaWqWK2cC&pg=PA17|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 January 1985|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02377-9|page=17[/tpl] He was brought home, to study at the Totnes school: this was at age 16 or 17.[tpl]cite book|author1=Bruce Collier|author2=James MacLachlan|title=Charles Babbage: And the Engines of Perfection|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-vzMEwf-bHEC&pg=PA11|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=28 September 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514287-7|page=11[/tpl] The second was an Oxford tutor, under whom Babbage reached a level in Classics sufficient to be accepted by Cambridge.

==At the University of Cambridge==

Babbage arrived at Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1810.[tpl]acad | id = BBG810C | name = Babbage, Charles [/tpl] He was already self-taught in some parts of contemporary mathematics;[tpl]cite book|author=E. S. Leedham-Green|title=A Concise History of the University of Cambridge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xvScOaG7mHYC&pg=PA142|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=26 September 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43978-7|pages=142–[/tpl] he had read in Robert Woodhouse, Joseph Louis Lagrange, and Marie Agnesi. As a result he was disappointed in the standard mathematical instruction available at Cambridge.
Babbage, John Herschel, George Peacock, and several other friends formed the Analytical Society in 1812; they were also close to Edward Ryan.Wilkes (2002) p.355 As a student, Babbage was also a member of other societies such as The Ghost Club, concerned with investigating supernatural phenomena, and the Extractors Club, dedicated to liberating its members from the madhouse, should any be committed to one.[tpl]cite book | last = Hofstadter | first = Douglas R. | authorlink = Douglas Hofstadter | title = Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid | publisher=Penguin Books | date = 1979, 2000 | page = 726 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Charles Babbage'S Computer Engines | url = http://www.allsands.com/history/objects/history/objects/babbagecomputer_yy_gn.htm | accessdate =13 March 2012 [/tpl]
In 1812 Babbage transferred to Peterhouse, Cambridge. He was the top mathematician there, but did not graduate with honours. He instead received a degree without examination in 1814. He had defended a thesis that was considered blasphemous in the preliminary public disputation; but it is not known whether this fact is related to his not sitting the examination.

==After Cambridge==

Considering only his reputation, Babbage quickly made progress. He lectured to the Royal Institution on astronomy in 1815, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1816.[tpl]cite book |author=James Essinger |title=Jacquard's Web |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-280578-2 |page=59 and 98[/tpl] After graduation, on the other hand, he applied for positions unsuccessfully, and had little in the way of career. In 1816 he was a candidate for a teaching job at Haileybury College; he had recommendations from James Ivory and John Playfair, but lost out to Henry Walter.[tpl]cite book|author1=Raymond Flood|author2=Adrian Rice|author3=Robin Wilson|title=Mathematics in Victorian Britain|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QmzfJUShGYUC&pg=PA145|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=29 September 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-960139-4|page=145[/tpl] In 1819, Babbage and Herschel visited Paris and the Society of Arcueil, meeting leading French mathematicians and physicists.[tpl]cite book|title=George Green: Mathematician and Physicist, 1793–1841: The Background to His Life and Work|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x2Y2eb9IzwwC&pg=PA255|accessdate=8 May 2013|year=2001|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-0-89871-463-0|page=255 note 19[/tpl] That year Babbage applied to be professor at the University of Edinburgh, with the recommendation of Pierre Simon Laplace; the post went to William Wallace.[tpl]cite book|author=Roger Hahn|title=Pierre Simon Laplace: 1749 – 1827; a Determined Scientist|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ROu0P-pYQekC&pg=PA295|accessdate=8 May 2013|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01892-1|pages=295 note 34[/tpl][tpl]cite ODNB|id=28545|title=Wallace, William|first=Maria|last=Panteki[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The Edinburgh magazine, and literary miscellany, a new series of The Scots magazine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4NsEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA369|accessdate=8 May 2013|year=1819|page=369[/tpl]
With Herschel, Babbage worked on the electrodynamics of Arago's rotations, publishing in 1825. Their explanations were only transitional, being picked up and broadened by Michael Faraday. The phenomena are now part of the theory of eddy currents, and Babbage and Herschel missed some of the clues to unification of electromagnetic theory, staying close to Ampère's force law.[tpl]cite book |author=L. Pearce Williams |title=Michael Faraday |year=1965 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-80299-7 |pages=170–2[/tpl]
Babbage purchased the actuarial tables of George Barrett, who died in 1821 leaving unpublished work, and surveyed the field in 1826 in Comparative View of the Various Institutions for the Assurance of Lives.[tpl]cite ODNB|id=1523|title=Barrett, George|first=Robert|last=Brown[/tpl] This interest followed a project to set up an insurance company, prompted by Francis Baily and mooted in 1824, but not carried out.[tpl]cite book|author1=Bruce Collier|author2=James MacLachlan|title=Charles Babbage: And the Engines of Perfection|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-vzMEwf-bHEC&pg=PA29|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=28 September 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514287-7|pages=29–30[/tpl] Babbage did calculate actuarial tables for that scheme, using Equitable Society mortality data from 1762 onwards.[tpl]cite book|author=Anthony Hyman|title=Charles Babbage: Pioneer Of The Computer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YCddaWqWK2cC&pg=PA59|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 January 1985|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02377-9|page=59[/tpl]
During this whole period Babbage depended awkwardly on his father's support, given his father's attitude to his early marriage, of 1814: he and Edward Ryan wedded the Whitmore sisters. He made a home in Marylebone in London, and founded a large family.[tpl]cite book|author=James|title=Remarkable Engineers|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0bwb5bevubwC&pg=PA45|accessdate=26 April 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-48625-5|page=45[/tpl] On his father's death in 1827, Babbage inherited a large estate (value around £100,000), making him independently wealthy. After his wife's death in the same year he spent time travelling. In Italy he met Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, foreshadowing a later visit to Piedmont. In April 1828 he was in Rome, and relying on Herschel to manage the difference engine project, when he heard that he had become professor at Cambridge, a position he had three times failed to obtain (in 1820, 1823 and 1826).[tpl]cite book|author=Kevin C.

===Astronomical Society===

Babbage was instrumental in founding the Astronomical Society in 1820.  Its initial aims were to reduce astronomical calculations to a more standard form, and to circulate data.[tpl]cite book|author=Martin Campbell-Kelly|title=The History of Mathematical Tables: From Sumer to Spreadsheets|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=O170gWPZ7M8C&pg=PA8|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=2 October 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-850841-0|page=8[/tpl] These directions were closely connected with Babbage's ideas on computation, and in 1824 he won its Gold Medal, cited "for his invention of an engine for calculating mathematical and astronomical tables".
Babbage's motivation to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation has been a commonplace since Dionysius Lardner wrote about it in 1834 in the Edinburgh Review (under Babbage's guidance).[tpl]cite book|author1=Raymond Flood|author2=Adrian Rice|author3=Robin Wilson|title=Mathematics in Victorian Britain|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YruifIx88AQC&pg=PA34|accessdate=26 April 2013|date=29 September 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-162794-1|page=34[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Harro Maas|title=William Stanley Jevons and the Making of Modern Economics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aGWvA6SiWfMC&pg=PA201|accessdate=27 April 2013|date=4 April 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82712-6|page=201[/tpl] The context of these developments is still debated. Babbage's own account of the origin of the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Society's wish to improve The Nautical Almanac. Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project, to recalculate some part of those tables. With the results to hand, discrepancies were found. This was in 1821 or 1822, and was the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation.[tpl]cite book|author=M. Norton Wise|title=The values of precision|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g8uvNtuPhgUC&pg=PA320|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=17 March 1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-01601-6|page=320[/tpl] The issue of the Nautical Almanac is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by attitudes to Sir Joseph Banks, who had died in 1820.[tpl]cite book|author1=Eleanor Robson|author2=Jacqueline Stedall|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Mathematics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HIMiWHVKLDkC&pg=RA1-PR34|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=18 December 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-160744-8|page=xxxiv[/tpl]
Babbage studied the requirements to establish a modern postal system, with his friend Thomas Frederick Colby, concluding there should be a uniform rate that was put into effect with the introduction of the Uniform Fourpenny Post supplanted by the Uniform Penny Post[tpl]cite book|author=Anthony Hyman|title=Charles Babbage: Pioneer Of The Computer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YCddaWqWK2cC&pg=PA115|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 January 1985|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02377-9|page=115[/tpl] in 1839 and 1840.

===British Lagrangian School===

The Analytical Society had initially been no more than an undergraduate provocation. During this period it had some more substantial achievements. In 1816 Babbage, Herschel and Peacock published a translation from French of the lectures of Sylvestre Lacroix, which was then the state-of-the-art calculus textbook.[tpl]cite book|title=Constructing a Bridge: An Exploration of Engineering Culture, Design, and Research in Nineteenth-century France and America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6P66Ofj6DiYC&pg=PA110|accessdate=26 April 2013|year=1997|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-11217-8|page=110[/tpl]
Reference to Lagrange in calculus terms marks out the application of what are now called formal power series. British mathematicians had used them from about 1730 to 1760. As re-introduced, they were not simply applied as notations in differential calculus. They opened up the fields of functional equations (including the difference equations fundamental to the difference engine) and operator (D-module) methods for differential equations.  The analogy of difference and differential equations was notationally changing Δ to D, as a "finite" difference becomes "infinitesimal". These symbolic directions became popular, as operational calculus, and pushed to the point of diminishing returns. The Cauchy concept of limit was kept at bay.[tpl]cite book|author=Niccolò Guicciardini|title=The Development of Newtonian Calculus in Britain, 1700–1800|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nIKVQCeI1FUC&pg=PA138|accessdate=26 April 2013|date=13 November 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52484-1|page=138[/tpl] Woodhouse had already founded this second "British Lagrangian School" with its treatment of Taylor series as formal.[tpl]cite book|author1=Dov M. Gabbay|author2=John Woods|title=British Logic in the Nineteenth Century|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UULl07dutBwC&pg=PA403|accessdate=26 April 2013|date=10 March 2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-055701-4|pages=403–4[/tpl]
In this context function composition is complicated to express, because the chain rule is not simply applied to second and higher derivatives. This matter was known to Woodhouse by 1803, who took from Louis François Antoine Arbogast what is now called Faà di Bruno's formula (a misnomer). In essence it was known to Abraham De Moivre (1697). Herschel found the method impressive, Babbage knew of it, and it was later noted by Lovelace as compatible with the analytical engine.Craik pp. 122–3. In the period to 1820 Babbage worked intensively on functional equations in general, and resisted both conventional finite differences and Arbogast's approach (in which Δ and D were related by the simple additive case of the exponential map). But via Herschel he was influenced by Arbogast's ideas in the matter of iteration, i.e. composing a function with itself, possibly many times. Writing in a major paper on functional equations in the Philosophical Transactions (1815/6), Babbage said his starting point was work of Gaspard Monge.[tpl]cite book|author1=Jeremy J.

==Academic==

From 1828 to 1839 Babbage was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge. Not a conventional resident don, and inattentive to teaching, he wrote three topical books during this period of his life. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832.[tpl]cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 April 2011[/tpl] Babbage was out of sympathy with colleagues: George Biddell Airy, his predecessor as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge,George Biddell Airy#Biography thought an issue should be made of his lack of interest in lecturing. Babbage planned to lecture in 1831 on political economy. Babbage's reforming direction looked to see university education more inclusive, universities doing more for research, a broader syllabus and more interest in applications; but William Whewell found the programme unacceptable. A controversy Babbage had with Richard Jones lasted for six years.[tpl]cite book|author=Kevin C.

It was during this period that Babbage tried to enter politics. Simon Schaffer writes that his views of the 1830s included disestablishment of the Church of England, a broader political franchise, and inclusion of manufacturers as stakeholders.[tpl]cite book|author=Kevin C.

In 1832 he came in third among five candidates, missing out by some 500 votes in the two-member constituency when two other reformist candidates, Thomas Wakley and Christopher Temple, split the vote.historyofparliamentonline.org, Middlesex County 1820–1832.[tpl]cite book|author=Sylvanus Urban|title=The Gentleman's Magazine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AbYUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA659|accessdate=25 April 2013|year=1838|page=659[/tpl] In his memoirs Babbage related how this election brought him the friendship of Samuel Rogers: his brother Henry Rogers wished to support Babbage again, but died within days.[tpl]cite book|author=Charles Babbage|title=Passages from the life of a philosopher|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2T0AAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA190|accessdate=1 May 2013|year=1864|publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, & Green|pages=190–1[/tpl] In 1834 Babbage finished last among four.[tpl]cite book | author=Crowther, J.

==="Declinarians", learned societies and the BAAS===

Babbage now emerged as a polemicist. One of his biographers notes that all his books contain a "campaigning element". His Reflections on the Decline of Science and some of its Causes (1830) stands out, however, for its sharp attacks. It aimed to improve British science, and more particularly to oust Davies Gilbert as President of the Royal Society, which Babbage wished to reform.[tpl]cite book|author=Anthony Hyman|title=Charles Babbage: Pioneer Of The Computer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YCddaWqWK2cC&pg=PA88|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=1 January 1985|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02377-9|page=88[/tpl] It was written out of pique, when Babbage hoped to become the junior secretary of the Royal Society, as Herschel was the senior, but failed because of his antagonism to Humphry Davy.[tpl]cite book|author=James|title=Remarkable Engineers|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0bwb5bevubwC&pg=PA47|accessdate=27 April 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-48625-5|page=47[/tpl] Michael Faraday had a reply written, by Gerrit Moll, as On the Alleged Decline of Science in England (1831).[tpl]cite book |author=Richard Holmes|title=The Age of Wonder|year=2008 |publisher=Pantheon Books |isbn=978-0-375-42222-5 |pages=437–40[/tpl] On the front of the Royal Society Babbage had no impact, with the bland election of the Duke of Sussex to succeed Gilbert the same year. As a broad manifesto, on the other hand, his Decline led promptly to the formation in 1831 of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS).
The Mechanics' Magazine in 1831 identified as Declinarians the followers of Babbage. In an unsympathetic tone it pointed out David Brewster writing in the Quarterly Review as another leader; with the barb that both Babbage and Brewster had received public money.[tpl]cite book|title=The Mechanics' Magazine, Museum, Register, Journal, and Gazette|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7tQ3AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA373|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=1831|publisher=M. Salmon|pages=373–4[/tpl]
In the debate of the period on statistics (qua data collection) and what is now statistical inference, the BAAS in its Statistical Section (which owed something also to Whewell) opted for data collection. This Section was the sixth, established in 1833 with Babbage as chairman and John Elliot Drinkwater as secretary. The foundation of the Statistical Society followed.[tpl]cite book|author=Mary Poovey|title=A History of the Modern Fact: Problems of Knowledge in the Sciences of Wealth and Society|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AQ5ADoAjmd4C&pg=PA309|accessdate=26 April 2013|date=15 November 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-67526-8|page=309[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=Dov M.

===On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures===

Babbage published On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures (1832), on the organisation of industrial production. It was an influential early work of operational research.[tpl]ThoemmesBritish19C|Babbage, Charles|39[/tpl] John Rennie the Younger in addressing the Institute of Civil Engineers on manufacturing in 1846 mentioned mostly surveys in encyclopaedias, and Babbage's book was first an article in the Encyclopædia Metropolitana, the form in which Rennie noted it, in the company of related works by John Farey, Jr., Peter Barlow and Andrew Ure.[tpl]cite book|author=Charles Manby|title=Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institute of Civil Engineers|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zBMFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA57|accessdate=26 April 2013|year=1846|page=57[/tpl] From An essay on the general principles which regulate the application of machinery to manufactures and the mechanical arts (1827), which became the Encyclopædia Metropolitana article of 1829, Babbage developed the schematic classification of machines that, combined with discussion of factories, made up the first part of the book. The second part considered the "domestic and political economy" of manufactures.[tpl]cite book|author1=M.

The book sold well, and quickly went to a fourth edition (1836).[tpl]cite book|author=Mauro F.

It was not, in its first edition, intended to address deeper questions of political economy; the second (late 1832) did, with three further chapters including one on piece rate.[tpl]cite book|author=Maxine Berg|title=The Machinery Question and the Making of Political Economy 1815–1848|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=azk7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA181|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=4 February 1982|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-28759-3|page=181[/tpl] The book also contained ideas on rational design in factories, and profit sharing.[tpl]cite book|author=Bruce E.

===="Babbage principle"====

In Economy of Machinery was described what is now called the "Babbage principle". It pointed out commercial advantages available with more careful division of labour. As Babbage himself noted, it had already appeared in the work of Melchiorre Gioia in 1815.[tpl]cite book|author1=Julio Segura|author2=Carlos Rodríguez Braun|title=An Eponymous Dictionary of Economics: A Guide To Laws And Theorems Named After Economists|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z6Oy4L-6LSwC&pg=PA13|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-360-5|page=13[/tpl] The term was introduced in 1974 by Harry Braverman.[tpl]cite book|title=Work|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0332ru3Rx0sC&pg=PA39|accessdate=27 April 2013|date=30 December 2011|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-4678-7|page=39[/tpl] Related formulations are the "principle of multiples" of Philip Sargant Florence, and the "balance of processes".[tpl]cite book|author=P.

What Babbage remarked is that skilled workers typically spend parts of their time performing tasks that are below their skill level. If the labour process can be divided among several workers, labour costs may be cut by assigning only high-skill tasks to high-cost workers, restricting other tasks to lower-paid workers.[tpl]cite book|author1=Giddens, Anthony|author2=Held, David|title=Classes, Power and Conflict: Classical and Contemporary Debates|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4cT7xzRMCLUC&pg=PA155|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1982|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04627-6|page=155[/tpl] He also pointed out that training or apprenticeship can be taken as fixed costs; but that returns to scale are available by his approach of standardisation of tasks, therefore again favouring the factory system.[tpl]cite book|author=Guang-Zhen Sun|title=Readings in the Economics of the Division of Labor: The classical tradition|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Y16MEasCqicC&pg=PA10|accessdate=26 April 2013|year=2005|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-270-127-5|page=10[/tpl] His view of human capital was restricted to minimising the time period for recovery of training costs.[tpl]cite book|author1=Pere Mir Artigues|author2=Josep Gonza ́lez Calvet|title=Funds, Flows and Time: An Alternative Approach to the Microeconomic Analysis of Productive Activities|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=s1n1LWVyTWoC&pg=PA72|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-71291-6|page=72 note 15[/tpl]

====Publishing====

Another aspect of the work was its detailed breakdown of the cost structure of book publishing. Babbage took the unpopular line, from the publishers' perspective, of exposing the trade's profitability.[tpl]cite book|author=James A.

George Holyoake saw Babbage's detailed discussion of profit sharing as substantive, in the tradition of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier, if requiring the attentions of a benevolent captain of industry, and ignored at the time.George Jacob Holyoake, The History of Co-operation in England: its literature and its advocates, vol. 2 (1879) pp. 228–32; archive.org.

===Natural theology===

In 1837, responding to the series of eight Bridgewater Treatises, Babbage published his Ninth Bridgewater Treatise, under the title On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation. In this work Babbage weighed in on the side of uniformitarianism in a current debate.[tpl]cite book|title=Genesis and Geology: A Study in the Relations of Scientific Thought, Natural Theology, and Social Opinion in Great Britain, 1790–1850|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PKERMZkA9A0C&pg=PA247|accessdate=19 April 2013|year=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-34481-5|page=247[/tpl] He preferred the conception of creation in which natural law dominated, removing the need for "contrivance".[tpl]cite book|author=John G.

Babbage put forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator. He could make laws which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ad hoc miracles each time a new species was required. In Vestiges the parallel with Babbage's computing machines is made explicit, as allowing plausibility to the theory that transmutation of species could be pre-programmed.[tpl]cite book|author=Robert Chambers|title=Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation and Other Evolutionary Writings|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nqyVl1ji7SAC&pg=PR16|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=15 August 1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10073-9|pages=xvi–xvii[/tpl]
Babbage has been seen as influenced by Indian thought, in particular Indian logic; one possible route would be through Henry Thomas Colebrooke.[tpl]cite book|author=Dr Jonar Ganeri|title=Indian Logic: A Reader|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t_nOiqFmxOIC&pg=PA7|accessdate=19 April 2013|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7007-1329-5|page=7[/tpl] Mary Everest Boole claims that Babbage was introduced to Indian thought in the 1820s by her uncle George Everest:
 Some time about 1825, Everest came to England for two or three years, and made a fast and lifelong friendship with Herschel and with Babbage, who was then quite young. I would ask any fair-minded mathematician to read Babbage's Ninth Bridgewater Treatise and compare it with the works of his contemporaries in England; and then ask himself whence came the peculiar conception of the nature of miracle which underlies Babbage's ideas of Singular Points on Curves (Chap, viii) – from European Theology or Hindu Metaphysic? Oh! how the English clergy of that day hated Babbage's book![tpl]cite book |author=Boole, Mary Everest |chapter=Indian Thought and Western Science in the Nineteenth Century |editor=Cobham, E.M.; Dummer, E.S. |title=Boole, Mary Everest "Collected Works" |publisher=Daniel |location=London |year=1931 |pages=947–967 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=-5wyxULAKpsC[/tpl] 

==Later life==

The British Association was consciously modelled on the Deutsche Naturforscher-Versammlung, founded in 1822.[tpl]cite book|author1=Andrew Ede|author2=Lesley B.

He wanted to go faster in the same directions, and had little time for the more gentlemanly component of its membership. Indeed, he subscribed to a version of conjectural history that placed industrial society as the culmination of human development (and shared this view with Herschel). A clash with Roderick Murchison led in 1838 to his withdrawal from further involvement.[tpl]cite book|title=Discovering Water: James Watt, Henry Cavendish, and the Nineteenth Century 'Water Controversy'|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=orL4QRlvBfYC&pg=PA136|accessdate=1 May 2013|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3177-4|pages=136–7[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Iwan Rhys Morus|title=Bodies/Machines|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HCSJaqeyrHIC&pg=PA44|accessdate=8 May 2013|date=1 December 2002|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-85973-695-1|page=44[/tpl] At the end of the same year he sent in his resignation as Lucasian professor, walking away also from the Cambridge struggle with Whewell.

===Metrology programme===

A project announced by Babbage was to tabulate all physical constants (referred to as "constants of nature", a phrase in itself a neologism), and then to compile an encyclopaedic work of numerical information. He was a pioneer in the field of "absolute measurement".[tpl]cite book|author=Mario Biagioli|title=The Science studies reader|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=i4iS5_AtZUkC&pg=PA459|accessdate=1 May 2013|year=1999|publisher=Routledge, Chapman & Hall, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-415-91868-8|pages=459–60[/tpl] His ideas followed on from those of Johann Christian Poggendorff, and were mentioned to Brewster in 1832. There were to be 19 categories of constants, and Ian Hacking sees these as reflecting in part Babbage's "eccentric enthusiasms".[tpl]cite book|author=Ian Hacking|title=The Taming of Chance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ud7EzIBwQBwC&pg=PA55|accessdate=1 May 2013|date=31 August 1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-38884-9|pages=55–60[/tpl] Babbage's paper On Tables of the Constants of Nature and Art was reprinted by the Smithsonian Institution in 1856, with an added note that the physical tables of Arnold Henry Guyot "will form a part of the important work proposed in this article".[tpl]cite book|title=Report of the Board of Regents|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bc4rAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA289|accessdate=1 May 2013|year=1857|publisher=The Institution|pages=289–302[/tpl]
Exact measurement was also key to the development of machine tools. Here again Babbage is considered a pioneer, with Henry Maudslay, William Sellers, and Joseph Whitworth.[tpl]cite book|author=David F Noble|title=America by Design: Science, Technology, and the Rise of Corporate Capitalism David F.

===Cryptography===

Babbage achieved notable results in cryptography, though this was still not known a century after his death. Letter frequency was category 18 of Babbage's tabulation project. Joseph Henry later defended interest in it, in the absence of the facts, as relevant to the management of movable type.
During the Crimean War of the 1850s, Babbage broke Vigenère's autokey cipher as well as the much weaker cipher that is called Vigenère cipher today.[tpl]cite book|title=Introduction to Cryptography: With Mathematical Foundations in Computer Implementations|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=34cE8KzUwLgC&pg=PA187|accessdate=19 April 2013|year=2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-1763-6|page=187[/tpl] His discovery was kept a military secret, and was not published.

===Public nuisances===

Babbage involved himself in well-publicised but unpopular campaigns against public nuisances. He once counted all the broken panes of glass of a factory, publishing in 1857 a "Table of the Relative Frequency of the Causes of Breakage of Plate Glass Windows": Of 464 broken panes, 14 were caused by "drunken men, women or boys".[tpl]cite journal | title = Table of the Relative Frequency of Occurrence of the Causes of Breaking of Plate Glass Windows | author=Babbage, Charles | journal=Mechanics Magazine | year = 1857 | volume = 66 | page = 82 [/tpl][tpl]cite book | author=Babbage, Charles | title = The Works of Charles Babbage | volume = V | year = 1989 | publisher=William Pickering | location = London | page = 137 | editor = Martin Campbell-Kelly | isbn = 1-85196-005-8 [/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cScKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA417|title=The Insurance cyclopaedia |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=22 February 2011|year=1878[/tpl]
Babbage's distaste for commoners ("the Mob") included writing "Observations of Street Nuisances" in 1864, as well as tallying up 165 "nuisances" over a period of 80 days. He especially hated street music, and in particular the music of organ grinders, against whom he railed in various venues.

In the 1860s, Babbage also took up the anti-hoop-rolling campaign. He blamed hoop-rolling boys for driving their iron hoops under horses' legs, with the result that the rider is thrown and very often the horse breaks a leg.[tpl]harvnb|Babbage|1864|p=360[/tpl] Babbage achieved a certain notoriety in this matter, being denounced in debate in Commons in 1864 for "commencing a crusade against the popular game of tip-cat and the trundling of hoops."Hansard's parliamentary debates.

==Death==

Babbage lived and worked for over 40 years at 1 Dorset Street, Marylebone, where he died, at the age of 79, on 18 October 1871; he was buried in London's Kensal Green Cemetery. According to Horsley, Babbage died "of renal inadequacy, secondary to cystitis."[tpl]cite journal | authorlink=Victor Horsley | last =Horsley | first= Victor | title = Description of the Brain of Mr. Charles Babbage, F.R.S | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | year = 1909 | volume = 200 | pages = 117–32 | url = http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/xl7210623532p738/?p=daaddfe06dca444eafad36aab95177ea&pi=1 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1909.0003 | accessdate =7 December 2007 | issue=262–273 [/tpl] Subscription required.

==Computing pioneer==

Babbage's machines were among the first mechanical computers. That they were not actually completed was largely because of funding problems and personality issues.
Babbage directed the building of some steam-powered machines that achieved some modest success, suggesting that calculations could be mechanised. For more than ten years he received government funding for his project, which amounted to £17,000, but eventually the Treasury lost confidence in him.[tpl]cite book |author=Gleick, J. |title=The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood |publisher=Fourth Estate |location=London |year=2011 |page=104 [/tpl]
While Babbage's machines were mechanical and unwieldy, their basic architecture was similar to a modern computer. The data and program memory were separated, operation was instruction-based, the control unit could make conditional jumps, and the machine had a separate I/O unit.

===Background on mathematical tables===

In Babbage's time, printed mathematical tables were calculated by human computers, in other words by hand. They were central to navigation, science and engineering, as well as mathematics. Mistakes were known to occur in transcription as well as calculation.
At Cambridge, Babbage saw the fallibility of this process, and the opportunity of adding mechanisation into its management. His own account of his path towards mechanical computation references a particular occasion:
 In 1812 he was sitting in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea occurred to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.B. V. Bowden, Faster than Thought, Pitman (1953), p. 8. 
There was another period, seven years later, when his interest was aroused by the issues around computation of mathematical tables. The French official initiative by Gaspard de Prony, and its problems of implementation, were familiar to him. After the Napoleonic Wars came to a close, scientific contacts were renewed on the level of personal contact: in 1819 Charles Blagden was in Paris looking into the printing of the stalled de Prony project, and lobbying for the support of the Royal Society. In works of the 1820s and 1830s, Babbage referred in detail to de Prony's project.[tpl]cite book|author=Martin Campbell-Kelly|title=The History of Mathematical Tables: From Sumer to Spreadsheets|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=O170gWPZ7M8C&pg=PA110|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=2 October 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-850841-0|page=110[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Charles Coulston Gillispie|title=Science and Polity in France: The End of the Old Regime|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EPgIpRIvaSAC&pg=PA485|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=10 January 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2461-8|page=485[/tpl]

===Difference engine===

Babbage began in 1822 with what he called the difference engine, made to compute values of polynomial functions. It was created to calculate a series of values automatically. By using the method of finite differences, it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division.
For a prototype difference engine, Babbage brought in Joseph Clement to implement the design, in 1823. Clement worked to high standards, but his machine tools were particularly elaborate. Under the standard terms of business of the time, he could charge for their construction, and would also own them. He and Babbage fell out over costs around 1831.[tpl]cite ODNB|id=37291|title=Clement, Joseph|first=Anita|last=McConnell[/tpl]
Some parts of the prototype survive in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford.[tpl]Cite journal | first = Denis | last = Roegel | title = Prototype Fragments from Babbage's First Difference Engine | journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | volume = 31 | pages = 70–5 | date = April–June 2009 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1109/MAHC.2009.31 | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl] This prototype evolved into the "first difference engine." It remained unfinished and the finished portion is located at the Science Museum in London. This first difference engine would have been composed of around 25,000 parts, weigh fifteen tons (13,600 kg), and would have been [tpl]Convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=on[/tpl] tall. Although Babbage received ample funding for the project, it was never completed. He later (1847–1849) produced detailed drawings for an improved version,"Difference Engine No. 2", but did not receive funding from the British government. His design was finally constructed in 1989–1991, using his plans and 19th century manufacturing tolerances. It performed its first calculation at the London Science Museum, returning results to 31 digits.
Nine years later, the Science Museum completed the printer Babbage had designed for the difference engine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/710950.stm |title=SCI/TECH | Babbage printer finally runs |publisher=BBC News |date=13 April 2000 |accessdate=27 April 2012[/tpl]

====Completed models====

The London Science Museum has constructed two Difference Engines according to Babbage's plans for the Difference Engine No 2. One is owned by the museum. The other, owned by the technology multimillionaire Nathan Myhrvold, went on exhibition at the Computer History Museum[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/ | title = Overview – The Babbage Engine | publisher=Computer History Museum | accessdate =29 January 2009 [/tpl] in Mountain View, California on 10 May 2008.[tpl]cite news | last = Shiels | first = Maggie | title = Victorian 'supercomputer' is reborn | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7391593.stm | accessdate =11 May 2008 |work=BBC News  | date = 10 May 2008 [/tpl] The two models that have been constructed are not replicas; Myhrvold's engine is the first design by Babbage, and the London Science Museum's is a later model.

===Analytical Engine===

After the attempt at making the first difference engine fell through, Babbage worked to design a more complex machine called the Analytical Engine. He hired C. G. Jarvis, who had previously worked for Clement as a draughtsman.[tpl]cite book|author1=Bruce Collier|author2=James MacLachlan|title=Charles Babbage: And the Engines of Perfection|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-vzMEwf-bHEC&pg=PA65|accessdate=20 April 2013|date=28 September 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514287-7|page=65[/tpl] The Analytical Engine marks the transition from mechanised arithmetic to fully-fledged general purpose computation. It is largely on it that Babbage's standing as computer pioneer rests.[tpl]cite web|title=The Baggage Engine|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/|publisher=Computer History Museum|accessdate=6 March 2013[/tpl]
The major innovation was that the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using punched cards: the Engine was intended to use loops of Jacquard's punched cards to control a mechanical calculator, which could use as input the results of preceding computations.[tpl]cite book|last=Ceruzzi|first=Paul|title=Computing: A Concise History|year=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|location=United States|isbn=9780262517676|pages=7–8[/tpl] The machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers, including sequential control, branching and looping. It would have been the first mechanical device to be, in principle, Turing-complete. The Engine was not a single physical machine, but rather a succession of designs that Babbage tinkered with until his death in 1871.

===Ada Lovelace and Italian followers===

Babbage had no research team. Ada Lovelace corresponded with him during his development of the Analytical Engine. She is credited with developing an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers. Although there is disagreement over how much of the ideas were Lovelace's own, she is often described as the first computer programmer.[tpl]cite journal | author=Fuegi J, Francis J | title = Lovelace & Babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes' | journal=Annals of the History of Computing | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 16–26 | date = October–December 2003 | doi = 10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887 [/tpl] See pages 19, 25 She also translated and wrote literature supporting the project. Babbage visited Turin in 1840 at the invitation of Giovanni Plana. In 1842 Charles Wheatstone approached Lovelace to translate a paper of Luigi Menabrea, who had taken notes of Babbage's Turin talks; and Babbage asked her to add something of her own. Fortunato Prandi who acted as interpreter in Turin was an Italian exile and follower of Giuseppe Mazzini.[tpl]cite book |author=Benjamin Woolley |title=The Bride of Science |year=1999 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-333-72436-4 |pages=258–60, 338[/tpl]

===Swedish followers===

Per Georg Scheutz wrote about the difference engine in 1830, and experimented in automated computation. After 1834 and Lardner's Edinburgh Review article he set up a project of his own, doubting whether Babbage's initial plan could be carried out. This he pushed through with his son, Edvard Scheutz.[tpl]cite book|author=Michael Lingren|title=Glory and Failure: The Difference Engines of Johann Müller, Charles Babbage and Georg and Edvard Scheutz|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=plgMl2yfVkwC&pg=PA98|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=1990|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-12146-0|pages=98–112[/tpl] Another Swedish engine was that of Martin Wiberg (1860).[tpl]cite book|author=I.

===Legacy===

In 2011, researchers in Britain embarked on a multimillion-pound project, "Plan 28", to construct Babbage's Analytical Engine.  Since Babbage's plans were continually being refined and were never completed, they will engage the public in the project and crowd-source the analysis of what should be built.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/science/computer-experts-building-1830s-babbage-analytical-engine.html?_r=1/ | title = It Started Digital Wheels Turning | publisher=New York Times | accessdate =10 November 2011 [/tpl] It would have the equivalent of 675 bytes of memory, and run at a clock speed of about 7 Hz.  They hope to complete it by the 150th anniversary of Babbage's death, in 2021.
Advances in MEMs and nanotechnology have led to recent high-tech experiments in mechanical computation. The benefits suggested include operation in high radiation or high temperature environments.[tpl]cite web | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WVI/is_1999_Oct_11/ai_56912203/print | title = Electronics Times: Micro-machines are fit for space | publisher=Findarticles.com | date = 11 October 1999 | accessdate =29 January 2009 [/tpl] These modern versions of mechanical computation were highlighted in The Economist in its special "end of the millennium" black cover issue in an article entitled "Babbage's Last Laugh".[tpl]cite news |author= |title=Babbage's Last Laugh |agency= |work= |newspaper=The Economist |pages= |page= |date=9 September 1999 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/324654?story_id=E1_PNQGVQ[/tpl]

==Family==

On 25 July 1814, Babbage married Georgiana Whitmore at St. Michael's Church in Teignmouth, Devon; her sister Louisa married Edward Ryan. The couple lived at Dudmaston Hall,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.visitbritain.co.uk/Attraction/Bridgnorth/Historic-House-or-Palace/157092/Dudmaston-Hall.htm | title = Attraction information for Dudmaston Hall | publisher=VisitBritain | accessdate =29 January 2009 [/tpl] Shropshire (where Babbage engineered the central heating system), before moving to 5 Devonshire Street, Portland Place, London.
Charles and Georgiana had eight children,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bavidge.co.uk/Babbage%20Family%20Tree%202005,%20InternetTree/wc03/wc03_074.htm | title = Babbage Family Tree 2005 | author=Valerie Bavidge-Richardson | accessdate = 9 February 2013 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013194355/http://bavidge.co.uk/Babbage%20Family%20Tree%202005,%20InternetTree/wc03/wc03_074.htm | archivedate = 13 October 2007 [/tpl]  Also see [tpl]cite web | url = http://clanbarker.com/getperson.php?personID=I2894&tree=Br | title = Charles Babbage entry | publisher = ClanBarker | accessdate = 9 February 2013[/tpl] but only four – Benjamin Herschel, Georgiana Whitmore, Dugald Bromhead and Henry Prevost – survived childhood. Charles' wife Georgiana died in Worcester on 1 September 1827, the same year as his father, their second son (also named Charles) and their newborn son Alexander.
His youngest son, Henry Prevost Babbage (1824–1918), went on to create six working difference engines based on his father's designs,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/henrybabbage/ | title = Henry Prevost Babbage – The Babbage Engine | publisher=Computer History Museum | accessdate =29 January 2009 [/tpl] one of which was sent to Harvard University where it was later discovered by Howard H.
