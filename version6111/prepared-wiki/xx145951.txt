[[Arietids]]

CATEGORIES: Meteor showers, June events

The Arietids are a strong meteor shower that lasts from May 22 to July 2 each year, and peaks on June 7. The Arietids, along with the Zeta Perseids, are the most intense daylight meteor showers of the year.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast06jun_1m.htm|title=June's Invisible Meteors|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2000|author=NASA[/tpl] The source of the shower is unknown, but scientists suspect that they come from the asteroid 1566 Icarus,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.spaceweather.com/meteors/arietids.html|title=Daylight Meteors: The Arietids|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=spaceweather.com|author=spaceweather.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070927225531/http://www.spaceweather.com/meteors/arietids.html| archivedate= 27 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] although the orbit also corresponds similarly to 96P/Machholz.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200310/000020031003A0165629.php|title=On the Association among Periodic Comet 96P/Machholz, Arietids, the Marsden Comet Group, and the Kracht Comet Group.|first=Katsuhito|last=Ohtsuka|author2=Nakano, Syuichi|author3= Yohikawa, Makoto|date=Feb 2003|publisher=Science Links Japan|accessdate=2008-08-06[/tpl]
First discovered at Jodrell Bank Observatory in England during the summer of 1947, the showers are caused when the Earth passes through a dense portion of two interplanetary meteoroid streams, producing an average of 60 shooting stars each hour, that originate in the sky from the constellation Aries and the constellation Perseus.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://meteorshowersonline.com/showers/daytime_arietids.html|title=Arietids|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Meteor Showers Online|author=Meteor Showers Online| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070927220347/http://meteorshowersonline.com/showers/daytime_arietids.html| archivedate= 27 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] However, because both constellations are so close to the Sun when these showers reach their peak, the showers are difficult to view with the naked eye. Some of the early meteors are visible in the very early hours of the morning, usually an hour before dawn.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://observers.org/tac.mailing.list/2001/june/0109.html|title=Listen...to the Arietids!!|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=The Astronomy Connection|year=1999|author=James Turley |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929191104/http://observers.org/tac.mailing.list/2001/june/0109.html  |archivedate = September 29, 2007[/tpl] The meteors strike Earth's atmosphere at speeds around 39Â km/s.
