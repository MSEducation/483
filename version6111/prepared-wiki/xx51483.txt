[[Triple Crown of Cycling]]

CATEGORIES: Road bicycle racing terminology, Grand Tour (cycling)

The Triple Crown of Cycling is considered[tpl]By whom|date=April 2014[/tpl] the greatest achievement in cycling. Although more definitions for the term are used, mostly it means winning the Tour de France, the Giro d'Italia and the Road World Cycling Championship in one year,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.europeloton.com/2008/10/eddy-merckx-greatest-professional.html|title=Eddy Merckx: Greatest Professional Cyclist Ever|publisher=EuroPeloton|date=22 October 2008[/tpl] although occasionally a broader definition where one grand tour can be exchanged for the Vuelta a España is also seen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclinghalloffame.com/races/results/results_grand_tours.txt|title=Historical Results – The Grand Tours|publisher=Cycling Hall of Fame[/tpl] So far, the triple crown of cycling (in both the narrow and the broad definition) has been achieved by two cyclists, Eddy Merckx and Stephen Roche. It is considered the hardest title to win in professional road bicycle racing in the same year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/riders/2007/interviews/?id=stephen_roche07|title=An interview with Stephen Roche, August 8, 2007 — Taking the triple|publisher=Cyclingnews|date=8 August 2008[/tpl] The triple crown of cycling is not an official title, and there is no physical award given.

==Triple crowns won==

The Triple Crown has only been achieved twice (both times by winning Giro/Tour/Worlds):

==Near wins==

Some cyclists have been close to winning the triple crown of cycling, winning two of the three requirements.
Among those who came close are Italian Fausto Coppi, Frenchman Bernard Hinault, and later Spaniard Miguel Indurain, who finished second in the World Championships in 1993.

===Winning two grand tours in one year===

Coppi was the first rider in the history of the sport to win the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France in the same year which he did twice in 1949 and 1952. At the World road race championships in 1949 Coppi came third behind Rik Van Steenbergen of Belgium.  Merckx was the first rider to win the triple crown but he had already come close to winning it in 1972 when he won both the Tour and the Giro, coming fourth in the World road race. After his disappointment, Merckx broke the world hour record several weeks later.
Indurain won the Giro-Tour double in both 1992 and 1993 and in both years he was very active in the World Road Race. In 1992 he finished sixth but in 1993 Indurain was very close to winning the Triple crown when he finished second behind Lance Armstrong. 

===Winning one grand tour and world championship in one year===

Hinault was aiming for winning the triple crown during the 1980 season. That year he won the 1980 Giro d'Italia before going on to the 1980 Tour de France. However during the Tour, Hinault suffered from knee injury and despite winning three stages, he left the race while leading the general classification. Several weeks later he became world champion in Salanches.
In the table below are the results in other grand tours of cyclists who won the world championship and a grand tour in one year. DNF (did not finish) indicates that the cyclist started the race, but did not finish; DNE (did not enter) indicates that the cyclist did not enter the race.
