St. John's Preparatory School is a private, Roman Catholic high school in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, New York City, New York.  It is located within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn.

==Background==

The original St. John's Preparatory School was established in 1870 by the Vincentian Fathers as the prep department of St. John's College (later University).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stjohnsprepschool.org/info.htm|title=About St. John's|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=St. John's Preparatory School website|author=SJPS[/tpl] In 1955 the College moved out to its new campus and the prep school further expanded, taking over its former buildings. The original St. John's Prep was all-boys, located in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn on Lewis and Hart, and closed in 1972 due to a drop in enrollment and lack of demand for single-sex education.About Us – History: A Brief History
Mater Christi Diocesan High School was founded in 1961 through the efforts of Brian J. McEntegart, Bishop of Brooklyn. It had separate boys' and girls' divisions which were staffed by De La Salle Brothers and Sisters of Mercy respectively. In 1974 the divisions were merged to become a fully coeducational school. In 1977 it was turned over to a community-based board of trustees and became known as Mater Christi Catholic High School. The school motto was "That They May Have Life More Abundantly". In 1980 the school announced an affiliation with St. John's University. Mater Christi became the present-day St. John's Preparatory School.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/libraries/archives/prep.sju|title=St John's Prep Records|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=St. John's University website|author=SJU[/tpl] 
St. John's Prep is affiliated with St. John's University but is no longer run by the Vincentians. It is run by an independent board of trustees and lay staff, although there are several religious sisters and brothers from various orders on the teaching staff as well.
