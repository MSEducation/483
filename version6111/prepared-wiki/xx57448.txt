McJob (sometimes called joe job) is slang for a low-paying, low-prestige dead-end job that requires few skills and offers very little chance of intracompany advancement. The term McJob comes from the name of the fast-food restaurant McDonald's, but is used to describe any low-status job – regardless of the employer – where little training is required, staff turnover is high, and workers' activities are tightly regulated by managers. 

==History==

"McJob" was in use at least as early as 1986, according to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), which defines it as "An unstimulating, low-paid job with few prospects, esp. one created by the expansion of the service sector.""Merriam-Webster: 'McJob' is here to stay". The Associated Press. November 11, 2003.  Lack of job security is common.
The term was coined by sociologist Amitai Etzioni, and appeared in the Washington Post on August 24, 1986 in the article "McJobs are Bad for Kids".B170[tpl]cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/126648522.html?dids=126648522&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS&date=Aug+30%2C+1986&author=--+W.E.+Stephenson&pub=The+Washington+Post++(1974-Current+file)&edition=&startpage=A21&desc=McJobs+Are+Good+for+Kids | title=McJobs Are Good for Kids | date=1986-08-30 | first=-- W.E. | last=Stephenson[/tpl]
The term was popularized by Douglas Coupland's 1991 novel Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture, described therein as "a low-pay, low-prestige, low-dignity, low benefit, no-future job in the service sector.  Frequently considered a satisfying career choice by people who have never held one."Coupland, Douglas. Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture. St Martin's Press, 1991. p. 5 ISBN 0-312-05436-X
The term appears in the 1994 novel Interface (by Neal Stephenson and George Jewsbury) to describe in the abstract positions that are briefly held and underpaid. In the 1999 British film Human Traffic, one character's work in a generic burger outlet is referred to as a McJob.
In the face of objections from McDonald's, the term "McJob" was added to Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2003,.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/books/11/11/offbeat.mcjob.ap/ | work=CNN[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] In an open letter to Merriam-Webster, McDonald's CEO, James Cantalupo denounced the definition as a "slap in the face" to all restaurant employees, and stated that "a more appropriate  definition of a 'McJob' might be 'teaches responsibility.'" Merriam-Webster responded that "stood by the accuracy and appropriateness of their definition."
On 20 March 2007, the BBC reported that the UK arm of McDonald's planned a public petition to have the OED's definition of "McJob" changed.McDonald's McJob PetitionBBC NEWS | Talk about Newsnight | “Gis a McJob” Lorraine Homer from McDonald's stated that the company feels the definition is "out of date and inaccurate". McDonald's UK CEO, Peter Beresford, described the term as "demeaning to the hard work and dedication displayed by the 67,000 McDonald's employees throughout the UK".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com|title=CNN International, 24 March 2007[/tpl] The company would prefer the definition to be rewritten to "reflect a job that is stimulating, rewarding ... and offers skills that last a lifetime."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1628391,00.html | work=Time | title=Can McDonald's Alter the Dictionary? | date=2007-06-05 | accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/open_thread/2007/05/a_new_mcdefinition.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=A new McDefinition? | date=2007-05-24 | accessdate=2010-05-12 | first=Open | last=Thread[/tpl]
These comments run counter to the principle that dictionaries simply record linguistic usage rather than judge it, and that dropping the entry for "McJob" would be a precedent for bowdlerising definitions of other derogatory terms. McDonald's attempted to get all of its workers to sign the petition but many refused on the grounds that the current definition is accurate despite the company's complaint.
During the aforementioned arguments that broke out when Merriam-Webster included "McJob" in its new edition, McDonald's officials implied the company might bring a lawsuit against the dictionary based on this trademark issue, but never did so. McDonald's disputes that its jobs are poor, because the company has been nominated for employee awards that are created by employers.Britain's Top Employers 2008 - McDonald's Restaurants Ltd Company ProfileThe Times Top 100 Graduate Employers - The Top 100FT.com / Reports / Best workplaces 2007http://www.caterersearch.com/onlineteam/bptw/index.htmlwheretowork.com - Jobs recruitment employment vacancies careersEmployer of the Year Awards 2006McDonald's shrugs off 'McJob curse' to win Best Place to Work in Hospitality Award However, this was contradicted in the outcome of the UK McLibel court case, in which the judges ruled that it was fair to say that McDonald's employees worldwide "do badly in terms of pay and conditions".Press Release - McLibel Support Campaign; 25th March 1999

==Accuracy of the term==

There are often wide variations in how workers are actually treated depending on the local franchise owner.  Some employees start out in entry-level McJobs and later become assistant managers or managers, continuing to work at the same franchise for many years; however this is the exception rather than the norm.My Day on the Breakfast Shift McDonald's advertises that its CEO, Jim Skinner, began working at the company as a regular restaurant employee, and that 20 of its top 50 managers began work as regular crew members.09/21/05 - McDonald's Debuts Advertising on the World of Opportunity Under the Golden Arches
According to Jim Cantalupo, former CEO of McDonald's, the perception of fast-food work being boring and mindless is inaccurate, and over 1,000 of the men and women who now own McDonald's franchises began behind the counter.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3255883.stm | work=BBC News | title=McDonald's anger over McJob entry | date=2003-11-09 | accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl] Because McDonald's has over 400,000 employees and high turnover, Cantalupo's contention has been criticized as being invalid, working to highlight the exception rather than the rule.McJobs are giving Britain a reputation as Europe's offshore banana republic
In 2006, McDonald's undertook an advertising campaign in the United Kingdom to challenge the perceptions of the McJob. The campaign, developed by Barkers Advertising and supported by research conducted by Adrian Furnham, professor of psychology at University College London, highlighted the benefits of working for the organization, stating that they were "Not bad for a McJob". So confident were McDonald's of their claims that they ran the campaign on the giant screens of London's Piccadilly Circus."Not bad for a McJob?" Management Issues. June 8, 2006
