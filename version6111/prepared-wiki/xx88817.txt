Washo [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɒ|ʃ|oʊ[/tpl]Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student’s Handbook, Edinburgh (or Washoe; endonym wá:šiw ʔítlu)[tpl]cite web|title=The Washo Project: wá:šiw ʔítlu|url=http://washo.uchicago.edu/dictionary/results.php?AttestationID=4312&SearchBy=SearchGloss&SearchKey=washo|work=The Washo Project|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=9 September 2011[/tpl] is an endangered Native American language isolate spoken by the Washo on the California–Nevada border in the drainages of the Truckee and Carson Rivers, especially around Lake Tahoe. While there are only 20 elderly native speakers of Washo, since 1994 there has been a small immersion school that has produced a number of moderately fluent younger speakers. The immersion school has since closed its doors and the language program now operates through the Cultural Resource Department for the Washoe Tribe. The language is still very much endangered; however, there has been a renaissance in the language revitalization movement as many of the students who attended the original immersion school have become teachers.
Ethnographic Washo speakers belonged to the Great Basin culture area and they were the only non-Numic group of that area.d'Azevedo 1986 The language has borrowed from the neighboring Uto-Aztecan, Maiduan and Miwokan languages and is connected to both the Great Basin and California sprachbunds.

==Regional variation==

Washo shows very little geographic variation. Jacobsen (1986:108) wrote, "When there are two variants of a feature, generally one is found in a more northerly area and the other in a more southerly one, but the lines separating the two areas for the different features do not always coincide."

==Genetic relations==

Washo is conservatively considered a language isolate.Lyle Campbell.  American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America.  (1997, Oxford, pg. 125). Marianne Mithun.  The Languages of Native North America (1999, Cambridge, pg. 557) That is, it shares no demonstrated link with any other language, including its three direct neighboring languages, Northern Paiute (a Numic language of Uto-Aztecan), Maidu (Maiduan), and Sierra Miwok (Utian).  It is often classified as a Hokan language, but this language family is not universally accepted among specialists, nor is Washo's connection to it.WA SHE SHU: "The Washoe People", Past and Present.

The language was first described in "A Grammar of the Washo Language" by William H. Jacobsen, Jr. in a University of California, Berkeley PhD dissertation and this remains the sole complete description of the language.  There is no significant dialect variation. (Jacobsen's lifelong work with Washo is described at the University of Nevada Oral History Program.)

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

There are six distinct vowel qualities found in the Washo language, each of which occurs long and short. The sound quality of a vowel is dependent upon their length and the consonant they precede, as well as the stress put on the vowel.The Washo Project: Vowels
Vowels marked with the acute accent ( ´ ) are pronounced with stress, such as in the Washo ćigábut (summer).
In Washo, vowels can have either long or short length qualities; the longer quality is noted by appending a /:/ to the vowel, as in the above example míši milí:giyi. Vowels with such a mark are usually pronounced twice its normal length. This can be seen in the difference between the words móko (shoes) mó:ko (knee). However, vowels pronounced this way may not always be followed by a colon.

===Consonants===

Sequences not represented by a single letter in Washo almost always tend to occur in borrowed English words, such as the nd in k'indí (candy).The Washo Project: Consonants

==Grammar==

Washo has a complex tense system.
Washo uses partial or total reduplication of verbs or nouns to indicate repetitive aspect or plural number. Washo uses both prefixation and suffixation on nouns and verbs.

===Verbs===

Verbal inflection is rich with a large number of tenses. Tense is usually carried by a suffix that attaches to the verb. The tense suffix may signal recent past, intermediate past, the long-ago-but-remembered past, the distant past, the intermediate future, or the distant future. For example, the suffix -leg indicates that the verb describes an event that took place in the recent past, usually earlier the previous day as seen in the Washo sentence, "dabóʔo lew búʔlegi” (''the white man fed us’’).

===Nouns===

Possession in Washo is shown by prefixes added to the object. There are two sets of prefixes added; the first set being used if the object begins with a vowel and the second set being used if the object begins with a consonant.

==History==

In 2012, Lakeview Commons Park in South Lake Tahoe was renamed in the Washo language. "The Washoe Tribe has presented the name Tahnu Leweh (pronounced approx. [tpl]IPA|lewe[/tpl]) which, in native language, means "all the people's place." It is a name the Tribe would like to gift to El Dorado County and South Lake Tahoe as a symbol of peace, prosperity and goodness."
