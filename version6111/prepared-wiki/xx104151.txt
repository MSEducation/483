==Boundary Commission proposals==

Current proposals by the Boundary Commission for England would retain Oxfordshire's 6 constituencies, with changes to realign constituency boundaries
with the boundaries of current local government wards,
and to reduce the electoral disparity between constituencies. 
These changes will be implemented at the United Kingdom general election, 2010.

In 1885, Abingdon, Banbury and Woodstock expanded from Borough to County Constituencies. Oxfordshire was split between Banbury, Woodstock and the newly created Henley. Wallingford, a rotten borough, was folded into Abingdon and Henley.

In 1918, Woodstock was absorbed into Banbury and Henley.

===Used from 1974 to 1983===

In 1974, Mid Oxfordshire was split off from Banbury and Henley, and Abingdon became part of Oxfordshire.
In 1983, Mid Oxfordshire became Witney, and Oxford and Abingdon were rearranged into Oxford East, and Oxford West and Abingdon.
