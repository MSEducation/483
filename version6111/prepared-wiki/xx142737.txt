==Playing career==

Undrafted, Stapleton played for two seasons with the Green Bay Gamblers of the USHL. Stapleton then represented the University of Minnesota Duluth for four seasons, where he led the team in scoring as a freshman and had back-to-back 40 point seasons.
After a brief stint with the Portland Pirates of the AHL, he signed with Jokerit of the Finnish SM-liiga, completing a tryout which led to a one-year contract. During his first Jokerit season, Stapleton won the SM-liiga silver medal and finished second in playoff scoring.
On June 6, 2008, Stapleton signed as a free agent to the Toronto Maple Leafs for the 2008–09 season.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=461308|title=Leafs ink Stapleton | publisher =Toronto Maple Leafs | date = 2008-06-06 | accessdate = 2010-03-11[/tpl] Stapleton was assigned to the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League on September 26, 2008.

On July 1, 2009, Stapleton was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers with Pavel Kubina for Garnet Exelby and Colin Stuart.[tpl]cite web |url=http://thrashers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=434530|title=Thrashers acquire Kubina and Stapleton from Toronto | publisher =Atlanta Thrashers | date = 2008-07-01 | accessdate = 2010-03-11[/tpl] After signing with the Thrashers, Stapleton was then assigned to affiliate, the Chicago Wolves, for the 2009–10 season.[tpl]cite web |url=http://thrashers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=442968|title=Thrashers agree to terms with three RFA's | publisher =Atlanta Thrashers | date = 2009-07-17 | accessdate = 2010-03-11[/tpl]
For the 2010–2011 season, Stapleton signed a Professional Try-out agreement with the San Antonio Rampage of the AHL. On November 30, 2010, Stapleton was signed to a 2-year contract by the Atlanta Thrashers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://thrashers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=544919&navid=DL%7cATL%7chome|title=Thrashers Sign F Tim Stapleton; Activate F Patrice Cormier from IR and Assign to Chicago (AHL) | publisher =Atlanta Thrashers | date = 2010-11-30 | accessdate = 2010-11-30[/tpl]
On February 27, 2011, Stapleton scored his first goal since April 16, 2010. It was against his former team, the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was invited and accepted an invitation to join the USA hockey team for the 2011 IIHF tournament.
On April 10, 2011, Stapleton scored a goal in the 3rd period against the Pittsburgh Penguins. This was the last game of the season for the Thrashers and would be the last goal in their history. The following season, the Thrashers, including Stapleton, moved to Canada to become the Winnipeg Jets. For the first time Stapleton remained at the NHL level for an entire season, often playing the point on the power play despite playing his even-strength minutes as a third- or fourth-line forward; partly because of this, he logged career highs (and more than doubled his career NHL totals) in games played, goals, assists and points.
Despite this performance, Stapleton was not re-signed by the Jets when his contract expired the following summer. On July 10, 2012, it was announced that Stapleton had agreed to terms with Dinamo Minsk of the KHL. After a good performance with Dinamo, he signed in 2013 a two-year deal with Ak Bars Kazan.
Despite being born and raised in the Chicago area, Stapleton is not related to 1970s Chicago Blackhawks star defenseman Pat Stapleton or former Winnipeg Jets and Atlanta Thrashers forward Mike Stapleton, despite wearing the latter's number with both franchises.
