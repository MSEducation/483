==Biography==

He was born in Turin, Piedmont to Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy and Catherine Micaela of Spain, daughter of King Philip II of Spain. He spent much of his childhood at the Spanish court in Madrid at the court of his grandfather Philip II till he died in 1598 when the young Victor was 11. When his brother, Filippo Emanuele, died in 1605, he became legitimate heir to the Duchy of Savoy and received the loyalty swore of the court at Racconigi on 21 January 1607.
After a crisis with relationships with Spain, he was married to Henry IV of France's daughter Christine Marie in 1619.
Victor Amadeus became Duke of Savoy after his father's death in 1630. Charles Emmanuel's policies had brought a great instability in the relationships with both France and Spain, and troops were needed to defend the Duchy. As money was lacking to recruit mercenaries or train indigenous soldiers, Victor Amadeus signed a peace treaty with Spain. With the Treaty of Cherasco, Savoy was given back Pinerolo, although, according to a secret point of the agreement, that important stronghold was to remain with France in exchange for Geneve.
Subsequently, under the direction of Cardinal Richelieu, Victor Amadeus attempted to create an anti-Spanish league in Italy. He achieved two victories against the Spanish: In 1636 in the Battle of Tornavento and on September 8, 1637 in the Battle of Mombaldone.
On 25 September of that year, Victor Amadeus fell ill after a dinner offered by the Duke of Créqui. Carried to Turin, he died here on 7 October.
