==History==

Construction of the airport began in April 1940 as a Works Project Administration project.   In 1941 initial construction was completed.  Upon conclusion of the construction by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the facility was known as the Alachua Army Airfield and was used by the Army Air Corps and the Army Air Forces.
The airfield was declared surplus in September 1945 and turned over to the Army Corps of Engineers on October 1, 1946.   The War Assets Administration deeded the facility to the city of Gainesville in 1948 as a civil airport. The field was known as John R. Alison Airport or Gainesville Municipal Airport; the city operated, maintained, and improved the airport, which was renamed the Gainesville Regional Airport in October 1977. The airline terminal was dedicated to John R. Alison in 1979.
In 1986 the State Legislature passed a bill that established the Airport as the Gainesville-Alachua County Regional Airport Authority. The Airport Authority has nine board members, five selected by the City of Gainesville, three by the Governor and one by Alachua County, and continues to oversee the Airport.
On October 31, 2004 Gainesville Regional Airport hosted Air Force One[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.gainesville.com/article/20041101/LOCAL/211010329?p=1&tc=pg | title = 17,000 greet President Bush on brief stop in Gainesville | newspaper = Gainesville Sun | date = November 1, 2004[/tpl] during George W.

In recent years the Airport has substantially completed several projects: the refurbishment of its primary runway (11/29), piping of an open ditch parallel to that runway, and completion of two phases of the Terminal Renovation project. Three passenger boarding bridges have been installed.
Eclipse Aviation, maker of the Eclipse 500, operated its first factory service center in Gainesville until the company declared bankruptcy in 2009.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090428/ARTICLES/904289995 | title = Gainesville Airport gets new tenants | newspaper = Gainesville Sun | date = April 28, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.gainesville.com/article/20100109/ARTICLES/1091005?p=2&tc=pg | title = Turbulent times | newspaper = Gainesville Sun | date = January 9, 2010[/tpl] In 2012 Silver Airways moved its maintenance facilities from Ft.

Phase three of the renovations include renovations to the terminal area to increase capacity, improve aesthetics, and reduce environmental impacts. Parking lots were repaved, car rental facilities were expanded, and solar panels were installed. Vestibule entryways will replace sliding doors to reduce loss of conditioned air and energy-efficient LED lighting will be used outside.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.icontact-archive.com/W1hcT-6yhzaUul5qHvLmaulrQ2q82KpC?w=3 | title = Monthly Newsletter | publisher = Gainesville Regional Airport | date = July 2012[/tpl] In 2012 the airport conducted studies for a terminal expansion for an additional security line and new concourses.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.icontact-archive.com/W1hcT-6yhzaUul5qHvLmap5cI4IxhNR0?w=3 | title = Monthly Newsletter | publisher = Gainesville Regional Airport | date = August 2012[/tpl]
A new access road is also under construction. When completed, the two-lane roadway will connect the passenger terminal with nearby Waldo Road (SR 24)
The new entrance road is awaiting additional curbing and signage that has been ordered.
Taxiway E Work is underway on a new connector between the taxiway and apron as well as expanding the apron to make room for more aircraft parking.
Design work continues with the FDOT regarding rehabilitation of runway 7-25. The FDOT will be using the runway as a testing ground for a new pavement rehabilitation measure.  Some lighting work will be included in the project.
