Auchterlonie was honorary professional to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews for nearly a quarter of a century. He had begun his working life as an apprentice to a clubmaker and he ran clubmaking business for most of his adult life. There is still a golf shop called Aucterlonie's in St Andrews.
