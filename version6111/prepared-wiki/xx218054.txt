The 10 cm Gebirgshaubitze M 99 was a mountain howitzer used by Austria-Hungary during World War I. It consisted of the bronze barrel of the 10 cm Feldhaubitze M 99 on a new, narrow-gauge carriage that could be broken down for transport on animal carts. Like its brother, it lacked a modern recoil system, using only an ineffective spring-mounted spade brake, and was virtually obsolescent upon its introduction. Relatively few were made as the version of the standard 10 cm Feldhaubitze M 99 with a narrow, [tpl]convert|1.3|m|in|adj=on[/tpl] carriage was cheaper.
