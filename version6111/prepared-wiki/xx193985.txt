==History==

The electorate was established in the 1984 election. In 1984 and 1987, the seat was won by Colin Moyle of Labour, but Moyle retired in 1990 (when there was a swing against Labour) and the new Labour candidate Taito Phillip Field was defeated by Trevor Rogers of National.
In the 1993 election, the Otara seat was abolished, and Trevor Rogers moved east to the new Howick seat, which covered higher-income suburbs traditionally National. Taito Phillip Field moved to the Mangere seat
