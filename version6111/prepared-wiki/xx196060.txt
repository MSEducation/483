Information is a 1983 album by Welsh rock musician Dave Edmunds. The album was his second release for Arista Records (in the UK) and Columbia Records (in the US).
Information marked the first time in Edmunds' solo career that he collaborated with an outside producer. Electric Light Orchestra frontman Jeff Lynne produced two songs on the album: the title track, and the Lynne-penned "Slipping Away". The latter would become Edmunds' first American top-40 hit in 13 years (and his last top-40 hit to date), reaching #39 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album itself reached #51 on the Billboard 200 and #92 in the UK.
Other notable cover versions on the album include NRBQ's "I Want You Bad" and The J. Geils Band's "Wait".
