Weaver's debut crime thriller Chasing the Dead – which took ten years to get published[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shotsmag.co.uk/interview_view.aspx?interview_id=214 |title=Shots Magazine – Tim Weaver: Stopped in his tracks? |publisher=Shotsmag.co.uk |date=2 March 2011 |accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl] – was released in February 2010 and introduced the character of David Raker. Raker is a former journalist, who gave up his career in newspapers to care for his wife after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The book begins twelve months after her death, and centres on the mysterious reappearance of a man thought to have died in a car crash.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780241957400,00.html |title=Chasing the Dead – Tim Weaver – Penguin Books |publisher=Penguin.co.uk |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2013[/tpl] The Guardian called it "an impressive debut", though questioned the characterisation of Raker.[tpl]cite web|author=John O'Connell |url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/27/thriller-roundup-john-oconnell |title=The Bed I Made, Chasing the Dead, The Loss Adjuster and Without Warning | Book reviews | Books |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=1 September 2013[/tpl] On a BBC Radio Somerset interview, when asked about Raker's background, Weaver described how he drew on his own traumatic battle to have a child.[tpl]cite web|url=http://timweaverbooks.tumblr.com/ |title=Timweaverbooks.Com |publisher=Timweaverbooks.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=1 September 2013|quote="We had a very long and traumatic battle to have our daughter (and) a lot of Chasing the Dead – a lot of the beginning of that first book where (David Raker) is talking about how he feels about his wife – came out of that sense of loss."[/tpl]
His follow-up The Dead Tracks – which went to number one on the Amazon Kindle charts in March 2013[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.darleyanderson.com/news/tim-weaver |title=Darley Anderson Literary Agency – Latest News – Tim Weaver |publisher=DarleyAnderson.com |date= |accessdate=3 March 2013[/tpl] – was reviewed favourably by thriller author Luca Veste.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lucaveste.com/2011/09/26/the-dead-tracks-tim-weaver/ |title=The Dead Tracks – Tim Weaver | Guilty Conscience |publisher=Lucaveste.com |date= |accessdate=1 September 2013[/tpl] It concerned the hunt for a serial killer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141963884,00.html |title=The Dead Tracks – Tim Weaver – Penguin Books |publisher=Penguin.co.uk |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2013[/tpl]
The third novel in the series, Vanished, saw Raker looking into the case of a man disappearing on a London Underground train. The Guardian claimed Weaver's books were getting "better each time – tense, complex, sometimes horrific, written with flair as well as care.".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/20/thrillers-review-roundup |title=The Guardian: Thrillers – review roundup |publisher=TheGuardian.com |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl]
His fourth book, Never Coming Back, is the first in the series to move entirely away from London, and is set in Devon and Las Vegas. On 28 August 2013 it was announced that Never Coming Back had been selected for the Richard and Judy Autumn 2013 Book Club.[tpl]cite web|url=http://richardandjudy.whsmith.co.uk/20-13/autumn/timweaver-nevercomingback/ |title=WHSmith Richard and Judy Book Club |publisher=http://richardandjudy.whsmith.co.uk/20-13/autumn/timweaver-nevercomingback/ |date= |accessdate=28 August 2013[/tpl] On 18 November 2013, it was shortlisted for Crime & Thriller of the Year in the Specsavers National Book Awards,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalbookawards.co.uk/award/crime-thriller-of-the-year/ |title=Specsavers National Book Award – Crime & Thriller of the Year |publisher=http://www.nationalbookawards.co.uk/ |date=18 November 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl] and on 16 December 2013 iTunes included it in their 'Best of 2013' list, naming it Best British Crime Thriller.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipad-iphone/news/?newsid=3494097 |title=Macworld – Best apps, music, films, books, TV and podcasts of 2013 listed by Apple on iTunes |publisher=http://www.macworld.co.uk// |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=2 January 2014[/tpl]
On his decision to have David Raker specialise in missing persons cases, Weaver has said: "I just became very interested in the idea of a person going missing in an age where we have CCTV on every street, 24-hour rolling news channels, and constant access to cameras through our phones. It seemed like an intriguing starting point for a book. It sounds trite, but I was also struck by the human cost. Can you imagine how many stories must go untold when a person vanishes?"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crimefictionlover.com/2012/08/interview-tim-weaver/ |title=Interview: Tim Weaver |publisher=Crime Fiction Lover |date=17 September 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2013[/tpl]
