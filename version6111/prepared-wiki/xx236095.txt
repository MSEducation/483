Monroe William Smith, a former Boy Scout executive and wife Isabel Bacheler Smith, art teacher, founded American Youth Hostels as a young couple, in 1934, in Northfield, Massachusetts. Monroe Smith, also founded Youth Argosy, an organization intended to "provide travel opportunities for worthy young people of slender means"[tpl]cite book | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=lhDo0-A71SYC&pg=PA694 |isbn =0-275-99100-8 | title =American Students Organize: Founding the National Student Association after World War II : An Anthology and Sourcebook  | author = Eugene G.

After a promising start, Youth Argosy went bankrupt in 1951, largely due to a new Civil Aeronautics Board regulation aimed at small charter groups.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.moonlightramble.org/council/ | title = History of Hostelling International USA (formerly American Youth Hostels)| accessdate= 2009-10-16[/tpl]
Monroe went to the Mount Hermon School for boys in 1919.  After graduation he became a Massachusetts school teacher and boy scout leader. During a scout trip to Europe, Monroe and Isabel met Richard Schirrmann and learned about his German Hostelling Organization. They later attended the second International Hosteling Meeting in 1933 and brought the idea of Hosteling back to the United States where the American Hostelling International (AYH) movement was born.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.hiusa.org/about_us/history | title = History of Hostelling 1909-1934 | accessdate = 2009-10-16[/tpl]
