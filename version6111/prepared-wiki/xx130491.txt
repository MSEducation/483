Equestrian sports are among those contested at the Summer Olympic Games. Equine events began at the Olympics in 1900, when competitions in polo (considered by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to be a separate sport from the other equestrian events), vaulting, four-in-hand driving, mail coach driving, mixed hacks and hunters and three types of jumping (high jump, long jump and show-jumping) were held.[tpl]cite web|author=Kubatko, Justin|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/EQU/|title=Equestrianism|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=October 21, 2009|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Olympic Equestrian: The Sports and the Stories from Stockholm to Sydney|author=Bryant, Jennifer O.|date=2000|publisher=The Blood-Horse, Inc|location=Canada|isbn=1-58150-044-0|pages=24–25[/tpl] Most of these events were later discontinued, although equestrian events have continued through the 2008 Summer Olympics, and now include team and individual dressage, three-day eventing and show-jumping.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/sports/equestrian/index.shtml|title=Equestrian|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|accessdate=October 21, 2009[/tpl] Competitors in the modern pentathlon event also have to complete an equestrian show-jumping course, but this is not part of the equestrian events.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.2008.nbcolympics.com/modernpentathlon/insidethissport/index.html|title=Modern Pentathlon: Inside this Sport|publisher=NBC Universal|work=NBC Beijing 2008|accessdate=October 29, 2009[/tpl]

In two instances, the equestrian portion of the Olympics has been held in a different location from the rest of the games. The first was during the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia when, due to Australian quarantine laws, the equestrian portion was held in Stockholm, Sweden. At the next IOC meeting, it was decided to hold a special Equestrian Olympic Games several months before the actual Olympics, complete with its own opening and closing ceremonies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/equestrian/1956/|title=1956 Stockholm Equestrian Games|author=Kubatko, Justin|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=November 11, 2009[/tpl] This meant that Switzerland, which had officially boycotted the 1956 Games because of the Soviet Union's recent invasion of Hungary, still brought home a medal because of its participation in the equestrian portion several months earlier.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/05/07/f-olympics-history-1956.html|title=Three countries boycott the Games in Melbourne|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=November 18, 2009|date=August 7, 2009|work=CBC Sports[/tpl] The second instance was during the 2008 Summer Olympics, when the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong rather than Beijing. This decision was made when, in 2005, international veterinary groups refused to certify the main Olympic city as free of equine diseases. This would have resulted in horses leaving Beijing after the games and having to go through lengthy quarantine processes before being allowed to re-enter their home countries. Hong Kong also had the benefit of having better facilities, including a top equine hospital and one of only a few equine drug-testing labs in the world.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/sports/olympics/03horses.html?_r=1|title=Haze, Humidity and Horses|author=Bradsher, Keith|date=August 3, 2008|accessdate=November 11, 2009|journal=The New York Times[/tpl]
The Summer Olympics have included 2,129 equestrian participants, including 1,751 men and 378 women, from 69 countries.[tpl]#tag:ref|This number is approximate, because the number of competitors in early games is uncertain in many cases.|group=note[/tpl], of which 564 won a medal. As of the 2008 Olympics, 395 medals have been awarded to 31 NOCs. The oldest rider was 72-year-old Arthur von Pongracz of Austria at the 1936 Summer Olympics, while the youngest was 16-year-old Luiza Almeida of Brazil at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Three athletes (Reiner Klimke of Germany, Isabell Werth of Germany and Anky van Grunsven of the Netherlands) have each earned eight medals. Germany leads the country medalist rankings with 21 gold medals (42 overall),[tpl]#tag:ref|Note that this is only the medals won Germany as a whole country; medals won by the Unified Team of Germany (EUA) and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) are not included.

Canadian rider Ian Millar holds the record for the most Olympic equestrian appearances and matches the record for athletes in any sport, having competed in nine Olympics as of 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/08/24/olympics-stories.html|title=Olympic Moments|accessdate=January 18, 2011|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=August 24, 2008[/tpl]
