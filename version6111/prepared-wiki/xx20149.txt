</ref> In 2006, [[Warner Home Video]] released a new, Christmas-themed ''Looney Tunes'' direct-to-video movie called ''[[Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas]]'' featuring a wide array of characters working in a mega-store under the Scrooge-esque Daffy Duck. The movie parodies the famous book by [[Charles Dickens]], ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. Other ''Looney Tunes'' TV series included ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'' (2002, which had a similar premise to ''[[Muppet Babies]]''), ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]'' (2003, starring Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and [[Marvin the Martian]]), and ''[[Loonatics Unleashed]]'', (2005, featuring futuristic versions of the characters).
Although the cartoons are seldom seen on mainstream TV, thanks to revival theatrical screenings, and the Golden Collection DVD box sets, the Looney Tunes and its characters have remained a part of Western animation heritage. On October 22, 2007, Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons became available for the first time in High Definition via Microsoft's Xbox Live service, including some in Spanish.[tpl]cite press release |title= From Looney Tunes and iCarly to Shrek and SpongeBob SquarePants, Xbox 360 Launches Massive Library of Family Games and Entertainment |publisher= Microsoft |date= October 22, 2007 |url= http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2007/oct07/10-22XboxFamilyContentPR.mspx |accessdate =November 6, 2007 [/tpl] From February 29 – May 18, 2008, many Looney Tunes artifacts, including original animation cels and concept drawings, were on display at the Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, Ohio, just off the campus of Youngstown State University.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2008/feb/24/butler-goes-looney-tunes/ |title=Youngstown News, Butler Institute goes Looney Tunes |publisher=Vindy.com |date=February 24, 2008 |accessdate=October 29, 2012[/tpl] The exhibit had the studio come full circle, as the Warners were natives of the Youngstown area.

At the Cartoon Network upfronts in April 2010, "The Looney Tunes Show" was announced to premiere in November 2010. However, the series peremiere was pushed back to February 2011, then it was pushed back again to May 2011. Coming from Warner Bros.

The show features 2-minute music videos titled respectfully "Merrie Melodies", as a tribute to the Looney Tunes sister shorts, which features the characters singing original songs as well as CGI animated shorts starring Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, which were only shown during the shows first season. The Looney Tunes Show debuted May 3, 2011. At approximately the same time, reruns of the classic Looney Tunes library returned to Cartoon Network's daytime lineup.

==Licensing and ownership==

When the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies began in 1930, although Warner Bros. retained the rights to the cartoons and the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies brandnames, Harman and Ising owned the rights to the Bosko characters. When Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. in 1933, their former producer Leon Schlesinger started his own studio for Warner Bros. continuing the Looney Tunes series. Harman and Ising retained the rights to Bosko and began making Bosko cartoons at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1934. However these cartoons were not a success and in 1937 MGM fired Harman and Ising and formed their own studio to create MGM cartoons, with Harman and Ising retaining the rights to Bosko. Time Warner eventually acquired the characters from their estates. Meanwhile the Schlesinger studio continued to make popular cartoons until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. and since then, Warner Bros. has owned all rights to all post-1933 characters created by Leon Schlesinger Productions and Warner Bros. Cartoons. The rights to individual cartoons however are in other hands.
In 1955, Warner Bros. sold its black-and-white Looney Tunes (plus the black-and-white Merrie Melodies made after Harman and Ising left) into television syndication through their sale of the cartoons to Guild Films.http://books.google.com/books?id=5R0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=191+%2B+%22guild+films%22+%2B+1955&source=bl&ots=Jkg1MDjy-H&sig=BdWP8r5CFTh_P1t3XcowaDyjvy0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kyFGUbGNEImfyAGo3YHQAg&sqi=2&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=191%20%2B%20%22guild%20films%22%20%2B%201955&f=false The copyright to those cartoons were assigned to Sunset Productions. These cartoons were distributed by Guild Films until it went bankrupt and shut down in 1961. Warner Bros. then licensed the syndication rights to Seven Arts Associated, who distributed them until their purchase of Warner Bros. in 1967.
In 1956, Associated Artists Productions (a.a.p.) acquired for television most of Warner Bros' pre-1950[tpl]cite book|title=You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story|year=2008|page=255[/tpl]WB retained a pair of features from 1949 that they merely distributed, and all short subjects released on or after September 1, 1948; in addition to all cartoons released in August 1948. library, including all Merrie Melodies (except for those sold to Sunset and Lady, Play Your Mandolin!) and color Looney Tunes shorts that were released prior to August 1948. Unlike the sale to Sunset Productions, a.a.p. was allowed to keep the Warner titles intact and simply inserted an "Associated Artists Productions presents" title at the head of each reel (as a result, each Merrie Melodie cartoon had the song "Merrily We Roll Along" playing twice).geocities.com a.a.p. was later sold to United Artists, who merged the company into its television division—United Artists Television.
In 1981, UA was sold to MGM, and five years later, Ted Turner acquired the pre-May 1986 MGM library. He also acquired the rights to the a.a.p. library. In 1996, Turner's company, Turner Broadcasting System (whose Turner Entertainment division oversaw the film library), was purchased by Time Warner who also owned Warner Bros.. Today, Warner Home Video holds the video rights to the entire Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies animated output by virtue of Time Warner's ownership of Turner Entertainment—this is why their Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD box sets include cartoons from both the pre-8/48 Turner-owned and post-7/48 Warner Bros. owned periods. As of 2013, all Warner Bros' animated output are under the same Time Warner umbrella of ownership.
Starting in 1960, the cartoons were repackaged into several different TV programs that remained popular for several decades before being purchased by Turner Broadcasting Systems."http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/tv/". Looney Tunes on Television. Retrieved November 7, 2010. Turner's Cartoon Network reran the cartoons for 12 years, from their start in 1992 until 2004, and intermittently since then.
Several dozen Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts from before approximately 1945 have lapsed into the public domain and are thus freely distributed through various unofficial releases.
The exclusive sculpturing license for all Looney Tunes characters is currently owned by American animator and sculptor David Kracov.http://money.cnn.com/video/news/2008/06/25/news.tuart.072508.kracov.cnnmoney/

==Censorship==

A handful of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts are no longer aired on American television nor are they available for sale by Warner Bros. because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes of black people, American Indians, Asians such as Japanese (especially during WWII, as in Tokio Jokio and Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips), Chinese, and Germans included in some of the cartoons.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.germanhollywood.com/warner.html |title="The Warner Brothers: Albert, Harry, Jack, and Sam Warner".|accessdate=January 23, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071018170049/http://www.germanhollywood.com/warner.html  |archivedate = October 18, 2007[/tpl] Eleven cartoons that prominently featured stereotypical black characters (and a few passing jokes about Japanese people, as in Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs and Jungle Jitters) were withdrawn from distribution in 1968 and are known as the Censored Eleven.
In 1999 all Speedy Gonzales cartoons were removed from air by Cartoon Network because of their alleged stereotyping of Mexicans.Speedy Gonzales Caged by Cartoon Network, www.foxnews.com, 28 March 2002 When many Hispanics protested that they were not offended, and fondly remembered Speedy Gonzales cartoons as a representation of their youth and nation's individuality, these shorts were made available for broadcast again in 2002.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=070aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lz8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6719,566640&dq=speedy+gonzalez+cartoon+network&hl=en |title=Cartoon Network putting Mexican mouse back in the lineup |accessdate=November 6, 2010 |last=Emling |first=Shelly |date=June 21, 2002 |work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel[/tpl]
In addition to these most notorious cartoons, many Warner Bros. cartoons contain fleeting or sometimes extended gags that reference then-common racial or ethnic stereotypes. The release of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3 includes a disclaimer at the beginning of each DVD in the volume given by Whoopi Goldberg which explains that the cartoons are products of their time and contain racial and ethnic stereotypes that "were wrong then and they are wrong today", but the cartoons are presented on the DVD uncut and uncensored because "editing them would be the same as denying that the stereotypes existed."
A written disclaimer, similar to the words spoken by Goldberg in Volume 3, is shown at the beginning of each DVD in the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 4, Volume 5, and Volume 6 sets, as well as the Daffy Duck and Foghorn Leghorn Looney Tunes Super Stars sets:
