==History==

The Coalition for the National Museum of the American People was created by Sam Eskenazi, former Director of Public Information for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.  According to Eskenazi, the concept for the museum originated when he was passing the Jamie L. Whitten Building, the only office building on the National Mall.  According to Eskenazi:
 I asked myself, “If this were a museum, what kind of museum could it be?” The answer: a museum that would tell the stories of all of the peoples coming to this land. I came up with a name for the museum on the spot - the National Museum of the American People. It is a testament to the need for the museum that many people, when told about the proposal, were surprised that such a museum doesn't already exist.''[tpl]cite web|last=Eskenazi|first=Sam|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68WQaWZen|archivedate=2012-06-18|url=http://www.nmap2015.com/history.html|title=The Story Behind the Museum|work=National Museum of the American People|publisher=Coalition for the National Museum of the American People|date=2014-04-29|accessdate=2012-06-18[/tpl] 
On September 11, 2008, Congressman Maurice Hinchey introduced a bill, H.R. 6883, into the 110th United States Congress to "establish a commission to study the establishment of the National Museum of the American People, ....".[tpl]cite web|last=Hinchey|first=Maurice|authorlink=Maurice Hinchey|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-110hr6883ih/pdf/BILLS-110hr6883ih.pdf|title=H.R. 6883, 110th Congress, 2d Session:  National Commission to Study the Establishment of the National Museum of the American People Act of 2008|format=PDF|publisher=Government Printing Office|date=2008-09-11|accessdate=2011-10-06[/tpl] However, the bill did not leave the United States House Committee on Natural Resources.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR06883:@@@X|title=Bill Summary & Status: 110th Congress (2007-2008): H.R. 6883: All Congressional Actions|work=THOMAS|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2012-03-21[/tpl]  Eskenazi then created a coalition of private not-for-profit ethnic and nationality groups to support the creation of the museum in 2009 and 2010.  In February, 2011 these organizations announced a formal launch of the project at a press event in Washington, D.C.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tbd.com/articles/2011/02/group-wants-to-build-national-museum-of-the-american-people-immigration-museum-51662.html|title=Group wants to build National Museum of the American People immigration museum|accessdate=2012-06-18 |last=Conneen|first=Mike|work=TBD|publisher=Allbritton Communications Company|date=2011-07-09[/tpl]  Shortly thereafter the Washington City Paper named it the "Best Museum That Doesn't Exist Yet" in the newspaper's "Best Of D.C. 2011" issue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/bestofdc/peopleandplaces/2011/best-museum-that-doesn-t-exist-yet |title=Best Museum That Doesn’t Exist Yet|work=Washington City Paper|publisher=CL Washington, Inc.|accessdate=2011-09-21|last=DePillis |first=Lydia |authorlink=|date=[/tpl]
In May 2011, Congressman Jim Moran agreed to be the originating sponsor of a resolution calling for a study group, expressing concerns about balkanization of the National Mall.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theroot.com/views/not-welcome-neighborhood |title=Will White People Go to the National Black Museum?|accessdate=2012-06-18 |last=Hopkinson|first=Natalie|work=The Root|publisher=The Slate Group, a Division of The Washington Post Company|date=2011-05-20[/tpl]  In partnership with Eskenazi's Coalition for the National Museum of the American People, Moran introduced into the 112th United States Congress on July 7, 2011, a concurrent resolution, H.

Res. 27) into the 113th Congress.
One site proposed for the museum is an overlook at the south end of L'Enfant Promenade that now contains the National Park Service's Benjamin Banneker Park, a half mile (800 m) south of the Smithsonian Institution's "Castle" on the National Mall.(1) [tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68WQsHAZO|archivedate=2012-06-18|url=http://www.nmap2015.com/news_architecture.html|title=Stunning Design Suggested for National American People Museum At Washington, DC's L'Enfant Plaza Overlook Site|work=National Museum of the American People|publisher=Coalition of the National Museum of the American People|date=2012-04-29|accessdate=2012-06-18[/tpl] (2) [tpl]cite web|last=Roig-Franzia|first=Manuel|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/one-museum-over-all/2011/09/23/gIQA537mAL_story.html|title=Proposed 'melting pot' of American history: One museum over all?|work=Lifestyle|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2011-09-30|accessdate=2011-10-05[/tpl] (3) [tpl]cite book|url=http://www.efl.fhwa.dot.gov/files/projects/environment/LEnfantPublicEA_Document.pdf|title=Environmental Assessment for Improvements to L'Enfant Promenade and Benjamin Banneker Park|format=PDF|date=2006-06|publisher=Department of Transportation, Government of the District of Columbia and Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division, Federal Highway Administration|pages=1-3, 1-4, 1–5, 1–6|accessdate=2011-10-09[/tpl]

==Museum contents and exhibitions==

The Museum project creators have proposed a number of components to be considered for a final institution.  Among these are a permanent exhibition (tentatively called The Story of the American People), a Center for Advanced Studies drawing upon a group of over 50 scholars who have offered their support to the project,[tpl]cite web|last=Lancaster|first=Jeffrey|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68WQC01E2|archivedate=2012-06-18|url=http://www.nmap2015.com/scholars.html|title=Scholars Affiliated with the Coalition for the National Museum of the American People|work=National Museum of the American People|publisher=Coalition of the National Museum of the American People|date=2012-04-29|accessdate=2012-06-18[/tpl] a National Genealogical Center, an Education and Resource Center and an archival library of American Migration and Immigration.[tpl]cite web|last=Lancaster|first=Jeffrey |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68WQJLob9|archivedate=2012-06-18|url=http://www.nmap2015.com/components.html|title=Components of the Museum|work=National Museum of the American People|publisher=Coalition of the National Museum of the American People|date=2012-04-29|accessdate=2012-06-18[/tpl]
