==History==

The Ministry of Home Affairs was set up in 1959 when Singapore attained self-government. Housed at the Empress Place Building, it remained there until September 16, 1963 when Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia and internal affairs became a federal responsibility.
After Singapore became independent on August 9, 1965, Home Affairs returned to Empress Place address as part of the Ministry of Interior and Defence (MID). MID stayed there for several months before it was re-located to Pearl's Hill (former Lower Barracks of Police).
On August 11, 1970, the Ministry of Interior and Defence was separated into two ministries, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Defence. MHA remained at Pearl's Hill until August 1977 when it moved into its previous home at the Phoenix Park in Tanglin Road.
MHA, together with Police Headquarters, moved to the New Phoenix Park at 28 Irrawaddy Road on August 18, 2001
