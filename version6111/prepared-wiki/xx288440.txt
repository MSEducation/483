The Wayne County Courthouse, at 510 Pearl St. in Wayne, Nebraska, is a Richardsonian Romanesque-style historic courthouse that was built in 1899. 
It is a [tpl]convert|70|x|80|ft|adj=on[/tpl] building located in the center of a [tpl]convert|4|acre|adj=on[/tpl] square amidst, somewhat unexpectedly, a residential neighborhood.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
Its cornerstone indicates that it was designed by Minneapolis architects Orff & Guilbert, but it seems to have been wholly designed by Fremont D. Orff (1856â€“1914) alone, and it was built by Omaha contractors Rowles & Moore.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/79001458.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Wayne County Courthouse |author=Daniel Kidd |date=February 1979 |publisher=National Park Service[/tpl] and accompanying three photos from 1977See commons photo of cornerstone at :Commons:File:Wayne County Courthouse (Nebraska) cornerstone.JPG
