==History==

"You Run Away" was written by Ed Robertson, and was partially inspired by Steven Page's departure from the band in February 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/B/Barenaked_Ladies/2010/02/22/12982411.html |title=CANOE - JAM!

The music video for "You Run Away" was released on February 22, 2010,[tpl]citation | url = http://barenakedladies.com/blog/barenaked-ladies/201002/22-watch-premiere-new-video-you-run-away | title = Watch the Premiere of the New Video for "You Run Away" | publisher =  Barenaked Ladies | date = 22 February 2010[/tpl] making it their first music video they have actually appeared in since 2003's "Testing 1,2,3". The song's video uses the radio edit of the song, which cuts half of the instrumental intro, and half of the second chorus which is a double-chorus on the album version. The two halves of the chorus are cross-mixed between "you could turn and stay" and "but you run away from me".
