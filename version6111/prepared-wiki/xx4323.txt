Introduced in 1957, the Sportster family were conceived as racing motorcycles, and were popular on dirt and flat-track race courses through the 1960s and 1970s. Smaller and lighter than the other Harley models, contemporary Sportsters make use of 883 cc or 1,200 cc Evolution engines and, though often modified, remain similar in appearance to their racing ancestors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/harley-davidson-sportster-1000.aspx|title=1972–1985 Harley-Davidson Sportster 1000|publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=May 21, 2010|date=March–April 2010|author=Richard Backus [/tpl]
Up until the 2003 model year, the engine on the Sportster was rigidly mounted to the frame. The 2004 Sportster received a new frame accommodating a rubber-mounted engine. This made the bike heavier and reduced the available lean angle, while it reduced the amount of vibration transmitted to the frame and the rider, providing a smoother ride for rider and passenger.Motorcycle Cruiser First Ride: 2004 Harley-Davidson Sportster Motorcycles. Motorcyclecruiser.com (2011-02-28). Retrieved on July 7, 2011.
In the 2007 model year, Harley-Davidson celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Sportster and produced a limited edition called the XL50, of which only 2000 were made for sale worldwide. Each motorcycle was individually numbered and came in one of two colors, Mirage Pearl Orange or Vivid Black. Also in 2007, electronic fuel injection was introduced to the Sportster family, and the Nightster model was introduced in mid-year. In 2009, Harley-Davidson added the Iron 883 to the Sportster line, as part of the Dark Custom series.
In the 2008 model year, Harley-Davidson released the XR1200 Sportster in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The XR1200 had an Evolution engine tuned to produce [tpl]convert|91|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl], four-piston dual front disc brakes, and an aluminum swing arm.  Motorcyclist featured the XR1200 on the cover of its July 2008 issue and was generally positive about it in their "First Ride" story, in which Harley-Davidson was repeatedly asked to sell it in the United States.[tpl]Cite journal|last= Cathcart|first= Alan|date=July 2008|title= First Ride: 2008 Harley-Davidson XR1200 – Get Sporty!|journal=Motorcyclist|series= |pages= 49–53|publisher=Source Interlink Magazines|pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote=[/tpl]
One possible reason for the delayed availability in the United States was the fact that Harley-Davidson had to obtain the "XR1200" naming rights from Storz Performance, a Harley customizing shop in Ventura, Calif.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/2009-harley-davidson-xr1200.aspx|title=2009 Harley-Davidson XR1200|publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=August 20, 2009|date=September–October 2009|author=Richard Backus[/tpl] The XR1200 was released in the United States in 2009 in a special color scheme including Mirage Orange highlighting its dirt-tracker heritage. The first 750 XR1200 models in 2009 were pre-ordered and came with a number 1 tag for the front of the bike, autographed by Kenny Coolbeth and Scott Parker and a thank you/welcome letter from the company, signed by Bill Davidson.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] The XR1200 was discontinued in model year 2013.
With the exception of the street-going XR1000 of the 1980s and the XR1200 most Sportsters made for street use have the prefix XL in their model designation. For the Sportster Evolution engines used since the mid-1980s, there have been two engine sizes. Motorcycles with the smaller engine are designated XL883, while those with the larger engine were initially designated XL1100. When the size of the larger engine was increased from 1,100 cc to 1,200 cc, the designation was changed accordingly from XL1100 to XL1200. Subsequent letters in the designation refer to model variations within the Sportster range, e.g. the XL883C refers to an 883 cc Sportster Custom, while the XL1200S designates the now-discontinued 1200 Sportster Sport.

===VRSC===

Introduced in 2001, the VRSC family bears little resemblance to Harley's more traditional lineup. Competing against Japanese and American muscle bikes in the upcoming power cruiser segment, the "V-Rod" makes use of an engine developed jointly with Porsche that, for the first time in Harley history, incorporates overhead cams and liquid cooling. The V-Rod is visually distinctive, easily identified by the 60-degree V-Twin engine, the radiator and the hydroformed frame members that support the round-topped air cleaner cover. The VRSC platform was also used for factory drag-racing motorcycles.
In 2008, Harley added the anti-lock braking system as a factory installed option on all VRSC models. Harley also increased the displacement of the stock engine from [tpl]convert|1130|to|1250|cc|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl], which had only previously been available from Screamin' Eagle, and added a slipper clutch as standard equipment.
VRSC models include:
VRSCA: V-Rod (2002–2006), VRSCAW: V-Rod (2007–2010), VRSCB: V-Rod (2004–2005), VRSCD: Night Rod (2006–2008), VRSCDX: Night Rod Special (2007–2010), VRSCSE: Screamin' Eagle CVO V-Rod (2005), VRSCSE2: Screamin' Eagle CVO V-Rod (2006), VRSCR: Street Rod (2006–2007), VRSCX: Screamin' Eagle Tribute V-Rod (2007), VRSCF: V-Rod Muscle (2009–2010).
VRSC models utilize the Revolution engine (VR), and the street versions are designated Street Custom (SC). After the VRSC prefix common to all street Revolution bikes, the next letter denotes the model, either A (base V-Rod: discontinued), AW (base V-Rod + W for Wide with a 240 mm rear tire), B (discontinued), D (Night Rod: discontinued), R (Street Rod: discontinued), SE and SEII(CVO Special Edition), or X (Special edition). Further differentiation within models are made with an additional letter, e.g., VRSCDX denotes the Night Rod Special.

====VRXSE====

The VRXSE V-Rod Destroyer is Harley-Davidson's production drag racing motorcycle, constructed to run the quarter mile in less than ten seconds. It is based on the same revolution engine that powers the VRSC line, but the VRXSE uses the Screamin' Eagle 1,300 cc "stroked" incarnation, featuring a 75 mm crankshaft, 105 mm Pistons, and 58 mm throttle bodies.
The V-Rod Destroyer is not a street legal motorcycle. As such, it uses "X" instead of "SC" to denote a non-street bike.  "SE" denotes a CVO Special Edition.

===Street===

The Street, Harley Davidson's newest platform and their first all new platform in thirteen years, was designed to appeal to younger riders looking for a lighter bike.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/news/auto-blog/harley-davidson-street-500-750|title=2015 Harley-Davidson Street 500/750: Futureproof Hogs?|date=November 13, 2013|accessdate=November 19, 2013|publisher=Popular Mechanics[/tpl] The Street 750 model was launched in India at the 2014 Indian Auto Expo, Delhi-NCR on 5 February 2014. The Street 750 weighs 218 kg and has a ground clearance of 144 mm giving it the lowest weight and the highest ground clearance of Harley-Davidson motorcycles currently available.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.zigwheels.com/news-features/recent-launches/2014-indian-auto-expo-harleydavidson-street-750-launched-at-rs-41-lakh/17815/|title= 2014 Indian Auto Expo: Harley-Davidson Street 750 launched at Rs 4.1 lakh|last1= Nadar|first1= Arun Mohan|date= 5 February 2014|website= ZigWheels|publisher= Times Internet|accessdate=6 February 2014[/tpl]
The Street 750 uses an all-new, liquid-cooled, 60° V-twin engine called the Revolution X. In the Street 750, the engine displaces [tpl]convert|749|cc|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] and produces 65 Nm at 4,000 rpm. A six speed transmission is used.
The Street 750 and the smaller-displacement Street 500 will be available in late 2014. Street series motorcycles for the North American market will be built in Harley-Davidson's Kansas City, Missouri plant, while those for other markets around the world will be assembled in their plant in Bawal, India.

==Custom Vehicle Operations==

Custom Vehicle Operations (CVO) is a team within Harley-Davidson that produces limited-edition customizations of Harley's stock models. Every year since 1999, the team has selected two to five of the company's base models and added higher-displacement engines, performance upgrades, special-edition paint jobs, more chromed or accented components, audio system upgrades, and electronic accessories to create high-dollar, premium-quality customizations for the factory custom market. The models most commonly upgraded in such a fashion are the Ultra Classic Electra Glide, which has been selected for CVO treatment every year from 2006 to the present, and the Road King, which was selected in 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2008. The Dyna, Softail, and VRSC families have also been selected for CVO customization.

==Environmental record==

The Environmental Protection Agency conducted emissions-certification and representative emissions test in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 2005. Subsequently, Harley-Davidson produced an "environmental warranty."  The warranty ensures each owner that the vehicle is designed and built free of any defects in materials and workmanship that would cause the vehicle to not meet EPA standards.Representative Emissions Test March 9, 2005 retrieved May 14, 2008  In 2005, the EPA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) confirmed Harley-Davidson to be the first corporation to voluntarily enroll in the One Clean-Up Program. This program is designed for the clean-up of the affected soil and groundwater at the former York Naval Ordnance Plant. The program is backed by the state and local government along with participating organizations and corporations.Former York Naval Ordnance Plant 2005. Retrieved May 14, 2008
Paul Gotthold, Director of Operations for the EPA, congratulated the motor company:

Harley-Davidson motorcycles has long been associated with the sub-cultures of the biker, motorcycle clubs, and Outlaw motorcycle clubs, or one percenters.

===Origin of "Hog" nickname===

Beginning in 1920, a team of farm boys, including Ray Weishaar, who became known as the "hog boys," consistently won races. The group had a live hog as their mascot. Following a win, they would put the hog on their Harley and take a victory lap.Harley-Davidson – History In 1983, the Motor Company formed a club for owners of its product taking advantage of the long-standing nickname by turning "hog" into the acronym HOG., for Harley Owners Group. Harley-Davidson attempted to trademark "hog", but lost a case against an independent Harley-Davidson specialist, The Hog Farm of West Seneca, NY,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-hog-farm.com/another-victory.html |title=Decision at the U.S. Second Circuit Federal Court of Appeals N.Y.C.: Corporate Harley-Davidson LOST the Hog Trademark |publisher=The-hog-farm |date=January 15, 1999 |accessdate=January 5, 2009[/tpl] in 1999 when the appellate panel ruled that "hog" had become a generic term for large motorcycles and was therefore unprotectable as a trademark.[tpl]cite web  | title = Motorcycle manufacturer has no trademark right in 'hog'  | publisher=News Media Update  | url = http://www.rcfp.org/news/1999/0208k.html  | accessdate =December 13, 2007[/tpl]

===Choppers===

Harley-Davidson FL "big twins" normally had heavy steel fenders, chrome trim, and other ornate and heavy accessories. After World War II, riders wanting more speed would often shorten the fenders or take them off completely to reduce the weight of the motorcycle. These bikes were called "choppers" because parts considered unnecessary were chopped off. Those who made or rode choppers, especially members of outlaw bike gangs like the Hells Angels, referred to stock FLs as "garbage wagons".[ref]References:

===Harley Owners Group===

Harley-Davidson established the Harley Owners Group (HOG) in 1983 to build on the loyalty of Harley-Davidson enthusiasts as a means to promote a lifestyle alongside its products.
