[[2008–09 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season]]

CATEGORIES: Tottenham Hotspur F.C. seasons, English football clubs 2008–09 season

The 2008–09 season was Tottenham Hotspur 17th season in the Premier League, their 30th successive season in the top division of the English football league system and the 126th year of their history.
After finishing 11th in the 2007–08 season, Tottenham began the season under the leadership of Spaniard Juande Ramos, drafted in to replace Martin Jol mid-way through the previous season. However, after suffering the worst start of a league season in Tottenham's history, with no wins in eight league games and only two points, Ramos was sacked and replaced by seasoned manager Harry Redknapp, who quickly eliminated the continental structure that the club had established over the past seasons. Tottenham's league form improved and mainly remained positive with the final position of eighth a far cry from the relegation places Tottenham had occupied throughout the campaign. Spurs also reached the final of the League Cup, and, as the reigning champions, faced league leaders Manchester United but lost 4–1 on penalties. With an average attendance of 35,929, Tottenham had the ninth highest attendance in the Premier League.
Tottenham drafted in a total of 15 players through transfers and sold 19 players during the combined summer and winter transfer windows.

Following comments made by Sir Alex Ferguson indicating confidence over signing Dimitar Berbatov even though negotiations were not yet underway, the club issued a press statement on 18 July 2008 on behalf of Daniel Levy, saying that both Manchester United and Liverpool had been reported to the Premier League over comments their respective managers had made which were seen as unsettling both Dimitar Berbatov and Irish striker Robbie Keane with a view of enticing them away from Tottenham.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7514933.stm |title=Spurs report Liverpool & Man Utd|publisher=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=18 July 2008|accessdate=18 July 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080719092016/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7514933.stm| archivedate= 19 July 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Levy said of United boss Alex Ferguson:
"Today's public comments by Manchester United's manager, announcing that he has made an offer for Dimitar and is confident that the deal will go through with time working in their favour, is a blatant example of sheer arrogance and interference with one of our players. It is also probably one of the worst offences by any manager in the Premier League to date and is unbelievably hypocritical given his recent comments in respect of Cristiano Ronaldo and Real Madrid.
I have absolutely no wish to sell either player and to date we have not accepted any offer for either. However, when a player's head is turned and their commitment is absent, particularly when they occupy key positions such as that of striker, they become a negative influence in a team dressing room in which they were once a positive addition and influence. This is the situation we now have on our hands, with both Dimitar and Robbie having made it clear that they wish to leave for Manchester United and Liverpool respectively."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/articles/chairmanspeaksout180708.html|title=Chairman Speaks Out|publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

Throughout July, Tottenham parted ways with many first team members of the squad, On 23 July 2008, it was announced that the club had sold the services of Teemu Tainio. The Finnish midfielder joined Sunderland on a three-year contract,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/articles/teemutransfer230708.html|title=Teemu transfer|publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

The following day, former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson signed a five-year contract with Blackburn Rovers for £3.5 million, having played for Spurs for four years. Robinson joined the club from Leeds United in May 2004 and made 175 appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring once against Watford in 2007.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/articles/robbotorovers.html|title=Robbo to Rovers|publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

On 28 July 2008, Tottenham agreed to sell Robbie Keane to Liverpool for a
total that could amount to £20.3 million. With the sale, Tottenham also agreed to drop its official
complaint to the Premier League about Liverpool's pursuit of Keane after Liverpool issued a formal apology and made a donation to the Tottenham Foundation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/7528735.stm|title=Liverpool complete Keane transfer|publisher=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=28 July 2008|accessdate=28 July 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080729003203/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/7528735.stm| archivedate= 29 July 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Levy issued a statement coinciding with the confirmation of the Keane transfer:
"I was incredibly disappointed when I first heard, not only that Liverpool had been working behind the scenes to bring Robbie to Anfield, but that Robbie himself wanted to go and he submitted a transfer request to this effect. I have already made my opinion clear on the nature of this transaction. I don't regard it as a transfer deal – that is something which happens between two clubs when they both agree to trade – this is very much an enforced sale, for which we have agreed a sum of £19m as compensation plus a potential further £1.3m in additional compensation."
On 30 July 2008, French midfielder Steed Malbranque became the third player in a week to leave, following Tainio and Chimbonda to Sunderland for a fee of £7.8 million. Later the same day, Tottenham announced they had reached agreement with Blackburn Rovers for the transfer of David Bentley to the club for £15 million.[tpl]cite news | title = Bentley to the Lane | publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

===May===

Against the norm, there were four Premier league fixtures in May. Tottenham took on relegation strugglers West Bromwich Albion at White Hart Lane, looking to bounce back from the heavy defeat at Old Trafford. The game was settled by a well placed Jermaine Jenas effort from just outside the area on the stroke of half time, and secured Spurs' fifth home win a row. It was their fourth 1–0 win at home in a row, and sixth consecutive home clean sheet, leaving them on the verge of a club record of the fewest goals conceded at home in a season.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8014842.stm |title=Spurs 1–0 West Brom |publisher=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=2 May 2009|accessdate=2 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090503064846/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8014842.stm| archivedate= 3 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
A week later, Tottenham travelled to Goodison Park, The game was marred by the pre-match news that the brother of Wilson Palacios had been confirmed dead in his native Honduras, causing him to leave the team hotel hours before the game.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/8042102.stm |title=Palacios brother feared murdered |publisher=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=9 May 2009|accessdate=9 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090514023720/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/8042102.stm| archivedate= 14 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] This was one of many factors that caused Harry Redknapp to go with an unorthodox 3–5–2 formation, notably bringing in Gareth Bale at left wing-back for the Welsh youngster's first league start for four months. A game that finished 0–0 for the second consecutive season earned Tottenham a point in their European quest.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8023046.stm |title=Everton 0–0 Spurs |publisher=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=9 May 2009|accessdate=9 May 2009 |first=Pranav |last=Soneji| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090510232837/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8023046.stm| archivedate= 10 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The following Saturday, Tottenham went into their final home game of the season against Manchester City, with a target of setting a new club record for goals conceded at home. They simply had to concede no more than a goal to break the record of eleven which had stood since 1920. Spurs could also end Manchester City's hopes of Europe next season, while increasing their own slender hopes. Tottenham took the lead in the 29th minute, when Jermain Defoe improvised with a back heel from close range from Tom Huddlestone's cross. In the second half Spurs were forced to rue their earlier missed chances when Valeri Bojinov grabbed an equaliser, in the process scoring the first away goal at the lane since James Beattie's consolation in January. A draw was looking increasingly likely until Fraizer Campbell was brought down to win a penalty, which was converted by Robbie Keane. The game finished 2–1 and Tottenham, having conceded just ten goals at home all season, broke their own club record and ensured ending the season with the best home defence in the 2008–09 season.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8038291.stm |title=Spurs 2–1 Man City |publisher=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=16 May 2009|accessdate=16 May 2009 |first=Les |last=Roopanarine| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090517134635/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8038291.stm| archivedate= 17 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Tottenham went into the final game of the season at Anfield, with a small chance of making 7th place and Europe, needing to beat Liverpool, and hoping that Everton could get three points against Fulham at Craven Cottage. Everton won 2–0. Fernando Torres and an own goal by Alan Hutton had Liverpool 2–0 up. A goal from Robbie Keane on his return to Anfield gave Tottenham a glimmer of hope, but just three minutes later allowed Yossi Benayoun to sew the game up for the home team with Tottenham Hotspur finishing the season with a 3–1 loss.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8048312.stm |title=Liverpool 3–1 spurs |publisher=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=24 May 2009|accessdate=24 May 2009 |first=Oliver |last=Brett| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090525222058/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8048312.stm| archivedate= 25 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Spurs finished the season in 8th place, a turnaround in form pushing them into higher reaches of the league, when they were as low as 19th place as recently as January and 20th for a part of the season. Having made their worst start to a league season in their 126 year history, Tottenham made a three place improvement on the 2007–08 season.
