The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that exercises authority over the security of the traveling public in the United States.49 USC § 114(d)
The TSA was created as part of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, sponsored by Don Young in the United States House of Representatives[tpl]cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:HR03150: |title=THOMAS |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |accessdate=2012-01-16[/tpl] and Ernest Hollings in the Senate,[tpl]cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:S.1447: |title=THOMAS |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |accessdate=2012-01-16[/tpl] passed by the 107th U.S. Congress, and signed into law by President George W.

==History and organization==

The TSA was created as a response to the September 11, 2001, attacks. Its first administrator, John Magaw, was nominated by President Bush on December 10, 2001, and confirmed by the Senate the following January. The agency's proponents, including Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, argued that only a single federal agency would better protect air travel than the private companies who operated under contract to single airlines or groups of airlines that used a given terminal facility.
The organization was charged with developing policies to protect U.S. transportation, especially in airport security and the prevention of aircraft hijacking.
With state, local, and regional partners, the TSA oversees security for highways, railroads, buses, mass transit systems, pipelines and ports. However, the bulk of the TSA's efforts are in aviation security. The TSA is responsible for screening passengers and baggage at more than 450 U.S. airports.TSA Jobs
Private screening did not disappear under the TSA, which allows airports to opt out of federal screening and hire firms to do the job instead. Such firms must still get TSA approval under its Screening Partnership Program (SPP) and follow TSA procedures.[tpl]cite news|author= Greg fulton|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1228247,00.html |title=An Airport Screener's Complaint |publisher=Time.com |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=November 19, 2010[/tpl] Among the U.S. airports with privately operated checkpoints are San Francisco International Airport; Kansas City International Airport; Greater Rochester International Airport; Tupelo Regional Airport; Key West International Airport; Charles M.

==Administration==

TSA has had five administrators. They are John Magaw (2002), Admiral James Loy (2002–2003), Rear Admiral David M. Stone (2003–2005), Kip Hawley (2005–2009) and most recently John Pistole (2010–). Former TSA Deputy Administrator Gale Rossides served as TSA's Acting Administrator from early 2009 until Pistole's confirmation in the summer of 2010.[tpl]cite web|title= TSA Deputy Administrator To Retire |url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/ainalerts/2012-06-12/tsa-deputy-administrator-retire[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/25/AR2010062504490.html|title=John Pistole becomes TSA administrator; unions to seek collective-bargaining|last=Davidson|first=Joe|date=June 26, 2010|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl]

The TSA also oversees the Federal Flight Deck Officer program, which gives some pilots permission to carry firearms in the cockpit as a defense against hijackers.

===Uniforms===

In 2008, TSA officers began wearing new uniforms that have a blue-gray 65/35 polyester/cotton blend duty shirt, black pants, a wider black belt, and optional short-sleeved shirts and black vests (for seasonal reasons).TSA Management Directive No. 1100.73-2 – TSO Dress and Appearance Responsibilities Retrieved May 26, 2010. The first airport to introduce the new uniforms was Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Starting on September 11, 2008, all TSOs began wearing the new uniform. One stripe on each shoulder board denotes a TSO, two stripes a Lead TSO, and three a Supervisory TSO.
TSOs are issued badges similar to those carried by police officers, which has led to complaints from the latter group.[tpl]cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2008-06-15-tsa-badges_N.htm|title=TSA's new policelike badges a sore point with real cops|last=Frank|first=Thomas|date=June 16, 2008|work=USA Today|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl]

===2013 LAX shooting===

On Friday, November 1, 2013, TSA Agent Gerardo I. Hernandez, age 39, was shot and killed by a lone gunman at the Los Angeles International Airport. Law enforcement officials identified the suspect as 23-year-old Paul Anthony Ciancia who was shot and wounded by law enforcement officers before being taken into custody.[tpl]cite news|title=LAX shooting: Slain TSA agent identified as Gerardo I.

Hernandez is the first TSA agent to be killed in the line of duty.

==Funding==

For fiscal year 2012, the TSA had a budget of roughly $7.6 billion.
Part of the TSA budget comes from a $2.50 per-passenger tax. The Obama administration has proposed tripling this fee by 2019, with most of the increase going to reduce the national debt.TSA Fee Would Double Under New Proposal
Travelers left about half a million dollars behind at airport checkpoints in 2012 and 2013.Travelers leave $500,000 per year at TSA checkpoints On December 3, 2013, the House of Representatives passed the TSA Loose Change Act (H.R. 1095; 113th Congress).[tpl]cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House steals TSA's loose change|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/votes/191909-house-steals-tsas-loose-change|accessdate=3 December 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=3 December 2013[/tpl] If the bill were to become law, the TSA would no longer be allowed to keep the loose change left behind by travelers. Instead, the TSA would turn over the money to private charities that provide travel-related services to the members of the U.S. military and their families.[tpl]cite news|last=Thorp|first=Frank|title=House: Give loose change left at TSA gates to troop group|url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/03/21739176-house-give-loose-change-left-at-tsa-gates-to-troop-group?lite|accessdate=3 December 2013|newspaper=NBC News|date=3 December 2013[/tpl]

==Screening processes and regulations==

===Passenger and carry-on screening===

====Identification requirements====

The TSA requires that passengers show a valid ID at the security checkpoint before boarding their flight.  Valid forms of identification include passports from the U.S. or a foreign government, state-issued photo identification, or military ID. Passengers that do not have ID may still be allowed to fly if their identify can be verified through an alternate way.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/acceptable-ids | title=Acceptable IDs | publisher=Transportation Security Administration | work=tsa.gov | date=August 26, 2013 | accessdate=November 5, 2013[/tpl]
Passenger names are compared against the No-fly list, a list of about 21,000 names of suspected terrorists who are not allowed to board.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57370284/no-fly-list-doubles-in-a-year-now-21000-names/|title=No-fly list doubles in a year – now 21,000 names|date=February 2, 2012|work=CBS News|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] Passenger names are also compared against a longer list of "selectees", passengers whose names match names from this list receive a more thorough screening before being potentially allowed to board.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/TRAVEL/10/22/no.fly.lists/index.html|title=Terrorist watch lists shorter than previously reported|last=Alvarez|first=Lizette|date=October 22, 2008|work=CNN|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] The effectiveness of the lists has been widely criticized on the basis of errors in how those lists are maintained,[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/29/opinion/la-oe-schoenfeld29-2009dec29|title=Politics and the no-fly list|last=Schoenfeld|first=Gabriel|date=December 29, 2009|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] for concerns that the lists are unconstitutional, for contributing to racial profiling,[tpl]cite news|url=http://rt.com/usa/american-employee-list-no-fly-709/|title=American Airlines employee suspended after DHS put him on no-flight list with no apparent reason|date=: November 14, 2012|work=RT|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] and for its ineffectiveness at stopping Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to detonate plastic explosives in his underwear, from boarding an aircraft.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-12-31/news/0912310150_1_no-fly-list-umar-farouk-abdulmutallab-watch-list|title=Plane bombing plot: No-fly list procedure needs revamping, critics say|last=Tankersley,|first=Jim|date=December 31, 2009|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] 
At the airport security checkpoint, passengers are screened to ensure they are not carrying prohibited items. These include most sorts of sharp objects, many sporting goods such as baseball bats and hockey sticks, guns or other weapons, many sorts of tools, flammable liquids (except for conventional lighters), many forms of chemicals and paint.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/prohibited-items|title=Prohibited Items|publisher=Transportation Security Administration|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] In addition, passengers are limited to [tpl]convert|3.4|USoz|lk=in[/tpl] of almost any liquid or gel, which must be presented at the checkpoint in a clear, one-quart zip-top bag.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/3-1-1-carry-ons|title=3-1-1 for Carry-ons|publisher=Transportation Security Administration|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] These restrictions on liquids were a reaction to the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot.
In some cases, government leaders, members of the US military and law-enforcement officials are allowed to bypass security screening.[tpl]cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/federal-eye/2010/11/who_is_exempt_from_airport_sec.html|title=Who is exempt from airport security?|last=O'Keefe|first=Ed|date=November 22, 2010|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=7 April 2013[/tpl]
In a program begun in October 2011, the TSA's Precheck Program allows selected members of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Alaska Airlines, US Airways, Hawaiian Airlines, Virgin America, Southwest Airlines and Air Canada frequent flyer programs, members of Global Entry, NEXUS, and SENTRI and active duty members of the US military[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] to receive expedited screening for domestic and select international itineraries.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/business/tsa-eases-security-for-chosen-fliers.html|title=ON THE ROAD; For the Chosen Fliers, Security Check Is a Breeze|last=Sharkey|first=Joe|date=8 November 2011|work=The New York Times|page=9|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] As of November 2013, this program was available at 100 airports.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tsa.gov/tsa-precheck/tsa-precheck-participating-airports|title=TSA Precheck Participating Airports[/tpl] Starting in Fall 2013, TSA plans to allow US citizens to apply for Precheck.

In October 2013, the TSA announced that it had begun searching a wide variety of government and private databases for information about passengers before they arrive at the airport. They did not say which databases were involved, but TSA has access to past travel itineraries, property records, physical characteristics, law enforcement and intelligence information, among others.Security Check Now Starts Long Before You Fly

====November 2010 enhanced screening procedures====

Beginning in November 2010, TSA added new enhanced screening procedures. Passengers are required to choose between an enhanced patdown, allowing TSOs to more thoroughly check areas on the body such as waistbands, groin, and inner thigh.[tpl]cite news | last = Sullivan | first = Eileen | authorlink = | coauthors = Laurie Kellman, Martin Crutsinger and Larry Margasak| url = http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101123/ap_on_bi_ge/us_airport_security_vips| work = | agency = Associated Press | date = November 23, 2010| title = TSA: Some gov't officials to skip airport security| doi = | accessdate = November 23, 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl] or instead to be imaged by the use of a full body scanner (that is, either backscatter X-ray or millimeter wave detection machines) in order to fly.

=====Full body scanners=====

In November 2010, the TSA began putting  backscatter X-ray scanners and millimeter wave scanners machines into airports.  The TSA refers to these two technologies as Advanced Imaging Technologies, or AIT. Critics sometimes refer to them as "naked scanners".Germany plans lab tests for airport "naked scans"

Full body scanners have also proven controversial due to privacy and health concerns.

=====Reactions=====

After the November 2010 initiation of enhanced screening procedures of all airline passengers and flight crews, the US Airline Pilots Association issued a press release stating that pilots should not submit to full body scanners because of unknown radiation risks and calling for strict guidelines for pat-downs of pilots, including  evaluation of their fitness for duty after the pat-down, given the stressful nature of pat-downs.Joe Sharkey, Screening Protests Grow as Holiday Crunch Looms, New York Times, November 15, 2010.President’s Message[tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl], US Airline Pilots Association press release, November 8, 2010.

In order to be able to search passenger baggage for security screening, the TSA will cut or otherwise disable locks they cannot open themselves.

In September 2012, ABC News interviewed former TSA agent Pythias Brown, who has admitted to stealing more than $800,000 worth of items during his employment with the agency.

The TSA has also been criticized for not responding properly to theft and failing to reimburse passengers for stolen goods. For example, between 2011 and 2012, passengers at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport reported $300,000 in property lost or damaged by the TSA.

===Unintended consequences of 2002 screening enhancements===

Two studies by a group of Cornell University researchers have found that strict airport security has the unintended consequence of increasing road fatalities, as would-be air travelers decide to drive and are exposed to the far greater risk of dying in a car accident. In 2005, the researchers looked at the immediate aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001, and found that the change in passenger travel modes led to 242 added driving deaths per month.[tpl]cite journal|last=Blalock|first=Garrick|coauthors=Vrinda Kadiyali, Daniel H. Simon|date=February 10, 2005|title=The Impact of 9/11 on Road Fatalities: The Other Lives Lost to Terrorism|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|issn=1556-5068|doi=10.2139/ssrn.677549|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=677549[/tpl] In all, they estimated that about 1,200 driving deaths could be attributed to the short-term effects of the attacks. The study attributes the change in traveler behavior to two factors: fear of terrorist attacks and the wish to avoid the inconvenience of strict security measures; no attempt is made to estimate separately the influence of each of these two factors.
In 2007, the researchers studied the specific effects of a change to security practices instituted by the TSA in late 2002. They concluded that this change reduced the number of air travelers by 6%, and estimated that consequently, 129 more people died in car accidents in the fourth quarter of 2002.[tpl]cite web|url=http://aem.cornell.edu/faculty_sites/gb78/wp/JLE_6301.pdf |title=AEM.cornell.edu |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-01-16[/tpl] Extrapolating this rate of fatalities, New York Times contributor Nate Silver remarked that this is equivalent to "four fully loaded Boeing 737s crashing each year."[tpl]cite news|last=Silver |first=Nate |url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/the-hidden-costs-of-extra-airport-security/?partner=rss&emc=rss |title=The Hidden Costs of Extra Security - NYTimes.com |publisher=Fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com |date= November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 19, 2010[/tpl] The 2007 study also noted that strict airport security hurts the airline industry; it was estimated that the 6% reduction in the number of passengers in the fourth quarter of 2002 cost the industry $1.1 billion in lost business.[tpl]cite journal|last=Blalock|first=Garrick|coauthors=Vrinda Kadiyali, Daniel H.

The TSA fixed the website several days after the press picked up the story.[tpl]cite news |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/02/homeland_securi.html |title=Homeland Security Website Hacked by Phishers? 15 Signs Say Yes |accessdate=June 16, 2007 |last=Singel |first=Ryan |date=February 14, 2007 |work=Threat Level[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Wired News [/tpl] The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform investigated the matter,[tpl]cite web |url=http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070223122534-10589.pdf |format=PDF|title=Letter Requesting Documents from TSA: Oversight Committee Requests Information on TSA Traveler Identity Verification Website |accessdate=June 16, 2007 |last=Waxman |first=Henry |date=February 23, 2007 |work=House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070328233646/http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070223122534-10589.pdf  |archivedate = March 28, 2007[/tpl] and said the website had operated insecurely for more than four months, during which more than 247 people had submitted personal information.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tsa.dhs.gov/press/happenings/tsa_site.shtm |title=Background on Committee Report Regarding TSA's Redress Web Site |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |date=January 11, 2008 |publisher=Transportation Security Administration[/tpl] The report said the TSA manager who awarded the contract for creating the website was a high-school friend and former employee of the owner of the firm that received the contract.[tpl]cite news |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/01/cronyism-led-to.html |title=Vulnerable TSA Website Exposed by Threat Level Leads to Cronyism Charge |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |last=Singel |first=Ryan |date=January 11, 2008 |work=Wired News[/tpl] It noted:  neither Desyne nor the technical lead on the traveler redress Web site have been sanctioned by TSA for their roles in the deployment of an insecure Web site. TSA continues to pay Desyne to host and maintain two major Web-based information systems. TSA has taken no steps to discipline the technical lead, who still holds a senior program management position at TSA.[tpl]cite web |url=http://oversight.house.gov/story.asp?ID=1680 |title=Chairman Waxman Releases Report on Information Security Breach at TSA's Traveler Redress Website |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |date=January 11, 2008 |publisher=United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080131042333/http://oversight.house.gov/story.asp?ID=1680  |archivedate = January 31, 2008[/tpl] 
In December 2009, someone within the TSA posted a sensitive manual entitled “Screening Management SOP” on secret airport screening guidelines to an obscure URL on the FedBizOpps website. The manual was taken down quickly, but the breach raised questions about whether security practices had been compromised. Five TSA employees were placed on administrative leave over the manual’s publication, which, while redacted, had its redaction easily removed by computer-knowledgeable people.

On December 3, 2013, the United States House of Representatives passed the Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act (H.R. 2719; 113th Congress) in response to criticism of the TSA's acquisition process as wasteful, costly, and ineffective.[tpl]cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House to push tech reform at TSA|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/technology/191721-house-to-push-tech-reform-at-tsa|accessdate=4 December 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Bipartisan Legislation Introduced to Reform TSA's Acquisition Process|url=http://homeland.house.gov/press-release/bipartisan-legislation-introduced-reform-tsa-s-acquisition-process|publisher=Committee on Homeland Security of the US House of Representatives|accessdate=4 December 2013[/tpl] If the bill became law, it would require the TSA to develop a comprehensive technology acquisition plan and present regular reports to Congress about its successes and failures to adhere to this plan. An April 2013 report from the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General indicated that the TSA had 17,000 items with an estimated cost of $185.7 million stored in its warehouses on May 31, 2012.[tpl]cite web|last=Richards|first=Anne L.|title=Transportation Security Administration Logistics Center - Inventory Management|url=http://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2013/OIG_13-82_Apr13.pdf|publisher=Office of Inspector General - Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=4 December 2013|date=April 26, 2013[/tpl] The auditors found that "TSA stored unusable or obsolete equipment, maintained inappropriate safety stock levels, and did not develop an inventory management process that systematically deploys equipment."
In January 2014 Jason Edward Harrington, a former TSA screener at O'Hare International Airport, said that fellow staff members assigned to review body scan images of airline passengers routinely joked about fliers' weight, attractiveness, and penis and breast sizes. According to Harrington, screeners would alert each other to attractive female passengers with the code phrase "Hotel Papa" so that staff would have an opportunity to view the passengers' nude form in body scanner monitors, and retaliated against rude flyers by delaying them at the checkpoint. TSA Administrator John Pistole responded by saying that all the scanners had been replaced and the screening rooms disabled. He did not deny that the behaviors described by Harrington took place.[tpl]cite web|title='New TSA in town,' agency says in response to screener's charges|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/31/22527381-new-tsa-in-town-agency-says-in-response-to-screeners-charges?lite&lite=obinsite|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=4 December 2013[/tpl]
