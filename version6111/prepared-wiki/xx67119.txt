Leicester City Football Club [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|s|t|ər|_|ˈ|s|ɪ|t|i[/tpl], also known as The Foxes, is an English professional football club based in Leicester at The King Power Stadium (commonly known as Filbert Way) [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/kingpowerstadium/|title=Walkers Stadium |year=2004|work=The Stadium Guide website|publisher=The Stadium Guide|accessdate=31 October 2013[/tpl] They currently play in the Football League Championship, having been promoted as champions from Football League One in the 2008–09 season. Leicester City will be promoted to the Premier League for the 2014–2015 campaign.
The club was founded in 1884 as Leicester Fosse,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lcfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10274,00.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090621091515/http://www.lcfc.com/page/History/0,,10274,00.html |archivedate=21 June 2009 |title=The History of Leicester City Football Club |publisher= Leicester City Official Website|accessdate=31 October 2013[/tpl] playing on a field near Fosse Road. They moved to Filbert Street in 1891 and played there for 111 years,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filbertstreet.net/filbert.php3 |title=A History of Filbert Street |publisher=Filbertstreet.net |accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl] before relocating to the nearby Walkers Stadium in 2002.
Leicester were elected to the Football League in 1894. The club's highest ever finish was second place in the top flight, in Division One in 1928–29. The club holds a joint-highest seven second tier titles (six Second Division and one Championship), as well as one League One title. They have won the League Cup three times and have been FA Cup runners-up four times, a tournament record for the most defeats in the final without having won the competition. The club has only spent one season outside the top two tiers of English football.

Leicester's first ever Football League game was a 4–3 defeat at Grimsby Town, with a first League win the following week, against Rotherham United at Filbert Street. The same season also saw the club's largest win to date, a 13–0 victory over Notts Olympic in an FA Cup qualifying game. In 1907–08 the club finished as Second Division runners-up, gaining promotion to the First Division, the highest level of English football. However, the club were relegated after a single season which included the club's record defeat, a 12–0 loss against Nottingham Forest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=1271|title=Final 1908/1909 English Division 1 (old) Table|work=Football DataCo Limited|accessdate=31 October 2013[/tpl]
In 1919, when League football resumed after World War I, Leicester Fosse ceased trading due to financial difficulties of which little is known. The club was reformed as "Leicester City Football Club", particularly appropriate as the borough of Leicester had recently been given city status. Following the name change, the club enjoyed moderate success in the 1920s; under the management of Peter Hodge, who left in May 1926 to be replaced two months later by Willie Orr, and with record goalscorer Arthur Chandler in the side,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=1527&teamTabs=records |title=All Time Leicester Records & Achievements |publisher=Soccerbase.com |accessdate=2013-10-31[/tpl] they won the Division Two title in 1924–25[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/leicester-city/1924-1925/table |title=Leicester City 1924–1925 : English Division Two (old) Table |publisher=Statto.com |accessdate=2013-10-31[/tpl] and recorded their highest ever league finish in 1928–29 as runners-up by a single point to Sheffield Wednesday.

Under the management of Matt Gillies and his assistant Bert Johnson, Leicester reached the FA Cup final on another two occasions, but lost in both 1961 and 1963. As they lost to double winners Tottenham in 1961, they were England's representatives in the 1961–62 European Cup Winners' Cup. In the 1962–63 season, the club reached as high as first place in the First Division, thanks to a sensational run of form on icy and frozen pitches the club became nicknamed The Ice Kings eventually placed fourth, the club's best post-war finish. Gillies collected silverware in 1964, when Leicester beat Stoke 4–3 on aggregate to win the League Cup for the first time. Leicester also reached the League Cup final the following year, but lost 3–2 on aggregate to Chelsea. Gillies and Johnson became hugely influential on English football for their version of the "whirl" and the "switch" system which utterly upset the traditional 1–11 formations in England.[tpl]cite news|title=The forgotten story of ...

His successor, Frank O'Farrell was unable to prevent relegation, but the club reached the FA Cup final in 1969 for the last time to date, losing to Manchester City 1–0.
In 1971, Leicester were promoted back to Division One, and won the Charity Shield for the only time. Unusually, due to Division One champions Arsenal's commitments in European competition, Division Two winners Leicester were invited to play FA Cup runners up Liverpool, beating them 1–0. Jimmy Bloomfield was appointed for the new season, and his team remained in the First Division for his tenure. No period since Bloomfield has seen the club remain in the top division for so long. Leicester reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1973–74.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kBAQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wpADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5919,1069364&dq=leicester+fa+cup+semi-final|title=Liverpool in 5th Cup Final|date=5 April 1975|work=The Age|page=26 |accessdate=16 September 2009[/tpl]
Frank McLintock, a noted player for seven years for Leicester successful period from the late Fifties to the mid Sixties, succeeded Jimmy Bloomfield in 1977. City was relegated at the end of the 1977–78 season and McLintock resigned. Jock Wallace resumed the tradition of successful Scottish managers (after Peter Hodge and Matt Gillies) by steering Leicester to the Division Two championship in 1980.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Kq4TAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mY4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5450,1043042&dq=leicester+championship|title=Liverpool finally get something|date=8 May 1980|work=New Straights Times|page=30|accessdate=17 September 2009[/tpl] Unfortunately, Wallace was unable to keep Leicester in Division One, but they reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1982. Under Wallace, one of City's most famous home-grown players, Gary Lineker, emerged into the first team squad. Leicester's next manager was Gordon Milne, who achieved promotion in 1983. Lineker helped Leicester maintain their place in the First Division but was sold to Everton in 1985 and two years later Leicester were relegated, having failed to find a suitable replacement. Milne left in 1986 and was replaced in 1987 by David Pleat, who was sacked in January 1991 after a defeat that left City fourth from bottom. Gordon Lee was put in charge of the club until the end of the season. Leicester won their final game of the season, which guided them clear of relegation to the third tier of the football league.
Brian Little took over in 1991 and by the end of the 1991–92 season Leicester had reached the playoff final for promotion to the newly formed Premiership, losing to Blackburn Rovers. The club also reached the playoff final the following year, losing 4–3 to Swindon Town, having come back from 3–0 down. In 1993–94 City were promoted from the playoffs, beating Derby County 2–1 in the final. Little quit as Leicester manager the following November to take charge at Aston Villa, and his successor Mark McGhee was unable to save Leicester from finishing second from bottom in the 1994–95 season. McGhee left the club unexpectedly in December 1995 whilst Leicester were top of Division One to take charge of Wolverhampton Wanderers.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/mcghee-the-new-man-at-molineux-1525726.html|title= McGhee the new man at Molineux |date=14 December 1995|work=The Independent|accessdate=16 September 2009 | location=London[/tpl]
McGhee was replaced by Martin O'Neill. Under O'Neill, Leicester qualified for the 1995–96 Division One promotion playoffs and beat Crystal Palace 2–1 with a last-gasp Steve Claridge goal securing an immediate return to the Premiership. Following promotion, Leicester established themselves in the Premiership with four successive top ten finishes. O'Neill was the first manager to win silverware for 26 years, winning the League Cup twice, in 1997 and 2000, and Leicester were runners-up in 1999. Thus the club qualified for the UEFA Cup in 1997–98 and 2000–01, the club's first European competition since 1961. In June 2000 O'Neill was lured to Celtic.
O'Neill was replaced by former England U-21 coach Peter Taylor. During this time, Leicester's last European appearance ended in a 3–1 defeat to Red Star Belgrade on 28 September 2000 in the 2001 UEFA Cup.Red Star end Leicester dreams, BBC Sport 2000-09-28. Retrieved on 27 September 2007. After a long run of poor results, Taylor was sacked in October 2001. Taylor was replaced by a management team of Dave Bassett and Micky Adams, but they could not prevent City's last season at Filbert Street ending in relegation from the Premiership.
Leicester moved into the new 32,500-seat Walkers Stadium at the start of the 2002–03 season. Walkers, the Leicestershire based crisp manufacturers, acquired the naming rights for a ten-year period.[tpl]cite web|url=http://talkingballs.co.uk/showthread.php/2818-Questions-for-Mr-Davies?p=51973#post51973 |title=Statement by the Foxes Trust on an unofficial forum |publisher=Talkingballs.co.uk |date=24 November 2004 |accessdate=2013-10-31[/tpl] In October 2002, the club went into administration with debts of £30 million. Some of the reasons were the loss of TV money (ITV Digital, itself in administration, had promised money to First Division clubs for TV rights), the large wage bill, lower than expected fees for players transferred to other clubs and the £37 million cost of the new stadium.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2349397.stm | work=BBC News | title=Leicester City put into administration | date=22 October 2002[/tpl] Adams was banned from the transfer market for most of the season, even after the club was rescued by a takeover by a consortium led by Gary Lineker. Adams guided Leicester to runners-up spot in Division One and automatic promotion back to the Premiership with more than 90 points. Leicester only lasted one season in the top flight and were relegated back to the newly labelled Championship, previously known as Division One.
When Adams resigned as manager in October 2004 Craig Levein was appointed boss. This would prove to be an unsuccessful period and after 15 months in charge and flirting with relegation Levein was sacked. Assistant manager Rob Kelly, took over as caretaker manager, and after winning three out of four games was appointed to see out the rest of the season. Kelly steered Leicester to safety and in April 2006 was given the manager's job on a permanent basis.
In October 2006 ex-Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandarić was quoted as saying he was interested in buying the club, reportedly at a price of around £6 million with the current playing squad valued at roughly £4.2 million. The takeover was formally announced on 13 February 2007.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6355687.stm|title= Mandarić seals Leicester takeover |date=13 February 2007|work=BBC Sport |accessdate=31 October 2013[/tpl] On 11 April 2007, Rob Kelly was sacked as manager and Nigel Worthington appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. Worthington saved the club from relegation, but was not offered the job on a permanent basis. On 25 May 2007 the club announced former MK Dons manager Martin Allen as their new manager with a three-year contract. Allen's relationship with Mandarić became tense and after only four games Allen left by mutual consent on 29 August 2007. On 13 September 2007, Mandarić announced Gary Megson as the new manager of the club, citing Megson's "wealth of experience" as a deciding factor in the appointment. However, Megson left on 24 October 2007 after only six weeks in charge, following an approach made for his services by Bolton Wanderers. Mandarić placed Frank Burrows and Gerry Taggart in the shared position as caretaker managers until a professional manager was appointed.
On 22 November, Ian Holloway was appointed manager. Holloway made history when he became the first Leicester manager in over 50 years to win his first league game in charge, beating Bristol City 2–0.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/bristol-city-0-leicester-city-2-flexible-fleming-makes-successful-start-760531.html|title= Bristol City 0 Leicester City 2: 'Hollywood' Holloway makes successful start|last=Nickless|first=Graham|date=26 November 2007|work=The Independent|accessdate=16 September 2009 | location=London[/tpl] Despite this, Leicester were relegated from the Championship at the end of the 2007–08 season after drawing 0–0 with Stoke City, marking the 2008–09 season as Leicester's first season outside the top two tiers of English football. Their fall from grace would also see Holloway leave by mutual consent after less than a season at the club, being replaced by Nigel Pearson. The club returned to the Championship at the first attempt, finishing as champions of League One after a 2–0 win at Southend United with 2 games in hand. The 2009–2010 season saw Leicester's revival under Pearson continue, as the club finished 5th and reached the Championship play-offs in their first season back in the second tier. Though after a battling performance coming from 2–0 down on aggregate, away to Cardiff City, to briefly lead 3–2, they eventually lost to a penalty shoot-out in the play-off semi-final. On Tuesday 29 June 2010, it was confirmed that Nigel Pearson had left Leicester to become the manager of Hull City because he felt that the club seemed reluctant to keep him, and that Paulo Sousa had been the club's guest at both play-off games, hinting at a possible replacement. On Wednesday 7 July 2010, Paulo Sousa was confirmed as Pearson's replacement.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8793219.stm|title= Sousa confirmed as new Leicester boss|date=7 July 2010|work=BBC Sport |accessdate=31 October 2013[/tpl]

Pearson would go on to lead The Foxes to a 6th place finish in the 2012–2013 season, ensuring Leicester City were in the Championship play off's after a last gasp 3–2 away win at local rivals Nottingham Forest. However they would go on to lose out in the play off semi final 3–2 on aggregate to Watford after Anthony Knockaert missed a late penalty and Troy Deeney scored right at the end after a swift counterattack from a Manuel Almunia double save .
In April 2014, a 2–1 win over Sheffield Wednesday, combined with losses by Queens Park Rangers and Derby County, allowed Leicester City to clinch a promotion to the Premier League after a 10 year absence.
On 22 April 2014, a 1-0 victory over Bolton Wanderers FC at the Reebok Stadium saw Leicester become the champions of the 2013-14 Championship.

==Colours, crest & traditions==

The club's home colours of royal blue and white have been used for the team's kits throughout most of its history.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Leicester_City/Leicester_City.htm|title=Leicester City|publisher=Historical Football Kits|accessdate=17 September 2009[/tpl] The first sponsorship logo to appear on a Leicester shirt was that of Ind Coope in 1983. British snack food manufacturer Walkers Crisps held a long association with the club, sponsoring them from 1987 to 2001.
An image of a fox was first incorporated into the club crest in 1948, as Leicestershire is known for foxes and fox hunting.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lcfc.com/news/article/180712-city-shirts-a-potted-history-248065.aspx |title=City Shirts – A Potted History | first=John | last=Hutchinson |publisher=LCFC.com |date=18 July 2012|accessdate=31 October 2013[/tpl] This is the origin of the nickname "The Foxes". The club mascot is a character called "Filbert Fox". There are also secondary characters "Vickie Vixen" and "Cousin Dennis". The current shirt badge has been used since 1992. In the 2009–10 season which was the 125th year anniversary the home kit featured no sponsor and a new central crest with "125 Years" below. The crest was slightly changed, this change included the fox in the crest to have a white area under its nose. The circles in the crest were also moved around.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Leicester-City-unveil-new-home-kit/story-12036491-detail/story.html|title=Leicester City unveil new home kit|date=25 April 2009|work=Leicester Mercury|accessdate=31 October 2013[/tpl]
In another reference Leicestershire's tradition of hunting, the club adopted the 'Post Horn Gallop' in 1941, although the origin is a 19th-century coachman's tune to signal mail was arriving.Official History DVD, 00:32:00 It was played over the PA system as the teams came out of the tunnel at all home games. However the club since replaced it with a jazzed-up modern version, although now it is played live on pitch before the teams emerge from the tunnel.

==Stadium==

In their early years, Leicester played at numerous grounds, but have only played at two since they joined the Football League. When first starting out they played on a field by the Fosse Road,[tpl]Cite book|last=Inglis |first=Simon |title=The Football Grounds of Great Britain (2nd ed.) |publisher=Collins Willow |location=London |year=1987 |isbn = 0-00-218249-1|page=136[/tpl] hence the original name Leicester Fosse. They moved from there to Victoria Park, and subsequently to Belgrave Road. Upon turning professional the club moved to Mill Lane. After eviction from Mill Lane the club played at the County Cricket ground while seeking a new ground. The club secured the use of an area of ground by Filbert Street, and moved there in 1891.
Some improvements by noted football architect Archibald Leitch occurred in the Edwardian era, and in 1927 a new two tier stand was built, named the Double Decker, a name it would keep till the ground's closure in 2002. The ground wasn't developed any further, apart from compulsory seating being added, till 1993 when work began on the new Carling Stand. The stand was impressive while the rest of the ground was untouched since at least the 1920s; this led manager Martin O'Neill to say he used to "lead new signings out backwards" so they only saw the Carling Stand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/095235361X |title=Author notes on Farewell to Filbert Street |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl]

==Managerial history==

Up until Peter Hodge was hired after World War I, the club had no official manager. A nominal role of secretary/manager was employed, though the board and the selection committee took control of most team affairs. It was Hodge who instated a system at the club for the manager having complete control over player and staff recruitment, team selection and tactics. Though Hodge was originally also titled "secretary/manager" he has retrospectively been named as the club's first official "manager".[tpl]Cite book|author=Dave Smith & Paul Taylor|title=Of Fossils and Foxes|year=2010|isbn=1-905411-94-4[/tpl]
Leicester have had a total of 9 permanent secretary/managers and 34 permanent managers (not including caretakers). Current manager Nigel Pearson and Peter Hodge have both had two separate spells in charge the club. Dave Bassett also had a second spell as caretaker manager after his spell as permanent manager.
