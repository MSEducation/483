==Brief information==

The software contains numerous Japanese recipes with step by step instructions, and the user can use the Nintendo DS's microphone for voice-recognition commands like turning pages. All the instructions are read out loud, while some instructions are video recordings showing how to do some tasks like chopping. It is possible to choose recipes based on a number of calories, the ingredients the user has and so forth. The simulator also keeps in memory what dishes the player has already made. It also features a timer, useful when on is cooking noodles and the like; however, some kitchen appliances already have built-in timers, like kitchen stoves and microwave ovens for example. As a bonus, the Game & Watch game, Chef, can also be played in this DS title.
