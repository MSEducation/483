CATEGORIES: 2003 elections in Canada, Elections in Saskatchewan

The Saskatchewan general election of 2003 was the twenty-fifth provincial election held in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It was held on November 5, 2003, to elect the 58 members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan (MLAs). The election was called on October 8 by Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan Lynda Haverstock, on the advice of Premier Lorne Calvert.

==Campaign==

Going into the election, the popularity of the New Democratic Party of Saskatchewan (NDP) had declined because of controversy on a number of issues. Voters in this agrarian province were disgruntled because of a mediocre harvest, a disastrous summer for cattle producers – the American border had been closed to Canadian beef due to fears of mad cow disease, and the actions of a member of the NDP Cabinet who was found to have misled the people of the province on the nature of the Saskatchewan Potato Utility Development Company ("SPUDCO"), a publicly owned potato company that was inappropriately characterized as a public-private partnership.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prairiecentre.com/pdf/spudco_chronology.pdf|title=‘SPUDCO’ CHRONOLOGY|publisher=Prairie Policy Centre|date=2009-09-11|accessdate=2009-09-11[/tpl]
Election issues included emigration (the province's population was falling because young people were leaving the province to look for work), honesty and integrity, privatization of public transit and energy supplies, and utility rates.
During the campaign, the NDP was attacked for an internal cartoon that had been leaked to the media. It depicted Saskatchewan Party leader Elwin Hermanson directing persons labeled 'NDP sympathizers' onto railway boxcars. The cartoon referred to speculation that, if elected, Hermanson would replace civil servants who were NDP supporters with Saskatchewan Party supporters. However, many associated it with the Holocaust – in particular Nazi Germany's deportation of Jews to concentration camps.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2003/10/14/cartoon031014.html | work=CBC News | title=Sask.

The campaign as a whole was seen as being quite negative, as the NDP constantly claimed that the Saskatchewan Party had a 'secret agenda' to privatize crown corporations to finance large tax cuts for business; the Saskatchewan Party had a difficult time refuting these claims, as several party members made comments that seemed consistent with this view.
Unlike many of the other provincial elections held in 2003, the election was widely regarded as too close to call up until a large proportion of the polls had reported. To the surprise of observers who believed the NDP would be affected by the poor pre-election conditions, the NDP won its fourth term in government.  It actually picked up the one seat it needed for a bare majority. All of its cabinet ministers were re-elected; except for two who had defected to the party from the Liberals.
After Elwin Hermanson proved unable to lead his party to power, he resigned as leader on November 18, 2003.
Although speculation was high that they could form the balance of power in the case of a minority government, the Liberals lost their one seat.
