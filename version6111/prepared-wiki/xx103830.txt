[[Red Bull Trolley Grand Prix]]

CATEGORIES: Racing sports, Red Bull sports events, Sport in Auckland

The Red Bull Trolley Grand Prix is a novelty downhill race for unpowered vehicles sponsored by caffeinated drink manufacturer Red Bull. It is held in odd numbered years in the city of Auckland, New Zealand. 
The gravity-only powered racers compete on a 700m downhill racetrack through the Auckland Domain. Vehicles must weigh less than 80kg, and be no larger than 3m long by 1.5m wide by 2m high. Teams are expected to build trolleys to a theme and must perform a one minute song/dance/skit before the race commences.
Scores are allocated for originality of concept, speed down the course and quality of performance (including spectacularity of crashes). Races compete in pairs but elapsed time is the only speed criteria considered. Winners were awarded a trip for the whole team to the Melbourne Formula One Grand Prix motor race, or up to NZ$10,000 in other years.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/whitford/news/article.cfm?l_id=379&objectid=10010670 |title=Best of the weekend |date=12 February 2005 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=5 November 2011[/tpl]
