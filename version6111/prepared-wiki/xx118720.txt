In March 1850 aged 15, Wolff left Hamburg to live in Liverpool with his uncle, Gustav Christian Schwabe, a financier. Wolff was educated at Liverpool College; afterwards he served an apprenticeship at the engineers

After serving his apprenticeship, Wolff was employed by the B. Goodfellow Ltd., a firm based in Hyde, Greater Manchester as a draughtsman. In 1857, due to the intervention of his uncle Gustav Christian Schwabe, Wolff was employed as Edward Harland's personal assistant at Robert Hickson's shipyard at Queen's Island, Belfast.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/northern_ireland/ni_9/article_2.shtml |title=BBC Legacies - Work - Northern Ireland - The Yard – Article 2|accessdate=2008-03-27 |year=2004 |work=BBC Legacies |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation[/tpl] In 1860, Edward Harland recruited Wolff as his business partner, and Harland and Wolff was formed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t245.e829 |title=Harland, Sir Edward James|accessdate=2008-03-27 |author=Frank Geary |year=2004 |work=The Oxford Companion to Irish History |publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t110.e2023&srn=1&ssid=970934128#FIRSTHIT |title=Harland, Edward James|accessdate=2008-03-27 |author=Alvin Jackson |year=1997 |work=Oxford Companion to British History|publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37511 |title=Harland, Sir Edward James, baronet (1831-1895)|accessdate=2008-03-27 |author=Michael S.

==Career at Harland and Wolff==

Wolff's early role at Harland and Wolff involved his engineering and managing the yard. Due to Wolff's German Jewish descent,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t110.e4566&srn=2&ssid=197680775#FIRSTHIT|title=Wolff, Gustav Wilhelm|accessdate=2008-03-27 |author=Alvin Jackson |year=1997 |work=Oxford Companion to British History|publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl] he had links with the Jewish community in Hamburg and in Britain, and was able to attract business to the shipyard. Wolff worked extensively at the yard, and was partly responsible for building of the engine works at Harland and Wolff in 1880.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scarboroughcivicsociety.org.uk/page8.html |title=Scarborough & District Civic Society 2001 Blue Plaque - Sir Edward James Harland |accessdate=2008-03-27 |author=Tony Stephens |publisher=Scarborough & District Civic Society[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] More notably, his company was the first to begin construction of the RMS Titanic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic |title=RMS Titanic -  |accessdate=2010-07-08 |author=Steven Wolff[/tpl] After the conversion of Harland and Wolff to limited company status in 1888, Wolff was appointed as a director. Wolff  was able to secure a good relationship with the Hamburg America Line, which was managed by Albert Ballin, a fellow Jew. Wolff officially retired from Harland and Wolff in 1906, although he had not been an active in the business for years beforehand. William James Pirrie who became a partner in 1874 was now the most active. Wolff claimed of the business relationship at Harland and Wolff:[tpl]quote|Sir Edward Harland builds the ships, Mr Pirrie makes the speeches, and, as for me, I smoke the cigars.|Gustav Wilhelm Wolff|[/tpl]

==Outside interests and later life==

Wolff had business interests outside Harland and Wolff, including the Belfast Ropeworks, which he founded in the early 1870s with W.H. Smiles, who was the son of Samuel Smiles, a Scottish author. With Wolff as chairman, the firm became one of the largest ropeworks in the world, challenging the Gourock Ropework Company, who were based on the River Clyde in Scotland. Wolff also bought shares in the Union Steamship Company, and became a director; with his influence, he ensured Harland and Wolff received regular orders from the Union Steamship Company. After Wolff's negotiation, the Union Steamship Company merged in 1900 with the Castle Line, which was owned by Donald Currie; the new company formed was the Union-Castle Line. Outside business, Gustav Wolff served as a Belfast harbour commissioner from 1887 to 1893. Wolff, like Edward Harland, served as a Member of Parliament as a member of the Conservative and Unionist Party. Edward Harland and Gustav Wolff were known in the House of Commons as "Majestic" and "Teutonic", the names of two ships that the company built. Wolff was the Member of Parliament for Belfast East from March 1892 to December 1910. He replaced Edward de Cobain who had been expelled from the House of Commons and was later jailed for homosexual offences. Wolff only faced election once; in the 1892 by-election Sir William Charley, Q.C., stood against Wolff as an Independent Conservative. Wolff defeated Charley by a margin of over 2100 votes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/item/3438/ |title=The Times obituary of Gustav Wilhelm Wolff|date=1913-04-18|accessdate=2008-03-27 |publisher=Encyclopedia Titanica[/tpl] Wolff was then returned unopposed until his retirement from parliament in 1910. Afterwards, Wolff was made a freeman of Belfast by the Belfast Corporation. In Parliament, Wolff strongly opposed the Irish Home Rule bills. Despite Wolff's Jewish heritage, he was a member of the Church of Ireland. He also gave money to local causes, including the Ulster Hospital and the Orange Order. Wolff was a member of many different clubs, including the Carlton Club and the Garrick Club. After his retirement from parliament Wolff lived almost exclusively in London, where he died on 17 April 1913 at his home, 42 Park Street. Wolff did not marry and died a bachelor.
