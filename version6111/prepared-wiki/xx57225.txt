[[Tuna salad]]

CATEGORIES: Salads, Tuna dishes

Tuna salad is typically a blend of two main ingredients: tuna and mayonnaise or mayonnaise-substitute. The tuna used is usually pre-cooked, canned, and packaged in water or oil. Pickles, hard-boiled egg, celery, relish, and onion are ingredients that are often added. When the spread is placed on bread, it makes a tuna salad sandwich. Tuna salad is also regularly served on top of lettuce, tomato, avocado, or crackers, or by itself. 
Quick homemade tuna salad is often made by omitting the eggs and only adding relish.  Eggs are omitted because they must be cooked whereas the other ingredients are purchased ready to eat. Relish adds a piquant flavor but, unlike commonly added vegetables, requires no chopping.
In Belgium, the dish pÃªches au thon / perziken met tonijn is made from halved canned or fresh peaches stuffed with tuna salad.
In the United States, tuna salad is sometimes made with a mashed avocado and a squeeze of lemon instead of mayonnaise as a healthier alternative in Tuna salad.
