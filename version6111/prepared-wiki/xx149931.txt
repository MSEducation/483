CATEGORIES: Forms of government, Political metaphors, States by power status

A rump state is the remnant of a once-larger state, left with a reduced territory in the wake of secession, annexation, irredentism, occupation, decolonization, or a successful coup d'etat or revolution on part of its former territory.Tir, J. , 2005-02-22  "Keeping the Peace After Secessions: Territorial Conflicts Between Rump and Secessionist States" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, Hilton Hawaiian Village, Honolulu, Hawaii Online . 2009-05-25 from http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p72056_index.html In the latter case, a government stops short of going in exile because it still controls part of its former territory. For example, after the Qing government assumed control over most of China, the original Ming regime turned to resistance in the south until its eventual conquest.
