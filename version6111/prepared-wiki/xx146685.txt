==History==

The Réseau Guerlédan was [tpl]convert|5|km|mi[/tpl] in length, laid to a gauge of [tpl]convert|12+1/4|in|mm[/tpl], it ran along an abandoned metre gauge trackbed of the Réseau Breton (RB). Statutory powers to operate the line were inherited from the RB because lengths of rail had been left in place where there had formerly been level crossings. With the opening of the line, the Réseau Guerlédan became the smallest (in terms of track gauge) public railway in the world, taking the title from the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.[tpl]cite book| first = Brian| last = Hollingsworth| year = 1982| title = Railways of the World| publisher = W H Smith| location = London| isbn = 0-86124-023-5| page = 54[/tpl] A fleet of British built steam locomotives, based on famous narrow gauge designs were produced for use on the line, however only two steam locomotives saw service on the line.

==Closure==

The reason for the railway's closure was the occupation of the station at Caurel by the local mayor who subsequently let the facility to a member of his family. This seriously compromised the railway operation and as a result, the railway was cut back to terminate one kilometre from Caurel.
There is a myth that the railway was closed after a kidnap attempt on the owner's son and that the operating capital for the following season was employed in effecting his return. However, the son himself has stated that there is no truth in this story.

==Locomotives==

Four steam locomotives were built in the UK for the railway, all of which survive on the Fairbourne Railway. Only France and Jubilee were shipped to the Réseau Guerlédan - the remaining two were stored.
After closure, Jubilee, France, the Galloping Goose railcar and the rolling stock returned to the UK and were kept in storage until the Ellerton family purchased the Fairbourne Railway in North Wales in 1984. The stock has been in service there ever since.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.fairbournerailway.com/railway-history.htm| publisher=Fairbourne Railway| title=History| accessdate=March 14, 2008[/tpl] Jubilee was renamed Yeo[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lynton-barnstaple.cd2.com/gallery/66.htm| publisher=Lynton & Barnstable| title=the Fairbourne Railway L&B loco (scale 6" / 1ft)| accessdate=March 5, 2008[/tpl] and France was renamed Sherpa. Odd Job was left in France.

==Other locomotives==

These locomotives were built for the line, however were never shipped to France.

==Rolling stock==

The Réseau Guerlédan operated a number of carriages. As of 2011, three of these were located on the [tpl]RailGauge|15in[/tpl] Evesham Vale Light Railway in Warwickshire, United Kingdom.[tpl]cite journal |title=Evesham Vale up for sale. |first=Phil |last=Ashworth |journal=Heritage Railway |issue=148 |date=17 March – 13 April 2011 |page=p18 |publisher=Mortons Media Ltd |location=Horncastle[/tpl]
