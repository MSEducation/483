Pretties for You is the debut album by Alice Cooper. At this time, the name "Alice Cooper" referred to the band, not its lead singer, though the lead singer was also known as Alice Cooper. The music has a psychedelic flavor to it. The group had yet to develop the more concise hard rock sound that they would become known for. Most of the tracks from the album have a distinct loud and dynamic rock sound. However, very few songs have some sort of hard rock quality. Pretties For You was a critical and commercial failure, only briefly denting the Billboard Top 200, and none of its songs have ever been played live by Cooper since the release of his breakthrough album Love It to Death.Alice Cooper Tour Archive
The song "Reflected", Alice Cooper's first single, was later rewritten as "Elected" (which featured on their 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies). The band also performed during a party scene in the film Diary of a Mad Housewife(1970).personal experience (I saw the film during its original theatrical run) The artwork for this album was hanging on the wall of the living room in Frank Zappa's house.[tpl]cite web |url=http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?imgurl=ff002c907b64a1ff |title=LIFE: Musician Frank Zappa (R) w. parents (L-R... - Hosted by Google |publisher=Images.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26[/tpl] However, his wife Gail Zappa claims that it was later stolen from them.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zappa.com/gzsez/questions/alice-master-tapes/ |title=Re: Questions about Alice Master Tapes[/tpl] The original painting was done by Edward Beardsley.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/albums/a-pfy.php |title=Pretties For You |publisher=Sickthingsuk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26[/tpl]

==Track listing==

All songs written by Alice Cooper, Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway, and Neal Smith.

==Reception==

Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated Pretties for You three-and-a-half out of five stars. He stated that the album "was an earnest but flawed stab at psychedelia that occasionally caught fire." Lester Bangs of Rolling Stone delivered an unfavorable review. He explained that there are no "hints of life, spontaneity, joy, rage, or any kind of authentic passion or conviction." However, he stated that "within the context of Cooper's self-imposed limitations, the album is listenable." He concluded the review by saying that "Alice Cooper's music is, for this reviewer at any rate, totally dispensable."

==Personnel==

Among the keyboards played by Michael Bruce on this album is the mellotron, featured most prominently on "Titanic Overture". The mellotron was most likely hired out for this recording, as it is unlikely that the band used it on tours.
