Narelda Jacobs ia an Australia television journalist with Network Ten in Australia. She has been the lead news presenter for Ten News at Five in Perth, Western Australia since 2008.

==Career==

Jacobs graduated from the WA Academy of Performing Arts and began her career at GWN in Bunbury. She joined Ten News in Perth in 2000, eventually becoming their court reporter, and also filling in as weather presenter over summer.
In 2008, Network Ten announced that production of their Perth news bulletin would return to Perth from Sydney, and selected Jacobs as the new presenter. This decision was denied directly to the death of former newsreader Charmaine Dragun, as the initial decision to move the bulletin back to Perth was made well before her unexpected death on 2 November 2007.
Jacobs is the first Aboriginal, and first openly lesbian newsreader in Western Australia. She lives in Perth with her partner and teenage daughter.
