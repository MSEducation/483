Freising is a district in Bavaria, Germany. Following a recent ranking of the German magazine FOCUS MONEY comparing all German districts it is number one concerning economic growth abilities. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Kelheim, Landshut, Erding, Munich, Dachau and Pfaffenhofen.
The district is located north of the Munich metropolitan area. The Isar and Amper rivers run in parallel from southwest to northeast. North of the rivers there is the Hallertau, a hilly region mainly used for hop growing.
