Göteborgsvarvet is an annual half marathon running competition in Gothenburg,  Sweden (often called Göteborg half marathon in English). 
It is the largest annual running competition in Sweden, and the largest half-marathon running competition in the world, with its 62 000 entries for the most recent Goteborgsvarvet competition on 18 May 2013.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.goteborgsvarvet.se/Lopare/Nyheter/Arkiv/Aktuellt/GoteborgsVarvet-fullt/|title=Sold out in the GöteborgsVarvet Half Marathon |date=11 September 2012 |publisher=Göteborgsvarvet |accessdate=11 Sep 2012[/tpl] Its name is a play with words; the Swedish word "varv" has a double meaning and can mean both lap and shipyard, and Gothenburg has a history as a city of shipyards.
The race takes place in May, and has been organised annually since 1980. It starts outside, and finishes in, the old athletics arena Slottsskogsvallen in the Slottsskogen park. It takes off northwards over the large suspension bridge Älvsborg Bridge, follows the north bank to the Göta älv river, and returns over the Göta Älv Bridge, goes through the inner city, before reaching the finish.
The race has hosted the Swedish national championship race on four occasions (1995, 2007, 2009 and 2012).
