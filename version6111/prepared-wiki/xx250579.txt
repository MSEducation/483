His action at justice ministry during three years is considered as one of the most fruitful period for the judiciary and the promotion of draft laws in many fields (arbitrary detention, human rights, successions and wills, Lebanese citizenship for the generations of Lebanese ascent, the transformation of the justice ministry into a ministry for freedom and human rights). Najjar's tenure ended in June 2011, and was succeeded by Shakib Qortbawi as justice minister.[tpl]cite news|title=New justice minister says he will not engage in vengeful behavior|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2011/Jun-21/New-justice-minister-says-he-will-not-engage-in-vengeful-behavior.ashx#axzz2ODDb0hpR|accessdate=23 March 2013|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=21 June 2011|location=Beirut[/tpl]
