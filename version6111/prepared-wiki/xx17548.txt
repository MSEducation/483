Pareto efficiency, or Pareto optimality, is a state of allocation of resources in which it is impossible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off. The term is named after Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923), an Italian economist who used the concept in his studies of economic efficiency and income distribution.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] The concept has applications in academic fields such as economics and engineering.
Given an initial allocation of goods among a set of individuals, a change to a different allocation that makes at least one individual better off without making any other individual worse off is called a Pareto improvement. An allocation is defined as "Pareto efficient" or "Pareto optimal" when no further Pareto improvements can be made.
For example, suppose there are two consumers A & B and only one resource X. Suppose X is equal to 20. Let us assume that the resource has to be distributed equally between A and B and thus can be distributed in the following way: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,8), (9,9) and (10,10), which represent Pareto improvements. At point (10,10) all resources have been exhausted: no further distribution is possible—if redistribution continues, it will lead to a position (11,9) or (9,11) that makes one better off and the other worse off. Hence, point (10,10) is Pareto optimal; no further Pareto improvements can be made.
Pareto efficiency is a minimal notion of efficiency and does not necessarily result in a socially desirable distribution of resources: it makes no statement about equality, or the overall well-being of a society.[tpl]cite book |first=Nicholas |last=Barr |chapter=3.2.2 The relevance of efficiency to different theories of society |title=Economics of the Welfare State |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=DOg0BM1XiqQC&pg=PA46 |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-929781-8 |pages=46 |edition=5th[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |authorlink=Amartya Sen |first=Amartya |last=Sen |title=Markets and freedom: Achievements and limitations of the market mechanism in promoting individual freedoms |journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=519–541 |year=October 1993 |jstor=2663703 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos444/papers/sen.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl] The notion of Pareto efficiency can also be applied to the selection of alternatives in engineering and similar fields. Each option is first assessed under multiple criteria and then a subset of options is identified with the property that no other option can categorically outperform any of its members.
