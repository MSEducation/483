The Ministry of Justice (in French: Minist√®re de la Justice) is responsible for the administration of courts and prosecutors in Quebec, Canada. The Minister is automatically the Attorney General, and Registrar of Quebec.
On June 4, 1965, the Justice Department Act came into effect, making Quebec the first Canadian province to have a department of justice. The first Minister appointed under the new Act was Claude Wagner.
Prior to 1965, the senior justice official in the province was the Attorney General. This role was created in 1867 replacing the role of Attorney General of Canada East and before 1841 the Attorney General of Lower Canada.
