The Palace of Elisabeta (Palatul Elisabeta), in Bucharest, Romania, is currently the stately home of King Michael I of Romania.
The palace was designed in 1930 by the architect Marcu and built in 1936 for Princess Elisabeta, the former queen of Greece and sister of King Carol II. It was in this palace that King Michael was forced to abdicate on December 30, 1947. The palace is now the home of King Michael and Queen Anne since their return to Romania. Crown Princess Margarita and her husband Prince Radu also live there.
