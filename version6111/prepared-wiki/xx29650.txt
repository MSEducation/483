</ref> [[David A. Dodge]], the Deputy Finance Minister complained repeatedly to Martin throughout 1994 that the 3% target was meaningless as Canada did not plan to join the European Union, that it was unlikely to achieved with the current levels of cuts outlined in the 1994 budget, and would even if achieved would do nothing to help the economy.<ref name="Jeffrey-p265">Jeffrey, Brooke ''Divided Loyalties'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010, page 265.</ref> Accordingly, Dodge advocated far more drastic cuts, policy advice that both Martin ignored until late 1994 and Chrétien until early 1995.<ref name="Jeffrey-p265" /> Dodge had appointed deputy finance minister by Mulroney in 1992, and thus his views were something to the right of both Martin and Chrétien. In April 1994, interest rates in Canada started a steady rise that would continue until early 1995.<ref name="Jeffrey-p265" />
On 6 April 1994, the Rwandan genocide began. The government in Ottawa was kept well-informed about what was happening by diplomats and Canadian Forces serving as UN peacekeepers, but the genocide was not considered to be a major problem for Canada with the Chrétien government taking the view that other powers would stop the genocide. The government first insisted in April 1994 that there was only a civil war in Rwanda, and once it become clear that genocide had began, on 2 May 1994 Ouellet, speaking for the government in the House of Commons promised humanitarian aid and expressed the hope that the Organization for African Unity would do something to stop the genocide. In 2010, the Canadian government apologized to the people of Rwanda for indifference to the genocide of 1994.
Further adding to the financial pressure on the debt situation, in May 1994, Moody's downgraded Canada's debt, citing the high debt levels and concerns about a lack of political will to deal with the deficit. A vicious circle had been created. The underwhelming 1994 budget was taken as a sign that the Liberals were not serious about eliminating the deficit, which in turn created severe doubts amongst investors holding or considering buying government of Canada bonds that they would be repaid when the bonds matured. As a result, investors cease buying government of Canada bonds, which forced the Bank of Canada to raise the interest rates in order to attract buyers of Canada bonds. The raising interest rates, besides for hindering economic activity and thus hurting the government's ability to collect taxes, raised the costs of servicing the existing national debt, which in turn created further doubts amongst investors that they would be repaid, and thus started the circle all over again. As the vicious circle caused by the lack of investor confidence and raising interest rates continued into the fall of 1994, the 3% target became increasingly unlikely to be achieved, and thus Martin became more and more influenced by Dodge's advice that something more drastic needed to be done than achieving the 3% target.Jeffrey, Brooke Divided Loyalties Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010, pages 265-266.
In September 1994, the Liberal Premier of Quebec Daniel Johnson  was defeated by PQ led by Jacques Parizeau in the 1994 Quebec election.Jeffrey, Brooke Divided Loyalties Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010, pages 272-273 The victory of the PQ meant that another referendum was guaranteed, but Chrétien saw this as an opportunity to destroy the Quebec sovereignty movement once and for all.Jeffrey, Brooke Divided Loyalties Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010, page 273 Parizeau was a "hard separatist" committed to a totally independent Quebec, and was thus regarded as a far easier opponent to defeat than "soft separatists" like René Lévesque or Lucien Bouchard, who wanted Quebec to become sovereign, but still maintain some links with Canada in the form of sovereignty association. Chrétien told the Liberal caucus that "We got them cornered", and predicated with Parizeau leading the PQ, the separatists would suffer such a defeat at the next referendum that it would being the end of separatism.
Chrétien was known to be a Sinophile and an admirer of the People's Republic of China. In November 1994, he led the first of four "Team Canada" trade missions comprising himself and 9 premiers to China (Premier Jacques Parizeau of Quebec declined to go), which had as their stated objective increasing Sino-Canadian trade. The Team Canada mission was meant to be the beginning of the export offensive that would stimulate the economy of the recession, and to achieve Chrétien's goal going back to the 1970s of a Canadian economy less dependent on trade with the United States.Jeffrey, Brooke Divided Loyalties Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010 pages 246 & 251.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 page 93 Under his leadership, China and Canada signed several bilateral relations agreements. The Team Canada missions attracted criticism that Chrétien seemed only concerned with economic issues, and that he rarely raised the subject of China's poor human rights record, and that on the few times that he did mention human rights in China that he went out of his way to avoid offending his hosts.Evertt, Robert "The Federal Government, Politics and National Institutions" pages 9-48 from Canadian Annual Review of Politics And Public Affairs, 2001 edited by David Mutimer, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2007 page 37. Moreover, Chrétien attracted criticism for presenting the case for improved human rights in purely economic terms, arguing that a better human rights record would allow China to join the WTO and thus sell more goods to the West, and never argued the case that human rights were a positive goal in and of themselves. Chrétien argued that there was no point in criticizing China's human rights record because the Chinese never listened to such criticism, and instead were greatly annoyed about being lectured by Western leaders about their poor human rights record.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 page 310 Given that Canada could not really do anything to change the views of China's leaders about human rights, Chrétien contended that the best that could be done was to improve Sino-Canadian economic relations while ignoring the subject of human rights.
In January 1995, the Wall Street Journal had published an editorial written by John Fund entitled "Bankrupt Canada?" strongly critical of the Chrétien government's deficit-fighting amid a crisis atmosphere caused by the collapse of the Mexican economy in late 1994, the Canadian dollar in steep decline, and soaring interest rates, which put strong pressure on the Chrétien government to do more to reduce the deficit.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 pages 97-98. The Wall Street Journal's editorial "Bankrupt Canada?" attracted much media attention in Canada and was taken as a sign that all was not well with the national finances. In particular by early 1995 the rising interest rates started to make achieving the target of reducing the deficit to 3% of GDP more and more impossible to achieve, and thus pressured the government to introduce a budget that would assure the markets that the deficit would be eliminated, not reduced in the near-future.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 pages 98-99 Through not directly impacting on the Canadian economy very much, the Mexican economic meltdown in December 1994 served as a graphic and terrifying example of what happened when a nation did not manage its finances properly, and perhaps made elements of the Canadian public more open to the goal of eliminating the deficit despite the short-term pain than what they would had otherwise been. Further applying pressure on Canada was a warning from Moody's that Canada's debt rating would downgraded again if the 1995 budget did not contain a credible deficit elimination plan.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 page 101 Martin went on a tour of various world financial centers in early 1995 to drum up interest in buying Canadian bonds, and found that investors had no such interest, telling him that Canada had promising since the 1970s to deal with the deficit, and they wanted action, not words this time.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 page 98
Chrétien was not keen on making deep cuts to government spending, but given the crisis caused by the skyrocketing interest rates had decided "reluctantly" there was no alternative. Once he had decided upon making deeper cuts than he promised, Chrétien proved to be firm supporter of the new course, and supported Martin's cuts to other departments despite the complaints of the other ministers.Jeffrey, Brooke Divided Loyalties Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010, page 267. Chrétien's advisor Eddie Goldenberg later recalled that Chrétien was unyielding in the face of efforts by other ministers to "spare" their departments, and that Chrétien kept on saying "If I change anything, everything will unravel". In a 2011 interview, Chrétien recalled about the 1995 budget that: "There would have been a day when we would have been the Greece of today. I knew we were in a bind and we had to do something."[ref]
