</ref> In the 1970s, most maquiladoras were located around the [[Mexico – United States border]]. By 1994, these were spread in the interior parts of the country, although the majority of the plants were still near the border. Recent research indicates that the maquiladora industry has an impact on U.S. border city employment in service sectors.<ref>[http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/papers/2011/wp1107.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, ''The Impact of the Maquiladora Industry on U.S. Border Cities'', 2011]</ref>
Although the maquiladora industry suffered due to the early 2000s recession, maquiladoras constituted 54% of the US-Mexico trade in 2004, and by 2005, the maquiladora exports accounted for half of Mexico's exports. The industry had become an important source of FDI and foreign exchange for Mexico.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
In the 2000s, the maquila industry faced competition due to rise of other countries with availability of cheap labor, including Malaysia, India, and Pakistan. The biggest threat came from China's Special Economic Areas.

==Growth and development==

During the later half of the sixties, maquiladora industries rapidly expanded geographically and economically and by 1985, had become Mexico’s second largest source of income from exports, behind oil.Stoddard, Ellwyn R. Maquila: Assembly Plants in Northern Alaska. p. 2. Since 1973, maquiladoras have also accounted for nearly half of Mexico’s export assembly. Between 1995 and 2000, exports of assembled products in Mexico tripled, and the rate of the industry’s growth amounted to about one new factory per day.Shorris, Earl. The Life and Times of Mexico. p. 531 By the late twentieth century, the industry accounted for 25 percent of Mexico’s gross domestic product, and 17 percent of total Mexican employment.Hausman, Angela and Diana L Haytko. Cross-border Supply Chain Relationships: Interpretive Research of Maquiladora Realized Strategies. p. 25.
Since globalization and physical restructuring[tpl]Citation needed|reason=please cite the recent addition of "physical restructuring".|date=January 2009[/tpl] have contributed to the competition and advent of low-cost offshore assembly in places such as China, and countries in Central America, maquiladoras in Mexico have been on the decline since 2000: According to federal sources, approximately 529 maquiladoras shut down and investment in assembly plants decreased by 8.2 percent in 2002. Despite the decline, there still exist over 3,000 maquiladoras along the 2,000 mile-long United States–Mexico border, providing employment for approximately one million workers, and importing more than $51 billion in supplies into Mexico.Villalobos, J Rene, et al. Inbound for Mexico. p. 38. Research indicates that maquiladoras' post-NAFTA growth is connected to changes in Mexican wages relative to those in Asia and in the United States, and to fluctuations in U.S. industrial production.Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Did NAFTA Really Cause Mexico's High Maquiladora Growth?, July 2001 As of 2006, maquiladoras still account for 45 percent of Mexico’s exports.Gruben, William C. and Sherry L. Kiser. The Border Economy: NAFTA and Maquiladoras: Is the Growth Connected?  Maquiladoras, in general, are best represented among operations that are particularly assembly intensive.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]

==Working conditions==

One of the main goals of the Border Industrialization Program was to attract foreign investment.  To do that, Mexican labor is kept cheap and competitive with other major export countries to keep the United States firms operating within the Mexican assembly plants. Mexican women work for approximately one-sixth of the U.S. hourly rate.The Human Race: Escaping From History. Employee turnover is also relatively high, ''. p. 52.
Young women are often preferred over older women, as younger women are capable of working longer hours. Women are often subjected to unsafe and unsanitary working conditions.[tpl]cite book|last=Aguilar, Delia D.|first=Lacsamana, Anne E.|title=Women and Globalization|year=2004|publisher=Humanity Books|location=New York|isbn=1591021626|page=130[/tpl] Poverty is a key factor that motivates women, in particular, to work in maquiladoras. The minimum wage set by the Mexican government is barely enough to help sustain a family. The minimum wage "buys only about a quarter of the basic necessities that are essential for a typical worker’s family".[tpl]cite journal|last=Kopinak|first=Kathryn|title=Gender as a Vehicle for the Subordination of Women Maquiladora Workers in Mexico|journal=Latin American Perspectives|year=1995|volume=22|page=36[/tpl]

==Gender composition of workforce==

Mexico possesses a strong system of labor laws, yet enforcement of these laws within the maquiladora industry is often lax.Kamel, Rachel and Anya Hoffman. The Maquiladora Reader: Cross-Border Organizing Since NAFTA. p. 1.  While most people who were employed under the original Bracero Program were men, the majority of maquiladora employees are young women.Kamel, Rachel and Anya Hoffman. The Maquiladora Reader: Cross-Border Organizing Since NAFTA. p. 3.  Women are preferred to men, because women typically work more .  Some maquiladora operators have admitted a preference for women also because women often display a greater level of patience and higher dexterity than men in performing the repetitive work of an assembly plant. 
In recent years, however, there has been a shift toward hiring more male workers due to labor shortages and the emergence of heavier industries operating within maquiladoras.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]

==Environmental effects==

Both the United States and Mexican governments claim to be committed to environmental protection, yet environmental policies have not always been enforced.Kamel, Rachel and Anya Hoffman. The Maquiladora reader: Cross-Border Organizing Since NAFTA. p. 42.  Although the La Paz Agreement signed by Mexico and the United States in 1983 requires hazardous waste created by United States corporations to be transported back to the U.S. for disposal, most companies avoid paying disposal costs by dumping toxins and other waste into Mexico’s rivers or deserts.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency reports that only 91 of the 600 maquiladoras located along the Texas-Mexico border have returned hazardous waste to the United States since 1987.Kelly, Mary E. Free Trade: The Politics of Toxic Waste. p. 48 This is likely due to the fact that most Maquiladoras are factories which perform sewing and assembly of consumer products.
In Mexico, some maquiladoras lack proper waste management facilities and the ability to clean up disposal sites, which is why some of the hazardous waste is illegally disposed of.   Environmental hazards associated with some maquiladoras include polluted rivers and contaminated drinking water.  According to the Southwest Consortium for Environmental Research and Policy (SCERP), all streams and rivers in the border region have been ecologically devastated as a consequence of the maquila industry.CorpWatch. Maquiladoras at a Glance. However, most of this damage is likely caused by the lack of sewage treatment infrastructure. Furthermore, the United States Geological Survey, the state of California, and the Imperial County Health Department have all asserted the New River, which flows from Mexicali near the border to the Salton Sea in California to be "...the dirtiest river in America."Sklair, Leslie. Assembling For Development: The Maquila Industry in Mexico and the United States. p. 94.
