Up to four worthy runners-up may be designated Honor Books and three or four have been named every year.

He was also an active member of YALSA, serving on the Best Books for Young Adults Committee and the Margaret A. Edwards Award Committee. He dedicated his life to ensuring that his students had access to good literature. To that end he encouraged writers to focus on the young adult audience. He created an author-in-residence program at the high school to promote new talent and encourage his students. His most noteworthy find was Chris Crutcher. Printz died at the age of 59 in 1996.American Libraries, March 1997, p. 76.

To 2014, no writer has won two of the fifteen Printz Awards. David Almond, John Green, and Marcus Sedgwick have written one Award winner and one Honor Book. Four people have two Honor Books: M. T. Anderson, Margo Lanagan, Terry Pratchett and Markus Zusak.
Four writers have won both the Printz Award and the annual Carnegie Medal from the British librarians: David Almond, Aidan Chambers, Geraldine McCaughrean, and Meg Rosoff. Chambers alone has won both for the same book, the 1999 Carnegie and 2003 Printz for the novel Postcards from No Man's Land."The Carnegie Medal: Full List of Winners".
