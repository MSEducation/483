The American Constitution Society for Law and Policy (ACS) is a progressive legal organization that promotes the U.S. Constitutional values of "individual rights and liberties, genuine equality, access to justice, democracy and the rule of law." "Mission", American Constitution Society for Law and Policy
According to the ACS website:
ACS is centered around the idea that the law should be a force to improve the lives of all people. It works for positive change by shaping debate on vitally important legal and constitutional issues through development and promotion of high-impact ideas to opinion leaders and the media; by building networks of lawyers, law students, judges and policymakers dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values. By bringing together powerful, relevant ideas and passionate, talented people, ACS makes a difference in the constitutional, legal and public policy debates that shape our democracy.http://www.acslaw.org/about/mission
ACS was created as a counterweight to, and is modeled after, the Federalist Society, and is often described as its progressive counterpart.Michael McGough, Supreme Court nomination battle spotlights legal societies and their divergent views: Newer American Constitution Society modeled on more conservative Federalist Society (August 14, 2005), Pittsburg Post-Gazette.Jonathan H.
