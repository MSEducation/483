Greg Evans (b. November 13, 1947) is an American cartoonist and the creator of the syndicated comic strip Luann. He received the 2003 National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award for the strip. He has been nominated four other times for the same award.
In 100 Years of American Newspaper Comics, Dennis Wepman wrote that Evans "taught junior and senior high school art in his native California, worked as promotion manager and graphic artist for a TV station in Colorado, and entertained with a robot at trade shows and fairs before he sold Luann to News America Syndicate in 1984." 
Evans has written a musical based on Luann, Luann: Scenes in a Teen's Life, which debuted March 2008 at Palomar College in San Marcos, California. It was directed by Dana Case.
Prior to Luann, Evans published the comic strip Fogarty, distributed free to high school newspapers. It featured the character Mr. Fogarty, who continues in the same role as a character in Luann.
Evans lives in San Marcos, California, near San Diego.
