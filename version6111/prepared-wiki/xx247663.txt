[[1997 TFL Statewide League season]]

CATEGORIES: Tasmanian Football League, Sport in Tasmania

The 1997 TFL Statewide League premiership season was an Australian rules football competition, staged across Tasmania, Australia over twenty (20) roster rounds and six (6) finals series matches between 12 April and 20 September 1997.

This was the twelfth season of statewide football and the League was known as the Cascade-Boags Draught Super League under a dual commercial naming-rights sponsorship agreement with both Cascade Brewery in Hobart and Boag's Brewery in Launceston.
 
At the conclusion of this season four clubs left the competition owing to severe financial problems.
 
Hobart, in debt to the tune of $450,000, were already advised by TFL executives that they would not be granted a renewed license to continue on in the TFL after this season and decided to join the SFL from 1998, both South Launceston and Launceston continued to find onfield success minimal and were also servicing large debts that looked likely to continue to grow and promptly pulled out of the competition and rejoined the NTFL from 1998 whilst Sandy Bay, unable to find a merger partner, was wound up at season's end and became defunct.
