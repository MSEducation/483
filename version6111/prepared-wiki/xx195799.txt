The 2002 Oregon gubernatorial election took place on November 5, 2002. Incumbent Democratic Governor of Oregon John Kitzhaber was unable to seek a third consecutive term as Governor, therefore creating an open seat. To replace him, former Oregon Supreme Court Associate Justice Ted Kulongoski won a crowded and competitive Democratic primary, while former State Representative Kevin Mannix emerged from an equally competitive Republican primary. The campaign between Kulongoski and Mannix, who were joined by Libertarian nominee Tom Cox, was close and went down to the wire. Ultimately, Kulongoski eked out a narrow margin of victory over Mannix, which was slightly smaller than Cox's total vote share, allowing Kulongoski to win what would be the first of two terms as Governor.

Kulongoski focused on education, his support for gay rights and the Oregon Death with Dignity law. Mannix campaigned on his plans to cut taxes to stimulate the economy of Oregon and encouraging partnerships between businesses and colleges. Tom Cox for the Libertarian party and two write in candidates, Richard Alevizos and Gary Spanovich, also stood in the election.[tpl]cite web| url = http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2002/09/23/News/Governor.Race.Heats.Up-1978032.shtml | title = Governor race heats up | accessdate = 2008-05-20 | date = 2002-09-23| publisher = Oregon Daily Emerald[/tpl]
The departure of Kitzhaber, who had opposed plans to build a Columbia Gorge casino, was considered an opportunity for the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. Tribes invested record amounts of money into Oregon politics in this race, including $40,000 supporting Kulongoski. Kulongoski did not take a position on the issue during the campaign, but later became a supporter of the plan.
Kulongoski campaigned using a motor home and his many visits to bowling alleys became a trademark of his campaign.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2002-11-11--kulongoski-usat_x.htm | title = Blue-collar campaign allows lawyer to bowl over challenger | accessdate = 2008-05-20 | date = 2002-11-11| publisher = USA Today | first1=Richard | last1=Benedetto[/tpl] Early in the campaign Kulongoski held a large lead over Mannix in the polls but the gap narrowed as the election neared after Mannix put Kulongoski on the defensive. Mannix characterised Kulongoski as a strong tax and spender after he endorsed a proposed 313 million dollar income tax rise to avoid cuts in education and other areas.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,66521,00.html | title = Seeming Shoo-In Finds Himself Fighting | accessdate = 2008-05-20 | date = 2002-10-23| publisher = Fox News Channel[/tpl] He also attacked Kulongoski for being soft on crime. A poll in October showed Kulongoski on 45%, only 4 percent ahead of Mannix on 41%.
Mannix conceded the election on 6 November 2002 after Kulongoski secured a decisive lead in the vote count. The Libertarian candidate Tom Cox claimed that he was responsible for Kulongoski's victory as his exit polls suggested he took twice as many Republican votes as Democratic votes.[tpl]cite web| url = http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2002/11/07/UndefinedSection/Mannix.Concedes.In.Race.For.Governor-1978729.shtml | title = Mannix concedes in race for governor | accessdate = 2008-05-21 | date = 2002-11-07| publisher = Oregon Daily Emerald[/tpl]
