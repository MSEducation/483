[[Take the Long Road and Walk It]]

CATEGORIES: The Music (band) songs, 2001 singles, 2002 singles

"Take the Long Road and Walk It" is the name of The Music's first single, released in a limited press of 1,000 copies on Fierce Panda records. The song was later re-recorded for the band's debut album the following year. Both versions of the song have separate videos. When the album was released, Hut Records re-released the original version of the single as the second CD in a 2-disc set.
The track "The Walls Get Smaller" would later be re-recorded as the hidden track for the band's second album Welcome to the North. "New Instrumental" is hidden in a pre-gap on the band's first album, and can be found by rewinding from the beginning of "The Dance".
