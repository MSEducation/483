==Previous operations==

The Students' Union previously owned and operated a number of student venues in Derby. The Union's city centre venues were in desperate need of refurbishment. There was a Â£400,000 maintenance backlog on the buildings, all the old bar equipment and pumps needed replacing, for instance. If the union had continued to occupy the building they would have had to have done that maintenance work. Taking this into account the decision was made to close The Late Bar pub, Union One and Union Two clubs.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.derby-guide.co.uk/derby_entertainment.html | title = Derby Entertainment: Media | accessdate = 2011-05-25 | publisher = Derby Accommodation and Tourist Guide[/tpl] As well as these venues there was previously a bar located at the University's Lonsdale Hall halls of residence. With the closure of these locations, the Academy Bar is the only Students' Union owned entertainments venue.
Prior to the opening of the Academy Bar, the Students' Union operated a bar called The Union Arms [tpl]cite web | url = http://www.derby.ac.uk/udsu/uarms.html | title = Media | accessdate = 2011-05-25 | publisher = University of Derby Students Union |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000623162540/http://www.derby.ac.uk/udsu/uarms.html |archivedate=2000-06-23[/tpl] at the Kedleston Road Campus, whist the Richardson Hall (location of the new Academy bar) was used for concerts and events.
