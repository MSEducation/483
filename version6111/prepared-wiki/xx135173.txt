==Critical reception==

Financial Times critic in May 2006:
"I have seen actors from Alan Bates to Matthew Macfadyen play Shakespeare’s Benedick, but Joseph Millson’s performance in the new RSC production strikes me as definitive. Handsome in voice and in person, he can carry the audience on his roar and draw it into his hush. The elements of wit, anger and vulnerability are thrillingly mixed in this actor".[tpl]cite news|last=MacAulay|first=Alastair|title=Much Ado about Nothing, Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c5dfde64-e9b0-11da-a33b-0000779e2340.html|publisher=The Financial Times|date=22 May 2006|accessdate=20 May 2010[/tpl]
