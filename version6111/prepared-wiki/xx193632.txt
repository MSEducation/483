The Burton Borough School is situated on the southern edge of Newport, Shropshire, England, in Audley Avenue.  The school was opened in 1957 and since then has developed steadily. In September 2004 it was designated a Specialist Arts College.
The school is named after a local man J.S. Burton Borough, who was deputy lieutenant for Shropshire and High Sheriff and became the first governor of the school.

==Development==

Over the last ten years the school has grown due to the growth of Newport, the school went from 800 to 1300 pupils and has had to expand and modernise the building.
The first large piece of building work was in 1999 when it was decided to expand the music department, by building a new complex fitted with art gallery, large music rooms, small rooms for 'one to one' development, a theatre and external theatre, plus a recording studio.
With the new students, the school received additional funding from the government, which the school decided to spend developing the English department, by building a new block made up of five new classrooms, this development went alongside the new gym and sports hall which was built next to the Army Cadet Force hut.
The school is also known for its successful Ofsted reports.
The School has built a reputation for its music and its Concert Band and Big Band have won numerous awards and competed in national and international competitions. They consistently win the top awards at the National concert Band Festivals.

==Further plans==

The local council and Telford and Wrekin are planning to build a new swimming pool and sports complex on the schools playing field and they are joining with New College, Telford and have some Sixth Form Classes on the Burton Borough site.  [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl]
