Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, also known as Abu Hashim, was one of the Salaf and a Narrator of hadith.
His father was Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, a son of Ali. Abu Hashim had a brother called Hasan. 
Among the Isnad he is included in is the Hadith of prohibition of Mut'ah at Khaybar.
After his father's death in 700 CE, many Shiites looked to Abu Hashim as the heir of his grandfather Ali. These Shia were the Hashimiyya sub-sect of the Kaysanites Shia. After his own death, the early Abbasids claimed that Abu Hashim had designated Muhammad, father to the later first two Abbasid caliphs As-Saffah and Al-Mansur, as his heir and head of the clan of the Banu Hashim.

Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani graded the two sons of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah to be weak in Hadith, arguing that one was a murji'i, and the other to be a Shi'ite.Tahdhib al-Tahdhib
On the other hand, Ibn Sa'd stated that "Abu Hashim has knowledge and transmission. He was  reliable in Hadith, and has narrated a few accepted hadiths."The Book of the Major Classes
