[[Pseudometric space]]

CATEGORIES: Properties of topological spaces, Metric geometry

In mathematics, a pseudometric space is a generalized metric space in which the distance between two distinct points can be zero. In the same way as every normed space is a metric space, every seminormed space is a pseudometric space. Because of this analogy the term semimetric space (which has a different meaning in topology) is sometimes used as a synonym, especially in functional analysis.
When a topology is generated using a family of pseudometrics, the space is called a gauge space.

==Definition==

==Examples==

==Topology==

The pseudometric topology is the topology induced by the open balls
which form a basis for the topology.[tpl]planetmath reference|id=6284|title=Pseudometric topology[/tpl] A topological space is said to be a pseudometrizable topological space if the space can be given a pseudometric such that the pseudometric topology coincides with the given topology on the space.
The difference between pseudometrics and metrics is entirely topological. That is, a pseudometric is a metric if and only if the topology it generates is T0 (i.e. distinct points are topologically distinguishable).

==Metric identification==

An example of this construction is the completion of a metric space by its Cauchy sequences.
