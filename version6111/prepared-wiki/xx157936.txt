Subsequently, Smith finished his collegiate career at Weber State. During his brief tenure at Weber, Smith played well enough to receive an invitation to the 2007 NFL Combine.
A hamstring injury at the combine would sideline Smith who was unable to generate interest from any NFL teams following the injury.
