The mission of the Centre is to exhibit the Okanagan Desert and the culture of the Okanagan people, and to promote conservation efforts for desert wildlife.Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre - Our Sustainable Building.

==Exhibits==

The Centre includes both indoor and outdoor exhibits and trails.  It is designed as an interactive learning environment with hands-on displays and two multi-media theatres. Exhibits include recreated examples of Aboriginal architecture structures:  a Tipi, Pit-house, and Sweat lodge.  The building is adjacent to a remnant of the desert, approximately 1,600 acres of which are being preserved as a conservation area.Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre, Archdaily.

The Centre's Rattlesnake Research Program receives support from Environment Canada to study Western Rattlesnakes and Great Basin Gopher snakes. The snakes are tracked and studied by biologists using radio telemetry.Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre - Protection Desert Dwellers.  Retrieved 2014-01-23 

==Facilities==

The Centre was designed by Hotson Bakker Boniface Haden architects + urbanists, and completed in 2006. The construction cost was $6.6 million for the 39,000 square metre (interior and exterior spaces) facility. The design is both an homage to the traditional winter dwellings of the Okanagan peoples and a literal integration into the natural landscape with a contemporary architectural design.  The building is constructed partially underground with the desert landscape extending over the buildingâ€™s planted (green) roof and the front of the building is constructed of a rammed earth facade.  This rammed earth wall is constructed of local soils, concrete, and colour additives.  At 80m long, 5.5m high, and 0.6m thick, it is (as of 2014) the largest in North America.  Its thickness and mass provide an insulating value of R-33 that help to provide a more stable indoor temperature than the large temperature swings of the surrounding desert climate.Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre, Archdaily.

Blue stain pine boards are used throughout the interior of the project. This wood, Lodgepole pine damaged by the Mountain pine beetle and blue stain fungus was harvested from local forests devastated by these invasive species.  The use of this material serves as a demonstration project of how this product, which is typically considered unsuitable for a finish material, can be utilized.Canadian Architect, 2008-05-01.
