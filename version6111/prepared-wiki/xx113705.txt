[[Mind on the Moon]]

CATEGORIES: 2000 albums, Snow albums, EMI Records albums

Mind on the Moon is an album by Canadian reggae musician Snow, released in 2000.  Despite being his fifth album, this was the first disc since his 1993 debut 12 Inches of Snow that Snow returned to the pop charts and received mainstream airplay on both radio and television.
The initial single "Everybody Wants To Be Like You" received the most radio play, but it was the second single, "The Plumb Song", that was on the heavier rotation on MuchMusic.  This was likely due to the music video which featured Snow play every role, with the different characters having interactions with each other. "Joke Thing" and "Nothin' On Me" were less successful singles off the album.
