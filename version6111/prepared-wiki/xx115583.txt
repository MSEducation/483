[[Endothelin receptor]]

CATEGORIES: G protein coupled receptors

There are at least four known endothelin receptors, ETA, ETB1, ETB2 and ETC,[tpl]cite book|first=by Walter F. Boron, Emile L.

==Physiological functions==

===Brain and nerves===

Widely distributed in the body, receptors for endothelin are present in blood vessels and cells of the brain, choroid plexus and peripheral nerves. When applied directly to the brain of rats in picomolar quantities as an experimental model of stroke, endothelin-1 caused severe metabolic stimulation and seizures with substantial decreases in blood flow to the same brain regions, both effects mediated by calcium channels.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gross PM, Zochodne DW, Wainman DS, Ho LT, Espinosa FJ, Weaver DF | title = Intraventricular endothelin-1 uncouples the blood flow: metabolism relationship in periventricular structures of the rat brain: involvement of L-type calcium channels | journal = Neuropeptides | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 155–65 |date=July 1992 | pmid = 1331845 | doi = 10.1016/0143-4179(92)90158-S| url = | issn = [/tpl]
A similar strong vasoconstrictor action of endothelin-1 was demonstrated in a peripheral neuropathy model in rats.[tpl]cite journal | author = Zochodne DW, Ho LT, Gross PM | title = Acute endoneurial ischemia induced by epineurial endothelin in the rat sciatic nerve | journal = Am.

==Clinical significance==

Mutations in the EDNRB gene are associated with ABCD syndrome[tpl]cite journal | author = Verheij JB, Kunze J, Osinga J, van Essen AJ, Hofstra RM | title = ABCD syndrome is caused by a homozygous mutation in the EDNRB gene | journal = Am.

Med. Genet. | volume = 34 | issue = 8 | pages = 656–65 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9279758 | doi = 10.1136/jmg.34.8.656| pmc = 1051028 [/tpl]
