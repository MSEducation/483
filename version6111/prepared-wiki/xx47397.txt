141 Lumen is a dark (C-type), large rocky asteroid 130 km in diameter orbiting in the main belt near the Eunomia family of asteroids. [tpl]citation needed span|text=It is not, however, physically related to the group, being of the wrong spectral class.|date=March 2008[/tpl] Yet, NASA continues to categorize it as a main-belt asteroid.JPL Small-Body Database Browser
It was discovered on January 13, 1875, by the brothers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry, but Paul is the one who was given the credit for this discovery. It is named for Lumen: Récits de l'infini, a book by the astronomer Camille Flammarion.Schmadel Lutz D.  Dictionary of Minor Planet Names (fifth edition), Springer, 2003. ISBN 3-540-00238-3.
Richard P. Binzel and Schelte J. Bus further added to the knowledge about this asteroid in a light-curve survey published in 2003. This project was known as Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey, Phase II or SMASSII, which built on a previous survey of the main-belt asteroids. The visible-wavelength (0.435–0.925 micrometre) spectra data was gathered between August 1993 and March 1999.Bus, S., Binzel, R. P. Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey, Phase II.

Lightcurve data has also been recorded by observers at the Antelope Hill Observatory, which has been designated as an official observatory by the Minor Planet Center.Lightcurve Results
