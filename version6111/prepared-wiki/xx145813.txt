Kustow grew up in North London and started his professional guitar playing career as a member of Tom Robinson Band (TRB) in January 1977. After an initial hit with the single "2-4-6-8 Motorway" the band recorded their debut album Power in the Darkness (produced by Chris Thomas), which was released in 1978.
Just after the release of their second album TRB Two (1979) (produced by Todd Rundgren), the band broke up in October 1979.
After the breakup, Kustow found himself in a series of short lived projects, such as Time UK with former drummer from The Jam, Rick Buckler; The Spectres with former Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock; and The Planets. He also played with Tom Robinson as a guest, on tracks like "War Baby".
