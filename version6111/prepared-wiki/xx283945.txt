CATEGORIES: 2011 films

Sahkanaga is a 2011 feature film written and directed by American filmmaker John Henry Summerour. The film uses the true events of the Tri-State Crematory incident as its setting and backdrop, though the central characters are fictional.

==Background and development==

Summerour began working on the film script after learning that over 300 bodies had been dumped in the woods near the Tri-State Crematory instead of being incinerated by the operators. A 15-minute short film was adapted from the full script and shot in 2007. The short production cast local, non-professional actors as a "litmus test" to determine if local talent (many of whom were directly affected by the incident) could be used without resulting in awkward and exaggerated performances."Director John Henry Summeror on Sahkanaga", Filmmaker magazine, accessed January 8, 2014.
