[[Gluten-free diet]]

CATEGORIES: Diets, 2010s fads and trends

A gluten-free diet (GF diet) is a diet that excludes foods containing gluten. Gluten is a protein composite found in  wheat (including kamut and spelt), barley, rye and triticale. A gluten-free diet is the only medically accepted treatment for celiac disease.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Hischenhuber | first1 = C. | last2 = Crevel | first2 = R. | last3 = Jarry | first3 = B. | last4 = Maki | first4 = M. | last5 = Moneret-Vautrin | first5 = D.

People with these diseases are considered gluten intolerant. There is a minority of people who suffer from wheat intolerance alone and are tolerant to gluten. Gluten sensitivity is another reason people will choose to go gluten-free. 
Despite the health claims for gluten-free eating, there is no published experimental evidence to support such claims for the general population.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Gaesser | first1 = G.

This expansion is extremely valuable for those with celiac disease or other medical reasons, such as gluten intolerance or sensitivity. However, a gluten-free diet does not hold the same benefits for the general public. Unless care is taken, a gluten-free diet may lack vitamins, minerals, and fiber. 
A gluten-free diet might also exclude oats. Medical practitioners are divided on whether oats are acceptable to celiac disease sufferers[tpl]cite web|url=http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/82/972/672|title=Celiac disease and oats: a systematic review|publisher=The Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine|author=N Y Haboubi, S Taylor, S Jones|year=2006[/tpl] or whether they become cross-contaminated in milling facilities by other grains."The Gluten-Free Diet", CeliacSociety.com Oats may be contaminated when grown in rotation with wheat when wheat seeds from the previous harvest sprout up the next season in the oat field and are harvested with the oats.
The exact level at which gluten is harmless for people with celiac disease is uncertain. A 2008 systematic review tentatively concluded that consumption of less than 10 mg of gluten per day for celiac disease patients is unlikely to cause histological abnormalities, although it noted that few reliable studies had been conducted.

==Gluten-free food==

Gluten-free food is normally seen as a diet for celiac disease, but people with a gluten allergy (an unrelated disease) should avoid wheat and related grains.
Meat, fruits, vegetables, potato, and rice are gluten-free foods.   
Several grains and starch sources are considered acceptable for a gluten-free diet. The most frequently used are corn, potatoes, rice, and tapioca (derived from cassava). Other grains and starch sources generally considered suitable for gluten-free diets include amaranth, arrowroot, millet, montina, lupin, quinoa, sorghum (jowar), taro, teff, chia seed, almond meal flour, coconut flour, pea flour, cornstarch and yam. Sometimes various types of bean, soybean, and nut flours are used in gluten-free products to add protein and dietary fiber.
Almond flour has a low glycemic index. Despite its name, buckwheat is not related to wheat. Pure buckwheat is considered acceptable for a gluten-free diet, however, many commercial buckwheat products are mixtures[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl] of wheat and buckwheat flours, and thus, not gluten-free. Gram flour, derived from chickpeas, is gluten-free (this is not the same as Graham flour made from wheat).
Gluten may be used in foods in some unexpected ways, for example it may be added as a stabilizing agent or thickener in products such as ice-cream and ketchup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/columnnn/nn030331.html|title=Gluten sensitivity more widespread than previously thought|publisher=Colorado State University Extension|author=Pat Kendall, Ph.D., R.D.|date=March 31, 2003[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://bidmc.harvard.edu/default.asp?leaf_id=12799|title=Following a Gluten-free Diet|publisher=Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center|author= |date= A Harvard teaching hospital[/tpl]
A gluten-free diet rules out all ordinary breads, pastas, and many convenience foods; it also excludes gravies, custards, soups, and sauces thickened with wheat, rye, barley, or other gluten-containing flour. Gluten-free bakery and pasta products are available from specialty retailers.

===Cross-contamination issues===

A gluten-free diet allows for fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, and many dairy products. The diet allows rice, corn, soy, potato, tapioca, beans, sorghum, quinoa, millet, pure buckwheat, arrowroot, amaranth, teff, Montina, and nut flours and the diet prohibits the ingestion of wheat, barley, rye, and related components, including triticale, durum, graham, kamut, semolina, spelt, malt, malt flavouring, or malt vinegar.American Dietetic Association: Hot topics: gluten-free diets www.eatright.org/search.aspx? Dec. 2009
The finding of a 2010 study indicates that some inherently gluten-free grains, seed, and flours not labeled gluten-free are contaminated with gluten. The consumption of these products can lead to inadvertent gluten intake.Journal of the American Dietetic Association. June 2010;939 The use of highly sensitive assays is mandatory to certify gluten-free food products. The European Union, World Health Organization, and Codex Alimentarius require reliable measurement of the wheat prolamins, gliadins rather than all-wheat proteins.Codex Alimentarius (2003) Draft revised standards for gluten-free foods, report of the 25th session of the Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses, November 2003
There is no general agreement on the analytical method used to measure gluten in ingredients and food products.Hischenhuber C, Crevel R, Jarry B, Makai M, Moneret-Vautrin DA, Romano A, Troncone R, Ward R (2006) Review article: safe amounts of gluten for patients with wheat allergy or coeliac disease. Aliment Pharmacol Ther 23(5):5590575 The ELISA method was designed to detect w-gliadins, but it suffered from the setback that it lacked sensitivity for barley prolamins.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Poms | first1 = R.

In the processing of gluten-containing grains, gluten is removed as shown in the processing flow below:
Since ordinary wheat flour contains approximately 12% gluten,[tpl]cite book | last = Spersud | first = Erik and Jennifer | title = Everything You Want To Know About Recipes And Restaurants And Much More | publisher = Authorhouse | date = January 3, 2008 | location = USA | page = 172 | url = http://glutenfreeenterprises.com/index.html | doi = 10.1007/b62130 | isbn = 978-1-4343-6034-2[/tpl] even a tiny amount of wheat flour can cross-contaminate a gluten-free product, therefore, considerable care must be taken to prevent cross-contamination in commercial and home food preparation.
Many so-called gluten-free products, such as chicken bouillon, corn cereal, and caramel ice cream topping, have been found to have been contaminated with gluten. For example, in an investigation reported by the Chicago Tribune on November 21, 2008, Wellshire Farms chicken nuggets labeled "gluten-free" were purchased from a Whole Foods Market and samples were sent to a food allergy laboratory at the University of Nebraska.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-081120-allergens-tribune-investigation,0,4610982.story|title=Children at risk in food roulette|work=Chicagotribune.com|accessdate=September 20, 2009 | first=Sam | last=Roe[/tpl] Results of the testing indicated gluten was present in levels exceeding 2,000 ppm. After the article was published, the products continued to be sold. After receiving customer inquiries, however, more than a month later, the Whole Foods Market removed the product from their shelves. Wellshire Farms has since replaced the batter used in their chicken nuggets.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-whole_foodsdec31,0,4055580.story|title=Whole Foods pulls 'gluten-free' products from shelves after Tribune story|work=Chicagotribune.com|accessdate=September 20, 2009|first=Sam|last=Roe[/tpl]
Pure chocolate is gluten free but additives with gluten or contamination from the use of machines which previously processed gluten containing food is possible. Several vendors produce chocolate labeled "gluten free".Is chocolate gluten-free, Gluten free dark chocolate
Some non-foodstuffs such as medications and vitamin supplements, especially those in tablet form, may contain gluten as an excipient or binding agent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ipecamericas.org/public/faqs.html#question4|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=IPC Americas Inc|date=February 27, 2008|accessdate=April 15, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080411172805/http://www.ipecamericas.org/public/faqs.html#question4  |archivedate = April 11, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glutenfreedrugs.com/Excipients.htm|title=Excipient Ingredients in Medications|date=November 3, 2007|accessdate=April 15, 2008|publisher=Gluten Free Drugs[/tpl] People with gluten intolerances may therefore require specialist compounding of their medication.

===Cross-contamination problems===

A growing body of evidence suggests that a majority of people with celiac disease and following a gluten-free diet can safely consume pure oats in moderate amounts.
Special care is necessary when checking product ingredient lists since gluten comes in many forms: vegetable proteins and starch, modified food starch (when derived from wheat instead of maize), malt flavoring, unless specifically labeled as corn malt. Many ingredients contain wheat or barley derivatives. Maltodextrin is gluten-free since it is highly modified, no matter what the source.[tpl]cite web|title=Gluten Free Living|url=http://glutenfreeliving.com/ingredient.php#maltodextrin Ingredients|accessdate=August 31, 2009[/tpl]

===Oats===

The suitability of oats in the gluten-free diet is somewhat controversial. Some research suggests that oats in themselves are gluten-free, but they are virtually always contaminated by other grains during distribution or processing. Recent research,[tpl]cite journal | author = Arentz-Hansen H, Fleckenstein B, Molberg Ø, Scott H, Koning F, Jung G, Roepstorff P, Lundin KE, Sollid LM | title = The Molecular Basis for Oat Intolerance in Patients with Coeliac Disease | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = e1 | date = October 19, 2004 | pmid = 15526039 | pmc = 523824 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0010001 | url = http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0010001 | publisher = PLoS Medicine | accessdate = July 22, 2006 [/tpl] however, indicated that a protein naturally found in oats (avenin) possessed peptide sequences closely resembling wheat gluten and caused mucosal inflammation in significant numbers of celiac disease sufferers. Some examination results show that even oats that are not contaminated with wheat particles are nonetheless dangerous, while not very harmful to the majority. Such oats are generally considered risky for children with celiac disease to eat, but two studies show that they are completely safe for adults with celiac disease to eat.
People who merely are "gluten-sensitive" may be able to eat oats without adverse effect,[tpl]cite journal | author = Størsrud S, Olsson M, Arvidsson Lenner R, Nilsson LA, Nilsson O, Kilander A | title = Adult celiac patients do tolerate large amounts of oats | journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | date = May 7, 2002 | pmid = 12548312 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601525 | url = http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v57/n1/full/1601525a.html | accessdate = August 14, 2008 [/tpl] even over a period of five years.[tpl]cite journal | title = No harm from five year ingestion of oats in celiac disease | last = Janatuinen | first = E K | date = May 1, 2002 | url = http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/gca?allch=&SEARCHID=1&VOLUME=50&FIRSTPAGE=332&FIRSTINDEX=0&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=1&gca=gutjnl%3B50%2F3%2F332 | journal = GUT Journal Online | coauthors = T A Kemppainen; R J K Julkunen; V-M Kosma; M Mäki; M Heikkinen; M I J Uusitupa | accessdate = August 14, 2008 [/tpl]
Given this conflicting information, excluding oats appears to be the only risk-free practice for celiac disease sufferers of all ages,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csaceliacs.org/InfoonOats.php|title=The Scoop on Oats|publisher=Celiac Sprue Association (CSA)|date=February 20, 2008[/tpl] however, medically approved guidelines exist for those with celiac disease who do wish to introduce oats into their diet.
Unless manufactured in a dedicated facility and under gluten-free practices, all cereal grains, including oats, may be cross-contaminated with gluten. Grains become contaminated with gluten by sharing the same farm, truck, mill, or bagging facility as wheat and other gluten-containing grains.

===Alcoholic beverages===

Several celiac disease groups report that according to the American Dietetic Association's Manual of Clinical Dietetics,"ADA Publishes Revised GF Diet Guidelines""Which alcoholic beverages are safe?" Celiac.com many types of alcoholic beverages are considered gluten-free, provided no colourings or other additives have been added as these ingredients may contain gluten. Although most forms of whiskey are distilled from a mash that includes grains that contain gluten, distillation removes any proteins present in the mash, including gluten. Although up to 49% of the mash for Bourbon and up to 20% of the mash for corn whiskey may be made up of wheat, or rye, all-corn Bourbons and corn whiskeys do exist, and are generally labeled as such. Spirits made without any grain such as brandy, wine, mead, cider, sherry, port, rum, tequila, and vermouth generally do not contain gluten. While some vineyards use a flour paste to caulk the oak barrels in which wine is aged,StaVin Barrel Inserts Inc. http://www.stavin.com/barrelsystems/insert.htm Retrieved May 18, 2009 tests have shown that no detectable amounts of gluten are present in the wine from those barrels.Celiac.com, referencing a study from The Gluten-Free Dietician, retrieved September 29, 2013 A small number of vineyards have also used gluten as a clarifying agent, though it is not the standard process; some studies have shown small amounts of gluten to remain in the wine after clarification.Simonato, Tolin, and Pasini, March 4, 2011 "Immunochemical and Mass Spectrometry Detection of Residual Proteins in Gluten Fined Red Wine," Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry Therefore, some people with celiac or strong gluten sensitivity may wish to exercise caution. Liqueurs and pre-mixed drinks should be examined carefully for gluten-derived ingredients.
Almost all beers are brewed with malted barley or wheat and will contain gluten. Sorghum and buckwheat-based gluten-free beers are available, but remain a niche market. Some low-gluten beers are available, however, there is disagreement over the use of gluten products in brewed beverages: Some brewers argue that in certain beers the proteins from such grains as barley or wheat are converted into amino acids during the clarification step of the brewing process and are therefore gluten-free,[tpl]cite web| year = 2006| url = http://www.celiac.com/st_prod.html?p_prodid=413| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060513235929/http://www.celiac.com/st_prod.html?p_prodid=413| archivedate = 2006-05-13| title = Is Beer Gluten-Free and Safe for People with Coeliac Disease?| publisher = Celiac.com[/tpl] although there is evidence that this protein degradation is only partial.[tpl]cite web| work=Australian barley technical Symposium| year = 2001| url = http://www.regional.org.au/au/abts/1999/sheehan.htm| title = Improved Methods for Determination of Beer Haze Protein Derived from Malt| publisher = Marian Sheehan A, Evan Evans B, and John Skerritt[/tpl] The Swedish government agency Livsmedelsverket carried out a study of the gluten content in a wide range of beers in 2005 and found that the majority of the beers tested contained less than 200 ppm gluten, with several brands containing less than 20 ppm.[tpl]cite web| work=Livsmedelsverket| year = 2005| url = http://sverigesbryggerier.se/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/ol-ingredienser-gluteninnehall1.pdf|title=Gluteninnehåll i de öl som analyserats vid Livsmedelsverket|language=Swedish[/tpl] However, they also found that many beers have extremely high levels of gluten so. If unsure, coeliacs are advised to avoid beer.

===Gluten-free bread===

Bread, which is a staple in many diets, typically is made from grains such as wheat that contain gluten. Wheat gluten contributes to the elasticity of dough and is thus an important component of bread. Gluten-free bread is made with ground flours from a variety of materials such as almonds, rice (rice bread), sorghum (sorghum bread), corn (cornbread), or legumes such as beans (bean bread). Since these flours lack gluten it can be difficult for them to retain their shape as they rise and they may be less "fluffy". Additives such as xanthum gum, guar gum, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), corn starch, or eggs are used to compensate for the lack of gluten.Schober TJ, Bean SR. Gluten-free baking: what is happening inside the bread? USDA.

=="Gluten-free" labels==

In commerce, the term 'gluten-free' is generally used to indicate a supposed harmless level of gluten rather than a complete absence.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Akobeng AK, Thomas AG |title=Systematic review: tolerable amount of gluten for people with coeliac disease |journal=Aliment.

===Regulations===

Many countries do not require labeling of gluten containing products, but in several countries (especially Australia and the European Union) new product labeling standards are enforcing the labeling of gluten-containing ingredients.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] In the United States, gluten may not be listed on the labels of certain foods because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has classified gluten as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=184.1322|title= Sec. 184.1322 Wheat gluten|publisher= Code of Federal Regulations Center|author= |date= April 1, 2007[/tpl] In the United Kingdom, only cereals currently need to be labeled regarding gluten, while other products are voluntary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/labelamendguid21nov05.pdf|date=November 2005|title=Guidance Notes on the Food Labeling (Amendment)(No. 2) Regulations 2004|publisher=Food Standards Agency|format=PDF[/tpl]  For example, most British sausages contain Butcher's Rusk, a grain-derived food additive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/meatproductguidancescot.pdf|title=Labelling and Composition of Meat Products|publisher=Food Standards Agency|date=April 22, 2004|accessdate=February 23, 2008|format=PDF[/tpl] Furthermore, while UK companies selling food prepared on their own premises are given guidance by the Food Standards Agency, they are not required to meet any labeling requirements.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7191651.stm|title=Food allergy guidance published|date=January 16, 2008|accessdate=February 24, 2008|publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
Regulation of the label gluten-free varies. The current international Codex Alimentarius standard allows for 20 parts per million of gluten in so-called "gluten-free" foods for foodstuffs that are considered naturally gluten-free and 200 ppm for foodstuffs rendered gluten-free.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Bermudo Redondo | first1 = M.

==Celiac disease and other medical reason==

Celiac disease is the primary reason that one would switch to a gluten-free diet. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease, affecting about 1% of all Americans. In patients with celiac disease, gluten causes the immune system to attack the intestinal lining of the small intestine. Over time this then triggers the small intestine to lose the ability to absorb nutrients into the body, such as fiber and vitamins. If gone untreated the lack of nutrients can initiate other health problems that include osteoporosis, iron-deficiency anemia, other autoimmune disorders, extreme fatigue, infertility, neurological problems and, in rare cases, lymphoma of the small intestine. Symptoms rarely occur, but if they do, they include diarrhea, anemia, bone pain, and a severe skin rash called dermatitis herpetiformis. Because of the lack of symptoms, it is believed only five to ten percent of people with celiac disease are diagnosed.
Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a type of celiac disease that causes the immune system to attack the skin rather than the small intestine. When it attacks the skin it produces inflammation, irritation, redness. This creates a chronic itchy and bumpy rash to appear. Typically, this appears after the intake of gluten. People with DH are advised to adhere to a gluten-free diet. 
Gluten sensitivity is the inability and trouble for a person to metabolize gluten. This results in digestive distress, which can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, gas, bloating, constipation, and bowel discomfort. These digestive symptoms occur after the intake of gluten. Gluten sensitivity is far less severe and does not appear to have any long term effects. A reduced-gluten or gluten-free diet is suggested to prevent the discomfort.

==Popularity and nonceliac health effects==

Gluten-free fad diets have become popular. This may be because celiac disease was under diagnosed or because people are "unnecessarily turning to the diet as a food fad". There appears to be an increased incidence of celiac disease, with one study which looked for antibodies from 1950s American blood samples finding that celiac disease is about four times more common now as it was then.[tpl]cite web|author=July 31, 2012, 5: 13 PM |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57483789-10391704/gluten-free-diet-fad-are-celiac-disease-rates-actually-rising/ |title=Gluten-free diet fad: Are celiac disease rates actually rising? |publisher=CBS News |date=2012-07-31 |accessdate=2013-12-06[/tpl] Many are adopting gluten-free diets to treat celiac disease-like symptoms in the absence of a positive test for celiac disease.
A 2011 panel of celiac experts concluded that there is a condition related to gluten other than celiac disease and named it "non-celiac gluten sensitivity".Gluten-Free, Whether You Need It or Not. New York Times. However, for those without celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the diet may be unnecessary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.andjrnl.org/article/S2212-2672(12)00743-5/fulltext |title=Elsevier |publisher=Andjrnl.org |accessdate=2013-12-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Oct. 18, 2012 Sarah Auffret, Arizona State University |url=http://westernfarmpress.com/management/gluten-free-fad-not-backed-science |title=Gluten-free fad not backed by science | Management content from |publisher=Western Farm Press |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2013-12-06[/tpl] There are a wide variety of names which have been used in medical literature for gluten-related disorders which are different from celiac disease. Some of them are confusing and ambiguous. "Non-celiac gluten sensitivity" is the recommended umbrella term for conditions where symptoms different from celiac disease result from ingestion of gluten.[tpl]cite journal|coauthors=Daniel A Leffler, Julio C Bai, Federico Biagi, Alessio Fasano, Peter H R Green, Marios Hadjivassiliou, Katri Kaukinen, Ciaran P Kelly, Jonathan N Leonard, Knut Erik Aslaksen Lundin, Joseph A Murray, David S Sanders, Marjorie M Walker, Fabiana Zingone, Carolina Ciacci|title=The Oslo definitions for coeliac disease and related terms|journal=Gut|date=February 16, 2012|volume=62|issue=1|pages=43–52|doi=10.1136/gutjnl-2011-301346|url=http://gut.bmj.com/content/62/1/43.full.pdf|accessdate=February 5, 2013|author=Jonas F Ludvigsson|publisher=BMJ and British Society of Gastroenterology|quote=CD was defined as ‘a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals’.

Despite some advocacy, evidence of the diet's efficacy as an autism treatment is poor.[tpl]cite journal| author=Millward C, Ferriter M, Calver S, Connell-Jones G| title=Gluten- and casein-free diets for autistic spectrum disorder. | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | year= 2008 | volume=  | issue= 2 | pages= CD003498 | pmid=18425890 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003498.pub3 | pmc= | url=| editor1-last=Ferriter| editor1-first=Michael [/tpl] Despite vigorous marketing, a variety of studies, including a study by the University of Rochester, found that the popular autism diet does not demonstrate behavioral improvement and fails to show any genuine benefit to children diagnosed with autism who do not also have a known digestive condition which benefits from a gluten-free diet.
In addition to false diagnoses, the gluten-free diet fad has become misunderstood in the eyes of the average person. Many believe that a gluten-free diet is healthier for them. Gluten alone does not contain specific nutritional value, however, many grains, especially whole grains, that have gluten in them are beneficial. These whole grains are enriched with minerals, vitamins, and fiber. Carbohydrates make up just over half of a healthy diet. A healthy diet recommends that half of a person’s carbohydrates should come from whole grains. There are some whole grains that do not contain gluten, such as quinoa or millet. Although gluten-free foods may have some fiber and/or nutrients that are found in their gluten versions, they tend have fewer fiber and nutrients, while using sugar and fat to make up for the absence of gluten. People may also take supplements for the lack of nutrients. Yet, food is the best source for the body to absorb nutrients. People also believe that a gluten-free diet will help them to lose weight. While cutting out any food group allows someone to lose weight more quickly, it cuts out the healthy nutrients for a balanced diet.[tpl]cite web|last=Berl|first=Rachel|title=Gluten-Free Diet|url=http://health.usnews.com/best-diet/gluten-free-diet|work=US News|publisher=U.S. News and World Report|accessdate=30 March 2014[/tpl]

==Deficiencies linked to maintaining a gluten-free diet==

Many gluten-free products are not fortified or enriched by such nutrients as folate, iron, and fiber as traditional breads and cereals have been during the last century. Additionally, because gluten-free products are not always available, many gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) patients do not consume the recommended number of grain servings per day. People who change their standard gluten-free diet to implement gluten-free oats at breakfast, high fiber brown rice bread at lunch, and quinoa as a side at dinner have been found to have significant increases in protein (20.6 g versus 11 g), iron (18.4 mg versus 1.4 mg), calcium (182 mg versus 0 mg), and fiber (12.7 g versus 5 g). The B vitamin group did not have significant increases, but were still found to have improved values of thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and folate.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lee AR, Ng DL, Dave E, Ciaccio J, Green PHR | title = The effect of substituting alternative grains in the diet on the nutritional profile of the gluten-free diet | journal = Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics | volume = 22 | pages = 359–363 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19519750 | issue = 4 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2009.00970.x [/tpl] These dietary changes can greatly reduce a GSE patient's risk for anemia (especially iron deficiency anemia) and low blood calcium levels or poor bone health.
