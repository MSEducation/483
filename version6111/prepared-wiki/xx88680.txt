Punta rock or Belizean punta is a form of the traditional punta rhythm of the Garifuna people of Honduras, Belize, and Guatemala. Although most artist and bands are exclusively Garifuna, songs are usually in Kriol or Garifuna and rarely in Spanish, or English.

==Origins==

Punta rock was created by Pen Cayetano in Belize in 1978. Punta, as a genre, is the music of the Garifuna people who came from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and 
Dominica exiled by the British into Roatan, Bay Islands, Honduras. Garifuna then spread out to Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Belize. 
While this style is unique, calypso and soca have had slight influences on it. Like calypso and soca, Belizean punta was used for both social commentary and risqu√© humor, though the initial wave of punta acts eschewed the former. Lord Rhaburn and the Cross Culture Band were integral in the acceptance of punta by Belizeans (namely Kriols) by actually doing calypso songs about punta such as "Gumagrugu Watah" and "Punta Rock Eena Babylon".
Punta rock was brought to the U.S by Ideal Castillo. Ideal had learned punta rock with 
Chukupen Paulino and played with the original Larunihati Band (featured in the movie "The Mosquito Coast"). Ideal later met up with Pen Cayetano and Mohobub Flores in Dangriga and for awhile was the youngest member of the Pen Cayetano's Turtle Shell Band. When Ideal came to the United States, he introduced Punta Rock to the Garifuna people living in the Bronx.He formed the legendary punta rock band Isanigu Punta Rock Soul-Jahs.
