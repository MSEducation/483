==Member Clubs==

As of season 2011/2012, the Central Scottish had 37 member clubs, listed below alongside links to the individual team's website where available.

==League Setup==

The Central Scottish AFL is split into two divisions, a Premier League of 12 teams and a 25-strong Division 1 (split into Division 1A and 1B).  The bottom two teams from the Premier League are automatically relegated to Division 1, being replaced by the winners of each of the two sections, and the team which finishes 3rd from bottom is entered into a round-robin playoff with the two teams who finished second in each of Division 1A and Division 1B - the winner secures a place in the Premier League.  Division 1 sections are determined by a draw at the association's Annual General Meeting.
