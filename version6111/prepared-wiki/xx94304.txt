Spirit of Peoria is a riverboat that normally runs in the Peoria, Illinois area on the Illinois River watershed. The boat participated in the 2004 Grand Excursion. Spirit of Peoria is a true paddleboat, actually using its paddlewheel for propulsion, unlike some modern riverboats with purely cosmetic wheels.
The boat was designed by architect Alan Bates, and built in 1988 at the Walker Boat Yard in Paducah, Kentucky, making it the first paddleboat vessel built there. The propulsion system was designed by Norm Rittenhouse, with steering by Custom Hydraulics.
Spirit of Peoria has no propellers or thrusters, and is powered by twin Caterpillar 3412 diesel gensets, producing 700 kilowatts combined in 208 volt 3-phase voltage. The power is rectified using railroad-style rectifiers, probably from a GM GP38. The DC voltage goes to two traction engines, also from a GM locomotive, which drive the paddlewheel via two [tpl]convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-long[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|1|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide[/tpl] chains. This allows the boat to be comparatively fast and efficient, burning approximately [tpl]convert|15|USgal|l[/tpl] of diesel fuel an hour, with a top speed of over [tpl]convert|15|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The dry weight is about 275 tons,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spiritofpeoria.com/info/about-the-boat/ |title=About the Boat |website=Spirit of Peoria |accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl] with a passenger capacity of 487. The boat carries [tpl]convert|3500|USgal|l[/tpl] of fuel and [tpl]convert|2500|USgal|l[/tpl] of water. 
The regular area of travel of the boat ranges from Pere Marquette State Park near Grafton, Illinois to Starved Rock State Park near Ottawa, Illinois. The boat is owned and captained by G. Alex Grieves, and co-captained by Harold Breitenbach.
