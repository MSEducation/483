From Now On... is a solo studio album by former Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Trapeze bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes. It was released in 1994 and had a distinctive AOR sound.

==History==

From Now On... was Hughes’ second solo release after finding his ‘higher power’ and kicking the drug habits that had marred his career throughout the late 70s and 80s.
The album was recorded in Sweden in the Nordic Studio Lab and had its initial release just within that country. It was subsequently released in Japan, Europe and America.
It is notable that From Now On… is the only Glenn Hughes studio album which features no bass playing from Hughes himself (a situation that apparently made him uncomfortable in Black Sabbath), claiming that he wanted a ‘knees up without the bass’.http://dmme.net/interviews/hughes1.html
Hughes was supported by a band of Swedish musicians including Europe members John Levén, Mic Michaeli and Ian Haugland as well as guitarists Thomas Larsson and Eric Bojfeldt. Swedish singer/songwriter Meja also contributed backing-vocals to the track If You Don't Want Me To. The album also featured the songs You Were Always There and Devil In You which were originally written for the abandoned follow up to the Hughes/Thrall album.
The US release included a new version of the Deep Purple song Burn, while the Japanese release featured both Burn and a new version of another Deep Purple track, You Keep On Moving originally featured on Come Taste the Band.
A live album entitled Burning Japan Live was taken from the From Now On... tour.
