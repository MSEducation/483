[[Discipline]]

CATEGORIES: Training, Behavior modification

In its natural sense, discipline is systematic instruction intended to train a person, sometimes literally called a disciple, in a craft, trade or other activity, or to follow a particular code of conduct or "order". Often, the phrase "to discipline" carries a negative connotation. This is because enforcement of order–that is, ensuring instructions are carried out–is often regulated through punishment. 
Discipline is a course of actions leading to certain goal or ideal. A disciplined person is one that has established a goal and is willing to achieve that goal at the expense of his or her individuality.
Discipline is the assertion of willpower over more base desires, and is usually understood to be synonymous with self control. Self-discipline is to some extent a substitute for motivation, when one uses reason to determine the best course of action that opposes one's desires. Virtuous behavior is when one's motivations are aligned with one's reasoned aims: to do what one knows is best and to do it gladly. Content behavior, on the other hand, is when one does what one knows is best, but must do it by opposing one's motivations.[tpl]cite book |last=Fowers |first=Blaine J. |year=2008 |title=From Continence to Virtue: Recovering Goodness, Character Unity, and Character Types for Positive Psychology |work=Theory & Psychology |volume=18, |issue=5 |pages=629–653[/tpl] Moving from content to virtuous behavior requires training and some self-discipline.
