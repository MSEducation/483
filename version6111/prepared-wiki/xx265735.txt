[[Lillian's Yellow (tomato)]]

CATEGORIES: Heirloom tomato cultivars

Lillian's Yellow Tomato is a unique variety of heirloom tomato collected some years ago by Lillian Bruce of Tennessee. Lillian passed the seed on to Robert Richardson, after which it found its way into the Seed Savers Exchange yearbook. One of the few bright yellow fruited varieties, and the only one with potato leaf foliage, this is a delicious, full flavored tomato that is very meaty, with few seeds. It tends to be a late season variety.[tpl]cite book|last=Male|first=Carolyn|title=100 Heirloom Tomatoes for the American Garden|isbn=0761114009|page=134,152,246[/tpl]
