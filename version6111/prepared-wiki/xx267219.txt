In 1850–52 Draper took the arts course, and in 1855–57 the medical course, in New York University, and then studied in Europe. He was professor of natural sciences (1858–60) and of analytical and practical chemistry (1858–71) in New York University, and in 1859 was professor of chemistry in Cooper Union. From 1863 to 1885 he was professor of physiology and natural history in the College of the City of New York; in 1865–85, professor of chemistry in the medical department of New York University; and in 1864 was surgeon of a regiment in service. In 1873 he received the degree of Doctor of Laws from Trinity College. Draper died suddenly, of pneumonia which he caught during a cold winter. He was serving his duties just a few days before death.
