The 2009 event, planned for Bochum, was cancelled; a year later, the deaths of twenty-one attendees at the Duisburg venue prompted the parade's organiser Rainer Schaller to declare an end to the festival.  "The Love Parade has always been a peaceful party, but it will forever be overshadowed by the accident, so out of respect for the victims the Love Parade will never take place again," Schaller said.
The parade was one of the oldest and largest festivals of electronic music, together with Zürich's Streetparade, Mayday and Nature One.

==Setup==

The music played at the events was predominantly electronic dance music — in this case mainly trance, house, techno, and schranz music. Attempts to introduce other music styles, such as hip hop, have failed. Hardcore and gabber music were part of the parade in early years, but were later removed. They are now celebrated separately on a counter-demonstration called "Fuckparade".
The parade was seen to be louder and more crowded than most concerts. With its water-cooled sound systems on every truck, the parade produced an extremely loud sound floor.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] After the 2001 arrangement, veterinarians at the Berlin Zoo blamed the parade for giving more than half of its animals diarrhea. Chairman Heiner Kloes said veterinarians told him the heavy bass was to blame for disturbing the animals.visited 25 July 2010. The parade consisted of the sound trucks that usually featured local, or important, clubs and their DJs. It had become a rule that only trucks that had sponsors from a techno-related field, such as clubs, labels or stores, were allowed, but advertising space was increased after the 2006 event to offset the high costs of equipping a truck.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl] The trucks were usually open on top and feature dancers, with box-systems mounted on the side or rear.
The parade was a place where some exhibited and enjoyed other people's exhibitionist tendencies. Some attendees enjoyed carrying around toys such or other items such as dummies (pacifiers) or face masks. Often the crowd was imaginative in terms of clothing (or lack thereof) and appearance. In some cases, participants proceeded to sex acts, including masturbation, heterosexual and homosexual oral sex, and heterosexual sexual intercourse, as well as use of sex toys and participation in fetish-related sexual acts such as golden showers, often in the public in front of passers-by and cameras, as indicated by videos circulating on-line.
One famous picture from the parade is people sitting and dancing on streetlamps, trees, commercial signs, telephone booths, which gave the event's nickname "the greatest amateur circus on earth".http://en.rian.ru/world/20100724/159936810.html
The finale of the demonstration is by the so-called "Abschlusskundgebung" which are half-hour sets of the world's leading top DJs such as DJ Tiesto, Paul Van Dyk, Carl Cox, Armin Van Buuren, DJ Rush, DJ Hell, Westbam, Drum Connection, Miss Djax, Marusha or Chris Liebing. During this time all trucks (usually about 40) are connected to each other and set online to the statue of victory where the turntables are. This is one of the few chances a DJ can ever have to play for a crowd of about one million people.

==Disturbances==

The parade was quite peaceful for an event of its size, seeing few arrests. In 2008, for example, charges were pressed for six  robberies, three sexually related offences and forty thefts. Twenty-three participants were caught with drugs and forty-nine were charged with bodily harm. There were 177 parade visitors provisionally arrested by the police.[ref]

In 2000, after the parade, a girl under the influence of ecstasy was run over by an S-Bahn after she had been leaning on the door too hard.

==2010 accident==

At the 2010 Love Parade in Duisburg, the number of people attending allegedly reached 1.4 million – the original expectation was around 800,000 – whereas police believed around 400,000 people were present.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,708676,00.html |title=Love Parade Tragedy: No Resignations, Just Unanswered Questions – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News – International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=24 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010[/tpl] 21 people were killed, and more than 500 injured, in an incident near an overcrowded tunnel leading into the festival. At least 20 casualties resulted from suffocation, caused by crowd pressure.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
So far nobody has been held financially responsible for this tragic event and the gathering of at least twice the capacity of people at the Duisburg grounds, and German authorities are no longer searching for those who took large profits.
Safety experts and a fire service investigator had previously warned that the site was not suitable for the numbers expected to attend.Connolly, Kate (25 July 2010).  "Prosecutors Investigate 'Ignored' Safety Warnings after 19 Die in Love Parade Crush — Organisers Allowed Just One Entrance to Music Festival Grounds for Expected Crowd of 1.4 Million, Witnesses Say".  The Guardian. Retrieved 27 July 2010. Rainer Schaller, the festival's organizer and chief executive officer, later said the festival would not continue in future, thus ending the festival.
A preliminary investigation of the ministry of the interior placed heavy blame on the organizers around Rainer Schaller. Schaller in turn claimed that errors by the police in controlling streams of visitors led to the accident.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rhein-zeitung.de/nachrichten/deutschland-und-welt_artikel,-Jetzt-21-Tote-durch-Loveparade-Katastrophe-_arid,117302.html |title=Jetzt 21 Tote durch Loveparade-Katastrophe – Deutschland & Welt – Rhein-Zeitung |publisher=Rhein-zeitung.de |date= |accessdate=28 July 2010[/tpl]

==Love Parade International==

There are similar festivals in other cities like Zürich's Street Parade, Geneva's Lake Parade, Rotterdam's FFWD Dance Parade and Love Parades in Vienna.In 1994, 1995 and 1996, Love Parade was held in Melbourne, Australia. This was a smaller "rave party" version of the festival. In 1996 it was held at Festival Hall in  West Melbourne. This party was followed by a parade that made the evening news. It was followed by a parade In 1997, a Love Parade was held in Sydney, Australia. Unlike its overseas counterparts, however, it was a smaller "rave party" version of the festival, held at the infamous Graffiti Hall of Fame in Redfern. SEPTEMBER 21, 1999 AND 2000 IN Buenos Aires, Argentina, IS AT THE LOVE PARADE ARGENTINA better known as, "Buenos Aires ENERGY PARADE" (THE LOVE PARADE OF LATIN AMERICA) under the theme, LOVE, PEACE AND DANCE.

In 2001, the official UK parade had moved to Newcastle upon Tyne which was to have seen a parade through the streets of Newcastle before ending up on Town Moor but was cancelled after the police refused a license: BBC Radio 1 still hosted a more contained event, however.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/loveparade/love_parade_newcastle_2001.shtml |title=Tyne – Love Parade |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=28 July 2010[/tpl]  Since then no Love Parade had taken place in the United Kingdom. In Summer 2000 one of the first public events took place in post-war Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, was Futura, Festival of Electronic Music. Some of the world's most famous DJs, including the organizers of the Berlin Love Parade, performed in a bombed and burnt out factory.
After being held in the North-American Continent for the first time in Mexico (2002), in the fall of 2004, the Love Parade was held in San Francisco. They had held their inaugural Parade in September 2004 with 37,000 attending. The parade was held again in San Francisco in September 2005 as a rousing success drawing over 50–60,000 people. In 2006, the parade was held on 23 September and was renamed Love Fest because the Loveparade Berlin organization did not renew any of their worldwide licenses not already under contract so they could focus on their own event. 2009 was the biggest success of LOVEVOLUTION (formerly Lovefest/Love Parade) with over 100,000 people.

==Legal issues==

Under German law the state has to pay for security during political demonstrations as well as cleaning up the streets after the demonstration.John Borneman & Stefan Senders, "Politics without a Head: Is the "Love Parade" a New Form of Political Identification?" Cultural Anthropology J5(2) 294-31, American Anthropological Association. 2000 In the case of a commercial event however, the organizer must cover these expenses. For a large event like the Love Parade the costs are quite high: an estimated €300,000 to €400,000.
The Love Parade was initially held as a "political demonstration" to save costs; however it is organized by two companies set up just for the Love Parade. Due to this there was a dispute between the organizers and the city of Berlin every year about the status of the Love Parade and who should bear what costs. Finally in 2001, the courts ruled that the Love Parade had to be held as commercial event.Florian Mayer, "Origins, Commodification, and Significance of Berlin's Love Parade" GRIN Verlag, 2007. ISBN 978-3638815796

==Anthems==

Every German parade has had its own anthem.

The "Participants" figure is the estimate given by the organizers. Police estimates have been as much as 30% lower. The numbers of the Ruhr Love Parades have probably been tripled.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mmnews.de/index.php/etc/6099-alle-loveparade-besucherzahlen-gefaescht |title=Alle Loveparade-Besucherzahlen gefäscht |publisher=Mmnews.de |date=2010-07-29 |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl] Accurate counts are not available since entry is free and uncontrolled.
