CATEGORIES: Railway lines in South Korea

The Daegu Line is a railway line in South Korea.  The line connects Dongdaegu Station on the Gyeongbu Line in Daegu to Yeongcheon on the Jungang Line.  The line is served by frequent passenger trains between Seoul (via the Gyeongbu Line), Dongdaegu, and Gyeongju, Pohang, and Ulsan (via the Jungang and Donghae Nambu Lines).

==History==

The first section of the Daegu Line was opened on November 1, 1917, between Dongdaegu and Hayang.  The line was extended to Pohang on October 31, 1918.  A branch was opened from Gyeongju to Ulsan on October 25, 1921. 
The sections from Gyeongju to Pohang and Ulsan were integrated into the Donghae Nambu Line on December 16, 1935; later the section from Yeongcheon to Gyeongju became part of the Jungang Line, which was established on April 1, 1942.

===Upgrade===

The [tpl]convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] section from Dongdaegu to Cheongcheon was replaced by a new alignment that takes the Daegu Line to meet the Gyeongbu Line at Gacheon, lengthening the Dongdaegu–Cheongcheon line distance to [tpl]convert|16.5|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.silvernews.or.kr/?inc=newsview&no=675&s=14&ss=0&sss=0 |title=대구선 일부구간 이설 개통 |language=Korean |date=2005-11-14 |publisher=Silvernet News |accessdate=2010-12-04[/tpl] The Dongdaegu to Cheongcheon rail distance changed to [tpl]convert|38.4|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl], line proper from Gacheon to Yeongcheon is [tpl]convert|29.0|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long.[tpl]cite web |url=http://info.korail.com/2007/kra/ope/ope08000/w_ope08606.jsp |title=경영원칙 > 경영공시 > 영업현황 > 영업거리현황 |publisher=Korail |accessdate=2010-12-04[/tpl]  The project was launched in August 1997 with a planned completion in 2000, but economic difficulties and planning changes delayed completion, the line relocation was finally inaugurated on November 3, 2005.  Part of the project was the replacement of a [tpl]convert|1.3|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] branch to Daegu Airport from the old alignment with a [tpl]convert|9.04|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] spur line paralleling the highway west from Cheongcheon to the airport, finished a year later.
The Daegu Line was considered for an upgrade to a double-tracked, electrified railway in a straighter, [tpl]convert|34.9|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long alignment from 2000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.krnetwork.or.kr/service/condition/RouteMapView.do?PA_MAP_ID=12414 |title=대구선 복선전철 |publisher=Korea Rail Network Authority |accessdate=2010-10-24[/tpl]  Detailed plans were prepared by 2009, the foreseen budget was 988.042 billion won, and the completion of the project was set for 2017.  On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020.
