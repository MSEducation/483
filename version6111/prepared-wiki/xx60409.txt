Brussels Airport [tpl]Airport codes|BRU|EBBR[/tpl] (also called [tpl]lang|nl|Brussel Nationaal[/tpl]/[tpl]lang|fr|Bruxelles-National[/tpl]/Brussel-Zaventem (Brussels National)) is an international airport [tpl]convert|6|NM|abbr=on|lk=in[/tpl] northeast of Brussels, the capital of Belgium. In 2013, over 19 million passengers arrived or departed at Brussels Airport, making it the 25th busiest airport in Europe.
The airport is located partially in Zaventem, partially in the Diegem area of Machelen,"bedrijf.jpg." Retrieved on 25 April 2010. and partially in Steenokkerzeel, in the Flemish Region of Belgium. It is home to around 260 companies, together directly employing 20,000 people. The company operating the airport is known as "The Brussels Airport Company N.V./S.A."; before 19 October 2006, the name was BIAC (Brussels International Airport Company), which was created by Belgian law through a merger of BATC with the ground operations departments of the RLW/RVA. Since 2011, the airport is owned by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (39%), Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund I and Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund III (36%) and the Belgian State (25%).Moody's

==History==

The origins of Brussels Airport at Zaventem date back to 1940, when the German occupying force laid claim to [tpl]convert|600|ha|abbr=on[/tpl] of agricultural fields reserved as back-up airfield "Steenokkerzeel". There, the Luftwaffe established Fliegerhorst Melsbroek and constructed 3 runways in the shape of a triangle: runway 02/20, runway 07L/25R (both of which are still in use today) and runway 12/30. The airfield buildings however were constructed within the territory of the nearby municipality of Melsbroek and not of Zaventem, which is why the airfield was known to the locals as the airfield of Melsbroek, or "Fliegerhorst Melsbroek" to the Germans. There is an urban legend that the site of the airport was chosen by the Germans after asking locals where to build it – the Belgians then pointed to this location as it was often foggy.
After the liberation (3 September 1944), the German infrastructure at Melsbroek fell into the hands of the British. When the old civilian airport in Haren became too small, the Belgian authorities decided to use the aerodrome at Melsbroek for the new national airport. By 1948, a new terminal building was constructed to replace the old wooden building. In the same year, the length of both runways 02/20 and 07L/25R were increased to [tpl]convert|1200|m|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|2450|m|abbr=on[/tpl] respectively, whereas 12/30 remained at [tpl]convert|1300|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. The civil aerodrome of Melsbroek was officially opened by Prince Charles, Count of Flanders, the Prince Regent on 20 July 1948. From 1948 to 1956 many more buildings and facilities were erected, but almost always on the Melsbroek side of the site.
In 1955, a train line connecting the city centre of Brussels with the airport was constructed. The line was officially opened by King Baudouin on 15 May 1955.
In 1956 a new [tpl]convert|2300|m|abbr=on[/tpl] runway was constructed, the 07R/25L which runs parallel with 07L/25R. The runway is still in use today and saw its length later increased to [tpl]convert|3200|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. In April 1956 the Belgian government decided to build a new airport, using the same runways, but with the buildings located within the territory of the municipality of Zaventem. In April 1957, construction started of the new terminal, preparing the airport for the 1958 World Fair. The grass runway 12/30 had to make way to allow for the new passenger terminal. This new airport was inaugurated 5 July 1958, almost just in time for the 1958 World Fair. So historically, the birth date of Zaventem Airport is 5 July 1958. Incidentally, the buildings on the Melsbroek side are still in use by the Belgian Air Force (15th Air Transport Wing), and is still known as Melsbroek airfield. Both Zaventem Airport and Melsbroek Air Base, the military airfield, share the same runways.
During the boom of commercial aviation in the 1960s and 1970s, several hangars were constructed. A new cargo terminal was constructed in 1976. In 1994, a brand new terminal was constructed adjacent to the old 1958 building. Two old piers were torn down and replaced by modern ones. In 2002, amidst the turmoil engulfing the demise of the national airline Sabena, a new pier was opened.
In 2005, the airport was awarded Best Airport in Europe by Airports Council International/International Air Transport Association (ACI/IATA), based on a survey conducted with over 100,000 passengers worldwide. Brussels Airport continues to appear in top airports lists as of 2012. Also a direct train link with Leuven and Liège was opened on 12 December 2005.
In 2007, the airport served 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 7% over 2006. The cargo volume in the same year amounted to 780,000 tonnes, an increase of 8.9% over 2006. In 2008, the airport served 18,5 million passengers, which was an increase of 3.7% over the previous year.Expatica: Record numbers of passengers at Brussels Airport
Sabena's demise meant a sharp fall in passenger traffic, a blow the airport only slowly recovered from. The airport's future is threatened by disagreement between the governments of Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region concerning nocturnal air traffic routes.
In March 2009, the old mechanical Flight information display system were replaced by electronic ones.http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/942/Economie/article/detail/782602/2009/03/20/Brussels-Airport-vervangt-borden-met-vluchtinformatie.dhtml In September 2009, CEO Wilfried Van Assche resigned. One of the (unofficial) reasons is the delay of the construction of the low-cost terminal and the possible lawsuit by 52 airlines active at Brussels Airport, because of the tax-discrimination. It was Van Assche who started expanding the Long-Haul network (Jet Airways, Hainan Airlines, Etihad Airways, US Airways) at Brussels Airport. In February 2010 Arnaud Feist was appointed CEO. The company president is Luc Van den Bossche (former Belgian government minister).
On 18 February 2013, in the 2013 Belgium diamond heist, eight men armed with automatic weapons and dressed in police uniforms seized 120 small parcels containing an estimated US$50 million worth of diamonds off of a Helvetic Airways Fokker 100 passenger plane loaded with passengers preparing for departure to Zurich, Switzerland. The men drove two vehicles through a hole they had cut in the airport[tpl]'[/tpl]s perimeter fence to Flight LX789, which had just been loaded with diamonds from a Brink's armored van from Antwerp, Belgium. The men were able to execute the operation within five minutes with no injuries and without firing a shot.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/world/europe/thieves-steal-millions-in-diamonds-at-brussels-airport.html?_r=0 |title=Brazen Jewel Robbery at Brussels Airport Nets $50 Million in Diamonds |accessdate=20 February 2013 |last=Higgins |first=Andrew |date=18 February 2013 |publisher=New York Times[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Casert |first=Raf |url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/19/17013510-robbers-snatch-50-million-of-diamonds-off-plane-in-belgium?lite |title=Casert, Raf, , "Robbers Snatch $50 Million of Diamonds Off Plane in Belgium," Associated Press, February 19, 2013, 4:13 a.m |publisher=Worldnews.nbcnews.com |date=19 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Casert |first=Raf |url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/19/17013510-robbers-snatch-50-million-of-diamonds-off-plane-in-belgium?lite |title=Smith, Vicky, "The Great Plane Robbery: Gang of Fake Police Officers Steal £32m of Diamonds in Airport Heist," Associated Press, February 19, 2013, 18:49 |publisher=Worldnews.nbcnews.com |date=19 February 2013[/tpl]

==Infrastructure==

Brussels Airport uses a one terminal concept, meaning that all the facilities (with the exception of Pier A) are located under a single roof. The terminal building consists of several levels. The railway station is located on -1, busses and taxis arrive at 0, arrivals are located on level 2 and departures on level 3. Levels 2 and 3 are connected to the airport's two piers (A and B).http://www.brusselsairport.be/nl/passngr/at_the_airport/airport_map/

===Departure Halls===

Brussels Airport has two departure halls. The main hall is used by all airlines, with the exception of Jetairfly and Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium. Those two airlines operate from a smaller departure hall next to departure hall 1 as of 30 March 2010. From both the departure halls, both piers can be reached. Brussels Airport currently consists of 54 contact gates, and a total of 109 gates.

===Pier A===

Pier A is the newest pier on Brussels Airport and was opened on 15 May 2002. This pier was destined to support flights from and to the Schengen countries (A-gates). However, since 15 October 2008 all Brussels Airlines flights to African destinions are also handled at this pier. Therefore, border control was installed towards the end of the pier in order to create a new pier. As a result, gates A61-72 were renamed T61-72.
Pier A is connected to the main building via a [tpl]convert|400|m|ft[/tpl] long tunnel under the tarmac. Each pier has its own security zone, so transfer between the terminals involves a security check.
By 2015,http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/corporate/connector/ this tunnel will be replaced by the "Connector", a new building that is to link the main building to Pier A above-ground. The connector will allow passengers to walk straight from the check-in desk to their gate in pier A or B, without changing floors. In the opposite direction, the building will provide the arriving passenger with a smooth and convenient passage to the baggage reclaim hall and the exit.

===Pier B===

Pier B is the oldest pier that is still in use at Brussels Airport and is only used for flighs outside the Schengen Area. Pier B is connected immediately to the main departure hall and consists of two decks. The upper deck (level 3) is at the same level as the departure halls and is used for the departing passengers, whereas the lower deck (level 2) is used for arriving passengers and connects immediately to border control and the baggage claim area.

===Planned===

====Pier A West====

Pier A West is a planned expansion of Pier A, and is meant to relieve Pier B by also handling flights from non-Schengen countries. Pier A West was due to open in 2016, but because of the slow passenger growth, Brussels Airport announced in July 2013 that the works will be delayed until further notice.

====Low-cost pier====

Just as is the case for Pier A West, the construction of a new low-cost pier is currently on hold. It will be built roughly where the old south pier used to be. At present, several low-cost airlines including Ryanair and Wizz Air fly to Brussels-South Charleroi Airport, [tpl]convert|40|km|abbr=on[/tpl] away from Brussels.Shuttles Brussels – Charleroi Airport[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] In autumn 2013, low-cost carrier Pegasus Airlines has announced it will end its flights between Brussels Airport and Turkey. The service between Brussels and Istanbul-Sabiha Gökçen will relocate to Brussels-South Charleroi Airport. However, Turkish Airlines announced on 26 November 2013 it will offer one daily flight on the same route, starting one month after Pegasus terminates its operations at the airport.http://airlineroute.net/2013/11/26/tk-brutxl-s14/ One day later, Ryanair announced the opening of a second Belgian base at Brussels Airport, giving a boost to low-cost traffic at Brussels Airport. Ryanair announced on 27 November 10 new routes from Brussels Airport,http://www.ryanair.com/en/news/ryanair-announces-brussels-zaventem-base-from-feb-2014 although Brussels-South Charleroi Airport will remain the low-cost carrier's primary Belgian base.

==Services==

Shops, bars and restaurants are scattered throughout the building. A small amount of facilities is located in the departure area. These are mostly convenience stores and small shops such as the airport shop, a pharmacy, Relay stores, Starbucks, and so forth. The majority of the facilities, however, can only be accessed after Security control - and are tax free. Several brands and chains have a branch in both piers, however several only operate in pier A.
The airport also features places of worship (for Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Orthodox Christians and Protestants), as well as a place for mediation for humanists.
From December 6, 2013, all passengers have 30 minutes free Wi-Fi access. After this period, passengers can buy additional Wi-Fi access using their credit card. Telenet, Boingo and iPass customers have unlimited free Wi-Fi access at Brussels Airport.
Furthermore, the airport provides meeting facilities and has the ability to host congresses up to 600 participants. These facilities are located either in the Regus Skyport Meeting Center or the Sheraton Brussels Airport Hotel. The latter is also the only hotel located on the airport grounds, opposite the terminal. Shuttle services are provided to 14 nearby hotels.
