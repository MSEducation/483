===Tournament and match rules===

Tournament and match rules deal with factors that may influence the game but are not part of the actual rules of play. Such rules may differ between events. Rules that influence the game include: the setting of compensation points (komi), handicap, and time control parameters. Rules that do not generally influence the game are: the tournament system, pairing strategies, and placement criteria.
Common tournament systems used in Go include the McMahon system,[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.britgo.org/organisers/mcmahon.html | publisher = British Go Association | title = The McMahon system in a nutshell | accessdate = 2008-06-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080518202147/http://www.britgo.org/organisers/mcmahon.html  |archivedate = 2008-05-18[/tpl] Swiss system, league systems and the knockout system. Tournaments may combine multiple systems; many professional Go tournaments use a combination of the league and knockout systems.[tpl]Citation | author = GoGoD (Fairbairn & Hall) | title = A quick guide to pro tournaments | year = 2007 [/tpl]

===Top players===

Although the game was developed in China, the establishment of the Four Go houses by Tokugawa Ieyasu at the start of the 17th century shifted the focus of the Go world to Japan. State sponsorship, allowing players to dedicate themselves full-time to study of the game, and fierce competition between individual houses resulted in a significant increase in the level of play. During this period, the best player of his generation was given the prestigious title Meijin (master) and the post of Godokoro (minister of Go). Of special note are the players who were dubbed Kisei (Go Sage). The only three players to receive this honor were Dosaku, Jowa and Shusaku, all of the house Honinbo.
After the end of the Tokugawa shogunate and the Meiji Restoration period, the Go houses slowly disappeared, and in 1924, the Nihon Ki-in (Japanese Go Association) was formed. Top players from this period often played newspaper-sponsored matches of 2–10 games.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/newspaper.html | title = History of Newspaper Go | last = Fairbairn | first = John | accessdate = 2007-06-14[/tpl] Of special note are the (Chinese-born) player Go Seigen (Chinese: Wu Qingyuan), who scored an impressive 80% in these matches,[tpl]Citation | publisher = GoBase.org | url = http://gobase.org/games/china/misc/disks/matches.html | title = Go Seigen: Match Player | accessdate = 2007-06-14[/tpl] and Minoru Kitani, who dominated matches in the early 1930s.[tpl]Citation | last = Fairbairn | first = John | url = http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/newspaper.html#kitani | title = Kitani's Streak | accessdate = 2007-06-14[/tpl] These two players are also recognized for their groundbreaking work on new opening theory (Shinfuseki).[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/kubomatsu.html | first = John | last = Fairbairn | title = Kubomatsu's central thesis | accessdate = 2008-01-17 [/tpl]
For much of the 20th century, Go continued to be dominated by players trained in Japan. Notable names included Eio Sakata, Rin Kaiho (born in China), Masao Kato, Koichi Kobayashi and Cho Chikun (born Cho Ch'i-hun, South Korea).[tpl]Citation | publisher = GoBase.org | url = http://gobase.org/games/jp/ | title = List of Japanese titles, prizemoney and winners | accessdate = 2008-06-11[/tpl] Top Chinese and Korean talents often moved to Japan, because the level of play there was high and funding was more lavish. One of the first Korean players to do so was Cho Namchul, who studied in the Kitani Dojo 1937–1944. After his return to Korea, the Hanguk Kiwon (Korea Baduk Association) was formed and caused the level of play in South Korea to rise significantly in the second half of the 20th century.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.usgo.org/news/index.php?%23_id=102 | title = KBA Founder Cho Nam Chul passes | first = Janice | last = Kim | publisher = American Go Association | accessdate = 2008-06-11[/tpl] In China, the game declined during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) but quickly recovered in the last quarter of the 20th century, bringing Chinese players, such as Nie Weiping and Ma Xiaochun, on par with their Japanese and Korean counterparts.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cugos/tesuji/weiqi_chinese_culture.html | title = Weiqi in Chinese Culture | last = Matthews | first = Charles | accessdate = 2007-06-04[/tpl]
With the advent of major international titles from 1989 onward, it became possible to compare the level of players from different countries more accurately. Korean players such as Lee Chang-ho, Cho Hunhyun, Lee Sedol and Yoo Changhyuk dominated international Go and won an impressive number of titles.[tpl]Citation | publisher = GoBase.org | url = http://gobase.org/games/nn/ | title = List of International titles, prizemoney and winners | accessdate = 2008-06-11[/tpl] Several Chinese players also rose to the top in international Go, most notably Ma Xiaochun, Chang Hao and Gu Li. [tpl]As of|2013[/tpl], Japan lags behind in the international Go scene.
Historically, as with most sports and games, more men than women have played Go. Special tournaments for women exist, but until recently, men and women did not compete together at the highest levels; however, the creation of new, open tournaments and the rise of strong female players, most notably Rui Naiwei, have in recent years highlighted the strength and competitiveness of emerging female players.[tpl]citation | first = Peter | last = Shotwell | title = Go! More Than a Game | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-8048-3475-X[/tpl]
The level in other countries has traditionally been much lower, except for some players who had preparatory professional training in Asia.Kaku Takagawa toured Europe around 1970, and reported (Go Review) a general standard of amateur 4 dan. This is a good amateur level but no more than might be found in ordinary Asian clubs. Published current European ratings would suggest around 100 players stronger than that, with very few European 7 dans. Knowledge of the game has been scant elsewhere up until the 20th century. A famous player of the 1920s was Edward Lasker.European Go has been documented by Franco Pratesi, Eurogo (Florence 2003) in three volumes, up to 1920, 1920–1950, and 1950 and later. It was not until the 1950s that more than a few Western players took up the game as other than a passing interest. In 1978, Manfred Wimmer became the first Westerner to receive a professional player's certificate from an Asian professional Go association.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.britgo.org/bgj/04112.html | title =Wimmer, Kerwin, Make Professional Shodan | publisher = British Go Association | accessdate = 2008-06-11[/tpl] In 2000, a Westerner, Michael Redmond, finally achieved the top rank awarded by an Asian Go association, 9 dan. In total, [tpl]As of|2008|lc=on[/tpl], only nine non-Asian Go players have ever achieved professional status in Asian associations.

==Equipment==

It is possible to play Go with a simple paper board and coins or plastic tokens for the stones. More popular midrange equipment includes cardstock, a laminated particle board, or wood boards with stones of plastic or glass. More expensive traditional materials are still used by many players.The most expensive Go sets have black stones carved from slate and white stones carved from translucent white shells, played on boards carved in a single piece from the trunk of a tree.

===Traditional equipment===

====Boards====

The Go board (generally referred to by its Chinese name goban (碁盤)) typically measures between [tpl]convert|45|and|48|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] in length (from one player's side to the other) and [tpl]convert|42|to|44|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] in width. Chinese boards are slightly larger, as a traditional Chinese Go stone is slightly larger to match. The board is not square; there is a 15:14 ratio in length to width, because with a perfectly square board, from the player's viewing angle the perspective creates a foreshortening of the board. The added length compensates for this.Fairbairn 1992 pp. 142–143 There are two main types of boards: a table board similar in most respects to other gameboards like that used for chess, and a floor board, which is its own free-standing table and at which the players sit.
The traditional Japanese goban is between [tpl]convert|10|and|18|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] thick and has legs; it sits on the floor (see picture to right). It is preferably made from the rare golden-tinged Kaya tree (Torreya nucifera), with the very best made from Kaya trees up to 700 years old. More recently, the related California Torreya (Torreya californica) has been prized for its light color and pale rings as well as its reduced expense and more readily available stock. The natural resources of Japan have been unable to keep up with the enormous demand for the slow-growing Kaya trees; both T. nucifera and T. californica take many hundreds of years to grow to the necessary size, and they are now extremely rare, raising the price of such equipment tremendously. As Kaya trees are a protected species in Japan, they cannot be harvested until they have died. Thus, an old-growth, floor-standing Kaya goban can easily cost in excess of US$10,000 with the highest-quality examples costing more than $60,000.[tpl]citation | url=http://www.kiseido.com/clearance.htm | title = Kiseido clearance sale[/tpl] lists the regular price for a Shihomasa Kaya Go Board with legs ([tpl]convert|20.4|cm|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl] thick) as $60,000+
Other, less expensive woods often used to make quality table boards in both Chinese and Japanese dimensions include Hiba (Thujopsis dolabrata), Katsura (Cercidiphyllum japonicum), Kauri (Agathis), and Shin Kaya (various varieties of spruce, commonly from Alaska, Siberia and China's Yunnan Province).Fairbairn 1992 pp. 143–149 So-called Shin Kaya is a potentially confusing merchant's term: shin means "new", and thus shin kaya is best translated "faux kaya", because the woods so described are biologically unrelated to Kaya.

====Stones====

A full set of Go stones (goishi) usually contains 181 black stones and 180 white ones; a 19×19 grid has 361 points, so there are enough stones to cover the board, and Black gets the extra odd stone because that player goes first.
Traditional Japanese stones are double-convex, and made of clamshell (white) and slate (black).Fairbairn 1992 pp. 150–153 The classic slate is nachiguro stone mined in Wakayama Prefecture and the clamshell from the Hamaguri clam; however, due to a scarcity in the Japanese supply of this clam, the stones are most often made of shells harvested from Mexico. Historically, the most prized stones were made of jade, often given to the reigning emperor as a gift.
In China, the game is traditionally played with single-convex stones made of a composite called Yunzi. The material comes from Yunnan Province and is made by sintering a proprietary and trade-secret mixture of mineral compounds derived from the local stone. This process dates to the Tang Dynasty and, after the knowledge was lost in the 1920s during the Chinese Civil War, was rediscovered in the 1960s by the now state-run Yunzi company. The material is praised for its colors, its pleasing sound as compared to glass or to synthetics such as melamine, and its lower cost as opposed to other materials such as slate/shell. The term "yunzi" can also refer to a single-convex stone made of any material; however, most English-language Go suppliers specify Yunzi as a material and single-convex as a shape to avoid confusion, as stones made of Yunzi are also available in double-convex while synthetic stones can be either shape.
Traditional stones are made so that black stones are slightly larger in diameter than white; this is to compensate for the optical illusion created by contrasting colors that would make equal-sized white stones appear larger on the board than black stones.See Overshoot in Western typography for similar subtle adjustment to create a uniform appearance.

====Bowls====

The bowls for the stones are shaped like a flattened sphere with a level underside.Fairbairn 1992 pp. 153–155 The lid is loose fitting and upturned before play to receive stones captured during the game. Chinese bowls are slightly larger, and a little more rounded, a style known generally as Go Seigen; Japanese Kitani bowls tend to have a shape closer to that of the bowl of a snifter glass, such as for brandy. The bowls are usually made of turned wood. Mulberry is the traditional material for Japanese bowls, but is very expensive; wood from the Chinese jujube date tree, which has a lighter color (it is often stained) and slightly more visible grain pattern, is a common substitute for rosewood, and traditional for Go Seigen-style bowls. Other traditional materials used for making Chinese bowls include lacquered wood, ceramics, stone and woven straw or rattan. The names of the bowl shapes, "Go Seigen" and "Kitani", were introduced in the last quarter of the 20th century by the professional player Janice Kim as homage to two 20th-century professional Go players by the same names, of Chinese and Japanese nationality, respectively, who are referred to as the "Fathers of modern Go".[tpl]Citation | first = John | last = Fairbairn | url = http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/jowa.html | title = Jowa – Sage or Scoundrel | accessdate=2008-06-11[/tpl]

====Modern and low-cost alternatives====

In clubs and at tournaments, where large numbers of sets must be purchased and maintained by one organization, expensive traditional sets are not usually used. For these situations, table boards are usually used instead of floor boards, and are either made of a lower-cost wood such as spruce or bamboo, or are flexible mats made of vinyl or leather that can be rolled up. In such cases, the stones are usually made of glass, plastic or resin (such as melamine or Bakelite) rather than slate and shell. Bowls are often made of plastic or inexpensive wood.
Common "novice" Go sets are all-inclusive kits made of particle board or plywood, with plastic or glass stones, that either fold up to enclose the stone containers or have pull-out drawers to keep stones. In relative terms, these sets are inexpensive, costing US$20–$40 depending on component quality, and thus are popular with casual Go players. Magnetic sets are also available, either as portable travel sets or in larger sizes for educational purposes.

===Playing technique and etiquette===

The traditional way to place a Go stone is to first take one from the bowl, gripping it between the index and middle fingers, with the middle finger on top, and then placing it directly on the desired intersection.[tpl]Citation | publisher = Nihon Ki-in | url = http://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/lesson/knowledge-e/uchikata-e.htm | title = A stylish way to play your stones | accessdate = 2007-02-24[/tpl] One can also place a stone on the board and then slide it into position under appropriate circumstances (where it doesn't move any other stones). It is considered respectful towards one's opponent to place one's first stone in the upper right-hand corner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://senseis.xmp.net/?PlayingTheFirstMoveInTheUpperRightCorner |title=Sensei's Library: Playing the first move in the upper right corner |publisher=Senseis.xmp.net |date=2011-09-19 |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl]
It is considered poor manners to run one's fingers through one's bowl of unplayed stones, as the sound, however soothing to the player doing this, can be disturbing to one's opponent. Similarly, "clacking" a stone against another stone, the board, or the table or floor is also discouraged. However, it is permissible to emphasize select moves by striking the board more firmly than normal, thus producing a sharp clack.

===Time control===

A game of Go may be timed using a game clock. Formal time controls were introduced into the professional game during the 1920s and were controversial.Bozulich 2001 pp. 92–93 Adjournments and sealed moves began to be regulated in the 1930s. Go tournaments use a number of different time control systems. All common systems envisage a single main period of time for each player for the game, but they vary on the protocols for continuation (in overtime) after a player has finished that time allowance.Roughly, one has the time to play the game and then a little time to finish it off. Time-wasting tactics are possible in Go, so that sudden death systems, in which time runs out at a predetermined point however many plays are in the game, are relatively unpopular (in the West). The most widely used time control system is the so-called byoyomiLiterally in Japanese byōyomi means 'reading of seconds'. system. The top professional Go matches have timekeepers so that the players do not have to press their own clocks.
Two widely used variants of the byoyomi system are:[tpl]Citation | publisher = European Go Federation | url = http://www.eurogofed.org/egf/tourrules.htm | title = EGF General Tournament Rules | accessdate = 2008-06-11[/tpl]

===Notation and recording games===

Go games are recorded with a simple coordinate system. This is comparable to algebraic chess notation, except that Go stones do not move and thus require only one coordinate per turn. Coordinate systems include purely numerical (4-4 point), hybrid (K3), and purely alphabetical.[tpl]cite web|author=Stas Bekman: stas (at) stason.org |url=http://stason.org/TULARC/games/go/5-3-Recording-Go-games.html |title=Go FAQ |publisher=Stason.org |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl] The Smart Game Format uses alphabetical coordinates internally, but most editors represent the board with hybrid coordinates as this reduces confusion. The Japanese word kifu is sometimes used to refer to a game record.
In Unicode, Go stones are encoded in the block Miscellaneous Symbols:

===Nature of the game===

In combinatorial game theory terms, Go is a zero-sum, perfect-information, partisan, deterministic strategy game, putting it in the same class as chess, checkers (draughts) and Reversi (Othello); however it differs from these in its game play. Although the rules are simple, the practical strategy is extremely complex.
The game emphasizes the importance of balance on multiple levels and has internal tensions. To secure an area of the board, it is good to play moves close together; however, to cover the largest area, one needs to spread out, perhaps leaving weaknesses that can be exploited. Playing too low (close to the edge) secures insufficient territory and influence, yet playing too high (far from the edge) allows the opponent to invade.
It has been claimed that Go is the most complex game in the world due to its vast number of variations in individual games.[tpl]Citation | publisher = American Go Association | url = http://www.usgo.org/resources/topten.html | title = Top Ten Reasons to Play Go | accessdate = 2008-06-11[/tpl] Its large board and lack of restrictions allow great scope in strategy and expression of players' individuality. Decisions in one part of the board may be influenced by an apparently unrelated situation in a distant part of the board. Plays made early in the game can shape the nature of conflict a hundred moves later.
The game complexity of Go is such that describing even elementary strategy fills many introductory books. In fact, numerical estimates show that the number of possible games of Go far exceeds the number of atoms in the observable universe.The number of board positions is at most 3361 (about 10172) since each position can be white, black, or vacant. Ignoring (illegal) suicide moves, there are at least 361! games (about 10768) since every permutation of the board positions corresponds to a game. See Go and mathematics for more details, which includes much larger estimates.

===Software players===

Go poses a daunting challenge to computer programmers.[tpl]Citation | url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/65658/sterngraepelmackay04.pdf | title=Modelling Uncertainty in the Game of Go | last=Stern | first=David | work=University of Cambridge| date=2008-02-01 | accessdate = 2008-12-04 [/tpl] The strongest computer chess programs defeat the best human players (for example, the Deep Fritz program, running on a laptop, beat reigning world champion Vladimir Kramnik without losing a single game in 2006).

As an illustration, the greatest handicap normally given to a weaker opponent is 9 stones. It was not until August 2008 that a computer won a game against a professional level player at this handicap. It was the Mogo program, which scored this first victory in an exhibition game played during the US Go Congress.[tpl]cite web | title= Supercomputer with innovative software beats Go Professional| url=http://www.cs.unimaas.nl/g.chaslot/muyungwan-mogo/ | accessdate = 2008-12-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title= AGA News: Kim Prevails Again In Man Vs Machine Rematch | url=http://www.usgo.org/news/ | accessdate = 2009-08-08[/tpl]

===Software assistance===

An abundance of software is available to support players of the game. This includes programs that can be used to view or edit game records and diagrams, programs that allow the user to search for patterns in the games of strong players, and programs that allow users to play against each other over the Internet.
Some web serversPeepo.com provide graphical aids like maps, to aid learning during play. These graphical aids may suggest possible next moves, indicate areas of influence, highlight vital stones under attack and mark stones in atari or about to be captured.
There are several file formats used to store game records, the most popular of which is SGF, short for Smart Game Format. Programs used for editing game records allow the user to record not only the moves, but also variations, commentary and further information on the game.Lists of such programs may be found at Sensei's Library or GoBase.
Electronic databases can be used to study life and death situations, joseki, fuseki and games by a particular player. Programs are available that give players pattern searching options, which allow players to research positions by searching for high-level games in which similar situations occur. Such software generally lists common follow-up moves that have been played by professionals and gives statistics on win/loss ratio in opening situations.
Internet-based Go servers allow access to competition with players all over the world, for real-time and turn-based games.Lists of Go servers are kept at Sensei's Library and the AGA website Such servers also allow easy access to professional teaching, with both teaching games and interactive game review being possible.The British Go Association provides a list of teaching services

===Literature=== 
Apart from technical literature and study material, Go and its strategies have been the subject of several works of fiction, such as The Master of Go by Nobel prize-winning author Yasunari KawabataA list of books can be found at Sensei's Library and The Girl Who Played Go by Shan Sa. 
Other books have used Go as a theme or minor plot device. For example, the novel Shibumi by Trevanian centers around the game and uses Go metaphors,[tpl]Citation | title = Go in Western Literature | chapter = Shibumi | last = McDonald | first = Brian | origyear = 1995 | year = 2002 | url = http://www.usgo.org/resources/downloads/go_in_literature.pdf |format=PDF| publisher = American Go Association | pages = 5–6 | editor = Shotwell, Peter | accessdate = 2008-06-16|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060921171349/http://www.usgo.org/resources/downloads/go_in_literature.pdf|archivedate=2006-09-21[/tpl] and The Way of Go: 8 Ancient Strategy Secrets for Success in Business and Life by Troy Anderson applies Go strategy to business.[tpl]Citation | title = The Way of Go: 8 Ancient Strategy Secrets for Success in Business and Life | last = Anderson | first = Troy | date=August 3, 2004[/tpl] GO: An Asian Paradigm for Business Strategy[tpl]Citation | last = Yasuyuki | first = Miura | title = Go, an Asian Paradigm for Business Strategy | year = 1998 | publisher = Kiseido Publishing Company | isbn = 4-906574-99-8 [/tpl] by Miura Yasuyuki, a manager with Japan Airlines,[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/igo_e/033.htm | title = The Magic of Go – 33.

Go, referred to as Weiqi, features prominently in the Eric Van Lustbader novel Jian. It is also a prominent feature of the book PopCo by Scarlett Thomas.
In the fantasy book series the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan Go is played by many of the main characters. Go is called "Stones" and is considered the most popular board game in the book's world. Jordan uses Stones to show military prowess in a character. A majority of the top players in the world are military leaders or high ranking noblemen. It has been played continuously since at least the Age of Legends, when it was known as no’ri (The Path of Daggers, Deceptive Appearances).

===Television===

The game makes multiple appearances in the television show Da Vinci's Demons; it made its début in the third episode of season one, titled "The Prisoner". 
In the second season of Star Trek: Enterprise, Trip Tucker plays a game of Go with the Cogenitor. When the Cogenitor wins, Trip comments that nobody else had beaten him in two years.
The Go proverb, "Strange things happen at the One Two point," is used as the episode title of a season two episode of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. Cameron is told by Xander that he doesn't play chess, but rather plays Go, and he offers to teach her how to play. Later, Cameron explains to Sarah that the proverb means that the "usual rules don't always apply."
Of particular note is the manga (Japanese comic book) and anime series Hikaru no Go, released in Japan in 1998, which had a large impact in popularizing Go among young players, both in Japan and—as translations were released—abroad.[tpl]Citation | first=Yoko | last=Shimatsuka | title=Do Not Pass Go | url = http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,132162,00.html| publisher =Asiaweek | accessdate = 2007-03-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070610073841/http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,132162,00.html |archivedate = 2007-06-10[/tpl][tpl]cite news | first=Charles | last=Scanlon | coauthors= | title=Young Japanese go for Go | date=2002-08-01 | publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2164532.stm | work =World News | pages = | accessdate = 2009-05-21 | language = [/tpl]

In the supernatural television series, Teen Wolf, Go has a pivotal point in the second half of the third season, being referenced multiple times throughout. Stiles Stilinski, while in a trance within his mind, plays Go with the Nogitsune on top of the Nemeton in "De-Void", the 22nd episode of the season. The board game is referred to later on in the season by Kira and her parents, who are also knowledgeable about the game.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

Similarly, Go has been used as a subject or plot device in film, such as π, A Beautiful Mind, Tron: Legacy, and The Go Master, a biopic of Go professional Go Seigen.[tpl]Citation | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03EFDC1131F937A25750C0A9619C8B63&scp=1&sq=%22The+Go+Master%22&st=nyt | title=A Prodigy's Life Is Played Out In a Japanese Game of Skill |work=The New York Times |last=Scott |first=A.O. |date=2007-03-14 | accessdate = 2008-06-16[/tpl]A list of films can de found at the EGF Internet Go Filmography 
In King Hu's wuxia film The Valiant Ones, the characters are color-coded as Go pieces (black or other dark shades for the Chinese, white for the Japanese invaders), Go boards and stones are used by the characters to keep track of soldiers prior to battle, and the battles themselves are structured like a game of Go.[tpl]Citation |author= Ng Ho |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Teo |series=Hong Kong International Film Festival |title=Transcending the Times:King Hu & Eileen Chan |publisher=Provisional Urban Council of Hong Kong |year=1998 |location=Hong Kong |page=45 |chapter=King Hu and the Aesthetics of Space[/tpl] 
In the film Pi, mathematician and number theorist Maximillian "Max" Cohen periodically plays Go with his mentor, Sol Robeson.[tpl]citation | title = The Game of Go | url = http://www.pithemovie.com/go.html | publisher = PiTheMovie.com | accessdate = 2008-07-12[/tpl] The characters each use the game as a model for their view of the universe; Sol says that the game is a microcosm of an extremely complex and chaotic world, while Max asserts that patterns can be found in the complexity of its variations.SOL: Listen to me. The Ancient Japanese considered the Go board to be a microcosm of the universe. Although when it is empty it appears to be simple and ordered, in fact, the possibilities of game play are endless. They say that no two Go games have ever been alike. Just like snowflakes. So, the Go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe. That is the truth of our world, Max. It can't be easily summed up with math. There is no simple pattern. MAX: But as a Go game progresses, the possibilities become smaller and smaller. The board does take on order. Soon, all moves are predictable. SOL: So? MAX: So, maybe, even though we're not sophisticated enough to be aware of it, there is an underlying order... a pattern, beneath every Go game. Maybe that pattern is like the pattern in the market, in the Torah. The two sixteen number. Actors Sean Gullette and Mark Margolis both spent many hours learning the game at the Brooklyn Go Club, and had the help of a Go consultant, Don Weiner (misspelled as Dan), for the film.

===Pop Culture===

The corporation and brand Atari was named after the Go term.
The Pop art artist Arman was a dan Go player. But he stopped when he realized that Go had gained the upper hand over his art. He said in the French book Arman, un entretien d'artiste[tpl]cite book|title=Arman, un entretien d'artiste| year=2004| isbn=978-2296068322|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=rUF0njqIfMYC&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=arman+joueur+de+go+artiste&source=bl&ots=kzSbbFvZKK&sig=yyBkmbCkCorTzy9b35EpTiZj6F8&hl=fr&sa=X&ei=qoiuUZDaIMiLhQeu1YHwAw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=arman%20joueur%20de%20go%20artiste&f=false|page=35[/tpl] that the picture of him published in the Go newspaper was more important for him than his exhibition at the Seibu Museum.

===Psychology===

A 2004 review of literature by Fernand Gobet, de Voogt & Retschitzki[tpl]citation | last1= Gobet | first1 = F | last2 = de Voogt | first2 = A. J | last3 = Retschitzki | first3 = J |year = 2004 | title = Moves in Mind: The Psychology of Board Games | publisher = Hove, UK: Psychology Press | isbn = 1-84169-336-7 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=fR7xZlGnyl0C&printsec=frontcover[/tpl] shows that relatively little scientific research has been carried out on the psychology of Go, compared with other traditional board games such as chess and Mancala. Computer Go research has shown that given the large search tree, knowledge and pattern recognition are more important in Go than in other strategy games, such as chess. A study of the effects of age on Go-playing[tpl]Citation | last = Masunaga | first = H | last2 = Horn | first2 =J. |year = 2001 | journal = Psychology and Aging | issue = 16 | pages = 293–311 | title = Expertise and age-related changes in components of intelligence | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.16.2.293 | volume = 16[/tpl] has shown that mental decline is milder with strong players than with weaker players. According to the review of Gobet and colleagues, the pattern of brain activity observed with techniques such as PET and fMRI does not show large differences between Go and chess. On the other hand, a study by Xiangchuan Chen et al.[tpl]citation | author = Chen | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6SYV-46YJ540-4&_user=10&_coverDate=03%2F31%2F2003&_alid=753089725&_rdoc=7&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_cdi=4844&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_ct=7&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=ccc4701dd97062447dcc4f5459b174dc | journal = Science Direct – Cognitive Brain Research | title = A functional MRI study of high-level cognition II.

===Comparisons===

Go begins with an empty board. It is focused on building from the ground up (nothing to something) with multiple, simultaneous battles leading to a point-based win. Chess is tactical rather than strategic, as the predetermined strategy is to kill one individual piece (the king). This comparison has also been applied to military and political history, with Scott Boorman's 1969 book The Protracted Game exploring the strategy of the Communist Party of China in the Chinese Civil War through the lens of Go.[tpl]Citation |last=Boorman |first=Scott A. |title=The Protracted Game: A Wei Ch'i Interpretation of Maoist Revolutionary Strategy |year=1969 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn = 0195004906 [/tpl]
A similar comparison has been drawn among Go, chess and backgammon, perhaps the three oldest games that enjoy worldwide popularity.[tpl]citation | last = Pinckard | first = William  | title = Go and the Three Games | publisher = Kiseido Publications | url = http://www.kiseido.com/three.htm | accessdate = 2008-06-11[/tpl] in Bozulich 2001 Backgammon is a "man vs. fate" contest, with chance playing a strong role in determining the outcome. Chess, with rows of soldiers marching forward to capture each other, embodies the conflict of "man vs. man". Because the handicap system tells Go players where they stand relative to other players, an honestly ranked player can expect to lose about half of their games; therefore, Go can be seen as embodying the quest for self-improvement, "man vs. self".
