USS ''Jack Miller'' (DE-410) was a John C. Butler-class destroyer escort acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War II. The primary purpose of the destroyer escort was to escort and protect ships in convoy, in addition to other tasks as assigned, such as patrol or radar picket. Post-war, she returned home proudly with two battle stars to her credit.
She was named in honor of First Lieutenant Jack Miller, who was awarded the Navy Cross for his brave actions during the Guadalcanal campaign. She was launched 10 January 1944, by Brown Shipbuilding Co., Houston, Texas; sponsored by Mrs. Henry S. Miller, mother of Lt. Miller; and commissioned 13 April 1944, Lt. Comdr. J. W. Whaley in command.

==History==

===World War II===

After shakedown along the U.S. East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico, Jack Miller sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, 13 June 1944, arriving Pearl Harbor 12 July via the Panama Canal Zone and San Diego, California. After more intensive training out of Pearl Harbor, she departed 24 July screening a convoy to Eniwetok, where she arrived 2 August. The remainder of the month was spent on patrol and convoy duty. Jack Miller sailed from Eniwetok 2 September and, after escorting a convoy to Saipan, took up harbor patrol duty there. Antisubmarine patrols, convoy screening, and escort duty kept Jack Miller busy for the next 9 months. During this period she sank five mines. In late 1944 the Jack Miller came under the command of Navy Lt. Commander Vermont C. Royster; he had served as the White House correspondent of The Wall Street Journal before the war. After the war ended, Lt. Commander Royster would leave the Navy and resume his journalism career at the Wall Street Journal; he would eventually become the paper's editor-in-chief in 1958.
In June and July, Jack Miller screened fueling groups in support of the Okinawa operation. After the war, she operated out of Japan before returning to San Diego 5 November 1945.

===Decommissioning===

Jack Miller remained at San Diego until decommissioning there 1 June 1946, and joining the Stockton Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. On 30 June 1968 she was struck from the Navy list, and, in July 1969, she was sold for scrapping.
