==Personal life==

David was born in Chicago and grew up in Park Forest, Illinois, where his father worked for the United States Postal Service and Chicago Public Schools. His interest in the history of the railroad system was sparked at a young age but extended throughout his life.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] He has written several songs discussing both his personal remembrances and history of mid-20th century railroad lines.
David claims that, when he was younger, he was abducted by Corinian aliens (from the Corendor system), who took skin and blood samples from him. He insists that aliens look like humans as opposed to the notion in pop culture that they're little green men. His most notable song, "Salame", refers to the salutation of the Corinian race. David has attended a weekly UFO meeting in Costa Mesa, California.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
He is vocal about his abstinence from smoking, alcohol, drugs and his dislike of rap musicâ€”but other parts of his life, especially since his arrival in Hollywood in 1976, are less clear. In interviews he revealed that he served as a cook in the U.S. Navy at one point in his life. Hart divorced his wife, Brigitte Unger, in 1993. In his song "Dicksboro", he revealed that he lives at the Dicksboro Apartments in Los Angeles, where Dr. Steve Brule from Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! and Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule is also said to live.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
