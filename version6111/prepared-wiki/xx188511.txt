Keen Communications, LLC., is a book publishing and packaging company created in 2007 through the merger of Menasha Ridge Press in Birmingham, Alabama, and Clerisy Press in Cincinnati, Ohio. The company publishes informational guides in the areas of outdoor recreation, travel, sports, health and fitness, nature, and business, intended for consumers, retailers, and manufacturers in these areas. Keen Communications is home to three book imprints.

==Menasha Ridge Press==

Menasha Ridge Press—located in Birmingham, Alabama—is a book publisher and packager for the outdoor recreation and travel industries. Founded by Bob Sehlinger in 1982, Menasha Ridge is an independent book publisher covering the outdoor recreation, wildlife, cooking, history, adventure, dining, and travel worldwide. Artists whose work has been published by Menasha Ridge are Colin Angus, Richard Bangs, Tao Berman, Jon Bowermaster, M. J.

Menasha Ridge also packages "Unofficial Guides" series for Wiley Publishing.

==Clerisy Press==

Clerisy Press—located in Cincinnati, Ohio—is a book publisher in the areas of sports, sports medicine, health, fitness, nutrition, business, and travel. It was founded in 2006 by Richard Hunt. Clerisy’s first book published was Crosley, by Rusty McClure, Michael A. Banks, and David Stern.
Other Clerisy Press authors include former Olympic marathoner Julie Isphording and founder of the Eureka! Ranch Doug Hall.

==Wilderness Press==

Keen Communications acquired Wilderness Press in April 2008.  When Tom Winnett published Sierra North in 1967, no other trail guide like it existed for the backcountry: detailed, mile-by-mile descriptions written by authors who walked every mile of trail.  Thus heralded the beginning of Wilderness Press, based in Berkeley, CA. Since then, Wilderness Press has expanded its boundaries to cover all of California, Alaska, Hawaii, the Pacific Northwest and Southwest, New England, Canada, and surprisingly, some of the major US cities.
