 where [tpl]math|'''∂Σ'''(''t'')[/tpl] is the moving closed path bounding the moving surface [tpl]math|'''Σ'''(''t'')[/tpl], and [tpl]math|d'''A'''[/tpl] is an element of surface area of [tpl]math|'''Σ'''(''t'')[/tpl]. The first integral calculates the work done moving a charge a distance [tpl]math|d'''ℓ'''[/tpl] based upon the [[Lorentz force]] law. In the case where the bounding surface is stationary, the [[Kelvin-Stokes theorem|Kelvin–Stokes theorem]] can be used to show this equation is equivalent to the Maxwell–Faraday equation.
[/ref] into a differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions. This form is covered as one of Maxwell's equations below.

===Maxwell's correction to Ampère's Law: The magnetic field due to a changing electric field===

Similar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is known as Maxwell's correction to Ampère's law. Maxwell's correction to Ampère's Law bootstrap together with Faraday's law of induction to form electromagnetic waves, such as light. Thus, a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field again.
Maxwell's correction to Ampère law is applied as an additive term to Ampere's law given above. This additive term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday's law above but with a different and positive constant out front. (The electric flux through an area is proportional to the area times the perpendicular part of the electric field.)
This full Ampère law including the correction term is known as the Maxwell–Ampère equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used. The Maxwell term is critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. These, though, are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below.

===Maxwell's equations===

Like all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its sources.  (For [tpl]math|B[/tpl] the sources are currents and changing electric fields.) These two properties, along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field, make up Maxwell's Equations. Maxwell's Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of classical electrodynamics including both electricity and magnetism.
The first property is the divergence of a vector field [tpl]math|A[/tpl], [tpl]math|∇ · A[/tpl], which represents how [tpl]math|A[/tpl] 'flows' outward from a given point. As discussed above, a [tpl]math|B[/tpl]-field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of [tpl]math|B[/tpl] is zero. (Such vector fields are called solenoidal vector fields.) This property is called Gauss's law for magnetism and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or magnetic monopoles. The electric field on the other hand begins and ends at electric charges so that its divergence is non-zero and proportional to the charge density (See Gauss's law).
The second mathematical property is called the curl, such that [tpl]math|∇ × A[/tpl] represents how [tpl]math|A[/tpl] curls or 'circulates' around a given point. The result of the curl is called a 'circulation source'. The equations for the curl of [tpl]math|B[/tpl] and of [tpl]math|E[/tpl] are called the Ampère–Maxwell equation and Faraday's law respectively. They represent the differential forms of the integral equations given above.
The complete set of Maxwell's equations then are:
where [tpl]math|J[/tpl] = complete microscopic current density and [tpl]math|ρ[/tpl] is the charge density.
Technically, [tpl]math|B[/tpl] is a pseudovector (also called an axial vector) due to being defined by a vector cross product. (See diagram.)
As discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric [tpl]math|E[/tpl] field and an applied magnetic [tpl]math|B[/tpl] field by producing their own internal 'bound' charge and current distributions that contribute to [tpl]math|E[/tpl] and [tpl]math|B[/tpl] but are difficult to calculate. To circumvent this problem, [tpl]math|H[/tpl] and [tpl]math|D[/tpl] fields are used to re-factor Maxwell's equations in terms of the free current density [tpl]math|Jf[/tpl] and free charge density [tpl]math|ρf[/tpl]:
These equations are not any more general than the original equations (if the 'bound' charges and currents in the material are known). They also need to be supplemented by the relationship between [tpl]math|B[/tpl] and [tpl]math|H[/tpl] as well as that between [tpl]math|E[/tpl] and [tpl]math|D[/tpl]. On the other hand, for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell's equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents.

===Electric and magnetic fields: different aspects of the same phenomenon===

According to the special theory of relativity, the partition of the electromagnetic force into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental, but varies with the observational frame of reference: An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another (in a different frame of reference) as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces.
Formally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank-2 tensor, called the electromagnetic tensor. Changing reference frames mixes these components. This is analogous to the way that special relativity mixes space and time into spacetime, and mass, momentum and energy into four-momentum.C. Doran and A. Lasenby (2003) Geometric Algebra for Physicists, Cambridge University Press, p.233

===Magnetic vector potential===

In advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and relativity it is often easier to work with a potential formulation of electrodynamics rather than in terms of the electric and magnetic fields. In this representation, the vector potential [tpl]math|A[/tpl], and the scalar potential [tpl]math|φ[/tpl], are defined such that:
The vector potential [tpl]math|A[/tpl] may be interpreted as a generalized potential momentum per unit charge just as [tpl]math|φ[/tpl] is interpreted as a generalized potential energy per unit charge.
Maxwell's equations when expressed in terms of the potentials can be cast into a form that agrees with special relativity with little effort.[tpl]harvnb|Griffiths|1999|p=422[/tpl] In relativity [tpl]math|A[/tpl] together with [tpl]math|φ[/tpl] forms the four-potential, analogous to the four-momentum that combines the momentum and energy of a particle. Using the four potential instead of the electromagnetic tensor has the advantage of being much simpler—and it can be easily modified to work with quantum mechanics.

===Quantum electrodynamics===

In modern physics, the electromagnetic field is understood to be not a classical field, but rather a quantum field; it is represented not as a vector of three numbers at each point, but as a vector of three quantum operators at each point. The most accurate modern description of the electromagnetic interaction (and much else) is quantum electrodynamics (QED),[ref]
For a good qualitative introduction see:
[/ref] which is incorporated into a more complete theory known as the Standard Model of particle physics.
In QED, the magnitude of the electromagnetic interactions between charged particles (and their antiparticles) is computed using perturbation theory; these rather complex formulas have a remarkable pictorial representation as Feynman diagrams in which virtual photons are exchanged.
Predictions of QED agree with experiments to an extremely high degree of accuracy: currently about 10−12 (and limited by experimental errors); for details see precision tests of QED. This makes QED one of the most accurate physical theories constructed thus far.
All equations in this article are in the classical approximation, which is less accurate than the quantum description mentioned here. However, under most everyday circumstances, the difference between the two theories is negligible.

==Important uses and examples of magnetic field==

===Earth's magnetic field===

The Earth's magnetic field is thought to be produced by convection currents in the outer liquid of Earth's core. The Dynamo theory proposes that these movements produce electric currents that, in turn, produce the magnetic field.[tpl]cite journal |last=Herbert |first=Yahreas |date=June 1954 |title=What makes the earth Wobble |journal=Popular Science |location=New York |publisher=Godfrey Hammond |page=266 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=NiEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96&dq=What+makes+the+earth+wobble&q=What%20makes%20the%20earth%20wobble[/tpl]
The presence of this field causes a compass, placed anywhere within it, to rotate so that the "north pole" of the magnet in the compass points roughly north, toward Earth's North Magnetic Pole. This is the traditional definition of the "north pole" of a magnet, although other equivalent definitions are also possible.
One confusion that arises from this definition is that, if Earth itself is considered as a magnet, the south pole of that magnet would be the one nearer the north magnetic pole, and vice-versa. The north magnetic pole is so-named not because of the polarity of the field there but because of its geographical location. The north and south poles of a permanent magnet are so-called because they are "north-seeking" and "south-seeking", respectively.[tpl]cite book|last=Serway|first=Raymond A.|title=College physics|year=2009|publisher=Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-495-38693-3|edition=8th |coauthors=Chris Vuille, Jerry S. Faughn |page=628[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.school-for-champions.com/science/magnets.htm |title=Magnets |last=Kurtus |first=Ron |year=2004 |work=School for champions: Physics topics |accessdate=17 July 2010[/tpl]
The figure is a sketch of Earth's magnetic field represented by field lines. For most locations, the magnetic field has a significant up/down component in addition to the North/South component.  (There is also an East/West component; Earth's magnetic poles do not coincide exactly with Earth's geological pole.)  The magnetic field can be visualised as a bar magnet buried deep in Earth's interior.
Earth's magnetic field is not constant—the strength of the field and the location of its poles vary. Moreover, the poles periodically reverse their orientation in a process called geomagnetic reversal. The most recent reversal occurred 780,000 years ago.

===Rotating magnetic fields===

The rotating magnetic field is a key principle in the operation of alternating-current motors. A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so as to maintain its alignment with the external field. This effect was conceptualized by Nikola Tesla, and later utilized in his, and others', early AC (alternating-current) electric motors.
A rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with 90 degrees phase difference in their AC currents. However, in practice such a system would be supplied through a three-wire arrangement with unequal currents.
This inequality would cause serious problems in standardization of the conductor size and so, to overcome it, three-phase systems are used where the three currents are equal in magnitude and have 120 degrees phase difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the three-phase system to create a rotating field, utilized in electric motors, is one of the main reasons why three-phase systems dominate the world's electrical power supply systems.
Because magnets degrade with time, synchronous motors use DC voltage fed rotor windings, which allows the excitation of the machine to be controlled and induction motors use short-circuited rotors (instead of a magnet) following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled stator. The short-circuited turns of the rotor develop eddy currents in the rotating field of the stator, and these currents in turn move the rotor by the Lorentz force.
In 1882, Nikola Tesla identified the concept of the rotating magnetic field. In 1885, Galileo Ferraris independently researched the concept. In 1888, Tesla gained [tpl]US patent|381968[/tpl] for his work. Also in 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin.

===Hall effect===

The charge carriers of a current carrying conductor placed in a transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; this results in a charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field. This is known as the Hall effect.
The Hall effect is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in materials such as semiconductors (negative electrons or positive holes).

===Magnetic circuits===

An important use of [tpl]math|H[/tpl] is in magnetic circuits where [tpl]math|1=B = μH[/tpl] inside a linear material. Here, [tpl]math|μ[/tpl] is the magnetic permeability of the material. This result is similar in form to Ohm's law [tpl]math|J [tpl]=[/tpl] σE[/tpl], where [tpl]math|J[/tpl] is the current density, [tpl]math|σ[/tpl] is the conductance and [tpl]math|E[/tpl] is the electric field. Extending this analogy, the counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm's law ([tpl]math|1=I = V⁄R[/tpl]) is:
Using this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of complicated magnetic field geometries, by using all the available techniques of circuit theory.

===Magnetic field shape descriptions===

===Magnetic dipoles===

The magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is depicted in the figure. From outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current [tpl]math|I[/tpl] and an area [tpl]math|a[/tpl]. Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of:
where the direction of [tpl]math|m[/tpl] is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right-hand rule. An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area [tpl]math|a[/tpl] has been reduced to zero and its current [tpl]math|I[/tpl] increased to infinity such that the product [tpl]math|1=m = Ia[/tpl] is finite. This model clarifies the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the Einstein-de Haas effect rotation by magnetization and its inverse, the Barnett effect or magnetization by rotation.[ref](See magnetic moment for further information.)
[/ref] Rotating the loop faster (in the same direction) increases the current and therefore the magnetic moment, for example.
It is sometimes useful to model the magnetic dipole similar to the electric dipole with two equal but opposite magnetic charges (one south the other north) separated by distance [tpl]math|d[/tpl]. This model produces an [tpl]math|H[/tpl]-field not a [tpl]math|B[/tpl]-field. Such a model is deficient, though, both in that there are no magnetic charges and in that it obscures the link between electricity and magnetism. Further, as discussed above it fails to explain the inherent connection between angular momentum and magnetism.

===Magnetic monopole (hypothetical)===

A magnetic monopole is a hypothetical particle (or class of particles) that has, as its name suggests, only one magnetic pole (either a north pole or a south pole). In other words, it would possess a "magnetic charge" analogous to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end.
Modern interest in this concept stems from particle theories, notably Grand Unified Theories and superstring theories, that predict either the existence, or the possibility, of magnetic monopoles. These theories and others have inspired extensive efforts to search for monopoles. Despite these efforts, no magnetic monopole has been observed to date.Two experiments produced candidate events that were initially interpreted as monopoles, but these are now regarded to be inconclusive. For details and references, see magnetic monopole.
In recent research, materials known as spin ices can simulate monopoles, but do not contain actual monopoles.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091015085916.htm |title='Magnetricity' Observed And Measured For First Time |publisher=Science Daily |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2010 [/tpl][tpl]citation |last=Gingras |first=M.J.P. |year=2009 |title=Observing Monopoles in a Magnetic Analog of Ice |journal=Science |volume=326 |issue=5951 |pages=375–376 |doi=10.1126/science.1181510 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/326/5951/375 [/tpl]
