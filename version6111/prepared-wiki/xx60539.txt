Stuttgart Airport (in German Flughafen Stuttgart, formerly Flughafen Stuttgart-Echterdingen) [tpl]Airport codes|STR|EDDS[/tpl] is an international airport located approximately [tpl]convert|13|km|abbr=on[/tpl] ([tpl]convert|10|km|abbr=on[/tpl] in a straight line) south of Stuttgart, Germany. It is the 6th busiest airport in Germany and the main airport of the state Baden-Württemberg with 9,720,877 passengers having passed through its doors in 2012. The airport lies on the boundary between the nearby town of Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Filderstadt and Stuttgart itself. 
It is an important hub for the Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings and global headquarters for car parking company APCOA Parking. In 2007, the Stuttgart Trade Fair – the ninth biggest exhibition centre in Germany – moved to grounds directly next to the airport.

==History==

The airport was built in 1939 to replace Böblingen airport. In 1945, the United States Air Force took over the airport until returning it to German authorities in 1948.
For the duration of the Cold War the runway and facilities were shared with the United States Army who operated helicopters, the Grumman OV-1 Mohawk and other fixed wing aircraft at Echterdingen Army Airfield on the southern portion of the facility.http://www.mil-airfields.de/de/stuttgart-echterdingen.htm The U.S. Army still maintains a small helicopter base on the southern side of the airport, which it shares with the Baden-Württemberg State Police helicopter wing. The police helicopter wing falls under the control of Stuttgart Police Department and has six modern helicopters based at Stuttgart and two in Söllingen.
The airport was expanded after World War II. The runway was extended to [tpl]convert|1800|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] in 1948, then to [tpl]convert|2250|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] in 1961 and finally to [tpl]convert|3345|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] in 1996.
The original 1938 terminal was finally replaced in 2004 and there are now four terminals with a maximum capacity of approximately 12 million passengers.
Politicians, town planners and nearby residents have been arguing for years about the construction of a second runway. However, on 25 June 2008 Minister-President Günther Oettinger announced that for the next 8–12 years no second runway will be built and that the restrictions for night operations stay in place.Flughafen bekommt keine zweite Startbahn.

After the death of former mayor Manfred Rommel in November 2013 local politicians proposed to rename the airport after him.http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.manfred-rommel-flughafen-cdu-will-stuttgarter-flughafen-umbenennen.069dd483-a821-4a65-a965-a08b90b789d3.html
