==Career==

Carol Hunstein moved from Florida to Atlanta, Georgia in 1976. Having established herself in the legal community by 1984, she ran against four men for election to the Superior Court in DeKalb County and made it into the runoff. During the three-week runoff, for the first time Hunstein began using the slogan “This time, this woman,’’ and upon election became the first female superior court judge in the county.
In November 1992, Hunstein was nominated to the Supreme Court of Georgia by Governor Zell Miller. She is the second woman in Georgia history to serve in this position. Since her nomination to the court in 1992, Hunstein has been re-elected by voters three times, most recently in November 2006.
Hunstein also serves as an adjunct professor at the Emory University School of Law.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gasupreme.us/justices_bios.php | title = The Supreme Court of Georgia: Justices' Biographies | publisher = Supreme Court of Georgia | accessdate = 2006-12-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061115090700/http://www.gasupreme.us/justices_bios.php  |archivedate = 2006-11-15[/tpl]
