Yiddish ([tpl]lang|yi|ייִדיש[/tpl] yidish or [tpl]lang|yi|אידיש[/tpl] idish, literally "Jewish") is a High German language of Ashkenazi Jews, and it is written in the Hebrew alphabet. Western Yiddish originated in their culture, which emerged in the 9th century in Central Europe. Many centuries later, Western Yiddish spread to Eastern Europe, where it expanded and evolved into Eastern Yiddish, which eventually spread to other continents. Western Yiddish arose around 1000 AD from Old High German most likely around either Speyer and Worms on the Rhine or Regensburg on the Danube. Before 1500, it separated from German.[ref]
