===2010===

In January 2010, it was reported that tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, had been discovered in a sample of ground water taken from a monitoring well the previous November.[tpl]cite web|url=http://healthvermont.gov/enviro/rad/yankee/tritium.aspx |title=Investigation into Tritium Contamination at Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station |publisher=Healthvermont.gov [/tpl]  The level of the isotope was initially below the acceptable limit for drinking water set by the Environmental Protection Agency. By mid-January, however, the level had risen to 20,000 picocuries per liter (pCi/l), the federal limit for drinking water. The head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told Vermont’s congressional delegation that the agency would devote more resources to addressing concerns about Vermont Yankee, and that he expected the source of the tritium leak would be located within the next several weeks.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20100127/NEWS02/100126024/-1/TOPICS0202/Delegation-ask-NRC-for-assurances-on-Vermont-Yankee |title=Delegation ask NRC for assurances on Vermont Yankee |work=The Burlington Free Press |date=January 27, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
On February 4, 2010, Vermont Yankee reported that ground water samples from a newly dug monitoring well at the reactor site were found to contain about 775,000 pCi of tritium per liter (more than 37 times the federal limit). On February 5, 2010, samples from an underground vault were found to contain 2.7 million pCi/l."Vermont Yankee zeroes in on possible source of leak". Burlington Free Press, February 6, 2010 [tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] On February 14, 2010, the source of the leak was found to be a pair of steam pipes inside the Advanced Off-Gas (AOG) pipe tunnel.  The pipes were repaired, stopping the leak.
Samples taken from the river and other drinking water sources by the Vermont Department of Health showed no detectable levels of tritium.laboratory_testing. Healthvermont.gov. Retrieved on 2014-04-12. The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services made a similar statement after several tests of the river.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/dphs/lab/documents/spring2010.pdf |title=Final 6-4-10.pub |format=PDF [/tpl]
During the search for the source of the tritium leak, other radionuclides were found in the soil at the site. Levels of cesium-137 were found to be three to ten times higher than background levels. Silt in a pipe tunnel contained 2,600 picocuries/kg, but contamination outside the pipe tunnel was limited to a small volume, about [tpl]convert|150|ft3[/tpl] of soil. According to the Vermont State Department of Health, there was no health risk from the cesium, as the quantities were small and it had not migrated.
Since cesium-137 is a fission product, it is an indicator of a nuclear fuel leak, but the consensus was that the cesium-137 probably leaked from defective fuel assemblies during or prior to 2001, when the last leak of that type was reported by Vermont Yankee. (Problems with fuel rods were common in the 1970s and 1980s.)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/20100403/NEWS02/4030365/1003/NEWS02 |title="Plant tests pointing to failed fuel rods," Rutland Herald, April 5, 2010 |publisher=Rutlandherald.com [/tpl]
In early November, 2010, a water leak caused by a faulty weld caused a "conservative" four-day shutdown while the pipe involved was repaired. A company spokesman said that "if plant managers had known on Sunday night what they knew on Monday, they might have tried to fix the leak while the plant kept running."Wald, Matthew L., "Vermont Yankee Reactor Restarts" The New York Times Green blog, November 11, 2010. Retrieved 2010-11-11.
In 2010, Vermont Electric Power Company constructed a new substation, designated as the Vernon Substation, on the Vermont Yankee site to serve as the site's new main transmission facility and to connect a new 345 kV transmission line to Central Vermont as part of its Southern Loop project. The aging Entergy-owned Vermont Yankee substation could not handle the additional line or any additional transformers and VELCO desired to have a utility owned and controlled substation for what is probably the state's most important interconnection point. Additionally, the local 115 kV system was relying exclusively on Entergy's single 345 kV to 115 kV transformer. The construction of the Vernon substation included a second 345 kV to 115 kV transformer to supplement the existing Entergy owned transformer. The additional transformer also provided redundancy for Vermont Yankee's source of offsite power. The four transmission lines that formerly connected directly to the Vermont Yankee substation now connect to the Vernon substation, and three tie-lines, one at 115 kV and two at 345 kV, connect the Vermont Yankee substation to the Vernon substation. Each 345 kV tie line is capable of carrying the full power output of the plant.

===2011===

During the week of January 17, 2011, tritium was detected at a level of 9,200 picocuries per liter (below the federally required reporting level) in an area 150–200 feet north of the location where it was detected a year earlier.  According to the State's radiological health chief at the Vermont Health Department, Bill Irwin, and Vermont Yankee spokesman, Larry Smith, the source of the leak is not yet known.  Irwin and Governor Peter Shumlin expressed concern about the discovery.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.vpr.net/news_detail/89815/ |title=Radioactive Tritium Found In New Well At Vermont Yankee|publisher=Vermont Public Radio|date=January 21, 2011|accessdate=March 16, 2011[/tpl]

===2012===

On January 19, 2012, Judge J. Garvan Murtha of United States District Court in Brattleboro ruled that the state of Vermont could not force Vermont Yankee to close down, as the legislation that attempted to do so was based on radiological safety arguments that are the exclusive concern of the NRC. The judge also held that the state cannot force the plant’s owner, Entergy, to sell electricity from the reactor to in-state utilities at reduced rates as a condition of continued operation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/science/earth/vermont-cant-shut-down-nuclear-plant-judge-rules.html |title=Judge Rules Vermont Can’t Shut Nuclear Plant |publisher=New York Times|date=January 19, 2012|accessdate=January 24, 2013|first=Matthew L.|last=Wald[/tpl]

===2013===

On June 7, 2013, Vermont's Public Service Board issued Entergy a Certificate of Public Good to install an outdoor diesel generator to replace a tie line from the nearby hydroelectric station as its station blackout power source. The outdoor generator would only operate if the plant's main emergency diesel generators located inside the turbine building were to fail. The outdoor generator is a self-contained unit that does not require cooling water from the plant's cooling water systems. The new generator would power instrumentation in the control room and would be capable of providing emergency AC power to one train of each of the plant's emergency cooling systems.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reformer.com/latestnews/ci_23411941/psb-approves-generator-at-vermont-yankee |title=PSB approves generator at Vermont Yankee |publisher=Brattleboro Reformer|date=June 7, 2013|accessdate=July 1, 2013[/tpl]  On August 27, 2013, Entergy announced in a press release that it would close Vermont Yankee by the end of 2014.  Among the reasons cited for the closure were ongoing low energy prices resulting from increased shale gas production, and the high operating costs of the plant.[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.entergy.com/News_Room/newsrelease.aspx?NR_ID=2769 |title=Entergy to Close, Decommission Vermont Yankee |date=August 27, 2013|accessdate=August 27, 2013[/tpl]

==Protests and politics==

Esther Poneck led the New England Coalition on Nuclear Pollution in opposing construction of Vermont Yankee in 1971. In the 1970s and 1980s there were many anti-nuclear protests at Vermont Yankee which attempted to block access to the plant.David C. Brody, James R. Acker, Wayne A. Logan (2001). Criminal law Jones & Bartlett Publishers, p. 276. More recent protests include:
In February 2010, the Vermont Senate voted 26 to 4 against allowing the PSB to consider re-certifying the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Plant after 2012, citing radioactive tritium leaks, misstatements in testimony by plant officials, a cooling tower collapse in 2007, and other problems.Wald, Matthew L., Vermont Senate Votes to Close Nuclear Plant The New York Times, February 24, 2010. Some businesses in Vermont were concerned there was an absence of a clear plan to replace the electricity generated by the plant. A spokesman for IBM, the largest private employer in the state, and the state's largest consumer of electricity, said "we have to be smarter than this".Entergy Makes Last Ditch Effort To Save Vermont Yankee WPTZ.com, February 22, 2010. Larry Reilly, president of Central Vermont Public Service Corp., Vermont's largest utility, stated in 2011 that he was untroubled by the prospect of closure: "There's plenty of power out there"."M. D. Drysdale, "New Leadership for Vt.'s Biggest Utility: CVPS's Reilly Not Worried About Vermont Yankee," The Herald of Randolph, April 21, 2011.  Analysis by researchers at the University of Vermont estimated that an increase of "slightly more than 3 percent" in the retail price of electricity in Vermont would result from closing Vermont Yankee.
Governor Peter Shumlin is a prominent opponent of the Vermont Yankee. Two days after Shumlin was elected governor in November 2010, Entergy sought offers to purchase the plant.Wald, Matthew L., Vermont Nuclear Plant Up for Sale The New York Times, November 4, 2010.
