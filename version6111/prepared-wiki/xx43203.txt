The Iraqi Republican Guard ([tpl]lang-ar|حرس العراقي الجمهوري[/tpl] ""Ḥaris al-‘Irāq al-Jamhūriyy") was a branch of the Iraqi military from 1969 to 2003, primarily during the presidency of Saddam Hussein. It later became the Republican Guard Corps, and then the Republican Guard Forces Command (RGFC) with its expansion into two corps. The Republican Guard was disbanded in 2003, after the invasion of Iraq by a U.S.-led international coalition.
The Republican Guard were the elite troops of the Iraqi army directly reporting to Saddam Hussein, unlike the paramilitary force Fedayeen Saddam, and the ordinary Iraqi Army. They were easily recognizable by their red or Maroon berets, rather than the ordinary black of the Iraqi Army. Guard members were mainly, but not exclusively, Sunni Arabs rather than Shi'a Arabs, or Sunni Kurds. They were better trained, disciplined, equipped, and paid than ordinary Iraqi soldiers, receiving bonuses, new cars, and subsidized housing.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/02/military_fact_files/v3_special_forces/html/pay.stm |title=US Marines and the Republican Guard: Pay |work=BBC News[/tpl]

==History==

Formed in 1969, it was originally created to be a Presidential Guard. Its primary objective was to maintain the stability of the regime and provide protection against internal and external enemies. During the Iran-Iraq War, it was expanded into a large military force. It was disbanded along with the rest of Iraqi military after the U.S.-U.K. invasion of Iraq in 2003 by the Coalition Provisional Authority of the occupying U.S. and U.K. forces.
The force's last commander was Qusay Hussein, the younger son of Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein was so confident about the capability of the guard that he had said: "In history when they write about Napoleon's Guard, they will arrange them next to the Republican Guard of Iraq."[tpl]cite book |title=The Iraqi Perspective Report |last=Woods |first=Kevin |coauthors=Michael R.

==Iran-Iraq War==

Initially, the Guard had limited capabilities; however, during the Iran-Iraq War, it was expanded to five brigades. By 1986 the war had exhausted Iraq with both Iran and Iraq suffering heavy casualties. Iran had by then captured Al Faw and generally pushed Iraqi forces back to the prewar borders. This caused the Iraqi Ba'ath Party to convene the Ba'ath Extraordinary Congress of July 1986. During this Congress the Ba'ath Party decided on a new strategy to overhaul the Iraqi military and utilize Iraq's manpower capability. The government closed all colleges and universities and began a mass mobilization program to force draft dodgers into the Iraqi Popular Army. This decision allowed for the drafting of thousands of university students, who were sent to military summer camps. In addition, the military began accepting Sunni volunteers from throughout Iraq.
With this massive influx of manpower the Republican Guard expanded to over 25 brigades which were led by loyal officers drawn from the Iraqi military. This force then conducted the Ramadan Mubarak operation which recaptured the Al Faw and stabilized the front and later pushed the Iranians back.
(Note: "Ramadan Mubarak" means "Blessed Ramadan";  the operation was so named because it began on the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.)

==Persian Gulf War==

See articles Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm
Between the invasion of Kuwait and the Persian Gulf War, the number of Republican Guard formations was expanded and the Guard was reorganized. The Republican Guard Forces Command was also created during this period. At the beginning of the Persian Gulf War, it consisted of the following units:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ada484530 |title=Iraqi Perspectives Project Phase II Um Al-Ma’arik (The Mother of All Battles): Operational and Strategic Insights from an Iraqi Perspective |work=Institute for Defense Analyses |date=May 2008 |page=272[/tpl]
Deployed outside of the corps structure were various other units including:
The Republican Guard also included two Corps Headquarters, the Allah Akbar Republican Guard Operations Command, and the Fat'h al-Mubayyin Republican Guard Operations Command, separate artillery detachments and numerous field support units.
Between the invasion of Kuwait and the start of the war on January 17, 1991, four more RGFC internal security divisions had been formed which remained behind in Iraq. All of these units were motorized infantry. The names of only three of them were identified: the Al-Abed, Al-Mustafa ('The Elect') and Al-Nida Divisions ('The Call'). They may have conducted operations against Kurdish forces in the north.

===Invasion of Kuwait===

By 1 August 1990, there were more than 100,000 Iraqi troops with up to 700 tanks on the Kuwaiti border.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/2/newsid_2526000/2526937.stm |title=1990: Iraq invades Kuwait |work=BBC News[/tpl]
On 2 August 1990, the Republican Guard units commenced the invasion of Kuwait, which lasted two days.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ada484530 |title=Iraqi Perspectives Project Phase II Um Al-Ma’arik (The Mother of All Battles): Operational and Strategic Insights from an Iraqi Perspective |work=Institute for Defense Analyses |date=May 2008 |page=123[/tpl]  The Kuwait army strength was 16,000,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ada484530 |title=Iraqi Perspectives Project Phase II Um Al-Ma’arik (The Mother of All Battles): Operational and Strategic Insights from an Iraqi Perspective |work=Institute for Defense Analyses |date=May 2008 |page=118[/tpl] so on paper Iraqi forces outnumbered the Kuwaitis 7 to 1. However, the actual ratio was far worse; the initial attack was so quick,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ada484530 |title=Iraqi Perspectives Project Phase II Um Al-Ma’arik (The Mother of All Battles): Operational and Strategic Insights from an Iraqi Perspective |work=Institute for Defense Analyses |date=May 2008 |pages=90-95[/tpl] and the Kuwaiti units so unprepared, that many of Kuwait's armed forces were on leave and unable to report in time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.military.com/Content/MoreContent?file=hart01 |title=The Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait: An Eyewitness Account |work=Military.com |pages=3-4[/tpl]
The attack was conducted by eight RGFC divisions (two armoured, two mechanized, three motorised infantry and one special forces). The main thrust was conducted from the north down the main Iraq-Kuwait road, later famous as the Highway of Death, by the Hammurabi Armoured Division, with the Nebuchadnezzar Infantry division following; the Tawakalna Mechanised and Al Faw Infantry Divisions advanced on the flanks.  The supporting attack from the west was led by the Medina Armoured Division, followed by the Adnan Infantry Division and the Baghdad Mechanised Division.  Commandos deployed by helicopters joined the attack on Kuwait City.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ada484530 |title=Iraqi Perspectives Project Phase II Um Al-Ma’arik (The Mother of All Battles): Operational and Strategic Insights from an Iraqi Perspective |work=Institute for Defense Analyses |date=May 2008 |pages=92-95[/tpl]
After the invasion, the Republican Guard was withdrawn and redeployed into strategic reserve positions in northern Kuwait and southern and central Iraq.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ada484530 |title=Iraqi Perspectives Project Phase II Um Al-Ma’arik (The Mother of All Battles): Operational and Strategic Insights from an Iraqi Perspective |work=Institute for Defense Analyses |date=May 2008 |page=169[/tpl]

===Desert Storm===

During the Persian Gulf War, the U.S. VII Corps assembled in full strength and launched an armoured attack into Iraq early Sunday, February 24, just to the west of Kuwait, taking Iraqi forces by surprise. Simultaneously, the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps launched a sweeping “left-hook” attack across the largely undefended desert of southern Iraq, led by the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized). Once the allies had penetrated deep into Iraqi territory, they turned eastward, launching a flank attack against the Republican Guard.
Both sides exchanged fire, but the Republican guard divisions, worn down by weeks of aerial bombardment, proved unable to withstand the Allied advance. Tank battles, including the Battle of Medina Ridge and the Battle of 73 Easting, flared as the Republican Guard attempted to retreat. The Allies won with minimal losses while inflicting heavy losses on the Iraqi Army.

==Between the Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq War==

All the eight Republican Guard divisions were involved in fighting during the Gulf War and the "Tawakalna" Division was disbanded due to losses. The remaining formations led the suppression of the 1991 uprisings in northern and southern Iraq - the Kurdish insurgency in the north and the Shi'ite uprising in the east. During these times, there were numerous accusations of the use of poison gas, rape and torture. The Hammurabi and Medina divisions surrounded Karbala with Tanks and artillery and shelled the city for one week killing thousands and destroying entire neighborhoods.
Though it was reduced to a strength of seven or eight divisions, the RGFC was reconstituted, taking equipment from Army heavy divisions.

==2003 Iraq War==

See article: Iraq War
It was subordinate to the "Special Security Apparatus of the State" and not to the Ministry of Defense (Iraq) as was the regular Iraqi army. It was split into two Corps, one for the defense and control of northern Iraq, called "Allah Akbar Operations Command", composed of infantry and armoured units. And the "Fat'h al-Mubayyin Operations Command" composed primarily of  mechanized units, which was located in the southern part of the country. In 2002, it was reported that the Republican Guard and the Fedayeen Saddam were both training in urban warfare and in guerrilla warfare. It is believed by some that some of the former Republican Guard forces loyal to Saddam Hussein are still fighting on the ground as guerrilla insurgents after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
The Republican Guard then consisted of between 50,000 and 60,000 men (although some sources indicate up to 80,000), all volunteers, and some 750 Soviet T-72 and Asad Babil tanks and scores of T-55 and T-62 tanks, along with other mechanized vehicles. A further 90-100 T-72 tanks were operated by the Special Republican Guard. These forces were intentionally away from the capital to avert a possible rebellion against the regime. The members of this body of the army were better paid, equipped, armed and trained. They formed a special corps that were given the ability to buy houses and given other privileges to ensure loyalty to the regime.
In the Second Gulf War, before U.S. troops had entered Baghdad and according to information, the CIA agents infiltrated through the initiative of volunteers. They came into contact with members of the first and second ladder of command of the Republican Guard to ensure an influx of American troops in Baghdad without problems. In that pact, allegedly signed by Donald Rumsfeld, included transportation insurance for themselves and their families outside Iraq, large sums of money, the promise of official positions in Iraq post-invasion for those who had not committed war crimes, including U.S. residency and citizenship for some key leaders. Of course, the soldiers were unaware that their superiors had agreed the surrender of Baghdad and even less the Fedayeen, which were abandoned to their fate once the armed conflict officially ended.More information on the case of the surrender of Baghdad text published by Walid Rabbah in English and in Spanish papers.

===2003 Order of Battle===

On April 2, 2003,  U.S. Army Brigadier General Vincent Brooks stated that the Baghdad division of the Iraqi Republican Guard had been "destroyed". Iraq information minister Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf responded that this was another American "lie".USATODAY.com - U.S.: Baghdad division of Republican Guard destroyedCNN.com - Sahaf: U.S. troops will be burned
The RG was officially dissolved on May 23, 2003 per Order Number 2 of the Coalition Provisional Authority under Paul Bremer.Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 2: Dissolution of Entities
It is believed that some if not many members of the Republican Guard joined several of the insurgent groups currently operating in Iraq such as the Return.
