==Imprisonment and aftermath==

Popper was charged and convicted of seven acts of murder in March 1991. In prison he became religious and in June 1993 he married a Canadian-Jewish woman from a family of Kach activists. Popper and his wife were granted conjugal visits, and they had three children.
On 17 January 2007, while on a 48-hour furlough from prison, Popper was involved in a car accident he caused by crossing a solid line, hitting oncoming traffic. His wife and one of his sons were killed in the accident. Popper himself was moderately injured. Police reported that Popper's driver's license had expired in 1999,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3354022,00.html|title=Israel News|publisher=YnetNews.Com|date=January 18, 2007[/tpl] and that he was driving illegally without a license. Initial reports indicate Popper's children were not wearing seatbelts in the backseat.
Popper was initially imprisoned in Maasiyahu Prison, and was placed in the Torani cellblock, a special cellblock for religious inmates. Prisoners there pray three times a day and spend most of the day studying the Torah and other sacred texts. 
At one point, his cellmate was former minister Shlomo Benizri. After Benizri's release, Popper's influence in the Torani bloc grew, and he began harassing former President Moshe Katsav, serving a seven-year sentence for rape and other sexual offenses, due him having denied his request for a pardon while he was in office. According to the Israel Prison Service, Popper had verbally abused Katsav and sent other inmates to harass him. In October 2012, Popper was transferred to the maximum-security Ayalon Prison.http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/after-bullying-katsav-jewish-terrorist-ami-popper-moved-to-new-prison.premium-1.470211http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4292646,00.html
In February 1999 Popper's sentence was commuted from seven life terms to 40 years. Currently he is eligible for parole in 2023, after 33 years in prison.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
Right wing and Orthodox politicians in Israel have demanded his release along with other Israeli prisoners who were convicted of murder or other violence committed against Palestinians, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners who committed murder or violence against Israelis.
Popper later remarried and then divorced. In May 2013, Popper married his third wife; a woman known only as "M" who had previously gained headlines by allowing self-professed rabbi Elior Chen to severely abuse her children. The couple was married in a small ceremony in Jerusalem, after Popper was granted a prison furlough.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4381764,00.html
