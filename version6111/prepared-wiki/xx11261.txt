[/ref] "Sugar-sweetened" includes drinks that use high-fructose corn syrup, as well as those using sucrose.
Many soft drinks contain ingredients that are themselves sources of concern: caffeine is linked to anxiety and sleep disruption when consumed in excess,BBC Fizzy drinks 'affect children's sleep' 8 January 2003 and some critics question the health effects of added sugars and artificial sweeteners.The sweeter side: Benefits and risks of artificial sweeteners Sodium benzoate has been investigated by researchers at University of SheffieldMartin Hickman Caution: Some soft drinks may seriously harm your health The Independent on Sunday 27 May 2007 as a possible cause of DNA damage and hyperactivity. Other substances have negative health effects, but are present in such small quantities that they are unlikely to pose any substantial health risk provided that the beverages are consumed only in moderation.
In 1998, the Center for Science in the Public Interest published a report titled Liquid Candy: How Soft Drinks are Harming Americans' Health. The report examined statistics relating to the increase in soft drink consumption and claimed that consumption is "likely contributing to health problems." It also criticized marketing efforts by soft drink companies.Michael F Jacobson PhD, Liquid Candy: How Soft Drinks are Harming Americans' Health, (CSPI, Washington DC 1998; 2nd Ed. 2005).

===Obesity and weight-related diseases===

From 1977 to 2002, Americans doubled their consumption of sweetened beverages—a trend that was paralleled by doubling the prevalence of obesity. The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with weight and obesity, and changes in consumption can help predict changes in weight. One study followed 548 schoolchildren over 19 months and found that changes in soft drink consumption were associated with changes in body mass index (BMI). Each soft drink that a child added to his or her daily consumption was accompanied by an increase in BMI of 0.24 kg/m2. Similarly, an 8-year study of 50,000 female nurses compared women who went from drinking almost no soft drinks to drinking more than one a day to women who went from drinking more than one soft drink a day to drinking almost no soft drinks. The women who increased their consumption of soft drinks gained 8.0 kg over the course of the study while the women who decreased their consumption gained only 2.8 kg. In each of these studies, the absolute number of soft drinks consumed per day was also positively associated with weight gain.
It remains possible that the correlation is due to a third factor: people who lead unhealthy lifestyles might consume more soft drinks. If so, then the association between soft drink consumption and weight gain could reflect the consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle rather than the consequences of consuming soft drinks. Experimental evidence is needed to definitively establish the causal role of soft drink consumption. Reviews of the experimental evidence suggest that soft drink consumption does cause weight gain, but the effect is often small except for overweight individuals.
Many of these experiments examined the influence of sugar-sweetened soft drinks on weight gain in children and adolescents. In one experiment, adolescents replaced sugar-sweetened soft drinks in their diet with artificially sweetened soft drinks that were sent to their homes over 25 weeks. Compared with children in a control group, children who received the artificially sweetened drinks saw a smaller increase in their BMI (by −.14 kg/m2), but this effect was only statistically significant among the heaviest children (who saw a benefit of −.75 kg/m2). In another study, an educational program encouraged schoolchildren to consume fewer soft drinks. During the school year, the prevalence of obesity decreased among children in the program by 0.2%, compared to a 7.5% increase among children in the control group. Another study, published in Pediatrics in 2013, concluded that for children from the age of 2 to 5, their risk of obesity increased by 43% if they were regular soft drink consumers as opposed to those who rarely or never consumed them.[tpl]cite doi|10.1542/peds.2013-0570[/tpl]
Sugar-sweetened drinks have also been speculated[ref]de Rutyer, Janne C, et al. ''A Trial of Sugar-free or Sugar-Sweetened
Beverages and Body Weight in Children''. The new England Journal of Medicine, 2012, p. 1.[/ref] to cause weight gain in adults. In one study, overweight individuals consumed a daily supplement of sucrose-sweetened or artificially sweetened drinks or foods for a 10 week period. Most of the supplement was in the form of soft drinks. Individuals in the sucrose group gained 1.6 kg, and individuals in the artificial-sweetener group lost 1.0 kg. A two week study had participants supplement their diet with sugar-sweetened soft drinks, artificially sweetened soft drinks, or neither. Although the participants gained the most weight when consuming the sugar-sweetened drinks, some of the differences were unreliable: the differences between men who consumed sugar-sweetened drinks or no drinks was not statistically significant.
Other research suggests that soft drinks could play a special role in weight gain. One four-week experiment compared a 450 calorie/day supplement of sugar-sweetened soft drinks to a 450 calorie/day supplement of jelly beans. The jelly bean supplement did not lead to weight gain, but the soft drink supplement did. The likely reason for the difference in weight gain is that people who consumed the jelly beans lowered their caloric intake at subsequent meals, while people who consumed soft drinks did not. Thus, the low levels of satiety provided by sugar-sweetened soft drinks may explain their association with obesity. That is, people who consume calories in sugar-sweetened beverages may fail to adequately reduce their intake of calories from other sources. Indeed, people consume more total calories in meals and on days when they are given sugar-sweetened beverages than when they are given artificially sweetened beverages or water. However, these results are contradicted by a study by Adam Drewnowski published in 2004, in which "32 subjects consumed a 300-calorie snack of fat-free raspberry cookies or regular cola on two occasions each – either two hours ("early") or 20 minutes ("late") before lunch." It found that "...the calories eaten at lunch were not affected by whether the snack was cookies or cola."[ref]
</ref>
A study by Purdue University reported that no-calorie sweeteners were linked to an increase in body weight. The experiment compared rats who were fed saccharin-sweetened yogurt and glucose-sweetened yogurt. The saccharin group eventually consumed more calories, gained more weight and more body fat, and did not compensate later by cutting back.
The consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks can also be associated with many weight-related diseases, including diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors,[ref]
</ref> and elevated blood pressure.<ref name="Raben, Vasilaras, Moller, & Astrup (2002)"/>
According to research presented at the American Heart Association's Epidemiology and Prevention/Nutrition, Physical Activity and Metabolism 2013 Scientific Sessions by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health, sugar-sweetened beverages may be responsible for 180,000 deaths every year worldwide.180,000 deaths worldwide may be associated with sugary soft drinks

===Dental decay===

Most soft drinks contain high concentration of simple carbohydrates: glucose, fructose, sucrose and other simple sugars. Oral bacteria ferment carbohydrates and produce acid, which dissolves tooth enamel during the dental decay process; thus, sweetened drinks are likely to increase risk of dental caries. The risk is greater if the frequency of consumption is high.Marshall TA, Levy SM, Broffitt B, Warren JJ, Eichenberger-Gilmore JM, Burns TL, Stumbo PJ. "Dental caries and beverage consumption in young children" Pediatrics 2003 Sep;112(3 Pt 1) e184-91 http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/112/3/e184
A large number of soft drinks are acidic, and some may have a pH of 3.0 or even lower.[tpl]cite web | publisher = British Soft Drinks Association | title = Acids | url = http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/Default.aspx?page=409 | accessdate = 2006-09-12[/tpl] Drinking acidic drinks over a long period of time and continuous sipping can therefore erode the tooth enamel. However, under normal conditions, scientific evidence indicates Coca-Cola's acidity causes no immediate harm.Mikkelson, Barbara & Mikkelson, David P. (2004). "Acid Slip". Retrieved June 10, 2005.
Using a drinking straw is often advised by dentists as the drink does not come into as much contact with the teeth. It has also been suggested that brushing teeth right after drinking soft drinks should be avoided as this can result in additional erosion to the teeth due to the presence of acid.[tpl]Cite journal |author=M.

===Hypokalemia===

There have been a handful of published reports describing individuals with severe hypokalemia (low potassium levels) related to chronic extreme consumption (4-10 L/day) of colas.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tsimihodimos V, Kakaidi V, & Elisaf M. |title=Cola-induced hypokalaemia: pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical implications |journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=900–2 |date=June 2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2009.02051.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-1241.2009.02051.x/abstract |pmid=19490200[/tpl]free full text[tpl]subscription required[/tpl]

===Soft drinks related to bone density and bone loss===

In a meta-analysis of 88 studies, drinking soda correlates with a decrease in milk consumption along with the vitamin D, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, calcium, protein and other micronutrients.[tpl]cite web| publisher = Harvard School of Public Health | title= Sugary Drinks or Diet Drinks: What's the Best Choice? | url =http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/sugary-vs-diet-drinks/ | accessdate = 2011-10-14[/tpl] Phosphorus, a micronutrient, can be found in cola-type beverages, but there may be a risk in consuming too much. Phosphorus and calcium are used in the body to create calcium-phosphate, which is the main component of bone. However, the combination of too much phosphorus with too little calcium in the body can lead to a degeneration of bone mass.
Research suggests a statistically significant inverse relationship between consumption of carbonated beverages and bone mineral density in young girls, which places them at increased risk of suffering fractures in the future.J Bone Miner Res. 2003 Sep;18(9) 1563-9
One hypothesis to explain this relationship is that the phosphoric acid contained in some soft drinks (colas) displaces calcium from the bones, lowering bone density of the skeleton and leading to weakened bones, or osteoporosis. However, calcium metabolism studies by Dr. Robert Heaney suggested that the net effect of carbonated soft drinks, (including colas, which use phosphoric acid as the acidulent) on calcium excretion in urine was negligible. Heaney concluded that carbonated soft drinks, which do not contain the nutrients needed for bone health, may displace other foods which do, and that the real issue is that people who drink a lot of soft drinks also tend to have an overall diet that is low in calcium.[tpl]cite journal | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | author = Heaney RP, Rafferty K. | title = Carbonated beverages and urinary calcium excretion | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 343–347 | date = September 2001 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/74/3/343 | pmid = 11522558 [/tpl] In the 1950s and 1960s there were attempts in France and Japan to ban the sale of Coca-Cola as dangerous since phosphates can block calcium absorption.  However, these were unsuccessful as the amounts of phosphate were shown to be too small to have a significant effect.Phosphates, in Smith, Andrew. The Oxford companion to American food and drink. Oxford University Press US, 2007, ISBN 0-19-530796-8, p.451

===Sugar content===

The USDA's recommended daily intake (RDI) of added sugars is less than 10 teaspoons per day for a 2,000-calorie diet.Kasper, Dr. Joe, Tasty Tuesdays #13, Stay Far, Far Away, 2012 High caloric intake contributes to obesity if not balanced with exercise, with a large amount of exercise being required to offset even small but calorie-rich food and drinks.
Until 1985, most of the calories in soft drinks came from sugar or corn syrup. As of 2010, in the United States high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is used nearly exclusively as a sweetener because of its lower cost,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/289220-pure-cane-sugar-vs-high-fructose-corn-syrup/ |title=Pure Cane Sugar Vs. High Fructose Corn Syrup |publisher=livestrong.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-23[/tpl] while in Europe, sucrose dominates, because EU agricultural policies favor production of sugar beets in Europe proper and sugarcane in the former colonies over the production of corn. HFCS has been criticized[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.diabeteshealth.com/read/2008/08/20/4274/the-dangers-of-high-fructose-corn-syrup/ |title=The Dangers of High Fructose Corn Syrup |publisher=diabeteshealth.org[/tpl] as having a number of detrimental effects on human health, such as promoting diabetes, hyperactivity, hypertension, and a host of other problems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.westonaprice.org/motherlinda/cornsyrup.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110430114302/http://www.westonaprice.org/motherlinda/cornsyrup.html|archivedate=2011-04-30 |title=The Murky World of High Fructose Corn Syrup |publisher=Westonaprice.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-08[/tpl]  Although anecdotal evidence has been presented to support such claims, it is well known that the human body breaks sucrose down into glucose and fructose before it is absorbed by the intestines. Simple sugars such as fructose are converted into the same intermediates as in glucose metabolism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/depts/mcam/mcbc/lect_2004/lecture_21.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080409062950/http://www.uic.edu/depts/mcam/mcbc/lect_2004/lecture_21.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-09 |title=Pathways for the Interconversion of Sugars, University of Illinois Chicago, Medical Biochemistry 531, Lecture 21 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl]  However, metabolism of fructose is extremely rapid and is initiated by fructokinase.  Fructokinase activity is not regulated by metabolism or hormones and proceeds rapidly after intake of fructose.  While the intermediates of fructose metabolism are similar to those of glucose, the rates of formation are excessive.  This fact promotes fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis in the liver, leading to accumulation of fat throughout the body and possibly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.  Increased blood lipid levels also seem to follow fructose ingestion over time. A sugar drink or high-sugar drink may refer to any beverage consisting primarily of water and sugar (often  cane sugar or high-fructose corn syrup), including some soft drinks, some fruit juices, and energy drinks.

===Benzene===

In 2006, the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency published the results of its survey of benzene levels in soft drinks,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2006/mar/benzenesurvey |title=of benzene levels in soft drinks |publisher=Food.gov.uk |date=2006-03-31 |accessdate=2009-06-08[/tpl] which tested 150 products and found that four contained benzene levels above the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking water.
The United States Food and Drug Administration released its own test results of several soft drinks containing benzoates and ascorbic or erythorbic acid. Five tested drinks contained benzene levels above the Environmental Protection Agency's recommended standard of 5 ppb. The Environmental Working GroupEWG Issues || Toxics[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl] has uncovered additional FDA test results that showed the following results: Of 24 samples of diet soda tested between 1995 and 2001 for the presence of benzene, 19 (79%) had amounts of benzene in excess of the federal tap water standard of 5 ppb. Average benzene levels were 19 ppb, about four times tap water standard. One sample contained 55 ppb of benzene, 11 fold tap water standards. Despite these findings, as of 2006, the FDA stated its belief that "the levels of benzene found in soft drinks and other beverages to date do not pose a safety concern for consumers".US FDA/CFSAN - Questions and Answers on the Occurrence of Benzene in Soft Drinks and Other Beverages

A similar CSE report in August 2006 prompted many state governments to have issued a ban of the sale of soft drinks in schools. Kerala issued a complete ban on the sale or manufacture of soft drinks altogether. (These were later struck down in court.)

==Government regulation==

===Schools===

In recent years, debate on whether high-calorie soft drink vending machines should be allowed in schools has been on the rise. Opponents of the (soft drink) vending machines believe that soft drinks are a significant contributor to childhood obesity and tooth decay, and that allowing soft drink sales in schools encourages children to believe they are safe to consume in moderate to large quantities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12604166/ns/business-consumer_news/t/non-diet-sodas-be-pulled-schools/|title=Non-diet sodas to be pulled from schools|agency=Associated Press|date=May 5, 2006[/tpl] Opponents argue that schools have a responsibility to look after the health of the children in their care, and that allowing children easy access to soft drinks violates that responsibility.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bmsg.org/node/210|title=Issue 17: Debates from four states over selling soda in schools|agency=Berkeley Media Studies Group|date=November 1, 2008[/tpl] Vending machine proponents believe that obesity is a complex issue and soft drinks are not the only cause.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailydemocrat.com/ci_23342997/states-soda-tax-plan-falls-flat|title=State's soda tax plan falls flat|agency=Daily Democrat|date=May 29, 2013[/tpl] They also note the immense amount of funding that soft drink sales bring to schools. Some people[tpl]Who|date=October 2008[/tpl] take a more moderate stance, saying that soft drink machines should be allowed in schools, but that they should not be the only option available. They propose that when soft drink vending machines are made available on school grounds, the schools should be required to provide children with a choice of alternative drinks (such as fruit juice, flavored water and milk) at a comparable price. Some lawmakers debating the issue in different states have argued that parents—not the government—should be responsible for children's beverage choices.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/state&id=8093976|work=ABC News Los Angeles|title=Soda tax nixed in state assembly committee|date=April 25, 2011[/tpl]
On May 3, 2006, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, Cadbury Schweppes, The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, and the American Beverage Association announced new School Beverage Guidelines that will voluntarily remove high-calorie soft drinks from all U.S. schools.
On 19 May 2006, the British Education Secretary, Alan Johnson, announced new minimum nutrition standards for school food. Amongst a wide range of measures, from September 2006, school lunches will be free from carbonated drinks. Schools will also end the sale of junk food (including carbonated drinks) in vending machines and tuck shops.

===Taxation===

In the United States and elsewhere, legislators, health experts and consumer advocates are considering levying higher taxes on the sale of soft drinks and other sweetened beverages to help curb the epidemic of obesity among Americans, and its harmful impact on overall health. Some speculate that higher taxes could help reduce soda consumption.[tpl]cite journal|title = Food Price and Diet and Health Outcomes| journal = Archives of Internal Medicine|author = Duffey, et al.|date=8 Mar 2010|url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/170/5/420|pmid = 20212177|doi = 10.1001/archinternmed.2009.545|last2 = Gordon-Larsen|first2 = P|last3 = Shikany|first3 = JM|last4 = Guilkey|first4 = D|last5 = Jacobs Jr|first5 = DR|last6 = Popkin|first6 = BM|volume = 170|issue = 5|pages = 420–6[/tpl] Others say that taxes could help fund education to increase consumer awareness of the unhealthy effects of excessive soft drink consumption, and also help cover costs of caring for conditions resulting from overconsumption.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/weightloss/2009-09-18-soda-tax_N.htm | title = USA Today, Experts: penny per ounce to fight obesity, health costs.

In January 2013, a British lobby group called for the price of sugary fizzy drinks to be increased, with the money raised (an estimated £1 billion at 20p per litre) to be put towards a "Children's Future Fund", overseen by an independent body, which would encourage children to eat healthily in school.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.govtoday.co.uk/health/44-public-health/14591-61-organisations-call-for-a-sugary-drinks-duty |title=61 organisations call for a sugary drinks duty |publisher=Govtoday.co.uk |date=2013-01-29 |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl]

===Bans===

In March 2013, New York City's mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed to ban the sale of non-diet soft drinks larger than 16 ounces, except in convenience stores and supermarkets. A lawsuit against the ban was upheld by a state judge, who voiced concerns that the ban was "fraught with arbitrary and capricious consequences". Bloomberg announced that he would be appealing the verdict.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/03/11/new-york-soda-ban-struck-down-bloomberg-promises-appeal |title=New York Soda Ban Struck Down, Bloomberg Promises Appeal - US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |date=2013-03-11 |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl]
