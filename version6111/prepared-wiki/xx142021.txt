The Xbox 360 is a video game console developed by Microsoft, and is the successor to the original Xbox, and it is the second console in the Xbox series. The Xbox 360 competes with Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. The Xbox 360 was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game information divulged later that month at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3).
The Xbox 360 features an online service, Xbox Live, which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the console's lifetime. Available in free and subscription-based varieties, Xbox Live allows users to: play games online; download games (through Xbox Live Arcade) and game demos; purchase and stream music, television programs, and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications. In addition to online multimedia features, the Xbox 360 allows users to stream media from local PCs. Several peripherals have been released, including wireless controllers, expanded hard drive storage, and the Kinect motion sensing camera. The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, turning it into a hub for living-room computing entertainment.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow_viewer/0,3253,l=251237&a=251237&po=8,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | title=The 10 Greatest Video Game Consoles of All Time[/tpl]http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/steve-ballmer-reboots-01122012.htmlhttp://www.theverge.com/2012/11/13/3633038/microsoft-xbox-360-trojan-horse-living-room[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2397387,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | title=Is the Xbox 360 the Elusive Living Room PC?[/tpl]http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/how-the-xbox-360-won-the-console-war-1196990
Launched worldwide across 2005–2006, the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions, including North America and Europe. The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high failure rate, indicated by the so-called "Red Ring of Death", necessitating an extension of the device's warranty period. Microsoft released two redesigned models of the console: the Xbox 360 S in 2010,[tpl]cite web |url=http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6265465/new-200-xbox-360-planned-elite-and-arcade-getting-50-price-cut |title=New $200 Xbox 360 planned, Elite & Arcade getting $50 price cut |first=Tor |last=Thorsen |date=June 14, 2010 |work=GameSpot |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=2010-06-17 |quote=Moore said that Microsoft is currently working on a second new Xbox 360, which will be offered at the arcade's price point of $200.

===Development===

Known during development as Xbox Next, Xenon, Xbox 2, Xbox FS or NextBox,[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200406/ai_n9520284|title= Microsoft Narrowing Down Xbox Successor's Name?|accessdate= 2008-07-26|first=David|last=Smith|date=June 2004|publisher=Ziff Davis Media| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070517222211/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200406/ai_n9520284| archivedate= 2007-05-17[/tpl] the Xbox 360 was conceived in early 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2006/04/24/the_xbox_360_un/|title=Chronology of Xbox History, 2003|accessdate=2006-11-02|last=Takahashi|first=Dean|date=2006-05-01|publisher=Mercury News[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] In February 2003, planning for the Xenon software platform began, and was headed by Microsoft's Vice President J Allard. That month, Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in Bellevue, Washington to recruit support for the system. Also that month, Peter Moore, former president of Sega of America, joined Microsoft. On August 12, 2003, ATI signed on to produce the graphic processing unit for the new console, a deal which was publicly announced two days later.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1043-5063661.html|title=ATI wins bid for next Xbox|accessdate=2008-07-26|last=Becker| first=David|date=2003-08-14|publisher=CNET[/tpl] Before the launch of the Xbox 360, several Alpha development kits were spotted using Apple's Power Mac G5 hardware. This was because the system's PowerPC 970 processor running the same PowerPC architecture that the Xbox 360 would eventually run under IBM's Xenon processor. The cores of the Xenon processor were developed using a slightly modified version of the PlayStation 3's Cell Processor PPE architecture. According to David Shippy and Mickie Phipps, the IBM employees were "hiding" their work from Sony and Toshiba, IBM's partners in developing the Cell Processor.[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123069467545545011.html|title=Playing the Fool|author=Jonathan V.

===Launch===

The Xbox 360 was released on November 22, 2005, in the United States and Canada; December 2, 2005, in Europe and December 10, 2005, in Japan. It was later launched in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, and Russia. In its first year on the market, the system launched in 36 countries, more countries than any other console has launched in a single year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/739/739880p1.html |title=Microsoft Spreads 360 Love |accessdate=2006-10-18 |last=Perry |first=Douglass  |date=2006-10-17 |publisher=IGN [/tpl]

===Critical reception===

In 2009, IGN named the Xbox 360 the sixth-greatest video game console of all time, out of a field of 25.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top-25-consoles/6.html |title=Xbox 360 is number 6 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2010-11-11[/tpl] Although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential, by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live, and by popularizing game achievement awards. PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it "proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space". Five years after the Xbox 360's original debut, the well-received Kinect motion capture camera was released, which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history, and extended the life of console.http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/breakout/game-over-fastest-selling-tech-device-history-end-130353968.html Edge ranked Xbox 360 the second-best console of the 1993-2013 period, stating "It had its own social network, cross-game chat, new indie games every week, and the best version of just about every multiformat game...Killzone is no Halo and nowadays Gran Turismo is no Forza, but it's not about the exclusives--there's nothing to trump Naughty Dog's PS3 output, after all. Rather, it's about the choices Microsoft made back in the original Xbox's lifetime. The PC-like architecture meant those early EA Sports titles ran at 60fps compared to only 30 on PS3, Xbox Live meant every dedicated player had an existing friends list, and Halo meant Microsoft had the killer next-generation exclusive. And when developers demo games on PC now they do it with a 360 pad--another industry benchmark, and a critical one."[tpl]cite web|author=Edge Staff|title=The ten best consoles: our countdown of the greatest gameboxes of the last 20 years|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/the-ten-best-consoles-the-greatest-gameboxes-from-the-past-20-years/|publisher=Edge Online|date=2013-09-20|accessdate=2014-01-21[/tpl]

Edge magazine reported in August 2011 that initially lacklustre and subsequently falling sales in Japan, where Microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of domestic rivals Sony and Nintendo, had led to retailers scaling down and in some cases discontinuing sales of the Xbox 360 completely.[tpl]cite web|author=Nathan Brown |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/xbox-360-dead-japan |title=Xbox 360: dead in Japan? – Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |accessdate=2011-08-24[/tpl]

===Legacy===

The Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor, and although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, it is regarded as a success since it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well-established rivals. The inexpensive Nintendo Wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third-party software support in its later years, and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in 2012.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/video-games/controller-freak/whats-wrong-with-nintendo/article2219854/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=What's wrong with Nintendo? | date=October 31, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/04/26/nintendo-reports-461-2m-in-losses-is-selling-3ds-below-cost/ | title=Nintendo Reports $461.2M in Losses | work=Forbes | first=Paul | last=Tassi | date=April 26, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/05/10/sony-posts-record-losses-as-playstation-sales-drop/ | title=Cardiac Arrests At Sony, Nintendo As Consoles Show Their Age | work=Forbes | first=Paul | last=Tassi[/tpl]http://metro.co.uk/2013/11/27/xbox-one-v-playstation-4-who-will-win-the-next-gen-console-race-4201485/[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-02/nintendo-seen-missing-target-as-sony-microsoft-sales-dwarf-wii-u.html | work=Bloomberg | title=Nintendo Seen Missing Target as Sony-Microsoft Dwarf Wii U[/tpl] The PlayStation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality titles,http://www.womencitizen.com/technology-22/three-strategy-lessons-from-the-latest-round-of-xbox-vs-playstation-2827.html making it far less dominant than its predecessor, the PlayStation 2, and it took until late in the PlayStation 3's lifespan for its sales and game titles to reach parity with the Xbox 360. TechRadar proclaimed that "Xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill - a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor, Xbox One".
The Xbox 360's advantage over its competitors was due to the release of high profile titles from both first party and third party developers. The 2007 Game Critics Awards honored the platform with 38 nominations and 12 wins – more than any other platform.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gamecriticsawards.com/nom-stats-2007.html |title=2007 Nominee Fast Facts |publisher=Game Critics Awards |accessdate=2008-06-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gamecriticsawards.com/win-stats-2007.html |title=2007 Winners Fast Facts |publisher=Game Critics Awards |accessdate=2008-06-25[/tpl] By March 2008, the Xbox 360 had reached a software attach rate of 7.5 games per console in the US; the rate was 7.0 in Europe, while its competitors were 3.8 (PS3) and 3.5 (Wii), according to Microsoft.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thebitbag.com/2008/04/17/xbox-360-comes-in-2nd-for-march-sales/|title=Xbox 360 Comes in 2nd For March Sales |author=Torrence Davis |publisher=The Bitbag |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-23[/tpl] At the 2008 Game Developers Conference, Microsoft announced that it expected over 1,000 games available for Xbox 360 by the end of the year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thatvideogameblog.com/2008/02/20/microsoft-keynote-reveals-xbox-stats/|title=Microsoft keynote reveals Xbox stats |author=Rain Anderson |publisher=That VideoGame Blog |date=20 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-25[/tpl] As well as enjoying exclusives such as additions to the Halo franchise and Gears of War, the Xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of titles that were initially planned to be PS3 exclusives, including Devil May Cry,[tpl]cite web |title=Official Press Release on DMC4 going Multiplatform |publisher=Capcom |date=20 March 2007 |url=http://ir.capcom.co.jp/english/news/html/e070320.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071028084439/http://ir.capcom.co.jp/english/news/html/e070320.html |archivedate=28 October 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-25[/tpl] Ace Combat,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.namcobandaigames.com/news/press/press/199/page/1 |title=Namco Bandai Games announces the worldwide launch of Ace Combat 6: fires of liberation for the Xbox 360 |publisher=Namco Bandai |accessdate=2008-06-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011174922/http://namcobandaigames.com/news/press/press/199/page/1 |archivedate=11 October 2007[/tpl] Virtua Fighter,[tpl]cite web |last=McWhertor |first=Michael |title=PS3 Loses Another Exclusive, Virtua Fighter 5 Comes to 360| publisher=Kotaku |date=21 December 2006 |url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/sega/ps3-loses-another-exclusive-virtua-fighter-5-comes-to-360-223566.php |accessdate=2007-10-25[/tpl] Grand Theft Auto IV,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/grandtheftauto4/news.html?sid=6151640&mode=all |title=Grand Theft Auto IV Comes to Xbox 360 on Day One |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=2008-05-24[/tpl] Final Fantasy XIII,[tpl]cite web|url=http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/tag/36/Videogames.html#687020|title=Final Fantasy XIII Comes to the 360|publisher=X-Play|accessdate=2008-07-14[/tpl] Tekken 6,[tpl]cite web|last=Ramsay |first=Randolph |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6198775.html?sid=6198775 |title=TGS 2008: Tekken 6 smacking Xbox 360 – News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=8 October 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-05[/tpl] Metal Gear Solid : Rising,[tpl]cite web|first=Stephen|last=Totilo |url=http://kotaku.com/5277716/sony-expects-metal-gear-solid-rising-on-ps3-at-launch |title=Sony Expects Metal Gear Solid Rising on PS3 at Launch |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=3 June 2009 |accessdate=2011-06-14[/tpl] and L.A.

TechRadar deemed the Xbox 360 as the most influential game system through its emphasis of digital media distribution, Xbox Live online gaming service, and game achievement feature. During the console's lifetime, the Xbox brand has grown from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, turning it into a hub for "living-room computing environment". Five years after the Xbox 360's original debut, the well-received Kinect motion capture camera was released, which became the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history, and extended the life of the console.
Microsoft announced the Xbox One, successor to the Xbox 360, at E3 on June 10, 2013. Although succeeded as Microsoft's main console by the Xbox One, support from publishers for the Xbox 360 is expected to continue until at least 2017.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/xbox-360-and-ps3-support-to-continue-until-2017-despite-xbox-one-and-ps4-unveilings |title=Xbox 360 and PS3 support to continue until 2017 despite Xbox One and PS4 unveilings |publisher=trustedreviews.com  |accessdate=2013-08-24[/tpl]

==Hardware==

The main unit of the Xbox 360 itself has slight double concavity in matte white or black. The official color of the white model is Arctic Chill. It features a port on the top when vertical (left side when horizontal) to which a custom-housed hard disk drive unit can be attached.

===Technical specifications===

Various hard disk drives have been produced, including options at 20, 60, 120, 250, or 320 GB. Inside, the Xbox 360 uses the triple-core IBM designed Xenon as its CPU, with each core capable of simultaneously processing two threads, and can therefore operate on up to six threads at once.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/support/xbox360/manuals/xbox360specs.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822024003/http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/support/xbox360/manuals/xbox360specs.htm|archivedate=2008-08-22 |title=Xbox 360 Technical Specifications |publisher=Xbox.com  |accessdate=2009-09-10[/tpl] Graphics processing is handled by the ATI Xenos, which has 10 MB of eDRAM.

====Kinect====

Kinect is a "controller-free gaming and entertainment experience" for the Xbox 360. It was first announced on June 1, 2009 at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, under the codename, Project Natal. The add-on peripheral enables users to control and interact with the Xbox 360 without a game controller by using gestures, spoken commands and presented objects and images. The Kinect accessory is compatible with all Xbox 360 models,[tpl]cite web|url=http://wireninja.com/xbox-360-fat-slim-comparison/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101225023543/http://wireninja.com/xbox-360-fat-slim-comparison/ |archivedate=2010-12-25 |title=Xbox 360 Fat & Slim Comparison |publisher=Wireninja.com |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2013-01-31[/tpl] connecting to new models via a custom connector, and to older ones via a USB and mains power adapter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5520812/project-natal--its-instruction-manual-in-the-wild|title=Project Natal & Its Instruction Manual(!)

===Retail configurations===

At launch, the Xbox 360 was available in two configurations: the "Xbox 360" package (unofficially known as the 20 GB Pro or Premium), priced at US$399 or GB£279.99, and the "Xbox 360 Core", priced at US$299 and GB£209.99. The original shipment of the Xbox 360 version included a cut-down version of the Media Remote as a promotion. The Elite package was launched later at US$479.

===Technical problems===

The Xbox 360 has been subject to a number of technical problems. Since the console's release in 2005, users have reported concerns over its reliability and failure rate.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_6270000/newsid_6277700/6277716.stm|title=Microsoft admit Xbox problems|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-02-13 | date=2007-07-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/rings-of-red|title=Rings of Red|publisher=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.1up.com/news/tale-11-broken-360s|title= A Tale of 11 Broken Xbox 360s|accessdate= 2008-07-26|author= Philip Kollar|date= 2007-06-26|publisher= Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc[/tpl]
To aid customers with defective consoles, Microsoft extended the Xbox 360's manufacturer's warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that generate a "General Hardware Failure" error report. A "General Hardware Failure" is recognized on all models released before the Xbox 360 S by three quadrants of the ring around the power button flashing red. This error is often known as the "Red Ring of Death".[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/xbox360/hardware/warranty/warrantyupdate/WarrantyUpdate.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070605083902/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/systemuse/xbox360/resources/warrantyupdate.htm|archivedate=2007-06-05|title=Xbox 360 Warranty Coverage Expanded|accessdate= 2008-07-26|author=Microsoft|date= 2007-06-05[/tpl] In April 2009 the warranty was extended to also cover failures related to the E74 error code.[tpl]cite web|url=http://majornelson.com/2009/04/14/xbox-360-warranty-extended-for-e74/|title=Xbox 360 Warranty extended for E74|publisher=majornelson.com|accessdate=2009-04-17[/tpl] The warranty extension is not granted for any other types of failures that do not generate these specific error codes.
Since these problems surfaced, Microsoft has attempted to modify the console to improve its reliability. Modifications include a reduction in the number, size, and placement of components, the addition of dabs of epoxy on the corners and edges of the CPU and GPU as glue to prevent movement relative to the board during heat expansion,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.llamma.com/xbox360/news/inside_the_xbox_360_elite.htm|title=Inside the Xbox 360 Elite|publisher=The Llamma's Adventures|date=2007-04-19|accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl] and a second GPU heatsink to dissipate more heat.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.xbox-scene.com/xbox1data/sep/EElEZukFEleqkRrcnN.php|title= New Pictures of 2nd GPU HeatSink on Xbox 360|accessdate= 2008-07-26|author= XanTium |date= 2007-06-13|publisher= Xbox-Scene[/tpl] With the release of the redesigned Xbox 360 S, the warranty for the newer models does not include the three-year extended coverage for "General Hardware Failures".[tpl]cite web |url=http://support.xbox.com/en-us/pages/xbox-360/troubleshoot/warranty/xbox-360-new-warranty.aspx |title=Product Warranty and Software License: New Xbox 360 Console |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2011-01-10 |quote="Warranty Period" for Xbox 360 S, means 1-year from the date You purchased the Xbox 360 S from an authorized retailer[/tpl] The newer Xbox 360 S model indicates system overheating when the console's power button begins to flash red, unlike previous models where the first and third quadrant of the ring would light up red around the power button if overheating occurred.

===Interface===

The Xbox 360's original graphical user interface was the Xbox 360 Dashboard; a tabbed interface that featured five "Blades" (formerly four blades), and was designed by AKQA and Audiobrain. It could be launched automatically when the console booted without a disc in it, or when the disc tray was ejected, but the user had the option to select what the console does if a game is in the tray on start up, or if inserted when already on. A simplified version of it was also accessible at any time via the Xbox Guide button on the gamepad. This simplified version showed the user's gamercard, Xbox Live messages and friends list. It also allowed for personal and music settings, in addition to voice or video chats, or returning to the Xbox Dashboard from the game.
On November 19, 2008, the Xbox 360's dashboard was changed from the "Blade" interface, to a dashboard reminiscent of that present on the Zune and Windows Media Center, known as the "New Xbox Experience" or NXE.
Since the console's release, Microsoft has released several updates for the Dashboard software. These updates have included adding new features to the console, enhancing Xbox Live functionality and multimedia playback capabilities, adding compatibility for new accessories, and fixing bugs in the software. Such updates are mandatory for users wishing to use Xbox Live, as access to Xbox Live is disabled until the update is performed.

====New Xbox Experience====

At E3 2008, at Microsoft's Show, Microsoft's Aaron Greenberg and Marc Whitten announced the new Xbox 360 interface called the "New Xbox Experience" (NXE). The update was intended to ease console menu navigation. Its GUI uses the Twist UI, previously used in Windows Media Center and the Zune. Its new Xbox Guide retains all Dashboard functionality (including the Marketplace browser and disk ejection) and the original "Blade" interface.
The NXE also provides many new features. Users can now install games from disc to the hard drive to play them with reduced load time and less disc drive noise, but each game's disc must remain in the system in order to run. A new, built-in Community system allows the creation of digitized Avatars that can be used for multiple activities, such as sharing photos or playing Arcade games like 1 vs. 100.
