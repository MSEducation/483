A project that started since 1990 is in the works to relocate NC 119 west of Mebane, creating a new 4 to 6-lane divided highway from I-40/I-85 to Mrs. White Lane (SR 1918).  The project will be broken into two parts, with a combined estimate of $101.9 million; property acquisition is expected after 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncdot.gov/projects/nc119relocation/|title=NCDOT: NC 119 Relocation Project|accessdate=2011-11-24[/tpl]
