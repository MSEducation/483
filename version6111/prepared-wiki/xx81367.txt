==Plot==

After stealing a pistol from a Nazi sailor, Pin searches for an identity with a partisan group. All the while, the people he meets mock him without his knowing. The title refers to Pin's secret hiding place, directions to which he touts as a prize to any adults who win his trust.

==Reception==

Some critics[tpl]who|date=February 2012[/tpl] view the work as unexceptional, on the grounds that it fails to address the issues other than from a very naive perspective; others[tpl]who|date=February 2012[/tpl] credit it with being skillfully written 
and make a virtue of its portrayal of the complex emotions and politics of adults, as seen through the eyes of a child. However one passage about prisoners-of-war being made to dig their own grave before being shot is universally regarded as impressive.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
