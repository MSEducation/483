==Aquaculture==

Although Yellow River is generally less suitable for aquaculture than the rivers of central and southern China, such as the Yangtze or the Pearl River, aquaculture is practiced in some areas along the Yellow River as well. An important aquaculture area is the riverside plain in Xingyang City, upstream from Zhengzhou. Since the development of fish ponds started in Xingyang's riverside Wangcun Town in 1986, the pond systems in Wangcun have grown to the total size of 15,000 mu (10 km2), making the town the largest aquaculture center in North China.黄河畔的荥阳市万亩鱼塘 (Ten thousand of mu of fish ponds in the riverside Xingyang), 2011-09-30
A variety of the Chinese softshell turtle popular with China's gourmets is called the Yellow River Turtle (黄河鳖). Now-a-days most of Yellow River Turtles eaten in China's restaurants comes from turtle farms, which may or may not be located near the actual Yellow River. 
In 2007, construction started in Wangcun on a large farm for raising this turtle variety. With the capacity for raising 5 million turtles a year, the facility was expected to become Henan's largest farm of this kind.荥阳开建河南省最大黄河鳖养殖基地 (Construction started in Xingyang on the province's largest Yellow River Turtle farm), www.zynews.com,　 2007-07-24

==Pollution==

On 25 November 2008, Tania Branigan of The Guardian filed a report "China's Mother River: the Yellow River", claiming that severe pollution has made one-third of China's Yellow River unusable even for agricultural or industrial use, due to factory discharges and sewage from fast-expanding cities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/nov/25/water-china|title= One-third of China's Yellow River 'unfit for drinking or agriculture'  Factory waste and sewage from growing cities has severely polluted major waterway, according to Chinese research|author=Branigan, Tania  |date=25 November 2008|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=14 March 2009[/tpl] The Yellow River Conservancy Commission had surveyed more than [tpl]convert|8384|mi|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl] of the river in 2007 and said 33.8% of the river system registered worse than "level five" according the criteria used by the UN Environment Program.[tpl]dubious|no river on Earth is that long|date=March 2013[/tpl] Level five is unfit for drinking, aquaculture, industrial use, or even agriculture.

==Yellow River in culture==

In ancient times, it was believed that the Yellow River flowed from Heaven as a continuation of the Milky Way. In a Chinese legend, Zhang Qian is said to have been commissioned to find the source of the Yellow River. After sailing up-river for many days, he saw a girl spinning and a cow herd. Upon asking the girl where he was, she presented him with her shuttle with instructions to show it to the astrologer Yen Chün-p'ing. When he returned, the astrologer recognized it as the shuttle of the Weaving Girl (Vega), and, moreover, said that at the time Zhang received the shuttle, he had seen a wandering star interpose itself between the Weaving Girl and the cow herd (Altair).[tpl]ChineseBioDict|Chang Chên-chou[/tpl]
The provinces of Hebei and Henan derive their names from the Yellow River. Their names mean, respectively, "North of the River" and "South of the River".
Traditionally, it is believed that the Chinese civilization originated in the Yellow River basin. The Chinese refer to the river as "the Mother River" and "the cradle of the Chinese civilization".
During the long history of China, the Yellow River has been considered a blessing as well as a curse and has been nicknamed both "China's Pride" (
) and "China's Sorrow"Cheng, Linsun and Brown, Kerry (2009) Berkshire encyclopedia of China, Berkshire Publishing Group, p. 1125 ISBN 978-0-9770159-4-8 (
).
Sometimes the Yellow River is poetically called the "Muddy Flow" ([tpl]zh|s=[tpl]linktext|浊|流[/tpl]|t=[tpl]linktext|濁|流[/tpl]|p=[tpl]linktext|Zhuó| Liú[/tpl][/tpl]). The Chinese idiom "when the Yellow River flows clear" is used to refer to an event that will never happen and is similar to the English expression "when pigs fly".
"The Yellow River running clear"  was reported as a good omen during the reign of the Yongle Emperor, along with the appearance of such auspicious legendary beasts as qilin (an African giraffe brought to China by a Bengal embassy aboard Zheng He's ships in 1414) and zouyu (not positively identified) and other strange natural phenomena.
