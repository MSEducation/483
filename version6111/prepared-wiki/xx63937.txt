Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor in terms of pollution. Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.[ref]

There are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures. The scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant, depending on specific circumstances. Although many artificial structures can kill birds, wind power has a disproportionate effect on certain endangered bird species. An especially vulnerable group are raptors, which are slow to reproduce and favor the high wind speed corridors that wind turbine companies build turbines in, to maximize energy production.  Although they have a negligible effect on most birds, in some locations there is a disproportionate effects on some birds of conservation concern, such as the golden eagle and raptor species.
However, a large meta-analysis of 616 individual studies on electricity production and its effects on avian mortality concluded that the most visible impacts of wind technology are not necessarily the most flagrant ones, as:

Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities, and protection of peat bogs, affect the siting and operation of wind turbines.
There are anecdotal reports of negative effects from noise on people who live very close to wind turbines. Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these statements.W. David Colby, Robert Dobie, Geoff Leventhall, David M. Lipscomb, Robert J. McCunney, Michael T. Seilo, Bo Søndergaard.

==Politics==

===Central government===

Fossil fuels are subsidized by many governments, and wind power and other forms of renewable energy are also often subsidized. For example a 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002–2008 period.  The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74 billion for energy subsidies to support R&D for nuclear power ($50 billion) and fossil fuels ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003.  During this same time frame, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US$26 billion.  It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help to level the playing field and support growing energy sectors, namely solar power, wind power, and biofuels.  History shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies.Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007). The Clean Tech Revolution: The Next Big Growth and Investment Opportunity, p. 280.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) (2011), energy subsidies artificially lower the price of energy paid by consumers, raise the price received by producers or lower the cost of production. "Fossil fuels subsidies costs generally outweigh the benefits. Subsidies to renewables and low-carbon energy technologies can bring long-term economic and environmental benefits".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/docs/weo2011/factsheets.pdf |title=World Energy Outlook 2011 Factsheet How will global energy markets evolve to 2035?|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120204112700/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/docs/weo2011/factsheets.pdf|archivedate=4 February 2012 |publisher=IEA |date=November 2011[/tpl] In November 2011, an IEA report entitled Deploying Renewables 2011 said "subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits". The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand.
In the US, the wind power industry has recently increased its lobbying efforts considerably, spending about $5 million in 2009 after years of relative obscurity in Washington. By comparison, the US nuclear industry alone spent over $650 million on its lobbying efforts and campaign contributions during a single ten-year period ending in 2008.Ward, Chip.

Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, Germany's federal government is working on a new plan for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy commercialization, with a particular focus on offshore wind farms. Under the plan, large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines, where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land, and where the enormous turbines won't bother the inhabitants. The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,752791,00.html |title=Will Nuke Phase-Out Make Offshore Farms Attractive? |author=Schultz, Stefan |date=23 March 2011 |work=Der Spiegel [/tpl]
Commenting on the EU's 2020 renewable energy target, economist Professor Dieter Helm is critical of how the costs of wind power are cited by lobbyists. Helm also says that the problem of intermittent supply will probably lead to another dash for gas or dash for coal in Europe, possibly with a negative impact on energy security.[tpl]cite journal|last=Helm |first=Dieter|date=October 2009|title=EU climate-change policy—a critique|journal=The Economics and Politics of Climate Change|publisher=OUP|url=http://www.dieterhelm.co.uk/sites/default/files/SS_EU_CC_Critique_0.pdf[/tpl] A House of Lords Select Committee report (2008) on renewable energy in the UK reported a "concern over the prospective role of wind generated and other intermittent sources of electricity in the UK, in the absence of a break-through in electricity storage technology or the integration of the UK grid with that of continental Europe".

===Public opinion===

Surveys of public attitudes across Europe and in many other countries show strong public support for wind power.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/WD/WD22vi_public.pdf |title=A Summary of Opinion Surveys on Wind Power |format=PDF |accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20120504073200/http://eon-uk.com/generation/publicattitudes.aspx |title=Public attitudes to wind farms |publisher=Eon-uk.com |date=28 February 2008 |accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl] About 80% of EU citizens support wind power.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/environment/chapter-6-social-acceptance-of-wind-energy-and-wind-farms/ |title=The Social Acceptance of Wind Energy |work=European Commission [/tpl]
In Germany, where wind power has gained very high social acceptance, hundreds of thousands of people have invested in citizens' wind farms across the country and thousands of small and medium sized enterprises are running successful businesses in a new sector that in 2008 employed 90,000 people and generated 8% of Germany's electricity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/technology/my-take/community-wind-farm.html |title=Community Power Empowers|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090325021002/http://dsc.discovery.com/technology/my-take/community-wind-farm.html |archivedate=25 March 2009|publisher=Dsc.discovery.com |date=26 May 2009 |accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://nccnsw.org.au/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=2148 |title=Community Wind Farms|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080720132956/http://nccnsw.org.au/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=2148|archivedate=20 July 2008[/tpl] Although wind power is a popular form of energy generation, the construction of wind farms is not universally welcomed, often for aesthetic reasons.[tpl]cite web|title=Carbon footprint of electricity generation|publisher=UK Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology|date=October 2006|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/postpn268.pdf|location=Postnote Number 268|accessdate=7 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/energy.htm|title=Energy|accessdate=31 October 2012[/tpl]
In Spain, with some exceptions, there has been little opposition to the installation of inland wind parks. However, the projects to build offshore parks have been more controversial. In particular, the proposal of building the biggest offshore wind power production facility in the world in southwestern Spain in the coast of Cádiz, on the spot of the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar.  has been met with strong opposition who fear for tourism and fisheries in the area,Las eólicas preparan su inmersión 4 June 2009 [tpl]es icon[/tpl] and because the area is a war grave.
In a survey conducted by Angus Reid Strategies in October 2007, 89 per cent of respondents said that using renewable energy sources like wind or solar power was positive for Canada, because these sources were better for the environment. Only 4 per cent considered using renewable sources as negative since they can be unreliable and expensive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.angus-reid.com/uppdf/ARS_Energy.pdf |title=Canadians favour energy sources that are better for the environment|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090318232442/http://www.angus-reid.com/uppdf/ARS_Energy.pdf|archivedate=18 March 2009[/tpl] According to a Saint Consulting survey in April 2007, wind power was the alternative energy source most likely to gain public support for future development in Canada, with only 16% opposed to this type of energy.

A 2003 survey of residents living around Scotland's 10 existing wind farms found high levels of community acceptance and strong support for wind power, with much support from those who lived closest to the wind farms. The results of this survey support those of an earlier Scottish Executive survey 'Public attitudes to the Environment in Scotland 2002', which found that the Scottish public would prefer the majority of their electricity to come from renewables, and which rated wind power as the cleanest source of renewable energy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bwea.com/media/news/goodneighbours.html |title=Wind farms make good neighbours|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120215024756/http://www.bwea.com/media/news/goodneighbours.html|archivedate=15 February 2012[/tpl] A survey conducted in 2005 showed that 74% of people in Scotland agree that wind farms are necessary to meet current and future energy needs. When people were asked the same question in a Scottish renewables study conducted in 2010, 78% agreed. The increase is significant as there were twice as many wind farms in 2010 as there were in 2005. The 2010 survey also showed that 52% disagreed with the statement that wind farms are "ugly and a blot on the landscape". 59% agreed that wind farms were necessary and that how they looked was unimportant.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11569466 |title='Rise in Scots wind farm support' |date=19 October 2010 [/tpl] Scotland is planning to obtain 100% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020.[tpl]cite journal |url=https://windenergyigert.umass.edu/sites/windenergyigert/files/OFFSHORE%20WIND%20SCOTLAND%202012.pdf |title=An investigation into the potential barriers facing the development of offshore wind energy in Scotland: Case study – Firth of Forth offshore wind farm|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2012.03.018 |year=2012 |last1=o’Keeffe |first1=Aoife |last2=Haggett |first2=Claire |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=3711[/tpl]
In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects.

==Small-scale wind power==

Small-scale wind power is the name given to wind generation systems with the capacity to produce up to 50 kW of electrical power. Isolated communities, that may otherwise rely on diesel generators, may use wind turbines as an alternative. Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electricity for economic reasons, or to reduce their carbon footprint. Wind turbines have been used for household electricity generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas.[ref]
</ref>
Grid-connected domestic wind turbines may use grid energy storage, thus replacing purchased electricity with locally produced power when available. The surplus power produced by domestic microgenerators can, in some jurisdictions, be fed into the network and sold to the utility company, producing a retail credit for the microgenerators' owners to offset their energy costs.
Off-grid system users can either adapt to intermittent power or use batteries, photovoltaic or diesel systems to supplement the wind turbine. Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing the need for a connection to the power grid.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2009/05/13/exploiting-the-downsides-of-wind-and-solar/|title=Wind, Solar-Powered Street Lights Only Need a Charge Once Every Four Days|last=Kart|first=Jeff|date=13 May 2009|work=Clean Technica|publisher=Clean Technica|accessdate=30 April 2012[/tpl]
A Carbon Trust study into the potential of small-scale wind energy in the UK, published in 2010, found that small wind turbines could provide up to 1.5 terawatt hours (TW·h) per year of electricity (0.4% of total UK electricity consumption), saving 0.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2) emission savings. This is based on the assumption that 10% of households would install turbines at costs competitive with grid electricity, around 12 pence (US 19 cents) a kW·h. A report prepared for the UK's government-sponsored Energy Saving Trust in 2006, found that home power generators of various kinds could provide 30 to 40% of the country's electricity needs by 2050.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hamer|first=Mick|date=21 January 2006|title=The rooftop power revolution |journal=New Scientist|publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd.|issue=2535|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18925351.400-the-rooftop-power-revolution.html?full=true#bx253514B1|accessdate=11 April 2012[/tpl]
Distributed generation from renewable resources is increasing as a consequence of the increased awareness of climate change. The electronic interfaces required to connect renewable generation units with the utility system can include additional functions, such as the active filtering to enhance the power quality.
