</ref><br>It is also now known that breast milk contains a unique type of sugars, [[oligosaccharides]], which are long chains of complex sugars. So far scientists have identified 140 of them and estimate there are about 200.  These types of sugars are found nowhere else in nature, and not every mother produces the same ones, since they vary by blood type. However, the oligosaccharides are not digestible by infants and are instead meant to feed the beneficial bacteria that live in the intestine and help to fight infections. Also found in breast milk are endo-[[cannabinoids]], which may act as an appetite stimulant, but they also regulate appetite so infants don't eat too much. That may be why formula-fed babies have a higher caloric intake than breastfed babies.<ref>[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/16/breasts-breastfeeding-milk-florence-williams | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Florence | last=Williams | title=The wonder of breasts | date=2012-06-16[/tpl]</ref>
The breast milk of diabetic mothers has been shown to have a different composition from that of non-diabetic mothers. It may contain elevated levels of glucose and insulin and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids. A dose-dependent effect of diabetic breast milk on increasing language delays in infants has also been noted, although doctors recommend that diabetic mothers breastfeed despite this potential risk.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rodekamp E, Harder T, Kohlhoff R, Dudenhausen JW, Plagemann A |title=Impact of breast-feeding on psychomotor and neuropsychological development in children of diabetic mothers: role of the late neonatal period |journal=Journal of Perinatal Medicine |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=490–6 |year=2006 |pmid=17140300 |doi=10.1515/JPM.2006.095 |url=[/tpl]
Women breastfeeding should consult with their physician regarding substances that can be unwittingly passed to the infant via breast milk, such as alcohol, viruses (HIV or HTLV-1) or medications.
Most women that do not breastfeed use infant formula, but breast milk donated by volunteers to human milk banks can be obtained by prescription in some countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/breastfeeding/index.cfm?page=359 |title=Breastfeeding | Health benefits for mother and baby |publisher=womenshealth.gov |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2011-10-26[/tpl]
Mother's breast milk provides a higher proportion of cholesterol than almost any other food. It also contains over 50% of its calories as fat, much of it saturated fat. Both cholesterol and saturated fat are essential for growth in babies and children, especially the development of the brain. Most commercial formulas are low in saturated fats and soy formulas are completely devoid of cholesterol. A recent study linked lowfat diets with failure to thrive in children.Fallon, Sally.

==Storage of expressed breast milk==

Expressed breast milk can be stored for later use. It is recommended that the milk be stored in hard-sided containers with airtight seals .[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Some plastic bags specifically manufactured for the storage of expressed breast milk are designed for storage periods of less than 72 hours - others can be used for up to 12 months if frozen. The amount of time that it can be safely stored for use by infants in a home-based situation is given in this table.Protocol #8: Human milk storage information for home use for healthy full-term infants. Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Protocol.

==Comparison to other milks==

All mammalian species produce milk, but the composition of milk for each species varies widely and other kinds of milk are often very different from human breast milk.  As a rule, the milk of mammals that nurse frequently (including human babies) is less rich, or more watery, than the milk of mammals whose young nurse less often.  Human milk is noticeably thinner and sweeter than cow's milk.
Whole cow's milk contains too little iron, retinol, vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin D, unsaturated fats or essential fatty acids for human babies.Department of Health, 1994. Weaning and the weaning diet. Report of the Working Group on the Weaning Diet of the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy. London: HMSO. Report on Health and Social Subjects No 45.Vegetarian & Vegan FoundationVegetarian & Vegan FoundationFSA, 2002. McCance and Widdowson’s The Composition of Foods, 6th summary edition. Cambridge, England, Royal Society of Chemistry.  Whole cow's milk also contains too much protein, sodium, potassium, phosphorus and chloride which may put a strain on an infant's immature kidneys.  In addition, the proteins, fats and calcium in whole cow's milk are more difficult for an infant to digest and absorb than the ones in breast milk.MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Cow's milk for infants and childrenMartinez, G.A., Ryan, A.S. and Malec, D.J. 1985. Nutrient intakes of American infants and children fed cow's milk or infant formula. American Journal of Diseases in Children. 139 (10) 1010-8.  Evaporated milk may be easier to digest due to the processing of the protein but is still nutritionally inadequate. Some infants are allergic to cow's milk protein, this problem affecting infant formulas derived from cow's milk.[tpl]cite pmid|14583987[/tpl]

==Alternative uses for breast milk==

In addition to providing essential nourishment to infants, human milk; i.e., breast milk, has a number of valuable uses, especially medicinal uses, for both children and adults. It has been used medicinally for thousands of years.Newsvine.com. The Milk Of Human Kindness: Uses For Human Breast Milk http://daniel-slack.newsvine.com/_news/2009/04/26/2733785-the-milk-of-human-kindness-uses-for-human-breast-milkBella Online: Medicinal Uses of Breast milk  http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art41924.asp Breast milk contains strong antibodies and antitoxins that many people believe promote healing and better overall health. However, breast milk lacks sterile and antiseptic properties if a nursing mother is infected with certain communicable diseases, such as HIV and CMV, as breast milk can transmit such diseases to infants and other people.New England Journal of Medicine Breast Milk & Risk of CMV 1980 http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/citation/302/19/1073[tpl]cite pmid|22719248[/tpl]
Breast milk has been used as a home remedy for minor ailments, such as conjunctivitis, insect bites and stings, contact dermatitis, and infected wounds, burns, and abrasions. Breast milk has also been used alternatively to boost the immune system of ill persons having viral gastroenteritis, influenza, the common cold, pneumonia, etc., because of its immunologic properties. However, breast milk should never be seen or construed as a "cure-all". Some medical experts are convinced that breast milk can induce apoptosis in some types of cancer cells.  However, more research and evidence are needed in this area of cancer treatment.[tpl]cite journal| author=Hallgren O, Aits S, Brest P, Gustafsson L, Mossberg AK, Wullt B, Svanborg C| title=Apoptosis and tumor cell death in response to HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells| year=2008| journal=Adv Exp Med Biol.| volume=606| pages=217–40| pmid=18183931| doi=10.1007/978-0-387-74087-4_8[/tpl]
A minority of people, including restaurateurs Hans Lochen of Switzerland and Daniel Angerer of Austria, who operates a restaurant in New York City, have used human breast milk, or at least advocated its use, as a substitute for cow's milk in dairy products and food recipes.New York Daily News: Restaurant Drops Plan to Cook with Breast Milk http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2008/09/18/2008-09-18_restaurant_drops_plan_to_cook_with_breas.html Tammy Frissell-Deppe, a family counselor specialized in attachment parenting, published a book, titled A Breastfeeding Mother's Secret Recipes, providing a lengthy compilation of detailed food and beverage recipes containing human breast milk.Tammy Frissell-Deppe. A Breastfeeding Mother's Secret Recipes: Breast milk Recipes, Fun Food for Kids and Quick Dishes!. Dracut, MA: JED Publishing, 2002 The animal rights organization known as PETA ignited a firestorm of criticism when it urged a dairy company to replace the cow's milk they use in their ice cream products with human breast milk as a way to stop cattle abuse.PETA.org: The Breast Is Best! PETA Asks Ben & Jerry's to Dump Dairy and Go With Human Milk Instead http://www.peta.org/mc/NewsItem.asp?id=11993WPTZ.com: PETA Urges Ben & Jerry's To Use Human Milk Human breast milk is not produced or distributed industrially or commercially, because the use of human breast milk as an adult food is considered unusual to the majority of cultures around the world, and most disapprove of such a practice.Jelliffe, Derrick B., and E. F. Patrice Jelliffe. Human Milk in the Modern World. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1978.
Attempts to formulate soap from breast milk have also been made, and those using it claim that its effectiveness as a cleanser is greater than, or equal to, that of traditional soaps.The Traditional Midwife: Mother's Milk Soap http://traditionalmidwife.com/mothersmilksoap.html

==Passing of unwanted substances==

Despite the risk of substances transmitting from the mother to the child through breast milk, breastfeeding has far more advantages than infant formulas, and, with few exceptions, the WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life.http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/gs_infant_feeding_text_eng.pdf
The milk-producing cells are most permeable to drugs during the first postpartum week.breastfeedingbasics.org - a site for parents developed by pediatricians --> Breastfeeding & Drugs: Does the medication pass into the breast milk? Retrieved on June 19, 2009
Drug characteristics that increase excretion in milk include:
Drugs are transferred from blood plasma across ductal cells to the milk by diffusion or active transport. The latter may result in higher concentration of the drug in the breast milk than in the plasma of the mother.
The amounts of most drugs in milk do not exceed 2% of the total ingested dose.

===Environmental pollutants===

Environmental pollutants found in breast milk are usually not harmful, and should be considered only when environmental levels are unusually high. In addition, there has been a decrease in environmental levels, also resulting in a decrease breast-milk levels. Pollutants that are of most concern are pesticides, organic mercury, and lead. DDT and dieldrin are unavoidable, and can also be detected in infant formulas.kidsgrowth.org --> Drugs and Other Substances in Breast Milk Retrieved on June 19, 2009 Pesticides and other toxic substances bioaccumulate; i.e., creatures higher up the food chain will store more of them in their body fat. This is an issue in particular for the Inuit, whose traditional diet is predominantly meat. Studies are looking at the effects of polychlorinated biphenyls and persistent organic pollutants in the body; the breast milk of Inuit mothers is extraordinarily high in toxic compounds.Silent Snow: The Slow Poisoning of the Arctic by Marla Cone, Grove Press.
Persistent toxins were first discovered in breast milk in 1951, when a group of mothers were tested for the pesticide DDT. In 1966, a Swedish researcher found that his wife's breast milk contained polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and five years later Sweden banned PCB's, with the United States following a few years later. But because of their widespread use and persistence, they are still the highest-concentration toxins in breast milk. Most scientists maintain that prenatal exposure to PCB's can do real damage. Researchers in the Great Lakes region, the Arctic and the Netherlands found that babies born to mothers with mid- to upper-range background levels of PCB contamination (most likely because of diets rich in contaminated fish and animal products) have reduced immunities against infections, lower I.Q.'s and delayed learning capabilities, with some problems lasting  at least into early adolescence.  However, researchers were surprised to learn that although the children who were breast-fed had higher PCB levels than children who were not breastfed, they consistently performed better than those who drank formula—breast milk appeared to be at least partly protective against the effects of toxic chemicals.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/09/magazine/09TOXIC.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Florence | last=Williams | title=Toxic Breast Milk? | date=2005-01-09[/tpl]
In 1981 researchers  in the U.S. discovered the flame retardant PBDE in stored human milk samples.  Testing showed that between the early 70s when the chemical first came into use and up to 1998, levels of PBDE's in breast milk were doubling every five years and levels were found to be 10 to 100 times higher than those of women in Europe and Japan.

==Market==

There is a market for human breast milk, both in the form of wet nurse service and milk product. As a product, breast milk is exchanged by human milk banks as well as directly between milk donors and customers mediated by websites on the Internet. Human milk banks generally have standardized measures for screening donors and storing the milk, while donors on websites vary in regard to these measures. A study in 2013 came to the result that 74% of breast milk samples from providers found from websites were colonized with Gram-negative bacteria or had more than 10.000 colony-forming units/mL of aerobic bacteria.[tpl]cite doi|10.1542/peds.2013-1687[/tpl] The bacterial load seems to increase with the time in transit of the milk.
