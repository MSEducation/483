The pyrocumulonimbus cloud (pyroCb) is a type of cumulonimbus cloud that forms above a source of heat, such as a wildfire, and may sometimes even extinguish the fire that formed it. It is the most extreme manifestation of a pyrocumulus cloud. According to the American Meteorological Society’s Glossary of Meteorology, a pyrocumulus is "a cumulus cloud formed by a rising thermal from a fire, or enhanced by buoyant plume emissions from an industrial combustion process."[tpl]cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?query=pyrocumulus|title=AMS Glossary|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=6 January 2012[/tpl] Analogous to the meteorological distinction between cumulus and cumulonimbus, the pyrocumulonimbus is a fire-aided or –caused convective cloud, like a pyrocumulus, but with considerable vertical development. The pyroCb reaches the upper troposphere or even lower stratosphere and may involve precipitation (although usually light), hail, lightning, extreme low-level winds, and in some cases even tornadoes.[tpl]cite doi|10.1029/2005GL025161[/tpl] The pyroCb was named following the discovery that extreme manifestations of this pyroconvection caused direct injection of large abundances of smoke into the lower stratosphere. [tpl]cite doi|10.1029/1999GL011200[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1029/2002GL016820[/tpl] A pyrocumulonimbus may often form from the eruption column of a volcano.
Alternate spellings and abbreviations for pyrocumulonimbus that may be found in the literature include pyro-cumulonimbus, pyro-cb, pyro-Cb and pyrocb. [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]  The World Meteorological Organization does not recognize the pyrocumulonimbus as a distinct cloud type, but instead classifies it simply as cumulonimbus.
In 2002, various sensing instruments detected 17 distinct pyrocumulonimbi in North America alone.Fire-Breathing Storm Systems

==2003 Canberra Firestorm==

On the 18 of January 2003, a supercell thunderstorm formed from a pyrocumulonimbus cloud[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] associated with a severe wildfire, during the 2003 Canberra bushfires in Canberra, Australia. The supercell resulted in a huge fire tornado, rated at EF3 on the fujita scale, the first confirmed violent fire tornado.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/3774941.htm |title=Fire Tornado |author=Anja Taylor |date=6 June 2013 |work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]better source needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] The tornado and associated fire killed 4 people and injured 492.
