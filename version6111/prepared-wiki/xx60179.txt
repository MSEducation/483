==Biblical usage==

===Egypt===

Rahab is a poetical name for Egypt. It might have Egyptian origins that were accommodated to the Hebrew language. However, there is nothing revealing in the Coptic language.
 ''I mention Rahab (Egypt) and Babel to those knowing Me, Lo, Philistia, and Tyre, with Cush! This one was born there.'' (Psalm [tpl]Bibleverse-nb||Psalm|87:4|YLT[/tpl])YLT
 Thou Jehovah art ruler over the pride of the sea, In the lifting up of its billows Thou dost restrain them. Thou hast bruised Rahab (Egypt), as one wounded. With the arm of Thy strength Thou hast scattered Thine enemies. ([tpl]Bibleverse||Psalm|89:8–10|YLT[/tpl])YLT 
 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah, Awake, as in days of old, generations of the ages, Art not Thou it that is hewing down Rahab (Egypt), Piercing a dragon! ([tpl]Bibleverse||Isaiah|51:9|YLT[/tpl])YLT 

==Rahaḇ as insolence or pride==

In Isaiah 30:7, rahaḇ (insolence, strength) becomes a proverbial expression that gives an allusion to the Hebrew etymology insolence.
 Yea, Egyptians are vanity, and in vain do help, Therefore I have cried concerning this: `Their strength (rahaḇ'') is to sit still.'' ([tpl]Bibleverse||Isaiah|30:7|YLT[/tpl])YLT
In the Book of Job, rahaḇ (pride, blusterer) occurs in the Hebrew text and is translated in the King James Version as "proud".
 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud (rahaḇ) helpers do stoop under him. ([tpl]Bibleverse||Job|9:13|KJV[/tpl])KJV 
 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud (rahaḇ). ([tpl]Bibleverse||Job|26:12|KJV[/tpl])KJV 

==Jewish folklore==

In mediaeval Jewish folklore, Rahab (noise, tumult, arrogance) is a mythical sea monster, a dragon of the waters, the "demonic angel of the sea". Rahab represents the primordial abyss, the water-dragon of darkness and chaos, comparable to Leviathan and Tiamat. Rahab later became a particular demon, inhabitant of the sea, especially associated with the Red Sea.
