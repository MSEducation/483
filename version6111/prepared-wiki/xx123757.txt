Botswana Railways (BR) is the national railway of Botswana.

==History==

BR was created in 1987 when the government of Botswana bought out the Botswana-based sections of the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jbic.go.jp/english/oec/post/1999/pdf/09.pdf|title=BR history[/tpl] NRZ had been initially operating the rail system after Botswana had gained independence.
Management of the BR is supported by RITES Ltd. of India.
The opening of the Beitbridge Bulawayo Railway in Zimbabwe in 1999 resulted in a major drop in the volume of freight transit and income. As a response the BR has been considering the construction of a direct line to Zambia (Zambia Railways), bypassing Zimbabwe, to regain income from transit.
On 27 February 2009, an announcement was made of the termination of all Botswana Railways passenger services.http://www.botswanarailways.co.bw/press/27feb09.html However, passenger trains run by National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) continue to run from Bulawayo to Lobatse via Plumtree, Francistown and Gaborone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railwaysafrica.com/2009/09/zim-botswana-passengers-drop/|title=ZIM-BOTSWANA PASSENGERS DROP|date=20 September 2009|publisher=Railways Africa|accessdate=2009-09-21[/tpl]
As of October 2010, BR was building a large shopping mall near Gaborone station, and expressed hopes that passenger services might resume, although BR could not give any concrete details.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2010/11/give-br-a-chance/|accessdate=2010-11-09|title=Give BR a chance | publisher = Railways Africa[/tpl]

==Network==

The Botswana Railways system consists of [tpl]convert|888|km[/tpl] of [tpl]RailGauge|1067mm[/tpl] Cape gauge track. The main line runs through the south-eastern region of Botswana from Mahikeng in South Africa through Lobatse, Gaborone, Mahalapye, Palapye and Francistown to Plumtree in Zimbabwe. In addition there are three branch lines: from Palapye to Morupule Colliery, from Serule to Selebi-Phikwe, and from Francistown to Sowa.

==Railway links to adjacent countries==

There is no direct connection with Namibia, but one does exist via South Africa, although an electrified railway connecting to Lüderitz, Namibia for coal traffic is/was scheduled to open in 2006.
In August 2010, Mozambique and Botswana signed a memorandum of understanding to develop an 1100 km railway through Zimbabwe, to carry coal from Serule in Botswana to a deep-water port at Techobanine Point in Mozambique.
A new rail link between Botswana and Zambia, bypassing Zimbabwe was mooted in 2005 by Botswana Railways (BR) general manager Andrew Lunga. The line was envisaged as running south-westwards from Livingstone, crossing the Zambesi, then continuing to a junction with the existing BR tracks at Mosetse.  Lunga's proposal arose following the serious loss of traffic suffered by BR following the opening of the Beitbridge-Bulawayo line, after which annual BR freight tonnage fell from 1.1m per annum to about 150,000.  Zimbabwe's economic problems had worsened the situation, prejudicing free traffic flow.  The suggested line, Lunga pointed out, would provide important alternative routes linking South Africa, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.RailwaysAfrica
