==History==

In November 2006, ICSTIS fined Eckoh Technologies (Babeworld's telephone network) £10,000, because the channel was running a sexually-explicit service during the daytime.PhonePayPlus[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl] Retrieved 31 March 2008 In November 2007, the channel was reproached and fined £25,000 by Ofcom for broadcasting sexually-explicit material at 9.15pm. The ruling said that "the content was so explicit, and in particular the language, it was considered to be 'adult-sex' material. This meant it should have been broadcast under encryption."The Guardian, “Babeworld fined after mum complains” Retrieved 31 March 2008 [tpl]cite news|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/770732/Babeworld-TV-fined-25000-serious-breaches/|title=Babeworld TV fined £25,000 for 'serious breaches'|last=McNally|first=Paul|date=30 November 2007|work=Brand Republic|accessdate=22 July 2010[/tpl]
On 24 October 2011, the channel had its broadcasting license revoked by Ofcom after the licensee, Babeworld TV Limited, failed to satisfy the regulator that it had general control over the service. Ofcom therefore concluded that Babeworld Television Limited was not the provider of the licensed services in accordance with section 362(2) of the Communications Act 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb192/obb192.pdf#page=5|title=Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin - Issue number 192|publisher=Ofcom|date=24 October 2011[/tpl] Both House of Fun and The Other Side had their licenses revoked at the same time, for the same reason.
