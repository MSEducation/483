The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is a U.S. light multiple rocket launcher mounted on a standard Army Medium Tactical Vehicle (MTV) truck frame.
The HIMARS carries six rockets or one Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missile on the U.S. Army's new Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) five-ton truck, and can launch the entire Multiple Launch Rocket System Family of Munitions (MFOM). HIMARS is interchangeable with the MLRS M270A1, carrying half the rocket load.
The launcher is C-130 transportable. The chassis is produced by BAE Systems Mobility & Protection Systems (formerly Armor Holdings Aerospace and Defense Group Tactical Vehicle Systems Division), the OEM of the FMTV.  The rocket launching system is produced by Lockheed Martin Missiles & Fire Control.

==Deployment==

The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) is the light, wheeled version of the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). The HIMARS utilizes the same pod as the M270 MLRS uses. A pod can hold six rockets or a single missile. 
18th Field Artillery Brigade (Airborne) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina was the initial army test bed unit for the M142 HIMARS. C Battery, 3rd Battalion, 27th Field Artillery Regiment began field testing 3 HIMARS prototypes in all types of training events and environments in 1998 as a residual of the Rapid Force Projection Initiative (RFPI) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD). In 2002, the United States Marine Corps arranged with the United States Army to acquire 40 of the systems.  Fielding began in 2005. In July 2007, Marines from Fox Battery 2nd Battalion 14 Marine Regiment were deployed to the Al Anbar province of Iraq. This is the first Marine unit to use the HIMARS in combat.
HIMARS was also tested as a common launcher for both artillery rockets and the surface-launched variant of the AMRAAM anti-aircraft missile.HIMARS Launcher Successfully Fires Air Defense Missile

===Singapore===

As of September 2007, the Singapore Army proposed to acquire HIMARS systems. The package includes 18 HIMARS launchers, 9 FMTV 5-Ton Trucks and XM31 unitary HE GMLRS pods, plus associated support and communications equipment and services. This proposed package is notable for not involving the M-26 unguided MLRS rockets. In late 2009, Singapore took delivery of the first HIMARS firing unit and achieved Full Operational Capability. The 23rd Battalion, Singapore artillery commissioned its HIMARS battery on 5 September 2011. It marks the first fully GPS-guided HIMARS unit.

==Operational history==

On February 14, 2010, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) for Afghanistan indicated in a press release that it was thought that two rockets fired from a HIMARS unit fell 300 metres short of their intended target and killed 12 civilians during Operation Moshtarak. ISAF suspended the use of the HIMARS until a full review of the incident was completed.ISAF Weapon Fails to Hit Intended Target, 12 Civilians Killed A British officer later said that the rockets were on target, that the target was in use by the Taliban, and use of the system has been reinstated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7254661/Operation-Moshtarak-missiles-that-killed-civilians-hit-correct-target.html |title=Operation Moshtarak: missiles that killed civilians 'hit correct target' |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-02-16 |accessdate=2010-07-07[/tpl]  Reports indicate that the civilian deaths were due to the Taliban's use of an occupied dwelling, the presence of civilians at that location was not known to the ISAF forces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htart/articles/20100218.aspx |title=Artillery: It Wasn't Me |publisher=Strategypage.com |date=2010-02-18 |accessdate=2010-07-07[/tpl] An October 21, 2010 report in the New York Times credited HIMARS with aiding the NATO offensive in Kandahar by targeting Taliban commanders' hideouts, forcing many to flee to Pakistan, at least temporarily.Coalition Forces Routing Taliban in Key Afghan Region

Lockheed Martin UK and INSYS had jointly developed a demonstrator rocket artillery system similar to HIMARS for the British Army's 'Lightweight Mobile Artillery Weapon System/Rocket' (LIMAWS(R)) program. The system consisted of a single MLRS pod, mounted on a Supacat SPV600 chassis.Missiles and Fire Support at DSEi 2007 The LIMAWS(R) programs was cancelled in September 2007.UK cancels LIMAWS Gun to pay for operations, Janes.com, 04 September 2007

The Department of National Defence is considering the purchase of HIMARS. The former Chief of the Land Staff, Lieutenant-General Andrew Leslie, said the plan to acquire rocket launchers was something that "would be considered much further down the road—possibly in the 2012 time frame.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.casr.ca/bg-artillery-lrprs-rocket-project.htm|title=CASR Background  — Artillery  —  Long-Range Precision Rocket System|date=|accessdate=2009-11-11|publisher=Canadian American Strategic Review[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090108/rocket_army_090108/20090108?hub=Canada|title=Canadian army shopping for rocket launchers|date=2009-01-08|accessdate=2009-11-11|publisher=CTV[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Canada-Seeks-MLRS-Rocket-Systems-05236/|title=Canada Seeks MLRS Rocket Systems|date=2009-01-07|accessdate=2009-11-11|publisher=Defense Industry Daily[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.casr.ca/doc-loi-lrprs-rocket.htm|title=Long Range Precision Rocket System (LRPRS)  –  A Multiple- Launch Rocket System – MERX LOI Letter of Interest Notice|date=|accessdate=2009-11-11|publisher=Canadian American Strategic Review[/tpl]
