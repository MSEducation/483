[[Warrungu language]]

CATEGORIES: Maric languages

Warrungu (or Warrangu, Warrango) is an Australian Aboriginal language, one of the dozen languages of the Maric branch of the Pamaâ€“Nyungan family. It was formerly spoken in the area around Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Its last native speaker was Alf Palmer, who died in 1981.
Before his death, linguists Tasaku Tsunoda and Dr. Peter Sutton worked together with Palmer to preserve the language (Warrungu proper); thanks to their efforts, the language is beginning to be revived.
One of the notable feature of the language is its syntactic ergativity.
