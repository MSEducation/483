==Publications and organizations==

===Z Magazine===

Z Magazine (formerly Zeta) was founded in 1987 by two of the co-founders of South End Press, Michael Albert and Lydia Sargent. It is an independent monthly magazine focusing on political, cultural, social, and economic life in the United States. It is published in print and on-line.  The print magazine is fifty pages (having been reduced in size during the summer of 2008), with articles of many lengths and focuses. The on-line magazine, updated monthly, reproduces the print as closely as possible and has two versionsâ€”one public (an archive), and the other for subscribers only. The latter appears simultaneously with the print version. The former appears a few months later.

Founded in 1995, Z Net is a large website updated many times daily to "convey information and provide community," generally focusing on politics from a left-wing perspective. It claims a readership of over a quarter of a million people a week, and features diverse "watch" context focus on hot-topic issues, sub-sites, translations, archives, links to other progressive sites, and a daily commentary program.
