The Mid-Michigan Destroyers were a franchise in the Premier Basketball League which began play in the 2009 season.  Based in Bay City, they trained at the JJKN Hoops Training Center (formerly the historic St. Joe's Gymnasium) but played at the Bay City Western high school gymnasium.[tpl]cite web | title = Mid-Michigan Destroyers Announce Coaching Staff, Draft Picks And Venue! | url = http://www.mybaycity.com/scripts/p3_v2/P3V2-0200.cfm?P3_NewspaperID=573&P3_articleID=3249 | last = Leveling | first = Marlo | date = 2008-11-24 | accessdate = 2008-12-15 | publisher = MyBayCity.com [/tpl]
The Destroyers tried to form strong rivalries with their fellow PBL teams in Michigan, the Detroit Panthers and the Battle Creek Knights, however two thirds of the way through their inaugural season, there was a split among the members of the ownership group and the team suspended operations for at least 2009, if not permanently.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.rnews.com/Sports/TopSports_2004.cfm?cmd=top&ID=69728&rnews_story_type=68&category=3 | title = PBL Loses Another Team | publisher = RNews.com | date = 2009-02-25 | last = Pucko | first = Bill | accessdate = 2009-02-25[/tpl]  The league also said the remaining Mid-Michigan games on the schedule would be filled by the remaining teams in the league.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3782345 | publisher = Our Sports Central | date = 2009-02-25 | accessdate = 2009-02-25 | title = PBL Grants Mid-Michigan a Suspension of Operations [/tpl]
