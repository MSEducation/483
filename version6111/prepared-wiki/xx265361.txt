==Description==

The sculpture is a large swirling abstract that consists of 8 bronze pieces painted black and placed on a pole. It moves freely.

==Information==

According to the artist the piece "began as an exploration of the MÃ¶bius strip, a product of pure mathematics formed by joining two ends of a strip of paper after giving one end a 180 degree twist, thus creating only one edge. The center of the bronze sculpture symbolizes a black hole, while the edge shows the flow of matter through the center from positive to negative space and back again in a continuum."[tpl]cite web | author=Charles O.

A similar sculpture exists, by Perry, called "Continuum II" which is installed Marina Square in Singapore and dates to 1986.[tpl]cite web | author= | year= | title=Continuum II | work=Singapore Public Art | publisher=Singapore Public Art | url=http://www.publicart.sg/?q=Charles-O-Perry_Continuum-II | accessdate= 2 January 2010[/tpl]

==Condition==

In July 2010 the piece underwent restoration to remove a green patina that formed on the sculpture. Perry's vision was for the piece to remain black. The piece was removed from its location to the west end of the building where it underwent its conservation by a contractor. The granite base that holds the 7,000 pound sculpture was also repaired.[tpl]cite web | author= | year=2010 | title=Continuum Sculpture Undergoes Restoration | work=AROUND NASM | publisher=National Air and Space Museum | url=http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs063/1101752115970/archive/1103512483603.html | accessdate= 3 January 2010[/tpl]
