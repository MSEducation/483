One gap junction channel is composed of two connexons

Gap junctions are expressed in virtually all tissues of the body, with the exception of adult fully developed skeletal muscle and mobile cell types such as sperm or erythrocytes.

==Structure==

In vertebrates, gap junction hemichannels are primarily homo- or hetero-hexamers of connexin proteins. Invertebrate gap junctions comprise proteins from the hypothetical innexin family. However, the recently characterized pannexin family, which was originally thought to form intercellular channels (based on similar amino acid sequence similarity to innexins), in fact functions as single-membrane channels that communicate with the extracellular environment, and have been shown to pass calcium and ATP.
At gap junctions, the intercellular space is 4 nm and unit connexons in the membrane of each cell are lined up with one another.[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=9514740 |year=1998 |first1=Guy A. |last1=Perkins |first2=Daniel A. |last2=Goodenough |first3=Gina E. |last3=Sosinsky |title=Formation of the gap junction intercellular channel requires a 30 degree rotation for interdigitating two apposing connexons |volume=277 |issue=2 |pages=171–7 |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |doi=10.1006/jmbi.1997.1580[/tpl]
Gap junction channels formed from two identical hemichannels are called homotypic, while those with differing hemichannels are heterotypic. In turn, hemichannels of uniform connexin composition are called homomeric, while those with differing connexins are heteromeric. Channel composition is thought to influence the function of gap junction channels.
In general, the genes coding for gap junction channels are classified in one of three groups, based on sequence similarity: A, B and C (for example, [tpl]Gene|GJA1[/tpl], [tpl]Gene|GJC1[/tpl]). However, genes do not code directly for the expression of gap junction channels; genes can produce only the proteins that make up gap junction channels (connexins). An alternative naming system based on this protein's molecular weight is also popular (for example: GJA1, GJB4).

To date, five different functions have been ascribed to gap junction protein:

==Occurrence and Distribution==

Gap Junctions have been observed in various animal organs and tissues where cells contact each other. From the 1950s to 1970s they were detected in crayfish nerves,[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 13037850 | volume=82 | issue=2 | title=Ultrastructure of two invertebrate synapses |date=February 1953 | pages=219–23 | last1 = Robertson | first1 = JD | journal = Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

By the 1990s new technology such as confocal microscopy allowed more rapid survey of large areas of tissue. Since the 1970s even tissues that were traditionally considered to possibly have isolated cells such as bone showed that the cells were still connected with gap junctions, however tenuously.[tpl]cite journal |author=Jones SJ, Gray C, Sakamaki H, et al. |title=The incidence and size of gap junctions between the bone cells in rat calvaria |journal=Anat.

Adult skeletal muscle is a possible exception. It may be argued that if present in skeletal muscle, gap junctions might propagate contractions in an arbitrary way among cells making up the muscle. At least in some cases this may not be the case as shown in other muscle types that do have gap junctions.[tpl]cite journal | pmid =   15679888 | doi=10.1186/1475-925X-4-7 | pmc=549032 | volume=4 | issue=1 | title=Gap-junction channels inhibit transverse propagation in cardiac muscle | year=2005 | journal=Biomed Eng Online | pages=7 | last1 =   Sperelakis | first1 =   Nicholas | last2 =   Ramasamy | first2 =   Lakshminarayanan[/tpl] An indication of what results from reduction or absence of gap junctions may be indicated by analysis of cancers[tpl]cite journal |author=Larsen WJ, Azarnia R, Loewenstein WR |title=Intercellular communication and tissue growth: IX.

==Functions==

The section "Areas of Electrical Coupling" reflects the circumstances of earliest discovery of gap junctions and their function in allowing the transmission of electrical impulses among cells at levels that elicit responses from their neighboring cells. The transmission of a nerve impulse and the contraction of muscle are relatively easily detected and quantified experimentally. "Areas of Electrical Coupling" also touches upon the retinal gap junctions, which could be seen as specialist nerve cells. Many new functions for gap junctions have been uncovered since those early years.

===Embryonic, Organ and Tissue Development===

In the 1980s, more subtle but no less important roles of gap junction communication have been investigated. It was discovered that gap junction communication could be disrupted by adding anti-connexin antibodies into embryonic cells.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 6088995 | volume=311 | issue=5982 | title=Antibodies to gap-junctional protein selectively disrupt junctional communication in the early amphibian embryo | year=1984 | journal=Nature | pages=127–31 | bibcode = 1984Natur.311..127W | author1 = Warner | first1 = Anne E. | last2 = Guthrie | first2 = Sarah C. | last3 = Gilula | first3 = Norton B. | doi = 10.1038/311127a0[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | pmid = 3030673 | volume=125 | title=The use of antibodies to gap junction protein to explore the role of gap junctional communication during development | year=1987 | journal=Ciba Found.

===Gap junctions and the "bystander effect"===

====Cell death====

The "bystander effect" with its connotations of the innocent bystander being killed is also mediated by gap junctions. When cells are compromised due to disease or injury and start to die messages are transmitted to neighboring cells connected to the dying cell by gap junctions.

====Tissue restructuring====

While there has been a tendency to focus on the bystander effect in disease due to the possibility of therapeutic avenues there is evidence that there is a more central role in normal development of tissues. Death of some cells and their surrounding matrix may be required for a tissue to reach its final configuration and gap junctions also appear essential to this process.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 12878681 | volume=23 | issue=16 | title=Gap junctions mediate bystander cell death in developing retina |date=July 2003 | journal=J.

===Areas of electrical coupling===

Gap junctions electrically and chemically couple cells throughout the body of most animals. Electrical coupling can be relatively fast acting. Tissues in this section have well known functions observed to be coordinated by gap junctions with inter-cellular signaling happening in time frames of micro-seconds or less.

====Heart====

Gap junctions are particularly important in cardiac muscle: the signal to contract is passed efficiently through gap junctions, allowing the heart muscle cells to contract in tandem. Gap junctions are expressed in virtually all tissues of the body, with the exception of adult fully developed skeletal muscle and mobile cell types such as sperm or erythrocytes. Several human genetic disorders are associated with mutations in gap junction genes. Many of those affect the skin because this tissue is heavily dependent upon gap junction communication for the regulation of differentiation and proliferation. Cardiac gap junctions can pharmacologically be opened with rotigaptide.

====Neurons====

A gap junction located in neurons is often referred to as an electrical synapse. The electrical synapse was discovered using electrical measurements before the gap junction structure was described. Electrical synapses are present throughout the central nervous system and have been studied specifically in the neocortex, hippocampus, vestibular nucleus, thalamic reticular nucleus, locus coeruleus, inferior olivary nucleus, mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, Ventral Tegmental Area, olfactory bulb, retina and spinal cord of vertebrates.Electrical synapses in the mammalian brain, Connors & Long, "Annu Rev Neurosci" 2004;27:393-418
There has been some observation of weak neuron to glial cell coupling in the locus coeruleus, and in the cerebellum between Purkinje neurons and Bergmann glial cells. It appears that astrocytes are coupled by gap junctions, both to other astrocytes and to oligodendrocytes.[tpl]cite journal|last=Orthmann-Murphy|first=Jennifer L.|coauthors=Abrams, Charles K.; Scherer, Steven S.|title=Gap Junctions Couple Astrocytes and Oligodendrocytes|journal=Journal of Molecular Neuroscience|date=May 2008|volume=35|issue=1|pages=101–116|doi=10.1007/s12031-007-9027-5|pmid=18236012|pmc=2650399[/tpl]  Moreover, mutations in the gap junction genes Cx43 and Cx56.6 cause white matter degeneration similar to that observed in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease and multiple sclerosis.
Connexin proteins expressed in neuronal gap junctions include:
with mRNAs for at least five other connexins (mCx26, mCx30.2, mCx32, mCx43, mCx47) detected but without immunocytochemical evidence for the corresponding protein within ultrastructurally-defined gap junctions.
Those mRNAs appear to be down-regulated or destroyed by micro interfering RNAs ( miRNAs ) that are cell-type and cell-lineage specific.

====Retina====

Neurons within the retina show extensive coupling, both within populations of one cell type, and between different cell types.

==Discovery==

===Where did the name come from?===

Gap junctions were so named because of the "gap" shown to be present at these special junctions between two cells.[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=2107199 |pmc=2107199 |year=1967 |first1=J.

Gap junctions are usually linear rather than annular in TEM thin sections. It is thought that annular gap junctions result from engulfment by one of the two cells of the membrane plaque to form a vesicle within the cell. This example shows three layers to the junction structure. The membrane from each cell is the dark line with the whiter narrow gap between the two darkly stained membranes. In such electron micrographs there may appear to be up to 7 layers. Two lipid mono-layers in each membrane can stain as 3 layers plus one layer from the gap between them, similar to two stacked bread sandwiches with space between them The term "gap junction" appeared to be coined about 16 years later circa 1969.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 5765759 | pmc=2107650 | volume=40 | issue=3 | title=Junctions between intimately apposed cell membranes in the vertebrate brain |date=March 1969 | journal=J.

===Form and indicator of function===

Well before the demonstration of the "gap" in gap junctions they were seen at the junction of neighboring nerve cells. The close proximity of the neighboring cell membranes at the gap junction lead researchers to speculate that they had a role in intercellular communication, in particular the transmission of electrical signals.[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=13037850 |year=1953 |first1=J.

Implicit or explicit in most of the early studies is that the area of the gap junction was different in structure to the surrounding membranes in a way that made it look different. The gap junction had been shown to create a micro-environment between the two cells in the extra-cellular space or "gap". This portion of extra-cellular space was somewhat isolated from the surrounding space and also bridged by what we now call connexon pairs which form even more tightly sealed bridges that cross the gap junction gap between two cells. When viewed in the plane of the membrane by freeze-fracture techniques, higher-resolution distribution of connexons within the gap junction plaque is possible.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 4935338 | doi=10.1083/jcb.47.1.49 | pmc=2108397 | volume=47 | issue=1 | title=An interpretation of liver cell membrane and junction structure based on observation of freeze-fracture replicas of both sides of the fracture |date=October 1970 | journal=J.

Connexin free islands are observed in some junctions. The observation was largely without explanation until vesicles were shown by Peracchia using TEM thin sections to be systematically associated with gap junction plaques.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 4120610 | pmc=2108965 | volume=57 | issue=1 | title=Low resistance junctions in crayfish.

Studies showing vesicles associated with gap junctions and proposing the vesicle contents may move across the junction plaques between two cells were rare, as most studies focused on the connexons rather than vesicles. A later study using a combination of microscopy techniques confirmed the early evidence of a probable function for gap junctions in intercellular vesicle transfer. Areas of vesicle transfer were associated with connexin free islands within gap junction plaques.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=12972275 | doi=10.1016/S1065-6995(03)00140-9 | volume=27 | issue=9 | title=Are gap junction membrane plaques implicated in intercellular vesicle transfer? | year=2003 | journal=Cell Biol.

===Gap junctions and the electrical and chemical nerve synapses===

Because of the widespread occurrence of gap junctions in cell types other than nerve cells the term gap junction became more generally used than terms such as electrical synapse or nexus. Another dimension in the relationship between nerve cells and gap junctions was revealed by studying chemical synapse formation and gap junction presence. By tracing nerve development in leeches with gap junction expression suppressed it was shown that the bidirectional gap junction (electrical nerve synapse) needs to form between two cells before they can grow to form a unidirectional "chemical nerve synapse".[tpl]cite journal |author=Todd KL, Kristan WB, French KA |title=Gap junction expression is required for normal chemical synapse formation |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=30 |issue=45 |pages=15277–85 |date=November 2010 |pmid=21068332 |pmc=3478946 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2331-10.2010 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=21068332[/tpl] The chemical nerve synapse is the synapse most often truncated to the more ambiguous term "nerve synapse".

Ultrastructure and biochemistry of isolated gap junctions already referenced had indicated the connexins preferentially group in gap junction plaques or domains and connexins were the best characterized constituent. It has been noted that the organisation of proteins into arrays with a gap junction plaque may be significant.[tpl]cite journal |author=Staehelin LA |title=Three types of gap junctions interconnecting intestinal epithelial cells visualized by freeze-etching |journal=Proc.

Combining the emerging fields of freeze-fracture to see inside membranes and immunocytochemistry to label cell components (Freeze-fracture replica immunolabelling or FRIL and thin section immunolabelling) showed gap junction plaques in vivo contained the connexin protein.[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=3818793 |year=1987 |author1=Gruijters |first1=WTM |first2=J |first3=S |first4=DA |title=Immunolocalization of MP70 in lens fiber 16-17-nm intercellular junctions |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=565–72 |pmc=2114558 |journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |doi=10.1083/jcb.104.3.565 |last2=Kistler |last3=Bullivant |last4=Goodenough[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|pmid=3448099 |url=http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/88/3/351 |journal=Journal of Cell Science |title=Formation, distribution and dissociation of intercellular junctions in the lens |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=351–9 |author=Gruijters, WTM |first2=J |first3=S |year=1987 |last2=Kistler |last3=Bullivant[/tpl] Later studies using immunofluorescence microscopy of larger areas of tissue clarified diversity in earlier results. Gap junction plaques were confirmed to have variable composition being home to connexon and non-connexin proteins as well making the modern usage of the terms "gap junction" and "gap junction plaque" non-interchangeable.[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=2691517 |url=http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/93/3/509 |journal=Journal of Cell Science |title=A non-connexon protein (MIP) is involved in eye lens gap-junction formation |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=509–13 |author=Gruijters, WTM |year=1989[/tpl] In other words, the commonly used term "gap junction" always refers to a structure that contains connexins while a gap junction plaque may also contain other structural features that will define it.

====The "plaque" or "formation plaque"====

Early descriptions of "gap junctions" and "connexons" did not refer to them as such and many other terms were used. It is likely that "synaptic disks"[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 14069795 | pmc=2106854 | volume=19 | title=The occurrence of a subunit pattern in the unit membranes of club endings in mauthner cell synapses in goldfish brains |date=October 1963 | journal=J. Cell Biol. | pages=201–21 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.19.1.201 | last1 = Robertson | first1 = JD | issue = 1[/tpl] were an accurate reference to gap junction plaques. While the detailed structure and function of the connexon was described in a limited way at the time the gross "disk" structure was relatively large and easily seen by various TEM techniques. Disks allowed researchers using TEM to easily locate the connexons contained within the disk like patches in vivo and in vitro. The disk or "plaque" appeared to have structural properties different from those imparted by the connexons alone.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 4109925 | pmc=2108629 | volume=52 | issue=2 | title=The structural organization of the septate and gap junctions of Hydra |date=February 1972 | journal=J.

Later studies showed gap junction plaques are home to non-connexin proteins making the modern usage of the terms "gap junction" and "gap junction plaque" non-interchangeable as the area of the gap junction plaque may contain proteins other than connexins.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1065-6995(03)00140-9 |title=Are gap junction membrane plaques implicated in intercellular vesicle transfer? |year=2003 |last1=Gruijters |first1=WTM |journal=Cell Biology International |volume=27 |pages=711–7 |pmid=12972275 |issue=9[/tpl] Just as connexins do not always occupy the entire area of the plaque the other components described in the literature may be only long term or short term residents.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ozato-Sakurai N, Fujita A, Fujimoto T |title=The distribution of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in acinar cells of rat pancreas revealed with the freeze-fracture replica labeling method |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=e23567 |year=2011 |pmid=21858170 |pmc=3156236 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023567 |editor1-last=Wong |editor1-first=Nai Sum[/tpl]
