[[Raunkiær plant life-form]]

CATEGORIES: Plant life-form, Botanical nomenclature, Ecology, Plants, Botany

The Raunkiær system is a system for categorizing plants using life-form categories, devised by Christen C. Raunkiær.

==History==

It was first proposed in a talk to the Danish Botanical Society in 1904 and briefly described in the society's journal Botanisk Tidsskrift.Raunkiær, C. (1904) Om biologiske Typer, med Hensyn til Planternes Tilpasninger til at overleve ugunstige Aarstider. Botanisk Tidsskrift 26, p. XIV.Ch. 1 in Raunkiær (1934): Biological types with reference to the adaption of plants to survive the unfavourable season, p. 1. 
A fuller account appeared in French the following year.Raunkiær, C. (1905) Types biologiques pour la géographie botanique. Oversigt over Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskabs Forhandlinger, 1905, 347-438. Raunkiær elaborated further on the system and published this in Danish in 1907.Raunkiær, C. (1907) Planterigets Livsformer og deres Betydning for Geografien. Gyldendalske Boghandel - Nordisk Forlag, København and Kristiania. 132 pp.Ch. 2 in Raunkiær (1934): The life-forms of plants and their bearings on geography, p. 2-104. 
The original note and the 1907 paper were much later translated to English and published with Raunkiær's collected works.Raunkiær, C. (1934) The Life Forms of Plants and Statistical Plant Geography, being the collected papers of C. Raunkiær. Oxford University Press, Oxford. Reprinted 1978 (ed. by Frank N. Egerton), Ayer Co Pub., in the "History of Ecology Series". ISBN 0-405-10418-9

==Modernization==

Raunkiær's life-form scheme has subsequently been revised and modified by various authors,Müller-Dombois, D. & H. Ellenberg (1974) Aims and methoods in vegetation ecology. John Wiley & Sons, New York. Reprint 2003, Blackburn Press, ISBN 1-930665-73-3Shimwell, D.W. (1971) The Description and Classification of Vegetation. Sidgwick & Jackson, London. but the main structure has survived.
