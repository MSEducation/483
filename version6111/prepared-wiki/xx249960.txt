The following is a timeline of the presidency of John F. Kennedy, also known as the Kennedy Administration, which began January 20, 1961 when he was inaugurated President of the United States, and ended when he was assassinated on November 22, 1963, a span of 1,036 days.  This timeline begins on January 2, 1960, the date when then Senator John F. Kennedy announced his intention to run for the Democratic presidential nomination and concludes on November 25, 1963, when the martyred president was buried.  Kennedy was the first Catholic President, the youngest elected President (Theodore Roosevelt, who succeeded to the Presidency after William McKinley's assassination, was younger), and the fourth President to be assassinated.
Upon Kennedy's death, in accordance with Constitutional procedure in the case of the death of the President, his Vice President, Lyndon B. Johnson, succeeded to the Office of the Presidency and took the oath of office of the President of the United States aboard Air Force One less than an hour after Kennedy died. Johnson served out the remainder of Kennedy's term, and was elected to the Presidency in his own right in 1964.
