Outrider is an album by Jimmy Page, released by Geffen Records on 19 June 1988. It is his first solo studio album and the first time since 1969 he has recorded with a record label other than Atlantic Records/Swan Song Records. Page recorded the music at his personal studio The Sol. Robert Plant guests on one track, "The Only One", while John Bonham's son Jason drums with Page for the first time on record.
This was originally intended to be a two album release. However, during the early recording stages of this album, Page's house was broken into and amongst the items stolen were the demo tapes which had been recorded up to that point.Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press, p. 166. Page didn't record any demos prior to recording the album itself.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/jimmy-page-discusses-his-new-solo-album-outrider-and-more-1988-guitar-world-interview-part-1?page=0,3 |title=Jimmy Page Discusses His New Solo Album, 'Outrider,' and More in 1988 Guitar World Interview, Part 1 (Page 3) |publisher=Harris Publications |work=Guitar World |last1=Kay |first1=Max |last2=Scoppa |first2=Bud |date=2011-09-19 |accessdate=2012-09-17[/tpl]
