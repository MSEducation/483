Normally the term refers to the mainland communities around the bay and excludes Galveston as well as most of Houston.
Originally part of the pirate kingdom of Jean Lafitte, this area played a role in the early history of Texas having been the site of some early rebellions against Mexican rule and the site of the victory of the Texas army over the Mexican army during the Texas Revolution. Ranching interests became early economic drivers around the bay. As the nearby cities of Galveston and Houston developed as commercial centers, the Bay Area communities became part of a principal commercial corridor between the cities.
The Bay Area is also the location of NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center which houses the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center.  The City of Houston's official nickname as "Space City" is derived from this.  In addition, a large tourist attraction for area visitors is Space Center Houston.
The landscape around the bay features a mix of swamps, beaches, industrial facilities, tourist attractions, and historic sites. The area's developing population is ethnically diverse with a growing international community. The communities host cultural events ranging from ballet and musical theater to fairs and rodeos. The bay itself supports a commercial fishing industry and features one of the highest concentrations of marinas in the nation. On land the area holds numerous historic sites such as the San Jacinto Monument, and many parks and nature preserves such as the Armand Bayou Nature Center.

==Boundaries==

The shores of Galveston Bay are home to many different municipalities and communities. The region is part of the larger Houston–Sugar Land–Baytown Metropolitan Area. Though the term Bay Area in its broadest sense refers to all communities near the shoreline, some sources, such as the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership (BAHEP), use more limited definitions, often referring more specifically to the clusters of communities nearest to Houston.Galveston Bay Estuary Program (2002), Ch. 3 [tpl]cite book | title=Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership: nine cities, two counties, one region | author=Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership | publisher=Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership | url=http://books.google.com/?id=5m69PgAACAAJ | date=200?[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.newcomerstexas.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=179&Itemid=196 | title=Bay Area | publisher=First Books | accessdate=14 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bayareahouston.com/Home/DataCenter/Demographics/ | title=City Data Profiles | publisher=Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership | accessdate=24 September 2009|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080617061756/http://www.bayareahouston.com/Home/DataCenter/Demographics/ |archivedate = 17 June 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]Chang (2006), p. 185.[tpl]cite web | url=http://tourismprod.baytown.org/History/Bay+Area+Historical+Society.htm | publisher=|title=Historical Society, Baytown | accessdate=8 September 2009[/tpl] [tpl]cite news | title=Electricity should be restored to city | work=Baytown Sun | date=1 October 2005 | url=http://baytownsun.com/story/23118/[/tpl]

===Municipalities===

The following communities lie on the shores of Galveston Bay proper and Trinity Bay, the two main components of the Galveston Bay complex (excluding those along the Gulf of Mexico):
The BAHEP and the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce (CLACC) include the following additional communities in their membership:
Some additional communities such as La Marque, adjacent to Texas City, are treated as bayside communities by some sources.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chron.com/neighborhoods/clearlake/events.html?SearchSection=clearlake&community=Clear%20Lake | publisher=Houston Chronicle| title=Clear Lake-Bay Area | accessdate=19 January 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Subdivisions===

The Bay Area can be sub-divided based on the histories and economic connections of the different communities.

==History==

===Spain, Mexico, and the Republic of Texas===

Prior to European settlement the area around Galveston Bay was settled by the Karankawa and Atakapan tribes, who lived throughout the Gulf coast region. Spanish explorers such as the Rivas-Iriarte expedition and José Antonio de Evia charted the bay and gave it its name.[tpl]Handbook of Texas | id=EE/uzeuj | name=Exploration | author=Morris, John Miller | retrieved=14 November 2009[/tpl] Texas State Historical Association. [tpl]Handbook of Texas | name=Galveston County | id=GG/hcg2 | author=Kleiner, Diana J. | retrieved=14 November 2009[/tpl] Texas State Historical Association. In 1816 the pirate Louis-Michel Aury established a settlement on Galveston Island but was soon succeeded by the pirate Jean Lafitte. Lafitte transformed Galveston and the bay into a pirate kingdom establishing bases and hide-outs at locations such as Trinity Bay, Clear Lake, and Eagle Point.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.co.chambers.tx.us/fortanahuac/ana4~23~02.pdf | title=Fort Anahuac Visitors Center | publisher=Chambers County | accessdate=21 December 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Handbook of Texas | id=SS/hls12 | name=San Leon, Texas | author=Gard, Leigh | retrieved=22 December 2009[/tpl] Chang (2006), p. 187. Kearney (2008), p. 177. In 1821, however, the United States Navy ousted Lafitte and the colony was largely abandoned.[tpl]Handbook of Texas | name=Laffite, Jean | id=LL/fla12 | author=Warren, Harris Gaylord | retrieved=14 November 2009[/tpl] Texas State Historical Association.
Following its declaration of independence from Spain the new nation of Mexico moved to colonize its northern territory of Texas by offering land grants to settlers both from within Mexico and from the nearby United States.[tpl]Handbook of Texas | id=AA/fau14 | name=Austin, Stephen Fuller | author=Barker, Eugene C. | retrieved=14 November 2009[/tpl] Texas State Historical Association. Small settlements such as Lynchburg and San Jacinto were gradually established around the bay and in 1830 Mexican authorities created a customs and garrison post at Anahuac commanded by Juan Davis Bradburn.Galveston Bay Estuary Program (2002), p. 27. Henson (1982), p. 49. Henson (1982), p. 51. Galveston Bay Estuary Program (2002), p. 27–28. Conflicts between Bradburn and the settlers in the region led to the Anahuac Disturbances, a prelude to the larger Texas rebellion that was to come. Following a coup in the Mexican government many freedoms previously enjoyed by the Texans were revoked causing Texas to revolt and declare its independence in 1835. After a number of battles the Texas army, under the leadership of General Sam Houston, finally defeated the Mexican Army in the Battle of San Jacinto, near modern Pasadena.[tpl]Handbook of Texas | name=Battle of San Jacinto | id=SS/qes4 | author=Kemp, L. W. | retrieved=14 November 2009[/tpl] Texas State Historical Association.
The new Republic of Texas grew rapidly. The shores of the bay were initially mostly home to farms and ranches such as the famed Allen Ranch.[tpl]Handbook of Texas | name=Allen Ranch | id=AA/apa1 | author=Pomeroy, C. David, Jr. | retrieved=16 October 2009[/tpl] Texas State Historical Association. New communities such as Goose Creek (modern Baytown) were established.[tpl]Handbook of Texas | name=Goose Creek, Texas| id=GG/hvg32 | retrieved=16 October 2009 | author=Benham, Priscilla Myers[/tpl] Texas State Historical Association.

===U.S. annexation===

Texas succeeded in its bid to join the United States in 1845 which helped launch the Mexican-American War. Texas' annexation brought more people to Texas and ranching interests around the bay began to grow. Throughout the 19th century Galveston remained Texas' dominant metropolis and the communities around the bay were strongly tied economically and culturally to the city though, as Houston began to develop, so did the Bay Area's ties to it. The construction of the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad further spurred growth in the area.[tpl]Handbook of Texas | id=DD/hfd3 | name=Dickinson, Texas | author=Rocap, Pember W. | retrieved=14 November 2009[/tpl] Texas State Historical Association.
During the American Civil War, during which Texas seceded from the United States, the area served a limited role in the conflict as new fortifications like Fort Chambers, near Anahuac, were constructed to ward off a mainland invasion by Union forces and to protect supply routes to and from Galveston. The Bay Area sat in the middle of the conflict as the most important battles in Texas occurred at Galveston with the conflict moving through the area on to Harrisburg and Houston after Galveston's fall.Johnston (1991), pp. 61–68.
In the aftermath of the war the Texas economy declined for a period. Nevertheless ranching interests became major economic drivers in the area spawning many other economic enterprises such as hide processing plants and shipping concerns. The success of these enterprises and the growth of Galveston as one of the prime commercial centers in the South and Southwest helped promote the construction of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway; and the La Porte, Houston and Northern Railroad through the area over the course of the 19th century. These railroads running along the southwest shore of the bay would spawn new communities such as Clear Creek (League City), Webster, and later Texas City.[ref][tpl]Handbook of Texas | id=LL/hel6 | name=League City, Texas | author=Kleiner, Diana J. | retrieved=14 November 2009[/tpl] Texas State History Association.

[tpl]Handbook of Texas | id=WW/hjw4 | name=Webster, Texas | author=Kleiner, Diana J. | retrieved=14 November 2009[/tpl] Texas State History Association.[/ref] Some of these new communities would develop initially as stop-over points for travelers on the rail lines. Toward the end of the century, as ranching's profitability declined, many communities turned increasingly to agriculture. The farming community of Pasadena was established during this time.
The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 devastated the city of Galveston and heavily damaged communities around the bay (according to some estimates the Bay Area death toll may have been as high as 2000).[tpl]cite web|title=Weather Events: The 1900 Galveston Hurricane|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/events/1900hurr.htm|publisher=The Weather Doctor|accessdate=12 September 2009[/tpl] Bridges between Galveston and the mainland were destroyed.Munsart (1997), p. 119. Communities along the shoreline declined for some time as economic growth moved inland and Houston became the dominant economic center in the region. The region received a population boost from some Galveston refugees who relocated to the mainland following the catastrophe.[tpl]cite web | title=Pasadena Texas - History | url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Pasadena_Texas_-_History/id/5366471 | publisher=Global Oneness | accessdate=12 September 2009 | quote=The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 caused many people to resettle in Pasadena.[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=Our City: The Birthplace of Free Texas | publisher=City of Pasadena|url=http://www.ci.pasadena.tx.us/ourcity.htm | accessdate=12 September 2009|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080619165609/http://www.ci.pasadena.tx.us/ourcity.htm |archivedate = 19 June 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

===20th century===

The sparsely populated Bay Area transformed during the 20th century. Following the hurricane, donations by the newly established Red Cross helped revive area farming communities.[tpl]Handbook of Texas | id=PP/hdp2 | name=Pasadena, Texas | author=Pomeroy, C. David, Jr. | retrieved=14 November 2009[/tpl] Texas State History Association.

After the war area economic diversification brought on by the war effort helped in the transition to a peacetime economy. NASA's Johnson Space Center was established in 1963 helping to spur explosive growth in the mid 20th century, especially the 1970s and 80s. The remainder of the communities on the southwestern shore urbanized and development connected the area to Houston.[tpl]Handbook of Texas | id=CC/hjc23 | name=Clear Lake City Texas, Texas | author=Greene, Casey Edward | retrieved=14 November 2009[/tpl] Texas State Historical Association.

==Geography==

The Galveston Bay Area is located on the gulf coastal plain, and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and marshes. The municipalities have been built on reclaimed marshes, swamps, and prairies, which are all still visible in undeveloped areas.[ref]Blackburn (2004), p. 40.
"The acreage of swamps and bottomlands ... found in the Galveston Bay system ... is about 36,000 acres..."

Eubanks (2006), p. 10.

[/ref] Flatness of the local terrain and proximity to the Bay and the Gulf have made flooding a recurring problem for the area.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.crwr.utexas.edu/gis/gishyd98/class/trmproj/ahrens/prepro.htm | title=Flood Forecasting for the Buffalo Bayou Using CRWR-PrePro and HEC-HMS | publisher=Center for Research in Water Resources, The University of Texas at Austin | accessdate=10 January 2007[/tpl] The region once relied on groundwater for its needs, but land subsidence has forced much of the region to turn to ground-level water sources.[tpl]cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/circ1182/pdf/07Houston.pdf | format=pdf | title=Houston-Galveston, Texas: Managing Coastal Subsidence | publisher=United States Geological Survey | accessdate=11 January 2007[/tpl]

===Geology===

The land beneath the Bay Area consists of layers of sand and clay to great depths. These layers were created by millennia of river-borne sediments which gradually incorporated plant and animal matter creating the petroleum deposits for which the Gulf Coast is known.[tpl]cite web | author=Vipulanandan, C. | url=http://cigmat.cive.uh.edu/CIGMAT%20Conference/CIGMAT-08/Present%2008/C.Vipu.pdf | title=Geotechnical Engineering Challengers in the Houston Area | publisher=CIGMAT-2008 Conference & Exhibition | year=2008[/tpl]
The region has numerous faults, many considered active, but none has produced significant earthquakes in recorded history.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/eq/faq/tx.htm | title=Texas Earthquakes | publisher=University of Texas Institute for Geophysics |date=July 2001 | accessdate=29 August 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070715065340/http%3A//www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/eq/faq/tx.htm |archivedate = 15 July 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] These faults tend to move at a smooth rate in what is termed fault creep, which reduces the risk of an earthquake.

===Bay and coastline===

Galveston Bay is an estuary along the Texas Gulf Coast.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gbep.state.tx.us/about-galveston-bay/geography.asp | title=About Galveston Bay: Geography | publisher=Galveston Bay Estuary Program | accessdate=3 September 2009[/tpl] The bay as a whole is composed of four major sub-bays: Galveston Bay proper, Trinity Bay, East Bay, and West Bay.Melosi (2007), p. 12. Other smaller bays and lakes connecting to this complex of waterways in the Bay Area include San Jacinto Bay, Burnet Bay, Scott Bay, Crystal Bay, Goose Lake, Clear Lake, Dickinson Bay, and Moses Lake.[tpl]cite web | url=http://gbic.tamug.edu/gbeppubs/T3/gbnepT3_97-109.pdf | publisher=Galveston Bay Information Center (Texas A&M Univ.) | title=Regional Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program - Galveston Bay 1993 | page=100 | accessdate=14 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=City of Baytown: Flood Mitigation Plan | author=City of Baytown Floodplain Mitigation Planning Committee | publisher=City of Baytown, Texas | page=34 | date=29 November 2005[/tpl]
Galveston Bay is mostly shallow with an average depth of 7–9 feet. It is fed by the Trinity River and the San Jacinto River, numerous local bayous and incoming tides from the Gulf of Mexico. This unique and complex mixing of waters from different sources supports many types of marine life including crabs, shrimp, oysters, and many varieties of fish thereby supporting a substantial fishing industry. Additionally the system of bayous, rivers, and marshes that ring the Bay support their own ecosystems allowing for diverse wildlife and enabling freshwater farming of crawfish.[tpl]Cite web | title = Rural areas east of Houston become crawfish havens | work = News 8 Austin | accessdate = 5 September 2009| url = http://www.news8austin.com/content/headlines/?ArID=73980&SecID=2[/tpl] The areas near the bay shore in fact have a higher diversity of habitats than the nearby Gulf coast.[tpl]cite book | title=Finding Birds On The Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail: Houston, Galveston, and the Upper Texas Coast | author=Eubanks, Ted Lee, Jr.; Behrstock, Robert A.; Davidson, Seth | publisher=Texas A&M University Press | location=College Station, TX | isbn=978-1-58544-534-9 | year=2008 | page=155 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=1Q3ikuupgGgC[/tpl]

===Climate===

The Bay Area's climate is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa in Köppen climate classification system). Spring supercell thunderstorms sometimes create tornados (but not to the extent found in tornado alley).[tpl]cite book | title=USA business: the portable encyclopedia for doing business with the United States| author=Shippey, Karla C. | url=http://books.google.com/?id=EHLUyBTpPxgC | publisher=World Trade Press | year=1995 | page=203 | isbn=1-885073-01-1[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hgx/severe/swa/tornadoes.htm | title=Houston/Galveston, Texas | publisher=NOAA: National Weather Service Forecast Office | accessdate=18 September 2009[/tpl] Prevailing winds from the south and southeast bring heat from the deserts of Mexico and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.[ref]

==Economy==

The Bay Area has a diverse economy with much of it built around aerospace, petrochemicals, and high tech industries.[tpl]cite web | title=Office Space Skyrocketing in Bay Area Houston | url=http://bayareahouston.com/Home/PressRoom/HotoffthePress1/BayAreaHoustonOfficeSp/ | publisher=Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership|date=2 October 2003[/tpl] Chang (2006), p. 185.[tpl]cite web | url=http://bayareahouston.org/Home/TargetIndustries/ | title=Target Industries | publisher=Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership | accessdate=3 September 2009|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080518031235/http://bayareahouston.org/Home/TargetIndustries/ |archivedate = 18 May 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The region's economy is closely tied to the rest of the Houston area though the mix of local businesses is somewhat unique.

===Overview===

The Bay Area's four major employment sectors are aerospace, petrochemicals and chemical processing, high-tech (software, biotechnology, electronics, etc.), and tourism.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bayareahouston.com/DATA/Home/DataCenter/RegionalStudies/BayAreaHoustonOverview/Bay%20Area%20Houston%20Overview.PDF | title=Bay Area Houston: Overview | date=June 2007 | publisher=Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership[/tpl] [tpl]dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot[/tpl]  Most other employment in the region is supported by these industries although some smaller, independent industries exist as well.
The most widespread economic activities in the area revolve around petroleum and petrochemicals, largely centered in Baytown, Pasadena/La Porte, and Texas City. These industries in Houston and the Bay Area account for nearly half of the U.S. petrochemical manufacturing[tpl]cite news | author=Casselman, Ben | title=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124407051124382899.html | title=Planning the 'Ike Dike' Defense | work=Wall Street Journal | date=4 June 2009[/tpl] and approximately one third of the U.S. petroleum refining capacity.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.texaswideopenforbusiness.com/assets/documents/petro-chem/Petroleum-Chemicals-Overview.pdf | title=Petroleum Refining & Chemical Products | publisher=Office of the Texas Governor, Economic Development and Tourism Division | date=Jan 2009[/tpl] The Bay Area is home to the largest refineries and petrochemical complexes in the Greater Houston area and to the majority of the processing capacity.Lewis (2006), pp. 304–305.

Home to a diverse set of communities, the Bay Area has a demographic distribution that varies greatly among these individual communities. Based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the City of Houston (2008, where available, and 2000 otherwise), the area demographic statistics are as follows (see table for more details). The total population was approximately 566,850. The median household income was $56,827. The white population was 72.9%, the African American population was 8.3%, and the Asian population was 3.9%.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.houstontx.gov/planning/Demographics/demograph_docs/demo_index.htm | title=Index - Census 2000 Data By Super Neighborhoods | publisher=City of Houston | accessdate=3 November 2009[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url=http://factfinder.census.gov | title=U.S Census Bureau: American Factfinder | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate=3 November 2009[/tpl]
The most populous community in the region is Pasadena (though Houston is a much larger city, the portion within this region is smaller than Pasadena). Taylor Lake Village has (by far) the highest median household income; and Bacliff and San Leon have the lowest. Texas City and La Marque have the largest African-American populations. La Porte and the Clear Lake area of Houston have the largest Asian populations.

==Education==

===Colleges and universities===

The Bay Area contains several institutions of higher education.[ref]Chang (2006), pp. 182, 188.

[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bayareahouston.com/Home/DataCenter/Education/HigherEducation/ | title=Higher Education | publisher=Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership | accessdate=21 September 2009[/tpl][/ref] The largest is the University of Houston–Clear Lake (UHCL) located adjacent to Clear Lake City. UHCL is separate and distinct from the University of Houston (UH), but it is part of the larger University of Houston System. The university offers a wide spectrum of programs including what it touts as the most complete biotechnology graduate programs in the state.[tpl]cite web | title=Biotechnology Program | publisher=University of Houston-Clear Lake | url=http://prtl.uhcl.edu/portal/page/portal/SCE/Natural_Sciences/BIOTECHNOLOGY | accessdate=22 September 2009 | quote=The University of Houston-Clear Lake is the first university in Texas to offer all three concentrations for an Master of Science in Biotechnology: Molecular Biotechnology, Bioinformatics & Computational Biology, and Biotechnology Management & Marketing[/tpl]
Texas Chiropractic College in Pasadena, one of only two schools of chiropractics in Texas and one of a handful in the nation, provides training for students from around the state.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chiropracticschools.com/ | title=Directory of Chiropractic Schools in the United States | publisher=All Schools.com (Monster.com) | accessdate=14 November 2009|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822103942/http://www.chiropracticschools.com/ |archivedate = 22 August 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Several community colleges serve communities in the area as well, including San Jacinto College, College of the Mainland, Lee College, and Houston Community College.Peterson's (2007), p. 53.

===Primary and secondary schools===

The Bay Area covers multiple municipalities with multiple school districts. Most of the communities in the Clear Lake Area are served by Clear Creek Independent School District though some nearby areas are served by Dickinson and Houston Independent School Districts. Communities in the Pasadena/Baytown area are served by Deer Park, Goose Creek Consolidated, La Porte, and Pasadena Independent School Districts. The Friendswood area is served by the Friendswood Independent School District. The Texas City area is served by La Marque and Texas City Independent School Districts. The communities in Chambers County near Anahuac are served by Anahuac Independent School District and Barbers Hill Independent School District.Chang (2006), pp. 182, 185, 188, 193.
[tpl]As of|2009[/tpl] these 11 districts, excluding Houston ISD, have a total of 190 primary and secondary schools. Of these Clear Creek, Deer Park, Goose Creek, Barbers Hill and Anahuac ISD were evaluated as "recognized" districts (the second highest ranking) by the Texas Education Agency, or TEA. All of the others were evaluated as "academically acceptable" with the exception of Texas City ISD, which was evaluated as "academically unacceptable".[tpl]cite web | url=http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/account/2009/districtlist.srch.html | publisher=Texas Education Agency | title=2009 Accountability System: List by District | accessdate=22 January 2010[/tpl]
67 (35%) of the schools were ranked as "exemplary" (the highest ranking); 62 (33%) were ranked as "recognized"; 39 (21%) were ranked as "academically acceptable"; 2 (1%) were ranked as "academically unacceptable"; and 20 (11%) were not rated by the TEA. Notably 100% of Friendswood ISD schools and 65% of Clear Creek ISD schools were "exemplary", the highest percentages of these 10 districts. Overall, of the schools that were rated, 37% of the schools in these 10 districts were "exemplary", compared with 29% for the entire state.[tpl]cite web | url=http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/account/2009/statesummary.html | title=2009 Accountability System: State Summary | publisher=Texas Education Agency | accessdate=22 January 2010[/tpl]

==Transportation==

The Bay Area Houston Transportation Partnership (BayTran) coordinates planning for the transportation needs of the Bay Area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.batp.org|title=Bay Area Houston Transportation Partnership[/tpl] Collaborative efforts by the local communities have helped push forward development of regional infrastructure.

===Ground transportation===

The Bay Area's two interstate freeways act as linear backbones connecting the communities on either side of the ship channel. The few other freeways in the region provide access into the centers of heavy industry within the region. Connectivity within other communities mostly relies on uncontrolled, surface highways.
Interstate 45 (the Gulf Freeway) is the major freeway for the core areas of the Bay Area linking them with Houston and Galveston.Melosi (2007), p. 168–169. Highway 146 (Bayport Blvd.) is a coastal highway linking the waterfronts of the communities. The Gulf Freeway and Bayport Blvd. together are the main arteries linking the Clear Lake Area communities and Pasadena, though Highway 225, East Beltway 8, Highway 3 and others are important as well.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/images/areamap.pdf | title=Map of Bay Area Houston | publisher=Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership | accessdate=11 January 2010[/tpl] The Fred Hartman Bridge on Highway 146 crosses the ship channel connecting Baytown and Pasadena, while the Galveston Causeway on the Gulf Freeway crosses the bay connecting Texas City and Galveston Island.[tpl]cite web | url=http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0000555 | title=Fred Hartman Bridge | publisher=Nicolas Janberg/Structurae | accessdate=11 January 2010[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url=http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0003653 | title=Galveston Causeway Bridge | publisher=Nicolas Janberg/Structurae | accessdate=11 January 2010[/tpl]
In the outlying north Bay Area, Interstate 10 links Anahuac and other communities nearby connecting them to Houston and the rest of the Bay Area. Highway 124 provides access to the Bolivar Peninsula.
The Houston Metro bus system provides service to the southeast Houston and Pasadena connecting the communities with central Houston.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ridemetro.org/SchedulesMaps/SysMaps.aspx | title=Overall System Map | publisher=Harris County Metropolitan Transit Authority | accessdate=11 January 2010[/tpl]  The remaining communities in the Bay Area communities are not served by mass transit. Greyhound Bus Lines, which provides service to cities nationwide, has stations at Baytown and La Marque/Texas City.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.greyhound.com/scripts/en/TicketCenter/terminal.asp?city=688567 | title=Baytown, Texas | publisher=Greyhound Bus Lines | accessdate=11 January 2010[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.greyhound.com/scripts/en/TicketCenter/terminal.asp?city=682935 | title=La Marque Texas City, Texas | publisher=Greyhound Bus Lines | accessdate=11 January 2010[/tpl]

===Air travel===

Houston Hobby Airport (HOU) is the nearest airport providing regular domestic service. It is in southeast Houston near the Bay Area and provides service to U.S. destinations. International service is provided by Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in north Houston.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fly2houston.com/aboutHAS | title=Houston Airport System | publisher=Houston Airport System | accessdate=11 January 2010[/tpl]
Ellington Airport, the other branch of the Houston Airport System (HAS), is a mixed-use airport. It acts as a reliever airport for Hobby, in addition to use by NASA, the military, and public aviation.[ref]
