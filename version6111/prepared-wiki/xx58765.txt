[[Cough medicine]]

CATEGORIES: Antitussives

A cough medicine or cough and cold medicine, also known as linctus when in syrup form, is a medicinal drug used in those with coughing and related conditions. There is no good evidence for or against the use of over-the-counter cough medications in those with a cough.[tpl]cite journal|last=Smith|first=SM|coauthors=Schroeder, K; Fahey, T|title=Over-the-counter (OTC) medications for acute cough in children and adults in ambulatory settings.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Aug 15, 2012|volume=8|pages=CD001831|pmid=22895922|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001831.pub4[/tpl] While they are used by 10% of American children weekly, they are not recommended in Canada and the United States in children 6 years or younger because of lack of evidence showing effect and concerns of harm.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/content/full/55/11/1081 |title=Use of over-the-counter cough and cold medications in children|first2=RD|last2=Goldman|author=Shefrin and Goldman|volume=55|issue=11|date=November 2009|pages=1081–1083|journal=Canadian Family Physician |pmid=19910592|pmc=2776795[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/10/19/coldmed.fda/index.html|title=FDA panel: No cold medicines to children under 6|work=CNN|accessdate=2009-11-27|location=Washington[/tpl]

==Effectiveness==

The efficacy of cough medication is questionable, particularly in children.Medsafe cough and cold grouphttp://www.medsafe.govt.nz/hot/alerts/CoughandCold/Minutes2CoughandCold.asp A 2012 Cochrane review concluded that "There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough".

Honey's use as a cough treatment has been linked on several occasions to infantile botulism and as such should not be used in children less than one year old.[tpl]Cite journal|authors=Sung, Valerie; Cranswick, Noel |title=Cough and cold remedies for children |journal=Australian Prescriber |issue=32 |pages=122–4 |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/32/5/122/4/ |accessdate=27 August 2010[/tpl]
Many alternative treatments are used to treat the common cold. However, a 2007 review states that, "Complementary and alternative therapies (i.e., Echinacea, vitamin C, and zinc) are not recommended for treating common cold symptoms; however, ... Vitamin C prophylaxis may modestly reduce the duration and severity of the common cold in the general population and may reduce the incidence of the illness in persons exposed to physical and environmental stresses."[tpl]Cite journal|author=Simasek M, Blandino DA |title=Treatment of the common cold |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=515–20 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17323712 |doi= |url=[/tpl]
A 2009 review found that the evidence supporting the effectiveness of zinc is mixed with respect to cough, and a 2011 Cochrane review concluded that zinc "administered within 24 hours of onset of symptoms reduces the duration and severity of the common cold in healthy people".[tpl]cite journal |author=Singh M, Das RR |title=Zinc for the common cold |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD001364 |year=2011 |pmid=21328251 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001364.pub3[/tpl] A 2003 review concluded: "Clinical trial data support the value of zinc in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms of the common cold when administered within 24 hours of the onset of common cold symptoms."[tpl]Cite journal|author=Hulisz D |title=Efficacy of zinc against common cold viruses: an overview |journal=J Am Pharm Assoc (2003) |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=594–603 |year=2004 |pmid=15496046 |doi= 10.1331/1544-3191.44.5.594.Hulisz|url=[/tpl] Nasally applied zinc gel may lead to long-term or permanent loss of smell.

While a number of plants and Chinese herbs have been purported to ease cold symptoms, including ginger, garlic, hyssop, mullein, and others, studies have either not been done or have been found inconclusive.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Linde K, Barrett B, Wölkart K, Bauer R, Melchart D |title=Echinacea for preventing and treating the common cold |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD000530 |year=2006 |pmid=16437427 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000530.pub2 |url=|editor1-last=Linde|editor1-first=Klaus[/tpl]

===Poisoning===

According to the New York Times, at least eight mass poisonings have occurred as a result of counterfeit cough syrup, substituting inexpensive diethylene glycol in place of glycerin. In May 2007, 365 deaths were reported in Panama, which were associated with cough syrup containing diethylene glycol.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/world/06poison.html | work=The New York Times | title=From China to Panama, a Trail of Poisoned Medicine | first1=Walt | last1=Bogdanich | first2=Jake | last2=Hooker | date=2007-05-06 |accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl]
