==Plot==

Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis) is planning to marry the respectable May Welland (Winona Ryder). May's American cousin, the Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) has returned to New York which causes a shock in society circles. The Countess unwisely married a Polish Count and the Count took her fortune and mistreated her and she left him to return to New York.
May's family is boldly and publicly standing by the Countess in the face of malicious gossip, and Archer admires it. Archer prematurely announces his engagement to May, but as he comes to know the Countess, he begins to appreciate her unconventional views on New York society and he becomes increasingly disillusioned with his new fianceé May and her innocence, lack of personal opinion, and sense of self.
After the Countess announces her intention of divorcing her husband, Archer supports her desire for freedom, but he feels compelled to act on behalf of the family and persuade the Countess to remain married. When Archer realizes that he is in love with the Countess, he abruptly leaves the next day to be reunited with May and her parents who are in Florida on vacation. Archer asks May to shorten their engagement, but May becomes suspicious and asks him if his hurry to get married is prompted by the fear that he is marrying the wrong person. Archer reassures May that he is in love with her. When back in New York, Archer calls on the Countess and admits that he is in love with her, but a telegram arrives from May announcing that her parents have pushed forward the wedding date.
After their wedding and honeymoon, Archer and May settle down to married life in New York. Over time, Archer's memory of the Countess fades. When the Countess returns to New York to care for her grandmother (Miriam Margolyes), she and Archer agree to consummate their affair. But then suddenly, the Countess announces her intention to return to Europe. May throws a farewell party for the Countess, and after the guests leave, May announces to Archer that she is pregnant and that she told Ellen her news two weeks earlier.
The years pass: Archer is 57 and has been a dutiful, loving father, and a faithful husband. The Archers have had three children. When May died of infectious pneumonia, he had honestly mourned her. Archer's son, Ted (Robert Sean Leonard) convinces him to travel to France. There, Ted has arranged to visit the Countess Olenska at her Paris apartment. Archer has not seen her in over 25 years. Ted confides to his father May's deathbed confession that "... she knew we were safe with you, and always would be. Because once, when she asked you to, you gave up the thing you wanted most." Archer confesses that she never asked him. That evening outside the Countess' apartment, Archer sends his son alone to visit her. While sitting outside the apartment, he thinks about their time together and gets up and walks away.

The Age of Innocence was filmed on location primarily in Troy, New York, various parks in New York City, and in Paris, France. The opera scenes were filmed at the Philadelphia Academy of Music in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The scenes set in the home of Mrs. Mingott were filmed in "The Castle", a fraternity house belonging to the Alpha Tau chapter of Pi Kappa Phi at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Vincent Canby in The New York Times wrote: "Taking The Age of Innocence, Edith Wharton's sad and elegantly funny novel about New York's highest society in the 1870s, Martin Scorsese has made a gorgeously uncharacteristic Scorsese film...The film is the work of one of America's handful of master craftsmen."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/17/movies/review-film-the-age-of-innocence-grand-passions-and-good-manners.html?pagewanted=all |first=Vincent |last=Canby |title=Review/Film: The Age of Innocence; Grand Passions and Good Manners |work=The New York Times |date=September 17, 1993[/tpl]
Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: "The story told here is brutal and bloody, the story of a man's passion crushed, his heart defeated. Yet it is also much more, and the last scene of the film, which pulls everything together, is almost unbearably poignant."[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19930917/REVIEWS/309170301/1023 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |title=The Age of Innocence :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=September 17, 1993[/tpl]
Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote: "A superlative cast catches Wharton's urgency. Ryder, at her loveliest, finds the guile in the girlish May – she'll use any ruse that will help her hold on to Archer. Day-Lewis is smashing as the man caught between his emotions and the social ethic. Not since Olivier in Wuthering Heights has an actor matched piercing intelligence with such imposing good looks and physical grace. Pfeiffer gives the performance of a lifetime as the outcast countess."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947143/review/5947144/the_age_of_innocence |first=Peter |last=Travers |title=The Age of Innocence : Review: Rolling Stone |work=Rolling Stone |date=September 16, 1993[/tpl]
Desson Howe in the Washington Post wrote: "There's an alert, thinking presence behind the camera. And, in front of the camera, performers Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder suffuse this saga of repressed longing and spiritual suffering with elegant authority.... Known primarily for modern street pictures, such as Taxi Driver and GoodFellas, Scorsese shows he can flex an entirely different set of muscles and still make a great movie.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/theageofinnocencepghowe_a0aff3.htm |first=Desson |last=Howe |title='The Age of Innocence' (PG) |work=The Washington Post |date=September 17, 1993[/tpl]
Todd McCarthy in Variety wrote: "For sophisticated viewers with a taste for literary adaptations and visits to the past, there is a great deal here to savor....Day-Lewis cuts an impressive figure as Newland... The two principal female roles are superbly filled.... Scorsese brings great energy to what could have been a very static story, although his style is more restrained and less elaborate than usual."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117901187.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |first=Todd |last=McCarthy |title=The Age of Innocence Review |work=Variety |accessdate=2009-11-18 | date=August 31, 1993[/tpl]
Rita Kempley, also in the Washington Post, wrote: "Perhaps it shouldn't come as such a grand surprise that he Scorsese is as deft at exploring the nuances of Edwardian manners as he is the laws of modern-day machismo."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/theageofinnocencepgkempley_a0a3b3.htm |first=Rita |last=Kempley |title='The Age of Innocence' (PG) |work=The Washington Post |date=September 17, 1993[/tpl]
Time Out wrote: "The performances are excellent, while the director employs all the tools of his trade to bring his characters and situations vividly to life... Scorsese's most poignantly moving film."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/77600/the_age_of_innocence.html |title=The Age of Innocence Review – Film – Time Out London |publisher=timeout.com |accessdate=2009-11-18[/tpl]
But not all the critics had positive remarks. Marc Savlov in the Austin Chronicle wrote: "At two hours and 13 minutes, Scorsese has allowed himself enough time to follow Wharton's book to the letter, and also enough time to include long stretches of painfully wearisome society functions and banter. As a period piece, it's a joy to behold, but with such an indecisive little newt of a protagonist, it's just hard to give a damn what happens."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A139057 |first=Marc |last=Savlov |title=Film Listings |work=Austin Chronicle |date=September 24, 1993[/tpl]
