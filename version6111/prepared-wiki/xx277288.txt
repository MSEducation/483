The Assault on Danzig or Battle of Kiezmark was a battle during the Polish–Swedish War of 1626–1629.
On May 25, 1627 the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus, who in 1626 had taken a sconce at Weichsel, near Danzig, attacked from there with 1200 men under the command of the Count of Thurn and Johan Banér. The attack was prematurely discovered by the enemy and the Swedes have to retreat, suffering losses. During the retreat, the Swedish king got hit by a bullet in the abdomen that almost killed him.
In another attack on 4 July the Swedes occupied Danziger Werder.
