===Vedas===

The predecessors of the flying vimanas of the Sanskrit epics are the flying chariots employed by various gods in the Vedas: the Sun (see Sun chariot) and Indra and several other Vedic deities are transported by flying wheeled chariots depicted to be pulled by animals, usually horses.
The existing Rigveda versions do not mention Vimanas, but verses RV 1.164.47-48 have been taken as evidence for the idea of "mechanical birds":
In Swami Dayananda Saraswati's "translation", these verses mean:
although the 'wheel' is likeliest a metaphorical description of the yearly cycle[tpl]OR|date=November 2013[/tpl], and '12' and the '360' are likeliest its months and days.[tpl]Dubious|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===Ramayana===

In the Ramayana, the pushpaka ("flowery") vimana of Ravana is described as follows:
It is the first flying vimana mentioned in existing Hindu mythology texts (as distinct from the gods' flying horse-drawn chariots).
Pushpaka was originally made by Vishwakarma for Brahma, the Hindu god of creation; later Brahma gave it to Kubera, the God of wealth; but it was later stolen, along with Lanka, by his half-brother, king Ravana.

===Mahabharata===

One example in the Mahabharata is that the Asura Maya had a Vimana measuring twelve cubits in circumference, with four strong wheels.http://www.crystalinks.com/vimanas.html

==Vimanas and the Vaimānika Shāstra==

The Vaimānika Shāstra is an early 20th-century Sanskrit text on aeronautics, obtained allegedly by mental channeling, about the construction of vimānas, the "chariots of the Gods".
The existence of the text was revealed in 1952 by G. R. Josyer, according to whom it is due to one Pandit Subbaraya Shastry, who dictated it in 1918–1923. A Hindi translation was published in 1959, the Sanskrit text with an English translation in 1973. It has 3000 shlokas in 8 chapters  and was attributed by Shastry to Maharishi Bharadvaja,Childress (1991), p. 109 which makes it of purportedly "ancient" origin, and hence it has a certain notability in ancient astronaut theories.
A study by aeronautical and mechanical engineering at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 1974 concluded that the aircraft described in the text were "poor concoctions" and that the author showed complete lack of understanding of aeronautics.[tpl]cite news|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120331170834/http://www.hvk.org/articles/0601/100.html|title=Flights of fancy?
