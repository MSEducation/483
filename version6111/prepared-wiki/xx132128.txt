[[The Tamlins]]

CATEGORIES: Jamaican reggae musical groups

The Tamlins are a 1970s Jamaican reggae and dub vocal group. Composed of Carlton Smith, Junior Moore, and Derrick Lara, The Tamlins are among the most recognized back-up singers in reggae, especially for their years of international touring in support of Peter Tosh. They have also backed John Holt, Delroy Wilson, Pat Kelly, and Marcia Griffiths, among others, as well as recording on their own. Having released one unsuccessful album in 1976, they came to prominence in the late 1970s by releasing 12" singles in Jamaica for Channel One Studios, usually covering earlier rocksteady hits such as "Hard to Confess".
They gained wider attention for their Sly and Robbie produced version of the Randy Newman song, "Baltimore" (1979). The arrangement on that single was notably similar to that used on Nina Simone's cover of the song, released less than a year earlier.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] They also cut "Go Away Dream" for the same producers, while vocalist Lara enjoyed some solo success in the early 1980s.
