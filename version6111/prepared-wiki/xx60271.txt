==Life and career==

Branco served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2000 to 2001. He was Minister of Public Works in July 2003, when he was detained by the military during a briefly successful coup d'etat led by Major Fernando Pereira.
After Prime Minister Patrice Trovoada was defeated in a May 2008 vote of no confidence proposed by the MLSTP/PSD, which was then in opposition, President Fradique de Menezes asked the MLSTP/PSD to form a government in June 2008, and it chose Branco to become the next Prime Minister. Trovoada's Independent Democratic Action (ADI) party denounced Menezes' designation of the MLSTP/PSD to form a government as unconstitutional."Partido de PM destituído contra nomeação de novo Governo são-tomense", Panapress, June 16, 2008 [tpl]pt icon[/tpl].
