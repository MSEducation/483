==About==

In early July, Converge's official website announced the title of the album, as well as the meaning behind it:

==Reception==

No Heroes was given 8.1/10 by Brandon Stosuy of Pitchfork Media as he said "Conceptually reminiscent of the way Orthrelm's OV rocked socks within a tight framework, No Heroes is one of the year's most musically cohesive ways to keep pulses beating rapidly."
Sam Roudman of Stylus Magazine gave the album a B+ by stating "As Converge have been instrumental in the expansion of the contemporary hardcore vocabulary—embracing music signifiers previously under the dominion of metal or grind—this return to roots makes this album something of a homecoming."
Notably, No Heroes received a 4.5 out of 5[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/9709/Converge-No-Heroes/ |title=Converge - No Heroes (staff review) |publisher=Sputnikmusic |accessdate=2012-03-03[/tpl] from Sputnikmusic staff reviewer Jared W. Dillon, commenting that "No Heroes is completely successful in delivering a great array of extremely heavy music", while another staff reviewer, Nick Butler, gave the album 1.5 out of 5,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/10498/Converge-No-Heroes/ |title=Converge - No Heroes (staff review) |publisher=Sputnikmusic |date=2006-12-28 |accessdate=2012-03-03[/tpl] commenting that "I'll undoubtedly get flamed to hell for this, but if No Heroes isn't the worst album I've heard in 2006, it's certainly the least enjoyable", making it one of the uncommon instances where two staff reviewers almost completely disagree with each other.
