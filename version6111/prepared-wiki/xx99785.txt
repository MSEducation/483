[[Cuban peso]]

CATEGORIES: Economy of Cuba, 1857 introductions

The peso (ISO 4217 code: CUP, sometimes called the "national peso" or in Spanish moneda nacional) is one of two official currencies in use in Cuba, the other being the convertible peso (ISO 4217 code: CUC, occasionally referred to as "dollar" in spoken language). It is subdivided into 100 centavos.
Cuban state workers receive a portion of their wages in convertible pesos, the rest in national pesos. Shops selling basics, like fruit and vegetables, generally accept only the normal peso, while "dollar shops" sell the rest. The word "pesos" may refer to both non-convertible and convertible money. Cuban convertible pesos are 25 times more valuable, but this does not completely eliminate the confusion for tourists: since goods bought in national pesos have controlled prices, tourists are sometimes confused by prices perceived as "too cheap."

==History==

Before 1857, Spanish and Spanish colonial reales circulated in Cuba. From 1857, banknotes were issued specifically for use on Cuba. These were denominated in pesos, with 1 peso = 8 reales. From 1869, notes were also issued denominated in centavos, with 100 centavos = 1 peso. In 1881, the peso was pegged to the U.S. dollar at par. The currency continued to be issued only in paper form until 1915, when the first coins were issued.
In 1960, the peg to the dollar was replaced by one to the Soviet ruble. The peso lost value due to the United States embargo against Cuba and the suspension of the sugar quota. This suspension was the principal economical force driving Cuba to seek out a new economic partner, the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, the peso lost much of its value and the exchange rate fell to 125 pesos to the US dollar. Recently, it has become more valuable, fluctuating between 23 and 25 pesos to the US dollar.
In 1993, during the period of economic austerity known as the Special Period, the US dollar was made legal tender to encourage hard currency to enter the economy. The US dollar became the currency used to purchase some non-essential goods and services, such as cosmetics, and even non-staple kinds of food and drink. In 1994, the convertible peso was introduced at a par with the dollar. On November 8, 2004, the Cuban government withdrew the US dollar from circulation, citing the need to retaliate against further US sanctions.

==Coins==

In 1897 and 1898 pesos were issued by revolutionary forces promoting independence.The Story Behind the 1897 Cuban Peso and the 1898 Peso  In 1915, cupro-nickel 1, 2 and 5 centavos, silver 10, 20 and 40 centavos and 1 peso, and gold 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 20 peso coins were introduced. These coins were designed by Charles E. Barber, who also designed the Barber dimes, quarters, half dollars for the US. The coins were minted at the US mint at Philadelphia. The gold coins and 2 centavos were not produced after 1916, with the large star design 1 peso ceasing production in 1934.
