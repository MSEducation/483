</ref>  Up to seven (7) RL10 engines would be used in the proposed Jupiter Upper Stage, serving an equivalent role to the [[Ares V]] [[Earth Departure Stage]].

==Future use of the RL10==

Several potential uses of enhanced versions of the RL10 engine have been proposed:

===Manned lunar missions===

In 2005 NASA announced the decision to use an Apollo-like spacecraft configuration for the proposed Orion spacecraft. At that time NASA decided that the descent stage of the new Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) would be powered by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The original plan called for the ascent stage to use liquid methane and liquid oxygen, but that has changed[tpl]when|date=March 2011[/tpl] and the ascent stage will now also use LH2/LOX.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
Because of the choice of propellents, along with the need to land the spacecraft in the polar regions of the Moon from an equatorial orbit, NASA decided to use the RL10 as the main powerplant for the descent stage engine.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] Current specifications call for four RL10 engines to be used on the descent stage and a single RL10 for the ascent stage.  Currently, the RL10B-2 engines used on the Delta III and Delta IV can thrust at 20% of maximum thrust[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl].  Because of the need for the LSAM to hover above the lunar surface, along with providing a smooth landing, the new RL10 engines must be able to thrust as low as 10%.  The use of the RL10 will allow NASA to keep costs on the lunar program down by using existing hardware, albeit modified to enhance performance or allow for manned spaceflight.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]

===Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine===

The Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine (CECE) is a testbed to develop RL10 engines that throttle well. NASA has contracted with Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne to develop the CECE demonstrator engine.[ref]

Chugging was eliminated by injector and propellant feed system modifications that control the pressure, temperature and flow of propellants.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/jan/HQ_09-005_Cryo_engine_test.html |title=NASA Tests Engine Technology for Landing Astronauts on the Moon |date=Jan 14, 2009 |publisher=NASA[/tpl]

===Advanced Common Evolved Stage===

[tpl]asof|2009[/tpl], an enhanced version of the RL10 rocket engine was proposed to power the upper-stage versions of the Advanced Common Evolved Stage (ACES), a long-duration, low-boiloff extension of existing ULA Centaur and Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS) technology.[tpl]cite journal |last=Kutter|first=Bernard F. |coauthors=Frank Zegler, Jon Barr, Tim Bulk, Brian Pitchford |title=Robust Lunar Exploration Using an Efficient Lunar Lander Derived from Existing Upper Stages |journal=AIAA |year=2009 |url=https://info.aiaa.org/tac/SMG/STTC/White%20Papers/DualThrustAxisLander(DTAL)2009.pdf |ref=AIAA 2009-6566[/tpl]  Long-duration ACES technology is explicitly designed to support geosynchronous,  cislunar, and interplanetary missions as well as provide in-space propellant depots in LEO or at [tpl]L2[/tpl] that could be used as way-stations for other rockets to stop and refuel on the way to beyond-LEO or interplanetary missions.  Additional missions could include the provision of the high-energy technical capacity for the cleanup of space debris.[ref]

===NextGen Propulsion Study===

NASA is partnering with the US Air Force (USAF) to study next-generation upper stage propulsion, formalizing the agencies joint interests in a new upper stage engine to replace the venerable Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne RL-10.
"We know the list price on an RL-10.  If you look at cost over time, a very large portion of the unit cost of the EELVs is attributable to the propulsion systems, and the RL-10 is a very old engine, and there's a lot of craftwork associated with its manufacture," says Dale Thomas, associate director of technical issues at NASA Marshall. "That's what this study will figure out, is it worthwhile to build an RL-10 replacement?"
From the study, NASA hopes to find a less expensive RL-10-class engine for a third stage of the Space Launch System (SLS), which is on track to become the most powerful rocket ever built. Atop the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME)-powered first stage and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne J-2X second stage, a third stage is required to push massive payloads beyond Earth orbit.
USAF hopes to replace the Rocketdyne RL-10 engines used on the upper stage of both the Lockheed Martin Atlas V and the Boeing Delta IV, known as evolved expendable launch vehicles (EELV) that are the primary method of putting US satellites into space. While NASA frequently uses EELVs to launch large scientific payloads, the programme's administration is largely run through other channels.[tpl]cite web|last=Roseberg|first=Zach|title=NASA, US Air Force to study joint rocket engine|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/nasa-us-air-force-to-study-joint-rocket-engine-370660/ |publisher=Flight Global|accessdate=June 1, 2012|date=April 12, 2012[/tpl]
In 2003, Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne had 90% of the work completed for the new RL-60 replacement of the RL-10.[tpl]cite press|title=Pratt & Whitney's RL60 Moves Closer to Completion|publisher=Pratt & Whitney|date= April 22, 2003|accessdate=June 1, 2012|url=http://www.pw.utc.com/media_center/press_releases/2003/04_apr/4-22-2003_4912521.asp |[/tpl]
The RL60 cryogenic upper stage engine is designed to produce 60,000 pounds of thrust with a specific impulse of [tpl]convert|465|isp[/tpl] to meet the evolving needs of expendable launch requirements or human-rated missions.
The RL60 was to be built and tested domestically with key components to be provided by four international industry strategic suppliers; Volvo Aero of Sweden  (Regen cooled nozzle), Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) of Japan (Fuel Turbopump), Techspace Aero of Belgium (Fuel Inlet and LOX control valve) and Chemical Automatics Design Bureau (CADB) of Russia (LOX Turbopump).
