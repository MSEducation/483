Larkhall Thistle F.C. are a football club from Larkhall, in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. Formed in 1878 the Jags are Scotland's oldest Junior Football Club and currently compete in the SJFA Central Division One. They play in red and white stripes and their home ground since 1881 is Gasworks Park. The club had planned to relocate to a purpose built stadium in the Hareleeshill area in conjunction with a Tesco supermarket development.Second supermarket for Larkhall South Lanarkshire Council, 24 May 2011, Retrieved 30 June 2011. That agreement ended when rival supermarket Asda were given planning permission to build a store in Larkhall, ending Tesco's hopes for a town store of their own. This has put Larkhall's stadium plans, and future, in doubt.Supermarket War Ends As Tesco Shelve Plans To Build New Store In Larkhall Hamilton Advertiser, 26 January 2012, Retrieved 30 January 2013.
