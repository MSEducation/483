==Description==

The yoroidōshi is an extra thick tantō (Japanese dagger-like sword) which appeared in the Sengoku period (late Muromachi).The Japanese sword, Kanzan Satō, Kodansha International, 1983 P.30 The yoroidōshi was made for piercing armourSecrets of the samurai: a survey of the martial arts of feudal Japan Oscar Ratti, Adele Westbrook p.260 and for stabbing while grappling in close quarters.  The weapon ranged in size from 20 cm to 22 cm, but some examples could be under 15 cm, with a "tapering mihaba, iori-mune, thick kasane at the bottom, and thin kasane at the top and occasionally moroha-zukuri construction".The connoisseur's book of Japanese swords, Author Kōkan Nagayama, Publisher Kodansha International, 1998, ISBN 4-7700-2071-6, ISBN 978-4-7700-2071-0 P.30 The motogasane (blade thickness) at the hamachi (the notch at the beginning of the cutting edge) can be up to a half-inch thick, which is characteristic of the yoroidōshi style of tantō.  The extra thickness at the spine of the blade distinguishes the yoroidōshi from a standard tantō blade.
