The Columbia area was once part of the Mississippian culture and home to the Mound Builders. When European explorers arrived, the area was populated by the Osage and Missouri Indians. In 1678, La Salle claimed all of Missouri for France. The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed by the area on the Missouri River in early June 1804. In 1806, two sons of Daniel Boone established a salt lick [tpl]nowrap|[tpl]convert|40|mi|km|0[/tpl][/tpl] northwest of Columbia. giving the area its early name:  Boonslick. The Boone's Lick Trail wound from St. Charles to the lick in present day Howard County. In 1818, a group of settlers, incorporated under the Smithton Land Company, purchased over [tpl]convert|2000|acre|km2[/tpl] and established the village of Smithton less than a mile from current day downtown Columbia. In 1821, the settlers moved, because of lack of water, across the Flat Branch to the plateau between the Flat Branch and Hinkson creeks in what is now the downtown district. They renamed the settlement Columbia—a poetic personification of the United States.
The roots of Columbia's three economic foundations—education, medicine, and insurance—can be traced back to incorporation in 1821.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.columbia.k12.mo.us/columbia/colhis.htm | title=History of Columbia | work=Columbia Public Schools | accessdate=January 1, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.columbiaredi.com/pdfs/ColumbiaKudos.pdf |format=PDF| title= Columbia Kudos | work=Columbia Regional Economic Development (REDI) | accessdate=January 1, 2008[/tpl] Original plans for the town set aside land for a state university. In 1833, Columbia Baptist Female College opened, which later became Stephens College. Columbia College (distinct from today's), later to become the University of Missouri, was founded in 1839. When the state legislature decided to establish a state university, Columbia raised three times as much money as any other competing city[tpl]cite book | last =Switzler | first=William | title=History of Boone County, Missouri | publisher=St. Louis Western Historical Company |year=1882 | pages=300–310[/tpl] and James S. Rollins donated the land that is today the Francis Quadrangle. Soon other educational institutions were founded in Columbia such as Christian Female College, the first college for women west of the Mississippi, which later became the current Columbia College. The city benefited from being a stagecoach stop of the Santa Fe and Oregon trails, and later from the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. In 1822 the first hospital was set up by William Jewell. In 1830, the first newspaper began; in 1832, the first theater in the state was opened; and in 1835, the state's first agricultural fair was held. By 1839, the population (13,000) and wealth of Boone County was exceeded in Missouri only by that of St. Louis County, which at that time included the City of St. Louis.[tpl]cite book | last =Switzler | first=William | title=History of Boone County, Missouri | publisher=St. Louis Western Historical Company |year=1882 | pages=325–327[/tpl]
Columbia's infrastructure was relatively untouched by the Civil War. Missouri, as a slave state, had Southern sympathies, but remained in the union. The majority of the city was pro-union, however, the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-slavery. Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which union troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence of union troop dissuaded the confederate guerrillas from attacking, though several major battles occurred nearby at Boonville and Centralia. After the Civil War, race relations in Columbia followed the Southern pattern. In 1889, the city witnessed the lynching of an African American man, George Burke.[tpl]cite book | last =NAACP | title=Thirty Years of Lynching in the United States, 1889–1918 | publisher=NAACP |year=1919 | pages=80[/tpl]
In 1963, Columbia become home to the headquarters of both the University of Missouri System, which today serves over 71,000 students,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/about/history/| title=History of the University | work=University of Missouri System | accessdate=July 18, 2008[/tpl] and the Columbia College system, which today serves about 25,000 students.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ccis.edu/about/ | title=Welcome to Columbia College | work=Columbia College | accessdate=July 18, 2008[/tpl] The insurance industry also became important to the local economy as several companies established headquarters in Columbia, including Shelter Insurance, Missouri Employers Mutual, and Columbia Insurance Group. State Farm Insurance has a regional office in Columbia. In addition, the now defunct Silvey Insurance was once a large local employer. Columbia became a transportation crossroads when U.S. Route 63 and U.S. Route 40 (which became present-day Interstate 70) were routed through the city. Soon after the city opened the Columbia Regional Airport. The latter 20th century saw tremendous growth, and by 2000 the population was nearly 85,000 in the city proper.
In early 2006, Columbia embarked on a plan[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gocolumbiamo.com/Public_Comm/Visioning/visioning_overview.php | title=Imagine Columbia's Future Visioning Overview | work=City of Columbia | accessdate=January 1, 2008[/tpl] to manage the continued growth as the passed 100,000 population. The city continues to grow, especially East around the newly opened Battle High School. The downtown district has maintained its status as a cultural center and is undergoing significant development in both residential and commercial sectors.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.komu.com/satellite/SatelliteRender/KOMU.com/ba8a4513-c0a8-2f11-0063-9bd94c70b769/d8d58321-80ce-0971-017d-b4f88f4ea5f5 | title=Columbia Marks a milestone | publisher=KOMU news | last=Haile-Selassie |first=Fanna | date=December 14, 2007 | accessdate=August 8, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209030215/http://www.komu.com/satellite/SatelliteRender/KOMU.com/ba8a4513-c0a8-2f11-0063-9bd94c70b769/d8d58321-80ce-0971-017d-b4f88f4ea5f5 |archivedate = February 9, 2008[/tpl] The University of Missouri, which has tremendous economic impact on the city, experienced record enrollment in 2006[tpl]cite web | url=http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2007/0820-freshmen-enrollment.php | title=MU Freshman Enrollment Surpasses 5,000 | work=University of Missouri News Bureau | accessdate=January 1, 2008[/tpl] and is undertaking significant construction.

==Geography==

Columbia, located in northern mid-Missouri, is [tpl]convert|120|mi|km[/tpl] away from both St. Louis and Kansas City, and [tpl]convert|29|mi|km[/tpl] north of the state capital Jefferson City.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.medpedsresidency.missouri.edu/columbia_missouri.htm | title=About Columbia| work=MU internal Medicine and Child Health | accessdate=January 11, 2008[/tpl] The city is near the Missouri River[tpl]cite web | url=http://chamber.columbia.mo.us/community/about.asp?Maps | title=Maps | work=Columbia Chamber of Commerce | accessdate=January 11, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209060935/http://chamber.columbia.mo.us/community/about.asp?Maps |archivedate = February 9, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] between the Ozark Plateau and the Northern Plains.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/ozar/hrs3.htm | title=Early Settlement Rural...Ozark Frontier | work=National Park Service | accessdate=January 11, 2008[/tpl] Trees are mainly oak, maple, and hickory;[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mdc.mo.gov/forest/IandE/oak_hickory/ | title=Missouri's Oaks and Hickories | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=January 11, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060929053910/http://www.mdc.mo.gov/forest/IandE/oak_hickory/ |archivedate = September 29, 2006[/tpl] common understory trees include eastern redbud, Serviceberry, and flowering dogwood. Riparian areas are forested with mainly American sycamore. Much of the residential area of the city is planted with large native shade trees. In Autumn, the changing color of the trees is notable. Most species here are typical of the Eastern Woodland.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|63.40|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|63.08|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|0.32|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is water.[tpl]cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=July 8, 2012[/tpl]

===Topography===

The city generally slopes from the highest point in the Northeast to the lowest point in the Southwest towards the Missouri River. Prominent tributaries of the river are Perche Creek, Hinkson Creek, and Flat Branch Creek. Along these and other creeks in the area can be found large valleys, cliffs, and cave systems such as that in Rock Bridge State Park just south of the city. These creeks are largely responsible for numerous stream valleys giving Columbia hilly terrain similar to the Ozarks while also having prairie flatland typical of northern Missouri. Columbia also operates several greenbelts with trails and parks throughout town.

===Animal life===

Large mammals found in the city include urbanized coyotes[tpl]cite web | url=http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/coyote/ | title=Coyote | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=January 11, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060928232433/http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/coyote/ |archivedate = September 28, 2006[/tpl] and numerous whitetail deer.[tpl]cite web | url=http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/deer2/ | title=Whitetale deer | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=January 11, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060928232140/http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/deer2/ |archivedate = September 28, 2006[/tpl] Eastern gray squirrel,[tpl]cite web | url=http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/squirrel/ | title=Eastern Gray Squirrel | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=January 11, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060928232328/http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/squirrel/ |archivedate = September 28, 2006[/tpl] and other rodents are abundant, as well as cottontail rabbits and the nocturnal opossum[tpl]cite web | url=http://mdc4.mdc.mo.gov/applications/MDCLibrary/MDCLibrary2.aspx?NodeID=394 | title=Mammals (In Missouri) | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=January 11, 2008[/tpl] and raccoon. Large bird species are abundant in parks and include the Canada goose, Mallard duck, as well as shorebirds, including the Great Egret and Great Blue Heron. Turkeys are also common in wooded areas and can occasionally be seen on the MKT recreation trail. Populations of Bald Eagles are found by the Missouri River. The city is on the Mississippi Flyway, used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern U.S. The Eurasian Tree Sparrow, an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. Columbia has large areas of forested and open land and many of these areas are home to wildlife.
Frogs are commonly found in the springtime, especially after extensive wet periods. Common species include the American toad and species of chorus frogs, commonly called "spring peepers" that are found in nearly every pond. Some years have outbreaks of cicadas or ladybugs. Mosquitos and houseflies are common insect nuisances; because of this, windows are nearly universally fitted with screens, and "screened-in" porches are common in homes of the area.

===Climate===

Columbia has a climate marked by sharp seasonal contrasts in temperature, falling between a humid continental and humid subtropical climate (Köppen Dfa/Cfa, respectively), and is located in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 6.http://www.arborday.org/treeinfo/ZoneInfo.cfm?ZipCode=65201&submit=Look+it+up%21 The monthly daily average temperature ranges from [tpl]convert|29.7|°F|1[/tpl] in January to [tpl]convert|77.3|°F|1[/tpl] in July, while the high reaches or exceeds [tpl]convert|90|°F|0[/tpl] on an average 32 days per year, [tpl]convert|100|°F|0[/tpl] on 2 days, while 4 nights of sub-[tpl]convert|0|°F|0[/tpl] lows can be expected. Precipitation tends to be greatest and most frequent in the latter half of spring, when severe weather is also most common. Snow averages [tpl]convert|18.4|in|cm|0[/tpl] per season, mostly from December to March, with some November accumulation and falls in April being rarer. Extreme temperatures have ranged from [tpl]convert|−26|°F|0[/tpl] on February 12, 1899 to [tpl]convert|113|°F|0[/tpl] on July 12 and 14, 1954.

==Cityscape==

Columbia's most commonly recognizable architectural attributes reside downtown and within the university campuses. Widely used icons of the city are the University of Missouri's Jesse Hall and the neo-gothic Memorial Union. The David R. Francis Quadrangle is an example of Thomas Jefferson's academic village concept. There are four historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places within the city: Downtown Columbia, East Campus Neighborhood, Francis Quadrangle, and North Ninth Street Historic District.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/nrlist.htm | title=Recent Listings | work=National Park Service | accessdate=January 1, 2008[/tpl] The downtown skyline is relatively low and is dominated by the 10-story Tiger Hotel, and the 15-story Paquin Tower.
Downtown Columbia is an area of approximately one square mile surrounded by the University of Missouri on the south, Stephens College to the east and Columbia College on the north. The area serves as Columbia's financial and business district and is the topic of a large initiative to draw tourism, which includes plans to capitalize on the area's historic architecture, and Bohemian characteristics.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.downtown.org/index.html | title=Discover The District | work=The District | accessdate=January 1, 2008[/tpl] The city's historic residential core lies in a ring around downtown, extending especially to the west along Broadway, and south into the East Campus neighborhoods. Columbia can be divided into roughly 36 neighborhoods and subdivisions.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gocolumbiamo.com/Public_Comm/Neighborhood_Associations/documents/NAContactList.pdf |format=PDF| title=Columbia, Missouri Neighborhood Associations | work=City of Columbia| accessdate=January 1, 2008[/tpl] The city's most dense commercial areas are primarily located along Interstate 70, U.S. Route 63, Stadium Blvd, Grindstone Pkwy, and the downtown area.

==Government and politics==

The City of Columbia's current government was established by a home rule charter adopted by voters on November 11, 1974, which established a Council-manager government that invested power in the City Council. The City Council is made up of seven members – six elected by each of Columbia's six wards, plus an at-large council member, the Mayor, who is elected by all city voters. All members of the council, none of whom receive a salary for their work, are elected to staggered three-year terms. The Mayor, in addition to being a voting member of the City Council, is recognized as the head of city government for ceremonial purposes. Chief executive authority is invested in a city manager, who oversees the day-to-day operations of government.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gocolumbiamo.com/Council/Columbia_Code_of_Ordinances/Chapter_99/01.html | title=Columbia Code of Ordinances | work=City of Columbia | accessdate=January 1, 2008[/tpl]
