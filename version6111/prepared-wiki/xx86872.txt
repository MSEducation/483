[[Lodomeria]]

Lodomeria is the Latinized name of [tpl]lang-pl|Wladimeria[/tpl] ([tpl]Lang-hu|Lodoméria[/tpl]) lands conquered by Vladimir the Great and named after him. The capital city of the Principality of Volhynia founded in 987, i.e. Wlodimer (or Volodymyr) was also named after him. In the following centuries the placename became synonymous with the broadly defined Galicia (Eastern Europe). After the annexation of south-eastern borderlands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Partitions of Poland, Lodomeria together with Galicia formed one of the many titles of the Emperor of Austria, the ruler of Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. However, Lodomeria existed only on paper, had no territory and could not be found on any map.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.summagallicana.it/lessico/g/Galizia.htm |title=Lessico: Regno di Galizia e Lodomeria |publisher=Summa Gallicana: La Genetica del Pollo |work=Origine e variazioni del nome |accessdate=11 February 2014 |author=Elio Corti |quote=La Lodomeria esisteva solo sulla carta; non aveva territorio e non poteva essere trovata su alcuna mappa.[/tpl]

==Name origin==

The American Notes and Queries published in 1889 stated that Lodomeria was an ancient district of Poland situated in eastern portion of the country. In 938 the Ruthenian Grand Prince Vladimir (Wladimir) annexed the principality and named it after himself. In 1198 the nominal title of a Lodomeria ruler was created by one of his descendants. In 1340 the King of Poland Casimir reunited Lodomeria with Poland.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=luYAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=%22Wladimeria%22+938&source=bl&ots=9e6A7NhPDc&sig=qI75sgfT2wYU8owsBshNFy0tJjg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QDCSUtbgDKGciQLox4HYCg&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Wladimeria%22%20938&f=false |title=American Notes and Queries, Volume 3 |publisher=Original by Westminster Publishing, Philadelphia from Harvard University |year=1889 |accessdate=24 November 2013 |author=William Shepard Walsh, Henry Collins Walsh, William H.

In reality the origin of Volhynia is disputed. It is first mentioned in Ruthenian chronicles as the region that was conquered by the Grand Prince of Kiev Vladimir the Great who established the city of Vladimir (today Volodymyr-Volynskyi) as an administrative center of the Volhynia. Since then Volhynia is known to be contested between Grand Duchy of Ruthenia, Kingdom of Poland, Kingdom of Hungary, Golden Horde, and Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
In 1199 along with the Principality of Halych, Volhynia formed the Duchy of Galicia and Volhynia under Prince of Roman the Great. After the death of Roman the Great in 1205, King of Hungary (Andrew II of Hungary) adopted the title of King of Galicia and Lodomeria, while in reality Volhynia belonged to the Polish kings.
