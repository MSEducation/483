Nowendoc National Park is a park on the southern end of the Northern Tablelands and west of  Nowendoc, New South Wales, Australia. It is located approximately 70 km south of Walcha and about 375 km north of Sydney.  
The park is in the rugged escarpment terrain with eucalypt forests dominating the region, along with some rainforest along creeks. This park includes parts of the Myall and Callaghans Creeks which form part of the headwaters of the Barnard River.

==Access and facilities==

All access roads to the park have a gravel surface, winding and steep in places and are unsuitable for caravans. The park is in two sections. The largest section can be reached from north-west of Nowendoc to visit the Myall Creek Camp Ground or view Callaghans Canyon. The south-eastern section with Wrights Hut is only accessible by a Four-wheel drive (4WD) and obtaining a key from the National Parks and Wildlife Service for the locked gate on the trail south of Nowendoc The smaller, separate forested section is located on Millers Road.
There is a small, very basic camping area situated in a tall eucalypt forest beside Myall Creek with a wood-fired pit barbecue, but no other facilities. This and the Wrights Hut section area are accessible in dry weather with a 4WD. Self-reliant bushwalkers can explore local scenic waterfalls and rainforest.  Further afield from the campground there are scenic canyons, waterfalls and heritage places.Nowendoc National Park Retrieved on 18-3-2009
