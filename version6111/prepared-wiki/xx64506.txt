The won (圓) was the currency of Korea between 1902 and 1910. It was subdivided into 100 chon (錢).

==Etymology==

Won  is a cognate of the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen.

==History==

The won was introduced in 1902, replacing the yang at a rate of 1 won = 5 yang. In 1909, the Bank of Korea (한국은행; 韓國銀行) was founded in Seoul as a central bank and began issuing currency of a modern type. The won was equivalent to the Japanese yen and was replaced by the Korean yen in 1910 during the Colonial Era. In 1910, the Bank of Korea was renamed the Bank of Joseon (조선은행; 朝鮮銀行), which issued notes denominated in yen and sen.

==Coins==

Coins were minted in the denominations of ½, 1, 5, 10 and 20 chon, ½, 5, 10 and 20 won. The coins all carried the title of the "state", Daehan (대한; 大韓), and the Korean era name, Gwangmu (광무; 光武) and then Yunghui (융희;隆熙), whilst the specifications were equivalent to the coins of the Japanese yen.

==Banknotes==

No banknotes were issued denominated in won. However, Korean yen notes were issued by Dai Ichi Ginko (First National Bank (of Japan), 주식회사제일은행, 株式會社第一銀行).
