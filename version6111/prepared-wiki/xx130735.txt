The Stars and Stripes Trilogy  is a collection of three alternate history novels written by Harry Harrison.

==Setting==

All three novels involve the point of divergence of British involvement in the American Civil War after the Trent Affair. This happens when Prince Albert dies prematurely rather than playing his historic role in resolving the crisis. The Queen blames the Americans. She authorizes her ministers to do anything necessary to ensure that they pay for it.
There is another unexplained difference - the Duke of Wellington is still alive, though he remarks he has been 'living on borrowed time' since his illness in 1852.  In our world, 1852 was the date of his death.  This seems to date the point of divergence to before 1852, without the butterfly effect changing intermediate occurrences, such as the course of the Crimean War.
