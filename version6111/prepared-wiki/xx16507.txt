The minuet and trio eventually became the standard third movement in the four-movement classical symphony, Johann Stamitz being the first to employ it thus with regularity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] A livelier form of the minuet later developed into the scherzo (which was generally also coupled with a trio). This term came into existence approximately from Beethoven onwards, but the form itself can be traced back to Haydn. An example of the true form of the minuet is to be found in Don Giovanni.
A famous example of a more recent instrumental work in minuet form is Ignacy Jan Paderewski's Minuet in G.
