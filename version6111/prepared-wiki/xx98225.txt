[[List of Bologna metro stations]]

CATEGORIES: Rapid transit in Italy

The following was a list of stations on the Metropolitana di Bologna, a old project of underground in Bologna. The project of the underground had stalled after a dispute between Regione Emilia-Romagna, the local government and the central government. A new project has been approved in 2007 and is now partially funded by the Government. On October 13, 2009 the municipal government decided to use a project financing strategy in order to provide for a quick start of the works.[tpl]it icon[/tpl] Metrò, Delbono chiama i privati http://corrieredibologna.corriere.it/bologna/notizie/cronaca/2009/13-ottobre-2009/metro-delbono-chiama-privati-finanza-progetto-aggirare-patto--1601874853614.shtml The new project originally included an overground segment.[tpl]it icon[/tpl] Progetto di metrotranvia per la città di Bologna http://urp.comune.bologna.it/Mobilita/Mobilita.nsf/3b5a117046b7c6e7c1256e3c0056b9e2/ded1dbaa5f642f37c125714f002e4280/$FILE/metrotranvia_11_04_06.pdf On October 15, 2009 the idea of building a partially overground system was abandoned, and the system is probably going to be entirely underground.[tpl]it icon[/tpl] Un percorso tutto sotterraneo per il metrò http://corrieredibologna.corriere.it/bologna/notizie/cronaca/2009/15-ottobre-2009/percorso-tutto-sotterraneo-il-metro-1601881371423.shtml
