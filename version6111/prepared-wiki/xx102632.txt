CATEGORIES: REO Speedwagon albums, 1980 albums, Epic Records albums

Hi Infidelity is the ninth studio album by REO Speedwagon, released in 1980 (see 1980 in music). It went on to become the biggest selling rock LP of 1981, eventually selling over ten million copies. Six songs from this album hit Billboard charts, including "Keep On Loving You" which was the band's first Number 1 hit, and "Take It on the Run", which reached No. 5 on the charts. The album title is a play on the term Hi-Fi (high fidelity), and the album art is an illustration of this pun where an act of sexual infidelity is occurring while the man is putting a record LP to play on the hi-fi stereo.
In October 2004, the band recorded the songs of this album live from beginning to end for an XM Radio "Then Again Live" special.
On July 21, 2011, Sony Music rereleased Hi Infidelity with Bonus Demo tracks for the album's 30th anniversary.
