The Festgesang (Gutenberg cantata), also known as Festgesang zur Eröffnung der am ersten Tage der vierten Säkularfeier der Erfindung der Buchdruckerkunst, was composed by Felix Mendelssohn in the first half of 1840 for performance in Leipzig at the celebrations to mark the putative quatercentenary of the invention of printing with movable type by Johannes Gutenberg. It was first performed in the market-square at Leipzig on 24 June 1840.Todd, R. Larry, Mendelssohn: a life in music (Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 396). 
The piece is scored for male chorus with two brass orchestras and timpani, and consists of four parts, the first and last based on established Lutheran chorales. Part 2, beginning “Vaterland, in deinen Gauen”, was later adapted to the words of Wesley’s Christmas carol Hark! The Herald Angels Sing. The original German words for the Festgesang were by Adolf Eduard Proelss (1803–1882). The use of a large choir and two orchestras was designed to make use of the natural acoustics of the market-place to produce an impressive, resonant sound. 
Mendelssohn wrote at least two other Festgesänge, with which the present work are sometimes confused, known as Festgesang an die Künstler (1846) and Festgesang (“Möge das Siegeszeichen”) (1838).Cooper, John Michael, “Mendelssohn’s works: prolegomenon to a comprehensive inventory” in Seaton, Douglas, The Mendelssohn companion (Westport, Conn. and London: Greenwood Press, 2001, p. 721).
