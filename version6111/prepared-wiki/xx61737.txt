Said Greenwood, "She’s responsible for our precocious love of miserable music. The Fall, Magazine, Joy Division. We were ostracised at school because everyone else was into Iron Maiden.”[tpl]cite news | first=Matt | last=Hendrickson | title=Dream Weavers | date=16 October 1997 | url =http://radioheadperu.com/prensa/i_rs97.html | work =Rolling Stone | accessdate = 2007-06-17 [/tpl]
When Greenwood was 12 years old, he met future band mate Thom Yorke at Abingdon School, an independent school for boys.[tpl]cite news | first=John | last=Kelly | title=Taking Music To Strange Places | date=15 September 2001 | url =http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2001/0915/01091500133.html | work =The Irish Times | accessdate = 2007-06-16 [/tpl] Future band mates Ed O'Brien, who Greenwood met during a production of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Trial by Jury", and Phil Selway also attended the school.[tpl]cite news | first=Caren | last=Myers | title=Dork Radio | date=1 November 1993 | url =http://radioheadperu.com/prensa/i_details.html | work =Details | accessdate = 2007-06-16 [/tpl]  When Greenwood was 15 years old he bought his first guitar,[tpl]cite news | first=Stewart | last=Clark | title=Transistor Act | date=12 July 1995 | url =http://www.hotpress.com/music/interviews/416813.html | work =Hot Press| accessdate = 2007-06-16 [/tpl] studying classical guitar with influential teacher Terence Gilmore-James. It was Gilmore-James who introduced him and the other future members of Radiohead to jazz, film scores, post World War II era avant-garde music, and twentieth century classical music. Said Greenwood, "When we started, it was very important that we got support from him, because we weren't getting any from the headmaster. You know, the man once sent us a bill, charging us for the use of school property, because we practiced in one of the music rooms on a Sunday."
According to Greenwood, it was out of necessity that he first picked up a bass, teaching himself by playing along to New Order, Joy Division and Otis Redding. “We were people who picked up their respective instruments because we wanted to play music together, rather than just because we wanted to play that particular instrument. So it was more of a collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool. I don’t think of myself as a bass player anyway. I’m just in a band with other people."  Among his greatest musical influences are Booker T and the MGs. “I’m really more of a soulboy. Bill Withers and Curtis Mayfield, those are the people who informed me in playing the bass. That combination of rhythm and melody.”

Greenwood first teamed up with classmate Thom Yorke in 1986 to start a band, then known as On a Friday; Ed O'Brien was then recruited, and finally, older student Phil Selway was approached to join the band. Later, Greenwood's younger brother Jonny, then 14 years old, also joined the band. Of being in a band with his brother, Colin has said, "...beyond the normal brotherly thing, I respect him as a person and a musician," and has quipped, “It’s wonderful, it’s good, it makes my promise to keep an eye on him for my mother a lot easier, having him right next to me all the time. But he’s very easy to look after anyway, 'cause he’s very well behaved.”[tpl]cite news | first=Jason | last=Davis | title=Interview with Colin Greenwood | date=1 February 1998 | url =http://radioheadperu.com/prensa/i_channelv.html | work =Channel V, Australia | accessdate = 2007-06-17 [/tpl]
While an undergraduate studying English at Peterhouse, Cambridge between 1987 and 1990, Greenwood read modern American literature, including Raymond Carver, John Cheever and other writers “dealing with the tensions of post-war American society."[tpl]cite news | first=Nick | last=Kent | title=Happy Now? | date=1 June 2001 | url =http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2001&cutting=121 | work =MOJO | accessdate = 2007-03-26 [/tpl] At Peterhouse, Greenwood served as the college's entertainment officer, and helped arrange several gigs on Fridays. Later, whilst working at the music chain store, Our Price, he had a hand in helping the band get off the ground. When Keith Wozencroft, as a sales rep for EMI, entered the store one day, Greenwood said, "You should sign my band," and handed him their demo tape. That got it all started for the band, with EMI. At this time the band renamed themselves Radiohead.
Greenwood plays a number of instruments for Radiohead including electric- and acoustic bass, double bass, keyboards, samplers, and synthesizers, and a variety of percussive instruments. He favours Fender basses.[tpl]cite news | first=Peter | last=Clements | title=Plank's Blog – full archive | date=7 June 2007 | url =http://www.stringsreunited.com/plankarchive.shtml | work =StringsReunited – getting your sound back | accessdate = 2007-06-16 [/tpl] Said Greenwood, "My involvement is to play bass guitar, but our ideas and suggestions in certain areas, as to where the music should go or develop, are listened to. We are very much a band."[tpl]cite news | first=Patrick | last=MacDonald | title=Radio wave: Britain's band rides crest of superstardom with low-wattage egos | date=4 February 1998 | url =http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2001&cutting=121 | work =Seattle Times | accessdate = 2007-06-17 [/tpl]

In 1997 Greenwood participated in a marketing campaign for alma mater Cambridge University, posing for a photo with then-current students from both state and private schools for a poster entitled “Put Yourself in the Picture.” The poster was “designed to break down some of the stereotypes that deter able students from applying to Cambridge and encourage more state school applicants.”[tpl]cite news | title=Annual Report: All Access | date=21 August 1997 | url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/annualreport/1997-8/f.html | work =University of Cambridge Annual Report | accessdate = 2007-06-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070317132627/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/annualreport/1997-8/f.html  |archivedate = 17 March 2007[/tpl]
In 2003 Greenwood, an amateur photographer whose images are often posted on Radiohead's website, Dead Air Space, discussed his favourite images in the V&A’s photography gallery, a collection “ranging from early daguerreotype and calotype prints through to modern digital prints,”[tpl]cite news | title=Photography collection at the V&A redisplayed and online | date=1 May 2003 | url=http://www.cogapp.com/home/1870856.html | work =Cognitive Applications News | accessdate = 2007-06-15 [/tpl] as part of their accompanying website’s Personal Tours. Greenwood chose images by Frederick Sommer and Harold Edgerton among several others.
In 2004 Greenwood served as a judge for the Next Generation Poets talent contest, sponsored by the Arts Council of England. The same year, he participated on a panel in the annual sixth form conference run by Radley College in collaboration with School of St Helen and St Katharine, speaking on digital-rights management (DRM) from "the views of an artist, someone without whom there would be no music to share in the first place,"[tpl]cite news | first=David | last=Smith | title=That old Digital Rights tune again | date=26 September 2004 | url =http://www.preoccupations.org/2004/09/music_downloadi.html | work =Preoccupations | accessdate = 2007-06-16 [/tpl] according to David Smith, at that time a professor at Radley.[tpl]cite news | first=David | last=Smith | title=Today, Truth! | date=8 November 2006 | url=http://www.preoccupations.org/2006/11/today_truth.html | work =Preoccupations | accessdate = 2007-06-16 [/tpl]

According to Graham Lees, Radiohead's touring audio engineer, "The Bass guitar is DI-ed and Mic-ed with a Sennheiser 609."[tpl]cite web| last = Less| first = Graham| title = radioheadstageplan| publisher = flickr| date = 17 June 2007| url = http://www.flickr.com/photos/colin_greenwood/556783758/| accessdate = 2009-04-26[/tpl]

====Monitors====

Lees: "Colin uses Wedges alone, he has never tried in ears up to now, but has expressed an interest in trying them on the next tour. He also has a sub bass unit behind him to add extra weight on the low frequencies, mainly the kick drum and the drum machines. He has a full mix of everything on stage."[tpl]cite news | first=Graham | last=Lees | title=Graham's MySpace Blog – full archive | date=7 June 2006 | url = | work =On the Road with Graham | accessdate = 2007-06-15 [/tpl]
