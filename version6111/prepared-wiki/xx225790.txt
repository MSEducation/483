M. Sampath was a Sri Lankan cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played for Kalutara Town Club.
Sampath made a single first-class appearance for the team during the 1996-97 Saravanamuttu Trophy campaign, Kalutara's only season in first-class cricket, against Antonians. Batting in the middle of the order, Sampath made a commendable 38 runs in the first innings, partnering Gayan Anupama and Saman Fonseka, the latter of whom finished just shy of a half century. Though Sampath did not score as highly in the second innings, the team were unable to put up a defence to the bowling of Gamini Perera, who finished the match with twelve wickets to his credit.
