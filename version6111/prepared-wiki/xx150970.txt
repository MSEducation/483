</ref> Due to dust coverage, it typically appears bright in telescopic views, and was mapped as a classical [[albedo feature]], Isidis Regio, visible by telescope in the pre-spacecraft era.
The Beagle 2 lander was about to land in the eastern part of Isidis Planitia in December 2003 when contact with the craft was lost. Just to the west of Isidis is Syrtis Major Planum, a low-relief shield volcano that is a prominent dark albedo feature of Mars, which formed after the basin.[ref]

Around the Isidis basin magnesium carbonate was found by MRO. This mineral indicates that water was present and that it was not acidic, pH conditions more favorable for the evolution of life.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Murchie|first1=S. L.|last2=Mustard|first2=J.
