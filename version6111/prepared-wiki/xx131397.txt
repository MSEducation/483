Hot Wheels Velocity X is a racing video game released in 2002 by Beyond Games. There are versions for the Gamecube, PlayStation 2, PC, and Game Boy Advance.  The game is based on the Hot Wheels toy automobiles. The game features 11 different gadgets and 5 different worlds - Monument City, Turbine Sands, Crankshaft Bay, Burnout Glacier and Underworld.

==Story==

The story begins when The Hot Wheels car business owned by Dr. Peter Justice, is robbed and bombed. Peter's son, Max Justice, insists to his dad's Robot "Gearhead" that he should try to track down whoever stole the cars and attempt to retrieve them all. He is confronted with various "Villains" on his quest, such as Nitro Byrne, Backroads Belcher, Fast Lane Friscatti, Simon "Slick" Deluca and Rupert Jacoby, all of whom work for Otto Von Diesel (Dr. Peter Justice's Former Assistant).

==Gameplay==

In the main Adventure mode, you have to beat all 14 missions, while completing tasks in each one. These tasks vary from destroying a few vehicles, collecting items, or racing/battling a boss. The World (map) changes every 3 missions (1-3, Monument City, 4-6 Turbine sands etc.)
In the Challenge mode, you have to complete all 18 challenges. Each Challenge comes with various tasks, such as achieving "x" Stunt points, collecting "x" gears, or reaching the finish before the clock hits 00:00. Along the way, new cars as well as new race/battle maps and weapons are unlocked.
The game also has a Drag Race mode, a Battle mode, and a Joyride mode. The Drag Race and Battle modes are both single-player and multiplayer (except in the PC version of the game). The Joyride, in essence, is free roam. You can also unlock cars in Joyride by collecting all ten gears or finding the hidden key in each map.
There are also eight different cheats that can be unlocked by completing the final challenge on different difficulties.

==Cars==

The game has 33 cars that can be unlocked by successfully completing various challenges and missions.  Each car is rated on its speed, grip, stunt, and armor.
