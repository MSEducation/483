Arthur Lowe (22 September 1915 – 15 April 1982) was an English actor. His career spanned over thirty years, including starring roles in numerous theatre and television productions. He is best known for playing Captain George Mainwaring in the British sitcom Dad's Army from 1968 until 1977. He was nominated for seven BAFTAs, and became one of the most recognised faces on television.   
Lowe began his working life shortly before the Second World War (1939–1945) and he featured in many theatrical performances. But it wasn't until he landed the part of Leonard Swindley in the British television soap Coronation Street that he became a household name. He played the character until 1966, while continuing film work. In 1968 he took up his most famous role, in Dad's Army, written by David Croft and Jimmy Perry. His success as this character led to considerable television and theatrical work, which put pressure on his health. Lowe's final years were dominated by alcoholism and illness, and he died on 15 April 1982, aged 66.

==Early life==

Arthur Lowe was born in Hayfield, Derbyshire, the only child of Arthur (1888–1971) and his wife Mary Annie Ford (1885–1981). His father worked for a railway company and was in charge of moving theatrical touring companies around Northern England and the Midlands using special trains."The Stardom of Suburban Man", Evening News, London, 28 October 1977 Arthur Jr. went to Chapel Street Junior School in Chapel Street, Levenshulme, Manchester. His original intention was to join the Merchant Navy, but this was thwarted by his poor eyesight. Working at an aircraft factory, he joined the British Army on the eve of the Second World War, but not before experiencing his first brush with acting by working as a stagehand at the Manchester Palace of Varieties. Lowe served in the Middle East with the Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry, and took part in shows put on for the troops. At the war's end, he was discharged from the Army, having served as a radar technician,John Oliver "Lowe, Arthur (1915–1982)", BFI Screenonline with the rank of Sergeant Major.

==Early career==

Lowe made his debut at the Manchester Repertory Theatre in 1945, where he was paid £5 per week for twice-nightly performances."Arthur Lowe – The Proud Father", TV Times, 14–20 October 1978 He worked with various repertory companies around the country and became known for his character roles, which included parts in the West End musicals Call Me Madam, Pal Joey and The Pajama Game. An early brief film role is as a reporter for the Tit-Bits magazine near the end of Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949).
Lowe married Joan Cooper (1922–1989) on 10 January 1948. They had met in 1945 when she was his leading lady at the Manchester Repertory Theatre, and they remained together until his death. Their son, Stephen Lowe, was born in January 1953.
By the 1960s, Lowe had successfully made the transition to television and landed a regular role as draper/lay preacher Leonard Swindley in the northern drama series Coronation Street (1960–65). His character became sufficiently popular with viewers for him to appear in spin-off series, Pardon the Expression (1966), and its sequel Turn out the Lights (1967).
Leonard Swindley was not a role Lowe relished though, and he longed to move on. During the months he was not playing Swindley he was busy on stage or making one-off guest appearances in other TV series such as Z-Cars (1962) and The Avengers (1967).

==Stardom==

In 1968 Lowe was cast in his best remembered role, as Captain George Mainwaring in the BBC sitcom Dad's Army (1968–77). His colleagues on the show later remarked that the role resembled Lowe himself, pompous and bumbling; Lowe had a clause written into his contract specifying that he would never have to lose his trousers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/dads-army-the-story-of-a-classic-television-show-by-graham-mccann-747678.html|title=Dad's Army: the story of a classic television show by Graham McCann|last=Sale|first=Jonathan|date=15 November 200|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2010|location=London[/tpl] He also successfully played Mainwaring's drunken brother Barry Mainwaring in the 1975 Christmas episode "My Brother and I". Lowe and his character also surfaced in a radio version of Dad's Army, a stage play and a feature length film released in 1971.
While Dad's Army was not in production, Lowe appeared in plays at the National Theatre and the Royal Court Theatre. In 1968 Lowe was invited by Laurence Olivier to act at the National Theatre at the Old Vic and appeared in Somerset Maugham's Home and Beauty in 1968 and later The Tempest in 1974 with John Gielgud.Arthur Lowe by Graham Lord, Orion 2002, p 189 and 224
He also had prominent parts in several films directed by Lindsay Anderson, films including if.... (1968) and multiple roles in O Lucky Man! (1973). His other film roles during this period included Spike Milligan's surreal The Bed Sitting Room (1969), in which he mutates into a parrot, a drunken butler in The Ruling Class (1972) with Peter O'Toole, and Theatre of Blood (1973), a horror film starring Vincent Price, with Lowe as one of the critics murdered by the deranged actor played by Price. At this time he appeared in an unbroadcast series pilot with Dad's Army colleague James Beck, Bunclarke With an E, to be based on scripts written for Hancock's Half Hour, but Beck's death prevented the project developing into a series.Neil Clark "James Beck: the Dad’s Army star cut off in his prime", telegraph.co.uk, 6 August 2013
On television he appeared as a guest performer on The Morecambe and Wise Show (1977), alongside Richard Briers in a series of Ben Travers farces for the BBC, as the pompous Dr Maxwell in the ITV comedy Doctor at Large (1971), and as Redvers Bodkin, a snooty, old-fashioned butler in the short-lived sitcom The Last of the Baskets (1971–72).
Between 1971 and 1973 Lowe joined Dad's Army colleague Ian Lavender on the BBC radio comedy Parsley Sidings, and played Mr Micawber in a BBC television serial of David Copperfield (1974). He employed a multitude of voices on the BBC animated television series Mr. Men (1974), in which he was the narrator in addition to voicing all the characters.

==Later career==

When Dad's Army run ended in 1977, Lowe remained much in demand taking starring roles in television comedies such as Bless Me Father with Daniel Abineri (1978–81) as the mischievous Irish priest Father Charles Clement Duddleswell  – quite a departure from the pompous characters that Lowe usually portrayed  – and Potter (1979–80), as busybody Redvers Potter.
By now he was making many television commercials, but his later stage career mainly involved touring the provinces, appearing in plays and pantomimes with his wife, Joan. In 1981 he reprised his role as Captain Mainwaring for the pilot episode of It Sticks Out Half a Mile, a radio sequel to Dad's Army. At Christmas 1981 Lowe appeared in pantomime with his wife. His last film role was in Lindsay Anderson's Britannia Hospital. In January 1982 Richard Burton had his private aeroplane fly Lowe to film a cameo role in the television series  Wagner, his last onscreen performance.

==Amazon==

When touring at coastal theatres with his wife, Lowe used his distinctive 1885 former steam yacht Amazon as a floating base. He bought Amazon as a houseboat in 1968, but realised her potential and took her back to sea in 1971; this unique vessel is still operating in the Mediterranean today.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldshiptrust.org/memberslinks.htm|title=Links with our members:Museums and Vessels:Amazon|last=Anon|work=World ship trust|accessdate=1 October 2010[/tpl] The ship had a bar with a semicircular notch cut halfway along, to enable both the portly figure of Lowe and his wife to serve behind the bar at the same time, acting as hosts during the parties they threw on board.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/dads-navy-as-captain-mainwaring-he-entertained-millions-with-his-pomposity-and-his-delusions-of-grandeur-but-the-real-arthur-lowe-fancied-himself-as-a-different-sort-of-captain-1445756.html|title=Dad's Navy: As Captain Mainwaring, he entertained millions with his pomposity and his delusions of grandeur. But the real Arthur Lowe fancied himself as a different sort of captain |accessdate=12 January 2012 | work=The Independent|first=Charles|last=Nevin|date=30 October 1994[/tpl]
In an interview for a Dad's Army retrospective on BBC television in 2010, Lowe's co-star, Clive Dunn, described him sitting at the bar in the evenings when they were filming on location, consuming a drink which Lowe named 'Amazon' after his yacht. Dunn described the drink as comprising "gin and ginger ale, with a single slice of cucumber".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.makemeacocktail.com/recipe/6881/|title=Amazon – Cocktail Recipe[/tpl]

==Death==

In his final years Lowe's alcoholism spiralled out of control and he was reduced to acting in pantomimes and touring theatre productions. Graham Lord's biography recalls that by 1979 Lowe was suffering from major health problems, but continued to drink ever increasing amounts of alcohol, sometimes passing out on stage or at dinner. He was also a heavy smoker and his weight ballooned.
Lowe had long suffered from narcolepsy. He collapsed from the onset of a stroke in his dressing room at the Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham, on 14 April 1982, before a performance of Home at Seven in which he appeared with wife Joan. He died in hospital early the following morning, aged 66.
He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at Sutton Coldfield Crematorium following a sparsely attended funeral. Joan herself did not attend as she refused to miss a performance of Home at Seven and, as a result, was appearing in Belfast at the time. A memorial service was held in May 1982 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, attended by his family, former colleagues and many friends. His last sitcom, [tpl]nowrap|A J Wentworth, BA[/tpl], with Lowe as a boys' preparatory school master, was shown during July and August 1982.
Tom Cole wrote in the Radio Times: "There are few actors who charmed viewers both young and old with such ease, and fewer still who could be trusted with the task of bringing classic literary characters like Charles Pooter and AJ Wentworth to life." His national acclaim continued well after his death with a statue of Lowe erected in the town of Thetford, where most of the location work for Dad's Army was filmed. He was honoured with two blue plaques; one outside his birthplace in Derbyshire and another at Maida Vale. Lowe was respected and admired among colleagues, including Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud. His sudden death received a large number of tributes. Speaking in 2002 Paul Scofield described Lowe as "a rare talent", and a "seriously brilliant actor".
After his death Arthur Lowe received many tributes from British actors. Fellow actor John Inman described Lowe as "a great actor". John Le Mesurier did the same. Similar tributes were made by Jimmy Perry who described him as "a very kind man and would go out of his way to help actors less fortunate than himself. His rich comic genius will be sadly missed". Clive Dunn referred to Lowe as one of the greatest "comic actors" he had ever worked with. Graham Lord wrote, in his 2003 biography, that "almost every actor who worked with Arthur considered him to be outstanding".
