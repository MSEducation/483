[[Polar Night Halfmarathon]]

CATEGORIES: Half marathons

Polar Night Halfmarathon is an annual half marathon running competition in Tromsø,  Norway. It takes place in the beginning of January, during the Polar night-period, when the sun does not rise above the horizon. At almost 70° north, it is the northernmost AIMS-certified (Association of International Marathons and Distance Races) half marathon in the world. It is renowned for its torch-lit route and the chance of running underneath the aurora borealis.[tpl]cite web|author=Norway |url=http://www.worldeventsguide.com/event/2126/Troms-Norway/Polar-Night-Half-Marathon.html |title=Polar Night Half-Marathon | Tromsø Events |publisher=World Events Guide |date= |accessdate=2010-01-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.runabroad.com/2008/11/polar-night-halfmarathon-norway.html |title=Polar Night Halfmarathon, Norway |publisher=RunAbroad.com |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2010-01-13[/tpl]
