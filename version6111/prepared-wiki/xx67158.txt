Michael "Mick" Hucknall (born 8 June 1960) is an English pop singer and songwriter. Formerly the lead singer of the modestly successful punk rock band The Frantic Elevators, Hucknall achieved international fame in the 1980s as the lead singer and songwriter of the soul-influenced pop band Simply Red, with whom he enjoyed a 25-year career and eventually sold over 50 million albums. Hucknall is recognisable for his smooth, distinctive voice and wide vocal range, as well as his red curly hair. He has been described by critic Trevor J. Leeden as "one of the truly great blue-eyed soul singers."[tpl]cite web | url= https://rhythms.com.au/reviews/mick-hucknall-american-soul/ | title= Mick Hucknall - American Soul | first=Trevor J|last=Leeden|work=Rhythms | accessdate=1 June 2013[/tpl]

==Early life==

Hucknall was born in Denton as an only child. His mother left him when he was three; the upheaval caused by this event inspired him to write "Holding Back the Years," which would become one of Simply Red's biggest and most well-known hits.  He was raised by his father, Reginald (1935–2009),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.simplyred.com/index.php?id=550|title=Reginald Hucknall 1935–2009 R.I.P.|publisher=Mick Hucknall – Simply Red – Official Site|accessdate=22 November 2009[/tpl] a barber in Stockport.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1375942/Simply-Red-star-cleared-after-arrest-for-rape.html|title=Simply Red star cleared after arrest for rape|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=19 June 2001|accessdate=11 October 2008  | first=Hugh | last=Davies[/tpl] He attended Audenshaw School.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/traditional-values-pay-off-for-school-with-best-results-897547.html|title=Traditional values pay off for school with best results|work=The Independent |location=UK |date=9 August 2008|accessdate=5 October 2008  | first=Sarah | last=Cassidy[/tpl] It would not be until the mid-1990s that he would finally reconnect with his mother, Maureen, who was by then living in Dallas.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2003/mar/23/features.review17|title=The mother of all bachelors|work=The Observer|date=23 March 2003|author=Ellen, Barbara | location=London[/tpl] As of a 2008 interview, he had only seen her on two occasions since she first abandoned the family.2008 Mick Hucknall Exclusive article
