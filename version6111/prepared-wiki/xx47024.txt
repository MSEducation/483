The Caribbean Series (Spanish: Serie del Caribe), also called Caribbean World Series, is the highest baseball tournament at club level in Latin America, featuring the champion teams of Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela. The tournament is hosted annually at each country every fourth year and is normally played in February after all the leagues have ended their national tournaments.
The 2014 Caribbean Series was held at Estadio Nueva Esparta in Margarita Island, Venezuela. Cuba accepted an invitation to take part as guest in the tournament.

==History==

The competition was the brainchild of Venezuelan baseball entrepreneur Pablo Morales, who devised the idea after seeing the success of the now extinct Serie Interamericana in 1946, which featured the Sultanes de Monterrey from Mexico; the All Cubans from Cuba; the Brooklyn Bushwicks from United States, and the Cervecería Caracas from Venezuela. The Bushwicks won each year from 1946 to 1949, while the Cervecería Caracas club won the final tournament in 1950.
Inspired by the Serie Interamericana and his experience as a former president of the FIBA in 1946–1947, Morales presented his idea for a for a regional baseball tournament during the Caribbean Baseball Confederation conference in Miami on August 21, 1948. Cuba agreed to host the first Series, which would feature the top team from each of the nations that were then CBC members – Cuba, Panama, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela – in a six-game round-robin tournament to determine the winner.
The Series ran annually from 1949 to 1960, with Cuba winning seven times. However, the event was cancelled after Fidel Castro dissolved all professional baseball in Cuba in 1961. It was not until 1970 when the Caribbean Series was revived.
