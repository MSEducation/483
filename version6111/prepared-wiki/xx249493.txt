"Rude Boy" is a song by Barbadian singer Rihanna, taken from her fourth studio album, Rated R (2009), that was released as the third single from the album on February 19, 2010, through Def Jam. Rihanna co-wrote the song with Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Ester Dean, Makeba Riddick, and Rob Swire, with Swire also co-producing it with Eriksen and Hermansen, known together as StarGate. "Rude Boy" is an up-tempo song and incorporates elements of raggamuffin, pop and R&B.
The song received mixed to positive reviews from critics; some called it is the highlight of the album, but others criticized Rihanna's "monotone" and "icy" vocal performance. "Rude Boy" peaked at number one the US Billboard Hot 100 in its fourth week for five consecutive weeks, and was Rihanna's sixth US number one single. It was a commercial success globally, peaked at number one in Australia and attained top five positions in Germany, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Slovakia and the United Kingdom.
The accompanying music video was directed by Melina Matsoukas, used greenscreen techniques and featured  props that included a stuffed lion and zebra. Rihanna performed the song live for the first time at the Pepsi Super Bowl Fan Jam in South Beach, Miami, and later on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Nickelodeon's 2010 Kids' Choice Awards, and Alan Carr: Chatty Man. "Rude Boy" was also featured on the set lists of Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth, Loud and Diamonds tours.

==Background and development==

"Rude Boy" was written by its producers Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen (under their stage name Stargate) alongside Rihanna herself, Ester Dean, and Makeba Riddick, with additional writing and production by Rob Swire.[tpl]cite web|last=Lamb|first=Bill|url=http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/rihannarudeboy.htm|title=Rihanna – Rude Boy – Review of Rude Boy Single By Rihanna – About.com |work=About.com|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2011-08-09[/tpl] During an interview on the television show, Alan Carr: Chatty Man in February 2010, Carr asked Rihanna about the song's lyrics, with particular emphasis on the line "Come here Rude Boy, Boy, can you get it up?/Come here Rude Boy, Boy, is you big enough?"[tpl]Cite episode |title=Alan Carr: Chatty Man |episodelink= |series= 3|serieslink=Alan Carr: Chatty Man#Series 3 |credits=Alan Carr |network=Channel 4 |station=Channel 4 |airdate=2010-02-25 |season=3 |seriesno=3 |number=4 |minutes=40:00 |quote= |language=English[/tpl] Rihanna explained: "When we wrote the song, it was kind of a freestyle ... I liked the West Indian influence that the music had, and, I just went in the booth, they were already jotting down some ideas and, that came to me, I just ran in there with the, one of the writers and started coming up with this in the studio and now when people read it back to me like that, 'Come here Rude Boy, is you big enough'?, it does sound so disgusting!" She also explained the development of the song, and said that those lyrics were originally going to be the introduction, but because of the song's infectious beat, Rihanna decided to make it the hook instead.
In an interview with Us Weekly, Makeba Riddick, who assisted with the song's vocal production, spoke about the inspiration for the song.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/moviestvmusic/news/meet-the-music-producer-behind-rihannas-hit-rude-boy-2010293|title=Meet the Songwriter Behind Rihanna's Hit 'Rude Boy'|work=Us Weekly|publisher=Wenner Media|date=2010-03-29|accessdate=2011-09-29[/tpl] Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song, and had been working with Stargate to develop it. Upon hearing it, Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed, and sent it to Riddick for completion. Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from: "I was listening to the words and me and Rihanna and we were just laughing and talking about so many situations that have happened in the past and that happen to women everywhere. By the time we were done of course, we were laughing and giggling about the lyrics – surprisingly everybody went nuts over the song." Dean explained the development of "Rude Boy" in an interview with The Boom Box, and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song's lyrics.[tpl]cite web|last=Murphy|first=Keith|url=http://www.theboombox.com/2011/01/19/rude-boy-writer-ester-dean-on-penning-hits-for-rihanna-usher/|title='Rude Boy' writer Ester Dean on penning for Rihanna, Usher|publisher=The Boom Box|date=2011-01-19|accessdate=2011-09-29[/tpl] Dean praised Rihanna's ability to take risks with her music, saying "I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won't say. Even if she says let's go kiss some girls, who really cares ... that's Rihanna. Music is about fantasy. This is what people want to do, but are afraid to do."

Rihanna's vocal range spans from the low note of E3 to the high note of D,5 and the song follows a sequence of Am–Em–F–Dm as its chord progression. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian commented that "Rude Boy", and the album's previous single "Hard", were the highlights of Rated R, praised the singer's vocal performance in the song, "both of which exploit Rihanna's most appealing vocal style, a sulky, icy, monotone."[tpl]cite news|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/nov/19/rihanna-cd-review|title=Rihanna: Rated R|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=2009-11-19|accessdate=2011-08-09|location=London[/tpl] Michael Menachem of Billboard magazine commented on the lyrical content of the song, and wrote, "with 'Rude Boy', Rihanna delivers her most provocative lyrics and perhaps most authentic-sounding single to date."[tpl]cite web|last=Menachem|first=Micheal|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1069693/rihanna-rude-boy|title=Rihanna, 'Rude Boy'|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=2010-02-26|accessdate=2011-09-10[/tpl] Menachem also wrote about the song's composition, "Steel drums are a welcome presence on the production, which gives a nod to ska and dancehall. Rihanna's swagger has never been as convincing as on this song."

===Critical response===

Los Angeles Times[tpl]'[/tpl] reviewer Ann Powers stated that the song has a  "ragamuffin-style", and commented on the lyrics, "Even as she offers herself in no uncertain terms—'I'm gon' let you be the captain tonight' she sneers—she questions his prowess. 'Can you get it up? Are you big enough?' she repeats in the singsong chorus, making it tough to imagine that any suitor could rise to this occasion." Bill Lamb of About.com praised the song, and called it "the most instantly engaging song from the album Rated R", and that "Rihanna projects a dominant female image that is exactly what was needed to move past the unfortunate Chris Brown chapter in her career". However, Lamb added that the "icy feel is wearing thin. Rihanna sounds like she has taken a few steps back to distance herself from the whole song. There is a pleasing swagger, but we're never quite engaged".
Nick Levine of Digital Spy, commenting on the genre of the song and Rihanna's musical direction and transition from her previous album Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), wrote, "[tpl]'[/tpl]Rude Boy' can be construed as a winning synthesis of her Island-pop beginnings, the effortless hitmaking of the Good Girl Gone Bad era and the more menacing persona she's unveiled post-Grammygate. On the other, it's just a damn good tune." Levine also wrote that "Rude Boy" is "the most instantly catchy moment" on Rated R. Alibhe Malone of NME commented on the song's demeanor in relation to Rated R as a whole, and wrote, "With only one other female songwriter here apart from Rihanna (Ester Dean on ‘Rude Boy’) it’s a startlingly masculine record – in sound and in attitude."[tpl]cite news|last=Malone|first=Alibhe|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/rihanna/10985|title=Album review: Rihanna – 'Rated R' (Mercury) |work=NME|publisher=IPC Media |date=2009-12-03|accessdate=2011-09-23[/tpl] Malone also wrote that Rihanna persists in ensuring that listener realizes "how she wants men in her bed." Ryan Dombell of Pitchfork Media wrote a mixed review of the song; he called it the flightiest song on Rated R, but praised it as superior to the riskier material on the album.[tpl]cite web|last=Dombell|first=Ryan|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13740-rated-r/|title=Rihanna Rated R|work=Pitchfork Media|publisher=Ryan Schreiber|date=2009-12-03|accessdate=2011-09-23[/tpl]

She explained its artistic qualities, and said, "A lot of my videos are really dark and edgy and tough. 'Rude Boy' is more playing along the lines from my roots. We used a lot of color, but also the costumes were very Jamaican dance-hall-queen type." The video premiered on February 10, 2010, via the high definition music video provider VEVO.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/02/08/on-set-of-rihannas-rude-boy-video/|title=On Set of Rihanna’s 'Rude Boy’ Video|work=Rap-Up|publisher=Devin Lazerine|accessdate=2010-03-18[/tpl]

===Reception and accolades===

Upon the video's release, several media outlets noticed a resemblance between the colorful aesthetics of "Rude Boy" and those of British singer-songwriter and rapper M.I.A.'s video  "Boyz".[tpl]cite web|last=Ryan|first=Chris|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2010/02/12/new-video-rihanna-rude-boy/|title=New Video: Rihanna, 'Rude Boy'|work=MTV|publisher=Viacom|date=2010-02-12|accessdate=2011-08-09[/tpl] Melina Matsoukas responded to the allegations that she had copied the idea, and said, "Afterward I was like, ‘Oh, this sucks. They tore down my video ... M.I.A.'s video’s great too. It definitely wasn’t trying to rip anybody off at all, it was just our approach and the animation stuff, it had a similar vibe." Matsoukas explained that the inspiration for the video did not come from one particular source, but from a variety of pop culture icons. She concluded, "We’re all inspired by similar elements and it came together in that way." Several critics noticed the differences between Rihanna's previous singles, "Russian Roulette" and "Hard", and that "Rude Boy" had adopted a care-free and brighter image. Becky Bain of Idolator also noticed the similarities between M.I.A.'s video "Boyz" and "Rude Boy", and wrote, "We’re digging the reggae-inflected jam, although the Bob Marley-meets-M.I.A. color explosion becomes a little hard on the eyes after awhile."[tpl]cite web|last=Bain|first=becky|url=http://idolator.com/5403752/rihannas-rude-boy-video-politely-uses-every-color-of-the-rainbow|title=Rihanna’s 'Rude Boy' Video Politely Uses Every Color Of The Rainbow|work=Idolator|publisher=Buzz Media|date=2010-02-10|accessdate=2011-09-20[/tpl] Bain said the video "is colorful, loud, vibrant, and a complete departure from the mostly depressing captivity scenarios and over-the-top war imagery of the previous videos from her Rated R singles." Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly[tpl]'[/tpl]s The Music-Mix, also commented on the vibrancy of the video and its resemblance to M.I.A.'s video, "It’s a wild explosion of clashing colors, bold block lettering, and shaky camerawork. As many observers instantly pointed out, it all owes more than a little to the aesthetic of M.I.A.—which, if you ask me, is not a bad thing at all."[tpl]cite news|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2010/02/11/rihanna-rude-boy-video/|title=Rihanna throws a crazy, colorful party in her 'Rude Boy' video: Watch it here|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time division of Time Warner|date=2010-02-11|accessdate=2011-09-20[/tpl] Jocelyn Vena of MTV commented on the change of visual direction in the video, writing "[tpl]'[/tpl]Rude Boy' is a colorful departure from the dark fare previously released from her Rated R album."
