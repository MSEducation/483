Danish film director Lars von Trier caused controversy with comments he made at the press conference of his film Melancholia. When he was asked about the relation between the influences of German Romanticism in the film and his own German heritage, the director made jokes about Jews and Nazis. He said he understood Adolf Hitler and admired the work of architect Albert Speer, and jokingly announced that he was a Nazi.[tpl]cite news|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|date=18 May 2011|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/may/18/lars-von-trier-cannes-2011-nazi-comments|title=Lars von Trier provokes Cannes with 'I'm a Nazi' comments|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=18 May 2011[/tpl] The Cannes Film Festival first issued an official apology for the remarks the same day and clarified that Trier is not a Nazi or an antisemite,[tpl]cite news|author=Staff writer|date=18 May 2011|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-film-festival-condemns-lars-189831|title=Cannes Film Festival Condemns Lars von Trier's Nazi Comments|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=18 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110522070035/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-film-festival-condemns-lars-189831| archivedate= 22 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] then declared the director "persona non grata" the following day.[tpl]cite news|author=Catherine Shoard|date=19 May 2011|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/may/19/cannes-film-festival-2011-lars-von-trier-banned|title=Cannes film festival bans Lars von Trier|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=19 May 2011[/tpl] The film remained in competition.[tpl]cite news|date=20 May 2011|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13457328|title=Lars Von Trier 'accepts' Cannes ban after Nazi comments|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110520003011/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13457328| archivedate= 20 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
