This is a list of Major Archbishops of Kiev-Galicia from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. 
Following the Union of Brest the Metropolia of Kiev-Halych and all Rus broke relations with the Patriarch of Constantinople and place themselves in communion with the Patriarch of the West, thus establishing what later was known as "Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church". At first widely successful, within several decades it had lost much of its initial support, mainly due to Imperial Russian persecution, though in Galicia the church fared well and remains strong to this day.

==Primates from 1807 to 2005==

In 1807 the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was split in order to separate the territories under the Russian Empire (Metropolia of Kiev) from the ones under the Habsburg Monarchy, thus elevating the Eparchy of Lviv to the rank of Metropolis and granting it the same rights of the Metropolis of Kiev. 
Metropolitans of Kiev from 1807 to 1838:
Following the Synod of Polatsk (1838) the Greek Catholic church was forcedly abolished on the territory of the Russian Empire, and its property and clergy transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church.
Metropolitans of Lviv from 1807 to 2005:
In 1963 the Metropolitan of Lviv was elevated to the rank of Major archbishop.

==Primates from 2005==
