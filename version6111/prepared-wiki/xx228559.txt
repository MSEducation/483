[[Ten Little Injuns]]

CATEGORIES: 1868 songs

"Ten Little Injuns" is a popular song written by Septimus Winner in 1868 for the minstrel trade. It was based on an 1850s minstrel skit about one John Brown whose Indian (referring to "Native American") boy grows from "one little Injun" into "ten little Injuns," and then back to one,—, "Reviews and Literary Notices", p. 770: "We are all familiar with that John Brown whom the minstrel has immortalized as being the possessor of a diminutive youth of the aboriginal American race, who in the course of the ditty, is multiplied from 'one little Injun' into 'ten little Injuns,' and who, in a succeeding stanza, by an ingenious amphisbænic process, is again reduced to the singular number." i.e.:Wilson, "John Brown's Ten Little Injuns"
