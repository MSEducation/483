Ancient Domains of Mystery, or ADOM, is a roguelike video game by Thomas Biskup first released in [tpl]vgy|1994[/tpl]. The player's aim is to stop the forces of Chaos that invade the world of Ancardia.
Like most roguelikes, ADOM uses ASCII graphics to represent the game world. It features a wilderness map that connects different types of dungeons. Most dungeons are randomly generated on first entering. Once visited, they — with the exception of the Infinite Dungeon — do not change when re-entered during play.
Since 2012, after a 9 year hiatus, development has been resumed by Thomas Biskup on ADOM as well as its successor ADOM II. (aka JADE)  Due to a crowdfunding campaign the latest versions are only available to those who participated, but version 1.2.0p20 has been made available for public download.

==Story==

ADOM takes place in the fictional world of Ancardia, in the mountainous Drakalor Chain. For 6,000 years, it has known relative peace, but recently reports have spread of the appearance of dangerous dungeons and frightening monsters. Khelavaster, a wise sage, discovers an ancient prophecy regarding the Coming of Chaos and propagates it to the peoples of the world. It speaks of a champion who will defend the world from the forces of Chaos in the Drakalor Chain. Hearing of this prophecy, many would-be heroes set out. The player assumes control of one such adventurer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adom.de/adom/story.php3|title=The Background Story: The Coming of Chaos|accessdate=2007-11-29|author=Biskup, Thomas|date=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071213102815/http://www.adom.de/adom/story.php3| archivedate= 13 December 2007| deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Gameplay==

ADOM presents an initial choice of one (male or female) player character from ten races and twenty character classes, the combination of which strongly affects gameplay, in both subtle and obvious ways. Among other traits, character development includes experience levels, statistics, and skills. Version 1.1.0 introduced a talent system,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.adom.de/adom/history.php3 |title=The ADOM Version History |accessdate=2007-11-29 |author=Biskup, Thomas |date= | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071213150755/http://www.adom.de/adom/history.php3| archivedate= 13 December 2007| deadurl= no[/tpl] allowing further customization of characters, based on a hierarchical system of prerequisites.
During adventures, a player is likely to explore many areas and complete multiple quests. Which quests are available may depend on character experience level or alignment (lawful, neutral, or chaotic). Alignment also affects NPC and deity interaction with the character.  How one solves a quest can also affect one's alignment, such that a chaotic character seeking redemption can eventually become lawful through his or her actions (or vice versa).
ADOM offers multiple ways of winning, which vary in difficulty. The regular ending that appeared first in ADOM development, consists of locating and closing the gate through which the chaos forces infiltrate the game world Ancardia. The player also has the option to enter the gate, providing access to special endings, which are generally considered more difficult to accomplish. ADOM's quest-centric, plot-driven structure owes as much to adventure games like Zork as to the hack-and-slash of sibling games like Angband.

===Corruption===

The forces of chaos that have infiltrated Ancardia corrupt both the surrounding landscape and occasionally the player's character, causing mutations, such as antennae or a tail growing on the PC (Player Character). Some mutations are helpful, while others make the game much harder; many have elements of both.  Players need to be resourceful and adaptable due to the randomness of these mutations.  While there are limited opportunities in the game to mitigate or remove corruption effects, taking too long to close the chaos gate causes the corruption rate to increase dramatically.  After becoming fully corrupted, the game ends, as the character has become a "writhing mass of primal chaos".  The chaotic ending requires the character to be almost fully corrupted.
Besides background corruption, some powerful chaotic artifacts can actually cause the character to become corrupted merely by carrying them.  Other, less powerful chaotic artifacts only corrupt when actively invoked or wielded.  Generally, most artifacts and magic items are safe to carry and use, and only the most powerful items affect corruption rates.

===Herbs===

Herbs growing on some levels can be used to provide great benefits to the player. The growth of the herbs follows a slight modification of Conway's Game of Life.  While any character can harvest these herbs to limited effect, characters with certain skills and class abilities have strong bonuses and can even plant their own herb seeds.  Besides herbs, characters can also collect plant seeds, either to donate to farmers (for a small alignment shift to law) or plant in dungeons, to grow trees (useful for making bridges or fletching).

===Smithing===

Players can improve their items through various methods, such as smithing or magical enhancement.  Similarly, many items can be damaged or destroyed as a result of combat or other hazards. While special artifacts can not be damaged or destroyed, they are also immune to any form of improvement.  This presents a unique dilemma to characters who specialize in smithing: should they use powerful artifacts or enhanced items of their own design?  It is possible for a patient, highly skilled smith to enhance weapons and armor to levels beyond that of most artifacts, but the time required can cause a character to suffer more corruptions.

===Monster Memory===

A "Monster Memory" records the character's (not the player's) knowledge about creatures in the game, becoming increasingly detailed as the player defeats more of each monster. Statistics such as hit points, experience value, and speed are revealed, with corresponding observed highs, lows, and averages. Besides the in-game statistics, fan-submitted descriptions of every monster in the game are presented, sometimes with hints on strengths and weaknesses.

===Difficulty===

No matter how powerful players get, there is always a way for them to die if they become careless.  In rare cases, instant deaths are possible from using cursed equipment or gaining the "doomed" intrinsic.  Some monsters have powerful abilities that need specific counters, necessitating a change in strategy from traditional roguelike games.  Some items have powerful effects on monsters. Undead beings are burnt to ash by holy symbols, and chaos beings are badly hurt by thrown potions of cure corruption.  Strengths and weaknesses are often revealed in the monster memory and through rumors.
Death of player characters is meant to be permanent. The game exits after saving, effectively limiting savefiles to one per character, and the savefile is erased upon loading.

==Development==

Development of ADOM started on July 12, 1994 and continued steadily since until November 20, 2002. Core development on the game stopped with the release of version 1.1.1. Beta-quality ports to Mac OS X of this version appeared in 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adom.de/misc/news.php3?show=83|title=ADOM 1.1.1 available for Macintosh users!|accessdate=2007-11-29|author=Biskup, Thomas|date=[/tpl] Plans for future versions have not been announced, yet a next-generation successor to ADOM, called JADE,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ancientdomainsofmystery.com|title=JADE: Java-based Ancient Domains Engine|accessdate=2011-11-14|author=Biskup, Thomas|date=[/tpl] is in development and betas have been released. The developer has renamed the following game to ADOM II, leaving JADE as a game engine name.
On the 2nd of July 2012 a crowd funding campaign was initiated by Thomas Biskup to resurrect ADOM development. The campaign reached its initial goal of $48,000 on the 22nd of August, 2012, 51 days after starting, and finished at $90,169.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.indiegogo.com/resurrect-adom-development|title=Resurrect ADOM development|accessdate=2012-09-31[/tpl]
Although ADOM is available free of charge, in difference to most roguelikes its source code is unavailable. Despite earlier announcing that the source code would be published after the release of version 1.0,[tpl]cite web |url=http://rpgvaultarchive.ign.com/features/interviews/adom.shtml |title=ADOM Interview |accessdate=2011-01-11 |author=IGN |date=1998-05-06 [/tpl] Biskup later chose to reserve it for himself in order to retain some mystery about game operation and to curtail the spread of unsanctioned variants.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.adom.de/adom/readme1st.php3 |title=The ADOM Fluff FAQ |accessdate=2007-11-29 |author=Biskup, Thomas |date= | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071213102755/http://www.adom.de/adom/readme1st.php3| archivedate= 13 December 2007| deadurl= no[/tpl] Despite this stance, he is open to licensing the source to capable developers to form a commercial venture. Players meanwhile have deduced underlying mechanisms through careful experimentation and reverse-engineering by inspecting the execution flow, memory and binaries of the game, although this is something Biskup disrespects.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]
Despite Biskup's decision to not publish the source code to ADOM, he states in his blog (accessible on the official ADOM website) that he may be ready to reconsider his decision. In a post discussing possible events of the year 2009, he states that it is unlikely that he will work on ADOM any time soon, and is willing to discuss possible release models with the community. Thus, Biskup has dedicated a subforum on the official ADOM forums for the discussion of this matter.

==Reception==

ADOM has established a strong fan base that started gathering since 1997 at Usenet group rec.games.roguelike.adom, sporting 2000-3000 messages monthly regularly in years of active development, although lately the activity has been ceasing.rec.games.roguelike.adom — About this group at Google Groups
Given that ADOM was a long-lasting development effort and new versions of the game were regularly released over the years,ADOM - Archive lists most of the versions released since 1994 ADOM has received many critical reviews over many varied versions. The overall critical reception is good.
Reviewers usually compare ADOM to other roguelike games (like Rogue, Angband or Moria) and find that ADOM offers a much deeper storyline, more manifold environment, and is generally more complex. Most note that ADOM offers very high replay value and general randomness of events that happen in the game. Overall game system design (and especially the character development system) is usually praised for its flexibility. Some reviews note low hardware requirements and freeware distribution as essential advantages.
As for downsides, there is no universal agreement. The user interface is cited to have high learning curve by some critics, while others note that it is "brilliant in its simplicity", "very practical" and "easy to navigate". Keyboard controls imply usage of the numeric keypad which makes ADOM relatively hard to play on keyboards without keypads (i.e. laptops). Discussing gameplay, the same complexity and randomness that were cited as positive features are sometimes said to make ADOM very difficult for beginning players. Most reviewers agree that ADOM may be very hard to play for beginners due to the deletion of savefiles, which is uncommon for games outside the roguelike genre.
