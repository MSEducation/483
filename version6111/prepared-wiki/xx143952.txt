==History==

===Sunset Station===

Amtrak previously utilized the historic Southern Pacific Railroad Station, that was also known as the Sunset Station. It was designed by SP's architect Daniel J. Patterson in the Spanish Mission Revival style, and built in 1902 by the SP.  The train station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.  
Amtrak moved operations in 1998 to a smaller depot that was built adjacent to the older Sunset Station.  Under its owner, VIA Metropolitan Transit, the historic Sunset Station underwent an extensive restoration and now serves as an entertainment complex.  The station also neighbors the Alamodome. There is even a preserved 2-8-2 Baldwin "Mikado" steam locomotive that had belonged to the Southern Pacific railroad, was donated to the City of San Antonio at the end of its service life in 1956, and placed on static display at nearby Maverick Park for many years before being relocated to the station.  Another "Mikado", donated simultaneously to the City of Austin, is operated on excursion trains for live steam enthusiasts by the Austin Steam Train Association.
