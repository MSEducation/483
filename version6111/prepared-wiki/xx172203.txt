Glannoventa or Glannaventa is believed to have been the Latin name of the Roman fort and naval base at Ravenglass, Cumbria, England.[tpl]cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/89193 |title=Places: 89193 (*Glannoventa) |author=Esmonde Cleary, A., R.

There is evidence for the name of an infantry unit of the Roman army, based at Ravenglass.  This was the First Cohort Aelia Classica, who were apparently at the fort in the year 158. ‘Aelius’ was the family name of the Emperor Hadrian, while ‘Classica’ is derived from the Latin classis, meaning ‘fleet’, suggesting that the soldiers were recruited from the fleet in Hadrian’s time (117 to 138).History and Research: Ravenglass Roman Bath House,
