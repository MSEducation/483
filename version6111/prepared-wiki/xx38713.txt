The situation is further complicated when considering fusion in vivo since biological fusion is almost always regulated by the action of membrane-associated proteins. The first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins, which allow an enveloped virus to insert its genetic material into the host cell (enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer; some others have only a protein coat). Eukaryotic cells also use fusion proteins, the best-studied of which are the SNAREs. SNARE proteins are used to direct all vesicular intracellular trafficking. Despite years of study, much is still unknown about the function of this protein class. In fact, there is still an active debate regarding whether SNAREs are linked to early docking or participate later in the fusion process by facilitating hemifusion.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chen YA, Scheller RH |title=SNARE-mediated membrane fusion |journal=Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=98–106 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11252968 |doi=10.1038/35052017 [/tpl]
In studies of molecular and cellular biology it is often desirable to artificially induce fusion. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption. This procedure is now used extensively, for example by fusing B-cells with melanoma cells.[tpl]cite journal |author=Köhler G, Milstein C |title=Continuous cultures of fused cells secreting antibody of predefined specificity |journal=Nature |volume=256 |issue=5517 |pages=495–7 |date=August 1975 |pmid=1172191 |doi=10.1038/256495a0 |bibcode=1975Natur.256..495K[/tpl] The resulting “hybridoma” from this combination expresses a desired antibody as determined by the B-cell involved, but is immortalized due to the melanoma component. Fusion can also be artificially induced through electroporation in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the energetically active edges formed during electroporation, which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers.[tpl]cite book |author=Jordan, Carol A.; Neumann, Eberhard; Sowershi mason, Arthur E. |title=Electroporation and electrofusion in cell biology |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |year=1989 |isbn=0-306-43043-6 [/tpl]

==Model systems==

Lipid bilayers can be created artificially in the lab to allow researchers to perform experiments that cannot be done with natural bilayers. These synthetic systems are called model lipid bilayers. There are many different types of model bilayers, each having experimental advantages and disadvantages. They can be made with either synthetic or natural lipids. Among the most common model systems are:

==Commercial applications==

To date, the most successful commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the target site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.[tpl]cite journal |author=Immordino ML, Dosio F, Cattel L |title=Stealth liposomes: review of the basic science, rationale, and clinical applications, existing and potential |journal=Int J Nanomedicine |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=297–315 |year=2006 |pmid=17717971 |pmc=2426795 |doi=10.2217/17435889.1.3.297 [/tpl]
The first generation of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both renal clearing and phagocytosis. Refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity, surface charge density, and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chonn A, Semple SC, Cullis PR |title=Association of blood proteins with large unilamellar liposomes in vivo. Relation to circulation lifetimes |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=267 |issue=26 |pages=18759–65 |date=15 September 1992|pmid=1527006 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1527006 [/tpl] The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the liposome surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.[tpl]cite journal |author=Boris EH, Winterhalter M, Frederik PM, Vallner JJ, Lasic DD |title=Stealth liposomes: from theory to product |journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews |volume=24 |issue= 2–3|pages=165–77 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0169-409X(96)00456-5[/tpl]
The first stealth liposomes were passively targeted at tumor tissues. Because tumors induce rapid and uncontrolled angiogenesis they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes to exit the bloodstream at a much higher rate than normal tissue would.[tpl]cite journal |author=Maeda H, Sawa T, Konno T |title=Mechanism of tumor-targeted delivery of macromolecular drugs, including the EPR effect in solid tumor and clinical overview of the prototype polymeric drug SMANCS |journal=J Control Release |volume=74 |issue=1–3 |pages=47–61 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11489482 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168365901003091 |doi=10.1016/S0168-3659(01)00309-1[/tpl] More recently[tpl]when|date=January 2011[/tpl] work has been undertaken to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lopes DE, Menezes DE, Kirchmeier MJ, Gagne JF |title=Cellular trafficking and cytotoxicity of anti-CD19-targeted liposomal doxorubicin in B lymphoma cells |journal=Journal of Liposome Research |volume=9 |issue= 2|pages=199–228 |year=1999 |doi=10.3109/08982109909024786[/tpl] Some examples of this approach are already in clinical trials.[tpl]cite journal |author=Matsumura Y, Gotoh M, Muro K, et al. |title=Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of MCC-465, a doxorubicin (DXR) encapsulated in PEG immunoliposome, in patients with metastatic stomach cancer |journal=Ann.

Another potential application of lipid bilayers is the field of biosensors. Since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, it is also the site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore Life Sciences, which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kineticsBiacore A100 System Information. Biacore Inc. Retrieved Feb 12, 2009. and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system.Nanion Technologies. Automated Patch Clamp. Retrieved Feb 28, 2010. (PDF) Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued such as the use of lipid bilayer membrane pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.
A supported lipid bilayer (SLB) as described above has achieved commercial success as a screening technique to measure the permeability of drugs. This parallel artificial membrane permeability assay PAMPA technique measures the permeability across specifically formulated lipid cocktail(s) found to be highly correlated with Caco-2 cultures,Bermejo, M. et al.

==History==

By the early twentieth century scientists had come to believe that cells are surrounded by a thin oil-like barrier,[tpl]cite journal |author=Loeb J |title=The recent development of Biology |journal=Science |volume=20 |issue=519 |pages=777–786 |date=December 1904 |pmid=17730464 |doi=10.1126/science.20.519.777 |bibcode = 1904Sci....20..777L [/tpl] but the structural nature of this membrane was not known. Two experiments in 1925 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions, Hugo Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3 nm thick.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fricke H |title=The electrical capacity of suspensions with special reference to blood |journal=Journal of General Physiology |volume=9 |issue= 2|pages=137–52 |year=1925 |pmid=19872238 |pmc=2140799 |doi=10.1085/jgp.9.2.137[/tpl]
Although the results of this experiment were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter[tpl]cite journal |author=Dooren L J, Wiedemann L R |title=On bimolecular layers of lipids on the chromocytes of the blood |journal=Journal of European Journal of Pediatrics |volume=145 |issue=5 |pages=329 |year=1986 |doi=10.1007/BF00439232[/tpl] (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gorter E, Grendel F |title=On bimolecular layers of lipids on the chromocytes of the blood |journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=41 |issue= 4|pages=439–43 |year=1925 |pmid=19868999 |pmc=2130960 |doi=10.1084/jem.41.4.439[/tpl] Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.[tpl]cite book |author=Yeagle, Philip |title=The membranes of cells |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1993 |edition=2nd |isbn=0-12-769041-7 [/tpl]
This theory was confirmed through the use of electron microscopy in the late 1950s. Although he did not publish the first electron microscopy study of lipid bilayers[tpl]cite journal |author=Sjöstrand FS, Andersson-Cedergren E, Dewey MM |title=The ultrastructure of the intercalated discs of frog, mouse and guinea pig cardiac muscle |journal=J. Ultrastruct. Res. |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=271–87 |date=April 1958 |pmid=13550367 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5320(58)80008-8 [/tpl] J. David Robertson was the first to assert that the two dark electron-dense bands were the headgroups and associated proteins of two apposed lipid monolayers.[tpl]cite journal |author=Robertson JD |title=The molecular structure and contact relationships of cell membranes |journal=Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. |volume=10 |issue= |pages=343–418 |year=1960 |pmid=13742209 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Robertson JD |title=The ultrastructure of cell membranes and their derivatives |journal=Biochem. Soc. Symp. |volume=16 |issue= |pages=3–43 |year=1959 |pmid=13651159 [/tpl] In this body of work, Robertson put forward the concept of the “unit membrane.” This was the first time the bilayer structure had been universally assigned to all cell membranes as well as organelle membranes.
Around the same time, the development of model membranes confirmed that the lipid bilayer is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins. By “painting” a solution of lipid in organic solvent across an aperture, Mueller and Rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity, high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture,[tpl]cite journal |author=Mueller P, Rudin DO, Tien HT, Wescott WC |title=Reconstitution of cell membrane structure in vitro and its transformation into an excitable system |journal=Nature |volume=194 |issue= 4832|pages=979–80 |date=June 1962 |pmid=14476933 |doi=10.1038/194979a0 |bibcode = 1962Natur.194..979M [/tpl] all of which properties of a natural cell membrane. A few years later, Alec Bangham showed that bilayers, in the form of lipid vesicles, could also be formed simply by exposing a dried lipid sample to water.[tpl]cite pmid|14187392[/tpl] This was an important advance, since it demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned support structure.
