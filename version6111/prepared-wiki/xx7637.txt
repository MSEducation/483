The Ice Maiden has been a source of some recent controversy. The mummy's skin has suffered some slight decay, and the tattoos have faded since the excavation. Some residents of the Altai Republic, formed after the breakup of the Soviet Union, have requested the return of the Ice Maiden, who is currently stored in Novosibirsk in Siberia.[tpl]cite journal | last = Polosmak | first = Natalya | title = A Mummy Unearthed from the Pastures of Heaven  | journal =National Geographic Magazine | pages=80–103| year = 1994[/tpl]
Another Siberian mummy, a man, was discovered much earlier in 1929. His skin was also marked with tattoos of two monsters resembling griffins, which decorated his chest, and three partially obliterated images which seem to represent two deer and a mountain goat on his left arm.

===Europe===

The European continent is home to a diverse spectrum of spontaneous and anthropogenic mummies. Some of the best-preserved mummies have come from bogs located across the region. The Capuchin monks that inhabited the area left behind hundreds of intentionally-preserved bodies that have provided insight into the customs and cultures of people from various eras. One of the oldest, and most infamous, mummies (nicknamed Ötzi) was discovered on this continent. New mummies continue to be uncovered in Europe well into the 21st Century.

====Bog bodies====

The United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark have produced a number of bog bodies, mummies of people deposited in sphagnum bogs, apparently as a result of murder or ritual sacrifices. In such cases, the acidity of the water, low temperature and lack of oxygen combined to tan the body's skin and soft tissues. The skeleton typically disintegrates over time. Such mummies are remarkably well preserved on emerging from the bog, with skin and internal organs intact; it is even possible to determine the decedent's last meal by examining stomach contents. A famous case is that of the Haraldskær Woman, who was discovered by labourers in a bog in Jutland in 1835. She was erroneously identified as an early medieval Danish queen, and for that reason was placed in a royal sarcophagus at the Saint Nicolai Church, Vejle, where she currently remains. Another famous bog body, also from Denmark, known as the Tollund Man was discovered in 1950. The corpse was noted for its excellent preservation of the face and feet, which appeared as if the man had recently died. To this day, only the head of Tollund Man remains, due to the decomposition of the rest of his body, which was not preserved along with the head.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.tollundman.dk/et-lig-dukker-op.asp|title=A Body Appears|work=The Tollund Man - A Face from Prehistoric Denmark|accessdate=22 September 2007|publisher=Silkeborg Public Library|year=2004|author=Silkeborg Public Library, Silkeborg Museum[/tpl]

====Canary Islands====

The mummies of the Canary Islands belong to the indigenous Guanche people and date to the time before 14th Century Spanish explorers settled in the area. All deceased people within the Guanche culture were mummified during this time, though the level of care taken with embalming and burial varied depending on individual social status. Embalming was carried out by specialized groups, organized according to gender, who were considered unclean by the rest of the community. The techniques for embalming were similar to those of the Ancient Egyptians; involving evisceration, preservation, and stuffing of the evacuated bodily cavities, then wrapping of the body in animal skins. Despite the successful techniques utilized by the Guanche, very few mummies remain due to looting and desecration.[tpl]cite journal|last=Horne|first=Patrick|coauthors=Robert Ireland|title=Moss and a Guanche Mummy: An Unusual Utilization|journal=The Bryologist|year=1991|volume=94|issue=4|page=407|jstor=3243832|publisher=American Bryological and Lichenological Society[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Cockburn|first=Aidan|title=Mummies, Disease and Ancient Cultures|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=University Press, Cambridge, UK|page=284|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8KZHa5vHOS0C&pg=PA263&dq=Guanche+mummies#v=onepage&q=Guanche%20mummies&f=false|edition=Second|coauthors=Eve Cockburn & Theodore A.

====Czech Republic====

The majority of mummies recovered in the Czech Republic come from underground crypts. While there is some evidence of deliberate mummification, most sources state that desiccation occurred naturally due to unique conditions within the crypts.[tpl]sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=192[/tpl]
The Capuchin Crypt in Brno contains three hundred years of mummified remains directly below the main altar.[tpl]cite web|title=MUMMIES and MUMMIFIED REMAINS|url=http://www.orchestrion.cz/mummy.htm|accessdate=11 November 2013[/tpl] Beginning in the 18th Century when the crypt was opened, and continuing until the practice was discontinued in 1787, the Capuchin monks of the monastery would lay the deceased on a pillow of bricks on the ground. The unique air quality and topsoil within the crypt naturally preserved the bodies over time.[tpl]cite web|title=The Czech's Capuchin Crypt|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/czechs-capuchin-crypt|accessdate=11 November 2013[/tpl]
Approximately fifty mummies were discovered in an abandoned crypt beneath the Church of St. Procopius of Sázava in Vamberk in the mid-1980s.[tpl]cite web|title=Monastery of Broumov|url=http://www.broumovsko.cz/en/monastery-of-broumov/monastery-of-broumov|publisher=Agentura pro rozvoj Broumovska|accessdate=11 November 2013[/tpl]  Workers digging a trench accidentally broke into the crypt, which began to fill with waste water. The mummies quickly began to deteriorate, though thirty-four were able to be rescued and stored temporarily at the District Museum of the Orlické Mountains until they could be returned to the monastery in 2000. The mummies range in age and social status at time of death, with at least two children and one priest. The majority of the Vamberk mummies date from the 18th century.
The Klatovy catacombs currently house an exhibition of Jesuit mummies, alongside some aristocrats, that were originally interred between 1674-1783. In the early 1930s, the mummies were accidentally damaged during repairs, resulting in the loss of 140 bodies. The newly updated airing system preserves the thirty-eight bodies that are currently on display.[tpl]cite web|title=New exposition|url=http://www.katakomby.cz/klatovycatacombs/newexposition.aspx|publisher=Klatovské katakomby|accessdate=11 November 2013[/tpl]

====Denmark====

Apart from several bog bodies, Denmark has also yielded several other mummies, such as the three Borum Eshøj mummies, the Skrydstrup Woman and the Egtved Girl, who were all found inside burial mounds, or tumulus.
In 1875, the Borum Eshøj grave mound was uncovered, which had been built around three coffins, which belonged to a middle aged man and woman as well as a man in his early twenties. Through examination, the woman was discovered to be around 50–60 years old. She was found with several artifacts made of bronze, consisting of buttons, a belt plate, and rings, showing she was of higher class. All of the hair had been removed from the skull later when farmers had dug through the casket. Her original hairstyle is unknown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://oldtiden.natmus.dk/udstillingen/bronzealderen/familien_i_borum_eshoej/kvinden_fra_borum_eshoej/language/uk/ |title=The woman from Borum Eshøj – Oldtiden |publisher=Oldtiden.natmus.dk |accessdate=11 November 2013[/tpl] The two men wore kilts, and the younger man wore a sheath of which contained a bronze dagger.

The Skrydstrup Woman was unearthed from a tumulus in Southern Jutland, in 1935. Carbon-14 dating showed that she had died around 1300 BCE; examination also revealed that she was around 18–19 years old at the time of death, and that she had been buried in the summertime. Her hair had been drawn up in an elaborate hairstyle, which was then covered by a horse hair hairnet made by sprang technique. She was wearing a blouse and a necklace as well as two golden earrings, showing she was of higher class.[tpl]cite web|last=Kaul |first=Flemming |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/en_GB/skrydstrup |title=Skrydstrup, We know where she lived – 1001 Stories of Denmark |publisher=Kulturarv.dk |accessdate=11 November 2013[/tpl]
The Egtved Girl, dated to 1370 BCE, was found also inside a sealed coffin inside of a tumulus, in 1921. She was wearing a bodice and a skirt, including a belt and bronze bracelets. Also found with the girl were the cremated remains of a child at her feet, and by her head a box containing some bronze pins, a hairnet, and an awl.Hogan, C.

====Hungary====

In 1994, 265 mummified bodies were found in the crypt of a Dominican church in Vác, Hungary from the 1729–1838 period. The discovery proved to be scientifically important, and by 2006 an exhibition was established in the Museum of Natural History in Budapest. Unique to the Hungarian mummies are their elaborately decorated coffins, with no two being exactly alike.[tpl]cite web|title=MUMMIES OF VÁC, HUNGARY|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mummies-v-c-hungary|publisher=AtlasObscura|accessdate=12 November 2013[/tpl]

====Italy====

The varied geography and climatology of Italy has led to many cases of spontaneous mummification.[tpl]sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=193[/tpl] Italian mummies display the same diversity, with a conglomeration of natural and intentional mummification spread across many centuries and cultures.
The oldest natural mummy in Europe was discovered in 1991 in the Ötztal Alps on the Austrian-Italian border. Nicknamed Ötzi, the mummy is a 5,300 year-old male believed to be a member of the Tamins-Carasso-Isera cultural group of South Tyrol.[tpl]cite web|last=Owen|first=James|title=5 Surprising Facts About Otzi the Iceman|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131016-otzi-ice-man-mummy-five-facts/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=16 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Which cultural group did Ötzi belong to?|url=http://www.iceman.it/en/node/295|publisher=South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology|accessdate=11 November 2013[/tpl] Despite his age, a recent DNA study conducted by Walther Parson of Innsbruck Medical University revealed Ötzi has 19 living genetic relatives.
The Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo were built in the 16th century by the monks of Palermo’s Capuchin monastery. Originally intended to hold the deliberately mummified remains of dead friars, internment in the catacombs became a status symbol for the local population in the following centuries. Burials continued until the 1920s, with one of the most famous final burials being that of Rosalia Lombardo. In all, the catacombs host nearly 8000 mummies. (See: Catacombe dei Cappuccini)
The most recent discovery of mummies in Italy came in 2010, when sixty mummified human remains were found in the crypt of the Conversion of St Paul church in Roccapelago di Pievepelago, Italy. Built in the 15th Century as a cannon hold and later converted in the 16th Century, the crypt had been sealed once it had reached capacity, leaving the bodies to be protected and preserved. The crypt was reopened during restoration work on the church, revealing the diverse array of mummies inside. The bodies were quickly moved to a museum for further study.[tpl]cite web|title=Dr Stefano Vanin’s forensic expertise is used to learn lessons from the extraordinary Mummies of Roccapelago|url=http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/aaarg/projects/the-mummies-of-roccapelago/|publisher=University of Huddersfield|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=24 July 2013[/tpl]

===North America===

The mummies of North America are often steeped in controversy, as many of these bodies have been linked to still-existing native cultures. While the mummies provide a wealth of historically-significant data, native cultures and tradition often demands the remains be returned to their original resting places. This has led to many legal actions by Native American councils, leading to most museums keeping mummified remains out of the public eye.

====Canada====

Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi ("Long ago person found" in the Southern Tutchone language of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations), was found in August 1999 by three First Nations hunters at the edge of a glacier in Tatshenshini-Alsek Park, British Columbia, Canada.  According to the Kwäday Dän Ts'ìnchi Project, the remains are the oldest well preserved mummy discovered in North America.[tpl]cite web|title=Kwäday Dän Ts'ìnchi Project Introduction|url=http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/archaeology/kwaday_dan_tsinchi/project_introduction.htm|publisher=Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resources Operations|accessdate=12 November 2013[/tpl] (It should be noted that  the Spirit Cave mummy although not well preserved, is much older.)[tpl]cite web|last=Muska|first=D.

====Greenland====

In 1972, eight remarkably preserved mummies were discovered at an abandoned Inuit settlement called Qilakitsoq, in Greenland. The "Greenland Mummies" consisted of a six-month-old baby, a four-year-old boy, and six women of various ages, who died around 500 years ago. Their bodies were naturally mummified by the sub-zero temperatures and dry winds in the cave in which they were found.[tpl]cite web | last = Deem | first = James M. | title = World Mummies: Greenland Mummies | url = http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/greenland.htm | publisher = Mummy Tombs | date = 2007-03-15 | accessdate =16 March 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Hart Hansen | first = Jens Peder | coauthors = Jørgen Meldgaard; Jørgen Nordqvist (eds.) | title = The Greenland Mummies | location = London | publisher=British Museum Publications | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-7141-2500-8[/tpl]

====Mexico====

Intentional mummification in pre-Columbian Mexico was practiced by the Aztec culture. These bodies are collectively known as Aztec mummies. Genuine Aztec mummies were "bundled" in a woven wrap and often had their faces covered by a ceremonial mask.[tpl]cite web|last=Langely|first=James|title=NOTES I-3: TEOTIHUACAN INCENSARIOS: THE 'V' MANTA AND ITS MESSAGE|url=http://archaeology.asu.edu/teo/notes/JL/notes1_3.htm|publisher=Internet Journal for Teotihuacan Archaeology and Iconography|accessdate=12 November 2013[/tpl] Public knowledge of Aztec mummies increased due to traveling exhibits and museums in the 19th and 20th centuries, though these bodies were typically naturally desiccated remains and not actually the mummies associated with Aztec culture. (See: Aztec mummy)
Natural mummification has been known to occur in several places in Mexico, though the most famous are the mummies of Guanajuato.[tpl]cite news |title= Professor unravels secrets of the Guanajuato mummies |newspaper=US Fed News Service, Including US State News |location=Washington, D.C. |date=30 August 2007[/tpl] A collection of these mummies, most of which date to the late 19th century, have been on display at El Museo de las Momias in the city of Guanajuato since 1970. The museum claims to have the smallest mummy in the world on display (a mummified fetus).[tpl]cite book |title= Guanajuato: Guia para descubrir los encantos del estado|editor= Jimenez Gonzalez, Victor Manuel |isbn=978-607-400-177-8 |year=2009 |publisher=Solaris |location=Madrid, Spain |language= Spanish |page=103[/tpl]  It was thought that minerals in the soil had the preserving effect, however it may rather be due to the warm, arid climate.[tpl]cite news |title= Detroit Science Center: The Accidental Mummies of Guanajuato Touring Exhibition to Make World Debut in Detroit |newspaper=Pediatrics Week.  |location=Atlanta |date=27 June 2009 |page=97[/tpl]  Mexican mummies are also on display in the small town of Encarnación de Díaz, Jalisco.

====United States====

Spirit Cave man was discovered in 1940 during salvage work prior to guano mining activity that was scheduled to begin in the area. The mummy is a middle-aged male, found completely dressed and lying on a blanket made of animal skin. Radiocarbon tests in the 1990s dated the mummy to being nearly 9,000 years old. The remains are currently held at the Nevada State Museum. There has been some controversy within the local Native American community, who began petitioning to have the remains returned and reburied in 1995.[tpl]cite web|title=Spirit Cave Man|url=http://museums.nevadaculture.org/new_exhibits/cc-UnderOneSky/spiritcave.htm|publisher=Nevada State Museum|accessdate=12 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Asher|first=Laura|title=Oldest North American Mummy|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/9609/newsbriefs/nevada.html|work=Archaeology|publisher=Archaeological Institute of America|accessdate=12 November 2013|year=1996[/tpl]

===Oceania===

Mummies from the Oceania are not limited only to Australia. Discoveries of mummified remains have also been located in New Zealand, and the Torres Strait,[tpl]sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=289[/tpl] though these mummies have been historically harder to examine and classify.[tpl]sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=277[/tpl] Prior to the 20th Century, most literature on mummification in the region was either silent or anecdotal. However, the boom of interest generated by the scientific study of Egyptian mummification lead to more concentrated study of mummies in other cultures, including the Oceania.

====Australia====

The aboriginal mummification traditions found in Australia are thought be related to those found in the Torres Strait islands,[tpl]cite journal|last=Dawson|first=Warren|title=Mummification in Australia and in America|journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|year=1928|volume=58|pages=115–138|jstor=4619529[/tpl] the inhabitants of which achieved a high level of sophisticated mummification techniques (See:Torres Strait). Australian mummies lack some of the technical ability of the Torres Strait mummies, however much of the ritual aspects of the mummification process are similar. Full-body mummification was achieved by these cultures, but not the level of artistic preservation as found on smaller islands. The reason for this seems to be for easier transport of bodies by more nomadic tribes.

====Torres Strait====

The mummies of the Torres Strait have a considerably higher level of preservation technique as well as creativity compared to those found on Australia. The process began with removal of viscera, afterwhich the bodies were set in a seated position on a platform and either left to dry in the sun or smoked over a fire in order to aid in desiccation. In the case of smoking, some tribes would collect the fat that drained from the body to mix with ocher to create red paint that would then be smeared back on the skin of the mummy.[tpl]cite web|last=Deem|first=James|title=Melanesia Mummies|url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/melanesia.htm|accessdate=15 November 2013[/tpl] The mummies remained on the platforms, decorated with the clothing and jewelry they wore in life, before being buried.

====New Zealand====

Some Māori tribes from New Zealand would keep mummified heads as trophies from tribal warfare. They are also known as Mokomokai. In the 19th Century, many of the trophies were acquired by Europeans who found the tattooed skin to be a phenomenal curiosity. Westerners began to offer valuable commodities in exchange for the uniquely tattooed mummified heads. The heads were later put on display in museums, 16 of which being housed across France alone. In 2010, the Rouen City Hall of France returned one of the heads to New Zealand, despite earlier protests by the Culture Ministry of France.[tpl]cite web|title=Mummified Maori head returned to NZ|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/mummified-maori-head-returned-to-nz-after-136-years.htm|publisher=Australian Geographic|accessdate=13 November 2013|date=10 May 2011[/tpl]
There is also evidence that some Maori tribes may have practiced full-body mummification, though the practice is not thought to have been widespread.[tpl]cite journal|last=Orchiston|first=D. Wayne|title=THE PRACTICE OF MUMMIFICATION AMONG THE NEW ZEALAND MAORI|journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society|year=1968|volume=77|issue=2|pages=186–190|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_77_1968/Volume_77,_No._2/The_practice_of_mummification_among_the_New_Zealand_Maori,_by_Wayne_Orchiston,_p_186_-_190/p1|accessdate=13 November 2013[/tpl] The discussion of Maori mummification has been historically controversial, with some experts in past decades claiming that such mummies have never existed.[tpl]cite journal|last=Tregear|first=Edward|title=Maori Mummies|journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society|year=1916|volume=25|issue=100|pages=167–168|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/?wid=1053|accessdate=13 November 2013[/tpl] Contemporary science does now acknowledge the existence of full-body mummification in the culture. There is still controversy, however, as to the nature of the mummification process. Some bodies appear to be spontaneously created by the natural environment, while others exhibit signs of deliberate practices. General modern consensus tends to agree that there could be a mixture of both types of mummification, similar to that of the Ancient Egyptian mummies.

===South America===

The South American continent contains some of the oldest mummies in the world, both deliberate and accidental. The bodies were preserved by the best agent for mummification: the environment. Rather than developing elaborate processes such as later-dynasty Ancient Egyptians, the early South Americans often left their dead in naturally dry or frozen areas, though some did perform surgical preparation when mummification was intentional.[ref]

====Chinchorro Mummies====

The Chinchorro mummies are the oldest intentionally prepared mummified bodies ever found. Beginning in 5th millennium BCE and continuing for an estimated 3,500 years, all human burials within the Chinchorro culture were prepared for mummification. The bodies were carefully prepared, beginning with removal of the internal organs and skin, before being left in the hot, dry climate of the Atacama Desert, which aided in desiccation. A large number of Chinchorro mummies were also prepared by skilled artisans to be preserved in a more artistic fashion, though the purpose of this practice is widely debated.

====Inca Mummies====

Several naturally-preserved, unintentional mummies dating from the Incan period have been found in the colder regions of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. These are collectively known as "ice mummies". The first Incan ice mummy was discovered in 1954 atop El Plomo Peak in Chile, after an eruption of the nearby volcano Sabancaya melted away ice that covered the body.[ref]
