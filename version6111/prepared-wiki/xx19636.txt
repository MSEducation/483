The Strait of Juan de Fuca (officially named Juan de Fuca Strait in Canada[tpl]Cite bcgnis|id=25888 |title=Juan de Fuca Strait[/tpl]) is a large body of water about [tpl]convert|95|mi|km[/tpl] long[tpl]gnis|1526614|Strait of Juan de Fuca[/tpl] that is the Salish Sea outlet to the Pacific Ocean. The international boundary between Canada and the United States  runs down the center of the Strait.
It was named in 1787 by the maritime fur trader Charles William Barkley, captain of the Imperial Eagle, for Juan de Fuca, the Greek navigator who sailed in a Spanish expedition in 1592 to seek the fabled Strait of Anián. Barkley was the first non-indigenous person to find the strait, unless Juan de Fuca's story was true.While [tpl]gnis|1526614|Strait of Juan de Fuca[/tpl] says John Meares named the strait in 1788, most sources say it was Barkley in 1787, for example: [tpl]Cite bcgnis|id=25888 |title=Juan de Fuca Strait[/tpl]; Existence of the Strait of Juan de Fuca confirmed by Captain Charles Barkley, Washington Secretary of State; [tpl]cite book |last= Hayes |first= Derek |title= Historical Atlas of the Pacific Northwest: Maps of exploration and Discovery |year= 1999 |publisher= Sasquatch Books |isbn= 1-57061-215-3|pages= 16[/tpl] online at Google Books; and [tpl]cite book |last= Pethick |first= Derek |title= The Nootka Connection: Europe and the Northwest Coast 1790-1795 |year= 1980 |publisher= Douglas & McIntyre |location= Vancouver |isbn= 0-88894-279-6 |pages= 24[/tpl] It is well established that Meares tried to take credit for much of Barkley's work. The strait was explored in detail between 1789 and 1791 by Manuel Quimper, José María Narváez, Juan Carrasco, Gonzalo López de Haro, and Francisco de Eliza.

==Definition==

The USGS defines the Strait of Juan de Fuca as a channel.  It extends east from the Pacific Ocean between Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, to Haro Strait, San Juan Channel, Rosario Strait, and Puget Sound.  The Pacific Ocean boundary is formed by a line between Cape Flattery and Tatoosh Island, Washington, and Carmanah Point (Vancouver Island), British Columbia. Its northern boundary follows the shoreline of Vancouver Island from Carmanah Point to Gonzales Point, then follows a continuous line east to Seabird Point (Discovery Island), British Columbia, Cattle Point (San Juan Island), Washington, Iceberg Point (Lopez Island), Point Colville (Lopez Island), and then to Rosario Head (Fidalgo Island). The eastern boundary runs south from Rosario Head across Deception Pass to Whidbey Island, then along the western coast of Whidbey Island to Point Partridge, then across Admiralty Inlet to Point Wilson (Quimper Peninsula). The northern coast of the Olympic Peninsula  forms the southern boundary of the strait. In the eastern entrance to the Strait, the Race Rocks Archipelago is located in the high current zone half way between Port Angeles, Washington, and Victoria, BC.

==Climate==

Like the rest of the Salish Sea and surrounding regions, the climate of the Strait is disputed, with the Köppen system classifying it as Mediterranean, but most regional climatologists preferring oceanic. While the climate is mostly oceanic in nature, the dry summers result in the Mediterranean classification in the Köppen system. Rainfall ranges from over [tpl]convert|100|in|cm[/tpl] (temperate rainforest) conditions at the west end to as little as [tpl]convert|16|in|cm[/tpl] at the east end, near Sequim.[tpl]cite web|title=SEQUIM 2 E, WASHINGTON|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?wa7544[/tpl]  
Because it is exposed to the generally westerly winds and waves of the Pacific, seas and weather in Juan de Fuca Strait are, on average, rougher than in the more protected waters inland, thereby resulting in a number of small-craft advisories.

==Ferries==

An international vehicle ferry crosses the Strait from Port Angeles, Washington to Victoria, British Columbia several times each day, as do passenger ferries of the Washington State Ferry system, a seasonal private ferry connecting Port Angeles with Victoria and a private high-speed ferry between Victoria and Seattle.

==Boundary dispute==

The dispute is only over the seaward boundary extending [tpl]convert|200|mi|km[/tpl] west from the mouth of the strait. The maritime boundary within the strait is not in dispute. Both governments have proposed a boundary based on the principle of equidistance, but with different basepoint selections, resulting in small differences in the line. Resolution of the issue should be simple, but has been hindered because it might influence other unresolved maritime boundary issues between Canada and the United States.[tpl]cite book |last= Charney |first= Jonathan I. |coauthors= David A.

A map of the Juan de Fuca Canyon is available at Map of Known Deep Corals in and around the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary, NOAA Ocean Explorer The proposed equidistant boundary currently marks the northern boundary of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. British Columbia's position is based on the principle of natural prolongation which developed in international law. It poses a dilemma for the federal government of Canada. If Canada holds that the principle of natural prolongation applies to the Juan de Fuca Canyon on its Pacific Ocean coast, the assertion could undermine Canada's argument in the Gulf of Maine boundary dispute. In this Atlantic Ocean context, Canada favors an outcome based on the principle of equidistance.[tpl]cite book |last= McRae |first= Donald Malcolm |coauthors= Gordon Ross Munro |title= Canadian Oceans Policy: National Strategies and the New Law of the Sea |year= 1989 |publisher= UBC Press |isbn= 978-0-7748-0346-5 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=IFVH8zKQAzkC&pg=PA151 |pages= 151–152[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last= Johnston |first= Douglas M. |coauthors= Mark J.

==Salish Sea==

In March 2008, the Chemainus First Nation proposed renaming the strait the "Salish Sea", an idea that reportedly met with approval by British Columbia's Aboriginal Relations Minister Mike de Jong, who pledged to put it before the B.C. cabinet for discussion. Making Salish Sea official required a formal application to the Geographical Names Board of Canada.[tpl]cite news |title=Strait of Georgia could be renamed Salish Sea |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/03/09/bc-salish-sea-renamed.html |work=Canadian Press |publisher=CBC.ca |date=2008-03-09 |accessdate=2008-03-10 [/tpl] A parallel American movement promoting the name had a different definition, combining of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound as well as the Strait of Georgia and related waters under the more general name Salish Sea. This latter definition was made official in 2009 by geographic boards of Canada and the United States.
In October 2009, the Washington State Board of Geographic Names approved the Salish Sea toponym, not to replace the names of the Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and Strait of Juan de Fuca, but instead as a collective term for all three.[tpl]cite web | date =2009-10-30 | url =http://www.dnr.wa.gov/ResearchScience/News/Pages/nr09_177.aspx | title =STATE BOARD ON GEOGRAPHIC NAMES APPROVES ‘SALISH SEA’ [/tpl] The British Columbia Geographical Names Office passed a resolution only recommending that the name be adopted by the Geographical Names Board of Canada, should its US counterpart approve the name-change.Washington state adopts “Salish Sea” name for body of water including Strait of Georgia, Carlito Pablo, Georgia Straight, October 30, 2009[tpl]cite web|last=Berger|first=Knute|authorlink=Knute Berger|title=Smooth Sailing for the Salish Sea?|date=October 20, 2009|publisher=Crosscut|url=http://crosscut.com/blog/crosscut/19058/|accessdate=August 13, 2011[/tpl] The United States Board on Geographic Names approved the name on November 12, 2009.[tpl]cite web|last=Berger|first=Knute|authorlink=Knute Berger|title=U.S. approves Salish Sea name|date=November 12, 2009|publisher=Crosscut|url=http://crosscut.com/blog/crosscut/19183/|accessdate=August 13, 2011[/tpl]
