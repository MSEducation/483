==History==

Following European settlement of the Colony of New South Wales in 1788, a penal colony was established, at what is now Sydney. Establishment of the colony was motivated by the conclusion of the American War of Independence, which forced Britain to find ways of dealing with criminals other than transporting them to the United States. The initial settlement at Sydney Cove in Port Jackson involved housing convicts in tents, guarded by marines. A further surge of convicts arrived in Sydney following the end of the Napoleonic wars. Convicts worked for pay and, where good behaviour was demonstrated, could be assigned to masters. Chain gangs were established in 1826 up until transportation ended in 1840.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.correctiveservices.nsw.gov.au/about-us/history-of-nsw-corrections |title=History of NSW Corrections |publisher=Corrective Services NSW |year=2008 |accessdate=19 November 2011 [/tpl]
Gaols were established in Berrima (1836), Cockatoo Island (1839), Darlinghurst (1841), Parramatta (1842), Maitland (1848), and (site of the current Four Seasons hotel located) in The Rocks and later in Goulburn (1884) and Bathurst (1888), Long Bay (1909) as the State Reformatory for Women, and Emu Plains (1914).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2005/20050711_supermax/prison-chronology.htm |title=Chronology - A History of Australian Prison Reform |work=Four Corners |location=Australia |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=7 November 2005 |accessdate=19 November 2011 [/tpl] In more recent years, correctional centres (as they are now known) has been established at Parklea (1983), Cessnock, Junee (1993), Lithgow, Silverwater (1997), Brewarrina (2000), John Morony Correctional Centre and Dillwynia Women's Correctional Centre in north-west Sydney, Kempsey (2004), Wellington (2007), and Nowra (2010).
