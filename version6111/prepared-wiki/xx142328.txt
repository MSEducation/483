Born in New York, she was the daughter of Ruth Livingston and Ogden Mills (son of Darius Ogden Mills) and the sister of her twin, Beatrice, Countess Granard, and of Ogden Livingston Mills who served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury. In 1907 Gladys Mills married Henry Carnegie Phipps (1879-1953), son of the wealthy Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania businessman, Henry Phipps.
