==Signs and symptoms==

A certain degree of curvature of the penis is considered normal, as many men are born with this benign condition, commonly referred to as congenital curvature. 
The disease may cause pain, hardened, big, cord-like lesions (scar tissue known as "plaques"), or abnormal curvature of the penis when erect due to chronic inflammation of the tunica albuginea (CITA). Although the popular conception of Peyronie's Disease is that it always involves curvature of the penis, the scar tissue sometimes causes divots or indentations rather than curvature. The condition may also make sexual intercourse painful and/or difficult, though many men report satisfactory intercourse in spite of the disorder.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] Although it can affect men of any race and age, it is most commonly seen in Caucasian males above the age of 40[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl], especially those of blood type A+, but has been seen in men as young as 18.
The disorder is confined to the penis, although a substantial number of men with Peyronie's exhibit concurrent connective tissue disorders in the hand, and to a lesser degree, in the feet. About 30 percent of men with Peyronie's Disease develop fibrosis in other elastic tissues of the body, such as on the hand or foot, including Dupuytren's contracture of the hand. An increased incidence in genetically related males suggests a genetic component.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=9636000

==Diagnosis==

A urologist can diagnose the disease and suggest treatment, although it is easily diagnosed by general practitioners or family doctors.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]  An ultrasound can provide conclusive evidence of Peyronie's disease, ruling out congenital curvature or other disorders.Amin, Z., Patel, U., Friedman, E. P., Vale, J. A., Kirby, R., & Lees, W. R. (1993). Colour Doppler and duplex ultrasound assessment of Peyronie's disease in impotent men. British journal of radiology, 66(785), 398–402.

==Causes==

The underlying cause of Peyronie's Disease is not well understood, but is thought to be caused by trauma or injury to the penis usually through sexual activity although many patients often are unaware of any traumatic event or injury.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/peyronies-disease/DS00427/DSECTION=causes |title=Peyronie's disease: Causes |publisher=MayoClinic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18[/tpl]
Some beta blocker drugs list Peyronie's disease as a possible side effect.

==Treatment==

Without treatment, about 12–13% of patients will spontaneously improve over time, 40–50% will get worse and the rest will be relatively stable. This is based on a survey of 97 men and therefore based on the subjective impression of the patients. No objective long term natural history via continual evaluation of patients has been recorded to date.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gelbard MK, Dorey F, James K |title=The natural history of Peyronie's disease |journal=J Urol. |volume=128 |pages=1376-1379 |year=1990 |pmid=2231932[/tpl]

===Medication and supplements===

Many oral treatments have been studied, but results so far have been mixed.[tpl]cite journal |author=Levine LA |title=Review of current nonsurgical management of Peyronie's disease |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=15 |issue=Suppl 5 |pages=S113–20 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14551587 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3901084[/tpl] Some consider the use of non-surgical approaches to be "controversial".[tpl]cite journal |author=Hauck EW, Diemer T, Schmelz HU, Weidner W |title=A critical analysis of nonsurgical treatment of Peyronie's disease |journal=European Urology |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=987–97 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16698449 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2006.02.059[/tpl]
Collagenase clostridium histolyticum (marketed as Xiaflex by Auxilium), a drug originally approved by the FDA to treat Dupuytren's contracture, is now an FDA approved injectable drug for treatment of Peyronie's disease. The drug is reported to work by breaking down the excess collagen in the penis that causes Peyronie's disease.[tpl]cite web|title=FDA approves first drug treatment for Peyronie’s disease|url=http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm377849.htm|work=FDA NEWS RELEASE|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=6 December 2013|date=6 December 2013|year=2013[/tpl]Pollack, Andrew.

Vitamin E supplementation has been studied for decades, and some success has been reported in older trials, but those successes have not been reliably repeated in larger, newer studies.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mynderse LA, Monga M |title=Oral therapy for Peyronie's disease |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=340–4 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12454684 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3900869[/tpl] A combination of Vitamin E and colchicine has shown some promise in delaying progression of the condition.[tpl]cite journal |author=Prieto Castro RM, Leva Vallejo ME, Regueiro Lopez JC, Anglada Curado FJ, Alvarez Kindelan J, Requena Tapia MJ |title=Combined treatment with vitamin E and colchicine in the early stages of Peyronie's disease |journal=BJU International |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=522–4 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12656907 |doi=10.1046/j.1464-410X.2003.04134.x[/tpl]
Some newer agents targeting the basic mechanisms of inflammation have been studied in larger clinical trials. These include potassium para-aminobenzoate (Potaba),[tpl]cite journal |author=Weidner W, et al. |title=Potassium Paraaminobenzoate (POTABA) in the Treatment of Peyronie's Disease: A Prospective, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Study |journal=European Urology |volume=47 |pages=530–6 |year=2005 |pmid=15774254 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2004.12.022 |last2=Hauck |first2=EW |last3=Schnitker |first3=J |author4=Peyronie's Disease Study Group of Andrological Group of German Urologists |issue=4[/tpl] pentoxifylline (acting through TGFβ1 inhibition),[tpl]cite journal |author=Safarinejad MR, et al. |title=A double-blind placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of pentoxifylline in early chronic Peyronie's disease |journal=British Journal of Urology International |volume=106 |pages=240–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19863517 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.09041.x |last2=Asgari |first2=MA |last3=Hosseini |first3=SY |last4=Dadkhah |first4=F |issue=2[/tpl] and Coenzyme Q10.[tpl]cite journal |author=Safarinejad MR |title=Safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 supplementation in early chronic Peyronie's disease: a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=22 |pages=298–309 |year=2010 |pmid=20720560 |doi=10.1038/ijir.2010.20 |issue=5[/tpl]
The efficacy of Interferon-alpha-2b in the early stages of the disease has been reported in recent publications but it was found to be less effective in cases where calcification of the plaque had occurred in common with many treatments.[tpl]cite journal |author=Trost LW, Gur S, Hellstrom WJ |title=Pharmacological Management of Peyronie's Disease |journal=Drugs |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=527–45 |year=2007 |pmid=17352513 |doi=10.2165/00003495-200767040-00004[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1097/01.SMJ.0000056658.60032.D3 | author = Dang G, Matern R, Bivalacqua TJ, Sikka S, Hellstrom WJ | title = Intralesional interferon-alpha-2B injections for the treatment of Peyronie's disease | journal = South.

Formulations of superoxide dismutase are also reported to be effective in Peyronie's disease.[tpl]cite journal |author=Riedl CR, Sternig P, Gallé G, et al. |title=Liposomal recombinant human superoxide dismutase for the treatment of Peyronie's disease: a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind prospective clinical study |journal=European Urology |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=656–61 |date=October 2005 |pmid=15982798 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2005.04.011[/tpl]
Injections to plaques (scar tissue formed by the inflammation) with Verapamil may be effective in some patients, but a recent placebo controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement. Use of iontophoresis with Verapamil and Dexamethasone, applied to the affected areas, has been studied.[tpl]cite journal |author=Riedl CR, Plas E, Engelhardt P, Daha K, Pflüger H |title=Iontophoresis for treatment of Peyronie's disease |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=95–9 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10604323 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(05)67981-5[/tpl]

===Surgery===

Surgery, such as the "Nesbit operation", (which is named after Reed M. Nesbit (1898–1979), an American Urologist at University of Michigan)[tpl]cite journal |author=Ralph DJ, Minhas S |title=The management of Peyronie's disease |journal=BJU International |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=208–15 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14690485 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2004.04587.x[/tpl] is considered a last resort and should only be performed by highly skilled urological surgeons knowledgeable in specialized corrective surgical techniques. A penile prosthesis may be appropriate in advanced cases.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hellstrom WJ, Usta MF |title=Surgical approaches for advanced Peyronie's disease patients |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=15 |issue=Suppl 5 |pages=S121–4 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14551588 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3901085[/tpl]
A European surgery called the Leriche technique, in which an 18 gauge needle is used to lacerate the plaque, has shown effectiveness at reducing curvature and returning sexual function.[tpl]cite journal |author=Khouaja K, Delmas V, Boccon-Gibod L |title=technique for the treatment of La Peyronie's disease |language=French |journal=Progrès En Urologie |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=586–9; discussion 588–9 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15776920[/tpl]

===Physical therapy and devices===

Self-administered manual stretching techniques, as well as a number of traction devices which exert gentle longitudinal forces on the plaque, are currently being studied in clinical trials. However, these penis extenders are controversial and most doctors recommend staying away from them due to their unknown and potentially harmful side-effects.
Doctors are starting to look into less intrusive forms of therapy as an alternative to surgery because many patients were unhappy with the results of the intervention due mostly to the penile shortening that happens after the surgery.Use of Penile Extender Device in the Treatment of Penile Curvature as a Result of Peyronie's Disease. Results of a Phase II Prospective Study http://www.andromedical.com/pdf/en/study_penile_extender_device_treatment_penile_curvature.pdf Although there is no cure for Peyronie's Disease or fibrotic disorders that are localized in different areas of the body, several clinical studies such as the one mentioned above point to penis extenders as a possible treatment to correct curvature, or at the very least to impede the curvature from getting worse. According to Doctor Gontero, the leading researcher of the above mentioned study which was published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2009, "Overall treatment results were subjectively scored as acceptable in spite of curvature improvements, which varied from 'no change' to 'mild improvement.'" The study concluded that penile extender devices provided only minimal improvements in penile curvature but patients were generally satisfied likely from increased penile length. Several other studies exist which exhibit minor to moderate improvements in curvature, length and thickness but no cases of complete reversal of the Peyronie's curvature.Can an External Penis Stretcher Reduce Peyronie's Penile Curvature?

===Counseling===

Peyronie's Disease can be a physically and psychologically devastating disease. While most men will continue to be able to have sexual relations, they are likely to experience some degree of deformity and erectile dysfunction in the wake of the disease process. It is not uncommon for men afflicted with Peyronie's Disease to exhibit depression or withdrawal from their sexual partners.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nelson CJ, Mulhall JP |title=Psychological impact of Peyronie's disease: a review |journal=J.
