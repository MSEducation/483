The Big Sioux River is a tributary of the Missouri River, [tpl]convert|419|mi[/tpl] long,U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data.

The Big Sioux River rises in Roberts County, South Dakota on a low plateau known as the Coteau des Prairies and flows generally southwardly through Grant, Codington, Hamlin, Brookings, Moody, and Minnehaha counties, past the communities of Watertown, Castlewood, Bruce, Flandreau, Egan, Trent, Dell Rapids, and Baltic to Sioux Falls, where it passes over a waterfall which gives that city its name.  Downstream of Sioux Falls and the community of Brandon, the Big Sioux is used to define the boundary between South Dakota and Iowa, flowing along the eastern borders of Lincoln and Union counties in South Dakota, and the western borders of Lyon, Sioux and Plymouth counties in Iowa, past the communities of Canton, Fairview, Hudson, North Sioux City, and Dakota Dunes in South Dakota and Beloit, Hawarden and Akron in Iowa.  It joins the Missouri River from the north at Sioux City, Iowa.DeLorme (1998).  Iowa Atlas & Gazetteer.  Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme.  ISBN 0-89933-214-5DeLorme (2001).  South Dakota Atlas & Gazetteer.

==Tributaries==

==Flood control==

Between 1955 and 1961, an extensive flood control system was constructed along the Big Sioux and some of its tributaries in Sioux Falls to protect the city from a 100-year flood event.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.siouxfalls.org/PublicWorks/water_conservation/flood_control | title = Flood Control | publisher = City of Sioux Falls | accessdate = 2010-04-19[/tpl] Features of the system include [tpl]convert|29|mi|km[/tpl] of levees, a floodwall in downtown, and a [tpl]convert|15000|ft|m[/tpl] diversion channel with a dam at one end and a [tpl]convert|118|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] spillway at the other. The diversion channel connects two ends of the Big Sioux's natural loop around central Sioux Falls in an effort to channel floodwater away from the city. The levees then act to contain any floodwater either remaining in the natural channel or originating from Skunk Creek (whose mouth is downriver of the diversion dam).Jorgensen, Don. Sioux Falls diverts water to ease flooding http://www.keloland.com/NewsDetail6162.cfm?Id=97858 KELO-TV. March 15, 2010. (accessed April 19, 2010). Additionally, a greenway covers much of the river's floodplain in southern and eastern Sioux Falls, further mitigating any property damage from high water.
