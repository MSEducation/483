Bill "Herman" Hamilton is an Australian former rugby league footballer of the 1960s and 70s. Known as Herman by teammates after his resemblance to Herman Munster, he played in the front row for the Manly-Warringah and North Sydney clubs in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership, winning the 1972 and 1973 premierships with the Sea Eagles. He also gained selection for the Australia on the 1973 Kangaroo Tour though he only played in eight minor matches and didn't play a test.
Surprisingly unwanted by Manly at the end of 1974, he went on to captain the North Sydney Bears, bringing much needed discipline to a club regarded as ‘easybeats’. Hamilton captain-coached the club to their last major trophy the Channel 10 Challenge Cup in 1978.
In 2010 he was named at prop forward in Kurri Rugby League Club's team of the century.[tpl]cite news|last=cessnockadvertiser.com.au|title=Kurri Rugby League Club announces Team of the Century|url=http://www.cessnockadvertiser.com.au/news/local/sport/rugby-league/kurri-rugby-league-club-announces-team-of-the-century/1891170.aspx|accessdate=2 April 2011|newspaper=The Advertiser|date=21 July 2010[/tpl]
