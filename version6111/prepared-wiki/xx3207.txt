The Eureka Rebellion of year 1854 was a historically significant organised rebellion of gold miners of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia, who revolted against the colonial authority of the United Kingdom. The Battle of the Eureka Stockade (by which the rebellion is popularly known) was fought between miners and the Colonial forces of Australia on 3 December 1854 at Eureka Lead and named for the stockade structure erected by miners during the conflict.[tpl]cite book | author=Wendy Lewis, Simon Balderstone and John Bowan | title=Events That Shaped Australia | publisher=New Holand | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 [/tpl] Resulting in the deaths of at least 27 people, the majority of whom were rebels, it was the most significant conflict in the colonial history of Victoria.

As such, the Eureka Rebellion is controversially identified with the birth of democracy in Australia and interpreted by some as a political revolt.[ref]'Dr. H.V. Evatt, leader of the ALP, wrote that "The Eureka Stockade was of crucial importance in the making of Australian democracy"; Robert Menzies, later Liberal Prime Minister, said that "the Eureka revolution was an earnest attempt at democratic government"; and, Ben Chifley, former ALP Prime Minister, wrote that "Eureka was more than an incident or passing phase.
