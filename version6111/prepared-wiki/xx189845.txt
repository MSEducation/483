The Rufus Porter Museum is located in Bridgton, Maine. It is dedicated to the life and works of Rufus Porter (1792â€“1884). The museum currently has two locations, one on North High Street, in two older houses; the other is located in the Wales and Hamblen Building.

==Westwood Murals==

Originally located in the Dr. Francis Howe home, in  Westwood, Massachusetts, these murals were removed in 1965. The museum currently displays them in the Wales and Hamblen building. They are considered the finest example of Porter's work. The murals are on loan, and the museum hopes to eventually purchase them.
