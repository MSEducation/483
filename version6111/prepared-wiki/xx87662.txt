===History===

St Albans station opened on 1 February 1887. During the steam era trains operated hourly from Flinders Street to Braybrook Junction, with only eight trains continuing to St Albans. The station was made the terminus of the electrified suburban network from the city in October 1921, with trains running every 40 minutes by day and hourly at night.[tpl]cite book|author=SE Dornan & RG Henderson|title=Electric Railways of Victoria|publisher=Australian Electric Traction Society|page=68|year=1979|isbn=0-909459-06-1[/tpl]
The original station was located at the northern end of the Main Road level crossing, with all terminating electric trains using Platform 2.
In 1959 the station was rebuilt, with an island platform build on the southern side of the level crossing. One side faced the main line, with the other side formed a dock platform for terminating suburban trains. The old westbound platform was removed but the eastbound platform remained for Spencer Street bound regional trains.
