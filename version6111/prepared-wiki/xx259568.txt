In 2009, the performances were awarded Ireland's Meteor Music Award as the best international performance of the year.
In September, October and November 2008, Cohen gave a marathon tour of Europe, including stops in Austria, Ireland, Poland, Romania, Italy, Germany, and Scandinavia. In London, he played two more shows at the O2 Arena and two additional shows at the Royal Albert Hall.

===2009 tour===

The third leg of Cohen's World Tour 2008-2009 encompassed New Zealand and Australia from 20 January to 10 February 2009.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.leonardcohenforum.com/viewforum.php?f=31 |title=• View forum - The Pacific Tour 2009 |publisher=leonardcohenforum.com |year=2009 |accessdate=2011-02-21[/tpl] In January 2009, The Pacific Tour first came to New Zealand. Simon Sweetman in The Dominion Post (Wellington) of 21 January wrote "It is hard work having to put this concert in to words so I'll just say something I have never said in a review before and will never say again: this was the best show I have ever seen." The Sydney Entertainment Centre show on 28 January sold out rapidly, which motivated promoters to announce a second show at the venue. The first performance was well-received, and the audience of 12,000 responded with five standing ovations. In response to hearing about the devastation to the Yarra Valley region of Victoria in Australia, Cohen donated $200,000 to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal in support of those affected by the extensive Black Saturday bushfires that razed the area just weeks after his performance at the Rochford Winery in the A Day on the Green concert.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/feb/10/leonard-cohen-australian-bushfire-donation |title=Leonard Cohen donates £90,000 to Australian bushfire victims |publisher=The Guardian |location=London |first=Rosie |last=Swash |date=10 February 2009 |accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl] Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper reported: "Tour promoter Frontier Touring said $200,000 would be donated on behalf of Cohen, fellow performer Paul Kelly and Frontier to aid victims of the bushfires."[tpl]cite news |title=Leonard Cohen donates concert profits to bushfire relief fund |publisher=Herald Sun |date=11 February 2009 |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25037004-5012974,00.html[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
On 19 February 2009, Cohen played his first American concert in fifteen years at the Beacon Theatre in New York City.[tpl]cite web |title=Leonard Cohen Dazzles At New York Tour Warm-Up |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269375/leonard-cohen-dazzles-at-new-york-tour-warm-up  |accessdate=20 February 2009[/tpl] The show, showcased as the special performance for fans, Leonard Cohen Forum members and press, was the only show in the whole three-year tour which was broadcast on the radio (NPR) and available as the free podcast.
The North American Tour of 2009 opened on 1 April and included the performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on Friday, 17 April 2009, in front of one of the largest outdoor theatre crowds in the history of the festival. His performance of Hallelujah was widely regarded as one of the highlights of the festival, thus repeating the major success of the 2008 Glastonbury appearance. The performance has been included on 2010 Songs from the Road live release. During this leg, Cohen regularly performed new song, "Lullaby".
On 1 July 2009, Cohen started his marathon European tour, his third in two years. The itinerary mostly included sport arenas and open air Summer festivals in Germany, UK, France, Spain, Ireland (the show at O2 in Dublin won him the second Meteor Music Award in a row), but also performances in Serbia in the Belgrade Arena, in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Turkey, and again in Romania. On 3 August, Cohen gave an open air show at the Piazza San Marco in Venice.
On 18 September 2009, on the stage at a concert in Valencia, Spain, Cohen suddenly fainted halfway through performing his song "Bird on the Wire", the fourth in the two-act set list; Cohen was brought down backstage by his band members and then admitted to local hospital, while the concert was suspended.[tpl]cite news |title=Leonard Cohen OK after fainting on stage |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/09/19/cohen-collapse.html |date=19 September 2009 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] It was reported that Cohen had stomach problems, and possibly food poisoning.[tpl]cite news |title=Leonard Cohen collapses on stage |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8264447.stm |date=19 September 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=19 September 2009[/tpl] Three days later, on 21 September, on his 75th birthday, he performed in Barcelona. The show, last in Europe in 2009 and rumoured to be the last European concert ever, attracted many international fans, who lighted the green candles honouring Cohen's birthday, leading Cohen to give a special speech of thanks for the fans and Leonard Cohen Forum.
The last concert of this leg was held in Ramat Gan, Israel, on 24 September, three days after Cohen's 75th birthday, at Ramat Gan Stadium. The event was surrounded by public discussion due to a cultural boycott of Israel proposed by a number of musicians.[tpl]cite news |last=Kliger |first=Rachelle |title=Leonard Cohen's Ramallah gig called off |work=mideast.jpost.com |publisher=Jerusalem Post |date=2009-07-13 |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1246443798463&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |accessdate=2012-02-20[/tpl] Nevertheless, tickets for the Tel Aviv concert, Cohen's first performance in Israel since 1980, sold out in less than 24 hours. It was announced that the proceeds from the sale of the 47,000 tickets would go into a charitable fund in partnership with Amnesty International and would be used by Israeli and Palestinian peace groups for projects providing health services to children and bringing together Israeli veterans and former Palestinian fighters and the families of those killed in the conflict. However, on 17 August 2009, Amnesty International released a statement saying they were withdrawing from any involvement with the concert and its proceeds.[tpl]cite web |title=Amnesty International and the Leonard Cohen Fund for Reconciliation, Tolerance and Peace |work=Public document |format=PDF |publisher=Amnesty International |date=17 Aug 2009 |url= http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/025/2009/en/4f6becdc-e532-4f64-a755-c598a6c16e91/mde150252009en.pdf |accessdate=2012-02-20[/tpl] Amnesty International later stated that its withdrawal was not due to the boycott but "the lack of support from Israeli and Palestinian NGOs."A concert for tolerance and peace? For shame! by Chris Selley, National Post, 8 September 2009. The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) led the call for the boycott, claiming that Cohen was "intent on whitewashing Israel's colonial apartheid regime by performing in Israel."Leonard Cohen's Ramallah gig called off by Rachelle Kliger, Jerusalem Post, 13 July 2009. On 24 September at the Ramat Gan concert, Cohen was highly emotional about the Israeli-Palestinian NGO Bereaved Families for Peace. He mentioned the organization twice, saying "It was a while ago that I first heard of the work of the 'Bereaved Parents for Peace'. That there was this coalition of Palestinian and Israeli families who had lost so much in the conflict and whose depth of suffering had compelled them to reach across the border into the houses of the enemy. Into the houses of those, to locate them who had suffered as much as they had, and then to stand with them in aching confraternity, a witness to an understanding that is beyond peace and that is beyond confrontation. So, this is not about forgiving and forgetting, this is not about laying down one's arms in a time of war, this is not even about peace, although, God willing, it could be a beginning. This is about a response to human grief. A radical, unique and holy, holy, holy response to human suffering. Baruch Hashem, thank God, I bow my head in respect to the nobility of this enterprise."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLGWXsAp7GA |title=Cohen laudes the Bereaved Families for Peace |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=13 November 2010[/tpl] At the end of the show he blessed the crowd by the Priestly Blessing, a Jewish blessing offered by Kohanim. Cohen's surname derives from this Hebrew word for priest, thus identifying him as a Kohen.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9WrFRI0xY |title=Cohen blesses crowd with the Priestly Blessing |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=13 November 2010[/tpl]
The sixth leg of the 2008-2009 world tour went again to US, with fifteen shows in October and November, with the "final" show in San Jose. The final leg included two new songs, "Feels So Good" and "The Darkness". But at that point, Cohen's "World Tour 2010" was already announced with the European dates in March.
The 2009 world tour earned a reported $9.5 million, putting Cohen at number 39 on Billboard magazine's list of the year's top musical "money makers."[tpl]cite web |title=Music's Top 40 Money Makers |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959249/money-makers-page-1 |date=26 February 2010 |publisher=Billboard |accessdate=1 March 2010[/tpl]

===2010 tour===

Cohen's 2008-2009 world tour was prolonged into 2010. Originally scheduled to start in March, the first dozen of the original European dates were postponed to September and October due to Cohen's lower-back injury.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/leonard-cohen/49613 |title=Leonard Cohen postpones European tour after injury |publisher=Nme.com |date=6 February 2010 |accessdate=13 November 2010[/tpl] Officially billed as the "World Tour 2010", the tour started on 25 July 2010 in Arena Zagreb, Croatia, where in the week of the show 16 of Cohen's albums simultaneously entered the Croatian Top 40,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leonardcohenforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=22807 |title=Leonard's 16 albums in Croatian Top 40 |publisher=Leonardcohenforum.com |date= |accessdate=13 November 2010[/tpl] while Cohen's work was presented by the translation of Book of Mercy, two of Cohen's biographies, and with selection of poems in major literary magazine Quorum, while there was also the translation of Linda Hutcheon's work on Cohen's literary output. In December 2010, the national daily newspaper Vjesnik ranked Cohen's show among the five most important cultural event in Croatia in 2010, in the poll among dozen of intellectuals and writers; it was the only event ranked which was not actually Croatian.Najveci kultruni dogadjaji u Hrvatskoj 2010. godine http://www.vjesnik.hr/pdf/2010/12/28/18A18.PDF (in Croatian) The tour continued through August, with stops in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Scandinavia, and Ireland, where on 31 July & 1 August 2010 Cohen performed at Lissadell House in County Sligo. It was Cohen’s ninth Irish concert in just two years after a hiatus of more than 20 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lissadellhouse.com/cohen.html |title=Leonard Cohen at Lissadell House |publisher=Lissadellhouse.com |date= |accessdate=13 November 2010[/tpl] On 12 August, Cohen played the 200th show of the tour in Scandinavium, Gothenburg, Sweden, where he had already played in October 2008; the show was four hours long.
The Fall leg of the European tour started in early September with an open-air show in Florence, Italy, and continued through Germany, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and Austria, where Cohen performed at the famous open-air opera stage of Römersteinbruch bei St. Margarethen im Burgenland, and then continued with dates in France, Poland, Russia (Moscow's State Kremlin Palace), Slovenia and Slovakia.[tpl]cite web|author=by jarkko » 2 November 2009, 7:56 pm |url=http://www.leonardcohenforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=44&t=19806 |title=Leonard Cohen Tour Dates 2010 |publisher=Leonardcohenforum.com |date=2 November 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2010[/tpl] In Slovenia's brand new Arena Stožice, Cohen accepted Croatia's Porin music award for best foreign live video programme, which he won for his Live in London DVD.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leonardcohenforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=253034#p253034 |title=• View topic - Leonard Cohen receives the PORIN Award (Croatia) |publisher=Leonardcohenforum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21[/tpl] Cohen's last European show was held in Sibamac Arena, in Bratislava, Slovakia. The shows in late September and October were performed without Sharon Robinson, who left this tour leg due to heavy illness; the setlist omitted songs co-written by her, but old Cohen standards were added instead.
The third leg of the 2010 tour started on 28 October in New Zealand and continued in Australia, including an open-air concert at Hanging Rock near Melbourne. It was the first show ever organised at the site. The tour finished with seven special dates added in Vancouver, Portland, Victoria and Oakland, with two final shows in Las Vegas' The Colosseum at Caesars Palace on 10 and 11 December. The very last concert on 11 December was the 246th show on the world tour which started on 11 May 2008.

==Live releases==
