Thunder After Lightning (The Uncut Demos) is the second intermediate album release from Christian rock band Downhere. This album is composed of fourteen "demos" which were considered for the potential inclusion on their previous release Wide-Eyed and Mystified. The CD also contains three song demos that were studio recorded and released on Wide-Eyed and Mystified; "1000 Miles Apart", "A Better Way", and "Jesus, Ellipsis". The latter developed into the song now entitled "The Real Jesus".
