The woman claimed she could not hear after the explosion, and said: "All the windows on the non-corridor side blew in. My suitcase came down from the rack, and my purse shot off on to the glass". O'Shea had thrown nitroglycerine from the train as it was going through a bridge. Special Branch found four tins of grey "pistol powder", primers and a 12-bore cartridge in O'Shea's locker at the school. They also found 45 tear gas cartridges at his home in Bishopsthorpe Road, Sydenham.
