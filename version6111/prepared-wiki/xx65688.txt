==Animals==

Many animals use the variation in duration of melatonin production each day as a seasonal clock.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lincoln GA, Andersson H, Loudon A | title = Clock genes in calendar cells as the basis of annual timekeeping in mammals – a unifying hypothesis | journal = J. Endocrinol. | volume = 179 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 |date=October 2003 | pmid = 14529560 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1790001 [/tpl] In animals including humans[tpl]cite journal | author = Arendt J, Skene DJ | title = Melatonin as a chronobiotic | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–39 |date=February 2005 | pmid = 15649736 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2004.05.002 | quote = Exogenous melatonin has acute sleepiness-inducing and temperature-lowering effects during 'biological daytime', and when suitably timed (it is most effective around dusk and dawn) it will shift the phase of the human circadian clock (sleep, endogenous melatonin, core body temperature, cortisol) to earlier (advance phase shift) or later (delay phase shift) times. [/tpl] the profile of melatonin synthesis and secretion is affected by the variable duration of night in summer as compared to winter. The change in duration of secretion thus serves as a biological signal for the organization of daylength-dependent (photoperiodic) seasonal functions such as reproduction, behavior, coat growth and camouflage coloring in seasonal animals. In seasonal breeders that do not have long gestation periods and that mate during longer daylight hours, the melatonin signal controls the seasonal variation in their sexual physiology, and similar physiological effects can be induced by exogenous melatonin in animals including mynah birds[tpl]cite journal | pages = 803–9 | doi = 10.1071/ZO9840803 | url = http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/ZO9840803.htm | title = Effect of Melatonin on the Adrenl and Gonad of the Common Mynah Acridtheres tristis | year = 1984 | author = Chaturvedi CM | journal = Australian Journal of Zoology | volume = 32 | issue = 6[/tpl] and hamsters.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chen HJ | title = Spontaneous and melatonin-induced testicular regression in male golden hamsters: augmented sensitivity of the old male to melatonin inhibition | journal = Neuroendocrinology | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–6 |date=July 1981 | pmid = 7254478 | doi = 10.1159/000123198 [/tpl]
In mammals, melatonin is biosynthesized in four enzymatic steps from the essential dietary amino acid tryptophan, with serotonin produced at the third step. Melatonin is secreted into the blood by the pineal gland in the brain.  Known as the "hormone of darkness," it is secreted in darkness in both day-active (diurnal) and night-active (nocturnal) animals. It may also be produced by a variety of peripheral cells such as bone marrow cells,[tpl]cite journal | author = Maestroni GJ | title = The immunotherapeutic potential of melatonin | journal = Expert Opin Investig Drugs | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 467–76 |date=March 2001 | pmid = 11227046 | doi = 10.1517/13543784.10.3.467 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Conti A, Conconi S, Hertens E, Skwarlo-Sonta K, Markowska M, Maestroni JM | title = Evidence for melatonin synthesis in mouse and human bone marrow cells | journal = J.

Usually, the melatonin concentration in these cells is much higher than that found in the blood, but it does not seem to be regulated by the photoperiod.

==Mammals==

Melatonin, produced in the pineal gland which is outside of the blood–brain barrier, acts as an endocrine hormone since it is released into the blood.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kaur C, Ling EA | title = Antioxidants and neuroprotection in the adult and developing central nervous system | journal = Curr. Med. Chem. | volume = 15 | issue = 29 | pages = 3068–80 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19075654 | doi = 10.2174/092986708786848640 [/tpl]
Melatonin can suppress libido by inhibiting secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland, especially in mammals that have a breeding season when daylight hours are long. The reproduction of long-day breeders is repressed by melatonin and the reproduction of short-day breeders is stimulated by melatonin.  During the night, melatonin regulates leptin, lowering its levels.
Light/dark information reaches the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) from retinal photosensitive ganglion cells, which are intrinsically photosensitive photoreceptor cells that are distinct from those involved in the primary (at least, from one point of view) image formation function of the eye (that is the rods and cones of the retina). These cells represent approximately 2% of all retinal ganglion cells in humans and express the photopigment melanopsin.[tpl]cite journal | author = Nayak SK, Jegla T, Panda S | title = Role of a novel photopigment, melanopsin, in behavioral adaptation to light | journal = Cell. Mol. Life Sci. | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 144–54 |date=January 2007 | pmid = 17160354 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-006-5581-1 [/tpl]
Melanopsin, often confused with melatonin because of its similar name, is structurally unrelated to the hormone. It is a conventional 7-transmembrane opsin protein with the usual vitamin A-like cis-retinal cofactor having a peak absorption at 484 nm, in the blue light part of the visible spectrum.[tpl]cite journal | author = Roberts JE | title = Update on the positive effects of light in humans | journal = Photochem. Photobiol. | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | pages = 490–2 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15656701 | doi = 10.1562/2004-12-02-IR-391 [/tpl] The photoperiod cue created by blue light (from a blue image of the sky) entrains a circadian rhythm, and thus governs resultant production of specific "dark"- and "light"-induced neural and endocrine signals that regulate behavioral and physiological circadian rhythms associated with melatonin. Melatonin is secreted in darkness in both day-active (diurnal) and night-active (nocturnal) animals.[tpl]cite journal | author = Challet E | title = Minireview: Entrainment of the suprachiasmatic clockwork in diurnal and nocturnal mammals | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 148 | issue = 12 | pages = 5648–55 |date=December 2007 | pmid = 17901231 | doi = 10.1210/en.2007-0804 [/tpl]

==Humans==

===Circadian rhythm===

In humans, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland, a small endocrine gland[tpl]cite journal | author = Reiter RJ | title = Pineal melatonin: cell biology of its synthesis and of its physiological interactions | journal = Endocr. Rev. | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–80 |date=May 1991 | pmid = 1649044 | doi =10.1210/edrv-12-2-151 [/tpl] located in the center of the brain but outside the blood–brain barrier. The melatonin signal forms part of the system that regulates the sleep–wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature, but it is the central nervous system (specifically the suprachiasmatic nuclei, or SCN) that controls the daily cycle in most components of the paracrine and endocrine systems[tpl]cite journal | author = Richardson GS | title = The human circadian system in normal and disordered sleep | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 66 Suppl 9 | issue = | pages = 3–9; quiz 42–3 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16336035 | doi = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Perreau-Lenz S, Pévet P, Buijs RM, Kalsbeek A | title = The biological clock: the bodyguard of temporal homeostasis | journal = Chronobiol.

Infants' melatonin levels become regular in about the third month after birth, with the highest levels measured between midnight and 8:00 AM.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ardura J, Gutierrez R, Andres J, Agapito T | title = Emergence and evolution of the circadian rhythm of melatonin in children | journal = Horm.

In humans, 90% of melatonin is cleared in a single passage through the liver, a small amount is excreted in urine, and a small amount is found in saliva.
Human melatonin production decreases as a person ages.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sack RL, Lewy AJ, Erb DL, Vollmer WM, Singer CM | title = Human melatonin production decreases with age | journal = J. Pineal Res. | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 379–88 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3783419 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-079X.1986.tb00760.x [/tpl] Also, as children become teenagers, the nightly schedule of melatonin release is delayed, leading to later sleeping and waking times.[tpl]cite web | title = Why Aren't Teens Getting Enough Sleep? | url = http://kidshealth.org/teen/your_body/take_care/how_much_sleep.html |work=How Much Sleep Do I Need? |year=2009 | author = Gavin ML, Scaivina MT[/tpl]

====Light dependence====

Production of melatonin by the pineal gland is inhibited by light to the retina and permitted by darkness. Its onset each evening is called the dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO).
It is principally blue light, around 460 to 480 nm, that suppresses melatonin,[tpl]cite journal | author = Brainard GC, Hanifin JP, Greeson JM, Byrne B, Glickman G, Gerner E, Rollag MD | title = Action spectrum for melatonin regulation in humans: evidence for a novel circadian photoreceptor | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 21 | issue = 16 | pages = 6405–12 |date=August 2001 | pmid = 11487664 | doi = [/tpl] proportional to the light intensity and length of exposure. Until recent history, humans in temperate climates were exposed to few hours of (blue) daylight in the winter; their fires gave predominantly yellow light. The incandescent light bulb widely used in the twentieth century produced relatively little blue light.Cornell University, Light source spectra  Wearing glasses that block blue light in the hours before bedtime may decrease melatonin loss. Kayumov et al. showed that light containing only wavelengths greater than 530 nm does not suppress melatonin in bright-light conditions.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kayumov L, Casper RF, Hawa RJ, Perelman B, Chung SA, Sokalsky S, Shapiro CM | title = Blocking low-wavelength light prevents nocturnal melatonin suppression with no adverse effect on performance during simulated shift work | journal = J.

When used several hours before sleep according to the phase response curve for melatonin in humans, small amounts (0.3 mg) of melatonin shift the circadian clock earlier, thus promoting earlier sleep onset and morning awakening.[tpl]cite book | author = Terman MR, Wirz-Justice A | title = Chronotherapeutics for Affective Disorders: A Clinician's Manual for Light and Wake Therapy | publisher = S Karger Pub | location = Basel | year = 2009 | page = 71 | isbn = 3-8055-9120-9 [/tpl]

====Antioxidant====

Besides its function as synchronizer of the biological clock, melatonin is a powerful free-radical scavenger and wide-spectrum antioxidant as discovered in 1993.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tan DX, Chen LD, Poeggeler B, Manchester LC, Reiter RJ | title = Melatonin: a potent, endogenous hydroxyl radical scavenger | journal = Endocrine J. | year = 1993 | volume = 1 | pages = 57–60 | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxkdW54aWFudGFufGd4OjVkMjA5NGZkMzFmYjRkOTU[/tpl] In many less complex life forms, this is its only known function.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tan DX, Manchester LC, Terron MP, Flores LJ, Reiter RJ | title = One molecule, many derivatives: a never-ending interaction of melatonin with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species? | journal = J.

Melatonin has been proven to be twice as active as vitamin E, believed to be the most effective lipophilic antioxidant.[tpl]cite journal | author = Pieri C, Marra M, Moroni F, Recchioni R, Marcheselli F | title = Melatonin: a peroxyl radical scavenger more effective than vitamin E | journal = Life Sci. | volume = 55 | issue = 15 | pages = PL271–6 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7934611 | doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(94)00666-0 [/tpl] An important characteristic of melatonin that distinguishes it from other classic radical scavengers is that its metabolites are also scavengers in what is referred to as the cascade reaction.   Also different from other classic antioxidants, such as vitamin C and vitamin E, melatonin has amphiphilic properties. When compared to synthetic, mitochodrial-targeted antioxidants (MitoQ and MitoE), melatonin proved to be a better protector against mitochondrial oxidative stress.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lowes DA, Webster NR, Murphy MP, Galley HF | title = Antioxidants that protect mitochondria reduce interleukin-6 and oxidative stress, improve mitochondrial function, and reduce biochemical markers of organ dysfunction in a rat model of acute sepsis | journal = Br J Anaesth | volume = 110 | issue = 3 | pages = 472–80 |date=March 2013 | pmid = 23381720 | pmc = 3570068 | doi = 10.1093/bja/aes577 [/tpl]

===Immune system===

While it is known that melatonin interacts with the immune system,[tpl]cite journal | author = Carrillo-Vico A, Guerrero JM, Lardone PJ, Reiter RJ | title = A review of the multiple actions of melatonin on the immune system | journal = Endocrine | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–200 |date=July 2005 | pmid = 16217132 | doi = 10.1385/ENDO:27:2:189 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Arushanian EB, Beĭer EV | title = properties of pineal melatonin | language = Russian | journal = Eksp Klin Farmakol | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 73–80 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12596522 | doi = [/tpl] the details of those interactions are unclear. Antiinflammatory effect seems to be the most relevant and most documented in the literature.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pohanka|first=M |title=Impact of melatonin on immunity: a review|journal=Central European Journal of Medicine |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=369–376 |year=2013 |doi= 10.2478/s11536-013-0177-2|url=  http://link.springer.com/article/10.2478%2Fs11536-013-0177-2[/tpl] There have been few trials designed to judge the effectiveness of melatonin in disease treatment. Most existing data are based on small, incomplete clinical trials. Any positive immunological effect is thought to be the result of melatonin acting on high-affinity receptors (MT1 and MT2) expressed in immunocompetent cells. In preclinical studies, melatonin may enhance cytokine production,[tpl]cite journal | author = Carrillo-Vico A, Reiter RJ, Lardone PJ, Herrera JL, Fernández-Montesinos R, Guerrero JM, Pozo D | title = The modulatory role of melatonin on immune responsiveness | journal = Curr Opin Investig Drugs | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 423–31 |date=May 2006 | pmid = 16729718 | doi = [/tpl] and by doing this counteract acquired immunodeficiences.  Some studies also suggest that melatonin might be useful fighting infectious disease including viral, such as HIV, and bacterial infections, and potentially in the treatment of cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Maestroni GJ | title = Therapeutic potential of melatonin in immunodeficiency states, viral diseases, and cancer | journal = Adv.

===Dreaming===

Some supplemental melatonin users report an increase in vivid dreaming. Extremely high doses of melatonin (50 mg) dramatically increased REM sleep time and dream activity in people both with and without narcolepsy. It has been suggested that nonpolar (lipid-soluble) indolic hallucinogenic drugs emulate melatonin activity in the awakened state and that both act on the same areas of the brain.[tpl]cite book |title=Melatonin and the Biological Clock |last=Lewis |first=Alan |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-87983-734-9 |year=1999 |page=23[/tpl]

===Aging===

Research has supported the anti-aging properties of melatonin.

Some studies have shown that melatonin plays a crucial part in the aging process and that it may act as an anti-aging agent when administered to older mice. It has been reported in one study that administration of melatonin in elderly mice may reverse this change in expression of some 13 genes, thus making them similar to those of younger mice.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sharman EH, Sharman KG, Ge YW, Lahiri DK, Bondy SC | title = Age-related changes in murine CNS mRNA gene expression are modulated by dietary melatonin | journal = J.

===Pediatrics===

While the packaging of melatonin often warns against use in children, at least one long-term study does assess effectiveness and safety in children.  No serious safety concerns were noted in any of the 94 cases studied by means of a structured questionnaire for the parents.  With a mean follow-up time of 3.7 years, long-term medication was effective against sleep onset problems in 88% of the cases.

A 2004 review found that melatonin significantly increased total sleep time in people suffering from sleep restriction.
For many types of sleep disorders, melatonin is not effective.  A 2006 review found that although it is safe for short term use (of three months or less), there is "no evidence that melatonin is effective in treating secondary sleep disorders or sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction, such as jet lag and shiftwork disorder."[tpl]cite journal | author = Buscemi N, Vandermeer B, Hooton N, Pandya R, Tjosvold L, Hartling L, Vohra S, Klassen TP, Baker G | title = Efficacy and safety of exogenous melatonin for secondary sleep disorders and sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction: meta-analysis | journal = BMJ | volume = 332 | issue = 7538 | pages = 385–93 |date=February 2006 | pmid = 16473858 | pmc = 1370968 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38731.532766.F6 [/tpl]

===Circadian rhythm disorders===

Exogenous melatonin taken in the evening is, together with light therapy upon awakening, the standard treatment for delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) and non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder where circadian rhythms are not entrained to the environmental cycle.  It appears to have some use against other circadian rhythm sleep disorders as well, such as jet lag and the problems of people who work rotating or night shifts.  Melatonin reduces sleep onset latency to a greater extent in people with DSPD than in people with insomnia.[tpl]cite journal | author = Buscemi N, Vandermeer B, Pandya R, Hooton N, Tjosvold L, Hartling L, Baker G, Vohra S, Klassen T | title = Melatonin for treatment of sleep disorders | journal = Evidence Report/Technology Assessment (Summary) | volume = | issue = 108 | pages = 1–7 |date=November 2004 | pmid = 15635761 | doi = | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK37431/ [/tpl]

Light therapy may advance the phase about one to two-and-a-half hours and an oral dose of 0.3 or 3 mg of melatonin, timed correctly some hours before bedtime, can add about 30 minutes to the ~2 hour advance achieved with light therapy. There was no difference in the average magnitude of phase shift induced by the 2 doses.[tpl]cite journal | author = Mundey K, Benloucif S, Harsanyi K, Dubocovich ML, Zee PC | title = Phase-dependent treatment of delayed sleep phase syndrome with melatonin | journal = Sleep | volume = 28 | issue = 10 | pages = 1271–8 |date=October 2005 | pmid = 16295212 | doi = [/tpl]

===Learning, memory and Alzheimer's===

Melatonin receptors appear to be important in mechanisms of learning and memory in mice,[tpl]cite journal | author = Larson J, Jessen RE, Uz T, Arslan AD, Kurtuncu M, Imbesi M, Manev H | title = Impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation in melatonin MT2 receptor-deficient mice | journal = Neurosci.

The first published evidence that melatonin may be useful in Alzheimer's disease was the demonstration that this neurohormone prevents neuronal death caused by exposure to the amyloid beta protein, a neurotoxic substance that accumulates in the brains of patients with the disorder.[tpl]cite journal | author = Pappolla MA, Sos M, Omar RA, Bick RJ, Hickson-Bick DL, Reiter RJ, Efthimiopoulos S, Robakis NK | title = Melatonin prevents death of neuroblastoma cells exposed to the Alzheimer amyloid peptide | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 1683–90 |date=March 1997 | pmid = 9030627 | doi =  [/tpl] Melatonin also inhibits the aggregation of the amyloid beta protein into neurotoxic microaggregates that, it seems, underlie the neurotoxicity of this protein, causing death of neurons and formation of neurofibrillary tangles, the other neuropathological landmark of Alzheimer's disease.[tpl]cite journal | author = Pappolla M, Bozner P, Soto C, Shao H, Robakis NK, Zagorski M, Frangione B, Ghiso J | title = Inhibition of Alzheimer beta-fibrillogenesis by melatonin | journal = J.

Melatonin has been shown to prevent the hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein in rats. Hyperphosphorylation of tau protein can also result in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Studies in rats suggest that melatonin may be effective for treating Alzheimer's disease.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wang XC, Zhang J, Yu X, Han L, Zhou ZT, Zhang Y, Wang JZ | title = Prevention of isoproterenol-induced tau hyperphosphorylation by melatonin in the rat | journal = Sheng Li Xue Bao | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–12 |date=February 2005 | pmid = 15719129 | doi = [/tpl] These same neurofibrillary tangles can be found in the hypothalamus in patients with Alzheimer's, adversely affecting their bodies' production of melatonin. Another study has implicated heightened afternoon agitation found in many Alzheimer's patients, called sundowning, with a phase delay in core body temperature.[tpl]cite journal | author = Volicer L, Harper DG, Manning BC, Goldstein R, Satlin A | title = Sundowning and circadian rhythms in Alzheimer's disease | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 158 | issue = 5 | pages = 704–11 |date=May 2001 | pmid = 11329390 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.5.704 [/tpl] This may suggest a possible connection to melatonin production.

===Gallbladder stones===

Melatonin presence in the gallbladder has many protective properties, such as converting cholesterol to bile, preventing oxidative stress, and increasing the mobility of gallstones from the gallbladder.[tpl]cite journal | author = Koppisetti S, Jenigiri B, Terron MP, Tengattini S, Tamura H, Flores LJ, Tan DX, Reiter RJ | title = Reactive oxygen species and the hypomotility of the gall bladder as targets for the treatment of gallstones with melatonin: a review | journal = Dig.

In guinea pigs, melatonin administration restored normal function by reducing inflammation after induced cholecystitis, whether administered before or after onset of inflammation. Concentration of melatonin in the bile is 2–3 times higher than the otherwise very low daytime melatonin levels in the blood across many diurnal mammals, including humans.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tan D, Manchester LC, Reiter RJ, Qi W, Hanes MA, Farley NJ | title = High physiological levels of melatonin in the bile of mammals | journal = Life Sci. | volume = 65 | issue = 23 | pages = 2523–9 |date=October 1999 | pmid = 10622237 | doi = 10.1016/S0024-3205(99)00519-6 [/tpl]

===Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis===

In animal models, melatonin has been shown to ameliorate glutamate-induced neuronal death, it is presumed due to its antioxidant effects. In a clinical safety study involving 31 ALS patients, high-dose rectal melatonin (300 mg/day for 2 years) was shown to be tolerated well.[tpl]cite journal | author = Weishaupt JH, Bartels C, Pölking E, Dietrich J, Rohde G, Poeggeler B, Mertens N, Sperling S, Bohn M, Hüther G, Schneider A, Bach A, Sirén AL, Hardeland R, Bähr M, Nave KA, Ehrenreich H | title = Reduced oxidative damage in ALS by high-dose enteral melatonin treatment | journal = J.

===Obesity===

Melatonin is involved in energy metabolism and body weight control in small animals.

The mechanism of melatonin in protection against ionizing radiation is thought to involve scavenging of free radicals. It is estimated that nearly 70% of biological damage caused by ionizing radiation is attributable to the free radical, especially the hydroxyl radical that attacks DNA, proteins, and cellular membranes. Melatonin has been suggested as a radioprotective agent, with the proposed advantages of being broadly protective, readily available, orally self-administered, and without major known side effects.[tpl]cite journal | author = Shirazi A, Ghobadi G, Ghazi-Khansari M | title = A radiobiological review on melatonin: a novel radioprotector | journal = J.

===Other===

Melatonin was used to treat periodic limb movement disorder, a common neurological condition, which, when severe, adversely affects sleep and causes excessive daytime fatigue, in a small trial conducted by Kunz D and Bes F.  In this condition, the sufferer is affected by mini arousals during sleep and limb movements that occur in a frequent rhythmic fashion.  This often involves leg kicking, but sometimes also involves arm movement.  Those affected are often not aware of the condition, and partners are often the first to notice the condition. 7 out of the 9 participants in the trial showed significant improvement.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kunz D, Bes F | title = Exogenous melatonin in periodic limb movement disorder: an open clinical trial and a hypothesis | journal = Sleep | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–7 |date=March 2001 | pmid = 11247054 | doi = [/tpl]

==Adverse effects==

Melatonin appears to cause very few side-effects in the short term, up to three months, when healthy people take it at low doses. A systematic review in 2006 looked specifically at efficacy and safety in two categories of melatonin usage: first, for sleep disturbances that are secondary to other diagnoses and, second, for sleep disorders such as jet lag and shift work that accompany sleep restriction.
The study concluded that "There is no evidence that melatonin is effective in treating secondary sleep disorders or sleep disorders accompanying sleep restriction, such as jet lag and shiftwork disorder. There is evidence that melatonin is safe with short term use".
A similar analysis by the same team a year earlier on the efficacy and safety of exogenous melatonin in the management of primary sleep disorders found that: "There is evidence to suggest that melatonin is safe with short-term use (3 months or less)."

==Availability==

Legal availability of melatonin varies in different countries, ranging from being available without prescription (e.g. in most of North America and Finland) to being available only on prescription (e.g. in the UK) or not at all (although its possession and use may not be illegal). It is widely available on the Internet.
The hormone may be administered orally, as capsules, tablets or liquid, sublingually, or as transdermal patches.
The use of melatonin derived from animal pineal tissue may carry the risk of contamination or the means of transmitting viral material. The synthetic form of this medication does not carry this risk.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/melatonin.html |title=Melatonin| publisher=Drugs.com| accessdate=2011-08-17[/tpl]

===Dietary supplement===

In the US it is sold as a dietary supplement (sometimes combined with other ingredients, such as vitamins and herbal extracts) and not as a drug.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations applying to medications are not applicable to melatonin. However, new FDA rules required that by June 2010 all production of dietary supplements must comply with "current good manufacturing practices" (cGMP) and be manufactured with "controls that result in a consistent product free of contamination, with accurate labeling."[tpl]cite press release | title = FDA Issues Dietary Supplements Final Rule | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | date = 2007-06-22 | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm108938.htm | accessdate = 2009-08-04[/tpl] The industry has also been required to report to the FDA "all serious dietary supplement related adverse events", and the FDA has (within the cGMP guidelines) begun enforcement of that requirement.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/75250.php | title = FDA Tightens Up Dietary Supplement Manufacturing And Labelling | website= Medical News Today | accessdate = 2 September 2013 | date = 26 June 2007[/tpl]

The FDA is considering whether these food products can continue to be sold with the label "dietary supplements". On January 13, 2010, they issued a warning letter to Innovative Beverage, creators of several beverages marketed as "relaxation drinks," stating that melatonin is not approved as a food additive because it is not generally recognized as safe.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm201435.htm | title =Warning Letter | author = Rodriguez RR | date = January 13, 2010 | work = Inspections, Compliance, Enforcement, and Criminal Investigations | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration [/tpl]

===Prolonged release===

Melatonin is available as a prolonged-release prescription drug, trade-name Circadin, manufactured by Neurim Pharmaceuticals. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved Circadin 2 mg (prolonged-release melatonin) for patients aged 55 or over, as monotherapy for the short-term treatment (up to 13 weeks) of primary insomnia characterized by poor quality of sleep.Medical News Today Circadin (Prolonged-Release Melatonin) For Primary Insomnia Recommended For Approval In The EU (27 Apr 2007)
