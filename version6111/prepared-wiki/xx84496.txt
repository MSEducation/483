CATEGORIES: Reconstruction Era, Departments and districts of the United States Army, Military government

The 5th Military District was a temporary administrative unit of the United States set up during the Reconstruction period following the American Civil War.  It included Texas, from Brazos Santiago Harbor, (previously Port Matamoros), at the Mexican border, north to Louisiana.  General Philip Sheridan served as its first military governor, until removed by U.S. President Andrew Johnson because of a charge of excessive harshness in Sheridan's treatment of former Confederate soldiers. He was replaced by Charles Griffin, then by Joseph J. Reynolds.
Several incidents committed against negro federal soldiers at Ft. Brown in Brownsville, Texas noted, and elsewhere by Jayhawkers, wild Indians, desperados, etc.  Most incident reports fail to identify the perpetrators.
