The United States Basketball League ([tpl]otcbb|USBL[/tpl]), often abbreviated to the USBL, was a professional men's spring basketball league. The league was formed in 1985. The final champions are the Kansas Cagerz, who won the title game on July 1, 2007.

==History==

The USBL started in 1985 as one of the first basketball leagues to play a late-spring to early-summer schedule.  The league quickly became known as a development league for players, with many players moving up to the NBA and many more playing in Europe after stints here.  In 1996, the league made a stock offering, a rarity among sports leagues.  However, in later years, the league declined as rival leagues appeared and USBL had a tougher time replacing teams that folded.  In the last two seasons, the league was mainly a midwestern league, with teams mainly in Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma.
