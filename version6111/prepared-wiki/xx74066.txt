Benjamin Peirce ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɜr|s[/tpl];"Peirce", in the case of Benjamin Peirce and family, always rhymes with "terse" and so, in most dialects, is pronounced like the word "[tpl]Audio|en-us-purse.ogg|purse[/tpl]". See "Note on the Pronunciation of 'Peirce'", The Peirce Edition Project Newsletter, Vol. 1, Nos. 3/4, Dec. 1994, Eprint. April 4, 1809 – October 6, 1880) was an American mathematician who taught at Harvard University for approximately 50 years. He made contributions to celestial mechanics, statistics, number theory, algebra, and the philosophy of mathematics.
He was the son of Benjamin Peirce (1778–1831), later librarian of Harvard, and Lydia Ropes Nichols Peirce (1781–1868).[tpl]cite book|author1=Rossiter Johnson|author2=John Howard Brown|title=The twentieth century biographical dictionary of notable Americans ...|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ve0UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT269|accessdate=28 August 2011|year=1904|publisher=The Biographical Society|pages=269–[/tpl]
After graduating from Harvard, he remained as a tutor (1829), and was subsequently appointed professor of mathematics in 1831. He added astronomy to his portfolio in 1842, and remained as Harvard professor until his death. In addition, he was instrumental in the development of Harvard's science curriculum, served as the college  librarian, and was director of the U.S. Coast Survey from 1867 to 1874.

==Research==

Benjamin Peirce is often regarded as the earliest American scientist whose research was recognized as world class. He was an apologist for slavery opining that it should be condoned if it was used to allow an elite to pursue scientific enquiry.[tpl]cite journal|last=Auspitz|first=Josiah Lee|title=The Wasp Leaves the Bottle: Charles Sanders Peirce|journal=The American Scholar|year=1994|month=Autumn|volume=63|issue=4|pages=602–618|url=http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/auspitz/escape.htm[/tpl]

===Mathematics===

In number theory, he proved there is no odd perfect number with fewer than four prime factors.
In algebra, he was notable for the study of associative algebras. He first introduced the terms idempotent and nilpotent in 1870 to describe elements of these algebras, and he also introduced the Peirce decomposition.

====Definition of mathematics====

In the philosophy of mathematics, he became known for the statement that "Mathematics is the science that draws necessary conclusions".First line of Linear Associative Algebra Peirce's definition of mathematics was credited by his son, Charles Sanders Peirce, as helping to initiate the consequentialist philosophy of pragmatism.
Like George Boole, Peirce believed that mathematics could be used to study logic. These ideas were developed by Charles Sanders Peirce, who noted that logic also includes the study of faulty reasoning.
In contrast, the later logicist program of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell attempted to base mathematics on logic.

===Statistics===

Peirce proposed what came to be known as Peirce's Criterion for the statistical treatment of outliers, that is, of apparently extreme observations. His ideas were developed by Charles Sanders Peirce.Theory of Errors of Observation
Peirce was an expert witness in the Howland will forgery trial, where he was assisted by his son Charles Sanders Peirce. Their analysis of the questioned signature showed that it resembled another particular handwriting example so closely that the chances of such a match were statistically extremely remote.

==Private life==

He was devoutly religious, though he seldom published his theological thoughts.Grattan-Guinness, Ivor and Walsh, Alison (2008), "Benjamin Peirce", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Eprint. Peirce credited God as shaping nature in ways that account for the efficacy of pure mathematics in describing empirical phenomena.Peirce, "Address of Professor Benjamin Peirce, President of the American Association for the Year 1853", Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences, Eighth Meeting  = Volume 8, held at Washington D.C., May, 1854, published 1855, pp. 1–17, see especially pp. 12–15. Google Books Eprint Peirce viewed "mathematics as study of God's work by God's creatures", according to an encyclopedia.
He married Sarah Hunt Mills, the daughter of U.S. Senator Elijah Hunt Mills.Adams, Henry. The Life of George Cabot Lodge. pp. 4–5. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1911 Peirce and his wife had four sons and one daughter:Fisch, Max H. (1981), Introduction, Writings of Charles S. Peirce v. 1.

==Eponyms==

The lunar crater Peirce is named for Peirce.
Post-doctoral positions in Harvard University's mathematics department are named in his honors as Benjamin Peirce Fellows and Lecturers.
