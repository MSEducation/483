Kylie Ann Minogue, OBE ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aɪ|l|iː|_|m|ɨ|ˈ|n|oʊ|ɡ[/tpl]; born 28 May 1968), often known simply as Kylie, is an Australian singer-songwriter and actress, working and living in London. After beginning her career as a child actress on Australian television, she achieved recognition through her role in the television soap opera Neighbours, before beginning her career as a recording artist in 1987.
Minogue has achieved worldwide record sales of more than 70 million,[tpl]cite web|title=Kylie Minogue To Be Honored With Australia's Top Live Entertainment Award|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1568570/kylie-minogue-to-be-honored-with-australias-top-live-entertainment-award|work=Billboard|accessdate=23 November 2013|date=28 June 2013[/tpl] and has received notable music awards, including multiple ARIA and Brit Awards and a Grammy Award. She has mounted several successful and critically acclaimed concert world tours and received a Mo Award for "Australian Entertainer of the Year" for her live performances. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2008 "for services to music". In the same year she was appointed by the French Government as a Chevalier (knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, the junior grade of France's highest cultural honour, for her contribution to the enrichment of French culture. In 2011 her hit single "I Should Be So Lucky" was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia's Sounds of Australia registry.National Film and Sound Archive: 'I Should Be So Lucky' on the Sounds of Australia registryNational Film and Sound Archive: 'I Should Be So Lucky' on australianscreen online The same year, Minogue was awarded an honorary Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) degree by Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom for her work in raising awareness for breast cancer. In November 2011, on the 25th anniversary of the ARIA Music Awards, Minogue was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame.Daily Telegraph (Australia).

Her first single, "The Loco-Motion", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles chart and became the highest-selling single of the decade in Australia. This led to a contract with the British songwriters and producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. Her debut album, Kylie (1988), and the single "I Should Be So Lucky", both performed well on international charts, particularly in Australia and the United Kingdom. Initially presented as a "girl next door", Minogue attempted to convey a more mature style in her music and public image. Her singles were well received, but after four albums her sales were declining, and she left Stock, Aitken & Waterman in 1992 to establish herself as an independent performer. Her next single, "Confide in Me", reached number one in Australia and was a hit in several European countries in 1994, and a duet with Nick Cave, "Where the Wild Roses Grow", brought Minogue a greater degree of artistic credibility. Drawing inspiration from a range of musical styles and artists, Minogue took creative control over the songwriting for her next album, Impossible Princess (1997).
Minogue returned to prominence in 2000 with the single "Spinning Around" and the dance-oriented album Light Years, and she performed during the closing ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Her music videos showed a more sexually provocative and flirtatious personality and several hit singles followed. "Can't Get You Out of My Head" reached number one in more than 40 countries, and the album Fever (2001) was a hit in many countries, including the US, a market in which Minogue had previously received little recognition. In 2005, in the middle of a concert tour, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, forcing her to cancel the tour. After treatment, she resumed her career in 2006 with the Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour. In 2009, she embarked upon her For You, For Me tour, her first concert tour of the US and Canada.
In 2014 Minogue released her 12th album Kiss Me Once, while also appearing as a judge on the third series of The Voice UK and the third series of The Voice Australia. Minogue later confirmed that she would not be returning to The Voice UK for the fourth series due to the dates clashing with her tour.http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s154/the-voice-uk/news/a564029/the-voice-uk-kylie-minogue-confirms-exit-blames-tour-dates.html

The Minogue sisters began their careers as children on Australian television. From the age of 11, Kylie appeared in small roles in soap operas such as The Sullivans and Skyways, and in 1985 was cast in one of the lead roles in The Henderson Kids.[tpl]Cite news| last = Wearring| first = Miles| title = Kylie's life on screen | work = Herald Sun | date = 28 May 2008| url = http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,26278,23769961-10388,00.html| accessdate =26 July 2009[/tpl] Interested in following a career in music, she made a demo tape for the producers of the weekly music programme Young Talent Time,[tpl]Cite news| last = Adams| first = Cameron| title = Kylie Minogue – 20 years on | work=Herald Sun| date = 2 August 2007| url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22171653-2902,00.html| accessdate =27 July 2009[/tpl] which featured Dannii as a regular performer.Smith, p. 16 Kylie gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985 but was not invited to join the cast. Dannii's success overshadowed Kylie's acting achievements, until Kylie was cast in the soap opera Neighbours in 1986, as Charlene Mitchell, a schoolgirl turned garage mechanic. Neighbours achieved popularity in the UK, and a story arc that created a romance between her character and the character played by Jason Donovan, culminated in a wedding episode in 1987 that attracted an audience of 20 million British viewers.[tpl]Cite news| last = Simpson| first = Aislinn| title = Kylie Minogue celebrates 40th birthday |work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | date = 27 May 2008| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/2036175/Kylie-Minogue-celebrates-40th-birthday.html| accessdate =26 July 2009[/tpl]
Her popularity in Australia was demonstrated when she became the first person to win four Logie Awards in one event, and the youngest recipient of the "Gold Logie" as the country's "Most Popular Television Performer", with the result determined by public vote.[tpl]cite web| title = The Logies | publisher=TelevisionAU | url = http://www.televisionau.com/logies.htm | accessdate =26 January 2006[/tpl]

===1987–89: Kylie and Enjoy Yourself===

During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed "I Got You Babe" as a duet with the actor John Waters, and "The Loco-Motion" as an encore, and was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987.Smith, p. 18 Her first single, "The Loco-Motion", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and it became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s.[tpl]Cite news| last = Maley| first = Jacqueline| title = 20 years at the top: she should be so lucky |work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date = 5 August 2007| url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/she-should-be-so-lucky/2007/08/04/1185648204390.html| accessdate =26 July 2009[/tpl] She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single.[tpl]cite web| title = 1988: 2nd Annual ARIA Awards| url = http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history/year/1988| publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association| accessdate =5 June 2012[/tpl] Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote "I Should Be So Lucky" while she waited outside the studio.[tpl]cite web| title = Transcript of television documentary Love Is in the Air, episode title "I Should Be So Lucky" | publisher=ABC Television | date = 2 November 2003 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/tv/love/episodes/transcript4.htm | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abc.net.au%2Ftv%2Flove%2Fepisodes%2Ftranscript4.htm&date=2011-02-02 | archivedate = 2 February 2011 | accessdate =26 January 2006[/tpl] The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong.Smith, p. 219 Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a "Special Achievement Award".[tpl]cite web| title = 1989: 3rd Annual ARIA Awards| url = http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history/year/1989| publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association| accessdate =6 June 2012[/tpl]
Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and it spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one.Brown, Kutner, Warwick, pp. 673–674 The album went gold in the United States, and the single, "The Loco-Motion", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart,[tpl]cite web| title = Kylie Minogue, Chart History, Hot 100| url = [tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=kylie minogue|chart=all[/tpl]|work=Billboard | accessdate =25 July 2009[/tpl] and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart.

Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song "Especially for You". It peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and sold almost one million copies.

Minogue's second album Enjoy Yourself was released in October 1989. The album was a success in the United Kingdom, Europe, New Zealand, Asia and Australia. The album spawned number one singles "Hand on Your Heart" and "Tears on My Pillow". However, the album failed to sell well throughout North America, and Minogue was dropped by her American record label Geffen Records. She then embarked on her first concert tour, the Enjoy Yourself Tour, in the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and Australia in February 1990. She was also one of the featured vocalists on the remake of "Do They Know It's Christmas?".Smith, p. 220
Her debut film, The Delinquents was released in December 1989. The movie was poorly received by critics but it proved popular with audiences.

===1990–92: Rhythm of Love and Let's Get to It===

Minogue's third album, Rhythm of Love was released in November 1990. The album presented a more sophisticated and adult style of dance music and also marked the first signs of her rebellion against her production team and the "girl-next-door" image.Baker and Minogue, p. 29 Determined to be accepted by a more mature audience, Minogue took control of her music videos, starting with "Better the Devil You Know", and presented herself as a sexually aware adult.Baker and Minogue, p. 32 Her relationship with Michael Hutchence was also seen as part of her departure from her earlier persona.[tpl]Cite news| last =McLuckie| first =Kirsty| title =Dating Danger|work=The Scotsman |location=UK| date =23 January 2003| url =http://news.scotsman.com/kylieminogue/Call-it-chemistry-Kylie-Minogue.2293601.jp| accessdate =26 January 2006[/tpl] The singles from Rhythm of Love sold well in Europe and Australia. She then later embarked on the Rhythm of Love Tour in February 1991.
Minogue's fourth album, Let's Get to It was released in October 1991 and it reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. It was her first album to fail to reach the top ten. While the first single from the album, "Word Is Out" became her first single to miss the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, though subsequent singles "If You Were with Me Now" and "Give Me Just a Little More Time" reached the top five respectively. In support of the album, she embarked on the Let's Get to It Tour in October. She had fulfilled the requirements of her contract and elected not to renew it. She later expressed her opinion that she was stifled by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, and said, "I was very much a puppet in the beginning. I was blinkered by my record company. I was unable to look left or right."Shuker, p. 164
Minogue's first Greatest Hits album was released in August 1992. It reached number one in the United Kingdom and number three in Australia.[tpl]cite web| title = Kylie Minogue: Greatest Hits (album)| publisher=Media Jungen| url = http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Kylie+Minogue&titel=Greatest+Hits&cat=a| accessdate =26 July 2009[/tpl] The singles from the album, "What Kind of Fool" and her cover version of Kool & the Gang's "Celebration" both reached the top twenty of the UK Singles Chart.

===1993–98: Kylie Minogue and Impossible Princess===

Minogue's signing with Deconstruction Records was highly touted in the music media as the beginning of a new phase in her career. Her fifth album Kylie Minogue was released in September 1994 which sold well in Europe and Australia. It was produced by dance music producers the Brothers In Rhythm, namely Dave Seaman and Steve Anderson (musician) who had previously produced Finer_Feelings, her last single with PWL. Anderson remains Minogue's musical director to this day.  The lead single "Confide in Me" spent four weeks at number one on Australian singles chart.[tpl]cite web| title = Kylie Minogue: Confide In Me (song)| publisher=Media Jungen| url = http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Kylie+Minogue&titel=Confide+In+Me&cat=s| accessdate =26 July 2009[/tpl] The next two singles from the album "Put Yourself in My Place" and "Where Is the Feeling?" reached the top twenty of the UK Singles Chart, while the album peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart, eventually selling 250,000 copies.Sutherland and Ellis, p. 51
During this period, Minogue made a guest appearance as herself, in an episode of the comedy The Vicar of Dibley. Director Steven E. de Souza was intrigued by Minogue's cover photo in Australia's Who Magazine as one of "The 30 Most Beautiful People in the World", and offered her a role opposite Jean-Claude Van Damme in the film Street Fighter.Smith, p. 152 The film was a moderate success, earning US$70 million in the US, but received poor reviews with The Washington Post's Richard Harrington calling Minogue "the worst actress in the English-speaking world". She then co-starred with Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin in the 1996 film Bio-Dome. She also appeared in the 1995 short film, Hayride to Hell and in the 1996 film Diana & Me.

In 1995, Minogue collaborated with Australian artist Nick Cave for the song "Where the Wild Roses Grow". Cave had been interested in working with Minogue since hearing "Better the Devil You Know", saying it contained "one of pop music's most violent and distressing lyrics".Baker and Minogue, p. 99 The music video for the song was inspired by John Everett Millais's painting Ophelia (1851–1852), and showed Minogue as the murdered woman, floating in a pond as a serpent swam over her body. The single received widespread attention in Europe, where it reached the top 10 in several countries, and number two in Australia.[tpl]cite web| title = Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds and Kylie Minogue: Where The Wild Roses Grow (song)| publisher=Media Jungen| url = http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Nick+Cave+%26+The+Bad+Seeds+%2B+Kylie+Minogue&titel=Where+The+Wild+Roses+Grow&cat=s| accessdate =26 July 2009[/tpl] The song won ARIA Awards for "Song of the Year" and "Best Pop Release".[tpl]cite web| title = 1996: 10th Annual ARIA Awards| url = http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history/year/1996| publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association| accessdate =6 June 2012[/tpl] Following concert appearances with Cave, she recited the lyrics to "I Should Be So Lucky" as poetry in London's Royal Albert Hall.Baker and Minogue, p. 112
By 1997, Minogue was in a relationship with the French photographer Stéphane Sednaoui, who encouraged her to develop her creativity.Baker and Minogue, pp. 107–112 Inspired by a mutual appreciation of Japanese culture, they created a visual combination of "geisha and manga superheroine" for the photographs taken for Minogue's sixth album Impossible Princess and the video for "German Bold Italic", Minogue's collaboration with Towa Tei.Baker and Minogue, pp. 108–109 She drew inspiration from the music of artists such as Shirley Manson and Garbage, Björk, Tricky and U2, and Japanese pop musicians such as Pizzicato Five and Towa Tei.Baker and Minogue, p. 108 The album featured collaborations with musicians such as James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore of the Manic Street Preachers. Mostly a dance album, Minogue countered suggestions that she was trying to become an indie artist.[tpl]cite web| last = Petridis | first = Alex | title = Kylie Chameleon |work=Mixmag (UK) |date=October 1997 | url = http://www.kylie.co.uk/press/00000002.shtml | accessdate =20 January 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927003157/http://www.kylie.co.uk/press/00000002.shtml |archivedate = 27 September 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Acknowledging that she had attempted to escape the perceptions of her that had developed during her early career, she commented that she was ready to "forget the painful criticism" and "accept the past, embrace it, use it". The music video for "Did It Again" paid homage to her earlier incarnations.Baker and Minogue, p. 113 Retitled Kylie Minogue in the UK following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, it became the lowest-selling album of her career. At the end of the year a campaign by Virgin Radio stated, "We've done something to improve Kylie's records: we've banned them." In Australia, the album was a success where it spent 35 weeks on the album chart.[tpl]cite web| title = Kylie Minogue – Impossible Princess (album)| publisher=Media Jungen| url = http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Kylie+Minogue&titel=Impossible+Princess&cat=a| accessdate =26 July 2009[/tpl]
Minogue's Intimate and Live tour of 1998 was extended due to demand.Baker and Minogue, p. 125 The Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett, hosted a civic reception for Minogue in Melbourne,Baker and Minogue, p. 127 and she maintained her high profile in Australia with live performances, including the 1998 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, the opening ceremonies of Melbourne's Crown Casino,Baker and Minogue, p. 129 and Sydney's Fox Studios in 1999, where she performed Marilyn Monroe's "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend",[tpl]cite web| title =Kylie: Top 10 Live Performances| publisher=Media Jungen| url = http://sydney.citysearch.com.au/music/1137592126005/Kylie:+Top+10+Live+Performances| accessdate =26 July 2009[/tpl] and a Christmas concert in Dili, East Timor, in association with the United Nations Peace-Keeping Forces. During this time she filmed a small role for the Australian-made Molly Ringwald 2000 film Cut.

After Minogue parted ways with Deconstruction Records, she performed a duet with the Pet Shop Boys' on their Nightlife album and spent several months in Barbados performing in Shakespeare's The Tempest.Baker and Minogue, p. 146 She then appeared in the film Sample People and recorded a cover version of Russell Morris's "The Real Thing" for the soundtrack. In April 1999, she signed with Parlophone Records.Baker and Minogue, p. 145 Parlophone wanted to re-establish Minogue as the pop artist they felt she essentially was, but that had been lost.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Miles_Leonard_Int.html |title=Interview with Miles Leonard |publisher= Hit Quarters |date=21 February 2002 |accessdate=16 February 2011[/tpl]

===Music and voice===

Minogue has been known for her soft Soprano vocal range, which has been noted as "a pleasant soft, breathy quality, and the head notes have a warm and versatile timbre."Divadevotee | Kylie Minogue- Vocal Profile/ Range (by request). She has approximately a range of 3.5 octaves.

In musical terms, Minogue has worked with many genres in pop and dance music. However, her signature or suitable music has been contemporary disco music. Her first studio album's with Stock, Aitken, and Waterman present a more bubblegum pop influence where many critics had compared her to American recording artist Madonna. According to Chris True from Allmusic, he reviewed her debut Kylie and found her music "standard late-'80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum", however he stated that she presented the most personality of any 1980s recording artist.Kylie | Kylie Minogue. AllMusic. When her third album Rhythm of Love was served in the early 1990s, "The songwriting is stronger, the production dynamic, and Kylie seems more confident vocally."Rhythm of Love | Kylie Minogue. AllMusic. At the time of her third studio album, "She began to trade in her cutesy, bubblegum pop image for a more mature one, and in turn, a more sexual one." Chris True stated that when she had her relationship with Michael Hutchence, "her shedding of the near-virginal façade that dominated her first two albums, began to have an effect, not only on how the press and her fans treated her, but in the evolution of her music."Kylie Minogue >> Overview. AllMusic.
However, Minogue's work on her sixth studio album Impossible Princess, her songwriting and musical content started to change. She was constantly writing down words, exploring the form and meaning of sentences.Baker and Minogue, Hodder and Stoughton, 2002. p 111. She had written lyrics before, but called them "safe, just neatly rhymed words and that's that".John Walsh. "Lucky in Luck". Vogue (magazine). November 1997. The album, in musical genres, varied from her previous efforts as it incorporated "dance-pop" and "trip-hop" music, as critics reviewed.[tpl]cite journal |last=Cinquemani |first=Sal |date=19 November 2003 |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/kylie-minogue-impossible-princess/371 |title=Kylie Minogue: Impossible Princess |work= Slant Magazine |accessdate=30 January 2009[/tpl] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine had written that the album bears a resemblance to Madonna's Ray of Light. He continued that she took inspiration of " both the Brit-pop and electronica movements of the mid-'90s" and "Impossible Princess is the work of an artist willing to take risks". Her next effort Light Years; "worked up by the renaissance of pure dance-pop that was the order of the day at the onset of the 21st century." Her ninth album Body Language was quite different from her musical experiments in the past as it was a "successful" attempt at broadening her sound with electro and hip-hop for instance. With its incorporating styles of dance music with funk, disco and R&B,Kylie – Body Language. NME. the album managed to be listed on Q's "Best Albums of 2003"."Q magazine Recordings Of The Year – 2003". Rocklist.net. Retrieved 4 December 2009.
Her tenth record X was a more welcome back to Minogue's pop roots. In a press interview for the promotion of the album, Minogue herself stated that the album was "mainly electropop" and was a "celebration for me Minogue to be back working.""Kylie in Japanese TV – Interview – 22 January 2008".

Tim Sendra from Allmusic stated "The various producers keep their eyes on the dancefloor throughout, crafting shiny and sleek tracks that sound custom-built to blast out of huge speaker columns" and found Aphrodite "One of her best, in fact."[tpl]cite web |last=Sendra |first=Tim |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/aphrodite-mw0001999355 |title=Aphrodite – Kylie Minogue |publisher=AllMusic.

===Public image===

Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not "paid her dues" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours. Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, "if you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go."
In 1993, Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to the photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism.Baker and Minogue, p. 50 During her career Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new "look" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad group of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested that this is part of the reason she has entered in the mainstream pop culture of Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.Baker and Minogue, p. 165
By 2000, when Minogue returned to prominence, she was considered to be have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected.Copley, p. 128 Her progression from the wholesome "girl next door" to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans to her. Her "Spinning Around" video led to some media outlets referring to her as "SexKylie", and sex became a stronger element in her subsequent videos. William Baker described her status as a sex symbol as a "double edged sword" observing that "we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record. But now it has become in danger of eclipsing what she actually is: a pop singer."Baker and Minogue, p. 211. After 20 years as a performer, Minogue was described as a fashion "trend-setter" and a "style icon who constantly reinvents herself".[tpl]Cite news|first= Fiona |last = Pryor| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6336337.stm |title=Discovering Kylie's style secrets |publisher=BBC News |date=6 February 2007|accessdate=8 August 2009[/tpl] She has been acknowledged for mounting successful tours, and for worldwide record sales of more than 70 million.[tpl]cite web|first= Iley |last = Chrissy| url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/kylie-minogue-interview-state-of-bliss-1-1354482 |title=Kylie Minogue interview: State of Bliss |work=Scotland on Sunday |date=9 July 2009|accessdate=8 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last = Webster| first = Philip | title = Kylie Minogue and Michael Parkinson lead list with heroes of summer floods |work=The Times | location=London | date = 29 December 2007| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3105760.ece| accessdate =26 March 2008[/tpl]
Minogue has been inspired by and compared to Madonna throughout her career. Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue during the early years of her success with the observation: "She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna ... What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her." Minogue received negative comments that her Rhythm of Love tour in 1991 was too similar visually to Madonna's Blond Ambition World Tour of the previous year for which the critics labelled her a Madonna wannabe.Baker and Minogue, p. 58 Kathy McCabe for The Telegraph notes that Minogue and Madonna follow similar styles in music and fashion,[tpl]Cite news| last = McCabe| first = Kathy| title = Kylie and Madonna strut a similar stage, but are they poles apart?|work=The Daily Telegraph| date = 24 November 2007| url =http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/kylie-or-madonna-whos-queen/story-fna7dq6e-1111114952055| accessdate =25 July 2009[/tpl] and concludes, "Where they truly diverge on the pop-culture scale is in shock value. Minogue's clips might draw a gasp from some but Madonna's ignite religious and political debate unlike any other artist on the planet ... Simply, Madonna is the dark force; Kylie is the light force." Rolling Stone comments that, with the exception of the US, Minogue is regarded throughout the world as "an icon to rival Madonna", and says, "Like Madonna, Minogue was not a virtuosic singer but a canny trend spotter."[tpl]cite web|last= Kemp |first = Rob| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/kylieminogue/biography | title=Kylie Minogue biography | work=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide | year=2004 | accessdate=5 August 2009|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071224105839/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/kylieminogue/biography |archivedate = 24 December 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Minogue has said of Madonna, "Her huge influence on the world, in pop and fashion, meant that I wasn't immune to the trends she created.

There's been no tragedy in my life, only tragic outfits" and "My gay audience has been with me from the beginning ... they kind of adopted me."
