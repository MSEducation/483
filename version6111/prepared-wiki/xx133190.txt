The Data Interchange Standards Association (DISA) is the institution responsible for the development of cross-industry electronic business interchange standards.
DISA serves as the Secretariat for ANSI ASC X12 and their X12 EDI and XML standards development process.  
The Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 develops and maintains the most widely implemented EDI standards. These standards interface with a multitude of e-commerce technologies and serve as the premier tool for integrating e-commerce applications. Through the X12 Committee's standards and active participation in emerging and relevant technical initiatives (XML, ebXML), they foster cross-industry consensus and set the norm for more effective data exchange.
