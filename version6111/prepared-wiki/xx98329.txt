The Chicago Illinois Temple is the thirty-fifth temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).  It is the second of three church temples that have been built in Illinois (The first and the third being the Nauvoo Temple and the Nauvoo Illinois Temple).  Located in the Chicago suburb of Glenview, the site of Chicago Illinois Temple was dedicated on August 13, 1983 by Gordon B. Hinckley, a member of the church's First Presidency.  The structure itself was constructed in Gray buff marble and its roof features gray slate.  Architects used a revolutionary design for LDS temples, adapting the traditional six-spire design and adding modern motifs. 
The Chicago temple is able to accommodate a broad spectrum of church members, from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds as Spanish, Polish, Korean and other Asian cultures, as well as members who are deaf. Construction of the temple also allowed local Latter-day Saints to contribute their means, talents, and time. Children donated pennies. Young women made dolls for the temple nursery. Women crocheted and tatted altar cloths. Many donated hours in helping with the open house, held 15 Julyâ€“3 August 1985, during which over one hundred thousand people toured the temple. Hinckley dedicated the Chicago Illinois Temple on August 9, 1985. The temple now has a total of [tpl]convert|29751|sqft|m2[/tpl], five ordinance rooms, and four sealing rooms.
