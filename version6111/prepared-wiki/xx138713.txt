On the southeast of the mountain lie the ruins of Caričin Grad - Justiniana Prima, a Byzantine city from 6th century.
In summer 2010, Radan attracted media attention because of a "magnetic hill" located on a road near the village of Ivanje. After initial sensationalist articles about "anti-gravity", it soon turned out that it is just an optical illusion. Still, the hill is seen as an opportunity for a tourist attraction.[tpl]Citation|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=945069|title=Tamo gde je nebo palo dole |publisher=Vreme |date=2010-08-12 |accessdate=2010-08-19 |language=Serbian[/tpl]
