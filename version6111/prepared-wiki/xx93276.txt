Mário Coelho Pinto de Andrade (August 21, 1928 – August 26, 1990) was an Angolan poet and politician.
He was born in Golungo Alto, in Portuguese Angola, and studied philology at the University of Lisbon and sociology at the Sorbonne in Paris. While there, he became active in opposing Portuguese colonial rule of Angola, and wrote anti-colonial poetry.
In 1955 he took part in the founding of the Angolan Communist Party. In 1956 he was a founding member of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and was elected its first President in 1960.[tpl]cite web|title=Obituary|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/27/obituaries/mario-de-andrade-62-a-founder-of-angola-s-governing-movement.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl] His brother, Joaquim Pinto de Andrade, was made the MPLA's first honorary President.
He married Guadalopean filmmaker Sarah Maldoror and worked with her on the 1972 film about the Angolan liberation movement Sambizanga.
He clashed with his successor, Agostinho Neto, and in 1974 split with the MPLA, founding a new group called Revolta Activa (Active Revolt). Angola became independent on November 11, 1975, but Andrade continued to live in exile in Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and Mozambique. He died in London.
His publications included the anthologies Letteratura Negra (1961) and La Poésie Africaine d'Espression Portugaise (1969).Keith A. P. Sandiford, A Black Studies Primer: Heroes and Heroines of the African Diaspora, Hansib Publications, 2008, p. 42.
