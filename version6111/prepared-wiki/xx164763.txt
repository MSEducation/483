Vitali Dyomochka, also known as Bondar, is a Russian mobster and crime boss in the Vladivostok area. He is notable for writing, directing, producing and starring in a short TV series called Spets, which aimed to show viewers the reality of the Russian underworld.

==Biography==

Although Dyomochka was an A-grade student,[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] he was expelled from school and later college.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] As the Soviet era drew to a close, he started his criminal career collecting protection money from local clothing stores as capitalism started to take off.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Vitali was convicted of several crimes including extortion and shooting a rival gangster, and after his release from prison in 1997 became the head of the Podstava criminal group.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] The gang specialized in blackmailing money from passing drivers by setting up car accidents.
Dyomochka was also interviewed in the 2010 documentary Thieves by Law.

==Spets TV show==

Unsatisfied with the way organized crime was depicted in film and television,[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] Vitali set about creating his own TV series. Largely financed by his own money, the seven-part series finished production in 2003 and became a huge success, getting close to 100% ratings on a local television station.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] The series drew a lot upon Vitali's own experiences, such as when a driver he had attempted to blackmail turned out to be a judge.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Over the course of the series ten members of his gang were arrested and one was murdered by rivals.
