==History==

The English Queen's crown was likely produced about 1370 and has been associated with Queen Anne of Bohemia, the consort of King Richard II of England. The crown came to the Palatinian line of the house of Wittelsbach as dowry of Blanche of England, a daughter of King Henry IV of England. After his ascension to the English throne, King Henry IV wanted to make important alliances in order to maintain and legitimize his rule. One needed ally was the Wittelsbach King Rupert of Germany, who also took the German throne after the deposition of King Wenceslaus: a marriage between Rupert's eldest surviving son Louis and Henry IV's eldest daughter Blanche was soon arranged.  The marriage contract was signed on 7 March 1401 in London; the bride's dowry was fixed in the amount of 40,000 Nobeln.
The crown is today displayed in the treasury of the Munich Residenz, where it  has been kept since 1782.
