Loft Story was a Quebec television series broadcast on the TQS television network, and was an adaptation of the show Loft Story in France, which itself was an adaptation of the Big Brother franchise. TQS became V and replaced Loft Story with a new Big Brother series for Quebec in 2010.
During the first season (2003), the show had TVA's Occupation Double as its main competitor, and was a success in terms of viewership, but was not as financially successful as the French version.  Therefore, the program was discontinued the following season, but was resurrected three years later in January 2006. In response to criticism of year 1, year 2 toned down the sexual content and replaced it with daily games and truth/dare events.  The loft was also changed to include a "stunt room" the size of a basketball court, which serves for games and entertainment.   A third season started in September 2006, a fourth on September 26, 2007, a fifth in Fall 2008 and an All-Star season subtitled La Revanche in Spring 2009.
