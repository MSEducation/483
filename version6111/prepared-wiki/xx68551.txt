The airport has repeatedly attempted to receive service from Mexico, the latest attempt being in 2005, where the airport had reached an agreement with the Mexican regional airline Aeromar, which was supposed to fly 2-3 times a week from Corpus Christi to Monterrey, Mexico on an ATR-42 aircraft and had received Department of Transportation (DOT) approval for the route. The airline still needs DOT approval to fly into the United States, as this will be the airline's second international destination, first being San Antonio. However, in a letter to the DOT, Aeromar has stated it will not seek renewal of the permit to fly to Corpus Christi.Corpus Christi Caller-Times
The airport is frequently used by United Express and Southwest Airlines as a diversion station in case of weather problems in Houston.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]
