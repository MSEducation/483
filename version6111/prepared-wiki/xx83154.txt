The Country of Carnival (Portuguese: O Pa√≠s do Carnaval) is a Brazilian Modernist novel. It was written by Jorge Amado in 1931. In this debut novel, the themes that would come to permeate the author's work can already be seen, albeit in an embryonic form. The book is an account of the typical Brazilian intelligentsia of the 1920s.
Paulo Rigger, a Brazilian intellectual who studied in Europe, wants to participate in the political and intellectual life of the country. He criticizes the racial miscegenation of the country and particularly the institution of carnaval, which he blames for the country's lagging development. Paulo finally becomes disillusioned and returns to Europe.
