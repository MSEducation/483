==History==

On 17 January 1859 the railways arrived in Footscray when the new Williamstown line opened with trains running from Spencer Street in Melbourne to the important cargo port of Williamstown. This railway connected to the 18-month old Geelong railway at the junction near where the current Newport station lies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://railgeelong.com/lineguide.php?line=geelong|title=Rail Geelong - Geelong Line History|publisher=railgeelong.com|accessdate=2009-09-08[/tpl] The railway between Melbourne and Footscray, via the new station at North Melbourne, had been made possible with the construction of a railway bridge over the Maribyrnong River. The first station to open in Footscray opened on this line on the opening day of service; it was not, however, where the current Footscray station lies, but was situated on Napier Street.
Shortly afterwards, Footscray became a junction station when a second railway, branching at Footscray, was opened to Sunbury. By 1862 this railway had been extended to Sandhurst (later renamed Bendigo). Therefore, on 1 March 1859, less than two months after the first, Footscray's second railway station opened on Nicholson Street, not far from the other one, for services on the new railway line.Infrastructure - Footscray Vicsig A signal box was provided at the junction from 1879.
On 16 September 1900 the current station opened, located at the precise point of junction of the two lines.http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/73250527 The two original stations were closed.
A number of sidings once existed at the station, now covered by car parking on the eastern side of the Newport bound lines.
The two tracks under the station were opened on 21 October 1928 as part of the South Kensington - West Footscray line, and were dual-gauged in the early 1960s as part of the construction of the Melbourne-Albury standard gauge line. Quadruplication of the tracks towards Melbourne in November 1976 put an end to the junction and closed the signal box. The building is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.
It was upgraded to a Premium station on 31 May 1996, although the enclosed waiting area and ticket facilities were built in 1993 as part of the 'Travel Safe' program in the early 1990s.[tpl]cite journal|date=October 1997|title=Upgrading Eltham to a Premium Station|journal=Newsrail|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society|pages=page 310[/tpl]
In 2010, as a part of the Brumby State Government's Footscray renewal program,[tpl]cite web|title=Transport Projects eNews|url=http://enews.transport.vic.gov.au/link/id/zzzz4ed56ac459884508/page.html?ib=1|publisher=Department of Transport, Victoria|accessdate=2013-01-19[/tpl] the existing footbridge over the platforms, which was accessed by ramps, was replaced with a $15 million footbridge. The bridge, named after indigenous activist William Cooper,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/the-great-disconnect-20101101-17afe.html|location=Melbourne|work=The Age|first=Clay|last=Lucas|title=The great disconnect|date=2 November 2010[/tpl] has stairs and associated lifts. Complaints have been made that the new footbridge is less usable than the one it replaced. It has a roof, but that has not been designed to be weatherproof, and the lifts are prone to breakdown.[tpl]cite web|title=Colander Bridge|url=http://www.ffrr.footscray.org/documents/colander-bridge|publisher=Fair-go for Footscray Rail Residents|accessdate=2013-02-19[/tpl] In 2013 the new footbridge was partially demolished.[tpl]cite news|last=Millar|first=Benjamin|title=Footscray commuters face long wait for station works completion|url=http://www.maribyrnongweekly.com.au/story/1281208/footscray-commuters-face-long-wait-for-station-works-completion/?cs=1468|accessdate=2013-02-19|newspaper=Maribyrnong Weekly|date=2013-02-06[/tpl]
As part of the Regional Rail Link, an additional two platforms have been built to the north of the existing platforms, that will separate Metro Trains Sunbury services from V/Line services to Ballarat and Bendigo. In January 2014 platforms 1 to 4 were renumbered 3 to 6 with the new platforms commissioned as platforms 1 and 2.Major access changes V/Line January 2014 Platforms 3 and 4 were closed in January 2014 and are being rebuilt as dedicated platforms for V/Line services.
