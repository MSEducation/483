Sound of White Noise is the sixth studio album by American thrash metal band Anthrax, released in May 1993 on Elektra Records. It is the band's first album to feature vocalist John Bush, who replaced longtime Anthrax vocalist Joey Belladonna in 1992. It is also Anthrax's last studio album with longtime lead guitarist Dan Spitz.

==Overview==

The album, produced by the band and Dave Jerden, includes the singles "Only", "Black Lodge", "Room for One More" and "Hy Pro Glo". This album marked a significant revision in the band's sound, with the departure of lead vocalist Joey Belladonna and the introduction of grunge influences (Dave Jerden was the producer of Alice in Chains). Typical thrash metal elements such as speed and aggression, which characterized much of Anthrax's earlier work, are largely absent from their sound at this juncture in their career. The album debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 charts,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/sound-of-white-noise-mw0000617745/awards | title = Sound of White Noise Billboard Albums | accessdate = 2013-04-16 | work = Allmusic | publisher = Rovi Corporation[/tpl] Anthrax's highest ever chart position.

==Reception==

Dave Connolly reviewed the album on behalf of Allmusic, giving the album three stars out of five. Connolly called the album "surprising melodic" but "predictably pummeling" and the music "relentless." He commends the overall quality of the songs on the album before settling on "Only" as the best overall, but calls out several other tracks for praise as well.
Among the album's songs, "Only" has received particular attention; Metallica frontman James Hetfield is said to have referred to "Only" as a "perfect song."[tpl]cite web|last=Ramirez|first=Carlos|title=Top 10 John Bush Era Anthrax Songs|url=http://www.noisecreep.com/2009/08/28/ok-needs-photo-top-10-john-bush-era-anthrax-songs/|work=Noisecreep.com|accessdate=4 August 2012[/tpl]
