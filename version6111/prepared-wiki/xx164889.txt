==History==

The park opened to the public in 1933, after the state acquired the property.  The park's first six years saw a joint effort by the state and the National Park System that allowed for construction by the Civilian Conservation Corps of Cheaha Lake and its stone bath house, eleven stone cabins, two stone pavilions, Bunker Tower, and the Bald Rock Group Lodge.  The first phase of construction was completed in 1939.  A new hotel, restaurant, and five chalets were added in 1973, and restored and renovated in 1997.
