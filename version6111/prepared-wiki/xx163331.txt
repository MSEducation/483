Twenty Questions was a Canadian television game show, which aired on CTV in the 1961-62 television season. Produced by CJAY-TV in Winnipeg and hosted by Stewart Macpherson, the show was an adaptation of the earlier American game show Twenty Questions.
Panelists on the show included Rassy Ragland, the mother of Neil Young.
Twenty Questions was broadcast on Wednesday evenings, 19:30 in Toronto, beginning 4 October 1961. The programme lasted only a single season on CTV. Macpherson subsequently went on to host a British adaptation of Twenty Questions for Associated-Rediffusion.
Les Wedman, television columnist for The Vancouver Sun, deemed the production to be a "dull, witless presentation of a parlor sic game".[tpl]Cite news| title=TV - The Glass Eye | first=Les | last=Wedman | publisher=The Vancouver Sun | date=5 October 1963 | page=13 [/tpl]
