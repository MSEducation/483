The council is divided into:

==Camps==

The New Birth of Freedom Council owns four council camps, Hidden Valley Scout Reservation, Camp Tuckahoe, Camp Conewago, and Wizard Ranch.

===Hidden Valley Scout Reservation===

Situated on 830+ acres near Loysville, PA in Perry County, with the scenic Sherman’s Creek and it’s exciting fishing opportunities running through it, Hidden Valley has been in operation since 1927.  It is one of four camps operated by the New Birth of Freedom Council.
Hidden Valley offers five weeks of Boy Scout summer camp as well as a Trail to Eagle Camp.
For Scouting units and non-stop groups looking for year-round outdoor opportunities, Hidden Valley also offers a wide variety of comfortable cabins, with capacities ranging from 10 to 65 people.

===Camp Tuckahoe===

Camp Tuckahoe is the largest of four camps owned by the New Birth of Freedom Council, and is currently operated for use by both Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts. The [tpl]convert|1300|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] site is located in York County, Pennsylvania a few miles west of Dillsburg.
The site was formerly a hunting camp which the Council purchased on March 21, 1947 to replace Camp Ganoga. Construction on the property started in the spring of 1947, and the first camping season got underway the next year on June 27, 1948. Many of the later facilities where not present that first season, including the lake, troops cabins (the boys all slept in tents or lean-tos), and the memorial chapel.
From the purchase of the land until part way through the first season, the camp was referred to as "South Mountain Camp" and also "South Mountain Memorial Scout Camp" (as a tribute to WWII servicemen). During the initial camp season, a contest was held to choose between the names "South Mountain", "Tuckahoe", and "Whippoorwill", and Tuckahoe won out. The name Tuckahoe is attributed to mean "Land of the Deer and the Fawn" in a Native American language.
The Memorial Mall and adjoining Chapels are the centerpiece of Camp Tuckahoe. The Mall is an open area lined by hemlock trees that is often used for camp ceremonies and quiet activities. Each of the hemlock trees has been dedicated to a member of the "Council Eternal" (a Scout or Scouter who has died). Additional dedications are made annually when new names are added to the Memorial Wall. Another feature of the Mall is a reflection area where Scouts can read a bronze plaque bearing the words of Rudyard Kiplings's poem If—  The recently renovated indoor chapel at the top of the mall was dedicated in memory of Rabbi Goode, one of the Four Chaplains from the USAT Dorchester.
An area of Camp Tuckahoe called "Cub World" is segmented off for use just by Cub Scouts. It is a special place within the camp that has programs and facilities specifically designed for boys ages 6–10.http://newbirthoffreedom.org/tuckahoe/cub-world/
Themed areas include the Pirate Ship, Medieval Castle, Frontier Fort, and the Native American Village. Sleeping arrangements are available in all four areas. Other more general use areas include the Nature Tree House,a Mine, Physical Fitness trail, Cub Activity Field, and Cub Pavilion. Additionally there are Air Rifles, Action Archery (a sling shot course), and Archery Ranges, which tend to be heavily used during summer camp sessions. Sleeping arraignments are available in four large tepees in the Native American Village.
Each year, during the designated Cub Scout weeks, the activities in camp are based on a theme. During the week there are many activities centered around the theme of the year. These themes rotate between Safari (2002, 2006, 2010), Wild West (2003, 2007, 2011), Knights of the Round Table (2004, 2008, 2012), and Pirates of Camp Tuckahoe (2005, 2009, and 2013).
The other Council camps are Camp Conewago and Wizard Ranch.http://newbirthoffreedom.org/camping/

==Sasquesahanough Lodge==

Sasquesahanough Lodge was formed in 2010 from the mergers of Tuckahoe Lodge and Susquehannock Lodge. Sasquesahanough is the 1612 spelling of Susquehanna and reflects the geographic area covered by the lodge. The lodge totem is the phoenix, reflecting the new council name.
