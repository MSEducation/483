[[16-cell]]

CATEGORIES: Four-dimensional geometry, Polychora

In four-dimensional geometry, a 16-cell or hexadecachoron is a regular convex 4-polytope. It is one of the six regular convex 4-polytopes first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli in the mid-19th century. 
It is a part of an infinite family of polytopes, called cross-polytopes or orthoplexes. The dual polytope is the tesseract (4-cube). Conway's name for a cross-polytope is orthoplex, for orthant complex.

==Geometry==

It is bounded by 16 cells, all of which are regular tetrahedra. It has 32 triangular faces, 24 edges, and 8 vertices. The 24 edges bound 6 squares lying in the 6 coordinate planes.
The eight vertices of the 16-cell are (±1, 0, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0, 0), (0, 0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, 0, ±1). All vertices are connected by edges except opposite pairs.
The Schläfli symbol of the 16-cell is {3,3,4}. Its vertex figure is a regular octahedron. There are 8 tetrahedra, 12 triangles, and 6 edges meeting at every vertex. Its edge figure is a square. There are 4 tetrahedra and 4 triangles meeting at every edge.
The 16-cell can be decomposed into two similar disjoint circular chains of eight tetrahedrons each, four edges long.  Each chain, when stretched out straight, forms a Boerdijk–Coxeter helix. This decomposition can be seen in the alternated 4-4 duoprism construction, [tpl]CDD|node|4|node_h|2|node_h|4|node[/tpl], of the 16-cell, symmetry 4,2+,4, order 64.

==Tessellations==

One can tessellate 4-dimensional Euclidean space by regular 16-cells. This is called the hexadecachoric honeycomb and has Schläfli symbol {3,3,4,3}. The dual tessellation, icositetrachoric honeycomb, {3,4,3,3}, is made of by regular 24-cells. Together with the tesseractic honeycomb {4,3,3,4}, these are the only three regular tessellations of R4.  Each 16-cell has 16 neighbors with which it shares a tetrahedron, 24 neighbors with which it shares only an edge, and 72 neighbors with which it shares only a single point. Twenty-four 16-cells meet at any given vertex in this tessellation.

==Projections==

The cell-first parallel projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has a cubical envelope. The closest and farthest cells are projected to inscribed tetrahedra within the cube, corresponding with the two possible ways to inscribe a regular tetrahedron in a cube. Surrounding each of these tetrahedra are 4 other (non-regular) tetrahedral volumes that are the images of the 4 surrounding tetrahedral cells, filling up the space between the inscribed tetrahedron and the cube. The remaining 6 cells are projected onto the square faces of the cube. In this projection of the 16-cell, all its edges lie on the faces of the cubical envelope.
The cell-first perspective projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has a triakis tetrahedral envelope. The layout of the cells within this envelope are analogous to that of the cell-first parallel projection.
The vertex-first parallel projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has an octahedral envelope. This octahedron can be divided into 8 tetrahedral volumes, by cutting along the coordinate planes. Each of these volumes is the image of a pair of cells in the 16-cell. The closest vertex of the 16-cell to the viewer projects onto the center of the octahedron.
Finally the edge-first parallel projection has a shortened octahedral envelope, and the face-first parallel projection has a hexagonal bipyramidal envelope.

==4 sphere Venn Diagram==

The usual projection of the 16-cell 80px and 4 intersecting spheres (a Venn diagram of 4 sets) form topologically the same object in 3D-space:

==Symmetry constructions==

There is a lower symmetry form of the 16-cell, called a demitesseract or 4-demicube, a member of the demihypercube family, and represented by h{4,3,3}, and Coxeter diagrams [tpl]CDD|node_h1|4|node|3|node|3|node[/tpl] or [tpl]CDD|nodes_10ru|split2|node|3|node[/tpl]. It can be drawn bicolored with alternating tetrahedral cells.
It can also be seen in lower symmetry form as a tetrahedral antiprism, constructed by 2 parallel tetrahedra in dual configurations, connected by 8 (possibly elongated) tetrahedra. It is represented by s{2,4,3}, and Coxeter diagram: [tpl]CDD|node_h|2|node_h|4|node|3|node[/tpl].
It can also be seen as a snub 4-orthotope, represented by s{21,1,1}, and Coxeter diagram: [tpl]CDD|node_h|2|node_h|2|node_h|2|node_h[/tpl].
With the tesseract constructed as a 4-4 duoprism, the 16-cell can be seen as its dual, a 4-4 duopyramid.

==Related uniform polytopes and honeycombs==

The 16-cell is a part of the tesseractic family of uniform polychora:
This polychoron is also related to the cubic honeycomb, order-4 dodecahedral honeycomb, and order-4 hexagonal tiling honeycomb all which have octahedral vertex figures.
It is similar to three regular polychora: the 5-cell {3,3,3}, 600-cell {3,3,5} of Euclidean 4-space, and the order-6 tetrahedral honeycomb {3,3,6} of hyperbolic space. All of these have a tetrahedral cells.
