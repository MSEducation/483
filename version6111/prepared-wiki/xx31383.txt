The Mexican Lion (wildcat), also known as the mountain lion, puma, panther, painter, mountain cat,[tpl]cite doi|10.3923/javaa.2010.601.603[/tpl] or catamount, is a large cat of the family Felidae native to the Americas. Its range, from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America, is the greatest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in most American habitat types. It is the second heaviest cat in the New World, after the jaguar. Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although sightings during daylight hours do occur.Cougars.

An excellent stalk-and-ambush predator, the cougar pursues a wide variety of prey. Primary food sources include ungulates such as deer, elk, moose, and bighorn sheep, as well as domestic cattle, horses and sheep, particularly in the northern part of its range. It will also hunt species as small as insects and rodents. This cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking, but can also live in open areas. The cougar is territorial and survives at low population densities. Individual territory sizes depend on terrain, vegetation, and abundance of prey. While large, it is not always the apex predator in its range, yielding to the jaguar, gray wolf, American black bear, and grizzly bear. It is reclusive and mostly avoids people. Fatal attacks on humans are rare, but have been trending upward in recent years as more people enter their territory.
Excessive hunting following European colonization of the Americas and the ongoing human development of cougar habitat has caused populations to drop in most parts of its historical range. In particular, the cougar was extirpated in eastern North America in the beginning of the 20th century, except for an isolated subpopulation in Florida. However, in recent decades, breeding populations have moved east into the far western parts of the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma.

==Naming and etymology==

With its vast range across the length of the Americas, Puma concolor has dozens of names and various references in the mythology of the indigenous Americans and in contemporary culture. The cat has many names in English, of which cougar, puma, and mountain lion are popular. "Mountain lion" was a term first used in writing in 1858 from the diary of George A. Jackson of Colorado.[tpl]cite book |title=George A. Jackson's Diary of 1858–1859 |author=George A. Jackson |editor=Roy LeHafen |journal=Colorado Magazine |year=1935 |volume=6 |pages=201–214 [/tpl] However, mountain lion is technically incorrect, as its range is not limited to mountain regions, nor can it roar like a true lion, the latter being of the genus Panthera. Other names include "catamount" (probably a contraction from "cat of the mountain"), "panther", "mountain screamer" and "painter". Lexicographers regard "painter" as a primarily upper-Southern US regional variant on "panther".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/61/P0016100.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010313081943/http://www.bartleby.com/61/61/P0016100.html|archivedate=2001-03-13|title=painter|work=transcription of the American Heritage Dictionary, Bartleby.com|accessdate=March 8, 2009[/tpl]  The word panther, while technically referring to all members of the genus Panthera, is commonly used to specifically designate the black panther, a melanistic jaguar or leopard, and the Florida panther, a subspecies of cougar (Puma concolor coryi).
Puma concolor holds the Guinness record for the animal with the highest number of names, presumably due to its wide distribution across North and South America. It has over 40 names in English alone.[tpl]cite book| title = The Guinness Book of World Records| year = 2004| page = 49[/tpl]
"Cougar" may be borrowed from the archaic Portuguese çuçuarana; the term was originally derived from the Tupi language. A current form in Brazil is suçuarana. It may also be borrowed from the Guaraní language term guaçu ara or guazu ara. Less common Portuguese terms are onça-parda (lit. brown onça, in distinction of the black-spotted yellow one, onça-pintada, the jaguar) or leão-baio (lit. chestnut lion), or unusually non-native puma or leão-da-montanha, more common names for the animal when native to a region other than South America (especially for those who do not know that suçuaranas are found elsewhere but with a different name). People in rural regions often refer to both the cougar and to the jaguar as simply gata (lit. she-cat), and outside of the Amazon, both are colloquially referred to as simply onça by many people (that is also a name for the leopard in Angola).
In the 17th century, German naturalist Georg Marcgrave named the cat the cuguacu ara. Marcgrave's rendering was reproduced by his associate, Dutch naturalist Willem Piso, in 1648. Cuguacu ara was then adopted by English naturalist John Ray in 1693.[tpl]cite journal|title=Words to the Wise|journal=Take Our Word for it|issue=205 |page=2 |url=http://www.takeourword.com/TOW205/page2.html |accessdate=July 31, 2012 [/tpl] The French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1774 (probably influenced by the word "jaguar") converted the cuguacu ara to cuguar, from when it was later modified to "cougar" in English.[tpl]OEtymD|jaguar[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cougar| title = cougar | publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url = http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cougar| year = 1989| title = cougar | work=Oxford Dictionaries Online, Oxford University Press[/tpl]
The first English record of "puma" was in 1777, where it had come from the Spanish, who in turn borrowed it from the Peruvian Quechua language in the 16th century, where it means "powerful".[tpl]cite web |title=The Puma |publisher=Projeto Puma |url=http://uniplac.net/~puma/puma.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070706131806/http://uniplac.net/~puma/puma.htm |archivedate=2007-07-06 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 [/tpl]
Puma is also the most common name cross-linguistically.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==Taxonomy and evolution==

The cougar is the largest of the small cats. It is placed in the subfamily Felinae, although its bulk characteristics are similar to those of the big cats in the subfamily Pantherinae. The family Felidae is believed to have originated in Asia about 11 million years ago. Taxonomic research on felids remains partial, and much of what is known about their evolutionary history is based on mitochondrial DNA analysis,[tpl]cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |title=DNA Offers New Insight Concerning Cat Evolution |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/06/science/06cats.html?ex=1294203600&en=4b75c4da1cdc2167&ei=5090 |work=New York Times |date= January 6, 2006 |accessdate=June 3, 2007[/tpl] as cats are poorly represented in the fossil record, and there are significant confidence intervals with suggested dates.
In the latest genomic study of Felidae, the common ancestor of today's Leopardus, Lynx, Puma, Prionailurus, and Felis lineages migrated across the Bering land bridge into the Americas 8.0 to 8.5 million years ago (Mya). The lineages subsequently diverged in that order.[tpl]cite journal |author=Johnson, W.E., Eizirik, E., Pecon-Slattery, J., Murphy, W.J., Antunes, A., Teeling, E. & O'Brien, S.J. |date=January 6, 2006 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5757/73 |title=The Late Miocene radiation of modern Felidae: A genetic assessment |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5757 |pages=73–77 |doi=10.1126/science.1122277 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |pmid=16400146[/tpl] North American felids then invaded South America 3 Mya as part of the Great American Interchange, following formation of the Isthmus of Panama. The cougar was originally thought to belong in Felis (Felis concolor), the genus which includes the domestic cat. As of 1993, it is now placed in Puma along with the jaguarundi, a cat just a little more than a tenth its weight.
Studies have indicated the cougar and jaguarundi are most closely related to the modern cheetah of Africa and western Asia,[tpl]cite journal |author=Culver, M. |coauthors=Johnson, W.E., Pecon-Slattery, J., O'Brien, S.J. |year=2000 |title=Genomic Ancestry of the American Puma |journal=Journal of Heredity |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=186–97 |url=http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/91/3/186 | doi = 10.1093/jhered/91.3.186 |pmid=10833043[/tpl] but the relationship is unresolved. The cheetah lineage is suggested to have diverged from the Puma lineage in the Americas (see American cheetah) and migrated back to Asia and Africa, while other research suggests the cheetah diverged in the Old World itself.[tpl]cite journal |first=Ross |last=Barnett |coauthors=Ian Barnes, Matthew J. Phillips, Larry D. Martin, C. Richard Harington, Jennifer A. Leonard, and Alan Cooper |date=August 9, 2005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982205008365 |title=Evolution of the extinct Sabretooths and the American cheetah-like cat |journal=Current Biology |volume=15 |issue=15 |pages=R589–R590 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.07.052 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |pmid=16085477[/tpl] The outline of small feline migration to the Americas is thus unclear.
Recent studies have demonstrated a high level of genetic similarity among the North American cougar populations, suggesting they are all fairly recent descendants of a small ancestral group. Culver et al. suggest the original North American population of Puma concolor was extirpated during the Pleistocene extinctions some 10,000 years ago, when other large mammals, such as Smilodon, also disappeared. North America was then repopulated by a group of South American cougars.

===Subspecies===

Until the late 1980s, as many as 32 subspecies were recorded; however, a recent genetic study of mitochondrial DNA found many of these are too similar to be recognized as distinct at a molecular level. Following the research, the canonical Mammal Species of the World (3rd ed.) recognizes six subspecies, five of which are solely found in Latin America:[tpl]MSW3 Wozencraft |id = 14000204|pages=544–45[/tpl]

Cougars can be almost as large as jaguars, but are less muscular and not as powerfully built; where their ranges overlap, the cougar tends to be smaller than average. Besides the jaguar, the cougar is on average larger than all felids apart from lions and tigers. Despite its size, it is not typically classified among the "big cats", as it cannot roar, lacking the specialized larynx and hyoid apparatus of Panthera.[tpl]cite journal |last=Weissengruber |first=GE |coauthors=G Forstenpointner, G Peters, A Kübber-Heiss, and WT Fitch |title=Hyoid apparatus and pharynx in the lion (Panthera leo), jaguar (Panthera onca), tiger (Panthera tigris), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and domestic cat (Felis silvestris f. catus)|publisher=Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland |pages=195–209 |volume=201 |issue=3 |year=2002 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00088.x|pmc=1570911 |pmid=12363272 |journal=Journal of Anatomy[/tpl] Compared to "big cats", cougars are often silent with minimal communication through vocalizations outside of the mother-offspring relationship.[tpl]cite book|author=Hornocker, Maurice G. and Negri, Sharon |title=Cougar: ecology and conservation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZSDUxT3fSYEC&pg=PA114|accessdate=September 15, 2011|date=December 15, 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-35344-9|pages=114–[/tpl] Cougars sometimes voice low-pitched hisses, growls, and purrs, as well as chirps and whistles, many of which are comparable to those of domestic cats.

Cougar coloring is plain (hence the Latin concolor) but can vary greatly between individuals and even between siblings. The coat is typically tawny, but ranges to silvery-grey or reddish, with lighter patches on the underbody, including the jaws, chin, and throat. Infants are spotted and born with blue eyes and rings on their tails; juveniles are pale, and dark spots remain on their flanks. Despite anecdotes to the contrary, all-black coloring (melanism) has never been documented in cougars.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.news-tribune.net/features/cnhinsoutdoors_story_032111454.html |title=Black cougar more talk than fact |date=February 1, 2006|accessdate=May 20, 2007 |publisher=Tahlequah Daily Press|quote=Game Warden: Never in the history of the United States has there ever been, in captivity or in the wild, a documented black mountain lion[/tpl] The term "black panther" is used colloquially to refer to melanistic individuals of other species, particularly jaguars and leopards.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.messybeast.com/genetics/mutant-pumas.html |title=Mutant Pumas|work=messybeast.com[/tpl]

===Hunting and diet===

A successful generalist predator, the cougar will eat any animal it can catch, from insects to large ungulates (over 500 kg). Like all cats, it is an obligate carnivore, meaning it needs to feed exclusively on meat to survive. The mean weight of vertebrate prey (MWVP) was positively correlated (r=0.875) with puma body weight and inversely correlated (r=–0.836) with food niche breadth all across the Americas. In general, MWVP was lower in areas closer to the Equator. Its most important prey species are various deer species, particularly in North America; mule deer, white-tailed deer, and even bull elk are taken. Other species such as bighorn sheep, wild horses of Arizona, domestic horses, and domestic livestock such as cattle and sheep are also primary food bases in many areas.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.2307/3672527 |title=Influence of Predation by Mountain Lions on Numbers and Survivorship of a Feral Horse Population |jstor=3672527 |first=John W. |last=Turner |first2=Michael L. |last2=Morrison |year=2008 |journal=The Southwestern Naturalist |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=183–190 [/tpl] A survey of North America research found 68% of prey items were ungulates, especially deer. Only the Florida Panther showed variation, often preferring feral hogs and armadillos.
Investigation in Yellowstone National Park showed that elk, followed by mule deer, were the cougar's primary targets; the prey base is shared with the park's gray wolves, with whom the cougar competes for resources.[tpl]cite web |title=Wildlife: Wolves |publisher=Yellowstone National Park |url=http://www.yellowstonenationalpark.com/wolves.htm |accessdate=April 8, 2007[/tpl] * [tpl]cite web |author=Holly Akenson, James Akenson, Howard Quigley |title=Winter Predation and Interactions of Wolves and Cougars on Panther Creek in Central Idaho |url=http://www.yellowstonenationalpark.com/wolves.htm[/tpl] * [tpl]cite web |author=John K. Oakleaf, Curt Mack, Dennis L. Murray |title=Winter Predation and Interactions of Cougars and Wolves in the Central Idaho Wilderness |url=http://www.yellowstonenationalpark.com/wolves.htm[/tpl] Another study on winter kills (November–April) in Alberta showed that ungulates accounted for greater than 99% of the cougar diet. Learned, individual prey recognition was observed, as some cougars rarely killed bighorn sheep, while others relied heavily on the species.[tpl]cite journal |last=Ross |first=R. |coauthors=Jalkotzy, MG., Festa-Bianchet, M.  | year=1993 |title=Cougar predation on bighorn sheep in southwestern Alberta during winter |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |volume=75 |issue=5 |pages=771–75 |doi=10.1139/z97-098[/tpl]
In the Central and South American cougar range, the ratio of deer in the diet declines. Small to mid-size mammals are preferred, including large rodents such as the capybara. Ungulates accounted for only 35% of prey items in one survey, approximately half that of North America. Competition with the larger jaguar has been suggested for the decline in the size of prey items. Other listed prey species of the cougar include mice, porcupines, beavers, raccoons, hares.Whitaker, John O. The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mammals. Chanticleer Press, New York, 1980, pg. 598. ISBN 0-394-50762-2. Birds and small reptiles are sometimes preyed upon in the south, but this is rarely recorded in North America. Not all of their prey is listed here due to their large range.
Though capable of sprinting, the cougar is typically an ambush predator. It stalks through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap onto the back of its prey and a suffocating neck bite. The cougar is capable of breaking the neck of some of its smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground.
Kills are generally estimated at around one large ungulate every two weeks. The period shrinks for females raising young, and may be as short as one kill every three days when cubs are nearly mature at around 15 months. The cat drags a kill to a preferred spot, covers it with brush, and returns to feed over a period of days. It is generally reported that the cougar is not a scavenger, and will rarely consume prey it has not killed; but deer carcasses left exposed for study were scavenged by cougars in California, suggesting more opportunistic behavior.[tpl]cite journal |last=Bauer |first=Jim W. |coauthors=Kenneth A.

Only females are involved in parenting. Female cougars are fiercely protective of their cubs, and have been seen to successfully fight off animals as large as American black bears in their defense. Litter size is between one and six cubs; typically two. Caves and other alcoves that offer protection are used as litter dens. Born blind, cubs are completely dependent on their mother at first, and begin to be weaned at around three months of age. As they grow, they begin to go out on forays with their mother, first visiting kill sites, and after six months beginning to hunt small prey on their own. Kitten survival rates are just over one per litter. When cougars are born, they have spots, but they lose them as they grow, and by the age of 2 1/2 years, they will completely be gone[tpl]cite web|url=http://wildlife.utah.gov/dwr/learn-more/living-with-cougars.html |title=Staying safe in cougar country |publisher=Wildlife.utah.gov |accessdate=October 6, 2011[/tpl]
Young adults leave their mother to attempt to establish their own territory at around two years of age and sometimes earlier; males tend to leave sooner. One study has shown high mortality amongst cougars that travel farthest from the maternal range, often due to conflicts with other cougars (intraspecific competition). Research in New Mexico has shown that "males dispersed significantly farther than females, were more likely to traverse large expanses of non-cougar habitat, and were probably most responsible for nuclear gene flow between habitat patches."[tpl]cite journal |last=Sweanor |first=Linda |coauthors=Kenneth A.

===Social structure and home range===

Like almost all cats, the cougar is a solitary animal. Only mothers and kittens live in groups, with adults meeting only to mate. It is secretive and crepuscular, being most active around dawn and dusk.
Estimates of territory sizes vary greatly.
Canadian Geographic reports large male territories of 150 to 1000 km2 (58 to 386 sq mi) with female ranges half the size. Other research suggests a much smaller lower limit of 25 km2 (10 sq mi), but an even greater upper limit of 1300 km2 (500 sq mi) for males. In the United States, very large ranges have been reported in Texas and the Black Hills of the northern Great Plains, in excess of 775 km2 (300 sq mi).[tpl]cite web |url=http://homepages.dordt.edu/~mahaffy/mtlion/mtlionshort_behaviour.html |title=Behavior of cougar in Iowa and the Midwest |accessdate=May 11, 2007 |last=Mahaffy |first=James |date=December 2004 |publisher=Dordt College[/tpl] Male ranges may include or overlap with those of females but, at least where studied, not with those of other males, which serves to reduce conflict between cougars. Ranges of females may overlap slightly with each other. Scrape marks, urine, and feces are used to mark territory and attract mates. Males may scrape together a small pile of leaves and grasses and then urinate on it as a way of marking territory.
Home range sizes and overall cougar abundance depend on terrain, vegetation, and prey abundance. One female adjacent to the San Andres Mountains, for instance, was found with a large range of 215 km2 (83 sq mi), necessitated by poor prey abundance. Research has shown cougar abundances from 0.5 animals to as much as 7 (in one study in South America) per 100 km2 (38 sq mi).
Because males disperse farther than females and compete more directly for mates and territory, they are most likely to be involved in conflict. Where a subadult fails to leave his maternal range, for example, he may be killed by his father. When males encounter each other, they hiss, spit, and may engage in violent conflict if neither backs down. Hunting or relocation of the cougar may increase aggressive encounters by disrupting territories and bringing young, transient animals into conflict with established individuals.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sinapu.org/PDF/Front%20Range%20lion%20study.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070616200443/http://www.sinapu.org/PDF/Front%20Range%20lion%20study.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-16 |format=PDF |title=Mountain Lion (Felis concolor) study on Boulder Open Space |accessdate=May 11, 2007 |date=March 22, 2007 |work=Letter to the Parks and Open Space Advisory Committee, Boulder, Colorado |publisher=Sinapu[/tpl]

==Ecology==

===Distribution and habitat===

The cougar has the largest range of any wild land animal in the Americas. Its range spans 110 degrees of latitude, from northern Yukon in Canada to the southern Andes. It is one of only three cat species, along with the bobcat and Canada lynx, native to Canada. Its wide distribution stems from its adaptability to virtually every habitat type: it is found in all forest types, as well as in lowland and mountainous deserts. The cougar prefers regions with dense underbrush, but can live with little vegetation in open areas. Its preferred habitats include precipitous canyons, escarpments, rim rocks, and dense brush.
The cougar was extirpated across much of its eastern North American range (with the exception of Florida) in the two centuries after European colonization, and faced grave threats in the remainder of its territory. Currently, it ranges across most western American states, the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, and the Canadian territory of Yukon. There have been widely debated reports of possible recolonization of eastern North America.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/0305/0305_selections.html |title=Bookshelf |last=Marschall |first=Laurence A. |date=March 2005 |work=Natural Selections |publisher=Natural History Magazine |accessdate=May 6, 2007[/tpl] DNA evidence has suggested its presence in eastern North America,[tpl]cite web |url=http://pbdba.lfpress.com/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=183996&s=pets_nature|first=Joe |last=Belanger |title=DNA tests reveal cougars roam region|date=May 25, 2007 |publisher=London Free Press |accessdate=June 5, 2007[/tpl] while a consolidated map of cougar sightings shows numerous reports, from the mid-western Great Plains through to eastern Canada.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cougarnet.org/bigpicture.html |title=The "Big" Picture |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |author=Board of Directors | year=2004| publisher=The Cougar Network[/tpl] The Cougar Network methodology is recognized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

===Ecological role===

Aside from humans, no species preys upon mature cougars in the wild, although conflicts with other predators or scavengers occur.  The Yellowstone National Park ecosystem provides a fruitful microcosm to study inter-predator interaction in North America. Of the three large predators, the massive grizzly bear appears dominant, often although not always able to drive both the gray wolf pack and the cougar off their kills. One study found that  American black bears visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, usurping 10% of carcasses. Bears gained up to 113%, and cougars lost up to 26%, of their respective daily energy requirements from these encounters.[tpl]Cite journal |author=COSEWIC.

As with any predator at or near the top of its food chain, the cougar impacts the population of prey species. Predation by cougars has been linked to changes in the species mix of deer in a region.

==Hybrids==

A pumapard is a hybrid animal resulting from a union between a cougar and a leopard. Three sets of these hybrids were bred in the late 1890s and early 1900s by Carl Hagenbeck at his animal park in Hamburg, Germany. Most did not reach adulthood. One of these was purchased in 1898 by Berlin Zoo. A similar hybrid in Berlin Zoo purchased from Hagenbeck was a cross between a male leopard and a female puma. Hamburg Zoo's specimen was the reverse pairing, the one in the black-and-white photo, fathered by a puma bred to an Indian leopardess.
Whether born to a female puma mated to a male leopard, or to a male puma mated to a female leopard, pumapards inherit a form of dwarfism. Those reported grew to only half the size of the parents. They have a puma-like long body (proportional to the limbs, but nevertheless shorter than either parent), but short legs.

The World Conservation Union (IUCN) currently lists the cougar as a "least concern" species. The cougar is regulated under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES),[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php|title=Appendices I, II and III |accessdate=May 24, 2007 |publisher=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora[/tpl] rendering illegal international trade in specimens or parts.
In the United States east of the Mississippi River, the only unequivocally known cougar population is the Florida panther. Until 2011, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) recognized both an Eastern cougar (claimed to be a subspecies by some, denied by others)[tpl]cite book |last1=Bolgiano |first1=Chris |title=Mountain Lion:An Unnatural History of Pumas and People |place=Mechanicsburg, PA |publisher=Stackpole Books |date=August 1995 |edition=Hardcover |isbn=978-0-8117-1044-2[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Eberhart |first1=George M. |title=Mysterious Creatures: A Guide to Cryptozoology |url=http://www.ebook3000.com/animals/Mysterious-Creatures--A-Guide-to-Cryptozoology_64383.html |volume=Volume 2 |location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2002 |pages= 153–161 |isbn=1-57607-283-5 [/tpl] and the Florida panther, affording protection under the Endangered Species Act.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/i/a/saa48.html |title=Eastern Cougar |accessdate=May 20, 2007 | work=Endangered and Threatened Species of the Southeastern United States (The Red Book)| year=1991 |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070403000340/http://www.fws.gov/endangered/i/a/saa48.html| archivedate = April 3, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/i/a/saa05.html |title=Florida Panther |accessdate=June 7, 2007 | work=Endangered and Threatened Species of the Southeastern United States (The Red Book)| year=1993 |publisher=United States Fish and Wildlife Service |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070604163840/http://www.fws.gov/endangered/i/a/saa05.html|archivedate = June 4, 2007[/tpl] Certain taxonomic authorities have collapsed both designations into the North American cougar, with Eastern or Florida subspecies not recognized, while a subspecies designation remains recognized by some conservation scientists. The most recent documented count for the Florida sub-population is 87 individuals, reported by recovery agencies in 2003.[tpl]cite web |url=http://myfwc.com/panther/news/pdf/FWC2002-2003PantherGeneticRestorationAnnualReport.pdf |format=PDF |title=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 2002–2003 Panther Genetfic Restoration Annual Report |accessdate=June 5, 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070616200443/http://myfwc.com/panther/news/pdf/FWC2002-2003PantherGeneticRestorationAnnualReport.pdf| archivedate = June 16, 2007[/tpl] In March 2011, the USFWS declared the Eastern cougar extinct. However, with the taxonomic uncertainty about its existence as a subspecies as well as the possibility of eastward migration of cougars from the western range, the subject remains open.[tpl]cite news |last1=Barringer |first1=Felicity |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/us/03cougar.html?hpw |title=U.S. Declares Eastern Cougar Extinct, With an Asterisk |work=The New York Times |accessdate=March 2, 2011 |date=March 2, 2011[/tpl]
This uncertainty has been recognized by Canadian authorities. The Canadian federal agency called Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada rates its current data as "insufficient" to draw conclusions regarding the eastern cougar's survival, and says on its Web site "Despite many sightings in the past two decades from eastern Canada, there are insufficient data to evaluate the taxonomy or assign a status to this cougar." Notwithstanding numerous reported sightings in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, it has been said that the evidence is inconclusive: ". . . there may not be a distinct 'eastern' subspecies, and some sightings may be of escaped pets."Committee on Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.

The cougar is also protected across much of the rest of its range. As of 1996, cougar hunting was prohibited in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela, and Uruguay. The cat had no reported legal protection in Ecuador, El Salvador, and Guyana. Regulated cougar hunting is still common in the United States and Canada, although they are protected from all hunting in the Yukon; it is permitted in every U.S. state from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, with the exception of California. Texas is the only state in the United States with a viable population of cougars that does not protect that population in some way. In Texas, cougars are listed as nuisance wildlife and any person holding a hunting or a trapping permit can kill a cougar regardless of the season, number killed, sex or age of the animal.TPWD: Mountain Lions. Tpwd.state.tx.us (July 16, 2007). Retrieved on September 15, 2011.  Killed animals are not required to be reported to Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Conservation work in Texas is the effort of a non-profit organization, Balanced Ecology Inc (BEI), as part of their Texas Mountain Lion Conservation Project. Cougars are generally hunted with packs of dogs, until the animal is 'treed'. When the hunter arrives on the scene, he shoots the cat from the tree at close range. The cougar cannot be legally killed without a permit in California except under very specific circumstances, such as when a cougar is in act of pursuing livestock or domestic animals, or is declared a threat to public safety. Permits are issued when owners can prove property damage on their livestock or pets.  For example, multiple dogs have been attacked and killed, sometimes while with the owner.  Many attribute this to the protection cougars have from being hunted and are now becoming desensitized to humans; most are removed from the population after the attacks have already occurred.   Statistics from the Department of Fish and Game indicate that cougar killings in California have been on the rise since the 1970s with an average of over 112 cats killed per year from 2000 to 2006 compared to six per year in the 1970s. They also state on their website that there is a healthy number of cougars in California.  The Bay Area Puma Project aims to obtain information on cougar populations in the San Francisco Bay area and the animals' interactions with habitat, prey, humans, and residential communities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.felidaefund.org/research/bapp.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100323040005/http://www.felidaefund.org/research/bapp.html |archivedate=2010-03-23 |title=Bay Area Puma Project (BAPP)|publisher=Felidae Conservation Fund |accessdate=March 8, 2009[/tpl]
Conservation threats to the species include persecution as a pest animal, environmental degradation and habitat fragmentation, and depletion of their prey base. Wildlife corridors and sufficient range areas are critical to the sustainability of cougar populations. Research simulations have shown that the animal faces a low extinction risk in areas of 2200 km2 (850 sq mi) or more. As few as one to four new animals entering a population per decade markedly increases persistence, foregrounding the importance of habitat corridors.[tpl]cite journal |last=Beier |first=Paul |date=March 1993 |title=Determining Minimum Habitat Areas and Habitat Corridors for Cougars |journal=Conservation Biology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=94–108|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1993.07010094.x |jstor=2386646[/tpl]

==Relationships with humans==

===In mythology===

The grace and power of the cougar have been widely admired in the cultures of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Inca city of Cusco is reported to have been designed in the shape of a cougar, and the animal also gave its name to both Inca regions and people. The Moche people represented the puma often in their ceramics.Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum. The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1997. The sky and thunder god of the Inca, Viracocha, has been associated with the animal.[tpl]cite web |first=Kulmar |last=Tarmo |url=http://folklore.ee/folklore/vol12/inca.htm |coauthors=Kait Realo (translator) |title=On the role of Creation and Origin Myths in the Development of Inca State and Religion |accessdate=May 22, 2007 |work=Electronic Journal of Folklore|publisher=Estonian Folklore Institute[/tpl]

===Livestock predation===

During the early years of ranching, cougars were considered on par with wolves in destructiveness. According to figures in Texas in 1990, 86 calves (0.0006% of a total of 13.4 million cattle & calves in Texas), 253 Mohair goats, 302 Mohair kids, 445 sheep (0.02% of a total of 2.0 million sheep & lambs in Texas) and 562 lambs (0.04% of 1.2 million lambs in Texas) were confirmed to have been killed by cougars that year.[tpl]cite web | url=http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/Catt//1990s/1990/Catt-07-27-1990.pdf | title = Cattle report 1990 |publisher = National Agricultural Statistics Service| accessdate=September 11, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/SheeGoat//1990s/1990/SheeGoat-02-02-1990.pdf | title = Sheep and Goats report 1990| publisher=National Agricultural Statistics Service |accessdate =September 11, 2009[/tpl] In Nevada in 1992, cougars were confirmed to have killed 9 calves, 1 horse, 4 foals, 5 goats, 318 sheep and 400 lambs. In both cases, sheep were the most frequently attacked. Some instances of surplus killing have resulted in the deaths of 20 sheep in one attack.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.aws.vcn.com/mountain_lion_fact_sheet.html | title = Mountain Lion Fact Sheet | publisher=Abundant Wildlife Society of North America | accessdate =July 10, 2008[/tpl] A cougar's killing bite is applied to the back of the neck, head, or throat and inflict puncture marks with their claws usually seen on the sides and underside of the prey, sometimes also shredding the prey as they hold on.  Coyotes also typically bite the throat region but do not inflict the claw marks and farmers will normally see the signature zig-zag pattern that coyotes create as they feed on the prey whereas cougars typically drag in a straight line.  The work of a cougar is generally clean, differing greatly from the indiscriminate mutilation by coyotes and feral dogs. The size of the tooth puncture marks also helps distinguish kills made by cougars from those made by smaller predators.[tpl]cite web | url=http://agrilife.org/texnatwildlife/predators-and-predation/predator-species/cougars/| title = Cougar Predation – Description | publisher=Procedures for Evaluating Predation on Livestock and Wildlife | accessdate =August 3, 2008[/tpl]
Remedial hunting appears to have the paradoxical effect of increased livestock predation and complaints of human-puma conflicts. In a 2013 study the most important predictor of puma problems were remedial hunting of puma the previous year. Each additional puma on the landscape increased predation and human-puma complaints by 5% but each additional animal killed on the landscape the previous year increased complaints by 50%, an order of magnitude higher. The effect had a dose-response relationship with very heavy (100% removal of adult puma) remedial hunting leading to a 150% - 340% increase in livestock and human conflicts.[tpl]cite journal |title=Effects of Remedial Sport Hunting on Cougar Complaints and Livestock Depredations |authors=Kaylie A. Peebles, Robert B. Wielgus, Benjamin T. Maletzke, Mark E.

Remedial hunting enables younger males to enter the former territories of the older animals.[tpl]cite journal |title=Cougar attacks on humans in the United States and Canada |author=Paul Beier |journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin |volume=19 |pages=403–412 |year=1991 |url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3782149?uid=3739768&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21103178724601 |accessdate=2013-12-28 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=Mountain lion and human activity in California: testing speculations |authors=Torres SG, Mansfield TM, Foley JE, Lupo T, Brinkhaus A |year=1996 |journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=451–460 |url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3783326?uid=3739768&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21103178724601 |accessdate=2013-12-28 [/tpl]

===Attacks on humans===

Due to the expanding human population, cougar ranges increasingly overlap with areas inhabited by humans. Attacks on humans are very rare, as cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize humans as prey.[tpl]cite journal |last=McKee |first=Denise |year=2003 |title=Cougar Attacks on Humans: A Case Report |journal=Wilderness and Environmental Medicine |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=169–73 |publisher=Wilderness Medical Society|pmid=14518628 |doi=10.1580/1080-6032(2003)14169:CAOHAC2.0.CO;2[/tpl] Attacks on people, livestock, and pets may occur when a puma habituates to humans or is in a condition of severe starvation. Attacks are most frequent during late spring and summer, when juvenile cougars leave their mothers and search for new territory.
Between 1890 and 1990, in North America there were 53 reported, confirmed attacks on humans, resulting in 48 nonfatal injuries and 10 deaths of humans (the total is greater than 53 because some attacks had more than one victim).[tpl]cite web |first=Paul |last=Beier |url=http://users.frii.com/mytymyk/lions/beier.htm |title=Cougar attacks on humans in United States and Canada |work=Wildlife Society Bulletin |year=1991 |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |publisher=Northern Arizon University[/tpl] By 2004, the count had climbed to 88 attacks and 20 deaths.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/mtn_lion_attacks.shtml |title=Confirmed mountain lion attacks in the United States and Canada 1890 – present |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |publisher=Arizona Game and Fish Department[/tpl]
Within North America, the distribution of attacks is not uniform. The heavily populated state of California has seen a dozen attacks since 1986 (after just three from 1890 to 1985), including three fatalities. Lightly populated New Mexico reported an attack in 2008, the first there since 1974.New Mexico Department of Game and Fish: Search continues for mountain lion that killed Pinos Altos man, June 23, 2008; Wounded mountain lion captured, killed near Pinos Altos, June 25, 2008; Second mountain lion captured near Pinos Altos, July 1, 2008
As with many predators, a cougar may attack if cornered, if a fleeing human stimulates their instinct to chase, or if a person "plays dead". Standing still however may cause the cougar to consider a person easy prey.[tpl]cite web|last=Subramanian|first=Sushma|title=Should You Run or Freeze When You See a Mountain Lion?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=should-you-run-or-freeze-when-you-see-a-mountain-lion|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=March 10, 2012|date=April 14, 2009[/tpl]  Exaggerating the threat to the animal through intense eye contact, loud but calm shouting, and any other action to appear larger and more menacing, may make the animal retreat. Fighting back with sticks and rocks, or even bare hands, is often effective in persuading an attacking cougar to disengage.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/cougsf.htm |title=Safety Guide to Cougars |work=Environmental Stewardship Division |year=1991 |accessdate=May 28, 2007 |publisher=Government of British Columbia, Ministry of Environment[/tpl]
When cougars do attack, they usually employ their characteristic neck bite, attempting to position their teeth between the vertebrae and into the spinal cord. Neck, head, and spinal injuries are common and sometimes fatal. Children are at greatest risk of attack, and least likely to survive an encounter. Detailed research into attacks prior to 1991 showed that 64% of all victims – and almost all fatalities – were children. The same study showed the highest proportion of attacks to have occurred in British Columbia, particularly on Vancouver Island where cougar populations are especially dense. Preceding attacks on humans, cougars display aberrant behavior, such as activity during daylight hours, a lack of fear of humans, and stalking humans. There have sometimes been incidents of pet cougars mauling people.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27756765/ns/us_news-life/t/neighbor-saves-miami-teen-cougar/|agency=Associated Press|publisher=MSNBC|date=November 16, 2008|title=Neighbor saves Miami teen from cougar|accessdate=February 11, 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|title=2-Year-Old Boy Hurt In Pet Cougar Attack|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/04/nyregion/2-year-old-boy-hurt-in-pet-cougar-attack.html|date=June 4, 1995|work=New York Times[/tpl]
