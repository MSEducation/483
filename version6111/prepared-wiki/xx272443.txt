==Monk==

Hoberman, along with Andy Breckman, was the co-creator of the American comedy-drama detective mystery television series, Monk, and the protagonist of the series, Adrian Monk.
Monk was originally envisioned as a "more goofy and physical" Inspector Clouseau type of character.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/28/1075088060920.html|publisher=The Age|author=Neumaier, Joe|title=Monk Comes Clean|date=January 24, 2008|accessdate=January 20, 2009[/tpl] However, Hoberman came up with the idea of a detective with obsessive-compulsive disorder.Erdmann & Block, p.2 This was inspired by his own bout with self-diagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder; in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette interview, he stated that, "Like Monk, I couldn't walk on cracks and had to touch poles. I have no idea why – but if I didn't do these things, something terrible would happen."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghpostgazette.com/TV/20030620monk0620fnp5.asp|title=TV Preview:'Monk' returns for more disorder-ly police work|author=Gillies, Judith|date=June 20, 2003|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=December 25, 2008[/tpl]
