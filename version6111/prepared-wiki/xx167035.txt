"Come and Get Your Love" is a 1974 hit single by the Native American rock band, Redbone. The song was written by band member Lolly Vegas and produced by Lolly and his brother Pat Vegas, who was also a band member. It was originally featured on Redbone's album, Wovoka; later the song appeared on many "greatest hits" albums released by the band, as well as on numerous compilation albums of the 1970s. The song peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in April 1974.  It spent 18 weeks in the Top 40 and landed as the 4th most popular song on the Hot 100 for 1974. The single was certified gold by the RIAA on April 22, 1974, which indicates that it had sold over a million copies in the United States. The song is Redbone's highest charting single and one of two Top 40 hits by the band (an earlier recording, "The Witch Queen of New Orleans", peaked at number 21 in 1972).  The song "Come and Get Your Love" also exists in a longer version, with an introductory slow part, plus a longer repeated coda. However, most radio stations rarely play it on the air.
