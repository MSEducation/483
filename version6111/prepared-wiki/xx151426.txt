Beverly Lewis is a Christian fiction novelist and adult and children's author of over 80 books.
She was born Beverly Marie Jones, and is a former schoolteacher and musician.  She started playing the piano at age five, and began writing short stories and poetry when she was nine years old.  
Much of her writing focuses on the Anabaptist heritage and the Old Order Amish. Her maternal grandmother, Ada Ranck Buchwalter, was born into an Old Order Mennonite Church, which interested Mrs. Lewis in her own "plain heritage." Her father was a pastor in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (the heart of the Pennsylvania Dutch community), where she was born and grew up.  She was raised and continues to be part of the Assemblies of God community.
She went to Evangel University, and received the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 2003.  She is also a member of the National League of American Pen Women.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.americanpenwomen.org/ |title=NLAPW â€” Linking Creative Women Since 1897 |publisher=Americanpenwomen.org |date=2012-05-25 |accessdate=2012-11-07[/tpl]
