==Controversy==

In May 2007, actress Michelle Rodriguez criticized Curve magazine and accused its editors of attempting to "out" her. She posted the following on her blog; "...but when people come out of nowhere and put words in my mouth or call me Gay, they should really think for one second How they could truly affect my life by doing such things. You don't know what producer, director, would be husband or future audience member may be influenced by these opinions and media content.""Michelle Rodriguez hits back at Curve magazine", The Advocate, May 5, 2007 Her comments ended up angering many in the gay community and some even accused her of being homophobic. Rodriguez has denied those claims as well.
In the July/August 2007 issue of Curve, editors responded to this criticism by stating: "If you read the article, you will see that the author did not, in fact, 'out' Rodriguez; rather, the article stated both that "Rodriguez has never publicly come out" and "Rodriguez has said she is not a lesbian."
