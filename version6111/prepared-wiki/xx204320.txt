Enchylaena tomentosa, commonly known as Barrier Saltbush or Ruby Saltbush, is a species of small shrub endemic to Australia.

==Description==

It grows as a small shrub, prostrate or erect, up to a metre high. It has slender leaves up to two centimetres long, and fruits that may be green, yellow or red. Both leaves and stems are densely covered in woolly hairs.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | author = Wilson, Paul G. | title = Chenopodiaceae | encyclopedia = Flora of Australia | volume = IV | pages = 213–215[/tpl][tpl]FloraBase | name = Enchylaena tomentosa R.Br. | id = 2511[/tpl]

==Taxonomy==

It was first published by Robert Brown in 1810, as the only species of Enchylaena. Since that time a number of putative new species have been published based on specimens that are now referred to this species; hence it has a number of taxonomic synonyms. Two varieties are recognised: the autonym E. tomentosa var. tomentosa, and a less woolly variety, E. tomentosa var. glabra, which was published by George Bentham in 1870.[tpl]APNI | name = Enchylaena tomentosa R.Br.| id = 39642[/tpl]

==Distribution and habitat==

It occurs throughout Australia, and has also naturalised in New Caledonia. It tolerates a range of soils, but prefers soils that are slightly saline.
