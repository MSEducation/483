Edge of the Century is the twelfth studio album by Styx, released in 1990. It was the first Styx album featuring A&M solo artist Glen Burtnik, the only album to feature the Dennis DeYoung/James Young/Glen Burtnik/Chuck Panozzo/John Panozzo lineup, and the last album to feature John Panozzo on drums (he would die six years later of liver cirrhosis).
The album spawned three singles. "Show Me the Way" was written by DeYoung and peaked at #3, due to the Gulf War Troops adopting the song as an anthem.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] Some radio stations played an edited version with the children of troops singing.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] "Love Is the Ritual", written by Burtnik and Plinky, and "Love at First Sight", written by Burtnik, DeYoung and Young, were also released as singles, but neither garnered the same amount of success as "Show Me the Way".
The album was certified gold by the RIAA.
