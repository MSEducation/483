</ref> One of the Winnipeg statues, the work of architect [[Étienne Gaboury]] and sculptor [[Marcien Lemay]], depicts Riel as a naked and tortured figure. It was unveiled in 1970 and stood in the grounds of the [[Legislative Assembly of Manitoba]] for 23 years. After much outcry (especially from the Métis community) that the statue was an undignified misrepresentation, the statue was removed and placed at the [[Collège universitaire de Saint-Boniface]]. It was replaced in 1994 with a statue designed by [[Miguel Joyal]] depicting Riel as a dignified statesman. The unveiling ceremony was on 16 May 1996, in Winnipeg.<ref name="proceeedings"/>
A statue of Riel on the grounds of the Saskatchewan legislative building in Regina was installed and later removed for similar reasons.
In numerous communities across Canada, Riel is commemorated in the names of streets, schools, neighbourhoods, and other buildings. Examples in Winnipeg include the landmark Esplanade Riel pedestrian bridge linking Old Saint-Boniface with Winnipeg, the Louis Riel School Division, Louis Riel Avenue in Old Saint-Boniface, and Riel Avenue in St. Vital's Minnetonka neighbourhood (which is sometimes called Riel). The student centre and campus pub at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon are named after Riel (Place Riel and Louis', respectively).[ref]
