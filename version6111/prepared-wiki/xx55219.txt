==Route names==

All Muni routes, except the cable cars, have two parts to the name, and are most often referred to by both, for example, the "1 California". The word(s) on the end generally refer to the street encompassing the plurality of the line. This does not mean that the line runs solely on that street (e.g., the 1 California runs on Sacramento and Clay Streets east of Pacific Heights). Bus and trolleybus lines have number designations, rail lines have letters and the three cable car lines are typically referred to by name only (Powell-Mason, Powell-Hyde and California). However, Muni maps abbreviate the cable car route names to PM, PH and C, and they are given route numbers 59, 60 and 61, respectively, for use within Muni operations.

==Fares==

Fares are $2 for adults and $0.75 for seniors over 65, youth aged 5–17, people with disabilities, and Medicare card holders. Proof-of-payment (POP) is handled through a Clipper card, Muni Passport, or a transfer slip (either a piece of newsprint-like paper, torn to indicate expiration time—buses, light-rail vehicles, and streetcars—or machine-printed on thicker tag stock at a few outdoor stops), any of which can be checked by fare inspectors. These transfer receipts allow travel on almost any Muni vehicle for at least 90 minutes but no more than 2 hours from the time of issue. The exception to this is for cable car lines that require a $6 one-way fare with no transfers unless the rider has a Muni Passport or Fast Pass. This monthly pass is $66 for adults ($76 with BART functionality within city limits), $33 for low-income residents ("Life Line Pass"),[ref]
