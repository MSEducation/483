[[Application Exchange]]

CATEGORIES: Internet protocols

Application Exchange (APEX) was an early proposal to the IETF of a standard protocol for instant messaging.  It was based on XML, but is no longer being considered for use.  Today, SIP and SIMPLE, and XMPP are currently being discussed for use as an instant messaging protocol.  Proponents of APEX have now mostly put their support behind XMPP as it is also based on XML.
