[[List of Constellation missions]]

CATEGORIES: Constellation program, Constellation program missions, Lists of space missions

As of early 2009, crewed flights for NASA Project Constellation missions were planned to begin around 2014; an independent assessment by the Augustine Commission estimated that this would not occur until 2017-2019. The first launch of the suborbital Ares I-X launch system was in October, 2009, with a second test launch scheduled for 2012. However, on February 1, 2010, President Obama announced a proposal to cancel the Constellation program with the U.S. 2011 fiscal year budget.
Tests of the Launch Abort System were conducted in 2010.
The test flight of Ares V was planned for 2018, with lunar return flights beginning in 2019; the Augustine Commission estimated this would not actually occur until the late 2020s.

==Development of mission plans==

In October 2006 NASA released a draft schedule of all planned NASA Project Constellation missions through 2019.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=4859 | title=NASA sets Orion 13 for Moon Return | date=11 Oct 2006 | publisher=NASAspaceflight.com[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://pmchallenge.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/2007Presentations/Presentations/Hanley_Jeff.pdf | title = Constellation Program Initial Capability Content (PMR Rev. #1) | publisher = NASA[/tpl] This document included descriptions of a series of proposed vehicle test missions. In July 2007 the schedule was reviewed.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/182032main_MPIM-rev-2007-07-10-01.pdf | title = Multi-Program Integrated Milestones | publisher = NASA|date=2007-07-10|accessdate=2007-09-21|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080221181814/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/182032main_MPIM-rev-2007-07-10-01.pdf|archivedate=2008-02-21[/tpl] In January 2008 the schedule was again reviewed.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5335 | title = $700m gap threatens major delays to Ares test flights/development | publisher = NASAspaceflight.com|date=2008-01-18|accessdate=2008-02-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080122130302/http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5335  |archivedate = 2008-01-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/forums/get-attachment-big.asp?action=view&attachmentid=38704 | title = Manifest Comparison PMR07 vs. PMR08 Guidelines | publisher = NASA|date=2008-01-18|accessdate=2008-02-01[/tpl] The most recent published set of milestones is from February 2009.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/255656main_MPIM-rev-FY2009-Q2%20(FINAL).pdf | title = Multi-Program Integrated Milestones, Q2 FY 2009 | publisher = NASA|date=2009-02-03|accessdate=2009-07-20|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091028004948/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/255656main_MPIM-rev-FY2009-Q2%20(FINAL).pdf|archivedate=2009-10-28[/tpl] Also, an independent assessment by the Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee in October 2009 found that under NASA's current plans and budget the Ares I would not be ready to launch until 2017-2019, with the Ares V not available until the late 2020s.

==Ascent abort tests==

These will be conducted using the Orion Abort Test Booster (ATB), similar to the Little Joe II used for Apollo testing. A boilerplate Orion capsule[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=20883 | title=NASA GRC Solicitation: NASA Abort Test Boilerplate Crew Module Gaseous Nitrogen Cold-gas Reaction Control System | publisher=SpaceRef.com | date=June 8, 2006[/tpl] and the escape tower will be tested on these missions.

==Pad abort tests==

These will test the launch escape system of the Orion spacecraft on the launchpad.
