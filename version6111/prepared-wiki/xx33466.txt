Ultima Online (UO) is a graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), released on 24 September 1997, by Origin Systems. It was instrumental to the development of the genre, and is still running today. The game is played online, in a fantasy setting similar to that of the other Ultima games that preceded it.
The success of Ultima Online opened the door for the creation of many new massively multiplayer games. Ultima Online is a fantasy role-playing game set in the Ultima universe. It is online-only and played by thousands of simultaneous users (who pay a monthly fee) on various game servers, also known as shards. It is known for its extensive player versus player combat system. To maintain order in the online community, there are Game Masters who resolve player disputes, police the shard for terms of service violations, and correct glitches in the game.
Since its release, it has added eight expansion packs, a booster pack, and dozens of free content updates. The release of Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn in 2007 brought a new game engine with a newer visual experience.
Ultima Online was "The first MMORPG to reach the 100,000 subscriber base, far exceeding that of any game that went before it".[tpl]cite web |title=EA Announces Ultima Online(TM): Kingdom Reborn (Working Title); The Game That Firmly Established the MMORPG Genre Receives a Massive Visual Overhaul and New Content in 2007 |url=http://investor.ea.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=314331 |publisher=Electronic Arts |accessdate=3 May 2011 |date=24 August 2006[/tpl] Since Ultima Online[tpl]-'[/tpl]s prime in 2003, the overall subscriber base has seen a steady decline. Subscriber numbers peaked at around 250,000 in July 2003, and in 2008 sat around 100,000 subscribers. As of April 2008, Ultima Online held a market share below 0.6% of the massively multiplayer online game subscriptions.
It was announced on 6 February 2014 that development of the game would be transferred from Mythic to a newly made studio (Broadsword) which will take over all future development of the game.http://www.uo.com/article/Producer-Letter-0

==History==

Ultima Online is the product of Richard Garriott's idea for a fantasy game involving several thousand people who can all play in a shared fantasy world. There were a number of prior games that allowed hundreds of people to play at the same time, including Habitat (beta-tested in 1986), The Realm Online, Neverwinter Nights (the AOL version), and Meridian 59; however, Ultima Online was intended to be a significant improvement over the previous games, both graphically and in game mechanics. The initial team was composed of Garriott, Starr Long, Rick Delashmit and, a bit later Raph Koster, who became the lead designer for the project. Koster wrote a number of public "designer letters" and usually went by his nickname of Designer Dragon. Koster drew inspiration from a number of prior online games[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.raphkoster.com/gaming/book/3b.shtml |title=Raph Koster's Website |publisher=Raphkoster.com |accessdate=2012-07-29[/tpl] such as DartMUD.Koster MUD-Dev Posting "DartMUD was influential on me, certainly—ought to have been for everyone."
The project started in 1995 and was shown to the public at E3 in 1996. The development cost was much greater than traditional computer games; it relied on people accessing servers via modem. Ultima Online initial features included persistent player housing, skill-based character progression (without levels or classes), a crafting and player-driven economy, and unrestricted player-versus-player combat.
Upon release, Ultima Online proved to be very popular, reaching 100,000 paying subscribers within six months of release, despite severe lag problems. Subscriptions continued to grow for several years, reaching a peak of some 250,000 paid accounts. Origin was able to make a great deal of money from the monthly fees required to play Ultima Online and many other companies took note and began development of their own massively multiplayer games.

==Game mechanics==

Ultima Online continued the tradition of previous Ultima games in many ways, but due to advancing technology and the simple fact that it was Origin's first persistent online game, there were many new game mechanics as well. Partially designed as a social and economic experiment, the game had to account for the widespread player interaction as well as deal with the long history of players feeling as if they were the center of attention, as had been the case in single-player games. New to both the developers and the players, a lot that was planned never happened, and a lot that was unexpected did, and many new game mechanics were integrated to compensate.

===Artificial Life Engine===

Starr Long, the game's associate producer, explained in 1996:
However, this feature never made it beyond the game's beta stage. As Richard Garriott explained:
[tpl]quote|We thought it was fantastic. We'd spent an enormous amount of time and effort on it. But what happened was all the players went in and just killed everything; so fast that the game couldn't spawn them fast enough to make the simulation even begin. And so, this thing that we'd spent all this time on, literally no-one ever noticed – ever – and we eventually just ripped it out of the game, you know, with some sadness.[tpl]cite web|last=Garriott|first=Richard|title=Good Game interview|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/webexclusives/|work=in conversation with Bajo of Good Game|publisher=ABC Television, Australia|accessdate=3 March 2011[/tpl][/tpl]

===Worlds===

The game began with a single world, with specific expansion packs adding additional territory and new worlds. Beginning with the first expansion (Ultima Online: The Second Age), the original world gained the "Lost Lands", with additional land, dungeons, creatures, and terrain. It was only by the second expansion that a second and separate world, Trammel, was introduced. This led the developers to distinguish the original world by making the environment more grim, and naming this world "Felucca".[tpl]cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/pc-games/ultima-online-renaissance-pc/1707-9696_7-30976459.html |title=Ultima Online: Renaissance (PC) – PC Games – CNET Archive |publisher=Reviews.cnet.com |accessdate=2012-01-29[/tpl]
There are 2 kind of servers, Normal servers with both Trammel (consensual PVP) and Felucca (non-consensual PVP) ruleset and Siege servers, that is advance servers with non-consensual PVP and no item insurance. The Siege servers are limit to one character slot on an account, limits to ways of traveling and there are some other limits too.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uo.com/Players-Guide |title=www.uo.com/Players-Guide |accessdate=2013-08-15[/tpl]
The worlds in Ultima Online include:

==Issues faced==

Ultima Online has seen many major revisions throughout its history. This includes gameplay revisions, staff changes, technical revamps, porting the backend to Unix, and fundamental design changes. With few earlier MMORPGs to take lesson from, the staff behind Ultima Online were breaking new ground and had to solve complex issues that had never been faced in a commercial game on such a wide scale before. Understanding psychology, social interaction, economy, and other issues became increasingly important as complex social behavior evolved.
Throughout the pre-release development of the game, a well-balanced, realistic economy and social structure was the goal. While not all of the features planned for incorporation made it into the first release, the developers did manage to give almost all of the control to the players in terms of what they could do to each other and the world as a whole.
Another problem throughout Ultima Online's history has been flaws that allowed for cheating. In early years, methods to duplicate items were discovered and many took advantage of this loophole to mass-produce gold and items, causing great harm in the game's economy and power structure. Even after this method was fixed, other methods were discovered over the years which bypassed server and game mechanics to duplicate items and gold. With the introduction of cross-shard character transfers, massive duplication between worldwide servers started to occur, greatly injuring the game economy.
Ultima Online was sued by former player volunteers ("Counselors") and settled in 2004 without admitting wrongdoing.[tpl]cite web|author=by T.L.

==Expansions, sequels and other releases==

Throughout Ultima Online's history, there have been many major additions to the game. Two sequels were attempted and expansions have been released regularly.

===Sequels===

Two sequels were planned by Electronic Arts, but both were canceled during development so that more focus could be spent on the original game.

===Expansions===

Expansions have been released regularly, all of which add new content in the form of landmass, art, quests, items, or game mechanics.

===Booster packs===

At a public relations event on 28 August 2010 it was announced that the development team was moving to a "booster" style development process.[tpl]cite web|author = Electronic Arts|url = http://uo.stratics.com/uoherald/news/news.php?newsid=1078|title = Town Hall Event Announcing Adventures on the High Seas|publisher = Electronic Arts|date = August 2010|accessdate = 2011-05-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Crowner|first=Calvin|title=Producers Update – 9/3/10|url=http://uo.stratics.com/uoherald/news/news.php?newsid=1086|accessdate=3 May 2011|date=3 September 2010[/tpl] The stated goal was to release two boosters per year.[tpl]cite web|last=Crowner|first=Calvin|title=Producer's Update – 9/10/2010|url=http://uo.stratics.com/uoherald/news/news.php?newsid=1087|accessdate=3 May 2011|date=10 September 2010[/tpl]

===Other releases===

Ultima Online has had several special releases which were not expansions, but came with boxed or in-game extras.

==Shard emulation==

Fans of Ultima Online have reverse-engineered the game to produce server emulators of the original Electronic Arts servers. With the modern emulation server software available today, it is possible to customize most aspects of the game and support large numbers of concurrent players on a single server.

==Clients==

Electronic Arts provides the standard clients with which players are allowed to connect to the Ultima Online servers, though some third-party clients have also been made.

===Original client===

The original Ultima Online client is 2D and, while it was state of the art when released, it is intended to be used on low-end machines that cannot support the more taxing 3D client. It also presents a crisper, simpler artistic flavor that some people find more attractive than the 3D client. Many of the graphics used are high-resolution versions of graphics used in Ultima VIII: Pagan.

===Ultima Online: Third Dawn client===

The 3D client was originally released as a part of the Ultima Online: Third Dawn expansion, but has received poor reviews from both veteran and new players alike due to a large number of performance issues (especially memory leaks early on) and what many see as sub-par graphics. An update to the 3D client was made on 30 January 2006 when characters and creatures from the game were scaled down to smaller sizes.
As of early May/Late April 2007, the Third Dawn client is no longer supported by Electronic Arts, and focus was shifted to the Kingdom Reborn client and its successor the Enhanced Client. Electronic Arts Ultima Online servers will no longer allow the Third Dawn client to connect.

===Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn client===

Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn was announced in August 2006 and was released 27 August 2007. The new client, according to the Ultima Online team at Electronic Arts, was created for the purpose of modernizing the game's look, making it easy to add new content without backsliding through outdated and outmoded art, while maintaining the niche market as an MMORPG that can be run on lower-end computers. Electronic Arts has referred to the Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn client as "2.5d," meaning that it was written in 3d and then effectively backslid into 2d to make it, in theory, easier for lower-end computers to run. The client is available as a free download for current players of the game.
Statements made by Electronic Arts originally stated that the Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn client would replace the long-standing Ultima Online client. However, at the first of several Electronic Arts-sponsored players' conventions referred to as "UO Town Meetings," in Atlanta, Electronic Arts representatives suggested that the two clients would exist side-by-side until about 80% of the players had switched over to the new client. The support for this client is ended on 9 September 2009, to streamline the patch process prior to the release of the Ultima Online: Stygian Abyss expansion.[tpl]cite web|last=Zeeman|first=Chrissay|title=Kingdom Reborn Client|url=http://uo.stratics.com/uoherald/news/news.php?newsid=928|accessdate=2 May 2011|date=7 September 2009[/tpl]

===Enhanced Client===

A modified version of the Kingdom Reborn client, renamed as the "Enhanced Client," was introduced as part of the Stygian Abyss expansion. It was released as an open beta in July 2009 and the changes included enhanced macro abilities, a more configurable interface, changes to the mapping system, and graphical improvements.[tpl]cite web|last=Crowner|first=Calvin|title=New Client Open Beta|url=http://uo.stratics.com/uoherald/news/news.php?newsid=863|accessdate=3 May 2011|date=17 July 2009[/tpl] The enhanced graphics of the Kingdom Reborn client had been retired in favor of lower resolution original graphics that more closely resembled the original 2D client. This graphic set was based on the Third Dawn client and was previously available in the Kingdom Reborn client as optional original graphics.

==Timeline==

In May [tpl]vgy|1996[/tpl], Ultima Online: Shattered Legacy is shown at the 1996 E3 Expo. Then, in August 1997, Lord British had an unfortunate accident. While giving a speech to a bright-eyed Britannian crowd, the King was engulfed in flames and spent some time in the realm of the dead. He was killed by Rainz, who was later banned from the game for reasons unrelated to the killing. Later, with the aid of his companions, he was revived and finished his speech, much to the delight of those in attendance.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Five Biggest Moments in UO History|publisher=Computer Gaming World|date=2 November 2002|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_220.pdf[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2002/06/52894|title=Make Love, Not War Games|author=Brad King|date=8 June 2002|publisher=Wired (magazine)[/tpl]
September 1997 was the last day of the original beta test. The beta ended with a bang, as players were treated to an "end of the world" scenario with Shadowlords, demons, and other evil creatures slaughtering every character in sight. Ultima Online opened its doors to the public.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/03/04/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/|title=Electronic Arts' online folly|author=Chris Morris|date=4 March 2003|publisher=CNN[/tpl] In 1998, the game expanded, and the number of users reached over 100,000 worldwide. In 1999, the game expanded to Japan in January, to Europe in May, and to South Korea in July.
In [tpl]vgy|2000[/tpl] the game expands to Australia. Lord British disappears. Rumors fly on the wind about the disappearance of the King. Some claim he was abducted by mongbats, while others insist that it was the work of more malevolent forces. In February, a massive army of undead laid siege to the once peaceful city of Trinsic. Due to the overwhelming odds, the dark army managed to conquer the city under the leadership of Juo'nar and the Dark Mistress Minax. All hope seemed to be lost, but noble Britannians from all over rallied together and reclaimed the city from the clutches of evil! In May, Ultima Online's second expansion marked the beginning of a new era in Britannia. With the splitting of the lands into the facets of Trammel and Felucca, players could choose their geography based on their play style. November 2000 marked the UO World Faire. Players from all over met and mingled in Austin, TX at Ultima Online's first official fanfest.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-68511984/uo-fans-get-medieval.html|title=UO Fans Get Medieval – Wine, women, and song at the Ultima Online World Faire.|publisher=Computer Gaming World|date=1 February 2001[/tpl]
Ultima Online's third expansion occurred in March 2001, introducing the new land of Ilshenar, new beasts and monsters, and an entirely new way to view the game. Online Worlds FanFest. Ultima Online's second official fanfest, Online Worlds FanFest, was held in Austin, TX in January 2002. Players were able to meet the Developers behind the game, as well as special guest speaker Todd McFarlane. February 2002 marked Lord Blackthorn's Revenge. Ultima Online's fourth expansion brought players into a world under siege, replete with more than 30 new and exotic characters created by none other than Spawn creator Todd McFarlane. However, in May, Royal Knight of Britannia, leads the fight against Blackthorn and Exodus. He would be slain in June 2003.
Ultima Online's fifth expansion in [tpl]vgy|2003[/tpl] was the most aggressive yet, offering players the ability to custom design their homes, the Paladin and Necromancer professions, a new land called Malas, and 13 new combat moves. In March 2003 Ultima Online reached 250,000 subscribers. Lord British returns in September 2003, the same month as the game's 6th anniversary.
Ultima Online: Samurai Empire launched in November 2004. Samurai Empire is a Japanese-themed expansion, offering two new professions, the Ninja and the Samurai, as well as new Japanese-themed housing tile sets. New lands, the Tokuno Islands, were added, with the cities being styled after ancient Japanese cities. Ultima Online: Mondain's Legacy was then launched in August 2005. This is the first time Ultima Online allows for more than one player race, as Elves are added. The quest system received a major upgrade, as did the crafting system. Spellweaving was added to the skills. Many new dungeons were added to existing areas. This expansion was also the first that was only available online (offline versions on CDs could be ordered).
In June 2006, Electronic Arts announced that PunkBuster would be integrated into Ultima Online. This marked the first time PunkBuster would be used with an MMORPG to help curb cheating/exploiting. However, this was never integrated into the game, and in November 2006, Electronic Arts announced that the integration of PunkBuster would be put on an indefinite hold. In August of that year Ultima Online: Kingdom Reborn was announced. This was the first major overhaul of the client and artwork systems since Ultima Online: Third Dawn.
