==History==

The building currently used as Tyngsborough Middle School had been used as the high school until 1988.  The current high school building was built next to the old one, and used to house both the Junior and Senior High Schools from grades seven through twelve.  In 2003 with the construction of a new elementary school in the district during the previous year, younger students were moved out of the old high school, which had been used for grades three through six, and the seventh and eighth graders moved into the old high school building which became Tyngsborough Middle School.  This left the ninth through twelfth graders in the current high school building.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.toddjerseyarchitecture.com/artman2/publish/schools/Tyngsborough_High_School.shtml |title=Todd Jersey Architecture Tyngsborough High School |publisher=Town of Tyngsborough |year= |accessdate=2011-05-26[/tpl]

The team would win the CAC title two more years in '04 and '05 (although losing in the playoff round those two years). This long-time dominance was a crucial reason for THS leaving the CAC in 2007.
They entered the Dual County League in 2007. The school experienced little to no success in most sports in the DCL, largely owing to the smaller number of students. In 2011, the athletic program transitioned from Eastern to Central MA, joining the Midland-Wachusett League, C division.
