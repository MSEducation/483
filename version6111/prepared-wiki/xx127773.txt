Yvon Pierre Lambert (born May 20, 1950 in Drummondville, Quebec) is a retired Canadian ice hockey forward.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=2933|title=Yvon Lambert|publisher=hockeydb.com|accessdate=2009-04-04[/tpl]
Yvon started his National Hockey League career with the Montreal Canadiens in 1973.  He would spend nine years in Montreal before being traded to the Buffalo Sabres.  Yvon is best known for scoring the winning goal in overtime of game 7 of the 1979 Stanley Cup Semi-Finals against the Boston Bruins, the culmination of an exciting game most memorable for a career-damaging coaching error by Don Cherry with two minutes left in regulation. Lambert won four consecutive Stanley Cups with the Habs from 1976 to 1979.
