==History==

The last inhabitants Earle and Clark Steere founded the Warwick Cove Marina respected by the community and offspring of Arthur Steere which was the Senator and best friend to Roger Williams. Patience Island was given to both of them as a gift by the Indians to show good faith for early colonization of Rhode Island history.
The island and others nearby were named by Roger Williams and other early colonists.  Colonial school children often recited the poem: "Patience, Prudence, Hope and Despair. And the little Hog over there."http://lighthouse.cc/prudence/history.html  Patience Island became part of Portsmouth in 1664.
