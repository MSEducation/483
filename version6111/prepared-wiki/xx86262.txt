No Said Date is the solo debut album by Wu-Tang Clan member Masta Killa, an American hip hop musician.  With dark and dramatic beats and samples from martial arts films (most notably, the song "Masta Killa" which featured samples of Bruce Lee), the album has a sound reminiscent of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) as it features all nine of the original Wu-Tang Clan members, including Ol' Dirty Bastard (in his last musical appearance before his death in 2004).

Prefixmag.com gave the album a 7.0/10 rating saying: "No Said Date hearkens naturally back to the independent glory of 36 Chambers in its recognizable beat-smithing and refreshing flow from one of Wu-Tang's least-known members."Masta Killa: No Said Date
Rapreviews.com gives it a 9/10 as reviewed by James Corne stating: "No Said Date is a near classic album that will hold a place in any listener's archive for a long time to come."Masta Killa :: No Said Date :: Nature Sounds/Little Shoes Music
Hiphopsite.com claims that the album "ought to be enough to satisfy all but the most demanding Wu-Tang fans. And in a time where hip-hop hasn't seen a legitimately classic, well-rounded album in years, No Said Date holds up as a solid, entertaining and overall satisfying debut."[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]
