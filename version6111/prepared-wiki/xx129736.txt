==Notable shows==

===Haigh Hall show===

The Haigh Hall show in Wigan, UK, was the bands homecoming gig, as they had not played in their home city since 1992 on the Gravity Grave Tour. The band were supported by John Martyn, Beck (who was playing his only UK date of that year) and Eumir Deodato. The show was a complete sell out and became one of the band's most famous performances.

===Slane Castle show===

The final gig on the tour was the annual Slane Concert, which The Verve headlined. They were backed by David Gray, James, Robbie Williams and the Manic Street Preachers. The show was almost at full capacity, with over 80,000 fans purchasing tickets. It proved to be the band's last gig until their 2007 reunion. The show ended with a 15 minute jam of "Bitter Sweet Symphony".
