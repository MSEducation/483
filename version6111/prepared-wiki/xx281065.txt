Trans Arabia Airways was a Kuwaiti airline. It had its headquarters in the Karnak Building in Kuwait City.

==History==

The carrier started operations in [tpl]start date|1959|9[/tpl] serving the Beirutâ€“Kuwait route with a Douglas DC-4 that previously belonged to Australian National Airways. Shortly after those flights began, a second DC-4 was chartered from Starways to boost capacity in the route. In [tpl]start date|1960|3[/tpl], the airline placed a provisional order for two Argosy aircraft; however, this order never materialised, and the airline ordered three Douglas DC-6Bs instead.
By [tpl]end date|1964|4[/tpl], the Trans Arabia Airways fleet included three Douglas DC-6Bs to serve a route network that comprised seven destinations in the Middle East, including Bahrain, Beirut, Cairo, Damascus, Doha, Jeddah, Jerusalem, and three in Europe, including Frankfurt, London and Rome; that month, the airline was absorbed by Kuwait Airways.[tpl]rp|855[/tpl]
