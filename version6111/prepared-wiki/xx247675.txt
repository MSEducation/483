Soul Fighter is a beat 'em up video game developed by Toka for the Sega Dreamcast home  console in 1999.

==Plot==

An evil curse has fallen on the Kingdom of Gomar. As a mysterious mist envelopes the kingdom, the inhabitants turn into vicious creatures. A fearless warrior (Atlus), a female spy (Sayomi), and a powerful wizard (Orion) have escaped the fate of their fellow villagers. They must now search for and capture souls in order to reverse the curse.

==Development==

Soul Fighter was developed by the French company Toka with help from upstart company Piggyback Interactive.[tpl]cite web | author=Justice, Brandon | date=August 12, 1999 | title=Soul Fighter Slips | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/08/13/soul-fighter-slips | publisher=IGN | accessdate=January 5, 2014[/tpl] The 15-person team at Toka created the game using the 3dfx Interactive Glide API for PC hardware in the same fashion as Midway Games' San Francisco Rush, NFL Blitz, and NBA Showtime. Although Soul Fighter cannot be run with Glide on the Dreamcast, the software allowed \Toka to port the game from the PC to console in less than three weeks.[tpl]cite web | author=Kennedy, Sam | date=June 16, 1999 | title=Hands-on: Soul Fighter | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/hands-on-soul-fighter/1100-2451077/ | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=GameSpot | accessdate=January 5, 2014[/tpl]
Production on Soul Fighter was originally set to be finished in July 1999 with the game slated for release at the North American launch of the Dreamcast. A delay set its release back to an October ship date. After settling on a publisher in Mindscape, Soul Fighter was delayed again from a October 1999 release to the following month.[tpl]cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop | date=October 14, 1999 | title=Soul Fighter Bitten by the Delay Bug | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/15/soul-fighter-bitten-by-the-delay-bug | publisher=IGN | accessdate=January 5, 2014[/tpl] Piggyback consulted with a Japanese publisher at one point to transform Soul Fighter into an arcade game; the company had also considered a version for the PlayStation 2. A planned port of the game for the GameCube was announced but eventually cancelled.[tpl]cite web | author=IGN staff | date=February 6, 2002 | title=Soul Fighter, Hidden Invasion Announced | url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/324/324077p1.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate=April 5, 2012[/tpl]
