[[List of newspaper comic strips]]

CATEGORIES: Comic strips, Lists of comic strips, Lists of books by type

The following is a list of comic strips. Dates after names indicate the time frames when the strips appeared. There is usually a fair degree of accuracy about a start date, but because of rights being transferred or the very gradual loss of appeal of a particular strip, the termination date is sometimes uncertain. In the event a strip has its own page, the originator of the strip is listed. Otherwise, all creators who worked on a strip are listed. Note that many of characters appeared in both strip and comic book format as well as in other media.
The word Reuben after a name identifies winners of the National Cartoonists Society's Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year, but many of leading strip artists worked in the years before the first Reuben and Billy DeBeck Awards in 1946.National Cartoonists Society
