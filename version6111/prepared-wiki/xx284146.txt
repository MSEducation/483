The RideLondon–Surrey Classic forms part of the RideLondon weekend, a two-day cycling festival held in London which is a legacy event of the 2012 Summer Olympics.

This sportive starts on the morning of the elite race.

==History==

===Origins===

The RideLondon event, including the RideLondon–Surrey Classic, is a legacy event of the 2012 Summer Olympics and the idea for the elite race can be traced back to the successful organisation and public reaction to the Olympic Road Cycling races in 2012 and the Olympic test event, the London-Surrey Cycle Classic, held a year earlier.
The route chosen for the RideLondon–Surrey Classic is a variation on that used by both the London-Surrey Cycle Classic and the Olympic Road Cycling races.

===London-Surrey Cycle Classic===

A part of the London Prepares series a one-off one-day [tpl]convert|140|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] cycle race was organised for the 14 August 2011 acting as a test event for the Olympic Road Cycling events to be held the following year. The race was named the London-Surrey Cycle Classic and was part of the 2010–11 UCI Europe Tour as a 1.2 category event.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uci.ch/templates/BUILTIN-NOFRAMES/Template1/layout.asp?MenuId=MTYzMzQ&LangId=1|title=UCI Road Calendar — 2010-2011 Europe Tour|accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]
