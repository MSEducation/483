Amadeus IV (1197 – 24 June 1253) was Count of Savoy from 1233 to 1253.
Amadeus was born in Montmélian, Savoie.  The legitimate heir of Thomas I of Savoy and Margaret of Geneva, he had however to fight with his brothers for the inheritance of Savoy lands after their father's death. His brothers Pietro and Aimone spurred a revolt in Aosta Valley against Amadeus, but he was able to crush it with the help of Manfred III of Saluzzo and Boniface II of Montferrat, who were his sons-in-law. Together with his brother Thomas, he fought against the communes of Turin and Pinerolo, but with uncertain results.
He was succeeded by his young son Boniface, who died soon.
