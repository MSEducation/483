All territories of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean recognise same-sex marriages performed in the European territory of the Netherlands as a result of a Dutch Supreme Court ruling. The Supreme Court ruled that that all vital records recorded in the Kingdom of the Netherlands were valid throughout the kingdom; this was based on its interpretation of the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands. However, subsequent rulings have established that same-sex marriages are not automatically entitled to the same privileges (e.g., social security) extended to married couples of the opposite sex.[tpl]nl[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title=hoger beroep zaak BM9524|url=http://jure.nl/bm9524|accessdate=18 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]nl[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title=hoger beroep zaak BL1992|url=http://jure.nl/bl1992|accessdate=18 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]nl[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title=hoger beroep zaak BI9335|url=http://jure.nl/bi9335|accessdate=18 December 2010[/tpl]

Same-sex marriages and registered partnership performed elsewhere, have a legal status on the islands since 2011.

===Opposition===

After the Dutch parliament legalized same-sex marriage, the Protestant Church in the Netherlands permitted individual congregations to decide whether or not to bless such relationships as a union of love and faith before God, and in practice many churches now conduct such ceremonies.National Service Centre PCN, The Uniting Protestant Churches in the Netherlands and homosexuality, November 2004.
Local governments are obliged to perform civil same-sex marriages, and they can require their personnel to conduct marriages for same-sex couples; however, if their existing contract did not state this requirement, they cannot be fired over a refusal. Some local councils choose not to require registrars who object to same-sex marriage to perform ceremonies.
In 2007, controversy arose when the new government (Fourth Balkenende cabinet) announced in its policy statement that officials who object to same-sex marriage on principle may refuse to marry such couples.[tpl]nl[/tpl] 'Ambtenaren kunnen homo-huwelijk weigeren' Some Socialist and Liberal dominated municipal councils opposed this policy, claiming that the job of a registrar is to marry all couples, regardless of gender.[tpl]nl[/tpl] [tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ad.nl/rotterdam/hoeksewaard/article1187841.ece|title=PvdA en GroenLinks: ambtenaren mogen homohuwelijk niet weigeren|date=2007-03-17|publisher=Algemeen Dagblad|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930033354/http://www.ad.nl/rotterdam/hoeksewaard/article1187841.ece|archivedate=2007-09-30|accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl] The opposition parties stated that if a registrar opposed same-sex marriages, he or she should not hold that post.[tpl]nl[/tpl] Alle ambtenaren moeten homo's trouwen
The municipality of Amsterdam announced that they would not comply with this policy, and that registrars there would still be obliged to marry same-sex couples.[tpl]nl[/tpl] Amsterdam wil sluiten homohuwelijk verplichten In reaction to this, many other municipalities announced their rejection of this proposal as well. The Balkenende government claimed that this issue lay solely within the remit of the central government. In practice, municipalities decide whether or not to hire registrars who object to marrying same-sex couples.

===Statistics===

According to provisional figures from Statistics Netherlands, for the first six months, same-sex marriages made up 3.6% of the total number of marriages: a peak of around 6% in the first month followed by around 3% in the remaining months: about 2,100 men and 1,700 women in total. By June 2004, more than 6,000 same-sex marriages had been performed in the Netherlands.Homosexual unions slowly gain momentum in Europe[tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl]
In March 2006, Statistics Netherlands released estimates on the number of same-sex marriages performed in each year: 2,500 in 2001, 1,800 in 2002, 1,200 in 2004, and 1,100 in 2005.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/03/032006dutchWed.htm|title=Netherlands' Gay Marriages Level Off|last=Thornberry|first=Malcolm|publisher=365Gay|date=2006-03-20|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060321154857/http://365gay.com/Newscon06/03/032006dutchWed.htm|archivedate=2006-03-21|accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl]
From 2001 to 2011 there were 14,813 same-sex marriages, 7,522 between two women and 7,291 between two men. In the same period there were 761,010 heterosexual marriages. There were also 1,078 same-sex divorces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/node/337783 |title=Ten years of same-sex marriage: a mixed blessing |publisher=Rnw.nl |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2014-04-05[/tpl]

==Registered partnership==

On 1 January 1998, registered partnerships ([tpl]lang-nl|geregistreerd partnerschap[/tpl]) were introduced in Dutch law. The partnerships were meant for same-sex couples as an alternative to marriage, though they can also be entered into by opposite-sex couples, and in fact about one third of the registered partnerships between 1998 and 2001 were of opposite-sex couples. In law, registered partnerships and marriage convey the same rights and duties, especially after some laws were changed to remedy inequalities with respect to inheritance and some other issues.

==Unregistered partnership==

Unregistered partnerships or informal cohabitation is when same-sex or opposite sex couples live together as a couple but they choose to keep the legal status of their relationship unregistered or informal. This means all worldwide assets that belong to a single party remain the sole property of the party with no legal entitlement by the other party, whether owned before or acquired during the relationship. This legal status of unregistered partnership is respected by Dutch courts.[tpl]cite web|url=https://same-sex.web.ined.fr/pdf/DocTrav125/05Doc125TheNetherlands.pdf |title=Major legal consequences of marriage, cohabitation and registered partnership for different-sex and same-sex partners in the Netherlands|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=2011-12-26[/tpl]

==Public opinion==

According to the Ifop poll, conducted in May 2013, 85% of the Dutch supported allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt children.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Enquête sur la droitisation des opinions publiques européennes
