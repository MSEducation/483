==Career==

===Theatre===

Having fallen in love with actress Jane Holland, McKern moved to the United Kingdom to be with her; they married in 1946. He soon became a regular performer at London's Old Vic theatre and the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre (now the Royal Shakespeare Theatre) in Stratford-upon-Avon, despite the difficulties posed by his glass eye and Australian accent.
McKern's most notable Shakespearean role was as Iago in Othello, in 1952. He originated the role of Common Man in Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons in the West End in 1960, but for the show's Broadway production appeared as Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex—a role that he would reprise for the 1966 film version. He also portrayed Subtle in Ben Jonson's The Alchemist in 1962. In 1965, he played the eponymous villain in Bolt's The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew, and Disson in Harold Pinter's Tea Party.

===Film===

McKern's film debut was in Murder in the Cathedral (1952). His other notable film appearances included the science-fiction classic The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961), the Beatles' film Help! (1965), the Academy Award-winning adaptation of A Man for All Seasons (1966), The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968), Ryan's Daughter (1970), Massacre in Rome (1973), The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother (1975),The Omen (1976), The Blue Lagoon (1980), The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981) and Ladyhawke (1985). He was presented with the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Travelling North (1987). In Monsignor Quixote (1985), he co-starred as Sancho Zancas opposite Alec Guinness as Father Quixote.

===Television===

One of McKern's earliest television roles was in the 1950s black-and-white series The Adventures of Robin Hood (as Sir Roger DeLisle, usurper of the Locksley manor and lands, and Herbert of Doncaster, a corrupt moneylender). During the 1960s, he was one of several Number Twos in the groundbreaking and critically acclaimed TV series The Prisoner. Along with Colin Gordon, McKern was one of only two actors to play Number Two more than once. He first played the character in the episodes "The Chimes of Big Ben" and "Once Upon a Time", and later reprised the role in the final episode, "Fall Out". The filming of "Once Upon a Time" proved to be a particularly intense experience for McKern; according to one biographer, the stress caused him to suffer either a nervous breakdown or a heart attack (accounts differ), forcing production to stop for a time.  In 1976 McKern narrated and presented The Battle of the Somme a BBC documentary marking the 60th anniversary of the WWI battle.

====Rumpole of the Bailey====

In 1975, McKern made his first appearance in the role that would make him a household name as an actor, Horace Rumpole, whom he played in Rumpole of the Bailey, a BBC Play for Today. A series of the same name, comprising 44 episodes, was produced for ITV between 1978 and 1992. John Mortimer, series creator and writer, wrote the part with actor Alastair Sim in mind, but, as Mr Sim was unavailable due to his sad demise in 1976, McKern was chosen for the part. According to Mortimer, "he not only played the character Rumpole—he added to it, brightened it and brought it fully to life."http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E6DF1238F937A15754C0A9649C8B63 New York Times, 24 July 2002
Although he enjoyed the role McKern expressed doubts about its popularity and the extent to which his life was becoming intertwined with Rumpole's. "McKern was often unhappy, decrying his television fame as an 'insatiable monster'. He stressed that his Peer Gynt was a greater performance and lamented: 'If I get an obit in any paper, they will say, "... of course, known to millions as Rumpole"'."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/global/main.jhtml?xml=/global/2002/07/24/brkern24.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Expat[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl] In the later series, his daughter Abigail McKern joined the cast as Liz Probert.

In the 1990s, McKern appeared in a series of advertisements for Lloyds Bank, widely shown on British television, in which he portrayed a character reminiscent of Rumpole.
