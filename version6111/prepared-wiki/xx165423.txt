She is best known for writing the hit song "You Give Good Love" recorded by Whitney Houston for her self-titled debut album in 1985 that sold over 15 million units.

==History==

LaLa took up the piano at the age of five and gave a piano recital at Carnegie Hall at the age of nine.
After leaving New York's High School of Music and Art, she formed a band called Jack Sass, which played Top 40 cover versions on the club scene.
As the group's reputation grew, La La began introducing more of her own songs into the repertoire before she went to Juilliard to major in composition.
In 1981, she was invited to tour with Stacy Lattisaw who opened for The Jacksons on a national tour.
Following this she sang with the group Change, along with Luther Vandross, where her voice was heard on their tune 'The Glow Of Love', co-written by her childhood friend from East Elmhurst, Queens, Wayne K. Garfield.
She played one of her songs, 'Stone Love', to another neighborhood friend, Kashif, who recorded it on his debut album in 1983.

==Songs==

LaLa has penned songs for many artists inclcuding Lillo Thomas ('All Of You'), Melba Moore ('Living For Your Love' and 'It's Really Love'), Glenn Jones ('Show Me' and 'Stay'), Giorge Pettus ('My Night For Love') and a solo release Into The Night which was featured on the 'Beat Street' soundtrack album.
Through Kashif, she had a couple of her tunes recorded by Whitney Houston ('You Give Good Love' and 'Thinking About You') before signing to Arista (both Kashif and Whitney Houston's label) as an artist. In 1987 she released a debut album, La La, including 'We'll Keep Striving' (a duet with Bernard Wright), but she left the label shortly afterwards.
LaLa also wrote for Carl Anderson and Stephanie Mills in addition to further songs for herself, after a move to Motown Records in the early nineties. Her debut Motown album was La La Means I Love You in 1991.
