Groningen ([tpl]IPA-nl|ˈɣroːnɪŋə(n)|-|000 Groningen.ogg[/tpl]; Gronings: Grunnen; West Frisian: Grins) is the main municipality as well as the capital city of the eponymous province in the Netherlands. With a population of [tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Dutch municipality population|Groningen[/tpl][/tpl] (in [tpl]YEAR|[tpl]Dutch municipality population|popbaseyear[/tpl][/tpl]), it is the largest city in the north of the Netherlands. An old city, Groningen was the regional power of the northern Netherlands, a semi-independent city-state and member of the German Hanseatic League. Groningen is a university city: the University of Groningen (about 28,000 students) and Hanze University of Applied Sciences (about 25,000 students).

==History==

The city was founded on the northernmost point of the Hondsrug area. The oldest document referring to Groningen's existence dates from 1040. However, the city already existed long before then: the oldest archaeological traces found are believed to stem from the years 3950–3720 BC, although the first major settlement in Groningen has been traced back to the 3rd century AD.
In the 13th century, when Groningen was an important trade centre, its inhabitants built a city wall to underline its authority. The city had a strong influence on the surrounding lands and made its dialect a common tongue. The most influential period of the city was the end of the 15th century, when the nearby province of Friesland was administered from Groningen. During these years, the Martinitoren was built, which loomed over the city at (then) 127 metres tall, making it the highest building in Europe at the time. The city's independence came to an end when it chose to join forces with the Spanish during the Eighty Years' War in 1594. It later switched sides, joining the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands.
In 1614, the University of Groningen was founded, initially only for religious education. In the same period the city expanded rapidly and a new city wall was built. That same city wall was tested during the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672, when the city was attacked fiercely by the bishop of Münster, Bernhard von Galen. The city walls resisted, an event which is celebrated with music and fireworks on 28 August (as "Gronings Ontzet" or "Bommen Berend").
The city did not escape the devastation of World War II. In particular, the main square, Grote Markt, was largely destroyed in April 1945, at the Battle of Groningen. However, the Martinitoren, its church, the Goudkantoor, and the city hall were not damaged. The battle there lasted several days.

==University of Groningen==

The University of Groningen (in Dutch: Rijksuniversiteit Groningen) has a rich academic tradition which dates back to 1614. After the University of Leiden, it is the oldest university located in the Netherlands. The university educated the first female student (Aletta Jacobs) and the first Dutch national astronaut (Wubbo Ockels), the first president of the European Central Bank and a Nobel prize winner (Heike Kamerlingh Onnes). They share their academic roots with around 200,000 people, who were either students, teachers or researchers at the university. Groningen has the highest percentage of students by total population, approximately 25 percent.

==Art, culture and nightlife==

The city is nationally known as the "Metropolis of the North" and as "Martinistad" referring to the Martinitoren.
Although Groningen is not a very large city, it does have an important role as the main urban centre of this part of the country, particularly in the fields of music and other arts, education, and business. The large number of students living in Groningen also contributes to a diverse cultural scene for a city of its size.

===Museums===

The most important and most famous museum in Groningen is the Groninger Museum. With the construction of its current building, designed by Alessandro Mendini, the museum has been transformed into one of the most modern and innovative of its kind in the Netherlands. In addition, the city also has a maritime museum, a university museum, a comics museum and a graphical museum. Groningen is also home of Noorderlicht, an international photographic platform that runs a photo gallery and organizes an international photo festival.

===Theatre and music===

Groningen has its own city theatre (Stadsschouwburg), located on the Turfsingel; a big theatre and concert venue called Martini Plaza; and another major cultural venue on the Trompsingel, called the Oosterpoort. Vera is located on the Oosterstraat, Grand Theatre on the Grote Markt, and Simplon on the Boterdiep. Several cafes feature live music, a few of which specialize in jazz music, including Jazzcafe De Spieghel on the Peperstraat. The jazz music students from the Prins Claus Conservatorium have been known to hold regular jam sessions in cafes such as Peter Pan on the Voor Het Voormalige Klein Poortje and café De Smederij on the Tuinstraat 2–4. Groningen is also the host city for the Eurosonic Festival, an annual music showcase event for over a hundred bands from all over Europe.

===Nightlife===

Groningen's nightlife depends largely on its student population. Its cultural scene is vibrant and remarkable for a city of its size. In particular, the Grote Markt, the Vismarkt, the Poelestraat and Peperstraat are crowded every night of the week, and most bars do not close until 7 in the morning. Between 2005 and 2007, Groningen was elected "de beste binnenstad" (the best city centre) of the Netherlands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.debestebinnenstad.nl/winnaars/winnaars-2005-2007/grote-binnenstad/|language=Dutch|title=Winnaars 2005 - 2007 -- Verkiezing Beste Binnenstad|trans_title=Winners 2005 - 2007 -- Election Best City Centre|publisher=www.debestebinnenstad.nl|accessdate=15 February 2012[/tpl] There are also two red-light districts, one in Nieuwstad (a street) and one in the A-kwartier'' (an area). Both of them are in or near the city centre.

==International relations==

Groningen is twinned with the following cities:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.groningen.nl/functies/pagfunctie.cfm?parameter=1285|title=Groningen – Partner Cities|publisher=2008 Gemeente Groningen, Kreupelstraat 1,9712 HW Groningen |accessdate=8 December 2008[/tpl]

==Industry==

Until recently, there were two large sugar refineries inside the city boundaries. The Suiker Unie plant was originally outside of Groningen, but it was completely swallowed by the expansion of the city. After a campaign to close the factory, it was finally shut down in 2008/2009. Before closing down, the sugar production amounted to 250,000 tonnes of beet sugar, with 250 employees (2005 figures). The only remaining sugar factory is CSM Vierverlaten in Hoogkerk, which produces 235,000 tonnes of beet sugar, with 283 employees.
Other well known companies from Groningen are Hooghoudt (a producer of alcoholic beverages, genever and beerenburg, among others), publishing house Wolters-Noordhoff and Theodorus Niemeyer (a coffee, tea and tobacco company).

==Transport==

===Cycling and walking===

Groningen has been called the "World Cycling City" because 57% of journeys within the city are made by bicycle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalideasbank.org/site/bank/idea.php?ideaId=378|title=global ideas bank |publisher=globalideasbank.org |date=15 October 2007 |accessdate=14 July 2009[/tpl] Like most Dutch cities, Groningen is well adapted to the high number of cyclists. A large network of bike paths make it convenient to cycle to various destinations and within the town the bike is the most popular means of transportation. In 2000, Groningen was chosen as Fietsstad 2002 — the top BikeCity of the Netherlands for 2002.
The city is very much adapted to the wishes of those who want to get around without a car, as it has an extensive network of segregated cycle-paths, good public transport, and a large pedestrianised zone in the city centre. The transformation of the historic centre into a pedestrian priority zone enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable, safe and enjoyable.
These attributes are accomplished by applying the principle of "filtered permeability". It means that the network configuration favours  active transportation and selectively, “filters out” the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre. In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces increasing the enjoyment of the trip (see image). The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts – the Fused Grid. In the Italian TV programme of investigative journalism "Report" appeared a short film,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rai.tv/mpplaymedia/0,,RaiTre-Report%5E23%5E37292,00.html |title=Rai.tv |publisher=Rai.tv |date=15 October 2007 |accessdate=5 May 2009[/tpl]  considering the use of bikes in Groningen a good practice to emulate in Italy.

Groningen planned to build a tram route connecting the central station, via the university hospital with the university complex (Zernike), and the central station via the city center with the Park & Ride and sportscenter at Kardinge . However in October 2012 the city council decided not to build the tramlines due to the high costs.
