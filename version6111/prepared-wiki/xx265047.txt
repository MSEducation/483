The Mind's Eye is a video analysis research project using artificial intelligence. It is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.[tpl]cite news|last=Lohr|first=Steve|title=Computers That See You and Keep Watch Over You|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/science/02see.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all|accessdate=December 15, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 2011[/tpl]

==Mission==

"The Mind's Eye program seeks to develop in machines a capability that exists only in animals: visual intelligence. This program pursues the capability to learn generally applicable and generative representations of action between objects in a scene directly from visual inputs, and then reason over those learned representations. A key distinction between this research and the state of the art in machine vision is that the latter has made continual progress in recognizing a wide range of objects and their properties - what might be thought of as the nouns in the description of a scene. The focus of Mind's Eye is to add the perceptual and cognitive underpinnings for recognizing and reasoning about the verbs in those scenes, enabling a more complete narrative of action in the visual experience."[tpl]cite web|title=Mind's Eye|url=http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Minds_Eye.aspx|publisher=DARPA Information Innovation Office|accessdate=6 December 2012[/tpl]
