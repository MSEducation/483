[[Number sign]]

CATEGORIES: Typographical symbols

Number sign is a name for the symbol #, which is used for a variety of purposes, including the designation of a number (for example, "#1" stands for "number one"). 
The term number sign is most commonly used when the symbol is used before a number; in the United States the term pound sign is catching on; the telephone key is called the "pound key".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/24/magazine/on-language-hit-the-pound-sign.html| title=On Language; Hit the Pound Sign | author=William Safire | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=May 21, 2011 | date=March 24, 1991[/tpl] Outside of North America the symbol is called hash and the corresponding telephone key is called the "hash key" (and the term "pound sign" often describes the British currency symbol "£"). The symbol is defined in Unicode as [tpl]unichar|0023|Number sign|html=|note=as in ASCII[/tpl].
The symbol is easily confused with the musical symbol called sharp ([tpl]music|sharp[/tpl]). In both symbols, there are two pairs of parallel lines. The key difference is that the number sign has true horizontal strokes while the sharp sign has two slanted parallel lines which must rise from left to right, in order to avoid being confused with the musical staff lines. Both signs may have true vertical lines; however, they are compulsory in the sharp sign, but optional in the number sign (#) depending on typeface or handwriting style.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==Origin and usage and naming conventions in North America==

Mainstream use in the United States is as follows: when it precedes a number, it is read as "number", as in "a #2 pencil" (spoken aloud as: "a number-two pencil"). A theory claims that back in early 1900, the Teletype Corporation was the first to use # to mean "number".
It is often claimed that the pound name derives from a series of abbreviations for pound, the unit of weight. The theory goes that at first "lb." was used; however, printers later designed a font containing a special symbol of an "lb" with a line through the verticals so that the lowercase letter "l" would not be mistaken for the numeral "1". Unicode character [tpl]unichar|2114|L B BAR SYMBOL|html=[/tpl] is a cursive development of this symbol. Ultimately, the symbol was reduced for clarity as an overlay of two horizontal strokes "=" across two forward-slash-like strokes "//".[tpl]cite news|last=Houston|first=Keith|title=The Ancient Roots of Punctuation|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/09/origins-of-hashtag-manicule-diple-pilcrow-ampersand-explained.html|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=2013-09-06[/tpl]  Keith Gordon Irwin, in The Romance of Writing, p. 125, says "The Italian libbra (from the old Latin word libra, 'balance') represented a weight almost exactly equal to the avoirdupois pound of England. The Italian abbreviation of lb with a line drawn across the letters ℔ was used for both weights.
An alternative theory is that the name “pound sign” is a result of the fact that character encodings have historically used the same code for both the hash symbol and the British pound sign "£". It is sometimes supposed that the problem originated in ISO 646-GB, but it seems more likely that it has its origin in Baudot code in the late 19th century.[tpl]cite web|title=The "pound sign" mystery|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2461|accessdate=22 December 2012[/tpl]
In Canada the symbol is commonly called the number sign. Major telephone-equipment manufacturers, such as Nortel, have an option in their programming to denote Canadian English, which in turn instructs the system to say "number sign" to callers instead of "pound sign".

==Usage in the United Kingdom and Ireland==

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the symbol is most often called the hash (a corruption of "hatch",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/84445|title=Hash sign|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=14 October 2013[/tpl] referring to cross-hatching). It is never used to denote pounds weight (lb is commonly used for this) or pounds sterling (where "£" is used). It is never called the "pound sign", because that term is understood to mean the currency symbol "£", for pound sterling or (formerly) Irish pound.
While the use of "#" as an abbreviation for "number" is widely understood in Britain and Ireland, it is generally not used in writing. Where Americans might write "Symphony #5", the British and Irish are more likely to write "Symphony No. 5", or use the numero sign "Symphony № 5".
To add to the confusion between "£" and "#", in BS 4730 (the UK national variant of the ISO/IEC 646 character set), 0x23 represents "£" whereas in ASCII (the US variant), it represents "#". It was thus common, when systems were incorrectly configured, for "£" to be displayed as "#" and vice versa.

==Other names in English==

The symbol has many other names (and uses) in English:

==In mathematics==

==In computing==

==In popular culture==

==Other uses==

==Unicode==

In Unicode, several # characters are assigned:
In other languages or scripts:

==On keyboards==

On the standard US keyboard layout, the # symbol is [tpl]keypress|Shift|3[/tpl]. On standard UK and some European keyboards, the same keystrokes produce the pound currency symbol (£), and # is moved to a separate key above the right shift. On UK Mac keyboards, # is generated by [tpl]keypress|Opt|3[/tpl], whereas on European Mac keyboards, the # can be found above the right shift key.
