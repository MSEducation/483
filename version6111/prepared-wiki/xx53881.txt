Folklorama is an event that runs for two weeks each August in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Visitors to the festival are invited to sample exotic cuisine and celebrate the cultural and ethnic heritage of people from dozens of countries who have made Winnipeg their home. Folklorama is the world's largest and longest-running multicultural festival.[tpl]cite web|title=Folklorama kicks off this weekend|url=http://www.globalwinnipeg.com/folklorama+kicks+off+this+weekend/6442691374/story.html|publisher=Global News|accessdate=6 August 2012|date=3 August 2012[/tpl]
Each country, region or culture has an assigned venue, known as a pavilion. Typically there are over 40 pavilions presented throughout the city, with half operating in week one and half in week two of the festival.[tpl]cite web|title=What to Expect|url=http://www.folklorama.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=57&Itemid=13|accessdate=1 August 2012[/tpl]  Each pavilion presents a show featuring the song and dance of their culture, along with trademark ethnic cuisine and a cultural display. Some pavilions also incorporate additional services such as henna tattoo application, and some have late night parties. Most pavilions provide imported alcohol from their feature country.
Folklorama provides exposure to cultural groups and brings in thousands of tourists each year, adding to the city's economy. It is the largest and longest-running festival of its kind in the world (acknowledged by the International Council of Organizations for Folklore Festivals and Folk Art, also known as CIOFF).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cioff.org/events-festivals.cfm|title=Festivals|publisher=http://www.cioff.org|accessdate=1 August 2012[/tpl] The Folk Arts Council of Winnipeg is the organizing body of Folklorama.

==History==

Folklorama was first held in August 1970. It was originally intended to be a one-time occurrence in celebration of Manitoba's centennial. It was deemed such a success that it became an annual event. The first festival was only a week long, featuring 21 different cultures; it drew approximately 75,000 separate pavilion visits."History". Folklorama. http://www.folklorama.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=56. Accessed 14-07-2009. The festival adopted its current two-week format in 1988, with half of the pavilions open in each week. As of 2007, only five of the original pavilions have been open every year. They are: German, Philippine-Nayong Pilipino, Ukraine-Kyiv, Greek and Scandinavian."FAQs". Folklorama. http://www.folklorama.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=55&Itemid=53.

The festival's mascot, the Folklorama Llama, was created in 1986.
Until 1990, pavilions would have a mayor and a queen.  The queen would be in the running for the Miss Folklorama pageant at the end of the festival. The Miss Folklorama pageant was not a beauty pageant but a contest of ethnic preservation and presentation. Since 1990, pavilions now feature two adult (male and female) ambassadors and two (male and female) youth ambassadors.[tpl]cite web|title=FOLKLORAMA|url=http://www.afro-caribbean.org/events/folklorama/|publisher=Afro-Caribbean Association of Manitoba|accessdate=13 August 2012[/tpl]
