Dress Barn (currently styled as dressbarn) is an American retailer of women's clothing.

==History and operations==

The first Dress Barn was opened in 1962 in Stamford, Connecticut, by Roslyn Jaffe. Jaffe saw the opportunity to provide wear-to-work dresses and clothing for the working woman during a time in the U.S. when women were entering the workforce and there were few options. 
The company began trading on NASDAQ (symbol DBRN) in 1982. In January 2011, to reflect the company's broader holdings,[tpl]cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=81419&p=irol-newsArticle&t=Regular&id=1511802& |title=The Dress Barn, Inc.

At this time the NASDAQ symbol was also changed to ASNA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/dress-barn-inc/index.html |title=Ascena Retail Group Inc. - Company Information |publisher=The New York Times |date= |accessdate=January 17, 2012[/tpl]
Ascena also owns the Maurices, Justice, Lane Bryant, and Catherines clothing store brands. The Dress Barn brand targets women ages 35-50. Dress Barn, Dress Barn Woman (larger sizes), and combination stores sell in-season women's apparel and accessories at value prices and cater to professional women. Chairman Elliot Jaffe and his wife and co-founder, Roslyn, own about 25% of The Dress Barn.
In 2009, DressBarn expanded into the girls' clothing market by purchasing Tween Brands, the owner of the Justice chain of 891 stores. Justice, which is aimed at girls between ages 7 and 14, is the effective successor of Limited Too, originally launched in 1987 by The Limited to serve the same market. In 1999, The Limited spun off Limited Too as a separate company. In 2004, Limited Too launched the Justice chain, aimed at a lower price point in the same market. Limited Too changed its name to Tween Brands in 2008, and the company had almost completely converted its remaining Limited Too stores to Justice stores at the time of the DressBarn acquisition.
David Jaffe, president and chief executive officer of Ascena, said Dressbarn is opening a New York design studio.
In November 2013, Judith Langley, who was executive vice president and chief merchandising officer at Charming Charlieâ€™s, was appointed executive vice president and chief merchandising officer. She replaced Keith Fulsher, who retired.
