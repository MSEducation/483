The Legion of Super-Villains is a team of fictional supervillains that appear in comic books published by DC Comics. They are adversaries of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the future. They first appeared as adults in Superman #147 (1961) and as teens in Adventure Comics #372 (1968).

==Fictional team history==

Pre-Crisis the Legion first appears when Lex Luthor creates a radio to contact the future, hoping to send a message to a Legion of Super-Villains, feeling there must be an evil counterpart to the Legion of Super-Heroes. He is broken out of jail by a gun, flying belt, and force-field helmet being sent into his cell. He then meets the trio of villains, Cosmic King, Lightning Lord and Saturn Queen, who tell him of their origins. They cause trouble for Superman and finally an illusion cast by Saturn Queen succeeds in luring him to a planetoid, where a kryptonite field holds him. He is told the origins of the Legion, and sentenced to death in a parody of the way the Legion of Super-Villains voted him in, but the adult Legion of Super-Heroes appears and battles their foes. Luthor threatens to kill Superman, but Saturn Woman offers herself in his place. Superman asks for a tribute to her and is released after promising not to rescue her. He uses part of Saturn's rings to create a ring round the planetoid, causing Saturn Queen to hyptonize[tpl]clarify|date=April 2013|reason=hypnotize?[/tpl] the villains before they can kill Saturn Woman, as it is revealed Saturn's rings somehow make the inhabitants stay good. Saturn Queen is given a fragment to make sure she stays good, and the other villains are jailed. However they would battle Superman at other points, such as during Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?, where they create a force field around the Fortress of Solitude to stop other heroes helping Superman, before fleeing back to the future when Superman brutally attacks Lightning Lord.
Pre-Crisis, the Legion of Super-Villains was founded by Tarik the Mute, who had suffered irreparable damage to his vocal cords during a battle with the Science Police and subsequently developed a pathological hatred of law and order.[tpl]Issue|date=October 2009[/tpl] He founded a school for supervillains, which served as the headquarters and recruiting grounds for the Legion's first incarnation.[tpl]Issue|date=October 2009[/tpl] He blackmailed Colossal Boy into joining as a teacher.[tpl]Issue|date=October 2009[/tpl]
Several other incarnations of the group formed over the years, led first by Sun Emperor and then by Nemesis Kid.[tpl]Issue|date=October 2009[/tpl] In the last incarnation they conquered the low-tech planet of Orando, homeworld of Princess Projectra, and slipped it into another dimension as a base of operations.[tpl]Issue|date=October 2009[/tpl] Each villain was sworn to kill one Legionnaire, but only Nemesis Kid succeeded, fatally wounding Karate Kid.[tpl]Issue|date=October 2009[/tpl]
In post-Crisis continuity, some of the members of the Legion of Super-Villains attempted to remake the universe by tampering with the origins of Superman and Batman and adopting them as their own "children," eventually transforming them into dictators of Earth, and eliminating other members of the JLA to stop them interfering. Superman and Batman managed to overcome their brainwashing, however, due to the Darkseid of another reality telling them what had happened, restored the timestream to its proper course, and took the villains to the 31st century to be imprisoned, but kept the memories of their lives with the villains.Superman/Batman #14-18 (Januaryâ€“April 2005)

Each member is later given copies of the Legion of Super-Heroes' flight rings bearing Prime's "S" symbol. The Legion of Super-Villains later appear on Sorcerer's World as Mordru is trying to stop Dawnstar, Wildfire, Blok, and Green Lantern/Legionnaire Rond Vidar from rescuing the White Witch. The White Witch manages to create a stargate, but Rond forces them through and is left to fight the Legion by himself. After Vidar has fought off several Legion members, Saturn Queen gets inside his head and starts to hinder his willpower. When Prime grabs Rond by the neck, Saturn Queen tells him to wait, since Rond is Universo's son. Universo shows no care for Rond and only wants his power ring. Rond mocks him, telling him it can never be his, and spits in his face before Prime snaps his neck. Universo tries to take his ring, but it flies off to Oa. Mordru is then offered membership in the Legion, telling him it can only be temporary, which is the same case for the Fatal Five and the Justice League. Earth Man sums up that as much as the various villains dislike each other, they all want the Legion of Super-Heroes dead. They head for Earth and launch an attack on the Legionnaires.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #2 (November 2008) Eventually, the tide turns against them as the White Witch uses Mordru's spell "Aufero magus infusco!" three times to absorb Mordru and his magic.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5 (September 2009)
