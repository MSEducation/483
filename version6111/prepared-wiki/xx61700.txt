Anchorite or anchoret (female: anchoress; adj. anchoritic; from [tpl]lang-grc|ἀναχωρητής[/tpl],[tpl]LSJ|a)naxwrhth/s|ἀναχωρητής|ref[/tpl] "one who has retired from the world", from the verb [tpl]lang|grc|ἀναχωρέω[/tpl],[tpl]LSJ|a)naxwre/w|ἀναχωρέω|ref[/tpl] anachōreō, signifying "to withdraw", "to retire") denotes someone who, for religious reasons, withdraws from secular society so as to be able to lead an intensely prayer-oriented, ascetic, and—circumstances permitting—Eucharist-focused life. As a result, anchorites are usually considered to be a type of religious hermit,BBB Radio 4: Making History – Anchorites (being similar to hermits in seeking to live a solitary life devoted to God, although distinct in being permanently enclosed in cells which were usually attached to churches) although there are distinctions in their historical development and theology.
The anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of Christian monastic living. It is perhaps best known surviving archaeological and literary evidence of its existence in medieval England.  In the Roman Catholic Church today it is one of the "Other Forms of Consecrated Life" and governed by the same norms as the consecrated eremitic life.The Code of Canon Law 1983, canon 603

==Anchoritic life==

The anchoritic life became widespread during the early and high Middle Ages. Examples of the dwellings of anchorites and anchoresses survive. They tended to be a simple cell (also called anchorhold), built against one of the walls of the local village church.Tom Licence, Hermits and Recluses in English Society 950-1200, (Oxford, 2011), pp. 87-9 In the Germanic lands from at least the tenth century it was customary for the bishop to say the office of the dead as the anchorite entered her cell, to signify the anchorite's death to the world and rebirth to a spiritual life of solitary communion with God and the angels. Sometimes, if the anchorite was walled up inside the cell, the bishop would put his seal upon the wall to stamp it with his authority. But some anchorites freely moved between their cell and the adjoining church.Licence, Hermits and Recluses, pp. 123, 120.
Hearing Mass and receiving Holy Communion was possible through a small, shuttered window in the common wall facing the sanctuary, called a "hagioscope" or "squint".  There was also a small window facing the outside world, through which the inhabitant would receive food and other necessities and, in turn, could provide spiritual advice and counsel to visitors, as the anchorites gained a reputation for wisdom.Licence, Hermits and Recluses, pp. 158-72
Anchorites were supposed to remain in their cell in all eventualities. Some were even burned in their cells, which they refused to leave even when pirates or other attackers were looting and burning their towns.Licence, Hermits and Recluses, pp. 77-9 They ate frugal meals, and spent their days both in contemplative prayer and interceding on behalf of others. Anchorite hymns such as Ignus Lux Sanctum, praising the sanctity of light in all its forms, were the inspiration for Athanasius Kircher's research on optics and magnetism. Anchorites' bodily waste was managed by means of a chamber pot.The Anchoress on line . Q&As Accessed October 2008
An idea of their daily routine can be gleaned from an anchoritic Rule. The most widely known today is the early-thirteenth-century text known as Ancrene Wisse.Ancrene Wisse Another, less widely known, example is the rule known as De Institutione Inclusarum written around 1160-2 by Aelred of Rievaulx for his sister.Translated by Mary Paul MacPherson in Treatises and the Pastoral Prayer, Cistercian Fathers Series 2, (Kalamazoo, 1971). In English the work is variously titled The Eremitical Life, The Rule of Life for a Recluse and The Training of Anchoresses. It is estimated that the daily set devotions detailed in Ancrene Wisse would take some four hours, on top of which anchoresses would listen to services in the church, and engage in their own private prayers and devotional reading.Ancrene Wisse, trans Hugh White, (Penguin, 1993), p.viii

==Famous anchorites==

The beginnings of such a life are falling somewhere in the third century AD, for example St. Hilarion (Gaza, 291. - Cyprus,371.)was greatly honored as the founder of anchoritic life in Palestine (Catholic encyclopedia, ST. JEROME, Vita S. Hilarionis in P.L., III, 29-54).
The anchoritic life proved especially popular in England. Well-known anchorites include:
In total, there is evidence for the existence of around 780 anchorites on 600 sites in England between 1100 and 1539, when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries and brought anchoritism in England to an end. Women were more numerous among the anchorites than men - considerably so in the thirteenth century.Ancrene Wisse, trans Hugh White, (Penguin, 1993)
Good examples of English anchorholds can still be seen at Chester-le-Street in Durham, and at Hartlip in Kent.
