[[Underlying representation]]

CATEGORIES: Phonology

In some models of phonology as well as morphophonology in the field of linguistics, the underlying representation (UR) or underlying form (UF) of a word or morpheme is the abstract form that a word or morpheme is postulated to have before any phonological rules have applied to it.[tpl]cite book|last=Bromberger|first=Sylvain|title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2006|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|location=Detroit|pages=551-553|edition=2nd|coauthors=Morris Halle|editor=Donald M.

The concept of an underlying representation is central to generative grammar.[tpl]cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics|year=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken|page=501|chapter=underlying (adj.)[/tpl] 
If more phonological rules apply to the same underlying form, they can apply wholly independently of each other or in a feeding or counterbleeding order. The underlying representation of a morpheme is considered to be invariable across related forms (except in cases of suppletion), despite alternations among various allophones on the surface.

==Examples==

In many cases, the underlying form is simply the phonemic form. For example, in many varieties of American English, the phoneme [tpl]IPA|/t/[/tpl] in a word like wet can surface either as a glottalized [tpl]IPA|tˀ[/tpl] or as a flap [tpl]IPA|ɾ[/tpl], depending on environment: [tpl]IPA|ˈwɛtˀ[/tpl] wet vs. [tpl]IPA|ˈwɛɾɚ[/tpl] wetter. (In both cases, however, the underlying representation of the morpheme wet is the same: its phonemic form [tpl]IPA|/wɛt/[/tpl].)
Phonological rules may change the phonemes involved. In such cases, pipes ("|") or double slashes may be used in transcription to distinguish the underlying form from its phonemic realization. For example, the word "cats" has the phonemic representation [tpl]IPA|/ˈkæts/[/tpl]. If it is assumed that the underlying form of the English plural suffix is a [tpl]IPA|z[/tpl] sound, the underlying form of "cats" would be [tpl]IPA|//ˈkætz//[/tpl]. (The [tpl]IPA|z[/tpl] surfaces as an [tpl]IPA|s[/tpl] due to the phonological process of devoicing after an unvoiced consonant.)
Sandhi, such as the tone sandhi of the Chinese languages, is another phonological process that changes the phonemes of a morpheme from its underlying form.
