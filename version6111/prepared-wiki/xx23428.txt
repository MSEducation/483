Rupert Chawner Brooke (middle name sometimes given as "Chaucer"; 3 August 1887 – 23 April 1915The date of Brooke's death and burial under the Julian calendar that applied in Greece at the time was 10 April.  The Julian calendar was 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar.) was an English poet known for his idealistic war sonnets written during the First World War, especially "The Soldier". He was also known for his boyish good looks, which were said to have prompted the Irish poet W. B. Yeats to describe him as "the handsomest young man in England".

==Early life==

Brooke was born at 5 Hillmorton Road, Rugby in Warwickshire, the second of the three sons of William Parker Brooke, a Rugby schoolmaster, and Ruth Mary Brooke, née Cotterill. He was educated at two independent schools in Rugby: Hillbrow School and Rugby School.
While travelling in Europe he prepared a thesis, entitled "John Webster and the Elizabethan Drama", which won him a scholarship to King's College, Cambridge, where he became a member of the Cambridge Apostles, was elected as President of the Cambridge University Fabian Society, helped found the Marlowe Society drama club and acted in plays including the Cambridge Greek Play.

==Life and career==

Brooke made friends among the Bloomsbury group of writers, some of whom admired his talent while others were more impressed by his good looks. Virginia Woolf boasted to Vita Sackville-West of once going skinny-dipping with Brooke in a moonlit pool when they were in Cambridge together.Vita Sackville-West letter to Harold Nicolson, 8 April 1941, reproduced in Nigel Nicolson (ed.), Harold Nicolson: The War Years 1939–1945, Vol. II of Diaries and Letters, Atheneum, New York, 1967, p. 159
Brooke belonged to another literary group known as the Georgian Poets and was one of the most important of the Dymock poets, associated with the Gloucestershire village of Dymock where he spent some time before the war. He also lived in the Old Vicarage, Grantchester.
Brooke suffered a severe emotional crisis in 1912, caused by sexual confusion and jealousy, resulting in the breakdown of his long relationship with Ka Cox (Katherine Laird Cox).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32093?docPos=1|title=‘Brooke, Rupert Chawner (1887–1915)’|first=Adrian|last=Caesar|format=subscription required|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/32093|accessdate=12 January 2008[/tpl] Brooke's paranoia that Lytton Strachey had schemed to destroy his relationship with Cox by encouraging her to see Henry Lamb precipitated his break with his Bloomsbury group friends and played a part in his nervous collapse and subsequent rehabilitation trips to Germany.Keith Hale, ed. Friends and Apostles: The Correspondence of Rupert Brooke-James Strachey, 1905–1914.
As part of his recuperation, Brooke toured the United States and Canada to write travel diaries for the Westminster Gazette.  He took the long way home, sailing across the Pacific and staying some months in the South Seas. Much later it was revealed that he may have fathered a daughter with a Tahitian woman named Taatamata with whom he seems to have enjoyed his most complete emotional relationship.Mike Read: Forever England (1997) Many more people were in love with him.Biography at GLBTQ encyclopaedia by Keith Hale, editor of Friends and Apostles: The Correspondence of Rupert Brooke-James Strachey, 1905–1914  Brooke was romantically involved with the actress Cathleen Nesbitt and was once engaged to Noël Olivier, whom he met, when she was aged 15, at the progressive Bedales School.
Brooke was an inspiration to poet John Gillespie Magee, Jr., author of the poem "High Flight".  Magee idolised Brooke and wrote a poem about him ("Sonnet to Rupert Brooke").  Magee also won the same poetry prize at Rugby School which Brooke had won 34 years earlier.
As a war poet Brooke came to public attention in 1915 when The Times Literary Supplement quoted two of his five sonnets ("IV: The Dead" and "V: The Soldier") in full on 11 March and his sonnet "V: The Soldier" was read from the pulpit of St Paul's Cathedral on Easter Sunday (4 April).  Brooke's most famous collection of poetry, containing all five sonnets, 1914 & Other Poems, was first published in May 1915 and, in testament to his popularity, ran to 11 further impressions that year and by June 1918 had reached its 24th impression;1914 & Other Poems by Rupert Brooke, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1918 (24th impression). a process undoubtedly fuelled through posthumous interest.

==Death==

Brooke's accomplished poetry gained many enthusiasts and followers and he was taken up by Edward Marsh who brought him to the attention of Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty.  He was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a temporary Sub-Lieutenant[tpl]London Gazette|issue=28906|startpage=7396|date=18 September 1914|accessdate=12 November 2007[/tpl] shortly after his 27th birthday and took part in the Royal Naval Division's Antwerp expedition in October 1914.  He sailed with the British Mediterranean Expeditionary Force on 28 February 1915 but developed sepsis from an infected mosquito bite.  He died at 4:46 pm on 23 April 1915 in a French hospital ship moored in a bay off the island of Skyros in the Aegean on his way to the landing at Gallipoli. As the expeditionary force had orders to depart immediately, he was buried at 11 pm in an olive grove on Skyros, Greece.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/dol/popups/rndofficer1.htm|title=Royal Naval Division service record (extract)|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=11 November 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/dol/popups/rndofficer2.htm|title=Royal Naval Division service record (extract)|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=11 November 2007[/tpl]  The site was chosen by his close friend, William Denis Browne, who wrote of Brooke's death:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2002/May02/WDBrown.htm|title=William Denis Browne (1888–1915)|first=Pamela|last=Blevins|work=Musicweb International|year=2000|accessdate=9 November 2007[/tpl]

The original wooden cross that marked his grave on Skyros, which was painted and carved with his name, was removed to Clifton Road Cemetery in Rugby, Warwickshire, to the Brooke family plot.  When a permanent memorial was made for his grave on Skyros, Rupert Brooke's mother, Mary Ruth Brooke, had the original cross brought from Skyros to Rugby and placed at the plot.  However, because of perishing in the open air, it was removed from the cemetery in 2008, and replaced by a more permanent marker.  The original grave marker from Skyros is now at Rugby School with the memorials of other old Rugbeians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rugbyadvertiser.co.uk/news/features/help-to-design-memorial-to-rupert-brooke-1-1482332 | title = Help to design memorial to Rupert Brooke[/tpl]
