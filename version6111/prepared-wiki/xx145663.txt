Southend was a parliamentary constituency centred on the town of Southend-on-Sea in Essex.  It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
The constituency was created in 1918 by splitting the town of Southend from the existing constituency of South East Essex. The sitting MP for that constituency, Rupert Guinness, was elected to the new constituency. It was abolished for the 1950 general election, when it was divided into the new constituencies of Southend East and Southend West.

===Guinness family===

For most of the 20th century, this constituency and one of its successors was held by four members of the Guinness family. When Rupert Guinness was elevated to the Peerage upon the death of his father, he was succeeded by his wife, Gwendolen. When she retired in 1935 she was succeeded by her eldest daughter's husband, Henry "Chips" Channon. Channon continued to serve as MP for one of the successor constituencies, Southend West, until his death in 1958. That seat was then represented by his son, Paul Channon, until 1997. Because of this connection, the seat became known in the media as "Guinness-on-Sea".Obituary: Lord Kelvedon | Obituaries | Guardian Unlimited
