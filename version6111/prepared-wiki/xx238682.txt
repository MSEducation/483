    * Time Based Access Mechanisms [[Time division multiple access]]: Current 802.11 mesh networks must utilize CSMA/CA in order to
      access the channel. With a large number of users, it may be more efficient to organize access based
      on time. We are interested in applying TDMA schemes over 802.11 in order to boost performance.
    * Exploiting the Multiple Channel Advantage: The access points we have chosen for Quail Ridge
      are equipped with two radios. This will allow us to intelligently and dynamically select channels
      in order to avoid interference on high-traffic links.
