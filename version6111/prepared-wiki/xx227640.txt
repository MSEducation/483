==History==

The team that later formed Ronimo Games initially came together under the name of Banana Games,Developer's site De Blob and created the original freeware PC version of de Blob.Ronimo Games Interview: Swords and Soldiers Publisher THQ noticed the game, was very impressed with the team's work, and acquired the rights to the game. THQ subsequently handed over further development to Blue Tongue Entertainment (Nintendo DS, Wii) and Universomo (Mobile/iPhone/iPod).
With the money earned from selling the rights to de Blob the team founded Ronimo Games. The name "Ronimo" came from a brainstorming session in which the team decided to combine the first letters of the words "Robot Ninja Monkeys".
In May 2009, the studio released the WiiWare title Swords & Soldiers. In September 2010 the game was released for PlayStation Network with publisher Sony Online Entertainment and in December the Windows and Mac version on Steam. In June 2011 the game was ported by Two Tribes and published by Chillingo for iOS.
Currently the studio is developing Awesomenauts, a multiplayer online battle arena for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network. Despite the publisher's financial problems, the game was released on PC at May 2, 2012.http://www.destructoid.com/don-t-worry-awesomenauts-still-being-released-this-week-226749.phtml
