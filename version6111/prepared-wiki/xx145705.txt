Givat Haim (Ihud) ([tpl]Lang-he|גבעת חיים (איחוד)[/tpl], lit. the hill of life Hill (United)) is a kibbutz near Hadera in Israel. It is located within the jurisdiction of the Hefer Valley Regional Council.

==History==

It was formed in 1952 by an ideological split in kibbutz Givat Haim (founded 1932), with Mapam-supporting members forming Givat Haim (Meuhad) which joined the HaKibbutz HaMeuhad movement, and Mapai-supporting members breaking away to create Givat Haim (Ihud), which joined the Mapai-affiliated Ihud HaKvutzot veHaKibbutzim. Today both kibbutzim belong to the Kibbutz Movement.

==Economy==

As well as agriculture, the kibbutz is home to Prigat, a major soft drink company in Israel.
