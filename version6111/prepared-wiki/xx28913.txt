[tpl]IPA notice[/tpl][tpl]sound change[/tpl]
In linguistics, an alternation is the phenomenon of a phoneme or morpheme exhibiting variation in its phonological realization. Each of the various realizations is called an alternant. The variation may be conditioned by the phonological, morphological, and/or syntactic environment in which the morpheme finds itself.
Alternations provide linguists with data that allow them to determine the allophones and allomorphs of a language's phonemes and morphemes and to develop analyses determining the distribution of those allophones and allomorphs.

==Phonologically conditioned alternation==

An example of a phonologically conditioned alternation is the English plural marker commonly spelled s or es.[ref][tpl]cite book |last=Cohn |first=Abigail |chapter=Phonology |pages=202–203 |title=The Handbook of Linguistics |editor=in Mark Aronoff and Janie Rees-Miller (eds.), |year=2001 |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Oxford |isbn=0-631-20497-0[/tpl]

===Morphologically conditioned alternation===

An example of a morphologically conditioned alternation is found in French, where many adjectives have a consonant at the end in the feminine gender that is missing in the masculine:[tpl]cite book |last=Steriade |first=Donca |year=1999 |chapter=Lexical conservatism in French adjectival liaison |editor=in Jean-Marc Authier, Barbara E.

===Syntactically conditioned alternation===

Syntactically conditioned alternations can be found in the Insular Celtic languages, where words undergo various initial consonant mutations depending on their syntactic position.[tpl]cite journal |last=Green |first=Antony D. |year=2006 |title=The independence of phonology and morphology: The Celtic mutations |journal=Lingua |volume=116 |pages=1946–1985 |url=http://roa.rutgers.edu/files/652-0404/652-GREEN-0-0.PDF |doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2004.09.002 |issue=11[/tpl] For example, in Irish, an adjective undergoes lenition after a feminine singular noun:
In Welsh, a noun undergoes soft mutation when it is the direct object of a finite verb:
