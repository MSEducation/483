"Sweet Talkin' Woman" is a 1978 single by Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) from the album Out of the Blue. Its original title was "Dead End Street", but it was changed during recording, perhaps to avoid confusion with a 1966 hit of the same title by The Kinks. Some words that survived from that version can be heard in the opening of the third verse, "I've been livin' on a dead end street".Sweet Talkin' Woman Songfacts
The track became the third top ten hit from the LP in the UK, peaking at number 6. As a novelty, initial copies of the 12" and 7" formats were pressed in transparent purple vinyl.
The version released in the United States was 10 seconds shorter than its British counterpart due to a slightly faster mix. In the US, it reached number 17 on the Billboard chart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/electric-light-orchestra-mn0000163229/awards |title=Electric Light Orchestra - Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=5 March 2013[/tpl]
