Edvard Alexander Westermarck (20 November 1862 â€“ 3 September 1939) was a Finnish philosopher and sociologist. Among other subjects, he studied exogamy and the incest taboo.
The phenomenon of reverse sexual imprinting (when two people live in close domestic proximity during the first few years in the life of either one, both are desensitized to later close sexual attraction), now known as the Westermarck effect, was first formally described by him in his book The History of Human Marriage (1891). 
He has been described as "first Darwinian sociologist" or "the first sociobiologist".Sanderson, SK. "REFORMING THEORETICAL WORK IN SOCIOLOGY: A DETAILED REPLY TO MY CRITICS" 
He helped found academic sociology in the United Kingdom, becoming the first professor of sociology (with Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse) in 1907 in the University of London.
In the UK, his name is often spelled Edward. His sister, Helena Westermarck, was a writer and artist.[tpl]fact|date=April 2014[/tpl]
