CATEGORIES: Blogs, Internet terminology, Literary genres, Words coined in the 1990s

A blog (a truncation of the expression web log)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html|title=Weblogs: A History And Perspective|last=Blood|first=Rebecca|date=September 7, 2000[/tpl] is a discussion or informational site published on the World Wide Web and consisting of discrete entries ("posts") typically displayed in reverse chronological order (the most recent post appears first). Until 2009 blogs were usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject. More recently "multi-author blogs" (MABs) have developed, with posts written by large numbers of authors and professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into societal newstreams. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.
The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users. (Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and FTP had been required to publish content on the Web.)
A majority are interactive, allowing visitors to leave comments and even message each other via GUI widgets on the blogs, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.[tpl]cite book|last1=Mutum|first1=Dilip|last2=Wang|first2=Qing|editor=Neal M.

Eastin|title=Handbook of Research on Digital Media and Advertising: User Generated Content Consumption|volume=1|year=2010|publisher=IGI Global|pages=248–261|chapter=Consumer Generated Advertising in Blogs[/tpl] In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers do not only produce content to post on their blogs, but also build social relations with their readers and other bloggers.[tpl]cite journal|author=Gaudeul, Alexia and Peroni, Chiara |year=2010|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/ebl/ecbull/eb-10-00198.html |title=Reciprocal attention and norm of reciprocity in blogging networks|journal=Economics Bulletin|volume=30|issue=3|pages=2230–2248[/tpl] There are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments, such as Daring Fireball.
Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject; others function as more personal online diaries; others function more as online brand advertising of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, Web pages, and other media related to its topic. The ability of readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important contribution to the popularity of many blogs. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (art blogs), photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs or "vlogs"), music (MP3 blogs), and audio (podcasts). Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts. In education, blogs can be used as instructional resources. These blogs are referred to as edublogs.

==History==

The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/entertainment/theweb/news/2007/12/blog_anniversary|title=After 10 Years of Blogs, the Future's Brighter Than Ever|accessdate=2008-06-05 | work=Wired|date=2007-12-17|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] on 17 December 1997. The short form, "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6794172|title=It's the links, stupid|publisher=The Economist|date=2006-04-20|accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://peterme.com/index.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19991013021124/http://peterme.com/index.html|archivedate=1999-10-13|title=Peterme.com|last=Merholz|first=Peter|publisher=Internet Archive|year=1999|accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kottke.org/03/08/its-weblog-not-web-log|last=Kottke|first=Jason|authorlink=Jason Kottke|title=kottke.org|date=2003-08-26|accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl] Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog") and devised the term "blogger" in connection with Pyra Labs' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.Origins of "Blog" and "Blogger", American Dialect Society Mailing List (Apr. 20, 2008).

===Origins===

Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including Usenet, commercial online services such as GEnie, BiX and the early CompuServe, e-mail listsThe term "e-log" has been used to describe journal entries sent out via e-mail since as early as March 1996.[tpl]cite web|last=Norman|first=David|title=Users confused by blogs|date=2005-07-13|url=http://lists.drupal.org/archives/development/2005-07/msg00208.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070607235110/http://lists.drupal.org/archives/development/2005-07/msg00208.html|archivedate=2007-06-07|accessdate =2008-06-05|format= – Scholar search|postscript=[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=June 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Research staff and students welcome ‘E-Log’|publisher=University College London|date=December 2003|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news-archive/archive/2003/december-2003/latest/newsitem.shtml?03120901|accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl] and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS). In the 1990s, Internet forum software, created running conversations with "threads". Threads are topical connections between messages on a virtual "corkboard".
From 14 June 1993 Mosaic Communications Corporation maintained their "What’s New"What's New!. Home.mcom.com. Retrieved on 2013-06-15. list of new websites, updated daily and archived monthly. The page was accessible by a special "What's New" button in the Mosaic web browser.
The modern blog evolved from the online diary, where people would keep a running account of their personal lives. Most such writers called themselves diarists, journalists, or journalers. Justin Hall, who began personal blogging in 1994 while a student at Swarthmore College, is generally recognized as one of the earlier bloggers,[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/20/MNGBKBEJO01.DTL|title=Time to get a life — pioneer blogger Justin Hall bows out at 31|last=Harmanci|first=Reyhan|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2005-02-20|accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl] as is Jerry Pournelle.[tpl]cite web|work=jerrypournelle.com|url=http://www.jerrypournelle.com/#whatabout |title=Chaos Manor in Perspective|work=Jerry Pournelle's blog|quote= "I can make some claim to this being The Original Blog and Daybook. I certainly started keeping a day book well before most, and long before the term "blog" or Web Log was invented. BIX, the Byte information exchange, preceded the Web by a lot, and I also had a daily journal on GE Genie. All that was long before the World Wide Web." -- Jerry Pournelle|author=Pournelle, Jerry[/tpl] Dave Winer's Scripting News is also credited with being one of the older and longer running weblogs.[ref]
"...Dave Winer... whose Scripting News (scripting.com) is one of the oldest blogs."
[/ref] The Australian Netguide magazine maintained the Daily Net NewsAustralian Net Guide. Web.archive.org (1996-11-12). Retrieved on 2013-06-15. on their web site from 1996. Daily Net News ran links and daily reviews of new websites, mostly in Australia.  Another early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared diary of a person's personal life combining text, video, and pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site in 1994. This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance, and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters.
Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Web sites. However, the evolution of tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger, less technical, population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of "blogging". Blogs can be hosted by dedicated blog hosting services, or they can be run using blog software, or on regular web hosting services.
Some early bloggers, such as The Misanthropic Bitch, who began in 1997, actually referred to their online presence as a zine, before the term blog entered common usage.

===Rise in popularity===

After a slow start, blogging rapidly gained in popularity. Blog usage spread during 1999 and the years following, being further popularized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools:

===Political impact===

An early milestone in the rise in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.[tpl]cite journal | last = Massing | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Massing | title = The News About the Internet | work = New York Review of Books | volume = 56 | issue = 13 | date = 2009-08-13 | pages = 29–32 | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22960 | accessdate = 2009-10-10 | publisher = The New York Review of Books[/tpl] Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story. Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.
Similarly, blogs were among the driving forces behind the "Rathergate" scandal. To wit: (television journalist) Dan Rather presented documents (on the CBS show 60 Minutes) that conflicted with accepted accounts of President Bush's military service record. Bloggers declared the documents to be forgeries and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view. Consequently, CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see Little Green Footballs). Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a news source and opinion and as means of applying political pressure.[tpl]or|date=November 2012[/tpl]
The impact of these stories gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination. Though often seen as partisan gossips,[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead. More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media. Meanwhile, an increasing number of experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis.[tpl]or|date=November 2012[/tpl]
In Russia, some political bloggers have started to challenge the dominance of official, overwhelmingly pro-government media. Bloggers such as Rustem Adagamov and Alexei Navalny have many followers and the latter's nickname for the ruling United Russia party as the "party of crooks and thieves" and been adopted by anti-regime protesters.Daniel Sandford, BBC News: "Russians tire of corruption spectacle", http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15972326 This led to the Wall Street Journal calling Navalny "the man Vladimir Putin fears most" in March 2012.[tpl]cite news |title=The Man Vladimir Putin Fears Most (the weekend interview)  |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203986604577257321601811092.html | author=Matthew Kaminski | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=March 3, 2012 [/tpl]

===Mainstream popularity===

By 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as political consultants, news services, and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming. Blogging was established by politicians and political candidates to express opinions on war and other issues and cemented blogs' role as a news source. (See Howard Dean and Wesley Clark.) Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the UK's Labour Party's MP Tom Watson, began to blog to bond with constituents.
In January 2005, Fortune magazine listed eight bloggers whom business people "could not ignore": Peter Rojas, Xeni Jardin, Ben Trott, Mena Trott, Jonathan Schwartz, Jason Goldman, Robert Scoble, and Jason Calacanis.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fortune.com/fortune/technology/articles/0,15114,1011763-1,00.html | title=Why There's No Escaping the Blog | publisher=Fortune | accessdate=30 January 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050101004415/http://www.fortune.com/fortune/technology/articles/0,15114,1011763-1,00.html | archivedate=1 January 2005 | last1=Kirkpatrick | first1=David | last2=Roth | first2=Daniel[/tpl]
Israel was among the first national governments to set up an official blog.Israel Video Blog aims to show the world 'the beautiful face of real Israel', Ynet, February 24, 2008. Under David Saranga, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs became active in adopting Web 2.0 initiatives, including an official video blog and a political blog.Latest PR venture of Israel's diplomatic mission in New York attracts large Arab audience, Ynet, June 21, 2007. The Foreign Ministry also held a microblogging press conference via Twitter about its war with Hamas, with Saranga answering questions from the public in common text-messaging abbreviations during a live worldwide press conference.Battlefront Twitter[tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl], Haviv Rettig Gur, The Jerusalem Post, December 30, 2008.

Retrieved January 5, 2009.
The impact of blogging upon the mainstream media has also been acknowledged by governments. In 2009, the presence of the American journalism industry had declined to the point that several newspaper corporations were filing for bankruptcy, resulting in less direct competition between newspapers within the same circulation area. Discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government. U.S. President Barack Obama acknowledged the emerging influence of blogging upon society by saying "if the direction of the news is all blogosphere, all opinions, with no serious fact-checking, no serious attempts to put stories in context, then what you will end up getting is people shouting at each other across the void but not a lot of mutual understanding”.Journalists deserve subsidies too, Robert W. McChesney and John Nichols, Delaware Online, November 3, 2009. Retrieved November 10, 2009.

==Types==

There are many different types of blogs, differing not only in the type of content, but also in the way that content is delivered or written.

==Community and cataloging==

==Popularity==

Researchers have actively analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular. There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e., blogroll). The basic conclusion from studies of the structure of blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, permalinks can boost popularity more quickly, and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls, since they denote that people are actually reading the blog's content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.Marlow, C. Audience, structure and authority in the weblog community. Presented at the International Communication Association Conference, May, 2004, New Orleans, LA.
The blogdex project was launched by researchers in the MIT Media Lab to crawl the Web and gather data from thousands of blogs in order to investigate their social properties. Information was gathered by the tool for over four years, during which it autonomously tracked the most contagious information spreading in the blog community, ranking it by recency and popularity. It can therefore[tpl]or|date=September 2012[/tpl] be considered the first instantiation of a memetracker. The project was replaced by tailrank.com which in turn has been replaced by spinn3r.com.
Blogs are given rankings by blog search engine Technorati based on the number of incoming links and Alexa Internet (Web hits of Alexa Toolbar users). In August 2006, Technorati found that the most linked-to blog on the internet was that of Chinese actress Xu Jinglei.Fickling, David, Internet killed the TV star, The Guardian NewsBlog, 15 August 2006 Chinese media Xinhua reported that this blog received more than 50 million page views, claiming it to be the most popular blog in the world.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-08/24/content_672747.htm|title=Xu Jinglei most popular blogger in world|date=2006-08-24|accessdate=2008-06-05|publisher=China Daily[/tpl] Technorati rated Boing Boing to be the most-read group-written blog.

==Blurring with the mass media==

Many bloggers, particularly those engaged in participatory journalism, differentiate themselves from the mainstream media, while others are members of that media working through a different channel. Some institutions see blogging as a means of "getting around the filter" and pushing messages directly to the public. Some critics[tpl]who|date=February 2014[/tpl] worry that bloggers respect neither copyright nor the role of the mass media in presenting society with credible news. Bloggers and other contributors to user-generated content are behind Time magazine naming their 2006 person of the year as "You".
Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs—well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] The first known use of a blog on a news site was in August 1998, when Jonathan Dube of The Charlotte Observer published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.[tpl]cite news|title=Blogging Bonnie.|publisher=Poynter.org|date=2003-09-18 |url=http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&aid=48413/[/tpl]
Some bloggers have moved over to other media. The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: Duncan Black (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), Glenn Reynolds (Instapundit), Markos Moulitsas Zúniga (Daily Kos), Alex Steffen (Worldchanging), Ana Marie Cox (Wonkette), Nate Silver (FiveThirtyEight.com), and Ezra Klein (Ezra Klein blog in The American Prospect, now in the Washington Post). In counterpoint, Hugh Hewitt exemplifies a mass media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in "old media" by being an influential blogger. Similarly, it was Emergency Preparedness and Safety Tips On Air and Online blog articles that captured Surgeon General of the United States Richard Carmona's attention and earned his kudos for the associated broadcasts by talk show host Lisa Tolliver and Westchester Emergency Volunteer Reserves-Medical Reserve Corps Director Marianne Partridge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nsc.org/nsc_events/Nat_Safe_Month/Pages/home.aspx |title=National Safety Month |publisher=Nsc.org |accessdate=2010-04-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/06/21/173419.php|work=Blogcritics|title=Flavor Flav Celebrates National Safety Month|archiveurl=http://archive.is/fpBs|archivedate=2012-07-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://tolliveretips.blogspot.com/2006/06/lisa-tolliver-show-guests-flavor-flav.html|title=Lisa Tolliver show notes|work=Emergency Preparedness and Safety Tips On Air and Online[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://lisatolliver.blogspot.com/2006/05/how-my-radio-shows-publications-and.html|title=Lisa Tolliver's Show Notes|work=Lisa Tolliver On Air and Online[/tpl]
Blogs have also had an influence on minority languages, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in Gaelic languages. Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging.
There are many examples of bloggers who have published books based on their blogs, e.g., Salam Pax, Ellen Simonetti, Jessica Cutler, ScrappleFace. Blog-based books have been given the name blook. A prize for the best blog-based book was initiated in 2005,[tpl]cite news|title=Blooker rewards books from blogs|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4326908.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-10-11|accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl] the Lulu Blooker Prize.[tpl]cite news|title=Blooker prize honours best blogs|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6446271.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-03-17|accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl] However, success has been elusive offline, with many of these books not selling as well as their blogs. Only blogger Tucker Max made The New York Times Best Seller list.[tpl]cite news|last=St |first=Warren |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/fashion/sundaystyles/16CADS.html?ex=1302840000&en=778087aa367d0620&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |title=Dude, here's my book |work=New York Times |date=2006-04-16 |accessdate=2010-07-31[/tpl] The book based on Julie Powell's blog "The Julie/Julia Project" was made into the film Julie & Julia, apparently the first to do so.

==Consumer-generated advertising in blogs==

Consumer-generated advertising is a relatively new and controversial development and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers. Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts.Mutum, Dilip and Wang, Qing (2010). “Consumer Generated Advertising in Blogs”. In Neal M. Burns, Terry Daugherty, Matthew S. Eastin (Eds) Handbook of Research on Digital Media and Advertising: User Generated Content Consumption (Vol 1), IGI Global, 248-261. These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword/s.
Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly themselves. On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, to take advantage of this new development as well.
However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.Techchrunch.com: Payperpost.com offers to sell your soul, Kirkpatrick, M. (2006, June 30).

==Legal and social consequences==

Blogging can result in a range of legal liabilities and other unforeseen consequences.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Search&Key=ETBG/2008/01/25/12/Ar01201.xml&CollName=ET_BANGALORE_ARCHIVE_2007&DOCID=108812&Keyword=%28%3Cmany%3E%3Cstem%3EChandu%3Cand%3E%3Cmany%3E%3Cstem%3EGopalakrishnan%3Cand%3E%3Cmany%3E%3Cstem%3Elibel%3Cand%3E%3Cmany%3E%3Cstem%3Eblog%29&skin=pastissues2&AppName=2&ViewMode=HTML |title=Article Window |publisher=Epaper.timesofindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25[/tpl]

===Defamation or liability===

Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers concerning issues of defamation or liability. U.S. payouts related to blogging totaled $17.4 million by 2009; in some cases these have been covered by umbrella insurance.McQueen MP. (2009). Bloggers, Beware: What You Write Can Get You Sued. WSJ. The courts have returned with mixed verdicts. Internet Service Providers (ISPs), in general, are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties (U.S. Communications Decency Act and the EU Directive 2000/31/EC).
In Doe v. Cahill, the Delaware Supreme Court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the anonymous bloggers, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration.Doe v. Cahill, 884 A.2d 451 (Del. 2005). In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival. The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial.
In January 2007, two prominent Malaysian political bloggers, Jeff Ooi and Ahirudin Attan, were sued by a pro-government newspaper, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan, Hishamuddin bin Aun and Brenden John a/l John Pereira over an alleged defamation. The plaintiff was supported by the Malaysian government. Following the suit, the Malaysian government proposed to "register" all bloggers in Malaysia in order to better control parties against their interest.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21606|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080611025330/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21606|archivedate=2008-06-11|title=Government plans to force bloggers to register|work=Reporters Without Borders|date=2007-04-06|accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl] This is the first such legal case against bloggers in the country.

===Employment===

Employees who blog about elements of their place of employment can begin to affect the brand recognition of their employer. In general, attempts by employee bloggers to protect themselves by maintaining anonymity have proved ineffective.

On the other hand, Penelope Trunk wrote an upbeat article in the Boston Globe back in 2006, entitled "Blogs 'essential' to a good career".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2006/04/16/blogs_essential_to_a_good_career/ |title=Boston.com |publisher=Boston.com |date=2006-04-16 |accessdate=2013-04-21 |first=Penelope |last=Trunk[/tpl] She was one of the first journalists to point out that a large portion of bloggers are professionals and that a well-written blog can help attract employers.

===Political dangers===

Blogging can sometimes have unforeseen consequences in politically sensitive areas. Blogs are much harder to control than broadcast or even print media. As a result, totalitarian and authoritarian regimes often seek to suppress blogs and/or to punish those who maintain them.

===Personal safety===

One consequence of blogging is the possibility of attacks or threats against the blogger, sometimes without apparent reason. Kathy Sierra, author of the innocuous blog "Creating Passionate Users",[tpl]cite web|url=http://headrush.typepad.com/ |title=Headrush.typepad.com |publisher=Headrush.typepad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-21[/tpl] was the target of such vicious threats and misogynistic insults that she canceled her keynote speech at a technology conference in San Diego, fearing for her safety.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-internet31mar31,0,4064392.story?coll=la-home-headlines | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080625081401/http://www.imsafer.com/images/LAtimes_3_31_07.pdf | archivedate=2007-04-02 | title=Abuse, threats quiet bloggers' keyboards|last=Pham | first= Alex |publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2007-03-31|accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl] While a blogger's anonymity is often tenuous, Internet trolls who would attack a blogger with threats or insults can be emboldened by anonymity. Sierra and supporters initiated an online discussion aimed at countering abusive online behavior[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6499095.stm | title=Blog death threats spark debate |publisher=BBC News|date=2007-03-27|accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl] and developed a blogger's code of conduct.

===Behavior===

The Blogger's Code of Conduct is a proposal by Tim O'Reilly for bloggers to enforce civility on their blogs by being civil themselves and moderating comments on their blog.  The code was proposed in 2007 due to threats made to blogger Kathy Sierra.[tpl]cite web|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2007/03/call-for-a-bloggers-code-of-co.html|title=Call for a Blogger's Code of Conduct|publisher=O'Reilly Radar|author=Tim O'Reilly|date=2007-03-03|accessdate=2013-04-26|authorlink=Tim O'Reilly[/tpl] The idea of the code was first reported by BBC News, who quoted O'Reilly saying, "I do think we need some code of conduct around what is acceptable behaviour, I would hope that it doesn't come through any kind of regulation it would come through self-regulation."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6502643.stm|title=Call for blogging code of conduct|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-03-28|accessdate=2007-04-14[/tpl]
O'Reilly and others came up with a list of seven proposed ideas:[tpl]cite web|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2007/04/draft-bloggers-code-of-conduct.html |title=Draft Blogger's Code of Conduct |publisher=Radar.oreilly.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://yankeesailor.blogspot.ca/2005/06/milbloggers-rules-of-engagement.html |title=MilBlogs Rules of Engagement |publisher=http://yankeesailor.blogspot.ca |date=2005-05-20 |accessdate=2013-04-26[/tpl]Code of Conduct: Lessons Learned So Far, by Tim O'Reilly[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blogger.com/content.g |title=Blogger Content Policy |publisher=Blogger.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-30[/tpl]
These ideas were predictably intensely discussed on the Web and in the media. While the internet has continued to grow, with online activity and discourse only picking up both in positive and negative ways in terms of blog interaction, the proposed Code has drawn more widespread attention to the necessity of monitoring blogging activity and social norms being as important online as offline.
