Henry ([tpl]lang-pt|Henrique[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-pt|ẽˈʁik(ɨ)[/tpl]; 31 January 1512 – 31 January 1580) was King of Portugal and the Algarves and Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church. He ruled Portugal between 1578 and 1580.  He was known as Henry the Chaste (Portuguese Henrique o Casto).

==Life==

Born in Lisbon, Henry was the fifth son of King Manuel I of Portugal and Maria of Aragon.

===Cardinal===

Henry was the younger brother of King John III of Portugal and, as a younger son, he was not expected to succeed to the Portuguese throne. Early in his life, Henry took Holy Orders to promote Portuguese interests within the Catholic Church, then dominated by Spain. He rose fast through the Church hierarchy, becoming in quick succession Archbishop of Braga, Archbishop of Évora and Grand Inquisitor before receiving a Cardinal's hat in 1545, along with the Titulus Ss. Quattuor Coronatorum.  From 1564 to 1570 he was Archbishop of Lisbon.  Henry, more than anyone, endeavoured to bring the Jesuits to Portugal and employed them in the colonial empire.

===King===

He served as regent for his grandnephew, King Sebastian, after 1557, and then succeeded him as king after the disastrous Battle of Alcácer Quibir in 1578 in which Sebastian died.  Henry attempted to renounced his clerical offices and sought to take a bride for the continuation of the Avis dynasty, but Pope Gregory XIII, not wanting to anger Philip II, did not release him from his vows.Ruth MacKay, The Baker Who Pretended to Be King of Portugal, (University of Chicago Press, 2012), 44. The Cardinal-King died in Almeirim without having appointed a Council of Regency to choose a successor. One of the closest dynastic claimants was King Philip II of Spain who, in November 1580, sent the Duke of Alba to claim Portugal by force. Lisbon soon fell, and Philip was elected King of Portugal at the Portuguese Cortes of Tomar in 1581, on condition that the kingdom and its overseas territories would not become Spanish provinces.
