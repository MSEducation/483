The Russian Communist Workers' Party of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (RCWP-CPSU) ([tpl]lang-ru| Российская коммунистическая рабочая партия в составе Коммунистическая партия Советского Союза[/tpl]), formerly the Russian Communist Workers' Party – Revolutionary Party of Communists ([tpl]lang-ru|link=no|Российская Коммунистическая Рабочая Партия – Революционная Партия Коммунистов[/tpl], РКРП-РПК) until April 2012, was a registered communist party in Russia (it was formally registered from 2001 to 2007, now unregistered) and it considered as the republican branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (2001).
It was established in October 2001, through the unification of the Russian Communist Workers' Party, the Russian Party of Communists and the Union of Communists, with the aim of resurrecting socialism and the USSR. The RCWP-CPSU considers the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) to be reformist but for the occasion of the 2003 Duma Election the Party leaders decided to make an agreement with the CPRF in order not to disperse the communist vote. 
In 2007, the party was de-registered by the Justice Ministry. In 2010, the RCWP-CPSU co-founded Russian registered political party Russian United Labour Front (ROT Front), led by Viktor Tyulkin.
