The Saadist Institutional Party(Arabic:حزب الهيئة السعدية) is an Egyptian political party. It was established in 1938 as a split-off from the Al Wafd party. Ahmed Maher and Mahmoud Fahmy Elnokrashy were on one side and party secretary Makram Ebeid was on the other. Party head Mustafa el-Nahhas took the side of Makram and dismissed Maher and Elnokrashy.  The dismissed leaders created the new party.
