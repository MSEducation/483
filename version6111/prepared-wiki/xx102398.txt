The 2006 Canadian federal election (more formally, the 39th General Election) was held on January 23, 2006, to elect members  of the Canadian House of Commons of the 39th Parliament of Canada. The Conservative Party of Canada won the greatest number of seats: 40.3% of seats, or 124 out of 308, up from 99 seats in 2004, and 36.3% of votes: up from 29.6% in the 2004 election. The election resulted in a minority government led by the Conservative Party with Stephen Harper becoming the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada.  By proportion of seats, this was Canada's smallest minority government since Confederation.  An investigation by Elections Canada into improper election spending by the Conservative Party became widely known as the In and Out scandal. Despite this it was the longest serving minority government overall.
Voter turnout was 64.7%.[tpl]cite web|last=Pomfret|first=R.|title=Voter Turnout at Federal Elections and Referendums|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=ele&dir=turn&document=index&lang=e|work=Elections Canada Online|publisher=Elections Canada|accessdate= February 10, 2012[/tpl]

==Cause of the election==

This unusual winter general election was caused by a motion of no confidence passed by the House of Commons on November 28, 2005, with Canada's three opposition parties contending that the governing Liberal government of Prime Minister Paul Martin was corrupt.[tpl]cite news|title=Liberal Party Loses Vote Of Confidence In Canada|first=Clifford|last=Krauss|publisher=New York Times|date=November 29, 2005|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E0DB1431F93AA15752C1A9639C8B63[/tpl] The following morning, Prime Minister Paul Martin met Governor General Michaëlle Jean, who then dissolved parliament,[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p2/2005/2005-12-01-x6/pdf/g2-139x6.pdf|journal=Canada Gazette Part II|volume=139|issue=6 Extra|page=1|publisher=Government of Canada|title=Proclamation Dissolving Parliament[/tpl] summoned the next parliament,[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p2/2005/2005-12-01-x6/pdf/g2-139x6.pdf|journal=Canada Gazette Part II|volume=139|issue=6 Extra|page=4|publisher=Government of Canada|title=Proclamation Summoning Parliament to Meet on February 20, 2006[/tpl] and ordered the issuance of writs of election.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p2/2005/2005-12-01-x6/pdf/g2-139x6.pdf|journal=Canada Gazette Part II|volume=139|issue=6 Extra|page=3|publisher=Government of Canada|title=Proclamation Issuing Election Writs[/tpl] The last set January 23, 2006, as election day and February 13 as the date for return of the writs. The campaign was almost eight weeks in length, the longest in two decades, in order to allow time for the Christmas and New Year holidays.
Recent political events, most notably testimony to the Gomery Commission investigating the sponsorship scandal, significantly weakened the Liberals (who, under Martin, had formed the first Liberal minority government since the Trudeau era) by allegations of criminal corruption in the party. The first Gomery report, released November 1, 2005, had found a "culture of entitlement" to exist within the Government. Although the next election was not legally required until 2009, the opposition had enough votes to force the dissolution of Parliament earlier. While Prime Minister Martin had committed in April 2005 to dissolve Parliament within a month of the tabling of the second Gomery Report (which was released on schedule on February 1, 2006), all three opposition parties—the Conservatives, Bloc Québécois, and New Democratic Party (NDP) — and three of the four independents decided that the issue at hand was how to correct the Liberal corruption, and the motion of non-confidence passed 171-133.
