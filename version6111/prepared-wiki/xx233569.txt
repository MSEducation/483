[[Great Debates (international relations)]]

CATEGORIES: International relations theory, Debates, Political realism

In international relations theory, the Great Debates refer to a series of disagreements between international relations scholars.Ken Booth, Michael Cox, Timothy Dunne,The eighty years' crisis: international relations 1919-1999, Issue 1, p1: "The story of international relations is conveniently told in a series of 'great debates'.  Ashworth describes how the discipline of international relations has been heavily influenced by historical narratives and that "no single idea has been more influential" than the notion that there was a debate between utopian and realist thinking.LM Ashworth, Did the Realist-Idealist Great Debate Really Happen? a Revisionist History of International Relations,International Relations, Vol. 16, No. 1, p31 (2002)

==First Great Debate==

The "First Great Debate" also known as the "Realist-Idealist Great Debate"LM Ashworth, Did the Realist-Idealist Great Debate Really Happen? a Revisionist History of International Relations,International Relations, Vol. 16, No. 1, 33-51 (2002) was a dispute between idealists and realists which took place in the 1930s and 1940sKen Booth, Michael Cox, Timothy Dunne,The eighty years' crisis: international relations 1919-1999, Issue 1, p1 and which was fundamentally about how to deal with Nazi Germany.[ref]Richard Devetak, Anthony Burke, Jim George (2007) An Introduction to International Relations: Australian Perspectives, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 90
[/ref] Realist scholars emphasized the anarchical nature of international politics and the need for state survival. Idealists emphasized the possibility of international institutions such as the League of Nations. However, some have argued that defining the debate between realism and idealism in terms of a great debate is a misleading caricature and so described the "great debate" as a myth.Vigneswaran, Darsha, International relations’ first great debate : context and tradition.ISBN 0 7315 3133 7, p5Peter Wilson (1998). The myth of the ‘First Great Debate’. Review of International Studies, 24 , pp 1-16

==Second Great Debate==

The "Second Great Debate" was a dispute between "scientific IR" scholars who sought to refine scientific methods of inquiry in international relations theory and those who insisted on a more historicist/interpretative approach to international relations theory. The debate is termed "realists versus behaviourists" or "traditionalism versus scientism". Guzzini, Stefano (1998) Realism in international relations and international political economy: the continuing story of a death foretold, New York: Routledge, P. 32

==Inter-paradigm Debate==

Sometimes the inter-paradigm debate is considered to be a great debate and is therefore referred to as the "Third Great Debate". The inter-paradigm debate was a debate between liberalism, realism and radical international relations theories.Weaver, Ole,The rise and all of the Inter-paradigm debate, International theory: positivism and beyond, Steve Smith, Ken Booth, Marysia Zalewski, p151 The debate has also been described as being between realism, institutionalism and structuralism.http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/9/4/3/p179436_index.html

==Fourth Great Debate==

The "Fourth Great Debate" was a debate between positivist theories and post-positivist theories of international relations. Confusingly, it is often described in literature as "The Third Great Debate" by those who reject the description of the inter-paradigm debate as a Great Debate.Y Lapid, The third debate: On the prospects of international theory in a post-positivist era, International Studies Quarterly (1989) 33, 235-254 This debate is concerned with the underlying epistemology of international relations scholarship and is also described as a debate between "rationalists" and "reflectivists".Smith, Steve (2007) "Introduction" in  T. Dunne. M. Kuki, and S. Smith (eds.) International Relations Theories: Discipline and Diversity. Oxford: Oxford University Press. P. 10 The debate was started by Robert Keohane in an International Studies Association debate in 1988 and can be considered an epistemological debate, about how we can know 'things' rather than an ontological one,Smith, S, (2007) 'Introduction'  in Dunne, T., Kuki, M. and Smith, S (eds.) ''International Relations Theories: Discipline and Diversity Oxford: OUP, p 5 that is to say a debate about what we can claim to know.

==Fifth Great Debate?==

Brown remarking on the possibility of a "Fifth Great Debate" has suggested that the debate could concern critical realism but goes on to say 'let us hope not, because the first four great debates were singularly pointless affairs, and the fifth, when it arrives, is unlikely to be any different. Brown, C. (2007) Situating Critical Realism, Millennium - Journal of International Studies, 35/2: 409-16 Steve Smith argues that 'it is difficult to find any notion of a "fifth great debate" in the literature. Smith, S. (2008) The Oxford Handbook of International Relations, C. Reus-Smit, D. Snidal (eds.),Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 726

==Criticism==

Steve Smith has argued that the differing positions have largely ignored each other meaning that it makes little sense to talk of 'debates' between rival theoretical frameworks. Smith, S. (2008) The Oxford Handbook of International Relations, C. Reus-Smit, D. Snidal (eds.),Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 726
