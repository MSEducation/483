==Career==

When she was 15, Jade's mother entered her into a modeling competition on the UK TV show 'This Morning', in which she won and was awarded with a contract with MODELS1.
Jade's runway debut was for the Prada Spring 1995 show in Milan in October, 1994.  The show featured many of the industry's top models of the time including Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Nadja Auermann, Brandi Quinones and Kirsty Hume.  She was also booked for shows in Paris including Ann Demeulemeester.
Jade was among the crop of British models that stormed onto the scene at the tail-end of the Kate Moss/waif debacle in the mid-90s', along with Carolyn Park, Stella Tennant, Jaquetta Wheeler and Jodie Kidd, another 6-foot-plus Brit.  
Designers took advantage of her extremely tall, exaggerated frame and soon, she was walking the runways for the elite of designers and fashion houses, such as Karl Lagerfeld, for both his line and later Chanel, Jean-Paul Gaultier, John Galliano and also Galliano for Christian Dior, Thierry Mugler and the late Alexander McQueen, for both McQueen's own line and when he was under the helm at Givenchy. 
Jade became a show staple for Galliano, McQueen and Jean-Paul Gaultier, even later into her runway career in the early 2000s.

Jade has a son, Jackson, who was born in 2007.
