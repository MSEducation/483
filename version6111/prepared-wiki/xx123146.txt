[[A5025 road]]

CATEGORIES: Roads in Wales, Transport in Anglesey

The A5025 is a British 'A' road that runs from Llanfairpwllgwyngyll to Valley in Anglesey, Wales. It runs up the east, north and finally north-west side of the island via several places including Benllech and Amlwch. In all the road is around [tpl]convert|33|mi|km[/tpl] long. Due to the road being one of the larger roads on the island (along with the A5 and the A55) it is a major bus route around the island.
When it was first numbered in 1922 the road was extremely short, being just one street in the town of Porthaethwy. Later that decade however it was extended (or other roads were upgraded) to Amlwch and then to its current route. There is a webpage dedicated to telling motorists the locations of special tarmaced areas alongside the road created for police mobile speed cameras.
