Haryana name was probably derived from the Great Rana HarRai, a great General of Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan, who settled down along with the folks from his clan in the plains of present day Haryana and therefore was the largest and the most powerful occupant of present day Haryana . He is also popularly known as Rana Harraa

===Ancient period===

Haryana was the outermost location of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization with centers such as Banawali and Rakhigarhi. The most extensive center, Rakhigarhi, is now a village in Hisar District. The site is dated to be over 5,000 years old. Evidence of paved roads, drainage system, large rainwater collection, storage system, terracotta brick, statue production, and skilled metal working (in both bronze and precious metals) has been uncovered.
Also the Vedic Civilization flourished on the banks of the now lost Sarasvati River. Several decisive battles were fought in the area, which shaped much of the history of India. These include the epic Battle of Kurukshetra described in the Mahabharata (including the recital of the Bhagavad Gita by Krishna) and the three battles of Panipat.

===Medieval period===

King Harshavardhana established his capital at Thanesar near Kurukshetra in the 7th century AD. After his death, the kingdom of his clansmen continued to rule over a vast region for quite a while from Harsha's adopted capital of Kannauj. The region remained strategically important for the rulers of North India even though Thanesar was no more central than Kannauj. Prithviraj Chauhan established forts at Tarori and Hansi in the 12th century. Muhammad Ghori conquered this area in the Second Battle of Tarain. Following his death, the Delhi Sultanate was established that ruled much of north India for several centuries. The earliest reference to 'Ahirana' from Ahirs means "Fearless" occurs in a Sanskrit inscription dated 1328 AD kept in Delhi Museum, which refers to this region as The heaven on earth, indicating that it was fertile and relatively peaceful at that time. Firoz Shah Tughlaq established a fort at Hisar in 1354 to further fortify the region, and also constructed canals or rajwahas as they were referred to in the Indo-Persian historical texts.
The three famous battles of Panipat took place near the modern town of Panipat in Haryana. The first battle took place in 1526, where Babur, the ruler of Kabul, defeated Ibrahim Lodi of the Delhi Sultanate, through the use of field artillery.

===Rise of Hemu as a Vikramaditya king===

Hemu, son of a Purohit Family living in Rewari in south Haryana, started his career as a supplier of merchandise especially, Cannons and Gun Powder to Sher Shah Suri's army, during the 1540s. Gradually, Hemu progressed and held various positions in Suri administration during Sher Shah's son, Islam Shah's regime during 1546–1553, and rose to become Prime Minister and General of Suri army under Adil Shah. During 1553–56, ruling as de facto king of North India, Hemu won 22 battles continuously against Afghan rebels and Mughal forces from Punjab to Bengal without losing any to consolidate his empire. After defeating Akbar's army at Agra and Delhi in Battle for Delhi (1556), Hem Chandra acceeded to the throne of Delhi on 7 October 1556, declaring 'Hindu Raj' in north India and himself as a Vikramaditya king on the pattern of earlier Vedic kings in India. Hemu lost his life in the second battle of Panipat on November the 5th, 1556, when Akbar's forces defeated, this local Haryanvi warrior rightly called Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya.
The decline of the Mughal Empire in early 18th century, led to rapid territorial gains for the Maratha Empire, including Haryana. In 1737, Maratha forces sacked Delhi, following their victory against the Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi. A treaty signed in 1752 made Marathas the protector of the Mughal throne at Delhi.[ref]
