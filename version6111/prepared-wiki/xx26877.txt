The grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi) is a subtropical citrus tree known for its sour  to semi-sweet fruit, an 18th-century hybrid first bred in Barbados.[tpl]cite book |last1=Carrington |first1=Sean |last2=Fraser |first2=HenryC |title=A~Z of Barbados Heritage |accessdate=6 April 2010 |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2003 |origyear= |publisher=Macmillan Caribbean |location= |isbn=0-333-92068-6 |pages=90–91 |chapter=Grapefruit |quote=One of many citrus species grown in Barbados.

==Description==

The evergreen grapefruit trees usually grow to around [tpl]convert|5|–|6|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl] tall, although they can reach [tpl]convert|13|–|15|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl]. The leaves are glossy dark green, long (up to [tpl]convert|15|cm|in|sp=us[/tpl]) and thin. It produces [tpl]convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl] white four-petaled flowers. The fruit is yellow-orange skinned and generally an oblate spheroid in shape; it ranges in diameter from [tpl]convert|10|–|15|cm|in|sp=us[/tpl]. The flesh is segmented and acidic, varying in color depending on the cultivars, which include white, pink and red pulps of varying sweetness (generally, the redder varieties are sweeter). The 1929 US Ruby Red (of the Redblush variety) has the first grapefruit patent.Texas grapefruit history, TexaSweet. Retrieved 2 July 2008.

==History==

One ancestor of the grapefruit was the Jamaican sweet orange (Citrus sinensis), itself an ancient hybrid of Asian origin; the other was the Indonesian pomelo (C. maxima). One story of the fruit's origins is that a certain "Captain Shaddock"A possible identification with an actual Captain Chaddock who traded in the West Indies in the 17th century, was suggested by J. Kumamoto, R. W. Scora, H. W. Lawton and W. A. Clerx, "Mystery of the forbidden fruit: Historical epilogue on the origin of the grapefruit, Citrus paradisi (Rutaceae)", Economic Botany, 41.1 (January, 1987:97-107). brought pomelo seeds to Jamaica and bred the first fruit.Grapefruit: a fruit with a bit of a complex in Art Culinaire (Winter, 2007)  However, it probably originated as a naturally occurring hybrid.

The hybrid fruit, then called "the forbidden fruit", was first documented in 1750 by a Welshman, Rev. Griffith Hughes, who described specimens from Barbados in The Natural History of Barbados.World Wide Words: Questions & Answers; Grapefruit.

Hence the name "Welchman Hall" gully. It was this man who first developed the gully with exotic trees and an orchard. Interestingly, the grapefruit is originally from Barbados and is rumoured to have started in Welchman Hall Gully.  |ref= |separator= |postscript= [/tpl] Currently, the grapefruit is said to be one of the "Seven Wonders of Barbados."Barbados Seven Wonders: The Grapefruit Tree. Abstract
The grapefruit was brought to Florida by Count Odet Philippe in 1823 in what is now known as Safety Harbor. Further crosses have produced the tangelo (1905), the Minneola tangelo (1931), and the oroblanco (1984).
The grapefruit was known as the shaddock or shattuck until the 19th century. Its current name alludes to clusters of the fruit on the tree, which often appear similar to grapes."How did the grapefruit get its name?" Library of Congress. Science Reference Service, Everyday Mysteries. Retrieved August 2, 2009. Botanically, it was not distinguished from the pomelo until the 1830s, when it was given the name Citrus paradisi. Its true origins were not determined until the 1940s. This led to the official name being altered to Citrus × paradisi, the "×" identifying its hybrid origin.Texas Citrus: Puzzling Beginnings.

An early pioneer in the American citrus industry was Kimball Chase Atwood, a wealthy entrepreneur who founded the Atwood Grapefruit Co. in the late 19th century. The Atwood Grove became the largest grapefruit grove in the world, with a yearly output of 80,000 boxes of fruit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20040816/NEWS/408160323?tc=ar |title=Manatee County a big part of citrus history |publisher=HeraldTribune.com |date=2004-08-16 |accessdate=2011-12-17[/tpl] It was there that pink grapefruit was first discovered in 1906.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/grapefruit.html |title=Article |publisher=Hort.purdue.edu |accessdate=2011-12-17[/tpl]

===Ruby Red===

The 1929 Ruby Red patent was associated with real commercial success, which came after the discovery of a red grapefruit growing on a pink variety. The Red grapefruit, starting with the Ruby Red, has even become a symbolic fruit of Texas, where white "inferior" grapefruit were eliminated and only red grapefruit were grown for decades.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] Using radiation to trigger mutations, new varieties were developed to retain the red tones which typically faded to pink,[tpl]cite news |author=William J Broad |title=Useful Mutants, Bred With Radiation |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/28/science/28crop.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin |work=New York Times |date=28 August 2007 [/tpl] the Rio Red variety is the current (2007) Texas grapefruit with registered trademarks Rio Star and Ruby-Sweet, also sometimes promoted as "Reddest" and "Texas Choice". The Rio Red is a mutation bred variety which was developed by treatment of bud sticks with thermal neutrons. Its improved attributes of mutant variety are fruit and juice color, deeper red, and wide adaptation.

===Star Ruby===

The Star Ruby is the darkest of the red varieties. Developed from an irradiated Hudson grapefruit, it has found limited commercial success because it is more difficult to grow than other varieties.[tpl]cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/citrus/grapefruit.htm|title=Home fruit Production-Grapefruit|last=Sauls|first=Julian W.|year=1998|accessdate=2013-07-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.citrusvariety.ucr.edu/citrus/starruby.html|title=Star Ruby grapefruit|author=Center for Visual Computing|accessdate=2013-07-22[/tpl]

==Varieties==

The primary varieties of Texas and Florida grapefruit are Ruby Red, Pink, Thompson, Marsh and Duncan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gofloridagrapefruit.com/florida-grown/ |title=Go Florida Grapefruit |publisher=Go Florida Grapefruit |accessdate=2011-12-17[/tpl]

==Production==

The United States is the top producer of grapefruit and pomelo followed by China and South Africa.

==Colors and flavors==

Grapefruit comes in many varieties, determinable by color, which is caused by the pigmentation of the fruit in respect of its state of ripeness.  The most popular varieties cultivated today are red, white, and pink hues, referring to the internal pulp color of the fruit. The family of flavors range from highly acidic and somewhat sour to sweet and tart.  Grapefruit mercaptan, a sulfur-containing terpene, is one of the substances which has a strong influence on the taste and odor of grapefruit, compared with other citrus fruits.

==Drug interactions==

Grapefruit can have a number of interactions with drugs,[tpl]vcite journal |author=Seden K. Dickinson L. Khoo S. Back D. |title=Grapefruit-drug interactions. Review |journal=Drugs |volume=70 |issue=18 |pages=2373-407 |year=2010 |month=Dec 24 |doi= |pmid=21142260 [/tpl] often increasing the effective potency of compounds. Researchers have identified 85 drugs with which grapefruit is known to have an adverse reaction.[tpl]cite news|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/grapefruit-is-a-culprit-in-more-drug-reactions/|title=Grapefruit Is a Culprit in More Drug Reactions|publisher=New York Times|date=December 17, 2012|first=Roni Caryn|last=Rabin[/tpl] Grapefruit contains a number of polyphenolic compounds, including the flavanone naringin, alongside the two furanocoumarins bergamottin and dihydroxybergamottin. These inhibit the drug-metabolizing enzyme isoform CYP3A4 predominantly in the small intestine, but at higher doses also inhibit hepatic CYP3A4.[tpl]vcite journal |author=Veronese ML, Gillen LP, Burke JP, Dorval EP, Hauck WW, Pequignot E, Waldman SA, Greenberg HE |title=Exposure-dependent inhibition of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 in vivo by grapefruit juice |journal=Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |year=2003 |month=Aug |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=831–9 |doi=10.1177/0091270003256059 |pmid=12953340 [/tpl] It is via inhibition of this enzyme that grapefruit increases the effects of a variety of drugs by increasing their bioavailability.[tpl]cite journal |author=He K, Iyer KR, Hayes RN, Sinz MW, Woolf TF, Hollenberg PF |title=Inactivation of cytochrome P450 3A4 by bergamottin, a component of grapefruit juice |journal=Chem.

When drugs are taken orally, they enter the gut lumen to be absorbed in the small intestine and sometimes, in the stomach. In order for drugs to be absorbed, they must pass through the epithelial cells that line the lumen wall before they can enter the hepatic portal circulation to be distributed systemically in blood circulation. Drugs are metabolized by drug-specific metabolizing enzymes in the epithelial cells. Metabolizing enzymes transform these drugs into metabolites. The primary purpose for drug metabolism is to detoxify, inactivate, solubilize and eliminate these drugs.Pandit Introduction to Pharmaceutical Sciences As a result, the amount of the drug in its original form that reaches systemic circulation is reduced due to this first-pass metabolism.
Grapefruit juice contains furanocoumarins. Furanocoumarins irreversibly inhibit a cytochrome P450 metabolizing enzyme called CYP3A4, as stated above. CYP3A4 is a metabolizing enzyme for almost 50% of drugs, and is found in the liver and small intestinal epithelial cells.Pirmohamed Drug-grapefruit juice interactions BMJ 2013;346:f1 As a result, many drugs are impacted by consumption of grapefruit juice. When the metabolizing enzyme is inhibited, less of the drug will be metabolized by it in the epithelial cells. A decrease in drug metabolism means more of the original form of the drug could pass unchanged to systemic blood circulation. An unexpected high dose of the drug in the blood could lead to fatal drug toxicity.
The furanocoumarins found in grapefruit juice are natural chemicals. Thus, they are present in all forms of the fruit, including freshly squeezed juice, frozen concentrate, and whole fruit. All these forms of the grapefruit juice have the potential to limit the metabolizing activity of CYP3A4. One whole grapefruit, or a glass of 200 mL of grapefruit juice can cause drug overdose toxicity.Bailey, David G.; Dresser, George; Arnold, J. Malcolm O. (2012). "Grapefruit-medication interactions: Forbidden fruit or avoidable consequences?". Canadian Medical Association Journal (Canadian Medical Association). [tpl]DOI|10.1503/cmaj.120951[/tpl]
According to a review done by the Canadian Medical Association, there is an increase in the number of potential drugs that can interact with grapefruit juice. From 2008 to 2012, the percentage of drugs that interact with grapefruit juice and causes serious harmful effects (gastrointestinal bleeding, nephrotoxicity) has increased from 17 to 43 percent.
The interaction between grapefruit juice and other medication depends on the drug, and not the class of the drug. Drugs that interact with grapefruit juice share 3 common features: they are taken orally, normally only a small amount enters systemic blood circulation, and they are metabolized by CYP3A4.
Inhibition of the CPA 3A4 enzyme is irreversible and lasts a significant period of time. It takes around 24 hours to regain 50% of the enzyme activity and it can take 72 hours for the enzyme to completely return to activity. For this reason, simply separating grapefruit consumption and medication taken daily does not avoid the interaction.BMJ 2013;346:f1http://pharmacistanswers.com/grapefruit-juice-drug-interactions.htmlGreenblatt DJ, Patki KC, von Moltke LL, Shader RI. Drug interactions with grapefruit juice: an update. J Clin Psychopharmacol 2001;21:357-9.Greenblatt DJ, von Moltke LL, Harmatz JS, et al. Time course of recovery of cytochrome P450 3A function after single doses of grapefruit juice. Clin Pharmacol Ther 2003;75:121-9. For medications that interact due to inhibition of OATP (organic anion-transporting polypeptides), a relative short period of time is needed to avoid this interaction. A 4-hour interval between grapefruit consumption and the medication should suffice. For drugs recently sold on the market, drugs have information pages (monographs) that provide information on any potential interaction between a medication and grapefruit juice. Because there is a growing number of medications that are known to interact with grapefruit juice, patients should consult a pharmacist or physician before planning to take grapefruit juice with their medications.
Grapefruit juice may be the first drug-interacting fruit juice documented, but apple and orange juices have been also implicated in interfering with etoposide, a chemotherapy drug, some beta blocker drugs used to treat high blood pressure, and cyclosporine, taken by transplant patients to prevent rejection of their new organs.[tpl]cite news |title=Fruit juice 'could affect drugs'  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7572500.stm |work=BBC News |date=20 August 2008 [/tpl] :]  Some citrus-based carbonated beverages (e.g., “Sun Drop”) also contain enough grapefruit juice to cause drug interactions, particularly in patients taking cyclosporine.
Unlike other fruits, grapefruit contains a large amount of naringin, and it can take up to 72 hours before the effects of the naringin on the CYP3A4 enzyme are seen. This is particularly problematic due to the fact that only 4 oz of grapefruit contain enough naringin to inhibit the metabolism of substrates of CYP3A4.

Since grapefruit juice is known to inhibit enzymes necessary for the clearance of some drugs and hormones, some have hypothesized that grapefruit juice may play an indirect role in the development of hormone-dependent cancers.

There is a popular myth that grapefruits contain high amounts of spermidine, a simple polyamine that may be related to aging. The myth probably relies on the confusion between spermidine and putrescine. While citrus fruits show high amounts of putrescine, they contain very little spermidine.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.3402/fnr.v55i0.5572 | title = Polyamines in foods: development of a food database | year = 2011 | last1 = Ali | first1 = Mohamed Atiya | last2 = Poortvliet | first2 = Eric | last3 = Strömberg | first3 = Roger | last4 = Yngve | first4 = Agneta | journal = Food Nutr Res. | volume = 55 | pages = 5572 | pmid = 21249159[/tpl]

==Grapefruit sweets==

In Costa Rica, especially in Atenas, grapefruit are often cooked to remove their sourness, rendering them as sweets; they are also stuffed with dulce de leche, resulting in a dessert called toronja rellena (stuffed grapefruit).  In Haiti, grapefruit is used primarily for its juice (jus de Chadèque), but is also used to make jam (confiture de Chadèque).[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Other uses==

Grapefruit has also been investigated in cancer medicine pharmacodynamics. Its inhibiting effect on the metabolism of some drugs may allow smaller doses to be used, which can help to reduce costs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/560026 |author=Gandey A |title=Cut Cancer Drug Costs By Exploring Food Interactions |work=Medscape Medical News |date=18 July 2007[/tpl]
