==Early life and education==

Ruby Amanfu was born in Accra, Ghana to a musical family of five. When she was three years old, her father moved the family to Nashville, TN, where early on she began to flourish around the sights and sounds of Music City. She started writing songs at a young age and entered a school talent show in third grade where she took home the first place prize: a pack of 10 gumballs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.afrikangoddess.com/rubyamanfu.htm |title=Ruby Amanfu - Afrikan Goddess (AG) Online |publisher=Afrikan Goddess |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07[/tpl]
More talent shows followed, as well as a knack for literary competitions wherein she discovered her passion for writing song lyrics. She was educated in the private and magnet school systems and attended high school at the prestigious Hume-Fogg Academic Magnet High School, whose premiere Fine Arts program afforded her the opportunity to write and record songs in the school’s studio. In her sophomore year of high school, Amanfu was chosen for The Nashville Symphony Chorus, becoming the youngest member of the group at age 15.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/entertainment/photo.day.php?ID=34097 |title=GhanaWeb |publisher=GhanaWeb |date= |accessdate=2011-10-16[/tpl] She performed with the group for one season.

==Career==

In her junior year of high school, Amanfu was introduced by a classmate to a local philanthropic couple, Dave and Becky Matthews. The Matthews’ took interest in Amanfu’s songwriting and offered to fund her first full-length album, So Now The Whole World Knows, with Dave at the helm as engineer and co-producer with Amanfu. The LP was recorded at The Matthews’ well-appointed home studio during her junior and senior years. She attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts and transferred to Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee when music critics such as Robert K. Oermann began to praise Amanfu’s debut. Once Amanfu returned to Nashville to promote So Now The Whole World Knows, she signed to independent record label Spongebath Records in 1999. She began working with Grammy nominated singer/songwriter, Tommy Sims, co-author of Eric Clapton’s Change the World. Sims produced and co-wrote Amanfu’s song, “Sugah.” 
Amanfu was being courted by record labels across the country in 2001 when the prestigious UK A&R publication, The Tip Sheet, named Amanfu’s song “Sugah” as their "Tip of the Week." UK record label Polydor Records and Scandinavian music house Murlyn Music Group both became interested in "Sugah" and signed her to a co-venture between their companies as well as Interscope Records in the U.S. Amanfu’s album, Smoke & Honey (Polydor 2003) and its single, “Sugah,”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Ruby+Amanfu |title=Ruby Amanfu – Discover music, videos, concerts, stats, & pictures at |publisher=Last.fm |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2011-10-16[/tpl] reached #3 on the Billboard Pop Airplay Charts and #52 on the Austrian Charts.[tpl]cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://www.austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Ruby+Amanfu&titel=Sugah&cat=s |title=Ruby Amanfu - Sugah |publisher=austriancharts.at |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21[/tpl]
Amanfu asked out of the co-venture in late 2003 after the companies faced problems, causing her album’s promotion to be halted in its prime. She was released from the record deal by year’s end.
