The text is divided according to the [tpl]lang|grc|κεφαλαια[/tpl] (chapters), whose numbers are given at the margin, with their [tpl]lang|grc|τιτλοι[/tpl] (titles) at the top and foot of the pages. There is also a division according to the smaller Ammonian Sections, with references to the Eusebian Canons (only partially). The τιτλοι and numbers of the [tpl]lang|grc|κεφαλαια[/tpl] are red in Matthew and black in Mark. The Ammonian Sections are red in Matthew, in Mark are often black. The references to the Eusebian Canons are mostly omitted.Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener, Adversaria Critica Sacra: With a Short Explanatory Introduction (Cambridge, 1893), pp. XLVII-XLIX.
It contains lists of the [tpl]lang|grc|κεφαλαια[/tpl] (list of contents) before each Gospel, lectionary markings at the margin (for liturgical use), subscriptions at the end of each Gospel (with numbers of [tpl]lang|grc|στιχοι[/tpl]).[ref]

There are many abridgements in the writing. The rubrical directions in margin are both in black and red. Some corrections seem to be written by prima manu others plainly secondary manu (Matthew 20,13.20; 21,42; 27,64; Mark 1:22; 5:19; 6:15; 10:32; 11:3).
According tο Scrivener, [tpl]lang|grc|N εφελκυστικον[/tpl] occurs only seven times, a hiatus for the lack of it thrice."Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener, Adversaria Critica Sacra: With a Short Explanatory Introduction (Cambridge, 1893), p. XLVIII. There are unusual number of iotacistic errors (115 occurrences): [tpl]lang|grc|ι[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|grc|η[/tpl], [tpl]lang|grc|η[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|grc|ι[/tpl], [tpl]lang|grc|ο[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|grc|ω[/tpl], [tpl]lang|grc|ω[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|grc|ο, η[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|grc|ει[/tpl], [tpl]lang|grc|ει[/tpl] for η, [tpl]lang|grc|ε[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|grc|αι, αι[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|grc|ε, ι[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|grc|ει[/tpl] (only 1), [tpl]lang|grc|ει[/tpl] for ι, ε for η (only 1), [tpl]lang|grc|ου[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|grc|ω[/tpl], ω for ου, υ for ι, οι for ι, [tpl]lang|grc|ει[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|grc|οι[/tpl] (only 1), [tpl]lang|grc|συ[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|grc|σοι[/tpl] (2), [tpl]lang|grc|η[/tpl] for [tpl]lang|grc|υ[/tpl].Another manuscript with unusual number of itacistic errors is Minuscule 543.
There are many omissions by homoioteleuton (Matthew 21:32; 22:2.3; 23:3.12; Mark 2:22; 4:24; 7:20; 8:11.37; 9:5; 10:19.32; 11:15.28).

==History==

The manuscript is dated, probably by the first hand, to the year 1323, but dated by paleographers to the 15th century.[tpl]r|Aland[/tpl]
In 1864 the manuscript was purchased from a dealer at Janina in Epeiros, by Baroness Burdett-Coutts (1814–1906), a philanthropist,[tpl]Cite book |last=Parker|first=Franklin |title=George Peabody, a biography |publisher=Vanderbilt University Press |year=1995 |pages=107 |url=http://books.google.pl/books?hl=pl&id=OPIbk-ZPnF4C&q=Burdett-Coutts#v=snippet&q=Burdett-Coutts&f=false[/tpl] together with other Greek manuscripts (among them codices 532-546). They were transported to England in 1870-1871.Robert Mathiesen, An Important Greek Manuscript Rediscovered and Redated (Codex Burdett-Coutts III.42), The Harvard Theological Review, Vol. 76, No. 1 (Jan., 1983), pp. 131-133.
The manuscript was presented by Burdett-Coutts to Sir Roger Cholmely's School, and was housed at the Highgate (Burdett-Coutts II. 26. 2), in London. It was examined and collated by Scrivener in his Adversaria critica sacra (1893).F. H. A. Scrivener, Adversaria critica sacra (Cambridge, 1893).
It was added to the list of the New Testament manuscripts by F. H. A. Scrivener and C. R. Gregory. Gregory saw it in 1883.[tpl]r|Gregory[/tpl]
In 1922 it was acquired for the University of Michigan.Kenneth W. Clark, A Descriptive Catalogue of Greek New Testament Manuscripts in America (Chicago, 1937), p. 294. The manuscript was digitalized by the CSNTM in 2008. Images of the minuscule 541 at the CSNTM
It is currently housed at the University of Michigan (Ms. Inv. No. 23b) in Ann Arbor.[tpl]r|Aland[/tpl]
