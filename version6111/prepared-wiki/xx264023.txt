[[Cyberstalking legislation]]

CATEGORIES: Cyber-bullying, Privacy law, Computer law

Cyberstalking and cyberbullying are relatively new phenomena, but that does not mean that crimes committed through the network are not punishable under legislation drafted for that purpose. Although there are often existing laws that prohibit stalking or harassment in a general sense, legislators sometimes believe that such laws are inadequate or do not go far enough, and thus bring forward new legislation to address this perceived shortcoming. In the United States, for example, nearly every state has laws that address cyberstalking, cyberbullying, or both.http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=13495

==Issues at stake==

Cyberbullying and cyberstalking, by their nature, define adversarial relationships. One person (or group), the provocateur, is exerting a view or opinion that the other person (or group), the target, finds offensive, hurtful, or damaging in some way. In a general sense, it would seem simple to legislate this type of behavior; slander and libel laws exist to tackle these situations. However, just as with slander and libel, it is important to balance the protection of freedom of speech of both parties with the need for protection of the target. Thus, something that may be deemed cyberbullying at first glance may, in fact, be more akin to something like parody or similar.
A 2006 National Crime Prevention Council survey found that some 40% of teens had experienced cyberbullying at some point in their lives, making the problem particularly widespread.http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/on-education/2009/01/07/california-law-targets-cyberbullying

==Legislation by country==

===United States===

===="Cyberbullying" versus "cyberstalking"====

In the US, in practice, there is little legislative difference between the concepts of "cyberbullying" and "cyberstalking." The primary distinction is one of age; if adults are involved, the act is usually termed cyberstalking, while among children it is usually referred to as cyberbullying. However, this distinction is one of semantics, and many laws treat bullying and stalking as much the same issue.

====Freedom of speech issues====

First Amendment concerns often arise when questionable speech is uttered or posted online. This is equally true when dealing with cyberbullying. Particularly in instances where there are no laws explicitly against cyberbullying, it is not uncommon for defendants to argue that their conduct amounts to an exercise of their freedom of speech.
The courts have variously come down on either side of that debate, even within the same state. For example, a student in California who was suspended from school based on cyberbullying claims took the school district to court, citing a breach of her First Amendment rights; the court agreed with the student and found the school district had overstepped its authority.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/12/14/judge_rules_students_cruel_remarks_online_are_not_unconstitutional/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Victoria | last=Kim | title=Judge backs student's First Amendment rights | date=14 December 2009[/tpl] In another California case, in which a student was harassed after posting personal information online, the court found that threatening posts were not protected speech.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/cyberbullying-not-protected/ | work=Wired | first=Kim | last=Zetter | title=Court: Cyberbullying Threats Are Not Protected Speech | date=18 March 2010[/tpl]
That said, true threats are not considered to be protected speech.http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2007/02/8903.ars
Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have taken the view that cyberbullying is an overly expansive term, and that the First Amendment protects all speech, even the reprehensible; this protection would extend to the Internet.http://www.aclu.org/2008/01/16/free-speech-and-cyber-bullying
In general, such organizations argue that while the need for legislation against cyberbullying may exist, legislators must take a cautious, reasoned approach to enacting laws, and not rush into creating laws that would curtail speech too much.http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2010/01/12/first-amendment-and-cyber-bullying/
Internet free speech issues have certainly made their way through the court systems, even as far back as cases from the mid-90s. In the case of United States v. Baker, for example, an undergraduate at the University of Michigan was charged with crimes related to snuff stories he had posted on Internet newsgroups, stories that named one of his fellow students. After progressing through the courts, the charges against Baker were dismissed primarily on grounds that there was no evidence that Baker would actually act out the fantasies contained in those stories. This case is now considered a landmark in the realm of First Amendment issues on the Internet.http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/ilaw/Speech/Baker1.html

====The need for new laws====

The focus on legislating cyberbullying and cyberstalking has largely come about as a result of the perceived inadequacy, generally by legislators and parents of bullying victims, of existing laws, whether those existing laws cover stalking, unauthorized use of computer resources, or the like.
The motivation behind the bill in 1990 where 50 U.S. states and the federal government passed a bill to "criminalize" stalking was due to the cases of stalking against celebrities (Spitzberg & Hoobler, 2002).
For example, in the case of United States v. Lori Drew, in which Megan Meier had committed suicide after being bullied on MySpace, three of the four charges against the defendant (Drew) were actually in response to alleged violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, since specific statues against cyberbullying were not on the books. The jury eventually found Drew innocent of the charges (but guilty of a misdemeanor), a verdict that was later set aside by the judge. In this situation, legislators in Missouri, at the urging of the public and Meier's parents, passed "Megan's Law",http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/c500-599/5650000090.htmhttp://www.pantagraph.com/news/article_6ade6d44-a162-54d1-9be0-88bebf181f6d.html primarily aimed at the crime of a person over 21 years of age bullying a person under 18 years of age.
In addition, prosecutors will sometimes use other legal avenues to prosecute offenders. In the case of Tyler Clementi, who killed himself after video of his homosexual encounter was broadcast on the Internet, prosecutors charged the defendants with invasion of privacy and computer crimes. Like the Meier case, the Clementi case spurred legislators (this time, in New Jersey) to pass a law specifically aimed at bullying, an "Anti-bullying Bill of Rights".http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/11/nj_assembly_passes_anti-bullyi.html
While some laws are written such that the focus on cyberbullying is the set of acts that occur within a school, others are more general, targeting cyberbullying no matter where it occurs. In addition, some of these newly written laws (like one in Connecticut) put more of an onus on the school system, mandating that the school's administration must intervene at the first sign of bullying.[tpl]cite news|last=Keating|first=Christopher|title=Stronger Anti-Bullying Bill Approved By Committee|url=http://articles.courant.com/2011-03-23/news/hc-bully-bill-0324-20110323_1_cyberbullying-bill-mandates-new-department|accessdate=24 April 2011|date=23 March 2011[/tpl]
Finally, it's not uncommon for cyberbullying to be coupled with "traditional", in-person bullying, for example, in the suicide of Phoebe Prince. Students at her school had bullied her for months in school, and that harassment eventually moved online as well. As in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Missouri, the Prince case led to stricter anti-bullying legislation in Massachusetts.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/05/04/grieving_family_by_his_side_governor_signs_legislation/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Noah | last=Bierman | title=Grieving family by his side, governor signs legislation | date=4 May 2010[/tpl]

====Legislation at the state level====

Some U.S. states have begun to address the problem of cyberbullying. States that have passed legislation have done so generally in response to incidents within that state, to address what they believe to be shortcomings in federal laws, or to expand protection to victims above and beyond existing statutes.
There are laws that only address online harassment of children or focus on child predators as well as laws that protect adult cyberstalking victims, or victims of any age. While some sites specialize in laws that protect victims age 18 and under, Working to Halt Online Abuse is a help resource listing current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws.Current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws WHOA It also lists those states that do not have laws yet and related laws from other countries.

=====California=====

California passed the first cyberstalking law in 1999.Katie Dean, The Epidemic of Cyberstalking, Wired, May 1, 2000. (ยง646.9 of the California Penal Code.)ยง646.9 of the California Penal Code Its first use resulted in a six-year sentence for a man who harassed a woman who could identify him.Tom Zeller, Despite Laws, Stalkers Roam On the Internet, New York Times, April 17, 2006. After sending hundreds of threatening e-mails to an actress, another male convicted after spending months in jail waiting for trial was sentenced in 2001 to five years probation, forbidden access to computers and forced to attend mental health counseling. Cyberstalking garnering more serious response, Associated Press, June 29, 2001. In 2011 a man was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation before sentencing for cyberstalking.Man convicted of cyberstalking to undergo psychiatric evaluation before sentencing, CBS 8 News, October 24, 2011. On January 1, 2009, a California law became effective that allows schools to suspend or expel students who harass other students online. It also mandates that schools develop policies to address the problem.Jessica Calefati, California Law Targets Cyberbullying, US News, January 7, 2009. In addition, Section 1708.7 of the California Civil Code outlines grounds for an individual suing their cyberstalker and any accomplices for general damages, special damages, and punitive damages for cyberstalking.California Civil Code Section 1708-1725.

=====Florida=====

In 2008, Florida passed the "Jeffrey Johnston Stand Up For All Students Act" in response to the suicide of 15-year-old Jeffrey Johnston, who had suffered cyberbullying over a long period of time.http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=4774894&page=1 Somewhat unique among state laws regarding cyberbullying is a provision that withholds funding for schools who are not in compliance with the provision that they must inform parents of those involved in cyberbullyingโboth the bully and the target.

=====Illinois=====

According to "Who@: Working to Halt Online Abuse":
(a) Harassment through electronic communications is the use of electronic communication for any of the following
purposes:
(b) As used in this Act: 
(c) Telecommunications carriers, commercial mobile service providers, and providers of information services, including, but not limited to, Internet service providers and hosting service providers, are not liable under this Section, except for willful and wanton misconduct, by virtue of the transmission, storage, or caching of electronic communications or messages of others or by virtue of the provision of other related telecommunications, commercial mobile services, or information services used by others in violation of this Section. (Source: P.A. 95-849, eff. 1-1-09; 95-984, eff. 6-1-09; 96-328, eff. 8-11-09.)

=====Massachusetts=====

In response to Phoebe Prince's suicide, as well as that of Carl Walkerโboth of whom had been bullied before taking their livesโthe Massachusetts legislature in 2010 passed what advocates call one of the toughest anti-bullying laws in the nation. The law prohibits both online taunting and physical or emotional abuse, and mandates training for faculty and students at schools. It further mandates that school administrators inform parents of bulling that occurs within the schools themselves.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20004060-504083.html | work=CBS News | title=Cyber Bullying Illegal: Mass. Governor Signs Landmark Anti-Bullying Law[/tpl]

=====Missouri=====

As noted previously, in 2008 Missouri revised its statutes on harassment to include harassment and stalking through electronic and telephonic communications and cyber-bullying after the suicide of Megan Meier.Missouri Gov. Blunt Signs Bill Outlawing Cyberbullying

=====Texas=====

Texas enacted the Stalking by Electronic Communications Act in 2001.http://www.haltabuse.org/resources/laws/texas.shtml

=====Washington state=====

Washington takes the approach of putting the focus on cyberbullying prevention and response directly on the schools. The law also requires schools to create policies to address bullying in a general sense.http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?year=2007&bill=5288http://www.bullypolice.org/wa_law.html

====Legislation at the federal level====

Attempts at legislating cyberbullying have been tried at the federal level, primarily because the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution specifically provides that only the federal government can regulate commerce between the states; this includes electronic communication over the Internet. An early example, the Violence Against Women Act, passed in 2000, included cyberbullying in a part of interstate status on harassment.

=====Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act=====

In 2009, Representative Linda Sรกnchez (D-CA) brought legislation titled the "Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act" before the U.S. House of Representatives. Her efforts were met with little enthusiasm, however, as Representatives from both the Republican and Democratic parties were concerned with the bill's impact on the freedom of speech.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/09/cyberbullyingbill/ | work=Wired | first=David | last=Kravets | title=Cyberbullying Bill Gets Chilly Reception | date=30 September 2009[/tpl] One of the oft-cited arguments against the bill comes from talk radio, with the concern expressed being that the law would be used to silence political opponents who use the airwaves to espouse divergent viewpoints.http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/federal-cyberbullying-law-worth-a-try/http://www.talkfrontier.com/2009/06/30/hate-cyber-bullying-bills-could-threaten-talk-radio/ Another issue is that would make violation of the law a felony, rather than a misdemeanor as has been done in most states. Opponents of the bill argue that since the target of such legislation is nominally teenagers, this would put an undue burden on the prison systemโsince there are no long-term facilities for teenage offenders at the federal level. In addition, opponents call the proposed sentences (up to two years incarceration) excessive.http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/federal-cyberbullying-law-worth-a-try/
While Sรกnchez' bill was discussed in committee, it has not passed that stage as of 2012.http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.01966:

=====Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act=====

In early March 2011, U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and Representative Rush D. Holt, Jr. (D-NJ-12) introduced the "Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act", which would mandate that colleges and universities that receive federal funding have policies in place to address harassmentโincluding cyberbullying.http://www.nj.com/gloucester-county/index.ssf/2011/03/federal_bill_will_help_combat.htmlhttp://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:2:./temp/~bd1uH9:@@@L&summ2=m&|/home/LegislativeData.php| Universities would be required to address harassment that focuses on real or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. The bill would also enable the U.S. Department of Education to provide training to institutes of higher education to prevent or address harassment.http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:2:./temp/~bd1uH9:@@@L&summ2=m&|/home/LegislativeData.php| Furthermore, the bill addresses not just student-to-student harassment, but also harassment of students by faculty or staff as well.
However, like the Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act, this bill also has its detractors. Opponents point out that harassment on college campuses is already prohibited under existing laws; furthermore, they point out that harassment based on sexual orientation is also covered under existing statutes.http://thefire.org/article/12945.html In addition, as with the Sรกnchez bill, there are questions as to the free speech implications.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nationalreview.com/phi-beta-cons/254164/tyler-clementi-act-and-threats-free-speech-david-french [/tpl]

===India===

Prior to February 2013, there were no laws that directly regulate cyberstalking in India. India's Information Technology Act of 2000 (IT Act) was a set of laws to regulate the cyberspace. However, it merely focused on financial crimes and neglected interpersonal criminal behaviours such as cyberstalking (Behera, 2010; Halder & Jaishankar, 2008; Nappinai, 2010). In 2013, Indian Parliament made amendments to the Indian Penal Code, introducing cyberstalking as a criminal offence.[tpl]cite web|title=Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013|url=http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=16 April 2013[/tpl] Stalking has been defined as a man who follows or contacts a woman, despite clear indication of disinterest to such contact by the woman, or monitoring of use of internet or electronic communication of a woman. A man committing the offence of stalking would be liable for imprisonment up to three years for the first offence, and shall also be liable to fine and for any subsequent conviction would be liable for imprisonment up to five years and with fine.

===Poland===

Stalking is illegal since 2011.http://blog.rp.pl/prawoipodatki/2011/06/14/stalking-w-polskim-prawie-karnym/

===New Zealand===

New Zealand Minister of Justice Judith Collins plans to introduce a law that would make it an offence to incite people to commit suicide, or post material that is grossly offensive by the end of 2013.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Cyber-bullies-could-be-jailed/tabid/423/articleID/292936/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Cyber bullies could be jailed| date=April 4, 2013[/tpl]
