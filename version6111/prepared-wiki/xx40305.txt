[[Nectar loyalty card]]

Nectar is the largest loyalty card scheme in the United Kingdom comprising partner companies including the supermarket chain Sainsbury's and BP.  A separate Nectar programme operates in Italy and Chile.
Nectar was launched in 2002 by Loyalty Management Group, then chaired by Sir Keith Mills, the founder of Air Miles.  The programme was re-branded in 2007 to reflect a clear association with rewards.  Loyalty Management Group was purchased by Aeroplan in 2009.[tpl]cite web|title=Nectar... details of the UK coalition loyalty programme|url=http://www.thewisemarketer.com/features/read.asp?id=15|publisher=The wise marketer|accessdate=25 July 2011[/tpl]

==Benefits to consumers==

Points are normally collected at a rate of two points for every £1 spent. Extra points may be earned when buying certain products or during particular promotions.  The number of points on offer can vary, fuel for instance, collects points at a rate of one point per litre.
Customers also receive 1 Nectar point for every carrier bag they re-use.
Sainsbury's shoppers effectively receive under 1% discount on goods purchased there.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] After spending £250 (with each receipt rounded down to the nearest pound), 500 points are earned, which translates to a rebate of £2.50 to be redeemed at the next shop. The same applies at Homebase. Nectar cardholders also collect points from selected online retailers, if the purchase is made via the Nectar website.
As a rule of thumb, collectors usually get back 0.5p for every point collected. One must collect at least 500 points to be eligible for any offers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]

==Redemption==

To be eligible to redeem at a given Sainsbury's store, the customer must have collected Nectar points in that store within the previous twelve months, and at least 24 hours earlier.  A workaround procedure has since been put in place allowing customers to redeem points at any store.  Points may be redeemed at any Argos or Homebase store without the cardholder having shopped in that particular store before, as these retailers operate web-based till systems that can communicate with the Nectar system as and when required.  This is in contrast to the Sainsbury's till system, which communicates with Nectar just once per day, during the night, and only downloads cardholder information to a store if the card has been swiped in that store in the past twelve months.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nectar.com/about-nectar/legal/general-reward-conditions.points |title=Nectar Redemption Rules|accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl]
Nectar offers a range of non-cash rewards. Providing the card is used to collect points at least once in any twelve-month period, Nectar points do not expire. This allows cardholders to save up for more expensive rewards, such as Eurostar tickets and money off holidays with Expedia.
