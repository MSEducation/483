The Cemetery of the Evergreens is a non-denominational cemetery in Brooklyn and Queens, New York, colloquially called Evergreen Cemetery. It was incorporated in 1849, not long after the passage of New York's Rural Cemetery Act spurred development of cemeteries outside Manhattan. For a time, it was the busiest cemetery in New York City; in 1929 there were 4,673 interments.  The cemetery borders Brooklyn and Queens and covers [tpl]convert|225|acre|km2[/tpl] of rolling hills and gently sloping meadows. It features several thousand trees and flowering shrubs in a park-like setting.  The Evergreens is the final resting place of more than 526,000 people.

==History==

The Evergreens was built on the principle of the rural cemetery. Two of the era's most noted landscape architects, Andrew Jackson Downing and Alexander Jackson Davis, were instrumental in the layout of the cemetery grounds.
The Evergreens has a monument to eight unidentified victims of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of March 25, 1911. In 2011, researchers were able to provide names to these last eight dead.[tpl]cite news |title=The Fire That Changed Everything |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/opinion/23wed4.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 22, 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
