[[Opportunity cost]]

CATEGORIES: Microeconomics, Costs, Economics terminology, Time-based economics

In microeconomic theory, the opportunity cost of a choice is the value of the best alternative forgone, in a situation in which a choice needs to be made between several mutually exclusive alternatives given limited resources. Assuming the best choice is made, it is the "cost" incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would be had by taking the second best choice available.[tpl]cite web |work=Investopedia |title=Opportunity Cost |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp |accessdate=2010-09-18[/tpl]  The New Oxford American Dictionary defines it as "the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen". Opportunity cost is a key concept in economics, and has been described as expressing "the basic relationship between scarcity and choice".[tpl]cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=opportunity+cost&edition=current&button_search=GO |title=Opportunity cost |encyclopedia=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics Online |author=James M.

The concept seems a simple one, useful when applied to making everyday decisions about how best to spend limited time money. However, even professional economists have forgotten or had difficulty in applying it.[tpl]cite news|authorlink = Ross Gittins|last=Gittins|first=Ross|title=At the coal face economists are struggling to measure up|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/at-the-coal-face-economists-are-struggling-to-measure-up-20140418-36wde.html|publisher= The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=23 April 2014|date=19 April 2014[/tpl] 

==History==

The term was coined in 1914 by Austrian economist Friedrich von Wieser in his book [tpl]lang|de|Theorie der gesellschaftlichen Wirtschaft[/tpl].[tpl]cite book |author=Friedrich von Wieser |authorlink=Friedrich von Wieser |year=1927 |editor=A.

==Opportunity costs in production==

Explicit costs are opportunity costs that involve direct monetary payment by producers. The opportunity cost of the factors of production not already owned by a producer is the price that the producer has to pay for them. For instance, a firm spends $100 on electrical power consumed, their opportunity cost is $100.
Implicit costs (also called implied, imputed or notional costs) are the opportunity costs implied by the uses to which the actor (i.e., firm) allocates their existing (owned) resources, or factors of production. For example: a manufacturer has previously purchased 1000 tons of steel and the machinery to produce a widget.  The opportunity costs of selling the steel and renting the machinery (instead of producing the widget) are implicit costs.

==Evaluation==

Note that opportunity cost is not the sum of the available alternatives when those alternatives are, in turn, mutually exclusive to each other – it is the value (that is, the benefit) of the next best alternative. The opportunity cost of a city's decision to build the hospital on its vacant land is the loss of the land for a sporting center, or the inability to use the land for a parking lot, or the money which could have been made from selling the land. Use for any one of those purposes would preclude the possibility to implement any of the other.
