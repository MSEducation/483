Also, Juventus were identified by the people at the time as "the team that represented the entire population" or "the team of Italy"—an appellative that still identifies the club mainly outside Italy,— allowing they to perform the leading role in the formation of a national identity through sport, encouraging the phenomenon of nationalization in the country; and a symbol against the fascist government oppression due to the policy adopted by the Agnelli family in the Torinese club and FIAT, the family-owned company. Subsequently, another increase of the club's fan base as a result of the Southern migration to Turin, massive in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the team successes at the time, became Juventus the team-symbol of the Italian economic miracle and the postwar Italian society.

[tpl]harvcol|Papi|2004[/tpl] This is reflected, among others, in the club's contribution to the national team, uninterrupted since the second half of the 1920s and recognised as one of the most influential in international football, having performed a decisive role in the World Cup triumphs of 1934, 1982 and 2006.[tpl]cite news|author=Peter Staunton|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/38180164/ns/sports-world_cup/|title=Ten World Cup teams influenced by one club|publisher=NBC Sports|date=10 July 2010|accessdate=23 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]harvcol|Graziano|2011|pp=2–6[/tpl]

==History==

===Early years===

Juventus were founded as Sport Club Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the Massimo D'Azeglio Lyceum school in Turin,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.magicajuventus.com/storia_juventus.php|title=Storia della Juventus Football Club|work=magicajuventus.com|language=Italian|accessdate=8 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] but were renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/site/eng/CLUB_storia.asp|work=Juventus Football Club S.p.A official website|title=Juventus Football Club: The History|accessdate=9 August 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080729181702/http://www.juventus.com/site/eng/CLUB_storia.asp |archivedate=29 July 2008[/tpl] The club joined the Italian Football Championship during 1900. During this period the team wore a pink and black kit. Juventus first won the league championship in 1905 while playing at their Velodromo Umberto I ground. By this time the club colours had changed to black and white stripes, inspired by English side Notts County.
There was a split at the club in 1906, after some of the staff considered moving Juve out of Turin. President Alfredo Dick was unhappy with this and left with some prominent players to found FBC Torino which in turn spawned the Derby della Mole.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/stories/classicderby/news/newsid=924118.html#injuries+clouding+turin+derby|work=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|title=FIFA Classic Rivalries: Torino vs Juventus|accessdate=29 June 2007[/tpl] Juventus spent much of this period steadily rebuilding after the split, surviving the First World War.

===League dominance===

Fiat owner Edoardo Agnelli gained control of the club in 1923, and built a new stadium. This helped the club to its second scudetto (league championship) in the 1925–26 season beating Alba Roma with an aggregate score of 12–1, Antonio Vojak's goals were essential that season. The club established itself as a major force in Italian football since the 1930s, becoming the country's first professional club and the first with a decentralised fan base,[tpl]harv|Papa|1993|p=271[/tpl] which led it to win a record of five consecutive Italian championships the first four under the management of Carlo Carcano and form the core of the Italy national team during the Vittorio Pozzo's era, including the 1934 world champion squad.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/tablesi/ital-intres1930.html|title=Italy – International Matches 1930-1939|work=The Record Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=4 January 2009[/tpl] With star players such as Raimundo Orsi, Luigi Bertolini, Giovanni Ferrari and Luis Monti amongst others.
Juventus moved to the Stadio Comunale, but for the rest of the 1930s and the majority of the 1940s they were unable to recapture championship dominance. After the Second World War, Gianni Agnelli was appointed honorary president. The club added two more league championships to its name in the 1949–50 and 1951–52 seasons, the latter of which was under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver. Two new strikers were signed during 1957–58; Welshman John Charles and Italo-Argentine Omar Sivori, playing alongside longtime member Giampiero Boniperti. That season saw Juventus awarded with the Golden Star for Sport Excellence to wear on their shirts after becoming the first Italian side to win ten league titles. In the same season, Omar Sivori became the first ever player at the club to win the European Footballer of the Year. The following season they beat Fiorentina to complete their first league and cup double, winning Serie A and Coppa Italia. Boniperti retired in 1961 as the all-time top scorer at the club, with 182 goals in all competitions, a club record which stood for 45 years.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.juventus.com/site/ita/NEWS_newseventi_E63B2C18BD6A41F5BEDCFEC8BF94195C.asp|title=Tanti auguri, Presidente!|publisher=Juventus Football Club S.p.A official website|language=Italian|accessdate=3 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]
During the rest of the decade the club won the league just once more in 1966–67, However, the 1970s saw Juventus further solidify their strong position in Italian football. Under former player Čestmír Vycpálek they won the scudetto in 1971–72 and 1972–73, with players such as Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio and José Altafini breaking through. During the rest of the decade they won the league twice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The later win was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who helped the club's domination continue on into the early part of the 1980s and to form the backbone of the Italian national team during Enzo Bearzot's era, including the 1978 FIFA World Cup and 1982 world champion squads.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/tablesi/ital-intres1970.html|title=Italy – International Matches 1970-1979|work=The Record Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=4 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/tablesi/ital-intres1980.html|title=Italy – International Matches 1980-1989|work=The Record Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=4 January 2009[/tpl]

===European stage===

The Trapattoni-era was highly successful in the 1980s; the club started the decade off well, winning the league title three more times by 1984. This meant Juventus had won 20 Italian league titles and were allowed to add a second golden star to their shirt, thus becoming the only Italian club to achieve this. Around this time the club's players were attracting considerable attention; Paolo Rossi was named European Footballer of the Year following his contribution to Italy's victory in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where he was named player of the tournament.[tpl]harv|Glanville|2005|p=263[/tpl]
Frenchman Michel Platini was also awarded the European Footballer of the Year title for three years in a row; 1983, 1984 and 1985, which is a record. Juventus are the only club to have players from their club winning the award in four consecutive years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/europa-poy.html|title=European Footballer of the Year ("Ballon d'Or")|work=The Record Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=8 June 2007[/tpl] Indeed it was Platini who scored the winning goal in the 1985 European Cup final against Liverpool, however this was marred by a tragedy which changed European football.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/socialresponsibility/antiracism/news/newsid=300034.html|title=Olsson urges anti-racism action|publisher=Union des Associations Européennes de Football|date=13 May 2005|accessdate=22 January 2011[/tpl] That year, Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three major UEFA competitions and, after their triumph in the Intercontinental Cup, the club also became the first in association football history—and remain the world's only one at present—to have won all possible confederation competitions and the club world title.[tpl]harvcol|TheTechnician (UEFA)|2010|p=5[/tpl]
With the exception of winning the closely contested Italian Championship of 1985–86, the rest of the 1980s were not very successful for the club. As well as having to contend with Diego Maradona's Napoli, both of the Milanese clubs, Milan and Internazionale, won Italian championships. In 1990, Juventus moved into their new home, the Stadio delle Alpi, which was built for the 1990 World Cup.[tpl]harv|Goldblatt|2007|p=602[/tpl]

===Lippi era of success===

Marcello Lippi took over as Juventus manager at the start of the 1994–95 campaign. His first season at the helm of the club was a successful one, as Juventus recorded their first Serie A championship title since the mid-1980s. The crop of players during this period featured Ciro Ferrara, Roberto Baggio, Gianluca Vialli and a young Alessandro Del Piero. Lippi lead Juventus to the Champions League the following season, beating Ajax on penalties after a 1–1 draw in which Fabrizio Ravanelli scored for Juve.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/season=1995/index.html|title=1995/96: Juve hold their nerve|publisher=Union des Associations Européennes de Football|date=22 May 1996[/tpl]
The club did not rest long after winning the European Cup, more highly regarded players were brought into the fold in the form of Zinedine Zidane, Filippo Inzaghi and Edgar Davids. At home Juventus won Serie A in 1996–97 and 1997–98, as well as the 1996 UEFA Super Cup[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/history/season=1996/index.html|publisher=Union des Associations Européennes de Football|title=1996: Dazzling Juve shine in Paris|date=1 March 1997[/tpl] and the 1996 Intercontinental Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/matchreport/newsid=512164.html#toyota+cup+1996|title=Toyota Cup 1996|work=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|date=26 November 1996[/tpl] Juventus reached the 1997 and 1998 Champions League finals during this period, but lost out to Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=1996/round=75/index.html|title=UEFA Champions League 1996–97: Final|work=Union des Associations Européennes de Football|date=28 May 1997[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=1997/round=1169/index.html|title=UEFA Champions League 1997–98: Final|work=Union des Associations Européennes de Football|date=20 May 1997[/tpl]
After a season's absence Lippi returned, signing big name players such as Gianluigi Buffon, David Trezeguet, Pavel Nedvěd and Lilian Thuram, helping the team to two more scudetto titles in the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons. Juventus were also part of an all Italian Champions League final in 2003 but lost out to Milan on penalties after the game ended in a 0–0 draw. The following year, Lippi was appointed as Italy's head coach, bringing an end to one of the most fruitful managerial spells in Juventus' history.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legaseriea.it/it/serie-a-tim/albo-d-oro|title=Albo d'oro Serie A TIM|work=Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A|language=Italian|accessdate=21 May 2012[/tpl]

===The "Calciopoli" scandal===

Fabio Capello became its coach in 2004, and led Juventus to two more Serie A titles. However, in May 2006, Juventus became one of the five clubs linked to a Serie A match fixing scandal, the result of which saw the club relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history. The club was also stripped of the two titles won under Capello in 2005 and 2006.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5164194.stm|title=Italian trio relegated to Serie B|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 July 2006|date=14 July 2006[/tpl]
Many key players left following the demotion to Serie B, including Thuram, star striker Zlatan Ibrahimović and defensive stalwart Fabio Cannavaro. However, other big name players such as Buffon, Del Piero and Nedvěd remained to help the club return to Serie A while youngsters from the Primavera such as Sebastian Giovinco and Claudio Marchisio were integrated into the first team. The bianconeri were promoted straight back up as league winners after the 2006–07 season while captain Del Piero claimed the top scorer award with 21 goals.

===Return to Serie A===

Since their return to Serie A in the 2007–08 season, former Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri managed Juventus for two seasons.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6719901.stm|title=Ranieri appointed Juventus coach|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 June 2007|date=4 June 2007[/tpl] They finished in third place in their first return season, and qualified for the 2008–09 Champions League third qualifying round in the preliminary stages. Juventus reached the group stages, where they beat Real Madrid in both home and away legs, before losing in the knockout round to Chelsea. Ranieri was sacked following a string of unsuccessful results, and Ciro Ferrara was appointed as manager on a temporary basis for the last two games of the season,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://it.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=831044.html|title=Via Ranieri, ecco Ferrara|publisher=Union des Associations Européennes de Football|language=Italian|accessdate=19 May 2009[/tpl] before being subsequently appointed as the manager for the 2009–10 season.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=836319.html|title=Ferrara handed Juventus reins|publisher=Union des Associations Européennes de Football|accessdate=5 June 2009[/tpl]
However, Ferrara's stint as Juventus manager proved to be unsuccessful, with Juventus knocked out of Champions League and Coppa Italia, and just lying on the sixth place in the league table at the end of January 2010, leading to the dismissal of Ciro Ferrara and naming Alberto Zaccheroni as caretaker manager. Zaccheroni could not help the side improve, as Juventus finished the season in seventh place in Serie A. For the 2010–11 season, Jean-Claude Blanc was replaced by Andrea Agnelli as the club's president. Agnelli's first action was to replace Zaccheroni and Director of Sport Alessio Secco with Sampdoria manager Luigi Delneri and Director of Sport Giuseppe Marotta.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.juventus.it/site/ita/NEWS_newsseriea_24CA3FB221F04352B60AC7DAD8C7913E.asp|language=Italian|title=Zaccheroni nuovo allenatore della Juventus|publisher=Juventus Football Club S.p.A official website|date=29 January 2010|accessdate=29 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] However, Delneri failed to improve their fortunes and was dismissed. Former player and fan favourite Antonio Conte, fresh after winning promotion with Siena, was named as Delneri's replacement.
With Conte as manager, Juventus went unbeaten for the entire season. Towards the second half of the season, the team was mostly competing with northern rivals Milan for first place in a tight contest. Juventus won the title on the 37th matchday, after beating Cagliari 2–0, and Milan losing to Internazionale 4–2. After a 3–1 win in the final matchday against Atalanta, Juventus became the first team to go the season unbeaten in the current 38-game format. Other noteworthy achievements include the biggest away win (5–0 at Fiorentina), best defensive record (20 goals conceded, fewest ever in the current league format) in Serie A and second best in the top six European leagues that year.[tpl]cite news|title=A Scudetto built on defense|url=http://www.juventus.com/juve/en/news/15may2012_difesa|publisher=juventus.com|date=15 May 2012[/tpl]

==Colours, badge and nicknames==

Juventus have played in black and white striped shirts, with white shorts, sometimes black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie, but only because they had been sent the wrong shirts. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nottscountyfc.co.uk/page/HistoryDetail/0,,10426~1028229,00.html#continue|title=Black & White|publisher=Notts County F.C. official website|accessdate=7 November 2008[/tpl] Extracts taken from the Official History of Notts County and article kindly reproduced by the Daily Mail.
Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juve have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.
Juventus Football Club's official emblem has undergone different and small modifications since the 1920s. The last modification of the Old Lady's badge took place before 2004–05 season. At the present time, the emblem of the team is a black-and-white oval shield of a type used by Italian ecclesiastics. It is divided in five vertical stripes: two white stripes and three black stripes, inside which are the following elements; in its upper section, the name of the society superimposed on a white convex section, over golden curvature (gold for honour). The white silhouette of a charging bull is in the lower section of the oval shield, superimposed on a black old French shield; the charging bull is a symbol of the Comune di Torino.
There is also a black silhouette of a mural crown above the black spherical triangle's base. This is a reminiscence to Augusta Tourinorum, the old city of the Roman era which the present capital of Piedmont region is its cultural heiress.
In the past, the convex section of the emblem had a blue colour (another symbol of Turin) and, furthermore, its shape was concave. The old French shield and the mural crown, also in the lower section of the emblem, had a considerably greater size with respect to the present. The two Golden Stars for Sport Excellence were located above the convex and concave section of Juventus' emblem. During the 1980s, the club emblem was the silhouette of a zebra, to both sides of the equide's head, the two golden stars and, above this badge, forming an arc, the club's name.
During its history, the club has acquired a number of nicknames, la Vecchia SignoraOr Madama in Piedmontese language. (the Old Lady) being the best example. The "old" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means "youth" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The "lady" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed la Fidanzata d'Italia (the Girlfriend of Italy), because over the years it has received a high level of support from Southern Italian immigrant workers (particularly from Naples and Palermo), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include; i bianconeri (the black-and-whites), le zebre (the zebrasThe zebra is Juventus' official mascot because the black and white vertical stripes in its present home jersey and emblem remembered the zebra's stripes.) in reference to Juventus' colours. I gobbi (the hunchbacks) is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team's players. The most widely accepted origin of gobbi dates to the fifties, when the bianconeri team was wearing a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had an opening on the chest with laces, generated a bulge on the back (a sort of parachute effect), giving the impression that the players have a hunchback.[tpl]cite web | first = Paolo | last = Granzotto | title = Juve, la Signora "gobba" che ci prova | publisher = Il Giornale | date = 16 June 2006 | url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/juve-signora-gobba-che-ci-prova.html | accessdate = 21 December 2012 | language = Italian [/tpl]

==Stadiums==

After the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905, the first year of the scudetto, and in 1906, years in which it played at the Corso Re Umberto.
From 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp, and before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles. At the end of 1933 they began to play at the new Stadio Mussolini stadium inaugurated for the 1934 World Championships. After the Second World War, the stadium was renamed as Stadio Comunale Vittorio Pozzo. Juventus played home matches at the ground for 57 years, a total of 890 league matches.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/site/eng/JPL_stadioolimpico.asp|title=Juventus places: Olympic Stadium|work=Juventus Football Club S.p.A official website|accessdate=12 March 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080308093826/http://www.juventus.com/site/eng/JPL_stadioolimpico.asp |archivedate=8 March 2008[/tpl] The team continued to host training sessions at the stadium until July 2003.
From 1990 until the 2005–06 season, the Torinese side contested their home matches at Stadio delle Alpi, built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, although in very rare circumstances, the club played some home games in other stadia such as Renzo Barbera at Palermo, Dino Manuzzi at Cesena and the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza at Milan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/site/eng/JPL_stadiodellealpi.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080121040215/http://www.juventus.com/site/eng/JPL_stadiodellealpi.asp|archivedate=21 January 2008|title=Juventus places: Delle Alpi Stadium|work=Juventus Football Club S.p.A official website|accessdate=12 March 2008[/tpl]
In August 2006, the bianconeri returned to play in the Stadio Comunale, now known as Stadio Olimpico, after the restructuring of the stadium for the 2006 Winter Olympics onwards.
In November 2008 Juventus announced that they will invest around €120 million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of Delle Alpi. Unlike the old ground, there will not be a running track; instead the pitch will be only 7.5 meters away from the stands. The planned capacity is 41,000. Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011 for the start of the 2011–12 season.

==Supporters==

Juventus are the best-supported football club in Italy, with over 12 million fans or tifosi, which represent approximately 29% of the total Italian football fans according to a research published in September 2010 by Italian research agency Demos & Pi,[tpl]harvcol|Demos & Pi|2010|pp=3; 9–10[/tpl] and one of the most supported football clubs in the world, with 180 million supporters (43 million in Europe alone), particularly in the Mediterranean countries, to which a large number of Italian diaspora have emigrated.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=538662.html|title=Napoli: Back where they belong|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|accessdate=22 June 2007[/tpl] The Torinese side has fan clubs branches across the globe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.juventusclubdoc.it/index.php/Table/I-Club-Esteri/|title=I club esteri|work=Centro Coordinamento Juventus Club DOC|language=Italian|accessdate=1 November 2008[/tpl]
Demand for Juventus tickets in occasional home games held away from Turin is high; suggesting that Juventus have stronger support in other parts of the country. Juve is widely and especially popular throughout mainland Southern Italy, Sicily and Malta, leading the team to have one of the largest followings in its away matches,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://calcioinborsa.com/TifosiPerRegione.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070205055908/http://calcioinborsa.com/TifosiPerRegione.htm|archivedate=5 February 2007|title=Supporters by region|publisher=calcioinborsa.com|language=Italian|accessdate=5 February 2007[/tpl] more than in Turin itself.

==Rivalries==

Juventus have significant rivalries with two clubs. Their traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino F.C. and matches between the two side are known as the Derby della Mole (Derby of Turin). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff. Their most high-profile rivalry is with Internazionale, another big Serie A club located in Milan, the capital of the neighbouring region of Lombardy. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the Derby d'Italia (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other at the top of the league table, hence the intense rivalry.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.tuttosport.com/calcio/serie_a/juventus/2008/09/22-4377/Juve-Inter,+storia+di+una+rivalit%C3%A0|title=Juve-Inter, storia di una rivalità|publisher=Tuttosport|language=Italian|date=22 September 2008[/tpl] Up until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-Calciopoli, with the return of Juventus to Serie A.
They also have rivalries with Milan,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2003/05/15/juve-milan-la-sfida-infinita-storia-di.html|title=Juve e Milan, la sfida infinita storia di rivalità e di campioni|publisher=La Repubblica|language=Italian|date=15 May 2003[/tpl] Roma[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.tuttosport.com/calcio/serie_a/juventus/2008/10/31-8095/Juve-Roma%2C+rivalit%C3%A0+antica|title=Juve-Roma, rivalità antica|publisher=Tuttosport|language=Italian|date=31 October 2008[/tpl] and Fiorentina.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Juventus/Primo_Piano/2009/01/22/juvefiorentina.shtml|title=Quell'antica ruggine tra Juve e Fiorentina|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|date=22 January 2009[/tpl]

==Youth programme==

The Juventus youth set-up has been recognised as one of the best in Italy for producing young talents.[tpl]Cite news|title=Juve, la strategia di Bettega: tornano i giovani|url=http://www.tuttosport.com/calcio/serie_a/juventus/calciomercato/2010/01/09-50503/Juve%2C+la+strategia+di+Bettega%3A+tornano+i+giovan|publisher=Tuttosport|date=9 January 2010|language=Italian[/tpl] While not all graduates made it to the first team, many have enjoyed successful careers in the Italian top flight. Under long-time coach Vincenzo Chiarenza, the Primavera (Under-20) squad enjoyed one of its successful periods, winning all age-group competitions from 2004 to 2006.
The youth system is also notable for its contribution to the Italian national senior and youth teams. 1934 World Cup winner Gianpiero Combi, 1936 Gold Medal and 1938 World Cup winner Pietro Rava, Giampiero Boniperti, Roberto Bettega, 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi and more recently, Claudio Marchisio and Sebastian Giovinco are a number of former graduates who have gone on to make the first team and full Italy squad.[tpl]Cite news|title=La signora Juventus è ringiovanita bene|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Juventus/Primo_Piano/2009/01/21/givanijuve.shtml|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|date=21 January 2009|language=Italian[/tpl]
