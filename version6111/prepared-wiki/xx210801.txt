==Career==

===Bayern Munich===

Kraft made his debut for Bayern's reserve team in 2006, and played in their first game in the newly formed 3. Liga on 17 July 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/3liga/spieltag/spielpaarungsbericht/object/864509 |language=German |publisher=licker |title=Bayern siegen verdient |accessdate=27 July 2008 |date=27 July 2008[/tpl] From 2008 to 2010 he was third-choice goalkeeper for the senior team, behind Hans-Jörg Butt and Michael Rensing. Following Rensing's release in 2010, he was promoted to second choice, and he made his first-team debut at the beginning of that season, in the 2010 DFL-Supercup.
On 23 November 2010 he made his debut Champions League match in Rome against AS Roma. Bayern lost 3–2 after going into half-time with a 0–2 lead. The young goalkeeper had a good start and made some outstanding saves. During the 2010–11 winter break, Bayern coach Louis van Gaal announced that Kraft would replace Hans-Jörg Butt as Bayern's first-choice 'keeper for the second half of the season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/raphael_honigstein/01/12/bayern.kraft.neuer/index.html|title=Van Gaal risks Bayern's future with promotion of Kraft as No. 1 keeper|author=Raphael Honigstein|work=Sports Illustrated|date=12 January 2011|accessdate=12 January 2011[/tpl] Kraft made his debut as Bayern's first-choice keeper in a 1–1 Bundesliga draw to VfL Wolfsburg. Kraft produced top performance with several impressive saves to help FC Bayern to a 1–0 win on 23 February 2011 in a round of 16 Champions League clash against Inter Milan.[tpl]cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/12570486.stm | title = Thomas Kraft could leave Bayern Munich | publisher = BBC Sport | accessdate = 25 February 2011 | date = 25 February 2011[/tpl] However, the decision to replace Butt with Kraft earned the displeasure of the Bayern board, and contributed to Van Gaal losing his job: after an error by Kraft allowed Christian Eigler to score the equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Nuremberg. Van Gaal – who was already due to leave – was sacked early, and temporarily replaced by his assistant Andries Jonker.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2011/apr/11/hannover-bundesliga-bayern-munich-mainz|title=Hannover emerge from the shadows for tilt at European dream|work=The Guardian|author=Raphael Honigstein|date=11 April 2011|accessdate=19 April 2011[/tpl] Jonker reinstated Butt at Kraft's expense in his first game in charge,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/2010-11/30/1013500/spielanalyse_bayern-muenchen-14_bayer-leverkusen-9.html|title=Bayern München – Bayer Leverkusen 5:1, 1.

===Hertha BSC===

On 1 July 2011, Kraft joined Hertha BSC, which was promoted to the Bundesliga along with FC Augsburg. On 16 October 2011, Kraft returned for the first time with Hertha back to his old club Bayern Munich which turned out to be a quite bitter reunion for Kraft; the Berlin club lost 0–4. Prior to the game, Kraft and two other members of Hertha (Christian Lell and Andreas Ottl) were honored with a bouquet of flowers by the Bayern staff and the fans were chanting pro Kraft throughout the game.
