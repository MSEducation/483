"Diese Welt" ("This World") was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1971, performed in German by Katja Ebstein. This was Ebstein's second, consecutive Eurovision entry; she had represented Germany at the 1970 contest with "Wunder gibt es immer wieder", which finished 3rd in a field of 12.
"Diese Welt" was performed fifth on the night (following Switzerland's Peter, Sue & Marc with "Les illusions de nos vingt ans" and preceding Spain's Karina with "En un mundo nuevo"). At the close of voting, it had received 100 points, placing 3rd in a field of 18.
The song deals with the wonder of the world, with Ebstein singing that it "is a gift which life gave us" and reminding her listeners that what becomes of it is up to its inhabitants. Ebstein also recorded the song in English (as "River Run, River Flow"), French ("Une autre rivière") and Spanish ("Este mundo"). 
It was succeeded as German representative at the 1972 Contest by Mary Roos with "Nur die Liebe läßt uns leben". Ebstein returned a third time to the Contest in 1980 with "Theater".
