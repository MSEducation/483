The liberal arts (Latin: artes liberales) are those subjects or skills that in classical antiquity were considered essential for a free person (a citizen) to know in order to take an active part in civic life. In Ancient Greece this included participating in public debate, defending oneself in court, serving on juries, and most importantly, military service (slaves and resident aliens were by definition excluded from the duties and responsibilities of citizenship). The aim of these studies was to produce a virtuous, knowledgeable, and articulate person. Grammar, rhetoric, and logic were the core liberal arts. During medieval times, when learning came under the purview of the Church, these subjects (called the Trivium) were extended to include the four other classical subjects of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy (which included the study of astrology). This extension was called the Quadrivium, and these well defined subjects originated during classical times. Together the Trivium and Quadrivium constituted the seven liberal arts of the medieval university curriculum. In the Renaissance, the Italian humanists, who in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the Middle Ages, rechristened the old Trivium with a new and more ambitious name: Studia humanitatis, and also increased its scope. They excluded logic and added to the traditional Latin grammar and rhetoric not only history, Greek, and moral philosophy (ethics), but made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group.Paul Oskar Kristeller, Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), p. 178. The educational curriculum of humanism spread throughout Europe during the sixteenth century and became the educational foundation for the schooling of European elites, the functionaries of political administration, the clergy of the various legally recognized churches, and the learned professions of law and medicine.Charles G. Nauert, Humanism and the Culture of Renaissance Europe (New Approaches to European History) (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 172-173. The ideal of a liberal arts, or humanistic education grounded in classical languages and literature, persisted until the middle of the twentieth century.
In modern times, liberal arts education is a term that can be interpreted in different ways. It can refer to certain areas of literature, languages, philosophy, history, mathematics, psychology, and science.[tpl]cite web | title = Liberal Arts: Encyclopædia Britannica Concise| work = Encyclopædia Britannica | url= http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts[/tpl] It can also refer to studies on a liberal arts degree program. For example, Harvard University offers a Master of Liberal Arts degree, which covers biological and social sciences as well as the humanities.Master of Liberal Arts on harvard.edu.

==History==

In classical antiquity, the "liberal arts" denoted those subjects of study that were considered essential for a free person (Latin: liber, "free")Ernst Robert Curtius, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages 1948, trans. Willard R. Trask (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973), p. 37. The classical sources include Cicero, De Oratore, I.72–73, III.127, and De re publica, I.30. to master in order to acquire those qualities that distinguished a free person from slaves[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] - the latter of whom formed the greater number of the population in the classical world. Contrary to popular belief, freeborn girls were as likely to receive formal education as boys, especially during the Roman Empire—unlike the lack of education, or purely manual/technical skills, proper to a slave.H. I. Marrou, A History of Education in Antiquity 1948, trans. George Lamb (London: Sheed & Ward, 1956), pp. 266–67. The "liberal arts" or "liberal pursuits" (Latin liberalia studia) were already so called in formal education during the Roman Empire; for example, Seneca the Younger discusses liberal arts in education from a critical Stoic point of view in Moral Epistle 88.[tpl]cite web|author=Ben Schneider |url=http://www.stoics.com/seneca_epistles_book_2.html#%E2%80%98LXXXVIII1 |title=Seneca Epistle 88|publisher=Stoics.com |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] The subjects that would become the standard "Liberal Arts" in Roman and Medieval times already comprised the basic curriculum in the enkuklios paideia or "education in a circle" of late Classical and Hellenistic Greece.
[tpl]anchor|Seven liberal arts|The seven liberal arts[/tpl] In the 5th century AD, Martianus Capella defined the seven Liberal Arts as: grammar, dialectic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. In the medieval Western university, the seven liberal arts were divided in two parts:[tpl]cite web | title = James Burke: The Day the Universe Changed In the Light Of the Above|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgXzwOV-WNI&t=02m26s[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Wagner|first=David Leslie|title=The Seven liberal arts in the Middle Ages|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XfQ2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=5 January 2013|year=1983|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253351852[/tpl] at Questia http://www.questia.com/read/96213334/the-seven-liberal-arts-in-the-middle-ages

==Modern usage==

Mathematics, science, arts, and language can all be considered part of the liberal arts.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] Some subsections of the liberal arts are trivium—the verbal arts: logic, grammar, and rhetoric; and quadrivium—the numerical arts: arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. Analyzing and interpreting information is also studied.
Academic areas that can be associated with the term liberal arts include:

==School structure==

The liberal arts education prepares the student for higher education at a university. They are thus meant for the more academically minded students.  In addition to the usual curriculum, students of a liberal arts education often study Latin and Ancient Greek.
Some liberal arts education provide general education, others have a specific focus. (This also differs from country to country.) The four traditional branches are:
Curricula differ from school to school, but generally include language, mathematics, informatics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, art (as well as crafts and design), music, history, philosophy, civics / citizenship,this subject has different names in the different states of Germany. See :de:Gemeinschaftskunde social sciences, and several foreign languages.
Schools concentrate not only on academic subjects, but on producing well-rounded individuals, so physical education and religion or ethics are compulsory, even in non-denominational schools which are prevalent. For example, the German constitution guarantees the separation of church and state, so although religion or ethics classes are compulsory, students may choose to study a specific religion or none at all.
Today, a number of other areas of specialization exist, such as gymnasiums specializing in economics, technology or domestic sciences. In some countries, there is a notion of progymnasium, which is equivalent to beginning classes of the full gymnasium, with the rights to continue education in a gymnasium. Here, the prefix "pro" indicates that this curriculum precedes normal gymnasium studies.

==In the United States==

In the United States, liberal arts colleges are schools emphasizing undergraduate study in the liberal arts.[tpl]cite web|title=Defining Liberal Arts Education|url=http://www.liberalarts.wabash.edu/storage/Defining_Liberal_Education.pdf|publisher=Wabash College|accessdate=9 December 2012[/tpl] Traditionally earned over four years of full-time study, some universities such as Saint Leo University,[tpl]cite web|url=http://online.saintleo.edu/academics/associate-programs/liberal-arts.aspx |title=Online Liberal Arts Associate Degree |publisher=Saint Leo University |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] Pennsylvania State University,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/letters-arts-and-sciences-associates/overview |title=Online Associate in Arts in Letters, Arts, and Sciences | Overview |publisher=Penn State University |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] Florida Institute of Technology[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.floridatechonline.com/undergraduate-aa-liberal-arts-degree/ |title=Associate's Degree in Liberal Arts - Liberal Arts Degree Online |publisher=Florida Institute of Technology |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] and New England College[tpl]cite web|title=Associates in Liberal Studies|url=http://www.newenglandcollegeonline.com/associates-degree-liberal-studies/|publisher=New England College[/tpl] have begun to offer an associate degree in liberal arts. Most students earn either[tpl]dubious|date=February 2013[/tpl] a Bachelor of Arts degree or a Bachelor of Science[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl][tpl]or|date=February 2013[/tpl] degree; on completing undergraduate study, students might progress to either a graduate school or a professional school (public administration, engineering, business, law, medicine, theology). The teaching is Socratic, typically with small classes, and often has a lower student-to-teacher ratio than at large universities; professors teaching classes are allowed to concentrate more on their teaching responsibilities than primary research professors or graduate student teaching assistants, in contrast to the instruction common in universities.[tpl]or|date=February 2013[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==In Europe==

Despite the European origin of the liberal arts college,[tpl]cite web | first =Philip | last =Harriman | title = Antecedents of the Liberal Arts College| publisher = The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 6, No. 2 (1935), pp. 63–71 | year =1935 | url= http://www.jstor.org/view/00221546/di962074/96p0148k/0[/tpl] the term liberal arts college usually denotes liberal arts colleges in the United States. Only recently, some efforts have been undertaken to "re-import" liberal arts education to continental Europe, as with Leiden University College The Hague, University College Utrecht, University College Maastricht, Amsterdam University College, Roosevelt Academy (now University College Roosevelt), Bratislava International School of Liberal Arts, and the European College of Liberal Arts. As well as the colleges listed above, some universities in the Netherlands offer bachelors programs in Liberal Arts and Sciences (Tilburg University). In the United Kingdom, King's College London and University College London launched liberal arts programmes in 2012. It is the curriculum of Forman Christian College in Lahore, Pakistan for Bachelors, the only institute in the country which offers this program.
Liberal arts (as a degree program) is just beginning to establish itself in Europe. For example, University College Dublin offers the degree, as does St. Marys University College Belfast, both institutions coincidentally on the island of Ireland. In the Netherlands, universities have opened constituent liberal arts colleges under the terminology university college since the late 1990s. It has been suggested that the liberal arts degree may become part of mainstream education provision in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other European countries. In 1999, the European College of Liberal Arts (now Bard College Berlin) was founded in Berlin [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/de/education/higher_education/berlins-sturdiest-ivory-tower-8661_10047.html?ppager=0 |title=Berlin's sturdiest ivory tower |publisher=Expatica.com |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] and in 2009 it introduced a 4-year Bachelor of Arts program in Value Studies taught in English,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20090313110639526 |title=GERMANY: New approach to liberal studies |publisher=Universityworldnews.com |date=15 March 2009 |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] leading to an interdisciplinary degree in the humanities. In 2010 the University of Winchester introduced its Modern Liberal Arts[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.winchester.ac.uk/mla |title=BA (Hons) Modern Liberal Arts |publisher=University of Winchester |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] undergraduate program, the first of its kind in the UK. In 2012, University College London began its interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences BASc degree (which has kinship with the liberal arts model) with 80 students.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/basc |title=Arts and Sciences (BASc) programmes |publisher=University College London |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] King's College London launched the BA Liberal Arts, which has a slant towards arts, humanities and social sciences subjects.[tpl]cite web|title=KCL - About Liberal Arts|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/liberal/index.aspx|accessdate=15 January 2014[/tpl]  The New College of the Humanities also launched a new liberal education programme. The four-year Bachelor’s Degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at University College Freiburg is the first of its kind in Germany. It started in October 2012 with 78 students.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ucf.uni-freiburg.de/las |title=Liberal Arts and Sciences Program (LAS) |publisher=''University College Freiburg |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] The first Liberal Arts degree program in Sweden was established at Gothenburg University in 2011,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flov.gu.se/utbildning/grundniva/liberal-arts/ |title=Liberal Arts, Gothenburg University |publisher=Flov.gu.se |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] followed by a Liberal Arts Bachelor Programme at Uppsala University's Campus Gotland in the autumn of 2013."Liberal Arts Programme at Uppsala University" The first Liberal Arts program in Georgia was introduced in 2005 by American-Georgian Initiative for Liberal Education (AGILE),[tpl]cite web|url=http://agile.ge/ |title=Agile |publisher=Agile.ge |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] an NGO.
