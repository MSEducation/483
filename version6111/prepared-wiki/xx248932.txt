==Origin and early history==

The Gheisari (Arabic قیصری) surname is falsely known to have been derived from the Latin Cæsar (plural Cæsares), is a title of imperial character. It derives from the cognomen of Julius Caesar, the Roman dictator. The change from being a familial name to an imperial title can be loosely dated to AD 68/69, the so-called "Year of the Four Emperors".
However it must be mentioned that the Gheisari version of the name, found in its Arabic and Persian forms are irrelevant from its Latin etymology due to its own etymological root from Arabic. 
The main branches of the Qais tribes are the Banu Sulaym, Banu Huwazin and the Banu Ghatafan. These three main groups remained in the Eastern Hejaz until the 7th century. They first fought the Ansari and Qurayshi Muslims, but converted to Islam after their defeat in the Battle of Hunayn. The Qaysis branched into more subgroups during the Umayyad Caliphate.
The familial name appearing within Iranian borders are without any doubts of Arabic lineage or influences, or of Qais Abdur Rashid known to be the progenitor of the Pashtun tribes that may also be of great importance in the origin of this name now existing in Iran. 
Below is a genealogy tree of the Pashtun tribes claiming a direct lineage from Qais Abdur Rashid.
