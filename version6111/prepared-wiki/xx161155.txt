Book Links began as a magazine published by the American Library Association that helps teachers, librarians, school library media specialists, and parents connect children with high-quality books. It is now "published as a quarterly print supplement to Booklist, at no additional cost to subscribers, rather than as a stand-alone magazine."http://www.ala.org/ala/newspresscenter/news/pressreleases2009/may2009/booklinks_publishing.cfm
