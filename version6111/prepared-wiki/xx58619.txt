Barb Tarbox, MSM (April 10, 1961 â€“ May 18, 2003) was one of the most well-known anti-smoking activists in Canada; a lifelong smoker dying of brain and lung cancers whose very open and frank discussions of her illness, its cause and its consequences, propelled her to the Canadian national stage. 
In high school, between the ages of 14 and 16, she was a model for fashion companies and joined many sports in her school. She wanted to be popular, and being a model wasn't enough---so she then became a smoker. During the last months of Tarbox's life she went around Canada teaching young adults the consequences of smoking.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.thestar.com/article/107783 | title = Anti-smoking crusader Barb Tarbox dead at 42 | accessdate = 2009-07-12 | date = 2003-06-20 | publisher = Toronto Star[/tpl] Perhaps most memorably, she emphasized how she was unable to quit smoking even after she found out that she had cancer.[tpl]cite web| url = http://moreresults.factiva.com/results/index/index.aspx?ref=TOR0000020050103e1120002a | title = Raging to the end; An intimate look at a dying woman's anti-smoking crusade She influenced thousands but secretly smoked to the last | accessdate = 2009-07-12 | date = 2005-01-02 | publisher = Toronto Star[/tpl]
Tarbox died at a hospital in Edmonton on May 18, 2003 at the age of 42 from brain cancer and lung cancer.
