[[List of counties in Nebraska]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of U.S. counties by state, Nebraska counties, Nebraska geography-related lists

The following is a list of the 93 counties in the U.S. state of Nebraska, listed by name, FIPS code and license plate prefix.
Nebraska's postal abbreviation is NE and its FIPS state code is 31.
When many counties were formed, the bills establishing them did not state the honoree's full name; thus the namesakes of several counties, including Brown, Deuel, Dixon, and possibly Harlan, are known only by their surnames.
