[[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]]

CATEGORIES: Education in Somerset County, Maine, Skowhegan, Maine

The Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture is a nine week summer artists residency located in Skowhegan, Maine.  The school was established in 1947 by Willard W. Cummings, Sidney Simon, Henry Varnum Poor and Charles Cutler.  The vision of these founding artists was to create an enduring community of artistic practice, learning and innovation governed by artists.
The school invites applicants to submit images of artwork, which are then judged by a jury of school governors and artists.  During the summer work period, artists are given studios and living accommodations.  Sixty-five participants are accepted each year, and are supported by a staff of twenty.  A fee of approximately $5000 is asked of the applicants, but scholarships and awards reduce the average paid significantly.  More than half of the participants received full scholarships, and only a handful pay the full fee.
Six established artists are resident on the campus, giving studio visits and criticism to the participants.  Additionally, six or seven more established artists will come for week-long visits, meeting with the students and giving more lectures.  Lectures are the 
only part of the program open to the public.
The School is unique in that it is one of the few institutions in the United States that teaches the technique of fresco.  In addition to teaching fresco, the school has a permanent collection of fresco work done by important contemporary artists.  Since 2010, N. Sean Glover has been the fresco instructor.
Even though the school offers instruction in the traditional art of fresco, it is not focused on 'traditional' art forms.  The participants are of a thoroughly contemporary bent; video art, computer art, sculpture, painting and everything in between can be found.  The school has an up-to-date computer lab, photographic printing facilities, and a sculpture shop.
