[[Interacting boson model]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear physics

The interacting boson model (IBM) is a model in nuclear physics in which
nucleons (protons or neutrons) pair up, essentially
acting as a single particle with boson properties, with
integral spin of 0, 2 or 4.
The IBM-I treats both types of nucleons the same and considers only pairs of nucleons coupled to
total angular momentum 0 and 2, called respectively, s and d bosons. 
The IBM-II treats protons and neutrons separately.

==History==

This model was invented by Akito Arima and Francesco Iachello.
