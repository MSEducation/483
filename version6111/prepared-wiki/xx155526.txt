Puzzle Play was an Australian pre-school themed TV show for young kids. It aired Monday to Friday from 8:30 am to 9:00 am on Network Ten. The program premiered on 21 December 2006 replacing the program In the Box. The hosts were Kellyn Morris, Liam Nunan and Patrick MacDonald. There was also Cassie (voiced by Kristen Souvlis) which was a computer with a female voice and Penny, a cartoon bus-like vehicle that took the hosts to various locations. Penny makes a beeping sound. The plot involved Cassie presenting a 4-piece puzzle with a shape on each piece. As the show continued, a clue was shown for each piece. Each clue was usually a video with a host narrating about the shape with information about it. The hosts visited schools, preschools, kindergartens and parks. As the pieces were being removed, a picture was revealed in the background and in the end the 3 hosts guessed what the picture was about. All the pieces were related to final picture.
Before the show was aired, it replaced the show "In the Box". Puzzle Play was replaced on 31 January 2011 by "Wurrawhy".
