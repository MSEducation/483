His father played defensive tackle for the University of Washington in the late 1970s, and was later drafted in the ninth round of the 1980 NFL Draft by the then-St. Louis Cardinals and later played for the Minnesota Vikings from 1987 to 1988.
From a young age, Mays always had a deep desire to play football; his father recalls Mays, at age 14, doing homework with his football helmet on.[tpl]cite news |first=Michael |last=Ko |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=O'Dea's Mays growing out of father's NFL shadow, headed to USC |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/hsfootballpreview/2002460028_webmays31.html |work=The Seattle Times |publisher= |date=August 31, 2005 |accessdate=January 21, 2008 [/tpl] Mays also spent a lot of time as a kid watching old football tapes from when his father played. While his parents initially didn't allow him to play football, he played soccer and was noted as being very physical and much bigger than the other kids which led to his parents eventually letting him try out for the football team in the 7th grade.[tpl]cite news |first=Mark |last=Saxon |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=USC's Mays returns home |url=http://www.ocregister.com/sports/mays-year-stafford-1852694-football-play |work=OCRegister |publisher= |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=January 21, 2008 [/tpl]

While considering offers from UCLA, Washington and Miami, Mays elected to commit to the University of Southern California after being recruited by defensive back coaches Rocky Seto and Greg Burns.  Mays was expected to attend Washington in the footsteps of his father, but didn't want to fall under his father's shadow and decided to build his own legacy while citing Pete Carroll's enthusiasm and coaching style as a major factor in his decision, officially committing on August 14, 2005.
He participated in the 2006 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.

==College career==

Mays received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Southern California, where he played for head coach Pete Carroll's USC Trojans football team from 2006 to 2009.

===2006 season===

Mays got the start at free safety his freshman year after Josh Pinkard went down with a season-ending injury in their first game against Arkansas. His first college career interception came in week 5 against Washington State. Throughout the year he was a solid safety recording 62 tackles in only 12 starts and an ended the year leading his team in interceptions with 3. In 2006, Mays became the third player in Trojan history to be named the Pac-10’s Co-Freshman of The Year while also earning Second-team All-American, 1st-team Freshman All-American and Defensive Freshman of the Year honors from Sporting News magazine.Milles, Todd, Road trip is trip home, The News Tribune, September 21, 2007.
Mays surprised a lot of people throughout the nation when it was stated by Pete Carroll that the 6'3", 230-pound freshman was the fastest player on a top-tier team built with some of the speediest players in the nation.[tpl]cite news |first=Bob |last=Condotta |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=UW Football Notebook – Carroll was key to Mays leaving |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/huskies/2003906338_uwfbnotes27.html |work=The Seattle Times |publisher= |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=January 21, 2008 [/tpl] Teammate running back Joe McKnight stated: "He's faster than me. I wish I had it, whatever he has." According to Carroll, Mays was clocked at an astonishing 4.25 in the [tpl]convert|40|yd|m|adj=on[/tpl] dash, .01 seconds slower than the record set at the 2008 NFL Combine by Tennessee Titans running back Chris Johnson. Mays also stated that he models his game after former USC safety and Pro Football Hall of Fame safety Ronnie Lott and the late Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor: "He's been my favorite player. I look up to (former USC safety) Ronnie Lott, too. That's what's special being in this program, living up to the safeties here."
Mays switched from No. 29 to No. 2 after his freshman season for former Florida State player Deion Sanders and former Michigan player Charles Woodson who both wore the number while playing defensive back in college.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=CBS CS: Taylor Made for Success |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbKBeI1uVtU |work=CBS Sports |publisher=YouTube |date=October 14, 2008 |accessdate=January 21, 2008 [/tpl]

===2007 season===

After Josh Pinkard was re-positioned to cornerback, Mays returned as the team's starting safety alongside All-Pac-10 strong safety Kevin Ellison, whom he credits as his mentor.[tpl]cite news |first=Gary |last=Klein |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Junior Taylor Mays says it's not senior night for him |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-uscfyi27-2008nov27,0,2745481.story |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher= |date=September 27, 2008 |accessdate=January 21, 2008 [/tpl] His most impressive game of the season came during week 10 against California, where he posted tackles (10) and deflected 3 passes which helped hold one of the best offenses in the nation 14 points below its average in the 24–17 win. He also had a career-high 12 tackles in week 8 against the Oregon.
Mays finished third on the team with 65 total tackles, 6 pass deflections, 1 forced fumble, and 1 interception in 13 games in 2007. He earned Third-team All-American honors from the Associated Press, First-team All-American honors from Sporting News, and All-Pac-10 honorable mention.
After the 2007 season, Mays was listed by ESPN The Magazine in an article titled "Workout Warriors", honoring college football's most physically talented players. According to the article, in the USC spring practices in 2008, Mays posted unbelievable numbers:  Measured at 6' 3", 226-pounds with 6% body fat, Mays ran an electronically-timed 4.32 40-yard dash, threw up 225-pounds 23 times during the bench press, and recorded a 41" vertical jump and an 11' 4" standing broad jump. When he arrived at USC, Mays weighed 215-pounds, posted a 35" vertical and 10' standing broad jump. Mays was listed at the No. 2 spot behind Texas defensive end Brian Orakpo.Feldman, Bruce, College football's top workout warriors, ESPN The Magazine, June 9, 2008. Retrieved June 9, 2008.

===2008 season===

Before the start of the 2008 season, Mays was honored with a 2008 Preseason All-American selection and was on the early watch list for both the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, awarded to the best defensive player in the nation, and the Lott Trophy. Mays stated in a Los Angeles Times interview on November 10 that he would decide whether or not to forfeit his senior year at USC to enter the 2009 NFL Draft after the 2008 post season, saying that a big factor in his decision would come from his father and head coach Pete Carroll[tpl]cite news |first=Gary |last=Klein |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=USC safety Taylor Mays puts off decisions on future |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-uscfyi11-2008nov11,0,5109364.story |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher= |date=November 11, 2008 |accessdate= [/tpl] Mays entered 2008 as one of the nation's top safety prospects in the nation.
The USC defense turned in the second-best defense in the nation and some argued one of the best college has ever seen. Through the air, the USC defense held opposing offenses to only 6 touchdowns while collecting 19 interceptions as the best pass defense in the nation with Mays being a key factor in their success.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Final 2008 NCAA FBS Pass Efficiency Defense Statistics  |url=http://statistics.ncaafootball.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=ncaa-football&page=cfoot/stat/ncaa-team-passing-eff.htm |work=NCAAFootball |publisher= |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2008 [/tpl] Though he didn't register an interception throughout his junior season, Mays had a team-leading 8 pass deflections with four of them coming in a week 9 matchup against California who averaged almost 40 points per game to that point. Mays had a spectacular performance in the game delivering several big hits in the game which jarred balls loose from the receiver's hands. What would have been Mays' first interception of the season was called back on a penalty by Kaluka Maiava.[tpl]cite news |first=Paul |last=Peszko |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=USC-Cal Bears: Defense, Penalties, and Botched Calls  |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/79328-usc-cal-bears-defense-penalties-and-botched-calls/show_full |work=Bleacher Report |publisher= |date=November 8, 2008 |accessdate=January 21, 2009 [/tpl] Through regular season play, Mays collected 53 total tackles and 8 pass deflections. The Trojans would go on to face Penn State in the 2009 Rose Bowl where the defense shut down one of the most explosive offenses in the country in the 38–24 win. A memorable play in the game by Taylor Mays was a devastating helmet-to-helmet hit on wide receiver Jordan Norwood which momentarily knocked Norwood out of the game and incidentally his teammate Kevin Thomas as well.
Mays ended his junior season as a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award after being beaten out by Ohio State cornerback Malcolm Jenkins. He finished 3rd in the running, coming in behind Jenkins and Tennessee safety Eric Berry. He earned First-team All-American honors from several sources such as Sporting News, Walter Camp Football and the Associated Press as well as Second-Team All-American honors by Rivals.com and All-Pac-10 First-team honors.
On January 13, two days before the deadline for college players to declare for the Draft, Mays announced that he would return to USC for his last year. Mays was regarded as unanimous first-round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft but opted to return to continue to develop and to complete his education at Southern California, citing the importance of graduating to himself and his parents as well as giving his last shot at leading USC to the BCS National Championship.Klein, Gary, Taylor Mays to return to USC, Los Angeles Times, January 13, 2009.

===2009 season===

In a Lindy's Football article, Mays stated that he wanted to play a different role in the defensive secondary that would call him to be more involved in the action. "I want to be closer to the action. People who know football know what my role on the defense is, but I'd like to be more involved this season," Mays said. The usual duties of a free safety in Pete Carroll's defense calls for him to be a center fielder preventing plays being made deep downfield, keeping him from doing much else in the box. Carroll said he agreed to tweak Mays' duties for the 2009 season, Mays' last at USC. In his last season with the Trojans, one ending with the roughest record (8–4) of his 4-year tenure at USC, he tallied a career-high 96 total tackles for the season while adding another interception to his career total.[tpl]cite web|author=Taylor Mays  #2  S |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=183232 |title=Taylor Mays Stats, News, Photos – USC Trojans – NCAA College Football |publisher=ESPN  |date=February 7, 1988 |accessdate=May 12, 2010[/tpl]

After spending the entirety of the first three games on special teams, coach Mike Singletary benched then-starting strong safety Lewis in favor of Reggie Smith and Mays who split time at the spot in the team's Week 4 match-up against the Atlanta Falcons. While garnering a team-high 11 tackles in the game, Mays' most outstanding play of the game was a special teams touchdown made off of a deflected punt.
