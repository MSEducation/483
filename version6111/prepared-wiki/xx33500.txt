They both are Dieva dēli ("sons of God"), and are thus confused with each other and with other male deities. Auseklis is the groom of Saules meita ("daughter of the sun"). Despite this Auseklis is often referred to as being very young.

==Auseklis as a symbol==

Auseklis is also the name of eight-pointed star (a regular octagram). It is also known as one of the crosses of Lietuvēns (an evil spirit). The other being the pentagram, which symbolizes Venus in other cultures. Thus, both signs could have been symbols of Auseklis, originally used for protection against evil spirits. Later, the pentagram became a symbol of evil spirits. Both signs had to be drawn without lifting the hand. In 1980s the octagram became the symbol of the third Latvian National Awakening.
