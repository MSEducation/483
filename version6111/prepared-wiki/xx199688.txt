==History==

The William Ritzman House was built in around 1847 by settler William Ritzman, originally from Union County, Pennsylvania. Ritzman was a lieutenant during the Mexican War and eventually became one of Orangeville's leading citizens. Beginning in 1974 the house underwent a restoration that lasted more than 25 years and returned the house to its original state.Buford, John C.

==Architecture==

The Greek Revival Ritzman House was built by an unknown contractor during a time period when Greek Revival style was becoming popular in the Midwest. The brick Ritzman House incorporates several elements common to Greek Revival structures including: a low-pitch gable roof, cornice lines with a wide trim band, and an elaborate door surround with a narrow transom line and sidelights. The Ritzman House belongs to a class of Greek Revival homes that lack front porches, this occurs in about 20 percent of residential Greek Revival architecture.
