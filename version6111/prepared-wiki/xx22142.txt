[[Business administration]]

CATEGORIES: Administration, Business, Project management

The administration of a business  includes the performance or management of business operations and decision making as well as the efficient organization of people and other resources to direct activities toward common goals and objectives.
The word is derived from the Middle English word [tpl]lang|enm|administracioun[/tpl], which came from the French [tpl]lang|fr|administration[/tpl], itself derived from the Latin [tpl]lang|la|administratio[/tpl] â€” a compounding of [tpl]lang|la|ad[/tpl] ("to") and [tpl]lang|la|ministrare[/tpl] ("give service").
Administrator is occasionally the title of the general manager or company secretary who reports to a corporate board of directors. This usage is archaic [tpl]cn|date=October 2013[/tpl]. In general, administration refers to the broader management function, including the associated finance, personnel and MIS services.
In some organizational analyses, management is viewed as a subset of administration, specifically associated with the technical and operational aspects of an organization, distinct from executive or strategic functions. Alternatively, administration can refer to the bureaucratic or operational performance of routine office tasks, usually internally oriented and reactive rather than proactive. Administrators, broadly speaking, engage in a common set of functions to meet the organization's goals. These "functions" of the administrator were described by Henri Fayol as "the five elements of administration". Sometimes creating output, which includes all of the processes that create the product that the business sells, is added as a sixth element.
