[[1500]]

CATEGORIES: 1500

Year 1500 (MD) was a leap year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar.
The year was seen as being especially important by many Christians in Europe, who thought it would bring the beginning of the end of the world. Their belief was based on the phrase "half-time after the time", when the apocalypse was due to occur, which appears in the Book of Revelation and was seen as referring to 1500.Andrew Graham-Dixon, Art of Germany, BBC, 2011[tpl]request quotation|date=April 2012[/tpl]
