He has also written for numerous publications including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, New York Magazine, Penthouse, Los Angeles Magazine, and Barron's Magazine, where his discussion of the Michael Milken Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond situation, as well as the ethical dimensions of management buyouts, attracted heavy US national attention in the 1980s and 1990s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl] He wrote a regular biweekly column for Yahoo!

Stein was fired from his position as a Sunday Business columnist at The New York Times in August 2009, due to a policy prohibiting writers from performing product endorsements or advertising. Stein had recently become an advertising spokesperson for credit information company FreeScore.com, and according to a Times statement, had assumed there would be no conflict provided that he did not discuss credit scoring in general or FreeScore.com itself in his column. However, the publication felt that it would be inappropriate for him to write for them while he was involved in advertising, and terminated his contract.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5331835/pitchman-ben-stein-gets-economist-ben-stein-fired-at-the-new-york-times |title=Pitchman Ben Stein Gets Economist Ben Stein Fired at the New York Times |publisher=Gawker.com |date=August 6, 2009 |accessdate=August 1, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100718215141/http://gawker.com/5331835/pitchman-ben-stein-gets-economist-ben-stein-fired-at-the-new-york-times| archivedate= July 18, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Writing in The Spectator, Stein states his belief that the real reasons for his firing were budget cuts at the Times, his criticism of President Obama, and pressure from those critical of Expelled, who "bamboozled some of the high pooh-bahs at the Times into thinking there was a conflict of interest".[tpl]cite web|last=Stein |first=Ben |url=http://spectator.org/archives/2009/08/10/expelled-from-the-new-york-tim/1 |title=The American Spectator: Expelled From the New York Times |publisher=Spectator.org |date= |accessdate=August 1, 2010[/tpl]
Stein is currently an in-house journalist at Newsmax Magazine, a magazine by the conservative media group, Newsmax Media.

===Political career===

Stein began his political career as a speechwriter and lawyer for President Richard Nixon, and later for President Gerald Ford. On May 3, 1976, Time magazine speculated on the possibility of Stein having actually been Deep Throat. Stein responded over the years by not only denying he was Deep Throat, but by going further and accusing journalist Bob Woodward of falsifying the famous secret source. In the May 14–21, 1998 edition of the Philadelphia City Paper, Stein is quoted saying, "Oh, I don't think there was a Deep Throat. That was a fake. I think there were several different sources and some they just made up."Interview by Brian Howard: "20 Questions: Ben Stein" Philadelphia City Paper May 1998 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl] After Mark Felt's identity as Deep Throat was revealed, Stein stated that Richard Nixon would have prevented the rise to power of the Khmer Rouge if he had not been forced to resign. For his actions leading to that resignation, Stein said: [tpl]bquote|If there is such a thing as karma, if there is such a thing as justice in this life or the next, Mark Felt has bought himself the worst future of any man on this earth. And Bob Woodward is right behind him, with Ben Bradlee bringing up the rear. Out of their smug arrogance and contempt, they hatched the worst nightmare imaginable: genocide.Stein, Ben: "Deep Throat and Genocide", "The American Spectator", June 1, 2005[/tpl]
In 2005, Stein said in the American Spectator:

On June 24, 2008, Stein received the Freedom of Expression Award at the Entertainment Merchants Association’s Home Entertainment Awards for "his outspoken economic and political beliefs."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.homemediaexpo.com/hmexpo/v42/press.cvn?id=11&p_id=23|title=This Time Ben Stein Wins!|last=Lee|first=Grace|date=June 10, 2008|accessdate=June 1, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090601205002/http://www.homemediaexpo.com/hmexpo/v42/press.cvn?id=11&p_id=23| archivedate= June 1, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Career in the media===

Stein became a Hollywood consultant before he moved into acting. His film career was launched by his performance as the monotonous economics teacher in the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. In one scene, he gives an unscripted economics lecture, relying on his own experience in economics. The topics covered in his lecture are the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930 and the then-current debate over supply-side economics. The film's director John Hughes told him to speak about something he knew well.http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0104807/quotes  The only scripted lines are those in which he calls attendance, repeating "Bueller?...Bueller?" in a monotone voice.
Stein played similarly bland and unemotional characters. He had a recurring role in the TV series The Wonder Years and played himself in Dave.
He also appeared in several television commercials, most notably for the product "Clear Eyes" throughout the 1990s and 2000s (decade) ("The difference is clear...Clear Eyes." "Clear Eyes, Wow!")—many ads spoof movies of the day, such as one where Stein is a painter (a play on The Da Vinci Code). Before this, he appeared for a Godfather's Pizza ad in 1987 and as a bland science teacher in a 1990 ad for Sprinkled Chips Ahoy Cookies. In 2013, Stein began appearing in commercials for small business accounting service firm 1800Accountant.
In 1997, Stein was given his own game show by Comedy Central titled Win Ben Stein's Money along with co-host Jimmy Kimmel (replaced by Nancy Pimental and later by Sal Iacono). True to its name, the money that contestants won on the show was subtracted from the $5,000 pay that Stein earned per episode (in addition to his salary). The show won five Daytime Emmy Awards before ending its run in 2003.
In 1999, during the height of Win Ben Stein's Money's popularity, Comedy Central gave Stein another show, a talk show with celebrity guests entitled Turn Ben Stein On. One of the mainstays of the show was Stein's dog, Puppy Wuppy, who had free run of the set.
Other movies and television shows in which Ben Stein has appeared include Charles in Charge; Seinfeld; Full House; Casper; Casper: A Spirited Beginning; Casper Meets Wendy; The Mask and its sequel, Son of the Mask as well as the TV show, The Mask: The Animated Series; Earthworm Jim; Star Search; MacGyver; Richie Rich; Game Show Moments Gone Bananas; Cavuto on Business; The O'Reilly Factor; CBS News Sunday Morning; Planes, Trains and Automobiles; Family Guy; the Michael Berger-hosted version of Match Game; Fairly Odd Parents; Duckman; Married... with Children; The Emperor's New School; My Girl 2; Ghostbusters; Ghostbusters II and the intelligent design documentary Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed.Expelled Press Release
In addition, Stein's voice roles include The Pixies, magical creatures on the animated series The Fairly OddParents; Mr. Purutu on the animated series The Emperor's New School; Professor Wisenstein in Bruno the Kid; the birthday party clown, Mr. Giggles, on The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius; a bingo caller on Rugrats; and Pip on Animaniacs, as well as the narrator of the Animaniacs' movie Wakko's Wish. Stein also voiced a psychiatrist, again named after himself, in the USA TV series Duckman; he once appeared in the sitcom Married... with Children as a receptionist in the animal afterlife. He also made a cameo appearance in the comic book Young Justice, as Ali Ben Styn. Another cameo appearance was as Rabbi Goldberg in the Family Guy episodes "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein" and "Family Goy". Stein also voiced the character Sam Schmaltz in the 1996 computer adventure game Toonstruck.
In addition, Stein has written for the television industry, including outlines for the TV movie Murder in Mississippi and for the lengthy ABC miniseries Amerika. He has also contributed to the creation of the well-liked TV comedy Fernwood 2 Night.
Stein hosted a show on VH1 called America's Most Smartest Model.[tpl]IMDb title|1055400[/tpl] The show aimed to find the smartest among fourteen models through a series of challenges.reality blurred + VH1 plans America's Most Smartest Model, The Salt-N-Pepa Show, Danny Bonaduce's Child Star, and Click!
On May 14, 2006, during an appearance on the Fox News program Your World with Neil Cavuto, Stein called for a tax increase of 3.5% for wealthy Americans, to be earmarked for soldiers and military initiatives. Stein wrote an editorial for The New York Times critical of those who would rather make money in the world of finance than fight terrorism.Stein, Ben: "Looking for the Will Beyond the Battlefield", "New York Times", August 20, 2006
On December 28, 2009, Stein appeared on CNN's Larry King Live with Dr. Ron Paul to discuss the attempted bombing of an American plane on Christmas Day 2009. Stein said that Dr. Paul's stance that the United States were "occupiers" in Iraq and Afghanistan "is the same anti-Semitic argument we've heard over and over again."Ben Stein says Ron Paul uses anti-semetic arguments "The New American", December 29, 2009 The comment started a shouting match between the two men and prompted anger from Dr. Paul's supporters and those who believe Stein went too far in calling Paul's argument anti-Semitic.Win Ben Stein's Apology "Young Americans for Liberty", December 29, 2009 Stein issued an apology on December 30, 2009.A Ron Paul Moment "The American Spectator" December 30, 2009
He is an occasional political and economics commentator on CNBC's Kudlow & Company.

===Financial and economic commentary===

In the period preceding the Late-2000s recession, Stein made frequent and vehement claims that the economy was not in recession, and that the issues in the housing market would not affect the broader economy. On March 18, 2007, in a column for CBS News' online version of CBS News Sunday Morning, Stein famously proclaimed in the beginning of the subprime mortgage crisis that the foreclosure problem would "blow over and the people who buy now, in due time, will be glad they did," the economy was "still very strong," and the "smart money" was "now trying to buy — not sell — as much distressed merchandise" in mortgages as possible.Stein, Ben:"Ben Stein Says Economy Is Fine, Says Don't Worry About Foreclosure Blues, The Mortgage Market Is Robust","CBS News", March 18, 2007
In an August 12, 2007 column in the New York Times titled "Chicken Little’s Brethren, on the Trading Floor", Stein, while acknowledging "I don’t know where the bottom is on subprime. I don’t know how bad the problems are at Bear (Bear Stearns)" claimed that "subprime losses are wildly out of all proportion to the likely damage to the economy from the subprime problems," and "(t)his economy is extremely strong. Profits are superb. The world economy is exploding with growth. To be sure, terrible problems lurk in the future: a slow-motion dollar crisis, huge Medicare deficits and energy shortages. But for now, the sell-off seems extreme, not to say nutty. Some smart, brave people will make a fortune buying in these days, and then we’ll all wonder what the scare was about."Stein, Ben. "Chicken Little’s Brethren, on the Trading Floor." The New York Times, August 12, 2007.http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/business/yourmoney/12every.html
On August 18, 2007, on Fox News Channel's Cavuto on Business, Stein appeared with other financial experts dismissing worries of a coming credit crunch."Fox News recap August 18, 2007", http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,293819,00.html Thirteen months later, in the Global Financial Crisis of September 2008, global stock markets crashed, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken over by the US government, AIG was bailed out by the Federal Reserve, Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America Corporation, and Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs confirmed that they would become traditional bank holding companies.
In a Yahoo! Finance article written on October 17, 2008, Stein explained that his understanding of the debt obligations based on real estate loans was less than the "staggeringly large" amount of obligations that were created through trade in derivatives of those, and so why it wasn't as similar to collapse of junk bond empire in early 1990s as he'd thought it would be: "Where I missed the boat was not realizing how large were the CDS default swaps based on the junk mortgage bonds."[tpl]cite web|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/expert/article/yourlife/115733 |title=Yahoo!

Business commentator Henry Blodget wrote a piece for Business Insider in January 2008 entitled "Ben Stein is an Idiot," stating that Stein's criticism of those with bearish views and positions on the market was either "delusional," or a deliberate and "shrewd" attempt to create false controversy and drive up web traffic.Blodget, Henry.

===Larry Craig scandal===

In 2007, Stein chastised the police and the GOP leadership for their response to the Larry Craig scandal. Stein said that Craig's sexuality should not be an issue: "A party that believes in individual rights should be rallying to his defense, not making him walk the plank."Ben Stein Says Craig Was Lynched Twice CBS News

===Tax code===

Stein has criticized the U.S. tax code for being too lenient on the wealthy. He has repeated the observation made by Warren Buffett, one of the richest individuals in the world (who pays mostly capital gains tax), that Buffett pays a lower overall tax rate than his secretaries (who pay income taxes and payroll taxes). Stein has advocated increasing taxation on the wealthy.Stein, Ben. In Class Warfare, Guess Which Class Is Winning. New York Times. November 26, 2006.  However, in 2010, after Obama proposed not extending tax cuts for the highest earning taxpayers, Stein stated he was being punished, saying: "But for what? I don't own slaves. I employ a lot of people full- and part-time and they are all happy with their pay. When charity calls, I almost always write out a check. I don't have a yacht or ponies or a plane. My wife doesn't wear a tiara.

===Dominique Strauss-Kahn===

When IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn was arrested for sexual assault and attempted rape in 2011, Stein published a controversial editorial "Presumed Innocent, Anyone?" in The American Spectator in which he closely scrutinized Strauss-Kahn's accuser and cited Strauss-Kahn's education, wealth, and position as reasons to believe he was unlikely to have committed the crime.[tpl]bquote|In life, events tend to follow patterns.

===Theory of evolution===

Stein has denounced the scientific theory of evolution, which he and other intelligent design advocates call "Darwinism", declaring it to be "a painful, bloody chapter in the history of ideologies", "the most compelling argument yet for Imperialism", and the inspiration for the Holocaust."Better Than We Deserve", American Spectator 2007 Dec.[tpl]cite news | first=John | last=Rennie | coauthors= | title=Ben Stein's Expelled: No Integrity Displayed | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=ben-steins-expelled-review-john-rennie | work =Scientific American | pages = | accessdate = April 12, 2008 | language = [/tpl] Stein does not say belief in evolution alone leads to genocide, but that scientific materialism is a necessary component."Ben Stein's Diary #60: From Boston To Berlin", American Spectator 2007 Sep., https://www.spectator.org/digspec_mag_Sept07.asp[tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl] He co-wrote and stars in Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, a film that aims to persuade viewers that evolution was instrumental to the rise of the eugenics movement, Nazi Germany, and the Holocaust, and portrays advocates of intelligent design as victims of intellectual discrimination by the scientific community, which has rejected intelligent design as creationist pseudoscience."This is propaganda, a political rant disguised as a serious commentary on stifled freedom of inquiry."

The media response to the film has been largely unfavorable. It received a 10% meta-score from Rotten Tomatoes. Multiple reviews, including those of USA Today and Scientific American, have described the film as propaganda.
In a Trinity Broadcasting Network interview with Paul Crouch Jr. regarding Stein's movie, Stein made the following statement about science and religion:[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/162377/science-equals-murder/john-derbyshire | title=Science Equals Murder | work=National Review | date=30 April 2008 | accessdate=11 March 2014 | author=Derbyshire, John[/tpl]
 Stein: When we just saw that man, I think it was Mr. Myers, talking about how great scientists were, I was thinking to myself the last time any of my relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get gassed ... that was horrifying beyond words, and that’s where science—in my opinion, this is just an opinion—that’s where science leads you. 
 Crouch: That’s right. 
 Stein: ... Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people. 
 Crouch: Good word, good word. 
It should be pointed out however that before this he did several times declare his "utmost admiration" for science and scientists. He later confirmed that he meant to imply that "uncontrolled evolutioniary ideas can lead to this"
The Anti-Defamation League issued a statement condemning the film's misuse of the Holocaust and its imagery, "Using the Holocaust in order to tarnish those who promote the theory of evolution is outrageous and trivializes the complex factors that led to the mass extermination of European Jewry".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/HolNa_52/5277_52.htm | title=Anti-Evolution Film Misappropriates the Holocaust  | publisher=Anti-Defamation League |date= April 29, 2008  | first= | last=  | accessdate =April 30, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080501051535/http://www.adl.org/PresRele/HolNa_52/5277_52.htm| archivedate= May 1, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
At the University of Vermont, Stein was invited to receive an honorary degree and be the commencement speaker for the graduating class of 2009.
