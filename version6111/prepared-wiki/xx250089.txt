A small boy runs as fast as he can through a pitch-dark forest. Blinded by fear, the kid runs across a forest road without seeing the trailer truck coming.

He soon realizes that he can't outrun his past. Various visions of past haunt the protagonist as he visits his ancestral house. At one point he decides to burn the house, but is deferred by the local police women. In the final cathresis of the protagonist he pushes his diabolic half burned brother Peter off the waterfall. In the end: Police arrests KK for various murders which seem to have been committed by the alter ego Peter.
