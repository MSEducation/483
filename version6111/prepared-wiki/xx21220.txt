==History==

Homestar Runner was brought to life in Atlanta in 1996 by University of Georgia[tpl]Cite news| last = Aucoin | first = Dan | coauthors = | title = Lookin' At A Thing In A Bag | work = The Boston Globe | pages = C1  | publisher = The Boston Globe |date=9 August 2003 | url = | accessdate = 2006-12-25[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| last = Strick | first = Jacob | authorlink = | coauthors = Samuel Strick | title = Homestar Runner Interview | work = | publisher = Penguin Brothers |date=26 May 2003 | url = http://www.penguinbros.com/interviews/homestarrunner.html | doi = | accessdate = 2006-12-25 [/tpl][tpl]Cite web| last = Chinsang | first = Wayne | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Homestar Runner's The Brothers Chaps | work = Tastes Like Chicken | publisher = Tastes Like Chicken |date=June 2003 | url = http://www.tlchicken.com/view_story.php?ARTid=1374 | format = | doi =|accessdate = 2006-12-25 [/tpl] student Mike Chapman and his friend Craig Zobel, who were working summer jobs surrounding the 1996 Summer Olympics. On a day off, they visited a bookstore where they found that the state of children's books was dismal.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] Intending to parody this, they wrote the original story The Homestar Runner Enters the Strongest Man in the World Contest.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.homestarrunner.com/book1.html |title=The Homestar Runner Enters the Strongest Man in the World Contest |accessdate=2006-12-19 |author=Chapman, Mike |authorlink=The Brothers Chaps |coauthors=Zobel, Craig |work=homestarrunner.com |year=1996[/tpl] This story featured Homestar Runner, Pom Pom, Strong Bad, The Cheat, and a few characters that are rarely seen in later cartoons: The Robot, Mr. Bland, Señor, and the Grape Fairie. This hand-drawn book was the only incarnation of the characters for several years.
They later used Mario Paint, a Super Nintendo video game, to create the first cartoon of the series.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.homestarrunner.com/supernes.swf |title=Super NES |accessdate=2007-01-03 |work=homestarrunner.com |format=SWF |year=1996[/tpl] By 1999, Mike and his younger brother Matt Chapman, who call themselves The Brothers Chaps, were learning Flash and looking for something on which to practice.[tpl]Cite web| author=Scott, Kevin| date=May 20, 2003| title=The Homestar Runner Interview | work=Kevin's Spot| url=http://members.shaw.ca/kevinscott/Homestar/index.html|accessdate=2006-05-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051222112111/http://members.shaw.ca/kevinscott/Homestar/index.html  |archivedate = 2005-12-22[/tpl] Digging out the old children's book provided a solution. The site domain was registered on December 6, 1999, and around the start of the year 2000, homestarrunner.com was live. Matt provided the voices of the male characters, while Mike's girlfriend (now wife) Missy Palmer provided Marzipan's voice.
Regarding the origin of the name "Homestar Runner", Matt had this to say, from an interview with Kevin Scott:
The friend mentioned is James Huggins (band member of Of Montreal), who was a childhood friend of the Chapman brothers while growing up in Atlanta (Dunwoody).[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
From January 2000 - February 2001,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/homestar-runner/images/37785/title/homestar-runner-evolution-photo | title=Homestar Runner Evolution Photo | publisher=Fanpop | date=2012|accessdate=2013-05-26 | author=Temptasia[/tpl] the website and cartoons started out with different art styles.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.homestarrunner.com/oldflash.html | title=The Original Website! | publisher=Homestar Runner | date=1-1-00|accessdate=2013-05-26 | author=The Brothers Chaps[/tpl] In February 2001, it gained a new look, which has been used ever since.
The site grew slowly at first, but by mid-2001 it began to take off with the first Strong Bad Email. The number of visitors to the site grew, and by January 2003 the site had outgrown its original web host, Yahoo!. Merchandise sales paid for all of the costs of running the website as well as living costs of the creators, whose retired parents managed many of the business aspects.[tpl]Cite web| author=Meinheit, Matt| date=April 23, 2004| title=Holy crap | work=The Daily Eastern News | url=http://www.dennews.com/media/paper309/news/2004/04/23/TheVerge/holy-Crap-669677.shtml | accessdate=2006-08-18[/tpl]
On January 30, 2006, Podstar Runner was launched, allowing people to download select Strong Bad Emails and other toon episodes to a video-enabled portable media player (such as an iPod). Once made available through iTunes' podcast directory, it very quickly took the #1 slot on Apple's "Most Popular" podcast list. Podstar Runner was taken down on September 21, 2007, for reasons unknown. A new version was introduced on Thursday, January 10, 2008, but it is no longer available at the iTunes Store or Zune Marketplace.

===Collaborations with other artists===

The Brothers Chaps have partnered up with rock band They Might Be Giants and supplied animation for a music video of their song "Experimental Film".[tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.homestarrunner.com/expfilm.html | title = Experimental Film | publisher = homestarrunner.com | author = Chapman, Matt; Chapman, Mike | accessdate = 2007-01-03[/tpl] The creators of Homestar Runner spent time with the band and those songs have found their way onto the website in the form of "Puppet Jam," a subset of "Puppet Stuff," where Puppet Homestar rocks out with TMBG.[tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.homestarrunner.com/puppetjam1.html | publisher = homestarrunner.com | title = Puppet Jam: Bad Jokes|author = Chapman, Matt; Chapman, Mike | accessdate = January 3, 2007 [/tpl] TMBG also wrote the music for Strong Bad Email #99, "Different Town.", and on the 200th Strong Bad Email, the band wrote and vocalized the intro song.
[tpl]Cite web| url = http://theymightbegiants.com/news.htm | publisher = TMBG | title = TMBG-News | accessdate = January 3, 2007 [/tpl] Another group, The Skate Party, helped The Brothers Chaps create "The Cheat Theme Song."[tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.homestarrunner.com/cheatvideo.html | title = The Cheat Theme Song | publisher = homestarrunner.com | author = The Skate Party; Chapman, Matt; Chapman, Mike | accessdate = 2007-02-02[/tpl] The band Y-O-U helped with the Strong Bad Sings and Other Type Hits CD, as well as on the strongbad_email.exe DVDs. The Brothers Chaps also employed the services of the a cappella band DaVinci's Notebook to create a theme song for the old-timey version of The Cheat, called "Ballad of The Sneak".[tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.homestarrunner.com/sneakvideo.html | publisher = homestarrunner.com| title = Ballad of the Sneak| accessdate = March 20, 2007 [/tpl] Matt Chapman provided guest vocals as Strong Bad on The Aquabats' "Pink Pants!" from their 2011 album, Hi-Five Soup!.  Strong Bad's voice also appears on Shellac's "Genuine Lulabelle" off the album "Excellent Italian Greyhound" from 2007.
Discussing how he and his sibling decide which projects to work on, Mike Chapman said, "We learned how to politely say no to things that were going to affect our lives negatively. If it’s going to be fun, if we’re going to enjoy doing it, and if the end project is going to be something we want to have happen, we say yes."

===Reception===

In 2003, the site received several million hits a month, and almost a thousand emails a day.[tpl]Cite news| first=Mandy | last=Jenkins | pages= | title=Cult is chasing wacky Web toon |date=August 1, 2003 | publisher=Cincinnati Enquirer | url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/08/01/tem_homestar01.html[/tpl] According to Matt Chapman, the site did no advertising, but grew on word of mouth and endorsements: "Certain bands, like fairly popular bands and stuff would link us on their site and, you know we were Shockwave site of the day a couple of times over the years." Homestar Runner[tpl]'s[/tpl] popularity, coupled with its positive critical response, has led to the website receiving widespread coverage. Homestar Runner has been featured in Wired, National Review, Entertainment Weekly, Total Gamer, G4, and NPR's All Things Considered.[tpl]Cite news| first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Strong Bad Walks in Footsteps of Darth, Lex, J.R. | date=2004-05-08 | publisher=NPR | url =http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4634837 | work =All Things Considered |  accessdate = 2007-11-09 [/tpl]
A review published in National Review characterized the site's humor as having
"the innocence of slapstick with sharp satire of American popular culture"—humor that "tends to be cultural, not political."[tpl]Cite news| first=Peter | last=Wood | pages= | title=Everybody to the Limit |date=August 27, 2003 | publisher=National Review|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-wood082703.asp[/tpl]

===Hiatus===

Since December 2009, updates to the Homestar Runner website have been sparse. In 2010, new cartoons were released only for the April Fools' Day and Decemberween holidays (skipping, for the first time in the site's history, the annual Halloween cartoon). The last new Strong Bad Email, "Videography", was posted on October 5, 2009.[ref]
