==Career==

===QPR===

When manager Gerry Francis moved to Queens Park Rangers from Bristol Rovers in 1991, a number of Rovers players later followed him to the London club. Yates was one of these, when he joined in August 1993. He made his debut that month against Liverpool.

===Tranmere Rovers===

Yates played 134 league games for Queens Park Rangers scoring 2 goals before transferring to Tranmere Rovers in 1999. Yates was a cult hero at Tranmere, where he became a certified 'goal machine' and he is best remembered for scoring two goals in a Merseyside derby against Everton at Goodison Park when Tranmere dumped out the Premier League outfit 3-0 in the 2000-01 FA Cup. Yates stayed there up until 2002 when he transferred to Sheffield United. Whilst at Tranmere he played in the 2000 Football League Cup Final, coming on as a substitute in the final against Leicester City.

===Huddersfield Town===

Yates joined Huddersfield in 2003 on a free after a successful trial period. He was also Peter Jackson's first signing as Huddersfield's manager for the second time. He scored his only goal for Huddersfield against Leyton Orient where he could have bagged another two. During a fixture with Carlisle United Yates had a bust-up in the tunnel, at the Galpharm Stadium, with opposing player Richie Foran which resulted in a red card for both parties involved and Yates losing his front tooth. Yates decided to retire in mid-2005.

===Scarborough & Halifax===

Yates came out of retirement in January 2006 to play just 1 game for Scarborough. He then transferred to Halifax Town where he played 3 games and left at the end of the 2005-2006 season.

===Morecambe===

In May 2006, Morecambe snapped Yates up on a free transfer and played 8 games for the Shrimps. Soccerbase incorrectly state that Yates played 44 games and scored 2 goals during the 2006-2007 season but research has shown that Yates signed for Caernarfon Town in September 2006 by his ex-playing colleague Kenny Irons.

===Caernarfon Town===

Yates played only two games for Caernarfon Town. The rest of his spell at the club he was sidelined with injury.
