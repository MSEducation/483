Helmet stickers, also known as reward decals and pride stickers, are stickers that are affixed to a high school or college football player's helmet. They can denote either individual or team accomplishments.

==History==

The practice of awarding helmet stickers is often credited to Ernie Biggs, trainer at Ohio State under legendary coach Woody Hayes. But as recently shown on ESPN, the practice of awarding stickers has been credited to Jim Young, former assistant coach at Miami in 1965, two years before they were used by the Buckeyes.
An even earlier attribution is given to Gene Stauber, freshman coach at Nebraska (1955-1957) by head coach Pete Elliott.http://www.huskermax.com/interviews/Pete_Elliott.html Stauber routinely used stickers throughout his tenure as assistant coach at Illinois (1960-1970), as a 1962 photo of All-American linebacker Dick Butkus indicates.http://www.fanbase.com/photo/1145757 The stickers stem from fighter pilots marking their planes with stickers after kills and/or successful missions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2006-10-26-helmet-stickers_x.htm |title=Helmet stickers reward college football players' superior performance |author=Rabjohns, Jeff |date=2006-10-26 |work=USA Today |publisher=USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Co.
