[[AMAP]]

CATEGORIES: Bioinformatics software, Bioinformatics

AMAP is a  multiple sequence alignment program based on a new approach to multiple alignment called sequence annealing. This approach consists of building up the multiple alignment one match at a time, thereby circumventing many of the problems of progressive alignment. The AMAP parameters can be used to tune the sensivitiy-specificity tradeoff.
The program can be used through the AMAP web server or as a standalone program which can be installed with the source code.

==Input/Output==

This program accepts sequences in FASTA format.
The output format includes: FASTA format, Clustal.
