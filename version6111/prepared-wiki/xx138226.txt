[[Ankober (woreda)]]

CATEGORIES: Amhara Region, Districts of Ethiopia

Ankober is one of the woredas in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Located at the eastern edge of the Ethiopian highlands in the Semien Shewa Zone, Ankober is bordered on the south by Asagirt, on the west by Basona Werana, on the north by Termaber, and on the east by the Afar Region. Towns in Ankober include Aliyu Amba, Ankober, Gorgo and Haramba.
Roads in this Ankober include one built in June 1985 to link the village of Dinki with the rest of the woreda, as part of a "Food-for-Work" program to help victims of the 1984-1985 famine. Until the road was completed, Dinki could only be reached by a two-day mule ride from Debre Berhan down steep mountain slopes. Three years after the road had been completed, two water mills had been established at the village, as well as new fruit plantations and the traditional cotton spinning and weaving industry had been revived.Patrick Webb and Joachim von Braun, Famine and Food Security in Ethiopia: Lessons for Africa (Chichester: John Wiley and Sons, 1994), pp. 60, 107, 113f
