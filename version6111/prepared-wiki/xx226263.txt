Live at the Britt Festival is a live album by Michael Nesmith, released in 1999. It was recorded live at the Britt Festival in Jacksonville, OR, on June 19, 1992.  To prepare for the concert, Nesmith conducted a limited U.S. tour which featured a similar set list as the Britt Festival.
The performance was Nesmith's last with longtime collaborator and pedal steel guitarist Red Rhodes, who died shortly after the concert.
The album features a rare occasion of Nesmith (as a solo artist) singing a Monkees song, Papa Gene's Blues (originally from the album The Monkees).
