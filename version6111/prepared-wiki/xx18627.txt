Historically, the area was important to the fur trade, and the county itself takes its name from one of Wyoming's early fur traders, William L.

==Government==

Sublette County is managed by a county commission with three members.
In 2011, Sublette County residents petitioned voters to approve an increase in this number to five as allowed under Wyoming law.  The ballot initiative passed and five commissioners were to be seated during the 2012 election cycle.
In early 2012, another ballot initiative was presented to voters requesting their approval to decrease the number of county commissioners back to three even before seating the two additional commissioners.  This second special election, held on May 8, 2012, returned the number of commissioners on the council back to the original number of three.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.sublettetimes.com/news/the-3s-have-it-in-sublette-county/ |title=The Three's Have It In Sublette County |accessdate= 2012-05-09 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= May 2012 |format= |work= News Article |publisher= Sublette Times[/tpl]
