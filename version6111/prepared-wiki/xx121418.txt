Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MBD1 gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Cross SH, Meehan RR, Nan X, Bird A | title = A component of the transcriptional repressor MeCP1 shares a motif with DNA methyltransferase and HRX proteins | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 256–9 |date=Jul 1997 | pmid = 9207790 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/ng0797-256 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Hendrich B, Abbott C, McQueen H, Chambers D, Cross S, Bird A | title = Genomic structure and chromosomal mapping of the murine and human Mbd1, Mbd2, Mbd3, and Mbd4 genes | journal = Mamm Genome | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 906–12 |date=Sep 1999 | pmid = 10441743 | pmc =  | doi =10.1007/s003359901112  [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: MBD1 methyl-CpG binding domain protein 1| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=4152| accessdate = [/tpl] The protein encoded by MBD1 binds to methylated sequences in DNA, and thereby influences transcription.  It binds to a variety of methylated sequences, and appears to mediate repression of gene expression.  It has been shown to play a role in chromatin modification through interaction with the histone H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1. H3K9me3is a repressive modification.
