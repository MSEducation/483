==Artificial colouring==

Green colouring is often used to colour mushy peas. It is typically achieved by adding the yellow and blue additives, E102 and E133, which together produce the green effect. The use of artificial colours results in bright green mushy peas. Pure mushy peas, with no colouring, tend to form a more grey-green end product. Sodium bicarbonate is often added to soften the peas to enhance the colour and to inhibit fermentation during soaking, which reduces later flatulence in consuming said foods. The British Food Standards Agency, on 28 April 2008, asked for a voluntary ban on artificial food colourings and suggested that the ban would be practical by the end of 2009. This would mean that certain foods, including mushy peas, would need to be free of the additive, otherwise the item might be removed from sale.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/apr/10/foodanddrink|title=FSA calls for voluntary ban on artificial colourings|first=James|last=Meikle|publisher=The Guardian|date=2008-04-10 | location=London[/tpl] Mushy peas present a particular problem since there is presently no alternative to tartrazine (E102), that gives it the bright green colour.[tpl]Verify source|date=September 2009[/tpl] Without the colourant the dish would be murky grey. Ministers have stated that they will pursue a ban through law if food manufacturers do not phase out the food colourings."UK: Ban on food additives 'supported by ministers'", Fresh Plaza, 17 November 2008
