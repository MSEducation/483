In 1982, Indian Railways (IR) set up a central organization (COFOIS) to computerise freight operations. In 1986 the Ministry of Railways saw the need for a dedicated, autonomous organisation and established CRIS, an umbrella organisation for all information technology-related activities on Indian Railways. It was entrusted with the task of designing, developing and implementing COFOIS and its communications infrastructure. CRIS began functioning in July 1987 as an autonomous organisation headed by a managing director.
A unique feature of CRIS is collaboration by IT specialists and railway experts on assignment from Indian Railways. Systems managed by CRIS have received international recognition from Computerworld.2005 Computerworld Honors Case Study, accessed 8 January 2007PCQUEST (India) Best IT Implementation of the Year 2006, accessed 8 January 2007
CRIS held a symposium, "IT Can Happen in Government", in New Delhi on 1 July 2010. The symposium explored the challenges faced by government agencies in meeting their IT needs and creating IT systems.

Independently-running applications interchange data amongst themselves. COA (Control Office Application), which assists train controllers (despatchers) in planning and tracking the movement of trains across the network, shares its data with applications such as NTES (by which passengers can obtain a train's location and forecast movement). Train punctuality reports are generated through ICMS (Integrated Coaching Management System), which also receives data from COA.
