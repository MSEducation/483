==Production==

The Living Desert was the first feature-length film in Disney’s True-Life Adventures series of documentaries focusing on zoological studies; the previous films in the series, including the Academy Award-winning Seal Island, were short subjects.[tpl]Cite book|url= | title=Walt Disney: An American Original |author=Bob Thomas | publisher=Pocket Books| pages=248–9 | year=1976 | isbn=0-671-66232-5[/tpl]
The documentary was filmed at the Westward Look Wyndham Grand Resort and Spa in Tucson, Arizona. Most of the wildlife shown in the film was donated to what would soon become the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum.
The film was inspired by 10 minutes of footage shot by N. Paul Kenworthy Jr., a doctoral student at the University of California at Los Angeles. Kenworthy’s footage of a battle between a tarantula and a wasp intrigued Disney, who funded a feature-length production following the lives of diverse desert species. Disney was highly supportive of Kenworthy’s work and its impact on nonfiction filmmaking, stating, “This is where we can tell a real, sustained story for the first time in these nature pictures.”

==Release==

Prior to the production of The Living Desert, Disney was releasing his films through RKO Radio Pictures. But due to a long-frayed relation with the studio, which had little enthusiasm for the producer's documentary releases, Disney opted to sever his relation with RKO and create his own distribution subsidiary – Buena Vista Distribution, which he named after the street where his office was located.
The Living Desert received some criticism for bringing unsubtle humor to its scenes of desert life – Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called Disney to task for adding jokey musical effects to several of the film’s scenes, including hoedown music for a sequence involving a scorpion battle.[tpl]cite news | author =Bosley Crowther | title =The Living Desert | publisher =The New York Times| date =November 10, 1953 | url =http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&res=9B0DE5DB1139E23BBC4852DFB7678388649EDE | accessdate=October 13, 2009[/tpl]   Nonetheless, the film was a commercial success: the US$300,000 production grossed US$4,000,000 at the box office.

==Honors==

The Academy Award that Disney earned for The Living Desert helped the producer make history as the individual with the most Oscar wins in a single year.
