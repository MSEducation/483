[[Architecture of Tokyo]]

CATEGORIES: Tokyo, Buildings and structures in Tokyo, Architecture by city

Architecture in Tokyo has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.  Because of this, Tokyo's current urban landscape is one of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[ref]Hidenobu Jinnai. Tokyo: A Spatial Anthropology.
