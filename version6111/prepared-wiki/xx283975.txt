Clyde Bridge, not to be confused with the similarly named Clyde's Bridge further upstream, is a road bridge built in 1831 spanning the River Clyde in Motherwell, Scotland. The bridge carries the A723 from Motherwell to Hamilton and the Hamilton Interchange junction of the M74 motorway. In 2011, South Lanarkshire Council undertook a Â£38,000 renovation of the steel girder bridge to strengthen the underwater supports, following Government advice after several bridges were washed away in flooding.[tpl]cite web|title=Clyde Bridge|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Clyde_Bridge|publisher=Sabre-Roads|accessdate=11/8/13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Clyde Bridge repairs|url=http://www.southlanarkshire.gov.uk/press/article/332/work_ensures_future_of_clyde_bridge|title=Clyde_Bridge_repairs|publisher=South Lanarkshire Council|accessdate=12/8/13[/tpl]
