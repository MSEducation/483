The European Academy for Environmental Affairs (also known as European Academy of Environmental Affairs) is a private organization which cosponsored the 1995 conference that produced the Leipzig Declaration on Global Climate Change, a SEPP-initiated document in which some scientists argue against global warming theories. Founder and president of the Academy was the late Prof. Dr. hc. Helmut Metzner (1925-1999), who was professor for chemical plant physiology. Metzner was accused of having connections to the Studienzentrum Weikersheim, a right-wing think-tank in Baden-Württemberg.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projektwerkstatt.de/oepunkte/althefte/ausgaben/01/54_clinton.html |title=Ö-Punkte - Frühjahr 1998 |publisher=Projektwerkstatt.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-01[/tpl]
In 1993 the Academy also held a conference in Mannheim under the title "Globale Erwärmung - Tatsache oder Behauptung?" (Global warming—fact or fiction?). The Academy was recognized in a consultative function by the Council of Europe, but the status was withdrawn because of the Academy's failure to comply with its obligations.[tpl]cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=251911|title=Granting and withdrawal of consultative status to international non-governmental organisations [/tpl]
The Academy has no active web pages, and it may be defunct. A list of textbooks on ecology issued by the Academy is available online.
