[[Coin collecting]]

CATEGORIES: Collecting, Coins, Exonumia

Coin collecting is the collecting of coins or other forms of minted legal tender.
Coins of interest to collectors often include those that circulated for only a brief time, coins with mint errors and especially beautiful or historically significant pieces. Coin collecting can be differentiated from numismatics in that the latter is the systematic study of currency. Though closely related, the two disciplines are not necessarily the same. A numismatist may or may not be a coin collector, and vice versa.

==History==

People have hoarded coins for their bullion value for as long as coins have been minted.[tpl]cite web|title=The Origins of Coinage:The earliest coin hoard |url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/themes/money/the_origins_of_coinage.aspx|work=The British Museum:Explore/Money, www.britishmuseum.org|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl]  However, the collection of coins for their artistic value was a later development.

Quote: "The Nestorian scholars and artisans who served the princes of the Jazira (Mesopotamia, now Iraq, Syria, and Turkey) in the 12th and 13th centuries designed a magnificent series of coins with motifs based on ancient Greek and Roman issues. Some of these so accurately render the details of the originals that even the inscriptions are faithfully repeated. Others were modified in intriguing ways. ... The great variety and the sophisticated use of these images reveal the existence of well-studied collections." indicates that coins were collected and catalogued by scholars and state treasuries. It also seems probable that individual citizens collected old, exotic or commemorative coins as an affordable, portable form of art.[tpl]cite web |title=Coin Collecting|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124774/coin-collecting|work=Britannica Online, www.britannica.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl] According to  Suetonius in his De vita Caesarum (The Lives of the Twelve Caesars), written in the first century CE, the emperor Augustus sometimes presented old and exotic coins to friends and courtiers during festivals and other special occasions.Tranquillus, C.

Contemporary coin collecting and appreciation began around the fourteenth century. During the Renaissance, it became a fad among some members of the privileged classes, especially kings and queens. The Italian scholar and poet Petrarch is credited with being the pursuit's first and most famous aficionado.  Following his lead, many European kings, princes, and other nobility kept collections of ancient coins. Some notable collectors were Pope Boniface VIII, Emperor Maximilian[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] of the Holy Roman Empire, Louis XIV of France, Ferdinand I, Henry IV of France and Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg, who started the Berlin Coin Cabinet (German: Münzkabinett Berlin). Perhaps because only the very wealthy could afford the pursuit, in Renaissance times coin collecting became known as the "Hobby of Kings."[tpl]cite web |title=The Coin Collection History |url=http://www.coincollectingalbum.com/coin-collecting-history.html |work=www.coincollectingalbum.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Brief History of Coin Collecting |url=http://www.2-clicks-coins.com/article/coin-collecting-history.html |work=www.2-clicks-coins.com|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Coin Collectors: Emperor Maximilian |url=http://www.zoomcoin.com/rare-coin-article/coin-collectors-emperor-maximilian/|work=www.zoomcoin.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl]
During the 17th and 18th centuries coin collecting remained a pursuit of the well-to-do. But rational, Enlightenment thinking led to a more systematic approach to accumulation and study.  Numismatics as an academic discipline emerged in these centuries at the same time as coin collecting became a leisure pursuit of a growing middle class, eager to prove their wealth and sophistication. During the 19th and 20th centuries, coin collecting increased further in popularity.  The market for coins expanded to include not only antique coins, but foreign or otherwise exotic currency. Coin shows, trade associations, and regulatory bodies emerged during these decades. The first international convention for coin collectors was held  15–18 August 1962, in Detroit, Michigan, and was sponsored by the American Numismatic Association and the Royal Canadian Numismatic Association. Attendance was estimated at 40,000. As one of the oldest and most popular world pastimes, coin collecting is now often referred to as the "King of Hobbies".[tpl]cite web |title=Coin Collecting|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A672013|work= BBC:H2G2, www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Brief History of Coin Collecting |url=http://www.2-clicks-coins.com/article/coin-collecting-history.html |work=www.2-clicks-coins.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl]

==Motivations for coin collecting==

“Art in the form of coins is not only what we study but the emotion when we hold a piece of history” - Geoffrey Cope.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
The motivations for collecting are varied.  Possibly the most common type of collector is the hobbyist, who amasses a collection purely for fun with no real expectation of profit. This is especially true of casual collectors and children who collect items on the basis of chance and personal interest.
Another frequent reason for purchasing coins is as an investment. As with stamps, precious metals or other commodities, coin prices are cyclical based on supply and demand. Prices drop for coins that are not in long-term demand, and increase along with a coin's perceived or intrinsic value.  Investors buy with the expectation that the value of their purchase will increase over the long term. As with all types of investment, the principle of caveat emptor applies and study is recommended before buying. Likewise, as with most collectibles, a coin collection does not produce income until it is sold, and may even incur costs (for example, the cost of safe deposit box storage) in the interim.[tpl]cite web |title= Collecting And Investing In Coins|url= http://www.oldandsold.com/articles02/coincollecting15.shtml|work=www.oldandsold.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl]
Coin hoarders may be similar to investors in the sense that they accumulate coins for potential long-term profit. However, unlike investors, they typically do not take into account aesthetic considerations; rather they gather whatever quantity of coins they can and hold them. This is most common with coins whose metal value exceeds their spending value.[tpl]cite web |title= Coin Hoards | url=http://www.australian-threepence.com/blog/2009/07/coin-hoards.html |work=www.australian-threepence.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl]
Speculators, be they amateurs or commercial buyers, generally purchase coins in bulk and often act with the expectation of short-term profit.  They may wish to take advantage of a spike in demand for a particular coin (for example, during the annual release of Canadian numismatic collectibles from the Royal Canadian Mint).  The speculator might hope to buy the coin in large lots and sell at profit within weeks or months. Speculators may also buy common circulation coins for their intrinsic metal value.  Coins without collectible value may be melted down or distributed as bullion for commercial purposes. Typically they purchase coins that are composed of rare or precious metals, or coins that have a high purity of a specific metal.[tpl]cite web |title=What is a Coin Collector? |url=http://www.2-clicks-coins.com/article/what-is-a-coin-collector.html |work=www.2-clicks-coins.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl]
A final type of collector is the inheritor, an accidental collector who acquires coins (a collection, hoard or investment) from another person as part of an inheritance. The inheritor may not necessarily have an interest in or know anything about numismatics at the time of the acquisition.

==Collector types==

Casual coin collectors often begin the hobby by saving notable coins found by chance. These coins may be pocket change left from an international trip or an old coin found in circulation.
Usually, if the enthusiasm of the novice increases over time, random coins found in circulation are not enough to satisfy their interest.  The hobbyist may then trade coins in a coin club or buy coins from dealers or mints. Their collection takes on a more specific focus.
Some enthusiasts become generalists and accumulate a few examples from a broad variety of historical or geographically significant coins. Given enough resources, this can result in a vast collection. King Farouk of Egypt was a generalist with a collection famous for its scope and variety.
Most collectors decide to focus their financial resources on a narrower, specialist interest. Some collectors focus on coins of a certain nation or historic period.  Others will seek error coins. Still others might focus on exonumia such as currency, tokens or challenge coins. For example, John Yarwood of Melbourne is the first person to take a serious interest in British military money (especially tokens).[tpl]cite news|last=Cockington|first=James|title=Tokens of our affection|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|page=Money supplement (p. 13)|date=11 March 2009|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/money/planning/tokens-of-our-affection/2009/03/09/1236447130062.html|accessdate=11 March 2009[/tpl]
Some collectors are completists and seek an example of every type of coin within a certain category. Perhaps the most famous of these is Louis Eliasberg, the only collector thus far to assemble a complete set of known coins of the United States.
Coin collecting can become a competitive activity, as prompted by the recent emergence of PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) and NGC (Numismatic Guarantee Corporation) Registry Sets. Registry Sets are private collections of coins verified for ownership and quality by numismatic grading services. The grading services assess collections, seal the coins in clear plastic holders, then register and publish the results. This can lead to very high prices as dedicated collectors compete for the very best specimens of, for example, each date and mint mark combination.[tpl]cite web |title=PCGS Set Registry |url=http://www.pcgs.com/setregistry/|work=www.pcgs.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=NGC Collectors Society |url=http://coins.www.collectors-society.com/registry/coins/public_sets.aspx|work=www.ngccoin.com  |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl]

A few common themes are often combined into a goal for a collection:
