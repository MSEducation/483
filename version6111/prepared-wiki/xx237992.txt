Bulgaria decided not to use a multi-heat selection system of previous years and select their artist internally. A panel of 51 music experts voted for a number of candidates with Miroslav Kostadinov the winner with 10 votes, followed Poli Genova with 7 and Nora in third place with 3. Other artists in the running were Slavi Trifonov, Maria Ilieva, Lili Ivanova, Elitsa Todorova and Stoyan Yankoulov, the 2007 Bulgarian representatives.
A national final was organized, where Miroslav Kostadinov performed five songs, written especially for him in five different music genres ranging from ethno to rock. The winning song, selected by televote, was Angel si ti. It was performed on the second semifinal on 27 May, and did not qualify to the final.
