Moving up the ranks, Glen made his picture editorial debut on a documentary series titled Chemistry For Six Forms in 1961, and his directorial debut on the TV series Man in a Suitcase in 1968 (directing the episode "Somebody Loses, Somebody ... Wins?").[tpl]cite web|last=Dillon|first=Mark|title=The name’s Glen, John Glen|url=http://www.cceditors.ca/2012/12/04/the-names-glen-john-glen/|publisher=Canadian Cinema Editors|accessdate=9 February 2013|date=4 December 2012[/tpl]
During the 1960s and 1970s, Glen served as a film editor and second unit director, working on such films as Superman (1978) and The Wild Geese (1978); he also contributed to three James Bond films: On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) and Moonraker (1979). Following the release of Moonraker, Glen was promoted to the rank of official director of the series;[tpl]cite video|date=2012|title=Inside For Your Eyes Only|medium=Blu-ray|publisher=MGM|location=Bond 50, For Your Eyes Only Disc[/tpl] he went on to direct all five Bond films of the 1980s, making him the only director to direct more than four films in the series.

After Bond, Glen continued to direct, with credits including Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992) and The Point Men (2001). He also directed episodes of the science-fiction television series Space Precinct (1994–95). In 2001, he published his memoir, For My Eyes Only.

==Directorial style==

Glen's films contain a recurring motif in the form of a startled pigeon that makes the actor (as well as the audience) jump; it is especially noticeable in his five James Bond films. Variations exist; in some cases, the animal is a cat (A View to a Kill) or a monkey (The Living Daylights). As editor of Moonraker, Glen was responsible for creating the "double-taking pigeon", an editing trick that makes it appear as if a bird in St Mark's Square in Venice cannot believe its eyes when Bond's (Roger Moore) gondola transforms into a hovercraft. In addition, all of Glen's Bond feature a character who dies by falling from a height, in a sequence commonly accompanied by the same "male scream" sound effect.
Glen often re-used actors in his films. In his autobiography, he states that he wanted to cast Timothy Dalton in Christopher Columbus: The Discovery but that Dalton left the project before shooting commenced; Glen wonders whether[tpl]Spaced ndash[/tpl]following an argument at the end of shooting on Licence to Kill[tpl]Spaced ndash[/tpl]Dalton did not wish to appear in any more of his films. Several other cast members from the Glen Bond films appear in Christopher Columbus: the Discovery; among them are Robert Davi, Benicio Del Toro, Michael Gothard and Nigel Terry.
