Again Spain looked threatening bringing it back to 2-2 and 10 minutes later, 3-2. The scoreline continued to change and by the end of normal time the score was 4-4. Extra time was uneventful which meant penalties. Amarelle stepped up and hit the post which meant it was all down to Massimiliano Esposito to finish the job.
