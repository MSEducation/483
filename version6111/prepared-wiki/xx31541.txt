CATEGORIES: Locations in Greek mythology, Greek mythology

In Greek mythology, Agelasta (Ἀγέλαστος in Ancient Greek or Αγέλαστη Modern Greek "smile-less") was the name of the stone on which Demeter rested during her search for Persephone.
In modern culture, Agelasta inspired the title of a documentary by Philippos Koutsaftis (Φίλιππος Κουτσαφτής), called Agelastos Petra - Αγέλαστος Πέτρα "smile-less stone" (2000) on Modern Eleusis.
