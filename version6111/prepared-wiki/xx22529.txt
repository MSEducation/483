==History==

===Early settlement===

The first known people of European descent to come to the area were the troops of the Sullivan Expedition in 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, who destroyed local villages of the Onondaga and Oneida tribes. The city was named after William Bingham, a wealthy Philadelphian who bought the 10,000 acre patent for the land in 1786, then consisting of portions of the towns of Union and Chenango.[tpl]cite web|title=Binghamton: Building the Parlor City|url=http://www.wskg.org/episode/binghamton-building-parlor-city|publisher=WSKG|accessdate=31 August 2013[/tpl]  Joshua Whitney, Jr., Bingham's land agent, chose land at the junction of the Chenango and Susquehanna Rivers to develop a settlement, then named Chenango Point, and helped build its roads and erect the first bridge.[tpl]cite book|last=Hinman|first=Marjory|title=Whitney's Town|year=1996|publisher=Broome County Historical Society|location=Binghamton, NY[/tpl]  Significant agricultural growth led to the incorporation of the village of Binghamton in 1834.
The Chenango Canal, completed in 1837, connected Binghamton to the Erie Canal, and was the impetus for the initial industrial development of the area.[tpl]cite book|last=McFee|first=Michele|title=Limestone Locks and Overgrowth: The Rise and Descent of the Chenango Canal|year=1993|publisher=Purple Mountain Press|location=Fleischmanns, NY|isbn=978-0-935-79644-5[/tpl]  This growth accelerated with the completion of the Erie Railroad between Binghamton and New York City in 1849.[tpl]cite web|title=Erie History|url=http://www.erierailroad.org/erie-history/|publisher=Erie Railroad Historical Website|accessdate=31 August 2013[/tpl] With the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad arriving soon after, the village became an important regional transportation center.[tpl]cite web|title=DL&W, Erie, and D&H Early Binghamton History|url=http://www.trainweb.org/SVRHS/earlyRR.html|publisher=Susquehanna Valley Railway Historical Society|accessdate=31 August 2013[/tpl] Several buildings of importance were built at this time, including the New York State Inebriate Asylum, opened in 1858 as the first center in the United States to treat alcoholism as a disease.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1611239784&ResourceType=Building|title=New York State Inebriate Asylum|date=15 September 2007|accessdate=31 August 2013|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service[/tpl]

===Valley of Opportunity: Growth as a manufacturing hub===

Binghamton incorporated as a city in 1867, and due to the presence of several stately homes, was nicknamed the Parlor City.  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many immigrants moved to the area, finding an abundance of jobs.  During the 1880s, Binghamton grew to become the second-largest manufacturer of cigars in the United States.  However, by the early 1920s, the major employer of the region became Endicott Johnson, a shoe manufacturer whose development of welfare capitalism resulted in many amenities for local residents.[tpl]cite book|last=McGuire|first=Randall|editor-first=Julian|editor-last=Thomas|title=Interpretive Archaeology: A Reader|publisher=Continuum|year=2000|pages=228–245|chapter=Chapter 13: Building Power in the Cultural Landscape of Broome County, New York, 1880-1940|isbn=978-1-441-17929-6[/tpl]  An even larger influx of Europeans immigrated to Binghamton, and the working class prosperity resulted in the area being called the Valley of Opportunity.
In 1913, 31 people perished in the Binghamton Clothing Company fire, which resulted in numerous reforms to the New York fire code.[tpl]cite news|title=The fire at Binghamton|work =New York Times|date=24 July 1913|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F30A1FF83E5B13738DDDAD0A94DF405B838DF1D3|accessdate=31 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Simonson|first=Mark|title=Binghamton fire spurred improved safety laws|work=The Daily Star|location=Oneonta, NY|date=July 19, 2008|url=http://thedailystar.com/columns/x112901097/Binghamton-fire-spurred-improved-safety-laws|accessdate=31 August 2013[/tpl]  Major floods in 1935 and 1936 resulted in a number of deaths, and washed out the Ferry Street Bridge (now the Clinton Street Bridge).  The floods were devastating, and resulted in the construction of flood walls along the length of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers.[tpl]cite journal|last=Coates|first=Donald|title=Geomorphology in legal affairs of the Binghamton, New York, metropolitan area|journal=GSA Special Papers|year=1976|volume=174|pages=111–148|doi=10.1130/SPE174-p111[/tpl]
During the Second World War, growth and corporate generosity continued as IBM, which was founded in Greater Binghamton, emerged as a global technology leader.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title=IBM|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of New York State|editor1-last=Eisenstadt|editor1-first=Peter|editor2-last=Moss|editor2-first=Laura-Eve|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, NY|isbn=978-0-815-60808-0|year=2005|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tmHEm5ohoCUC&lpg=PA756&pg=PA756|accessdate=31 August 2013[/tpl]  Along with Edwin Link's invention of the flight simulator in Binghamton, IBM transitioned the region to a high-tech economy.  Other major manufacturers included Ansco and General Electric.  Until the Cold War ended, the area never experienced an economic downfall, due in part to its defense-oriented industries.  The population of the city of Binghamton peaked at around 85,000 in the mid-1950s.[tpl]cite book|title=A Brief History of Binghamton, NY, The Parlor City|year=1984|publisher=Binghamton Public Library|location=Binghamton, NY[/tpl]

===Decline and recovery===

Post-war suburban development led to a decline in the city population, as the towns of Vestal and Union experienced rapid growth.  As seen in many other Rust Belt cities, traditional manufacturers saw steep declines, though Binghamton's technology industry limited this impact.  In an effort to reverse these trends, urban renewal dominated much of the construction during the 1960s and early 1970s, with many ornate city buildings torn down during this period.  The construction included the creation of Government Plaza, the Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena, and North Shore Dr. (NY 363).[tpl]cite news|last=Heavey|first=James|title=$80,000,000 Public-Private Outlay Urged to Rebuild Mid-City Area|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201961/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201961%20-%204061.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=The Evening Press|location=Binghamton, NY|date=22 March 1961[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Five-Stage Plan Is Urged to Cushion Impact|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201963/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201963%20-%200580.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=The Sunday Press|location=Binghamton, NY|date=13 January 1963[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Fitchette|first=Woody|title=City Gets $6,363,571 Project 1 Renewal Aid|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201968/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201968%20a%20-%205447.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=The Binghamton Press|date=13 November 1968|location=Binghamton, NY[/tpl]  As was typical of urban renewal, these projects ultimately failed to stem most of the losses, though they did establish Binghamton as the government and cultural center of the region.
As the Cold War came to a close in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the defense-related industries in Greater Binghamton began to falter, resulting in several closures and widespread layoffs[tpl]cite web|title=History|url=http://www.binghamton-ny.gov/history|work=City of Binghamton, New York|accessdate=31 August 2013[/tpl]  These were most notable at IBM, which sold its Federal Systems division and laid off several thousands of workers.  The local economy went into a deep recession, and the long-prevalent manufacturing jobs dropped by 64% from 1990 to 2013.[tpl]cite news|last=Platsky|first=Jeff|title=Binghamton region gains 100 jobs, but manufacturing at all-time low|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20130307/BUSINESS/303070048/Binghamton-region-gains-100-jobs-manufacturing-all-time-low|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=Press & Sun-Bulletin|location=Binghamton, NY|date=7 March 2013[/tpl]

In the 21st century, the city has attempted to diversify its economic base in order to spur revitalization.  The local economy has slowly transitioned towards a focus on services and healthcare.  Major emphasis has been placed on Binghamton University, which built a downtown campus in 2007,[tpl]cite web|title=Campus Facilities|url=http://www.binghamton.edu/visiting-campus/campus-facilities.html|publisher=Binghamton University[/tpl] and several student housing complexes have been created downtown.[tpl]cite web|title=Binghamton & Regional Economy|url=http://www.binghamton-ny.gov/binghamton-regional-economy|publisher=City of Binghamton, New York|accessdate=31 August 2013[/tpl]  Further student housing projects are planned, and the increased downtown residential population has spurred development of supporting businesses, along with a renewed focus on the riverfront.[tpl]cite news|last=Robinson|first=David|title=A year of revival for downtown Binghamton|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20121227/NEWS01/312270049/0/news01/Binghamton-had-a-significant-year-in-terms-of-turnaround-|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=Press & Sun-Bulletin|date=27 December 2013|location=Binghamton, NY[/tpl]  Unfortunately, the recovery has been stymied by two severe floods.  While the majority of the impact of the Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006 was in the surrounding metropolitan area, the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee topped city flood walls in September 2011, causing $1 billion of damage in Greater Binghamton.[tpl]cite web|last=Masters|first=Jeff|title=Tropical Storm Lee's flood in Binghamton: was global warming the final straw?|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/tropical-storm-lees-flood-in-binghamton-was-global-warming-the-final|work=Dr. Jeff Masters' WunderBlog|publisher=Weather Underground|accessdate=31 August 2013|date=14 December 2011[/tpl]

==Geography==

===Cityscape===

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|11.14|sqmi|km2[/tpl]. [tpl]convert|10.49|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of it is land and [tpl]convert|0.65|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of it (5.83%) is water.[tpl]GR|8[/tpl]
Binghamton is located at the confluence of two rivers, in the middle of a long but relatively narrow valley.  The north branch of the Susquehanna River passes south of downtown. This branch rises in eastern New York and receives a number of tributaries above Binghamton.  In the center of the city, the Chenango River feeds into the Susquehanna from the north. As a result, eleven bridges span the rivers inside city limits.  Major floods have occurred in 1865, 1935, 1936, 2006, and 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Top Ten Highest Historical Crests: Susquehanna River at Binghamton|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/marfc/Rivers/FloodClimo/Top_Flood_Crests/Nbs/Binghamton-NBS-Top10-Table.pdf|work=North Branch Susquehanna River Basins|publisher=National Weather Service, Mid Atlantic River Forecast Center|accessdate=1 September 2013|date=31 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=History of Flooding|url=http://www.srbc.net/flood_forecasting/history_of_flooding.htm|work=Flood Forecast & Warning in the Susquehanna River Basin|publisher=Susquehanna River Basin Commission|accessdate=31 August 2013[/tpl]
The incorporation of Binghamton united various communities located on both shores of the two rivers. The majority of the city's population and development lies along the rolling terrain nearest the riverbanks with sparse development in the hills that define the city limits.  The old city was laid out on a grid system by Joshua Whitney, Jr., but as development spread to the outer regions of the city and merged with other settlements, several grids were eventually juxtaposed against each other.  In the Southside, the grid breaks down, as more curvilinear roads make up the predominantly residential areas along the hills.
The city was the traditional economic center of the region, and contains several historic districts.  The Railroad Terminal Historic District consists of several factories and buildings along the railroad line in the northern limits of downtown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=769|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Railroad Terminal Historic District|date=January 1986|accessdate=31 August 2013|last=Peckham|first=Mark|publisher=New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation[/tpl]  Over 1,000 properties on the West Side contribute to the Abel Bennett Tract Historic District, mainly made up of residential properties along Riverside Drive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=102474|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Abel Bennett Tract Historic District|accessdate=31 August 2013|publisher=New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation[/tpl]  The State Street-Henry Street Historic District in downtown consists of several older low-rise buildings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=784|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: State Street-Henry Street Historic District|date=December 1985|accessdate=31 August 2013|last=Peckham|first=Mark|publisher=New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation[/tpl]  The Court Street Historic District contains some of the most notable architecture in the city, including the Press Building and Security Mutual Building, early 20th century high rises, and the Broome County Courthouse.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=788|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Court Street Historic District|date=July 1984|accessdate=31 August 2013|last=Peckham|first=Mark|publisher=New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation[/tpl]  The Press Building was the tallest building in Binghamton until the completion of the State Office Building in Government Plaza, which remains the tallest in the city.[tpl]cite web|title=Binghamton State Office Building Facts|url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building.php?building_id=12349|accessdate=31 August 2013|year=2013|work=The Skyscraper Center|publisher=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat[/tpl]  Away from downtown, the majority of the buildings are single- and multi-family dwellings, along with low-rise business buildings lining commercial arteries.  Along the railroad corridors, a number of factories, mostly abandoned, rise above the otherwise-uniform landscape.
Main Street runs through the West Side, and continues west to serve as Main Street in the villages of Johnson City and Endicott.  On the east side of the Chenango River, the road becomes Court Street, the major east-west artery in downtown and the East Side.

===Neighborhoods===

Binghamton is divided into seven neighborhoods.[tpl]cite web|title=Binghamton Neighborhood Assemblies|url=http://www.binghamtonneighbors.org/|publisher=Binghamton Neighborhood Assemblies|accessdate=31 August 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090628135117/http://www.binghamtonneighbors.org/|archivedate=28 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Sean|title=Participatory Planning in Binghamton, New York|journal=Progressive Planning Magazine|date=Spring 2009|volume=179|url=http://www.plannersnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2009_179_spring.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Parks and Recreation 2013 Programs: Summer in the Parks|publisher=City of Binghamton|year=2013[/tpl]  Downtown Binghamton, also known as Center City, is home to most of the city's largest buildings, and is home to government services.

The East Side lies east of the Brandywine Highway, along the north bank of the Susquehanna River. The neighborhood is largely residential with commercial corridors along both Robinson and Court streets, and contains pockets of industrial development along its borders.
Across the Chenango River lies the West Side, a primarily residential neighborhood along the banks of the Susquehanna, containing a combination of family homes, student housing, and stately mansions. Main Street forms the West Side's commercial corridor, made up of several large supermarkets, pharmacies, bank branches, pubs, restaurants, auto shops, and a few strip malls.[tpl]cite web|title=The West Side|url=http://westsidebinghamton.org/westside.html|publisher=West Side Neighborhood Association|accessdate=31 August 2013|year=2009[/tpl]  The First Ward is a largely residential neighborhood opposite the railroad tracks from the West Side, but is best known for Antique Row, a series of antique shops that line Clinton Street. Several gold-domed ethnic churches are located in this part of the city, as a result of settlement in the area by a large number of Eastern European immigrants.[tpl]cite web|title=Gold Dome Churches Tour|url=http://www.pastny.org/tours/support/brochures/Gold-Dome-Churches.pdf|publisher=Preservation Association of the Southern Tier|accessdate=1 September 2013[/tpl]   Ely Park is Binghamton's northernmost neighborhood, and contains its municipal golf course.[tpl]cite web|title=Ely Park Golf Course|url=http://www.elyparkgolf.com/|accessdate=1 September 2013[/tpl]  It lies on portions of Prospect Mountain and other hills north of the First Ward.
The Southside lies along the south bank of the Susquehanna River, connected to downtown by several bridges. At the base of the historic South Washington Street Bridge is the Southbridge commercial district.[tpl]cite news|title=Commons area underway in city's southside|url=http://binghamton.ynn.com/content/top_stories/547550/commons-area-underway-in-city-s-southside/|accessdate=1 September 2013|newspaper=YNN Southern Tier|date=21 June 2011[/tpl]  The neighborhood is partitioned into two separate neighborhood assemblies, divided by Pennsylvania Avenue and Southbridge, due to their distinct character.  Southside East contains working-class residences and some public housing projects, while Southside West is primarily made up of larger middle-class residences.

===Climate===

Binghamton has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb), with cold, snowy winters and warm, wet summers.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Kottek|first=Marcus|last2=Greiser|first2=Jürgen|last3=Beck|first3=Christoph|last4=Rudolf|first4=Bruno|last5=Rubel|first5=Franz|display-authors=2|title=World Map of Köppen−Geiger Climate Classification|date=June 2006|journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift|volume=15|issue=3|page=261|doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130[/tpl] Summers in Binghamton are typified by warm yet temperate days, and there are an average of only 2.6 days annually where the high exceeds [tpl]convert|90|°F|0[/tpl], with the highest recorded temperature at [tpl]convert|98|°F|0[/tpl] on July 16, 1988.

Snowfall is significant, with an annual total of [tpl]convert|84.4|in|cm|0[/tpl]. Binghamton is not as greatly affected by lake-effect snow as cities further north or west such as Syracuse and Buffalo, which are part of the Great Lakes snowbelt.[tpl]cite web|title=Comparison Golden Snowball City Stats 1940 - 2007|url=http://www.goldensnowball.com/yearly-winners-golden-award.htm|publisher=Golden Snowball Award|accessdate=11 September 2013[/tpl] However, persistent snow bands from both the Great Lakes and the Finger Lakes do occasionally result in moderate snows. Binghamton receives occasional major snowfall from nor'easter storms as well (such as the 1993 Storm of the Century), and competes for the Golden Snowball Award with other upstate cities.

==Demographics==

As of the census[tpl]GR|8[/tpl] of 2010, there were 47,376 people, 21,150 households, and 9,986 families residing in the city.  The population density was 4,516.8 per square mile (1,743.9/km²).  There were 23,842 housing units at an average density of 2,273.1 per square mile (877.6/km²).  Of all households, 20.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 26.9% were married couples living together, 15.6% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.7% had a male householder with no wife present, and 52.8% were non-families. 40.5% of all households were made up of individuals and 25.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.18 and the average family size was 2.94.
Binghamton is home to a large ethnic population.  During its industrial heyday, thousands of European immigrants moved to the city as they found an abundance of jobs and working-class prosperity.  A large number of Italians, Irish, and Eastern Europeans settled in the area, and the American Civic Association was created to help their transition to life and assimilation in the United States. This inrush led to a temporary rise in the local Ku Klux Klan during the 1920s, with Binghamton serving as state headquarters.  Area residents, who primarily embraced the different cultural heritages, quelled such anti-immigrant sentiment by founding several ethnic organizations and holding ethnic celebrations, at the encouragement of Endicott-Johnson.[tpl]cite news|title=Ku Klux Klan Reference Deleted from Pamphlet|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/12/nyregion/ku-klux-klan-reference-deleted-from-pamphlet.html|accessdate=11 September 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=12 September 1993[/tpl] This has had a lasting effect on the city, which sports a large number of churches and contemporary ethnic festivals, along with a population that is still predominantly white (though steadily decreasing in proportion).  As of 2010, the racial makeup of Binghamton was 77.6% White, 11.4% Black or African American, 0.3% Native American, 4.2% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 2.0% from other races, and 4.4% from two or more races.  6.4% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.
Due to its ethnic diversity, there are a large number of religious affiliations within the region.  The First Ward was historically home to much of the Eastern European population, and houses several gold dome Orthodox churches.  As a result of its strong Italian and Irish heritage, the largest religious body in Broome County is the Catholic Church.[tpl]cite web|title=Broome County|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/c/36/rcms2010_36007_county_name_2010.asp|work=County Membership Report|publisher=Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=11 September 2013[/tpl] Binghamton falls under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse.  Throughout the county, 105,064 people, or 52.4% of the total population, are listed as congregational adherents.
Until the mid-1950s, Binghamton saw its population grow rapidly due to its industrial boom, and was one of the largest 100 cities in the United States between 1890 and 1910.[tpl]cite web|last=Gibson|first=Campbell|title=Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/twps0027.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=11 September 2013|date=June 1998[/tpl]  Since then, the city has experienced sustained population loss, some of which was the result of suburbanization.[tpl]GR|9[/tpl]  Much of the recent population loss has occurred throughout the region, and is skewed towards the younger population, resulting in the growth of the relative proportion of the elderly in Broome County.[tpl]cite web|title=A Profile - The Older Population|url=http://www.gobroomecounty.com/senior/populationbrochure|publisher=Broome County Office for Aging|accessdate=11 September 2013[/tpl] In the city, the population was spread out with 19.9% under the age of 18, 15.0% from 18 to 24, 24.7% from 25 to 44, 25.0% from 45 to 64, and 15.3% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 33.2 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.1 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males.
The Binghamton metropolitan area is home to 251,725 people. The MSA is composed of all of Broome County and neighboring Tioga County.  The urban area, which includes portions of Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, has a population of 158,054.[tpl]GR|1[/tpl]  Alternatively defined, the number of people living in an approximately 30-mile radius of the city center is 316,270.[tpl]cite web|title=ZIP Codes in a Radius Lookup|url=http://www.melissadata.com/Lookups/zipradius.asp?afid=sbug&zipcode=13902&radius=30&submit=Search|publisher=Melissa Data|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl]  This count includes Broome County and portions of Tioga, Cortland, Delaware, Chenango, and Tompkins Counties in New York, and parts of Susquehanna, Bradford, and Wayne Counties in Pennsylvania.

==Economy==

After the boom of the cigar industry in the 1880s, the Binghamton area became increasingly reliant on large manufactures, with both Endicott Johnson, a shoe manufacturer, and IBM employing 15,000 to 20,000 local workers at their peak.  Other companies with a significant historical presence included Link Aviation Devices, Ansco, and General Electric.  Several other notable businesses started in Binghamton, such as Valvoline,[tpl]cite web|title=Company Overview|url=http://www.valvoline.com/faqs/our-business/company-overview/|publisher=Valvoline|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl]  the Nineteen Hundred Washer Company (which merged to form Whirlpool),[tpl]cite web|title=100 Years at a Glance|url=http://www.whirlpoolcorp.com/100/includes/documents/factsheet.pdf|publisher=Whirlpool Corporation|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl] and Dr. Kilmer's Swamp Root, a famous patent medicine.[tpl]cite web|title=Dr. Kilmer's Remedies|url=http://www.antiquemedicines.com/Kilmer/Kilmer.htm|publisher=Antique Medicines|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl] Dick's Sporting Goods started out as a fishing store in the East Side in 1948, and remained headquartered in Binghamton until 1994.[tpl]cite news|first=Teresa|last=Lindeman|title=Ed's way stacks up well for Dick's|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2004-11-21[/tpl]
Much of Binghamton's current employment base is still oriented towards technology and defense manufacturing, though the sector has been diminishing since 1990.  Areas of specialization include systems integration, flight simulation, and printed circuit board manufacturing. The largest such companies in the area are Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, IBM, Sanmina-SCI, and Universal Instruments.[tpl]cite web|title=Economic Profile|url=http://www.gobroomecounty.com/files/planning/_pdf/Comprehensive%20Plan/compplan_economicprofile%282%29.pdf|work=Broome County Comprehensive Plan|publisher=Broome County|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl]   Other notable technology firms include Endicott Interconnect, Rockwell Collins, Emerson Network Power, and L-3 Communications, which absorbed the Link Aviation operations.

Education and health care are also becoming significant sectors in the regional economy. In particular, Binghamton University and Broome Community College employ a large number of researchers and educators.  Binghamton University contains a New York State Center of Excellence for small-scale systems integration, and has also provided the major impetus behind the $22 million Southern Tier High Technology Incubator, which is being built in downtown Binghamton to encourage local growth of startups.[tpl]cite news|last=Reilly|first=Steve|title=Southern Tier High Technology Incubator: Region's great hope|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20130202/NEWS01/302020053/0/news01/Southern-Tier-High-Technology-Incubator-Region-s-great-hope|accessdate=2 September 2013|newspaper=Press & Sun-Bulletin|date=2 February 2013|location=Binghamton, NY[/tpl] Upstate Medical University has been working on expanding the presence of its clinical campus by establishing a permanent home at the former New York State Inebriate Asylum on the East Side.[tpl]cite web|last=Geddes|first=Darryl|title=Plans to transform Binghamton landmark into medical school campus moves forward|url=http://www.upstate.edu/news/article.php?title=4780|publisher=Upstate Medical University|accessdate=2 September 2013|date=1 October 2012[/tpl]  Major companies in the private healthcare industry include United Health Services and Lourdes Hospital.

Previously, downtown was also home to several major department stores, and was the center of regional shopping.  Most shopping, however, has now shifted away from the traditional downtown area towards the suburbs.  The town of Vestal has several shopping centers and big-box stores along a five-mile stretch of the Vestal Parkway.[tpl]cite web|title=Shopping|url=http://www.visitbinghamton.org/things-to-do/shopping/|publisher=Greater Binghamton Convention & Visitors Bureau|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl]  The village of Johnson City is home to the Oakdale Mall, the only indoor super regional mall in the area.[tpl]cite web|title=Oakdale Mall, NY|url=http://retail.vno.com/property_home.aspx?id=Oakdale|publisher=Vornado Realty Trust|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl]  Significant commercial development has also taken place in the town of Dickinson, with numerous shopping centers just north of the city.  In the First Ward, Clinton Street is home to Antique Row, a collection of antique shops.

==Sports==

===Baseball===

The area is home to the Eastern League's Binghamton Mets (AA affiliate of the New York Mets). The B-Mets have sent stars like José Reyes, David Wright, Preston Wilson, Ike Davis, Zack Wheeler, Edgardo Alfonzo, Jon Niese, and Jay Payton to the majors.
Binghamton has a long history in professional Organized Baseball dating back to 1877. Teams nicknamed the Crickets, the Bingoes, and for many years the Triplets represented Binghamton in the New York State League (now defunct), the New York-Pennsylvania League, the International League and the Eastern League (1892–94, 1938–1963, 1967–1968, 1992–present).
The 1887 Binghamton Bingoes of the International League attracted national attention for employing 2 black players, an outstanding infielder named Frank Grant and a pitcher whose name has only come down through history as "Renfroe". The reaction around the league forced Binghamton to release the players, and the team itself folded shortly thereafter.
The Binghamton Triplets of the Eastern League became a farm club of the New York Yankees in the 1940s and sent many players to New York up to 1968, most notably the Hall of Fame pitcher Whitey Ford, who starred for Binghamton in 1949.
The best player in the history of Binghamton was the pitcher William "Wild Bill" Hallahan. Born in Binghamton in 1902, he debuted in the major leagues with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1925 and had a 12 year career. (He was known as "Wild Bill" because of the many batters he walked, leading the league in that category twice). Hallahan led the Cardinals to the World Series title in 1931 over the Detroit Tigers with two complete game victories in which he only allowed a total of one run. When his career was over, he worked as a supervisor at Ansco for many years and passed away in Binghamton in 1981.

===Football===

Binghamton is also home to two semi-pro football teams, the Broome County Dragons (members of the Empire Football League) and the Southern Tier Green Machine (members of the North American Football League).

Beginning in 2007, the area hosted a PGA Champion's Tour event, the Dick's Sporting Goods Open. The event replaced the B.C. Open and continues to be played at En-Joie Golf Course in Endicott.

===Hockey===

Professional hockey arrived in Binghamton in 1973 with the founding of the Broome Dusters of the North American Hockey League. The Dusters were popular from the start with a wide open style of play which was unusual in professional hockey at the time. When the league folded in 1977, the Providence team of the American Hockey League moved to Binghamton and became the Binghamton Dusters. The team became the Binghamton Whalers from 1980 to 1990 and the Binghamton Rangers from 1990 to 1997 as a result of affiliations with the NHL Hartford Whalers and New York Rangers. The team is now the Binghamton Senators who currently serve as the AHL affiliate of the Ottawa Senators. The B-Sens won division titles on 2003 and 2005, reaching the AHL conference finals in 2003 and winning the Calder Cup in 2011. They play their home games at Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena.  The B-Sens have sent stars like Jason Spezza, Robin Lehner, Chris Kelly, Jakob Silfverberg and Jean-Gabriel Pageau to the NHL.

===Tennis===

The area is also home to an annual Professional Tennis Challenger, the Levene Gouldin & Thompson Tennis Challenger, part of the USTA pro circuit (Known as the Frito-Lay Tennis Challenger in years past).

===Transportation===

Binghamton is a major junction in the Interstate Highway System, much as it was during the days of the railroad.  Interstate 81, a major north-south route, connects the city to Syracuse and Ontario, as well as to Pennsylvania and Appalachia.  Binghamton also serves as the western terminus of Interstate 88, which gives a direct route to Albany.  New York State Route 17, the Southern Tier Expressway, is in the process of being upgraded to Interstate 86, and spans the southern border of New York, providing access to New York City, as well as to the western Southern Tier and Erie, Pennsylvania.  Between 1953 and 1966, the state constructed an arterial system to alleviate traffic, which includes the Brandywine Highway (New York State Route 7), North Shore Drive (New York State Route 363), and the portion of the Vestal Parkway (New York State Route 434) within city limits.[tpl]cite book|title=Report on State Arterial Highway in the Binghamton Urban Area|year=1947|author=New York State Department of Public Works[/tpl] Other major thoroughfares in the city include Chenango Street, Main Street (New York State Route 17C), and Court/Front Streets (U.S. Route 11).
