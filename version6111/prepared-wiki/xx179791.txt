The Monroe and Toledo Railway is a defunct railroad which operated in southeast Michigan during the mid-1890s. The company was chartered on March 29, 1893, with the proposed object of constructing a line from the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad's Monroe terminal to the Ohio border, just north of Toledo.Michigan Railroad Commission (1893), xxxi. On November 15, 1896, the M&T completed a line from Monroe to Alexis, north of Toledo.Michigan Railroad Commission (1899), 242. In 1897 the F&PM purchased the M&T outright.
