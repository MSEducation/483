Kaulinia is a genus of Polypodiaceae, a family of ferns. It has been named after Professor Kailas Nath Kaul, an Indian botanist and agricultural scientist. In a morphological study of the sporophytes and gametophytes of several species of Microsorum, it became apparent that at least two phyletically distinct groups of species existed in the genus. The group represented by Microsorum pteropus and Microsorum hancockii seemed to have a different ancestry from the other group, now a genus known as Kaulinia.
