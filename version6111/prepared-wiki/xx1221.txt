</ref> Popular tradition also holds that three kings or wise men (named Melchior, [[Casper (name)|Caspar]], and [[Balthazar (given name)|Balthazar]]) visited the infant Jesus in the manger, though this does not strictly follow the biblical account. The Gospel of Matthew instead describes a visit by an unspecified number of [[Biblical magi|magi]], or astrologers, sometime after Jesus was born while the family was living in a house ([tpl]Bibleverse||Matthew|2:11|KJV[/tpl]), who brought gifts of [[gold]], [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]] to the young child Jesus. The visitors were said to be following a mysterious star, commonly known as the [[Star of Bethlehem]], believing it to announce the birth of a king of the Jews.<ref>[tpl]Bibleverse||Matthew|2:2|131[/tpl].</ref> The commemoration of this visit, the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of Epiphany]] celebrated on January 6, is the formal end of the Christmas season in some churches.
Christians celebrate Christmas in various ways. In addition to this day being one of the most important and popular for the attendance of church services, there are other devotions and popular traditions. In some Christian denominations, children re-enact the events of the Nativity with animals to portray the event with more realism or sing carols that reference the event. A long artistic tradition has grown of producing painted depictions of the nativity in art. Nativity scenes are traditionally set in a stable with livestock and include Mary, Joseph, the infant Jesus in the manger, the three wise men, the shepherds and their sheep, the angels, and the Star of Bethlehem.[ref]
