[[List of Canadian federal electoral districts by region]]

CATEGORIES: Canadian electoral districts

This is a list of Canada's 308 electoral districts as defined by the 2003 Representation Order which came into effect on May 23, 2004.  
In most cases, provinces have been broken down into regions of a dozen or fewer districts; these are entirely unofficial and somewhat arbitrary.
