[[Nicotiana alata]]

CATEGORIES: Tobacco, Nicotiana, Garden plants

Nicotiana alata is a species of tobacco. It is called Winged Tobacco, Jasmine Tobacco, tanbaku, and sometimes Persian Tobacco, though the latter name is also used for Nicotiana persica.
Unlike the latter species, which is of some commercial importance in the production of Iranian Tobacco Company cigarettes, N. alata is mainly grown as an ornamental plant; numerous cultivars and hybrids are derived from it. In Iran, narghila tobacco is sometimes produced from N. alata; it is not chopped like cigarette tobacco, but broken up by hand.
Has a lovely fragrance in the evening to night. Most varieties bloom late-afternoon to evening. Seedlings do best when gradually introduced to outdoor environment over the course of a week. Plants tend to self-sow. (Color may be the original or occasionally several colors on one plant).
Deadhead spent flower stalks for best blooming results.
