==History==

The Brunts Academy can trace its history back to an elementary school that was founded in 1687 and had endowments equal to 100 pounds per year. In 1709, Samuel Brunts left a bequest in order that local children could learn an honest trade. The bequest and the school  resulted in 40 boys and girls learning reading, writing and arithmetic by 1831 with the girls particularly studying needlework. It was not until 60 years later that the school and the bequest were combined. By 1891, Samuel Brunts' bequest was worth £3,800 so the new school was named Brunts Technical School.Nottinghamshire in the Eighteenth Century, Jonathan David Chambers, p308, 1966, ISBN 0-7146-1285-5, accessed 18 August 2008
In 1830 Brunts Charity owned buildings and land in East Bridgford, Nottingham's marketplace and at Claypool in Lincolnshire. It was the richest of all the charitable foundations in Mansfield in 1832 when it was paying out £4 a year to 220 different claimants.History, gazetteer, and directory of Nottinghamshire: and the town and county of the town of Nottingham, William White, 1832
