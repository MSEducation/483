The Faber Book of Twentieth Century Verse: An Anthology of Verse in Britain 1900-1950 was a poetry anthology edited by John Heath-Stubbs and David Wright, and first published in 1953 by Faber and Faber. A selection in self-conscious contrast to the Faber Book of Modern Verse, it did not attempt to cover American poetry (beyond Eliot and Pound). It has been through numerous further editions.  It was last issued as a hardback in St. Clair Shores, Michigan by Somerset Publishers Inc. in 1988 with ISBN 0-403-07212-3.
