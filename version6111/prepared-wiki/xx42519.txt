The Partridge Family Album is The Partridge Family's first album.  It was released in 1970 and included their first recording, "I Think I Love You".  It has a picture of the whole family on the back and a small picture of David Cassidy and Shirley Jones.  The album cover is made to look like an old-fashioned photo album.  The original release of the album included a framed color photograph of the group. The exterior label promoting the inclusion of the hit song was affixed to the jacket itself, not the shrink wrap.
The album reached #4 in the U.S. on the Billboard album chart and #6 in neighbouring Canada on the RPM 100 national album chart.Library and Archives Canada. http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.3728&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=8flu94hkg8nkt74latvtu6ttc6 It was produced by Wes Farrell and engineered by Bob Kovach. It was arranged by Mike Melvoin, Billy Strange, Wes Farrell, and Don Peake. A few of the songs on the album feature a choral pop sound by people who were the original voices of The Partridge Family before it was discovered that David Cassidy could sing. They were John and Tom Bahler, Ron Hicklin and Jackie Ward. Shortly after production on the first album and TV show began David Cassidy was promoted by Wes Farrell to lead singer. From that point on they provided the backup vocals for all of the Partridge Family albums, along with Shirley Jones and assorted other singers. The songs on the album were written by such people as Tony Romeo, Terry Cashman, Tommy West, Barry Mann, and Cynthia Weil.
