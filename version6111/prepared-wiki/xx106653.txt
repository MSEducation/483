==Early life==

Hiro Mashima stated that he knew he wanted to be a manga artist for as long as he can recall. His father was an artist that aspired to turn professional, but died when Mashima was young.[tpl]Cite web |last=Hodgkins |first=Crystalyn |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/12434-everyday-hiro-fairy-tail-s-mashima-at-comic-con.html |title=Everyday Hiro: Fairy Tail’s Mashima at Comic-Con |work=Publishers Weekly |date=2008-08-05 |accessdate=2014-03-30[/tpl] Living in the mountains as a child, his grandfather would bring him discarded manga that he found. After reading them, Mashima would draw from them. When he graduated high school, he entered a school specializing in teaching manga artists, but left without completing the studies. He stated that while it taught him the basics, he felt it would not help as a professional.[tpl]Cite web |last=Santos |first=Carlo |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2008-08-17/hiro-mashima |title=Interview: Hiro Mashima |work=Anime News Network |date=2008-08-17 |accessdate=2014-03-30[/tpl]

==Career==

Mashima created a story on his own and brought it to manga editors, which led to entering it into a competition that he won. He made his official serialization debut the following year with Rave in Weekly Shōnen Magazine. It ran until 2005 and was adapted into an anime titled Groove Adventure Rave from 2001 to 2002. Both the manga and anime were released in North America under the name Rave Master.
In 2003, he collected some of his one-shot titles in two volumes: Mashima-en Vol.1 & 2. Those stories include, among others, "Magician", "Xmas Hearts" and the "Fairy Tail" pilot chapter.
From 2005 to 2007, Mashima wrote Monster Soul in Comic BomBom.
While working on Rave, Mashima drew the prototype for what would become Fairy Tail. Fairy Tail began serialization in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine in 2006 and has been adapted into a television anime series.

==Style and influences==

Mashima listed Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball as his favorite manga growing up, and the video game series Dragon Quest as inspiring him to become an artist. He also read/watched several works by Hayao Miyazaki as a child.[tpl]Cite web |last=Hodgkins |first=Crystalyn |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2011-11-08/interview-hiro-mashima |title=Interview: Hiro Mashima |work=Anime News Network |date=2011-11-08 |accessdate=2012-01-03[/tpl] In 2008, when asked if there were any current titles that inspired him, he gave Code Geass as a response. In 2011, Berserk was stated to be his favorite manga.[tpl]Cite web |last=Hodgkins |first=Crystalyn |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2011/new-york-comic-con/9 |title=Kodansha Comics Panel with Hiro Mashima |work=Anime News Network |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2014-03-30[/tpl]
For Rave, Mashima's inspiration was wanting to travel the world, while for Fairy Tail it was simply sitting in bars and partying with his friends, the community aspect, but is also about young people finding their calling. He stated that while he tries to consider both his own interests and the fans' on what will happen next in Fairy Tail, the fans take precedence. 
Mashima has named his main characters after the seasons: In Rave, the main character is named Haru which is Japanese for spring. In Fairy Tail, the main character is [tpl]nihongo3|Natsu|夏[/tpl] which is the Japanese word for summer.Fairy Tail Volume 2, Afterword In Monster Soul, his main character is Aki (Autumn), and in Monster Hunter Orage, he names a character Shiki, which is the Japanese word for seasons. He has also named a character Fuyu, which is Japanese for winter. Mashima said in an About.com interview that he did this because Japanese readers may not be familiar with western fantasy names. The main characters of both Rave and Fairy Tail do not have fathers, partly taken from Mashima's own experience of his father dying when he was young.
Mashima had six assistants in 2008 that worked in an 8,000 sq. feet area with seven desks, as well as a sofa and TV for video games. He revealed his schedule for Fairy Tail was script and storyboards on Monday, rough sketches the following day, and drawing and inking Wednesday through Friday. The weekend was for Monster Hunter; working on a quarter of the story each weekend and finishing by the end of the month. In 2011, he stated that he worked six days a week, for 17 hours a day. Mashima's assistants have included Miki Yoshikawa, who has gone on to work on the romantic comedies Yankee-kun and Megane-chan and Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo. In 2008, together they developed a crossover one-shot story called Fairy Megane where characters from Yankee-kun join the members of Fairy Tail on an assignment.[tpl]cn|date=October 2013|reason=need source on how many crossovers were made and who made them?[/tpl] Shin Mikuni has also assisted for Mashima; Mikuni developed a manga series called Spray King.
