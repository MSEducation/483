[[Pruno]]

CATEGORIES: Fermented beverages, Prison-related crime

Pruno, or prison wine, is an alcoholic beverage variously made from apples, oranges, fruit cocktail, candy, ketchup, sugar, milk, and possibly other ingredients, including crumbled bread. Bread supposedly provides the yeast for the pruno to ferment. Pruno originated in (and remains largely confined to) prisons and jails, where it can be produced with the limited selection of equipment and ingredients available to inmates. The concoction can be made using only a plastic bag, hot running water, and a towel or sock to conceal the pulp during fermentation. The end result has been colorfully described as a "vomit-flavored wine-cooler",[tpl]cite web|last=Gillin |first=Eric |url=http://www.blacktable.com/gillin030901.htm |title=Make Your Own Pruno And May God Have Mercy On Your Soul |publisher=Blacktable.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-08[/tpl] although flavor is often not the primary objective. Depending on the time spent fermenting (always balanced vs the risk of discovery by the guards), the sugar content, and the quality of the ingredients and preparation, pruno's alcohol content by volume can range from as low as 2% (equivalent to a very weak beer) to as high as 14% (equivalent to a strong wine).

==Description==

Typically, the fermenting mass of fruit — called the motor or kicker in prison parlance— is retained from batch to batch to make the fermentation start faster. The more sugar that is added, the greater the potential for a higher alcohol content — to a point.  Beyond this point, the waste products of fermentation (mainly alcohol) cause the motor to die or go dormant as the yeasts' environment becomes too poisoned for them to continue fermenting. This also causes the taste of the end product to suffer. Ascorbic acid or Vitamin C powder is sometimes used to stop the fermentation at a certain point, which, combined with the tartness of the added acid, somewhat enhances the taste by reducing the cloyingly sweet flavor associated with pruno.
Making pruno from potatoes creates the risk for botulism and should thus be avoided. In 2012 botulism outbreaks caused by potato-based pruno were reported among inmates at prisons in Arizona and Utah.[tpl]cite web|last=Hensley|first=Scott|title=Botulism From 'Pruno' Hits Arizona Prison (7 February 2013)|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/02/07/171385104/botulism-from-pruno-hits-arizona-prison|publisher=NPR|accessdate=15 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Hensley|first=Scott|title=Botulism Outbreak Tied To Contaminated Prison Hooch (5 October 2012)|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/10/04/162291607/botulism-outbreak-tied-to-contaminated-prison-hooch|publisher=NPR|accessdate=15 February 2013[/tpl] And in 2004 and 2005 botulism outbreaks were reported among inmates in two California prisons; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suspects in both cases that potatoes used in making pruno were to blame.[tpl]cite web|last=Vugia DJ, Mase SR, Cole B, Stiles J, Rosenberg J, Velasquez L, et al. |title=Botulism from Drinking Pruno (January 2009)|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/15/1/08-1024_article.htm|publisher=Emerg Infect Dis (serial on the Internet)|accessdate=16 February 2013[/tpl]
Inmates are not permitted to have alcoholic beverages, and prison authorities confiscate pruno whenever they find it. In an effort to eradicate pruno, some wardens have gone as far as banning all fresh fruit from prison cafeterias.[tpl]cite news|last=LeDuff|first=Charlie|title=No Vintage California Pruno for New Year's? What's a Jailhouse Oenophile to Do?

Food hoarding in the inmate cells in both prisons and jails allows the inmates to acquire ingredients and produce pruno. Some jails and prisons toss the inmate cells to remove excessive food items and hopefully halt the production of pruno. Pruno is hidden under bunks, inside toilets, inside walls, trash cans, in the shower area and anywhere inmates feel is safe to brew their pruno away from the prying eyes of prison guards and jailers.[tpl]cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=William Richard|title=Prison Work: A Tale of Thirty Years in the California Department of Corrections|year=2005|publisher=Ohio State University Press|isbn=0814210015|pages=78–79|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Bfw2SUfiWmMC&pg=PA78&dq=pruno&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bPseUYjXHpHM9AT58ID4BQ&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=pruno&f=false[/tpl]
Jarvis Masters, a death-row inmate at San Quentin, offers an oft-referenced recipe for pruno in his poem "Recipe for Prison Pruno,"[tpl]cite web|last=Masters|first=Jarvis Jay|title=Recipe for Prison Pruno|url=http://www.pen.org/poetry/recipe-prison-pruno|publisher=PEN America|accessdate=15 February 2013[/tpl] which won a PEN Award in 1992.
Another recipe for pruno can be found in Michael Finkel's Esquire article on Oregon death-row inmate Christian Longo.[tpl]cite web|last=Finkel|first=Michael|title=How I Convinced a Death-Row Murderer Not to Die.|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/christian-longo-0110-3|publisher=Esquire (21 December 2009)|accessdate=15 February 2013[/tpl]
In 2004 at the American Homebrewers Association's National Homebrew Conference in Las Vegas, a pruno competition and judging was held.[tpl]cite web|last=Hardesty|first=Greg|title='Pruno' brew is the toast of the O.C. jail|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/pruno-303659-lynch-county.html|publisher=The Orange County Register (8 June 2011)|accessdate=15 February 2013[/tpl]
A variety of other prison-made alcoholic potables are known to exist. These include crude wines, famously fermented in toilet tanks. Sugary beverages like orange drink may also be fermented and distilled using a radiator or other available heat source. Though popularized in prison fiction, these techniques are slow and laborious, and generally result in a low alcohol content.
