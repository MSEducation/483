Stuart Gray (born 18 December 1973, Harrogate, England) is an English-born Scottish footballer and actor.
Gray represented Celtic and Reading as a fullback and won seven Scotland U21 international caps.  He comes from a footballing family as his father Eddie, uncle Frank and cousin Andy have all represented Scotland.
Stuart Gray is the son of former Scottish International Eddie Gray. Stuart was signed to the club as a schoolboy S-Former in 1989 and followed the route of many on to the groundstaff at 16 in 1990. He played Youth and Reserve team football and was released to play for Giffnock Park North AFC. He ended the 91/92 season close to a first team call up and won a new two year contract.  The next season marked his debut with one appearance against Aberdeen 92/93 but a groin strain in October really put pay to his time in 92/93. In the 93/94 season he lost his edge playing with the Premier Reserves and asked for a loan move south of the border. He spent some time on loan with Bournemouth in February before returning to more Reserve team action. At the end of the season he went to Canada on the post-season tournament with the senior team.
Out of contract at the start of the 94/95 season, he was wanted by Sunderland and Blackburn Rovers and signing month-to-month deals. He eventually signed a new deal on 27 January 1995 with the stated intention of leaving if he did not get more first team football. He had a reasonable run of games and was on the verge of the full-time first team inclusion.
In the 95/96 season he won starting appearances in the latter part of the season but an ankle ligament injury proved troubling and curtailed full involvement. The 96/97 Season was troubled by a knee injury and he ended playing most of the season with the Reserves. Out of contract again his future looked uncertain. A deal to take him to Lille fell through in the closed season and he began the 97/98 season on month-to-month deals. In October he was loaned to Morton till January '98, being recalled from Greenock to play against them in the Scottish Cup tie on 24 January. He played a few more Reserve games before being sold to Tommy Burns at Reading on 26 March 1998. 
He was loaned to Rushden & Diamonds and joined them full-time in January 2001 and released at the end of the 04/05 season. He joined Oxford Utd making 10 appearances with them. He has since been associated with non-League Guiseley AFC and he currently coaches the reserve team there along with Vince Brockie.
He has three sons, Sam, Adam and Sean with his wife Angela.
In the 2009 film The Damned United, Gray portrays his father Eddie.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/tv-showbiz-news/entertainment-news/2009/03/15/pundit-gordon-mcqueen-comes-face-to-face-with-old-self-in-football-film-78057-21199055/ |title=Pundit Gordon McQueen comes face to face with old self in football film - The Daily Record |publisher=Sundaymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24[/tpl]
