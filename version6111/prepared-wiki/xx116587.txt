[[AP Russian Language and Culture]]

In collaboration with the College Board and with funding from the U.S. Department of Education and the National Security Education Program, an AP Russian Language and Culture course and exam is under development through the American Council of Teachers of Russian (ACTR). The timeline for this course is currently under review. It is graded on a 180 point scale, where the score can range from one to five.
AP Russian Language is equivalent to a second-year college-level Russian language course. Students enrolling in AP Russian Language and Culture are typically in their fourth or fifth year of language study, or have had equivalent experience with the language.
