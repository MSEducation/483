==Geomorphology==

The Great Sandy Desert contains large ergs, often consisting of longitudinal dunes. The Wolfe Creek meteorite impact crater is located in the northeast.

==Population==

The region is sparsely populated. The main populations consist of Indigenous Australian communities and mining centers. The aboriginal people of the desert fall into two main groups: the Martu in the west and the Pintupi in the east. Linguistically, they are speakers of multiple Western Desert Languages. Many of these indigenous people were forcibly removed from their lands during the 20th century and relocated to settlements such as Papunya in the Northern Territory. In recent years,[tpl]When|date=March 2010[/tpl] some of the original inhabitants have returned.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl]

==Climate==

Rainfall is low throughout the coast and far north and is strongly seasonal. Areas near the Kimberley have an average rainfall that exceeds [tpl]convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], but is patchy. Many drought years end with a monsoon cloud mass or tropical cyclone. Like many of Australia's deserts, rainfall is high by desert standards, with the driest parts recording falls little below [tpl]convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl]. A massive evaporation rate makes up for the higher than normal desert rainfall. This region is one which gives rise to the heat lows which help drive the NW monsoon. Almost all rain comes from monsoon thunderstorms, or the occasional tropical cyclone rain depression.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
On average for most of the area, there are about 20â€“30 days where thunderstorms form. However, in the north bordering the Kimberley, 30-40 per year is the average.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
Summer daytime temperatures are some of the hottest in Australia.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] The range on the northern border near the Kimberley at Halls Creek is around [tpl]convert|37|to|38|C|F[/tpl], but this would be indicative of the low end of the range.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] Regions further south average [tpl]convert|38|to|42|C|F[/tpl] except when monsoonal cloud cover is active. Several people have died in this region after their vehicles have broken down on remote tracks.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] Winters are short and warm; temperatures range from [tpl]convert|25|to|30|C|F[/tpl].
Frost does not occur in most of the area. The regions bordering the Gibson Desert in the far south east may record a light frost or two every year.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] Away from the coast winter nights can still be chilly in comparison to the warm days.

==Economy==

Indigneous Art is a huge industry in central Australia. Mines, most importantly the Telfer gold mine and Nifty copper mine, and cattle stations are found in the far west. Telfer is one of the largest gold mines in Australia. The undeveloped Kintyre uranium deposit lies south of Telfer.

==Fauna and flora==

The vegetation of the Great Sandy Desert is dominated by spinifex.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Great_Sandy-Tanami_desert?topic=49597 |year= |title =Great Sandy-Tanami Desert |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Earth |publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment [/tpl]
Animals occurring in the region include feral camels, dingos, goannas (including the large Perentie) and numerous species of lizard and birds. Other animal inhabitants include Bilbies, Mulgara, Marsupial mole, Rufous hare-wallaby, Thorny Devils, Bearded Dragons, and the Red Kangaroo.
Some of the bird-life found within the desert include the rare Alexandra's Parrot, the Mulga Parrot and the Scarlet-chested Parrot.[tpl]NatGeo ecoregion|id=aa1304|name=Great Sandy-Tanami desert|accessdate=2010-08-30[/tpl]

==History==

The first European to cross the desert was Peter Warburton. He made the journey from Alice Springs leaving in April 1873 and arriving at De Grey Station in January 1874. Warburton arrived in a starved condition and blind in one eye. He attributed his survival to his Aboriginal companion Charley.[tpl]cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A060376b.htm|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography - Peter Warburton|year=2010|accessdate=2010-08-31[/tpl]
The historic Canning Stock Route traverses the southeastern portions of the Great Sandy Desert. Indigenous people were forcibly removed from the area due to Blue Streak missile tests in the 1950s.
