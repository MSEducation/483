==Top grossing films (U.S.)Box Office Digest, June 1943, p.18==

Box office numbers were reported at the time as a percentage compared to 'normal' business at each theater. For example, Mrs. Miniver performed at 244% while Billy Wilder's directorial debut The Major and the Minor did a solid 155%. This is why exact dollar grosses for the period are unreliable at best.
