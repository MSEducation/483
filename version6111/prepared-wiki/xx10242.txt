===Solar thermal===

The United States conducted much early research in photovoltaics and concentrated solar power. The U.S. is among the top countries in the world in electricity generated by the Sun and several of the world's largest utility-scale installations are located in the desert Southwest. The oldest solar power plant in the world is the 354 MW SEGS thermal power plant, in California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fplenergy.com/portfolio/contents/segs_viii.shtml |title=Segs Iii, Iv, V, Vi, Vii, Viii & Ix |publisher=Fplenergy.com |accessdate=2012-01-31[/tpl] The Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System is a solar thermal power project in the California Mojave Desert, 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Las Vegas, with a gross capacity of 392 megawatts (MW). The 280 MW Solana Generating Station is a solar power plant near Gila Bend, Arizona, about [tpl]convert|70|mi[/tpl] southwest of Phoenix, completed in 2013. When commissioned it was the largest parabolic trough plant in the world and the first U.S. solar plant with molten salt thermal energy storage.Mearian, Lucas.

===Photovoltaic power stations===

Solar photovoltaic cells (PV) convert sunlight into electricity and photovoltaic production has been increasing by an average of more than 20% each year since 2002, making it a fast-growing energy technology.James Russell. Record Growth in Photovoltaic Capacity and Momentum Builds for Concentrating Solar Power Vital Signs, June 3, 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/2639.html |title=Solar Expected to Maintain its Status as the World's Fastest-Growing Energy Technology |publisher=Socialfunds.com |date=2009-03-03 |accessdate=2011-11-21[/tpl] While wind is often cited as the fastest growing energy source, photovoltaics since 2007 has been increasing at twice the rate of wind — an average of 63.6%/year, due to the reduction in cost. At the end of 2011 the photovoltaic (PV) capacity world-wide was 67.4 GW, a 69.8% annual increase. Top capacity countries were, in GW: Germany 24.7, Italy 12.8, Japan 4.7, Spain 4.4, the USA 4.4, and China 3.1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://files.epia.org/files/Global-Market-Outlook-2016.pdf |title=Global Market Outlook 2016 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-11-01[/tpl]
Many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built, mainly in Europe.Denis Lenardic. Large-scale photovoltaic power plants ranking 1 - 50 PVresources.com, 2010. As of May 2012, the largest photovoltaic (PV) power plants in the world are the Agua Caliente Solar Project (USA, 247 MW), Charanka Solar Park (India, 214 MW), Golmud Solar Park (China, 200 MW), Perovo Solar Park (Ukraine, 100 MW), Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant (Canada, 97 MW), Brandenburg-Briest Solarpark (Germany, 91 MW), Solarpark Finow Tower (Germany, 84.7 MW), Montalto di Castro Photovoltaic Power Station (Italy, 84.2 MW), and the Eggebek Solar Park (Germany, 83.6 MW).
There are also many large plants under construction. The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550 MW solar power plant under construction in Riverside County, California, that will use thin-film solar photovoltaic modules made by First Solar.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/09/doe-closes-on-three-major-solar-projects?cmpid=SolarNL-Tuesday-October4-2011 |title=DOE Closes on Four Major Solar Projects  |author= |date= 30 September 2011 |work= Renewable Energy World [/tpl] The Topaz Solar Farm is a 550 MW photovoltaic power plant, being built in San Luis Obispo County, California.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/12/billionaire-buffett-bets-on-solar-energy?cmpid=SolarNL-Thursday-December8-2011 |title=Billionaire Buffett Bets on Solar Energy |author=Steve Leone |date=7 December 2011  |work=Renewable Energy World [/tpl] The Blythe Solar Power Project is a 500 MW photovoltaic station under construction in Riverside County, California.

Many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than fixed-mounted systems. There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations.
However, when it comes to renewable energy systems and PV, it is not just large systems that matter.  Building-integrated photovoltaics or "onsite" PV systems use existing land and structures and generate power close to where it is consumed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jcwinnie.biz/wordpress/?p=1724 |title=Solar Integrated in New Jersey |publisher=Jcwinnie.biz |accessdate=2013-08-20[/tpl]

===Biofuel development===

Biofuels provided 3% of the world's transport fuel in 2010. Mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states/provinces.  According to the International Energy Agency, biofuels have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/Oil/6017103 |title=IEA says biofuels can displace 27% of transportation fuels by 2050 Washington |author= |date=20 April 2011 |work=Platts [/tpl]
Since the 1970s, Brazil has had an ethanol fuel program which has allowed the country to become the world's second largest producer of ethanol (after the United States) and the world's largest exporter.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ethanolrfa.org/industry/statistics/#E|title=Industry Statistics: Annual World Ethanol Production by Country|publisher=Renewable Fuels Association|accessdate=2008-05-02|language= |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20080408091334/http://www.ethanolrfa.org/industry/statistics/#E  |archivedate = 2008-04-08[/tpl] Brazil’s ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap sugarcane as feedstock, and the residual cane-waste (bagasse) is used to produce heat and power.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eners.ch/plateforme/medias/macedo_2004.pdf |author= Macedo Isaias, M.

Nearly all the gasoline sold in the United States today is mixed with 10% ethanol, a mix known as E10,Erica Gies. As Ethanol Booms, Critics Warn of Environmental Effect The New York Times, June 24, 2010. and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. Ford, Daimler AG, and GM are among the automobile companies that sell “flexible-fuel” cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85). By mid-2006, there were approximately 6 million E85-compatible vehicles on U.S. roads.[tpl]cite web | title = American Energy: The Renewable Path to Energy Security  | publisher = Worldwatch Institute |date=September 2006 | url = http://images1.americanprogress.org/il80web20037/americanenergynow/AmericanEnergy.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-03-11[/tpl] The challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date. Flex-fuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which calls for [tpl]convert|7.5|e9USgal|m3[/tpl] of biofuels to be used annually by 2012, will also help to expand the market.

===Geothermal development===

Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly,William E. Glassley. Geothermal Energy: Renewable Energy and the Environment CRC Press, 2010. but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels.
The International Geothermal Association (IGA) has reported that 10,715 MW of geothermal power in 24 countries is online, which is expected to generate 67,246 GWh of electricity in 2010. This represents a 20% increase in geothermal power online capacity since 2005. IGA projects this will grow to 18,500 MW by 2015, due to the large number of projects presently under consideration, often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resource.Geothermal Energy Association. Geothermal Energy: International Market Update May 2010, p. 4-6.
In 2010, the United States led the world in geothermal electricity production with 3,086 MW of installed capacity from 77 power plants; the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at The Geysers, a geothermal field in California.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl][/ref] The Philippines follows the US as the second highest producer of geothermal power in the world, with 1,904 MW of capacity online; geothermal power makes up approximately 18% of the country's electricity generation.Geothermal Energy Association. Geothermal Energy: International Market Update - May 2010, p. 7

===Developing countries===

Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.Power for the People[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl] p. 3.
Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/39544/?p1=MstCom |title=In the Developing World, Solar Is Cheaper than Fossil Fuels |author=Kevin Bullis |date=January 27, 2012 |work=Technology Review [/tpl] An estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems.REN21 (2010). Renewables 2010 Global Status Report[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl] p. 12. Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. Some Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability.Fry, Carolyn. 28 June 2012. Anguilla moves towards cleaner energy
Micro-hydro configured into mini-grids also provide power. Over 44 million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and/or cooking, and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves. Clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas of the developing world. Alcohol fuels (ethanol and methanol) can be produced sustainably from non-food sugary, starchy, and cellulostic feedstocks. Project Gaia, Inc. and CleanStar Mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and Mozambique.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projectgaia.com/page.php?page=ethiopia |title=Ethiopia |publisher=Projectgaia.com |accessdate=2012-11-01[/tpl]
Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to poverty reduction by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting. Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools.Energy for Development: The Potential Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals pp. 7-9.

===Industry and policy trends===

U.S. President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes more than $70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs. Clean Edge suggests that the commercialization of clean energy will help countries around the world pull out of the current economic malaise.Joel Makower, Ron Pernick and Clint Wilder (2009). Clean Energy Trends 2009, Clean Edge, pp. 1-4. Leading renewable energy companies include First Solar, Gamesa, GE Energy, Q-Cells, Sharp Solar, Siemens, SunOpta, Suntech Power, and Vestas.REN21 (2008). Renewables 2007 Global Status Report (PDF) p. 18.
The military has also focused on the use of renewable fuels for military vehicles. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable fuels can be produced in any country, creating a strategic advantage. The US military has already committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources.[tpl]cite web |url= http://nextnavy.com/air-force-cedes-the-green-lead-and-the-lede-to-navy/ |title=Air Force cedes the Green lead–and the lede–to Navy |first=Craig |last=Hooper |work=nextnavy.com |year=2011 |accessdate=December 27, 2011[/tpl]
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide.  It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer. IRENA was formed on January 26, 2009, by 75 countries signing the charter of IRENA.Signatory States[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] As of March 2010, IRENA has 143 member states who all are considered as founding members, of which 14 have also ratified the statute.Signatories of IRENA’s statute[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
As of 2011, 119 countries have some form of national renewable energy policy target or renewable support policy. National targets now exist in at least 98 countries. There is also a wide range of policies at state/provincial and local levels.
United Nations' Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity. In October 2011, he "announced the creation of a high-level group to drum up support for energy access, energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy. The group is to be co-chaired by Kandeh Yumkella, the chair of UN Energy and director general of the UN Industrial Development Organisation, and Charles Holliday, chairman of Bank of America".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/nov/02/human-development-report-renewable-energy |title=UN calls for universal access to renewable energy |author=Mark Tran |date=2 November 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London[/tpl]

==Emerging technologies==

Other renewable energy technologies are still under development, and include cellulosic ethanol, hot-dry-rock geothermal power, and ocean energy.[ref]International Energy Agency (2007).
Renewables in global energy supply: An IEA facts sheet[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl] (PDF), OECD, p. 3.[/ref] These technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization. Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies, but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research, development and demonstration (RD&D) funding.
There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy. This research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum. Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields.[tpl]cite journal | title = Increasing the energy yield of generation from new and renewable energy sources | journal = Renewable energy | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | pages = 37–62 | author = S.C.E.

===Cellulosic ethanol===

Companies such as Iogen, POET, and Abengoa are building refineries that can process biomass and turn it into ethanol, while companies such as the Verenium Corporation, Novozymes, and Dyadic International are producing enzymes which could enable a cellulosic ethanol future.  The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors.Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007).

Carbon-neutral fuels offer relatively low cost energy storage, alleviating the problems of wind and solar intermittency, and they enable distribution of wind, water, and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines. Nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel, because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day, but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day, so, the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative. Germany has built a 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts.[tpl]cite web |author= Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Württemberg |year= 2011 |title= Verbundprojekt 'Power-to-Gas' |language= German |publisher= zsw-bw.de |url= http://www.zsw-bw.de/themen/brennstoffe-wasserstoff/power-to-gas.html |accessdate= September 9, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |author= Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research |date= July 24, 2012 |title= Bundesumweltminister Altmaier und Ministerpräsident Kretschmann zeigen sich beeindruckt von Power-to-Gas-Anlage des ZSW |language= German |publisher= zsw-bw.de |url= http://www.zsw-bw.de/infoportal/aktuelles/aktuelles-detail/hochrangige-politiker-lobten-zsw-innovationen.html |accessdate= September 9, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |author= Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft |date= May 5, 2010 |title= Storing green electricity as natural gas |publisher= fraunhofer.de |url= http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2010/04/green-electricity-storage-gas.html |accessdate= September 9, 2012[/tpl]

===Marine energy===

Marine energy (also sometimes referred to as ocean energy) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and ocean temperature differences. The movement of water in the world’s oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy, or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries.
The term marine energy encompasses both wave power — power from surface waves, and tidal power — obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water.
The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.Carbon Trust, Future Marine Energy. Results of the Marine Energy Challenge: Cost competitiveness and growth of wave and tidal stream energy, January 2006

===Enhanced geothermal systems===

Enhanced geothermal systems are a new type of geothermal power technologies that do not require natural convective hydrothermal resources. The vast majority of geothermal energy within drilling reach is in dry and non-porous rock.[tpl]Cite news | last1 = Duchane | first1 = Dave | last2 = Brown | first2 = Don | date =December 2002 | title =Hot Dry Rock (HDR) Geothermal Energy Research and Development at Fenton Hill, New Mexico | periodical =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | publication-place =Klamath Falls, Oregon | publisher =Oregon Institute of Technology | volume =23 | issue =4 | pages = 13–19 | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/bulletin/bull23-4/art4.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2009-05-05 | postscript = [/tpl] EGS technologies "enhance" and/or create geothermal resources in this "hot dry rock (HDR)" through hydraulic stimulation.
EGS / HDR technologies, like hydrothermal geothermal, are expected to be baseload resources which produce power 24 hours a day like a fossil plant. Distinct from hydrothermal, HDR / EGS may be feasible anywhere in the world, depending on the economic limits of drill depth.  Good locations are over deep granite covered by a thick (3–5 km) layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss.20 slide presentation inc geothermal maps of Australia[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] There are HDR and EGS systems currently being developed and tested in France, Australia, Japan, Germany, the U.S. and Switzerland.  The largest EGS project in the world is a 25 megawatt demonstration plant currently being developed in the Cooper Basin, Australia.  The Cooper Basin has the potential to generate 5,000–10,000 MW.

===Experimental solar power===

Concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of electricity generation. Thermoelectric, or "thermovoltaic" devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current.

===Artificial photosynthesis===

Artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol.Collings AF and Critchley C (eds). Artificial Photosynthesis- From Basic Biology to Industrial Application (Wiley-VCH Weinheim 2005) p ix. Researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that utilize a wider region of the solar spectrum, employ catalytic systems made from abundant, inexpensive materials that are robust, readily repaired, non-toxic, stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds, i.e., carbohydrates (rather than building and sustaining living cells).[tpl]cite journal|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/ee/c3ee00063j |title=Energy and environment policy case for a global project on artificial photosynthesis |journal= Energy & Environmental Science  |publisher=RSC Publishing |accessdate=2013-08-19[/tpl] However, prominent research faces hurdles, Sun Catalytix a MIT spin-off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel-cell in 2012, because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight.[tpl]cite web|author=jobs |url=http://www.nature.com/news/artificial-leaf-faces-economic-hurdle-1.10703 |title='Artificial leaf' faces economic hurdle : Nature News & Comment |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate=2012-11-07[/tpl]

==Renewable energy debate==

Renewable electricity production, from sources such as wind power and solar power, is sometimes criticized for being variable or intermittent. However, the International Energy Agency has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks.International Energy Agency (2007). Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl] IEA Information Paper, p. 5.
There have been "not in my back yard" (NIMBY) concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some wind farms, with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/080114-wind-energy.html |title=Whatever Happened to Wind Energy? |publisher=LiveScience |date=14 January 2008 |accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl] In the USA, the Massachusetts Cape Wind project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns. However, residents in other areas have been more positive. According to a town councilor, the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the Ardrossan Wind Farm in Scotland has enhanced the area.[tpl]cite news|author=Simon Gourlay |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/windpower.alternativeenergy |title=Wind farms are not only beautiful, they're absolutely necessary |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=17 January 2012 |date=2008-08-12[/tpl]
A recent UK Government document states that “projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities. This means giving communities both a say and a stake”.Department of Energy & Climate Change (2011). UK Renewable Energy Roadmap (PDF) p. 35. In countries such as Germany and Denmark many renewable projects are owned by communities, particularly through cooperative structures, and contribute significantly to overall levels of renewable energy deployment.DTI, Co-operative Energy: Lessons from Denmark and Sweden, Report of a DTI Global Watch Mission, October 2004Morris C & Pehnt M, German Energy Transition: Arguments for a Renewable Energy Future, Heinrich Böll Foundation, November 2012
The market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow. Climate change concerns, coupled with high oil prices, peak oil, and increasing government support, are driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and commercialization. New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors.Clean Edge (2009). Clean Energy Trends 2009 pp. 1–4.
