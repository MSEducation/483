Warsaw has seen major infrastructural changes over the past few years amidst increased foreign investment and economic growth. The city has a much improved infrastructure with new healthcare facilities, sanitation, etc.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |author=Michal Jeziorski |url=http://www.warsawvoice.pl/view/14144|title=Improving Infrastructure |work=www.warsawvoice.pl |publisher= |pages= |page= |date=7 March 2007 |accessdate=28 May 2009[/tpl]

==Streets and Thoroughfares==

Traditionally the streets in Warsaw, unlike in many other cities in Poland, are named with adjective forms rather than in simple nouns in nominative case. For instance, the street named after Saint John is named Świętojańska (literally Saintjohnian Street) in Warsaw and Święty Jan (Saint John) in Poznań. In modern times the tradition is not closely observed and most streets named after personalities or groups are named with nouns in genitive case, thus the forms correspond roughly to the English prepositional phrases (Polish Plac Zwycięstwa means literally Square of Victory rather than Victory Square).

==Sanitation==

===Water supply===

Three supply systems serve Warsaw inhabitants. Wodociąg Centralny (Central Water Main) is the oldest.[tpl]pl icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |author= |url=http://www.e-warsaw.pl/2/index.php?id=582 |title=Technical infrastructure |work=www.e-warsaw.pl |publisher= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2009-05-28[/tpl] It was built in 19th century. After many renovations, it is still functioning and providing water for more than half of Warsaw's residents. The other supply systems are Wodociąg Praski (Praga Water Main) and Wodociąg Północny (Northern Water Main).

===Sewerage===

Warsaw's sewer system was installed in the second half of the 19th century, at the same time as the water supply system. Currently the waste water collectors are 2,020 km long and serve over 90 percent of inhabitants. A new sewage treatment plant is planned for the south of the city on the left river bank.

==Health system==

The first hospital in Warsaw was established in 1353 by duke Siemowit III and his wife Eufemia and named after the Holy Spirit intra muros.[tpl]pl icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |author=Janusz Grabowski |url=http://papiez.polska.pl/archiwa/gallery,Bulla_Eugeniusza_IV_w_sprawie_kupna_placu_dla_zakonu_augustianow_w_Warszawie_z_dnia_30_III_1444_roku,gid,162067,cid,540.htm?body=desc |title=Bulla Eugeniusza IV w sprawie kupna placu dla zakonu augustianów w Warszawie z dnia 30 III 1444 roku |work=papiez.polska.pl |publisher= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2009-05-18[/tpl][tpl]pl icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book | author = | coauthors = | title = Warszawa w latach 1526-1795 (Warsaw in 1526-1795) | year = 1984 | editor = Stefan Kieniewicz | page =105 | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher = | location =Warsaw | id =ISBN 83-01033-23-1 | url = | format = | accessdate = [/tpl] In 1571, the famous Wojciech Oczko, an author of extensive treatises on balneology and syphilidology, was made a doctor there.

Warsaw is home to the Children's Memorial Health Institute (CMHI), the highest-reference hospital for all of Poland, as well as an active research and education center.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |author=Ewa Pronicka and coordinators |url=http://www.warsawvoice.pl/view/5508/ |title=Perfect for Children |work=www.warsawvoice.pl |publisher= |pages= |page= |date=27 April 2004 |accessdate=2009-03-02[/tpl] CMHI was founded by Poles living in Poland and abroad in 1968.

Although the healthcare system in Poland is free for persons covered by the general health insurance,[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |author=|url=http://travel.poland.com/texts/en/t-pi-4-2.php |title=HEALTH CARE IN POLAND |work=travel.poland.com |publisher= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2009-03-02[/tpl] it is sometimes slow.
