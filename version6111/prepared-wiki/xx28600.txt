</ref> Most testimony of the 5th century, for instance [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Jerome]], is to the effect that Jesus wrote nothing. The correspondence was rejected as [[apocryphal]] by [[Pope Gelasius I]] and a Roman synod (c. 495).<ref name="Chisholm"/> Biblical scholars now generally believe that the letters were fabricated, probably in the 3rd century AD, and "planted" where Eusebius eventually found them. Another theory is that the story was fabricated by [[Abgar IX of Osroene]], during whose reign the kingdom became Christianized, as a way of legitimizing its religious conversion.
The text of the letter varies. The less available variant, transcribed from the Doctrina Addaei, and printed in the Catholic Encyclopedia 1908, is: 
The Doctrina then continues:
(†According to Eusebius, Jesus himself wrote the letter; nothing is mentioned of his having dictated it to Hannan.)

==Liturgical use of the letter of Abgar==

The quotations paraphrasing the Gospels are actually from the famous gospel harmony by Tatian, the Diatessaron, itself compiled in the 2nd century.Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005
In addition to the importance it attained in the apocryphal cycle, the correspondence of King Abgar also gained a place in liturgy for some time. The decree, De libris non recipiendis ("Books not to be received"), traditionally attributed to Pope Gelasius I, places the letter among the apocrypha. That in itself may be an indication of its having been interpolated among the officially sanctioned lessons of the liturgy of some churches. The Syriac liturgies commemorate the correspondence of Abgar during Lent. The Celtic liturgy appears to have attached importance to the legend; the Liber Hymnorum, a manuscript preserved at Trinity College, Dublin (E. 4, 2), gives two collects on the lines of the letter to Abgar. It is even possible that this letter, followed by various prayers, may have formed a minor liturgical office in some Catholic churches.Leclercq, Henri. "The Legend of Abgar." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 24 Dec. 2012

==True images==

The account given by Thaddeus/Addai contains a detail that may be briefly referred to. Hannan, who wrote at Jesus' dictation, was archivist at Edessa and painter to King Abgar. He had been charged to paint a portrait of Jesus Christ, and brought to Edessa an icon that became an object of general veneration, and that was eventually said to have been painted (or created miraculously) by Jesus himself. Like the letter, the iconic portrait was destined be the nucleus of a legendary growth; the "Holy Face of Edessa" was chiefly famous in the Byzantine world, where the legend of the Edessa portrait forms part of the subject of the iconography of Christ, and also of the pictures of miraculous origin called acheiropoietoe ("made without hands") both in the Eastern Orthodox Church and, in the West where the tradition is associated with St. Veronica and Veronica's Veil and the Shroud of Turin.

==Christian legacy==

Abgar is counted as saint, with feasts on May 11 and October 28 in the Eastern Orthodox Church, August 1 in the Syrian Church, and daily in the Mass of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The Armenian Apostolic Church in Scottsdale, Arizona, is named after Saint Abgar (known also as Saint Apkar).
On August 24, 2009, the board of the Central Bank of Armenia adopted a decision on introducing a new banknote with a nominal value of AMD 100,000. The new banknote depicts King Abgar V (King of Armenian Mesopotamia as described). The front of the banknote depicts Abgar pointing at the royal flag bearing an image of the Mandylion. The reverse of the banknote depicts disciple Thaddaeus handing the canvas to King Abgar V and his consequent miraculous healing.[tpl]cite web | title = CBA issues 100,000 Dram banknotes | url = http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/print/?nid=35536 | publisher = PanArmenian News | accessdate = 2009-08-24[/tpl]

==The historicity of the Abgar legend==

The Abgar legend has played an important part in the self-definition of several Eastern churches, but its historicity is extremely doubtful.  Two recent histories of the Church of the East, Baum and Winkler's The Church of the East and David Wilmshurst's The Martyred Church, have addressed this issue and have discussed the growth and development of the legend.Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 7-9 Alexander Mirkovic also argued against the historicity of the legend, pointing out at that the legend is not the only one of its genre. There were many conversion stories coming out of the Middle East in the 3rd and 4th centuries. In many ways these stories represent a model for the conversion of Constantine.Alexander Mirkovic, Prelude to Constantine: The Abgar Tradition in Early Christianity. Berlin and New York: Peter Land, 2004
(Notice the similarity between the Book of Abgar and the conversion of Helena of Adiabene and her son Ezad II in Flavius Josephus: Jewish Antiquities, XX 2. In the story told by Josephus there is a Jewish merchant by the name Ananias and the question is of circumcision of Ezad.)
In the Book of Abgar, Ananias is the messenger sent by King Abgar to Jesus. Ezad’s son was Abgar VII of Edessa (Ostroene). The origin of the story may be that Ezad, the father of Abgar VII, had exchanged letters with somebody in Jerusalem, but more probably with the Nasi Gamaliel than with Jesus.Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard Mercer Dictionary of the Bible 1990 p. 2 "Abgar Legend, ab'gahr The Abgar legend concerns a supposed exchange of letters between King Abgar V of Edessa (9—46 c.e.) and Jesus, and the subsequent evangelization of Edessa by the apostle Thaddeus"
