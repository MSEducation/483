[[Ununennium]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Alkali metals, Hypothetical chemical elements

Ununennium, also known as eka-francium or element 119, is the temporary name of a chemical element in the periodic table that has the temporary symbol Uue and has the atomic number 119. To date, attempted syntheses of this element have been unsuccessful.  Since it is below the alkali metals it might have properties similar to those of francium or caesium and thus be extremely reactive with water and air (though relativistic effects might make it less reactive than francium and caesium). A predicted oxidation state is +1; however, unlike all the other alkali metals, it is also predicted to show the +3 oxidation state.
Ununennium would be the first element in the eighth period of the periodic table.

==Attempts at synthesis==

The synthesis of ununennium was attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium-254 with calcium-48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley, California:

As of May 2012, plans are under way to attempt to synthesize the isotopes 295Uue and 296Uue by bombarding a target of berkelium with titanium at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany:Modern alchemy: Turning a line, The Economist, May 12, 2012.Düllmann, Christoph E.

==Predicted decay characteristics==

The alpha-decay half-lives of 1700 nuclei with 100 ≤ Z ≤ 130 have been calculated in a quantum tunneling model with alpha-decay Q-values from different mass estimates.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Nucl.

The highest value of the alpha-decay half-life predicted in the quantum tunneling model with the mass estimates from a macroscopic-microscopic model is ~485 microseconds for the isotope 294119. For 302119 it is ~163 microseconds.

==Extrapolated chemical properties==

Ununennium is expected to behave normally for an alkali metal and exhibit a strong +1 oxidation state. However, the energetic properties of its valence electron would increase its first ionization energy, making it less reactive than expected and more like potassium than caesium chemically. This would also decrease the metallic and ionic radii of ununennium.[tpl]cite web|author=Seaborg|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/603220/transuranium-element|title=transuranium element (chemical element)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=c. 2006|accessdate=2010-03-16[/tpl] Ununennium is also predicted to be the first alkali metal to display the +3 oxidation state, due to the ionization energy of the 7p3/2 electrons, which is predicted to be very low.
