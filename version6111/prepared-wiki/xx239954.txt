==History==

Portland area voters approved a bond measure in 1995 that provided funding for the purchase of greenspaces by Metro.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/washingtoncounty/index.ssf/2009/06/from_stumps_to_spectacular.html|title=From stumps to spectacular|last=Uno|first=Wesley|date=June 25, 2009|work=The Oregonian|accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl] Metro covers most of Washington, Clackamas, and Multnomah counties in the northwest part of Oregon. Metro began buying land on Cooper Mountain near Aloha and Beaverton in 1997, and spent $6.58 million in total on land.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/news/argus/index.ssf?/base/news/1241549454194680.xml&coll=6|title=Mountain preserve set to open June 27|date=May 5, 2009 |work=The Hillsboro Argus|accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl] Voters approved an additional bond in 2006, and Metro spent almost $2 million from that bond on facilities at Cooper Mountain. Metro also received a $500,000 grant from the Oregon Department of Parks and Recreation and a $40,000 grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for development of the park. To prepare the area for the park and help restore the native habitat, the area was burned in 2008. Cooper Mountain Nature Park opened on June 27, 2009. Through 2009, volunteers and Metro planted approximately 100,000 shrubs and trees at the park.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/washingtoncounty/index.ssf/2010/01/park_to_host_saturday_educatio.html|title=Park to host Saturday educational open house|last=Gregory|first=Roger|date=January 20, 2010|work=The Oregonian|accessdate=18 February 2010[/tpl]
