Security Armored Express, Inc. was an armored car and courier provider for the Western United States.  Its corporate office was located in Helena, Montana.
Founded in 1980 by David Blatter with a single armored car in Missoula, Montana, the company now stretches throughout the western US, providing service to Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, North Dakota, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington state.  
David Blatter retired in 1992 from the company, and his wife, Terri, began running the company with the help of stepson Bryan Sandrock, and son Mark Blatter. Mark left the company in 2004 and two years later, in April 2006, the company was acquired by Garda World Security Corporation for an undisclosed amount. This is Garda's second armored car company acquisition in the United States following the purchase of United Armored Services in 2005 which services the Midwestern United States.
Prior to its acquisition by Garda, the company had an active local and national presence, participating in local events such as parades and Laurel, Montana's Aviation and Technology Week. Additionally, Security Armored was an active member of the Independent Armored Car Owners Association (IACOA).
