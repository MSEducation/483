Coors Field is a baseball venue located in Denver, Colorado. It is the home field of Major League Baseball's Colorado Rockies. It is named for the Coors Brewing Company of Golden, Colorado, which purchased the naming rights to the park prior to its completion in 1995. The Rockies played their first two seasons, 1993 and 1994, in Mile High Stadium before moving to Coors Field, two blocks from Union Station in Denver's Lower Downtown (or LoDo) neighborhood. The park includes 63 luxury suites and 4,526 club seats.

==Construction==

Coors Field was the first new stadium added in a six-year period in which Denver's sports venues were upgraded, along with Pepsi Center and Sports Authority Field at Mile High (originally sponsored by INVESCO). It was also the first baseball-only National League Park since Dodger Stadium was built in 1962. When Marlins Park opened in 2012, Coors Field became the third oldest stadium in the National League, despite its relatively young age.
As with the other new venues, Coors Field was constructed with accessibility in mind. It sits near Interstate 25 and has direct access to the 20th Street and Park Avenue exits. Nearby Union Station also provides light rail access.
Coors Field was originally planned to be somewhat smaller, seating only 43,800. However, after the Rockies drew almost 4.5 million people in their first season at Mile High Stadium - the most in baseball history - the plans were altered during construction, and new seats in the right field upper deck were added.
The center field bleacher section has its own informal name: "The Rockpile."  During the 1993 and 1994 seasons when the team played at Mile High Stadium, which was a hybrid football/baseball venue, the Rockpile was located next to the south stands, which were in dead center field and very distant from home plate.  The same design was incorporated into Coors Field, and is located in deep center field up high.  The original Rockpile seats cost a dollar each.
During construction, workers discovered a number of dinosaur fossils throughout the grounds, including a [tpl]convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-long[/tpl] [tpl]convert|1000|lb|kg|adj=on[/tpl] triceratops skull. Because of this, "Jurassic Park" was one of the first names to be considered for the stadium. This later led to the selection of a dinosaur as the Rockies' mascot, "Dinger."

Coors Field was the first major league park with an underground heating system.

==Features==

While most of the seats in Coors Field are dark green, the seats in the 20th row of the upper deck are purple. This marks the city's one mile elevation point.
The Blue Moon Brewery at The Sandlot is a microbrewery/restaurant that is behind the Right Field Stands, with an entrance from Coors Field, and from Blake Street. The brewery is operated by the Coors Brewing Company, and experiments with craft beers on a small scale. The Brewery has won multiple awards at the Great American Beer Festival in various categories. The popular Blue Moon, a Belgian-Style Wheat beer was invented here, and is now mass-produced by Coors. The restaurant is housed in a building that is attached to the stadium. Coors Field has an extensive selection of food items. Selections include sushi, Rocky Mountain oysters, Rockie dogs, Denver dogs, Tucson dogs, vegetarian dogs and burgers, and of course all of the usual ball park items.
Behind the center field wall is a landscape decoration that reflects the typical environment of the Rocky Mountains. This landscape area consists of a waterfall, fountains, and pine trees.  After a Rockies home run or win the fountains shoot high into the air.
The park has two large light emitting diode (LED) video displays and one ribbon display in the outfield from Daktronics. The top display, underneath the "Rockies" logo, measures 27 feet high by 47 feet wide (8.1 m x 14.35 m). The second display measure 33 feet high by 73 feet wide and is used to give lineups and statistics and as a scoreboard. The field also contains several Daktronics ribbon displays, totaling approximately 833 feet in length.[tpl]cite web |title=Colorado Rockies, Coors Field|url=http://www.daktronics.com/ProductsServices/PhotoGallery/Pages/default.aspx?photoID=WP-12478&keywords=colorado%20rockies&filters|publisher=Daktronics|accessdate=March 16, 2013[/tpl]
After the close of the 2013 season, renovations began on the right field portion of the upper deck. This part of the deck is being renovated into an outdoor party deck, which is to be ready for Opening Day 2014.[tpl]cite web |title=Rooftop Deck|url=http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/col/ballpark/rooftop_deck.jsp|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media|accessdate=April 4, 2014[/tpl]

===Reputation as a home run-friendly park===

Stadium designers speculated early on that Coors Field would give up a lot of home runs.  It is by far the highest park in the majors, and designers knew that the low air density at such a high elevation would result in balls traveling farther than in other parks.  With this in mind, the outfield fences were placed at an unusually far distance from home plate; thus creating one of the largest outfields in baseball today. Because of the large outfield, for many years Coors Field not only gave up the most home runs in baseball, but gave up the most doubles and triples as well.[tpl]cite book |last=Lowry|first=Phillip|title=Green Cathedrals|year=2005|publisher=Walker & Company|location=New York City|isbn=0-8027-1562-1[/tpl]
In its first decade, the above-average number of home runs earned Coors Field a reputation as the most hitter-friendly park in Major League Baseball, earning the critical nicknames "Coors Canaveral"[tpl]cite news |title=Opening Shots|first=Jim|last=Armstrong|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&p_theme=dp&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF452D7534A60D&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=June 13, 1999|accessdate=June 5, 2012[/tpl] (a reference to Cape Canaveral, from where NASA launches spacecraft) and   "Williamsport" (referring to the site of the Little League World Series). Prior to the 2002 baseball season, studies determined that it was more the dry air rather than thin air which contributed to the more frequent home runs.  It was found that baseballs stored in drier air are harder and therefore more elastic to the impact of the bat.  A room-sized humidor was installed in which to store the baseballs, and since its introduction the number of home runs at Coors Field has decreased and is now nearly the same as other parks.[tpl]cite news |title=More Humidors Likely on Horizon|first=Troy E.|last=Renck|url=http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_3961497|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=June 21, 2006|accessdate=June 12, 2007[/tpl]
Regardless of ball humidity, elevation is still a factor to the game.  The ball does slip easier through the thin air allowing for longer hits.  In addition, the curveball tends to curve less with the thin air than at sea level leading to fewer strikeouts and fewer effective pitches for pitchers to work with.[tpl]cite web |title=What to pack for Denver|first=Josh|last=Kalk|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/what-to-pack-for-denver/|work=Hardball Times|date=June 17, 2008|accessdate=March 16, 2013[/tpl]
Coors Field twice broke the major league record for home runs hit in a ballpark in one season. The previous record, 248, had been set at the Angels' original home of Wrigley Field in Los Angeles in 1961, its only year for major league ball. In Coors Field's first year, the home run total fell just 7 short of that mark, despite losing 9 games from the home schedule (or one-ninth of the normal 81) due to the strike that had continued from 1994. The next season, 1996, with a full schedule finally, 271 home runs were hit at Coors Field. In 1999, the current major league record was set at 303. The annual home run figure dropped noticeably in 2002, and have dropped below 200 starting in 2005.[tpl]cite web |title=Coors Field in Denver, Colorado|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/D/PK_DEN02.htm|publisher=Retrosheet|accessdate=March 16, 2013[/tpl]

==The "Voice" of Coors Field==

Alan Roach was the main PA announcer since Coors Field opened in 1995.

He did come back to substitute  in 2008. Roach is also the PA announcer for the nearby Colorado Avalanche hockey team of the NHL and the Denver Broncos of the NFL.
