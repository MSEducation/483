==Design and development==

===Columbia 300===

Developed as the Model LC40-550FG (for Lancair Certified, Model 40, Continental 550 engine, Fixed Gear) and marketed under the name Columbia 300, the aircraft was certified on September 18, 1998.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/2c9a807e8a15cec9862573d20051899d/$FILE/A00003SE.pdf|title = TYPE CERTIFICATE DATA SHEET A00003SE Revision 22|accessdate = 2008-09-23|last = Federal Aviation Administration|authorlink = |date=January 2008[/tpl]

The 300 has a certified airframe life of 25,200 flight hours.

===Columbia 350===

The Columbia 300 was upgraded with a glass cockpit and other improvements developed for the turbocharged Columbia 400. It was certified on March 30, 2003 as the Model LC42-550FG (for Lancair Certified, Model 42, Continental 550 engine, Fixed Gear) and marketed as the Columbia 350.
Like the 300, the 350 is powered by a Teledyne Continental IO-550-N powerplant producing 310 horsepower (230 kW) at 2700 rpm. The 350 has the same take-off and landing weights as the 300; maximum take-off weight is 3400 lbs (1542 kg) and the maximum landing weight is 3230 lbs (1465 kg).
Like the 300 and 400, the 350 has a certified airframe life of 25200 flight hours.
Initially sold simply as the Cessna 350, the aircraft was given the marketing name Corvalis by Cessna on 14 January 2009. The name is a derivation of the town of Corvallis, Oregon which is west of the Bend, Oregon location of the Cessna plant that built the aircraft, prior to closing the plant and relocating production to Independence, Kansas in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.cessna.com/NewReleases/FeaturedNews/NewReleaseNumber-1192260253604.html|title = Cessna Debuts 350 Corvalis and 400 Corvalis TT|accessdate = 2009-01-17|last = Cessna |authorlink = |date=January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaWillSuspendColumbusProgramAndCloseBendFactory_200284-1.html|title = Cessna Will Suspend Columbus Program, Close Bend Factory|accessdate = 2009-04-30|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |date=April 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.flyingmag.com/news/1510/cessna-closes-oregon-factory-suspends-large-jet-program.html|title = Cessna Closes Oregon Factory; Suspends Large-Jet Program|accessdate = 2009-05-11|last = Phelps|first = Mark|authorlink = |date=May 2009[/tpl]
In April 2009 Cessna announced that it would close the Bend, Oregon factory where the Cessna 350 was produced and move production to Independence, Kansas, with the composite construction moved to Mexico. The production line was restarted in October, 2009 in the Cessna Independence paint facility, at a rate of one aircraft per six months initially. This was to allow the new workers, plus the 30 employees transferred from Bend, to gain experience and also allow Cessna the opportunity to retail its unsold inventory of Cessna 350s and 400s. The company had anticipated moving the 350/400 production into a permanent facility by the end of 2009.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_corvalis_production_201287-1.htmll|title = Cessna Resumes Corvalis Production, Not In Bend |accessdate = 2009-10-12|last = Pew|first = Glenn|authorlink = |date=October 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In December 2010 a Cessna 400 that was being test flown at the factory developed a fuel leak, the cause of which was determined to be that the aircraft had "suffered a significant structural failure in the wing during a production acceptance flight test. The wing skin disbonded from the upper forward wing spar. The length of the disbond was approximately 7 feet." As a result the FAA issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive affecting seven Cessna 400s and one 350, all on the production line. The AD did not affect any customer aircraft in service, but did delay deliveries.[tpl]Cite news|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/Composite_Issue_Stops_Corvalis_Deliveries_203778-1.html|title = Composite Issue Stops Corvalis Deliveries|accessdate = 13 December 2010|last = Niles|first = Russ|authorlink = |date=December 2010| work = AvWeb[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url = http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAD.nsf/0/4E1AE86FA2B07CD5862577F50076B24E?OpenDocument |title = Airworthiness Directive AD 2010-26-53 |accessdate = 13 December 2010|last = Federal Aviation Administration |authorlink = |date=December 2010[/tpl]
