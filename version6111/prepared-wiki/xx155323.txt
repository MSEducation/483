Avant Window Navigator (abbreviated AWN or Awn) is a dock-like bar for Linux, which sits on an edge of a user's screen and tracks open windows. Instead of representing open windows as buttons or segments on a bar, it uses icons to minimize screen space and add visual appeal. Avant Window Navigator was created by Neil J. Patel and is currently in the beta stages of development.
Both the appearance and functionality of Avant Window Navigator may be customized, and plugins and applets are available, such as to display the progress of a download in Mozilla Firefox or to control a music player like Rhythmbox.Awn Extras  The plugins use the D-Bus IPC system, and applets can be written in C, Python, or Vala. There is a sister project, AWN Extras, which is a collection of community-contributed applets and plugins.  Its releases are usually kept in sync with AWN.
One of the major requirements to run older versions of Avant Window Navigator is a compositing window manager. At least version 0.4.0-2 in the Debian repos, has either Metacity, or xcompmgr, or Compiz, or xfwm4, or KWin, or Mutter as a dependency.[tpl]cite web |url=https://packages.debian.org/squeeze/avant-window-navigator |title=Avant Window Navigator as Debian package[/tpl]
Therefore, the user was required to install a compositor,Installation (Prerequisites) - AWN Wiki such as Compiz, which could tax performance on low-end systems. Some alternatives were to use Xfce, which has a compositing manager since version 4.2.0, or to enable compositing in Metacity when using GNOME.Enabling compositing with Metacity However, support for non-composited environments is available in version 0.4.0.Milestone 0.4 for AwnOfficial release blog post
