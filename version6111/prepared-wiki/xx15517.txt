Edward Teller ([tpl]lang-hu|Teller Ede[/tpl]; January 15, 1908 – September 9, 2003) was a Hungarian-born American theoretical physicist[tpl]cite book |last=Heilbron |first=ed. by J.

(Teller, Memoirs, p. 546.) is known colloquially as "the father of the hydrogen bomb". He made numerous contributions to nuclear and molecular physics, spectroscopy (in particular, the Jahn–Teller and Renner–Teller effects) and surface physics. His extension of Enrico Fermi's theory of beta decay, in the form of the so-called Gamow–Teller transitions, provided an important stepping stone in its application, while the Jahn–Teller effect and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry.Goodchild 2005, p. 36. Teller also made contributions to Thomas–Fermi theory, the precursor of density functional theory, a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules. In 1953, along with Nicholas Metropolis and Marshall Rosenbluth, Teller co-authored a paper[tpl]cite journal |last1=Metropolis |first1=Nicholas |authorlink1=Nicholas Metropolis |last2=Rosenbluth |first2=Arianna W. |last3=Rosenbluth |first3=Marshall N. |authorlink3=Marshall Rosenbluth |last4=Teller |first4=Augusta H. |last5=Teller |first5=Edward |authorlink5=Edward Teller |year=1953  |title=Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines |journal=Journal of Chemical Physics |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=1087–1092 |issn=0021-9606 |doi=10.1063/1.1699114 |bibcode=1953JChPh..21.1087M[/tpl] which is a standard starting point for the applications of the Monte Carlo method to statistical mechanics.
Teller emigrated to the United States in the 1930s, and was an early member of the Manhattan Project charged with developing the first atomic bombs. During this time he made a serious push to develop the first fusion-based weapons as well, but these were deferred until after World War II. After his controversial testimony in the security clearance hearing of his former Los Alamos colleague J. Robert Oppenheimer, Teller was ostracized by much of the scientific community. He continued to find support from the U.S. government and military research establishment, particularly for his advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program. He was a co-founder of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and was both its director and associate director for many years.
In his later years, Teller became especially known for his advocacy of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including a plan to excavate an artificial harbor in Alaska using thermonuclear explosive in what was called Project Chariot. He was a vigorous advocate of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. Throughout his life, Teller was known both for his scientific ability and his difficult interpersonal relations and volatile personality, and is considered one of the inspirations for the character Dr. Strangelove in the 1964 movie of the same name.

==Early life and education==

Teller was born in Budapest, Hungary (then Austria-Hungary), into a Jewish family, in the year 1908. His parents were Ilona (née Deutsch), a pianist, and Max Teller, an attorney.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/10/us/edward-teller-is-dead-at-95-fierce-architect-of-h-bomb.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | work=The New York Times | title=Edward Teller Is Dead at 95; Fierce Architect of H-Bomb | date=September 10, 2003[/tpl] When he was very young, his grandfather told his mother not to be too unhappy that he was apparently an idiot, because he hadn't spoken by the age of three. A doctor suggested he might be mentally retarded. Teller had no interest in speaking because his father spoke Hungarian and very poor German, and his mother spoke German and very poor Hungarian. As a result, he decided that they didn't know what they were talking about.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] Despite being raised in a Jewish family, he later on became an agnostic.[tpl]cite book|title=Memoirs: A Twentieth Century Journey In Science And Politics|year=2002|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7382-0778-0|author=Edward Teller|accessdate=19 April 2012|page=32|quote=Religion was not an issue in my family; indeed, it was never discussed. My only religious training came because the Minta required that all students take classes in their respective religions. My family celebrated one holiday, the Day of Atonement, when we all fasted. Yet my father said prayers for his parents on Saturdays and on all the Jewish holidays. The idea of God that I absorbed was that it would be wonderful if He existed: We needed Him desperately but had not seen Him in many thousands of years.[/tpl] He became very interested in numbers, and would calculate in his head large numbers, such as the number of seconds in a year.Video in which Teller recalls his earliest memories.

He left Hungary in 1926 (partly due to the numerus clausus rule under Horthy's regime). The political climate and revolutions in Hungary during his youth instilled a lingering animosity for both Communism and Fascism in Teller.[ref]
