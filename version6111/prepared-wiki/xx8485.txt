Khas origin represents 40% of the population, Mongoloids and mix represents 50%, who consists of mainly Newar castes and these days any caste marries to each other and forming the third group known as Mixed People of both Khas and Mongoloid Origin. The rest 10% includes recent immigrants from India, Tibet,etc.

==Languages==

Nepal's diverse linguistic heritage evolved from four major language groups: Indo-Aryan, Tibeto-Burman, Mongolian, and various indigenous language isolates. According to the 2001 national census, 92 different living languages are spoken in Nepal (a 93rd category was "unidentified"). The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as mother tongue) are Nepali (43%), Maithili (12%), Tharu (5%), Tamang (4%), Gurung (1.5%), Newari/Nepal Bhasa (3%), Magar (1%), Awadhi (1%), Rai (1%), Limbu (1%) and Bajjika (1%).[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] The remaining 81 languages are each spoken as mother tongue by less than one percent of the population. All the dialects of Nepali are not mutually intelligible. Standard Nepali is spoken by all as the literacy rate is just around 14% comparing to that of 50% before decades. Wide regional variations exist. The dialect of Far Western Region is more similar to Kumaon than Nepali.
Nepali (derived from Khas bhasa) and Maithili are considered to be a member of Indo-European language and is written in Devanagari script. Nepali was the language of the house of Gorkhas in the late 18th century and became the official, national language that serves as the lingua franca among Nepalese of different ethnolinguistic groups. Maithili—along with regional dialects Awadhi and Bhojpuri—is spoken in the southern Terai Region. Hindi and Urdu are widely understood in urban and areas throughout the nation. Many Nepali in government and business uses English as an official language.. English is the language of technical, medical and scientific community as well as the elite bankers, traders and entrepreneurs. There has been a surge in the number and percentage of people who understand English. Majority of the urban and a significant number of the rural schools are English-medium schools. Higher education in technical, medical, scientific and engineering fields are entirely in English.
Other languages, particularly in the Inner Terai, hill and mountain regions are remnants of the country's pre-unification history of dozens of political entities isolated by mountains and gorges.  These languages typically are limited to an area spanning about one day's walk.  Beyond that distance dialects and languages lose mutual intelligibility.

==Religion==

As of the 2011 census, 81.3 of the Nepalese population is Hindu, 9.0% is Buddhist, 4.4% is Muslim, 3.0% is Kirant/Yumaist, 1.4% is Christian, and 0.9% follow other religions or no religion.2011 Nepal Census Report
Religion is important in Nepal; the Kathmandu Valley alone has more than 2,700 religious shrines. The constitution of Nepal describes the country as a "Hindu kingdom", although it does not establish Hinduism as the state religion. Nepal's constitution continues long-standing legal provisions prohibiting discrimination against other religions (but also proselytization). The king was deified as the earthly manifestation of the Hindu god Vishnu. Then on May 19, 2006, the government facing a constitutional crisis, the House of Representatives which had been just reformed, having been previously dissolved, declared Nepal a "secular state".
The 2001 census identified 80.6% of the population as Hindu and 10.7% as Buddhist (although many people labeled Hindu or Buddhist often practice a syncretic blend of Hinduism, Buddhism, or animist traditions). 4.2% of the population is Muslim and 3.6% of the population follows the indigenous Kirant Mundhum religion. Christianity is practiced by less than 0.5% of the population.http://www.cbs.gov.np/Nepal%20in%20figure/nepal%20in%20figures%202006.pdf
Buddhist and Hindu shrines and festivals are respected and celebrated by most Nepalese. Certain animist practices of old indigenous religions survive.

==Ethnic and regional equity==

Pahari Hill Hindus of the Khas Gorkha tribe (Bahun and Chhetri castes) and the Newar ethnicity dominated the civil service, the judiciary and upper ranks of the army throughout the Shah regime (1768–2008). Nepali was the national language and Sanskrit became a required school subject. Children who spoke Nepali natively and who were exposed to Sanskrit had much better chances of passing the national examinations at the end of high school, which meant they had better employment prospects and could continue into higher education. Children who natively spoke local languages of the Terai and Hills, or Tibetan dialects prevailing in the high mountains were at a considerable disadvantage. This history of exclusion coupled with poor prospects for improvement created grievances that encouraged many in ethnic communities such as Madhesi and Tharu in the Terai and Kham Magar in the mid-western hills to support the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and various other armed Maoist opposition groups such as the JTMM during and after the Nepalese Civil War. The negotiated end to this war forced King Gyanendra to abdicate in 2008. Issues of ethnic and regional equity have tended to dominate the agenda of the new republican government and continue to be divisive.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/B66F206172F49BE4C12572D50030C3F0/$file/OCHA+overview+no+12+April+07.pdf |format=PDF |title=OCHA Nepal – Situation Overview |volume=Issue 12 |date=April 2007 |publisher=OCHA |accessdate=2011-05-07[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/2E89F2121C2C57A24925733F000F4F21-Full_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=OCHA Nepal – Situation Overview |volume=Issue 16 |date=July–August 2007 |publisher=OCHA |accessdate=2011-05-07[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/5CC0BE0C971587F2C1257496004A9B9E/$file/ocha+sitrep+12+july08.pdf |format=PDF |title=OCHA Nepal – Situation Overview |volume=Issue 30 |date=June–July 2008 |publisher=OCHA |accessdate=2011-05-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Body+of+murder+victim+found+in+Gulmi&NewsID=266104 |title=Body of murder victim found in Gulmi |publisher=The Himalayan Times online |location=Gulmi |first=Hari |last=Sharma |date=2010-11-18 |accessdate=2011-05-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Hatlebakk |first=Magnus |year=2007 |title=Economic and social structures that may explain the recent conflicts in the Terai of Nepal |location=Kathmandu |publisher=Norwegian Embassy |url=http://www.norway.org.np/NR/rdonlyres/0993F5660B3548A98F819167B4FD596C/72944/http___wwwcmi.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-08[/tpl]

==Nepalese in the U.K.==

According to latest figure from  Office for National Statistics estimates that 35,000 Nepal born people are currently resident in the UK .[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-222711 | title=Population by Country of birth and nationality Jan10-Dec10 | publisher=Office for National Statistics | date=September 2011 | accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl]

==Nepalese in Hong Kong==

Nepalese people in Hong Kong are mainly the children of ex-Gurkhas born in Hong Kong during their parents' service with the British Army's Brigade of Gurkhas, which was based in Hong Kong from the 1970s until the handover. Large groups can be found in Shek Kong, Yuen Long District,  of the main bases of the British army. Many ex-Gurkhas remained in Hong Kong after the end of their service under the sponsorship of their Hong Kong-born children, who held right of abode.
Nepalese of middle age or older generations in Hong Kong are predominantly found in security, while those of younger generations are predominantly found in the business industry.

==Nepalese overseas==

Nepalese migrants abroad have suffered tremendous hardships, including some 7,500 deaths in the Middle East and Malaysia alone since the year 2000, some 3,500 in Saudi Arabia.http://www.ekantipur.com/2014/01/07/top-story/natural-deaths-raise-doubts/383506.html
