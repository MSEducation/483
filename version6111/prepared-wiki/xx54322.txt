==History==

The two albums released by Cacophony—Speed Metal Symphony (1987) and Go Off! (1988)—were showpieces of the kind of highly technical playing typical of the 1980s shred era, with songs featuring fast tempos, melodic solos, exotic neo-classical scales and dual guitar harmonizations. Several of the tracks were entirely instrumental, which prominently demonstrated Friedman and Becker's renowned technical skills.Hinds, Andy. "Speed Metal Symphony". Allmusic. Rovi Corporation. Retrieved 2012-01-02. A 2009 article of Guitar World ranked Speed Metal Symphony as ninth in a list of all-time top ten shred albums.Guitar World Staff (2009-07-09).

Both Friedman and Becker would release their own solo albums—Dragon's Kiss and Perpetual Burn, respectively—in 1988, shortly after which Cacophony ceased to exist. Friedman would later join thrash metal band Megadeth in 1990, remaining with them for nine years as well as releasing several more solo albums, whilst Becker enjoyed a short stint in David Lee Roth's solo band from 1989 to 1991. However, Becker's time with Roth was abruptly cut short due to an onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative disease which rendered him completely unable to play (and, soon afterwards, move or speak) from 1991 onwards.
