Zymotic diseases (from the Greek word ζυμοῦν zumoun "to ferment"), a 19th-century medical term for acute infectious diseases,[tpl]cite book|title=Hospitalism and Zymotic Disease|author=Kennedy, Evor|year=1869|edition=2nd|location=London|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N2Gp-S-xgKAC[/tpl] especially "chief fevers and contagious diseases (e.g. typhus and typhoid fevers, smallpox, scarlet fever, measles, erysipelas, cholera, whooping-cough, diphtheria, &c.)."[tpl]Cite EB1911|wstitle=Zymotic Diseases[/tpl]
Zyme or microzyme was the name of the organism presumed to be the cause of the disease.
 As originally employed by Dr W. Farr, of the British Registrar-General's department, the term included the diseases which were "epidemic, endemic and contagious," and were regarded as owing their origin to the presence of a morbific principle in the system, acting in a manner analogous to, although not identical with, the process of fermentation. 
In the late 19th century, Antoine Béchamp proposed that tiny organisms he termed "microzymas," and not cells, are the fundamental building block of life. Bechamp claimed these microzymas are present in all things—animal, vegetable, and mineral—whether living or dead [tpl]when|date=April 2013[/tpl]. Microzymas are what coalesce to form blood clots and bacteria. Depending upon the condition of the host, microzymas assume various forms. In a diseased body, the microzymas become pathological bacteria and viruses. In a healthy body, microzymas form healthy cells. When a plant or animal dies, the microzymas live on.[tpl]clarify|date=April 2013[/tpl]  His ideas did not gain acceptance.[tpl]cite book|last=Hess|first=David J.|title=Can bacteria cause cancer?: alternative medicine confronts big science|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KojMTlCdYCUC&pg=PA76|year=1997|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=0-8147-3561-4|pages=76–77[/tpl]
It was in British official use from 1839.[tpl]cite book|author=Marjorie Cruickshank|title=Children and Industry: Child Health and Welfare in the North-west Textile Towns During the Nineteenth Century|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iny7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA67|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=1 January 1981|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-0809-2|page=67[/tpl] This term was used extensively in the English Bills of Mortality as a cause of death from 1842. Robert Newstead used this term in a 1908 publication in the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, to describe the contribution of house flies (Musca domestica) towards the spread of infectious diseases. However, by the early-1900s, bacteriology "displaced the old fermentation theory," and so the term became obsolete.
