Florida's Turnpike, designated as the Ronald Reagan Turnpike, and originally known as the Sunshine State Parkway, is a north–south toll road that runs [tpl]convert|312.522|mi|km[/tpl] through 11 counties in the Florida peninsula, from U.S. Route 1 in Florida City, running through Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach where it parallels Interstate 95, and Orlando where it crosses Interstate 4, to its northern terminus at Interstate 75 near Wildwood.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.floridasturnpike.com/about_system.cfm |title=System Description |publisher= Florida Department of Transportation | accessdate=August 11, 2009[/tpl]
The Turnpike itself is in two sections. The first is the Mainline, a [tpl]convert|265|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] route from the Golden Glades Interchange (north of Miami) to Wildwood that carries the hidden designation of State Road 91 (SR 91), opened in stages between 1957 and 1964. The second is the [tpl]convert|48|mi|km|adj=mid|-long[/tpl] Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike (HEFT) completed in 1974, that carries the hidden designation of State Road 821 (SR 821) from Florida City (near Homestead) through the suburbs to the west and north of Miami, connecting to the Mainline four miles (6 km) north of the Golden Glades Interchange. Florida's Turnpike is considered one of the busiest highways in the country (according to the IBBTA, the highway is the nation's 3rd most heavily traveled toll road[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ibtta.org/News/roundupDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=3050|title= International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association|accessdate=November 8, 2009|date=October 3, 2007|publisher=IBTTA[/tpl]).

==Route description==

===Miami to Ft. Pierce===

The main section of Florida's Turnpike begins at the northern end of the Golden Glades Interchange in Miami Gardens as a six-lane highway, and passes through the Golden Glades Toll Barrier, a cashless toll point, similar to the ones on the HEFT. About [tpl]convert|2|mi[/tpl] north of the toll gantry, it passes by Sun Life Stadium to the west before intersecting with the northern end of the HEFT at the Dade/Broward County line [tpl]convert|4|mi[/tpl] from Golden Glades, continuing the HEFT's mile marker. The highway goes through the inland suburbs of Miramar, Hollywood, and Davie, with an exit at Hollywood Boulevard (SR 820) at mile 50, and passing west of the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Hollywood just south the Griffin Road (SR 818) interchange (exit 53). In Davie, about [tpl]convert|8|mi[/tpl] north of the Homestead Extension interchange, it intersects with I-595, providing direct access to Alligator Alley and Ft. Lauderdale International Airport. After two more interchanges, one with Sunrise Boulevard (SR 838) in Plantation and Commercial Boulevard (SR 870) in Tamarac, it crosses the Cypress Creek Toll Plaza in North Lauderdale, the second on the mainline. Just [tpl]convert|1|mi[/tpl] north of the toll plaza, it intersects with the Pompano Beach Service Plaza, the first of seven full service plazas on the mainline, and where the Turnpike's Operations center is located. Still in Pompano Beach, it has a northbound only exit with Atlantic Boulevard (SR 814), followed by full interchanges with Coconut Creek Parkway/Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard (County Road 912) (exit 67) and Sample Road (SR 834) (exit 69). It then enters Deerfield Beach with an interchange with the Sawgrass Expressway in Coconut Creek (exit 71), the final interchange in Broward County. The Turnpike then enters Palm Beach County, with an interchange in each Boca Raton (Glades Road, exit 75), Delray Beach (Atlantic Avenue, exit 81) and Boynton Beach (Boynton Beach Boulevard, exit 86).[tpl]google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Florida's+Turnpike%2FRonald+Reagan+Turnpike&daddr=I-75+N&hl=en&geocode=FSqriwEdaBM4-w%3BFYFmuAEdDmYb-w&mra=ls&sll=25.934273,-80.214974&sspn=0.00232,0.003449&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=7 |title=overview map of Florida's Turnpike from Golden Glades Spur |accessdate=April 16, 2010[/tpl][tpl]google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=NE+1st+Ave&daddr=I-75+N&hl=en&geocode=FYhXhAEdaAw0-w%3BFYFmuAEdDmYb-w&mra=ls&sll=25.965607,-80.255985&sspn=0.074234,0.110378&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=7 |title=overview map of Florida's Turnpike and Homestead Extension |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |link= no[/tpl][tpl]cite map |url=http://www.floridasturnpike.com/maps/UpdatedMaps2013/Mainline.pdf |title=Florida's Turnpike System Mainline Map |publisher= Florida Department of Transportation | accessdate=January 7, 2014[/tpl]
In central Palm Beach County at mile marker 88, the Ticket system of the turnpike begins at the Lantana Toll Plaza. The turnpike narrows to a four-lane highway as it goes through a less developed portion of Palm Beach County, crossing with interchanges with Lake Worth Road, followed by the Lake Worth/West Palm Beach Service Plaza at mile marker 94. In West Palm Beach, the highway has interchanges with US 98/SR 80 (Southern Boulevard), a SunPass only interchange at Jog Road, followed by an interchange at Okeechobee Boulevard (exit 99) that heads directly into downtown West Palm Beach. North of the interchange, the highway enters stretch of sparse development between this point and Port St. Lucie, intersecting with the Beeline Highway, another SunPass only interchange before leaving West Palm Beach. Just north of the SR 786 interchange in Palm Beach Gardens (exit 109), I-95 parallels the Turnpike to the east for about [tpl]convert|20|mi[/tpl] with I-95 visible from the turnpike as it has an interchange with SR 706 (exit 116) in Jupiter and into Martin County. It breaks off as it crosses the Thomas B. Manuel Bridge over the St. Lucie Canal,[tpl]cite news |title= Traffic |work= The Palm Beach Post |date= June 24, 2003 |page= 2B[/tpl] crossing I-95 without an interchange just south of the SR 714 interchange, the only exit in Martin County. I-95 heads west towards the western fringes of St. Lucie County development, while the turnpike takes a path along the central areas of the county. The Turnpike has two interchanges in Port St. Lucie, one at Becker Road (exit 138), the third SunPass only exit, and SR 716 (exit 142), followed by the Port St. Lucie-Fort Pierce service plaza at mile marker 144. The turnpike intersects I-95 one last time just south of SR 70 (exit 152) in Fort Pierce, as I-95 continues to head up the east coast of Florida and the turnpike curves inland towards Orlando.

===Ft. Pierce to Wildwood===

North of the SR 70 interchange, the Turnpike enters a rural area, with cattle farms and orange groves lining the road for most of the section between Fort Pierce and Kissimmee, with only one interchange with SR 60 in Yeehaw Junction (exit 193), although there are two service plazas in this area, one at Fort Drum at mile marker 184 and the other, Canoe Creek, at mile marker 229. Between Fort Pierce and Yeehaw Junction, the turnpike travels in a nearly east-west direction heading inland, with a [tpl]convert|40.5|mi|km[/tpl] gap between the two exits, the second longest of any US expressway.[tpl]cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2011/08/longest-distances-between-exits-on-US-freeways-415029/1?csp=34money&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+UsatodaycomMoney-TopStories+(Money+-+Top+&AID=4992781&PID=4166869&SID=1rk6korfhh52q#.T_0HW459nzI |title=Top 16 longest gaps between Interstate exits |date=August 15, 2011 |work= USA Today |accessdate=July 11, 2012[/tpl] Between Yeehaw Junction and Kissimmee, the turnpike, returning to a north-northwest direction towards Orlando, has a [tpl]convert|48.9|mi|km[/tpl] ([tpl]convert|47|mi|km[/tpl] southbound) stretch without an exit, the longest of any US expressway. At mile marker 236, the ticket system ends at the Three Lakes toll plaza, as the turnpike enters the Orlando Area and development starts to reappear on the turnpike. The SunPass only interchange located at Kissimmee Park Road, a partial interchange featuring a northbound on- and southbound off-ramp only, is named for Senator N. Ray Carroll, longtime Osceola County banker, citrus grower and cattle rancher.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=2006s2240.tr.doc&DocumentType=Analysis&BillNumber=2240&Session=2006 |title= SB 2240 |author= Florida Senate |year= 2006 |accessdate= May 5, 2010[/tpl] After interchanges with US 192/US 441 (exit 242 northbound, exit 244 southbound) and the Osceola Parkway (exit 249), it enters Orange County, and Orlando. Exit 254 is a massive interchange with both Orange Blossom Trail and the Beachline Expressway, where the Turnpike expands to eight lanes north of the interchange, and then it intersects with Consulate Drive (exit 255), a southbound only, SunPass only interchange.
thumb|right|300px|Florida's Turnpike southbound at the interchange with State Road 429 in Ocoee, Exit 267AAfter passing the I-4 interchange (exit 259) near many of Orlando's theme parks, the Turnpike moves in a northwest direction first passing by the Turkey Lake Service Plaza at mile marker 263, where the FDOT district headquarters of the Turnpike are located. The Turnpike has the next two interchanges with Orlando area tollways, the East-West Expressway (exit 265) and the Western Expressway (exit 267A), where in between the two exits, the turnpike expands to become a 12 lane highway, and reverting to an eight-lane highway north of the SR 429 interchange.  The last two Orange County interchanges are with SR 50 five miles apart at exit 267B and 272, with the turnpike becoming a four-lane highway north of exit 272, and staying that way for the rest of its northward journey.  The Turnpike then enters Lake County, heading in a northwestern direction, where hilly countryside become a part of the terrain for the remainder of the expressway. At mile 285, it has a northbound exit/southbound entrance with US 27, followed by the Leesburg toll plaza at mile 288, and a southbound exit/northbound entrance with US 27 at mile 289. The last interchange in Lake County is with County Road 470 (exit 296), which does not provide cash.
At mile marker 299, the turnpike passes through the final service plaza, the Okahumpka service plaza. Between US 301 (exit 304) and the northern terminus (mile 309) is considered to be a free movement as there is no toll for anyone traveling within this section. The tollway ends with an interchange with I-75 in Wildwood, about 20 miles south of Ocala.

==Tolls==

Tolls on the turnpike are an average of 6.7 cents per mile for cars and other two-axle vehicles using SunPass.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.floridasturnpike.com/about_faqs.cfm#6 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher= Florida Department of Transportation | accessdate=January 7, 2014[/tpl] A trip on the entire turnpike (not including the Homestead Extension) would cost $20.93 with cash/Toll-by-Plate, and $16.69 with SunPass.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.floridasturnpike.com/TollCalcV3/index.htm |title=Florida Turnpike Toll Calculator v3.1 |publisher= Florida Department of Transportation | accessdate=January 7, 2014[/tpl] The ticket system is operated between the Lantana and Three Lakes Barrier tolls and on a coin system south of Lantana and north of Kissimmee, with the Golden Glades toll barrier being a cashless toll gantry, similar to the HEFT. The turnpike was originally entirely on the ticket system, but due to congestion in the Miami and Orlando metro areas, a coin system was implemented in those sections of the turnpike in the 1990s.[tpl]cite news |last= Brockman |first= Belinda |title= New Turnpike Toll Booths Open Sunday |work= Palm Beach Post |date= August 17, 1990 |page= 1B[/tpl] The SunPass electronic toll collection system, in use since 1999, has become the primary method of paying tolls on the turnpike, with 80% of customers using the electronic tolling as of October 2009.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.mpotransit.org/newsroom/Trib%201-29-07%20Focus%20Group%20Results.pdf |title= SunPass Sales Show Tolls Are Ticket To Travel |work= Tampa Tribune |date= January 27, 2007 |accessdate= August 11, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last= Turnbell |first= Michael |url= http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/florida/sfl-turnpike-sunpass-102609,0,157792.story  |title= Florida's Turnpike to go cashless as it switches to electronic tolling |work= South Florida Sun-Sentinel |date= October 26, 2009 |accessdate= November 28, 2009[/tpl] SunPass can be used on most Florida toll roads, and with conjunction with other electronic toll collection systems in Florida (E-Pass and LeeWay).

==Services==

===Service plazas===

Eight service plazas are located along the Turnpike, spaced about [tpl]convert|45|mi|km[/tpl] apart. All eight plazas are open 24 hours a day and located on the center median of the turnpike for access from both directions and offer gasoline, diesel fuel, internet access, travel and tourism info and tickets, picnic areas, TV news, gift shops offering Florida Lottery, family-friendly restrooms, and public phones. A convenience store/gas station is located at the Snapper Creek plaza on the Homestead Extension of the Turnpike, while the remaining seven are full-service plazas, featuring a selection of franchised fast food restaurants. Three of the service plazas (Pompano, Port St. Lucie/Fort Pierce, Turkey Lake) also provide E85 ethanol.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.floridasturnpike.com/tools_serviceplazas.cfm |title=Service Plazas |publisher=Florida's Turnpike Enterprise | accessdate=July 31, 2009[/tpl]

===Intelligent transportation systems===

Florida's Turnpike Enterprise is operating with an intelligent transportation systems (ITS), used to detect and manage incidents on the Enterprise's roadways. The ITS are managed by two traffic management centers (TMC), one located in Pompano Beach, and the other located in Ocoee, operated by Florida's Turnpike Enterprise 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The system, consisting of closed-circuit television (CCTV) traffic cameras, dynamic message signs (DMS), highway advisory radio (HAR), and radar vehicle detection system (RVDS), allow the TMC to see anything from congestion to crashes, to disabled vehicles that may pose a threat to the Turnpike's motorists. When necessary, the TMC will activate the dynamic message signs (DMS) and highway advisory radio stations (HAR) to alert motorists of the potential situation, as well as AMBER/Silver Alerts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.floridasturnpike.com/tools_traffic.cfm |title=Traffic Management Center |publisher= Florida Department of Transportation | accessdate=August 11, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.floridasturnpike.com/tools_signs.cfm |title=Dynamic Message Signs |publisher= Florida Department of Transportation | accessdate=August 11, 2009[/tpl]

===Road Rangers===

The Safety Patrol (also known as Road Rangers, and currently sponsored by State Farm) offers free roadside assistance on Florida's Turnpike mainline and Homestead Extension. Utility trucks patrol one of 12 designated zones looking for stranded motorists to provide services such as fuel, tire changes, use of a cellular phone; and also watching out for crashes and road debris. The Traffic Management Center dispatches them to accidents, debris removal, disabled vehicles, or anything that may potentially affect the traveling public; they also assist the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) with traffic maintenance with incidents involving blockage of lanes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.floridasturnpike.com/tools_safetypatrol.cfm |title=State Farm Safety Patrol |publisher= Florida Department of Transportation | accessdate=August 11, 2009[/tpl]

Motorist-aid call boxes are located on both outside shoulders of the road every mile (1.6 km), and send a signal indicating the need for gasoline, repair (tire or engine), or emergency services (police, ambulance, or firefighters).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.floridasturnpike.com/tools_callboxes.cfm |title=Motorist Call Boxes |publisher= Florida Department of Transportation | accessdate=August 11, 2009[/tpl]

==History==

===Planning===

In the years following World War II, Florida was experiencing unprecedented growth in population and tourism, along with a revitalized citrus industry recovering from a harsh freeze early in the decade; the increased traffic load quickly burdened the state's highway system. South Florida businessman and accountant firm owner Charles B. Costar was concerned that a trip down the east coast of Florida would take days on the available road network, passing through every small beachside town, siphoning off the traffic before visitors reached South Florida. After driving on the Pennsylvania Turnpike during a vacation there, he envisioned a similar high-speed turnpike in Florida. In 1953, Costar led a lobby group that resulted in state legislature creating the "Florida Turnpike Act," which Governor Dan McCarty signed into law on July 11, 1953, as well as the Florida State Turnpike Authority, which had the ability to plan, design, and construct bond-financed toll roads, in which Costar was instrumental to create, to be repaid through the collection of tolls from Turnpike customers.
Thomas B. Manuel, known as the "Father of the Turnpike," served as chairman of the Florida State Turnpike Authority from January 1955 to January 1961. Manuel debated with state legislature members opposed to tollways, emphasizing the need for a good highway system in a tourism-driven state. During the 1955 legislative session, many small-county legislators and others opposed to the Parkway, formed a "kill the 'Pike'" coalition; Manuel won over the legislators at his headquarters in the Floridan Hotel near the capitol. Only four votes against the turnpike were entered at the end of the session's roll call, and the Legislature granted permission to build with a $70 million bond issue in June 1955. A Turnpike bridge in Stuart bears his name to honor his contributions.

===Construction===

Construction on the Parkway began on July 4, 1955, starting at what is now the Golden Glades Interchange.[tpl]cite news |title=Collins Signals Go On Miami Turnpike |first= |last= |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ndYzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_eoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3395%2C998571 |newspaper=The Miami News |date=July 5, 1955 |accessdate=July 17, 2012[/tpl] In October 1956, all work on the Sunshine State Parkway north of Ft. Pierce was abandoned and plans for a state-long turnpike were shelved due to passage of the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act, which provided for construction of limited-access highways in the corridors that had been under study for the Parkway Extension. One was Interstate 95, which was slated to connect Jacksonville with Miami in a similar alignment to the planned Sunshine State Parkway Coastal Route. This resulted in completion of a truncated [tpl]convert|110|mi|km[/tpl] highway that ran from Miami to Fort Pierce, opening on January 25, 1957.
In January 1959, Governor LeRoy Collins, favoring a Parkway extension from Fort Pierce to Orlando, stated that building the Parkway north of Orlando would be unnecessary due to the interstate highway system. In late May 1959, the Board authorized a study for the Parkway Extension to Orlando, and connecting the Interstate routes in Florida. In 1961, Governor Collins approved the sale of $80 million in bonds to finance the parkway extension from Fort Pierce to Wildwood, adding another [tpl]convert|156|mi|km[/tpl] of roadway and shifting Interstate 75's route six miles (10 km) eastward from its original alignment. The extension was opened in three stages; a [tpl]convert|61|mi[/tpl] section between Yeehaw Junction and Orlando opened on July 17, 1963, a section linking Fort Pierce and Yeehaw Junction opened on November 22, 1963, and the section between Orlando and the northern terminus of I-75 opened on July 24, 1964, completing the mainline.

====I-95 realignment====

The Bureau of Public Roads approved an Interstate 95 alignment that used [tpl]convert|41|mi|km[/tpl] of the Turnpike from PGA Boulevard (SR 786) in Palm Beach Gardens north to SR 70 in Ft. Pierce in the 1950s.[tpl]cite news |title= Squabbles unnecessary |work= Boca Raton News |date= May 10, 1973 |page= 4A[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Free Roads Vs.

===Reckless spending===

With the St. Petersburg Times in 1963, a team led by Martin Waldron wrote a total of 150,000 words as part of the newspaper's coverage of unchecked spending by the Florida Turnpike Authority that led to estimated costs quadrupling from initial estimates of $100 million.[tpl]cite news |author= Staff |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/28/obituaries/martin-o-waldron-is-dead-at-56-reporting-led-to-a-pulitzer-prize.html |title= Martin O.

===System expansion===

With Florida still growing in population in the 1960s, preliminary studies began for expanding portions of the Turnpike to six lanes in South Florida and additional north–south highways in that area. Dade County and the State Road Department developed a plan for the West Dade Expressway (now known as the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike), beginning at the Turnpike near the Dade County/Broward County line, turning westward and southward, terminating at Florida City in southern Dade County. In 1967, the Florida State Turnpike Authority was authorized to perform engineering and feasibility studies on the West Dade Expressway, and the Bee Line Connector extension, now known as the Martin Andersen Beachline Expressway. The results of the studies came in December 1968, but due to an uncertain bond market and an unknown future for the toll authority, decisions on the roads were delayed.
The Florida Department of Transportation was created in July 1969, with the Florida State Turnpike Authority becoming a part of the new FDOT. Soon after, FDOT and Orange and Dade County officials agreed the Bee Line Connector and Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike would be financed by revenue bond issues as extensions of Florida's Turnpike. The Beeline Expressway opened in 1973 and the Homestead Extension opened in 1974 as a part of the Turnpike mainline.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.floridasturnpike.com/downloads/50thBookFinal.pdf |title=Florida's Turnpike 50 Year Celebration |year=2007 |format=PDF |publisher= Florida Department of Transportation | accessdate=July 31, 2009[/tpl]

===Later changes===

From its opening in January 1957 to April 12, 1968, the road was known as the Sunshine State Parkway (SSP). On April 12, 1968, the road was renamed to its current name of Florida's Turnpike, to identify that the toll road was located in Florida and to avoid confusion from other Florida landmarks such as the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.[tpl]cite news |title= Parkway Name Changed to Protect Its Identity |work= St. Petersburg Times |date= April 13, 1968[/tpl] The Sunshine State Parkway moniker was commonly used for the next decade and remnants of the name can be seen on several Turnpike maintenance buildings.[tpl]cite news |title= Help Speed I-95 |work= Palm Beach Post |date= August 29, 1978[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last= Mitgang |first= Lee |title= States are eyeing higher speed limits |work= The Free Lance-Star |date= March 6, 1981[/tpl]
On September 1, 1971, the Turnpike switched from a sequential exit numbering system to a hybrid numbering system, where adjacent exit numbers differed by 4 south of SR 60 (exit 60 at the time) and 5 north of SR 60.[tpl]cite news |last= Williams |first= Verve |title= Turnpike in numbers game by changing the exits |work= The Miami News |date= September 13, 1971 |page= 1A[/tpl]
Between 1974 and 1986, the turnpike experienced little change other than maintenance as the original bonds on the road were being paid off. During this period, the turnpike experienced the first of five toll hikes on February 15, 1979, when the cost of a trip from Golden Glades to Wildwood increased to $5.90 from $4.80, the road's original toll.[tpl]cite news |title= Hike In Toll Could Backfire On DOT |work= Ocala Star-Banner |date= February 14, 1979 |page= 4A[/tpl]
In 1988, the Office of Florida's Turnpike was formed, with $220 million worth of revenue bonds being sold in April 1989 to renovate the toll plazas, service centers and improve the road with the reduction of urban congestion. Fifteen new interchanges were planned in the early 1990s with four of them opened by July 1991. Also during this time, sections of the turnpike were converted from a ticket system to a coin system due to urban congestion, with several mainline toll plazas being built. The section between the Golden Glades Plaza and Lantana was converted in 1990, with the opening of the Cypress Creek and Lantana Toll Plazas. Coin baskets were installed in 1994 after years of delays.[tpl]cite news |last= Crowley |first= Brian E. |title= Approval Expected for Turnpike Plans |work= The Palm Beach Post |date= July 27, 1985 |page= 1A[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last1= Pierce |first1= Rick |last2= Ellis |first2= Elaine A. |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Turnpike fares well under coin system traffic flow smooth on workday debut |work= Sun-Sentinel |date= August 21, 1990 |page= 8B[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last1= Pierce |first1= Rick |last2= Chabot |first2= Lucy |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Turnpike Coin Baskets Delayed Until February |work= Sun-Sentinel |date= August 17, 1993 |page= 1A[/tpl] The portion north of Kissimmee was converted in on August 20, 1995, with the addition of the Three Lakes Toll Plaza and the Wildwood toll plaza at mile 304 being replaced by the Leesburg toll barrier on July 7, 1995.[tpl]cite news |title= Turnpike converts to coin system |work= Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date= August 19, 1995 |page= 6B[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last= Coole |first= Terri |title= Turnpike Exchange: Coins, not tickets a new toll plaza south of Leesburg, when complete, will mean a pay-as-you-go system on the highway's northern section |work= Orlando Sentinel |date= February 12, 1993 |page= 1[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Toll Plaza at Wildwood shuts down |work= Orlando Sentinel |date= July 7, 1995 |page= 2[/tpl]
The improvements also came with a series of toll hikes between 1989 and 1993 to make the toll rates more uniform six cents per mile throughout the turnpike's length. The first one was enacted on April 1, 1989, which raised the rate to $9.95.[tpl]cite news |title= Turnpike tolls nearly double |work= Gainesville Sun |date= March 31, 1989 |page= 1A[/tpl] The second one, on July 1, 1991, affected only the section north of Lantana, raising the trip's cost to $12.35.[tpl]cite news |last= Douthat |first= Bill |title= Turnpike Tolls To Jump 30% |work= The Palm Beach Post |date= May 31, 1991 |page= 1A[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last= O'Neal |first= Donna |title= Laws raise fees, boost protection |work= Lakeland Ledger |date= July 1, 1991 |page= 3B[/tpl] The last one took effect on July 11, 1993, increasing the trip's cost to $14.40.[tpl]cite news |title= Florida Turnpike tolls to increase today |work= Ocala Star-Banner |date= July 11, 1993 |page= 4B[/tpl]

In April 1999, SunPass was introduced to the public, with SunPass only interchanges and lanes being introduced throughout the 2000s. The latest toll hike took effect on March 7, 2004, increasing the toll rate for non SunPass users to $18.20, with SunPass users still using the 1993 toll rates.[tpl]cite news |last= McGinness |first= Chuck |title= Plan To Hike Toll On Turnpike Rapped |work= The Palm Beach Post |date= January 8, 2004 |page= 7B[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last= Turnbell |first= Michael |title= Drivers Dash To Get SunPass Before Toll Increases Kick In |work= Sun-Sentinel |date= March 6, 2004 |page= 1B[/tpl]
The HEFT ceased cash toll collections on February 19, 2011, becoming an exclusive electronic toll road, a move announced in November 2009. The manned toll plazas were converted into electronic toll gantries, and the only ways to pay are either by SunPass transponders or a "toll-by-plate" program.[tpl]cite news |first= Michael |last= Turnbell |work= Sun-Sentinel |date= February 14, 2011 |url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2011-02-14/news/fl-turnpike-toll-by-plate-20110214_1_debit-card-or-cash-cash-collection-open-road-tolling |title= Turnpike to stop taking cash on Homestead Extension Feb. 19[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.tampabay.com/incoming/tolls-go-electronic-on-47-mile-stretch-of-florida-turnpike/1052806 |title= Tolls go electronic on 47-mile stretch of Florida Turnpike |work= St. Petersburg Times |date= November 19, 2009 |accessdate= November 28, 2009[/tpl]  The Turnpike mainline began its conversion to a cashless toll road with the Golden Glades toll barrier being converted into a toll gantry on January 25th, 2014, and no longer accepts cash.[tpl]cite news| last= Turnbell| first= Michael| date= 3 August 2013| title= Sawgrass Expressway going cashless in 2014| url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-08-03/news/fl-sawgrass-goes-cashless-20130803_1_toll-plazas-sawgrass-expressway-toll-collection| newspaper= South Florida Sun Sentinel| accessdate= 6 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news| last= Turnbell| first= Michael| date= 12 January 2014| title= Golden Glades going cashless on Jan. 25| url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2014-01-12/news/fl-turnpike-electronic-tolling-20140112_1_golden-glades-homestead-extension-all-electronic-tolling| newspaper= South Florida Sun Sentinel| accessdate= 15 January 2014[/tpl]
Between 2005 and 2012, the Turnpike spent $380 million doubling the amount of lanes from SR 528 to the northernmost interchange with SR 50 west of Winter Garden (exit 272).  Most of the section was expanded from four to eight lanes, with the section between SR 408 and SR 429 being expanded from six to 12 lanes.  The portion between SR 528 and Interstate 4 opened in 2008, with the portion between I-4 and SR 408 being finished in 2010, SR 408 to Beulah Road (at the north end of the SR 429 interchange) opened in March 2011, and the portion between Beulah Road and SR 50 (exit 272) was completed in 2012.[tpl]cite report |title= Florida’s Turnpike Enterprise Tentative Five-Year Work Program Overview 2012 |publisher= Florida Department of Transportation[/tpl]
In 2007, legislation was passed in Florida to index toll rates across the state to the national Consumer price index (CPI), to be enacted by the end of June, 2012. As a result, the toll rates on roads on Florida's Turnpike Enterprise were raised on June 24, 2012, an increase of 11.7% to reflect the previous five years.  The legislation allows for SunPass rates to be raised slightly each year, with cash rates going up every five years, with SunPass rates staying about a quarter cheaper than cash rates.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.floridasturnpike.com/tools_tollrateslisting.cfm |title=Traveler Information | Toll Rates |publisher=Florida Department of Transportation |accessdate=September 18, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news| last= Turnbell| first= Michael| date= 7 June 2012| title= Tolls on Turnpike, Sawgrass, Alligator Alley going up on June 24| url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-06-07/news/fl-turnpike-toll-increase-20120607_1_higher-tolls-toll-roads-sunpass-customers| newspaper= South Florida Sun Sentinel| accessdate= 6 January 2014[/tpl]  In keeping with the legislation, SunPass and toll-by-plate rates were raised again on July 1, 2013 by 2.1%, with cash toll rates staying the same, and are the toll rates as of January 2014.[tpl]cite news| last= Turnbell| first= Michael| date= 28 June 2013| title= Tolls go up July 1 on turnpike, state toll roads| url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-06-28/news/fl-tolls-hike-tophat-20130628_1_toll-july-1-sunpass| newspaper= South Florida Sun Sentinel| accessdate= 7 January 2014[/tpl]

A study is currently under way to eventually reconstruct the northern end of the Turnpike at its junction with Interstate 75 to improve the traffic merge pattern between I-75 and State Road 44, with congestion and some drivers suddenly changing lanes on I-75 between the Turnpike junction and SR 44 a major issue in the area.[tpl]cite news |last= Clary |first= Susan |title=The road home is a bit stuffed |work= St. Petersburg Times |edition= Tampa |date= November 28, 1994 |page= 1B[/tpl] The project is not scheduled for construction funding until 2015.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dot.state.fl.us/publicinformationoffice/moredot/pdf%20files/TurnPSumpterI75InterchangeModification.pdf |title=I-75/Turnpike Interchange Modification Sumter County |format=PDF |publisher= Florida Department of Transportation | accessdate=August 20, 2009[/tpl]
The Turnpike Enterprise is also studying possible developer-funded future interchanges near mile marker 279 (servicing Minneola and Clermont) and at County Road 468 (mile marker 300, servicing The Villages and Lady Lake). Neither project is funded or scheduled for construction at this time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.floridasturnpike.com/construction_future.cfm |title=Construction: Future Projects |publisher= Florida Department of Transportation | accessdate=March 24, 2010[/tpl]

==Exit list==

North of the HEFT/mainline intersection, the mainline continues the mileage from mile 47 from the HEFT. The spur of the mainline south of the HEFT to the Golden Glades Interchange assumes an alternate numbering system that suffixes an X to each exit number. All tolls described assume the toll is paid in cash.
