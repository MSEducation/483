Stone (first name and dates unknown) was an English cricketer who played in major cricket matches for Kent in 1751.

==Career==

Stone played in two major matches in 1751 for Kent against the All-England Eleven. On 20 and 21 May, he was a member of the Kent team that lost by 9 runs at the Artillery Ground.Ashley-Cooper, p.68.Waghorn, pp.47â€“49.  A return match was arranged at the same venue on 22 May and All-England won by an innings and 9 runs, with Stone again a member of the Kent team.
Stone was also named in two single wicket "fives" matches that were held on 3 and 5 June at the Artillery Ground.  In both games, he played for Kent against Surrey, Kent winning each time.
Stone is only recorded on those four occasions and it is not known if he played regularly in earlier and later seasons. Players were rarely mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other known references to Stone.
