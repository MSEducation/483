The Workshop on Structure and Constituency in Languages of the Americas (WSCLA) is an annual linguistics conference, which started in 1995. The central objective of WSCLA  is to bring together linguists who are engaged in research on the formal study of the Aboriginal languages of the Americas in order to exchange ideas across theories, language families, generations of scholars, and across the academic and non-academic communities who are involved in language maintenance and revitalization.
Papers and posters presented at WSCLA meetings are published by the University of British Columbia Working Papers in Linguistics (UBCWPL).
