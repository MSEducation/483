</ref> In 1982, amateur astronomers counted 90 April Lyrids per hour at the peak and similar rates were seen in 1922. A stronger storm of up to 700 per hour occurred in 1803,<ref name=martinez1994/> observed by a journalist in [[Richmond, Virginia]]:
 
 "Shooting stars. This electrical sic phenomenon was observed on Wednesday morning last at Richmond and its vicinity, in a manner that alarmed many, and astonished every person that beheld it. From one until three in the morning, those starry meteors seemed to fall from every point in the heavens, in such numbers as to resemble a shower of sky rockets ..."

Another such outburst, and the oldest known, the shower on March 23.7,M. Ed.

Jenniskens, 2006, Meteor Showers and their Parent Comets, Cambridge University Press, 790 pp. 687 BC (proleptic Julian calendar) was recorded in Zuo Zhuan, which describes the shower as "On day xīn-mǎo of month 4 in the summer (of year 7 of King Zhuang of Lu), at night, fixed stars are invisible, at midnight, stars dropped down like rain."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/meteors/3305866.html|title=Meteors – April's Lyrid Meteor Shower|last=Sinnott|first=Roger W.|year=2008|publisher=Sky and Telescope|page=1|accessdate=2008-08-05[/tpl] (夏四月辛卯 夜 恆星不見 夜中 星隕如雨)
In the Australian Aboriginal astronomy of the Boorong tribe, the Lyrids represent the scratchings of the Mallee fowl (represented by Vega), coinciding with its nest-building season.[tpl]cite web|last=Hill|first=Tanya|title=The Lyrids meteor shower should put on a show overnight|url=http://theconversation.com/the-lyrids-meteor-shower-should-put-on-a-show-overnight-25746|work=The Conversation|accessdate=22 April 2014|coauthors=Brown, Michael J.

==2012 Bolide==

During the 2012 shower a bolide and sonic boom rattled buildings in California and Nevada around 8AM PDT 22 April 2012. The bolide air burst was likely a random unrelated meteoroid and not a member of the Lyrids shower. The bolide was so bright that witnesses were seeing spots afterward. The event was recorded by two infrasound monitoring stations of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization’s International Monitoring System. The preliminary analysis are indicative of energy yield of approximately 4 kilotons of TNT equivalent. Hiroshima's "Little Boy" had a yield of about 15 kt. The meteoroid was likely between the size of a dish washer and a mini van. The air burst had approximate coordinates of 37.6N, 120.5W. The meteor was picked up by weather radar between Auburn, CA and Placerville, CA. Robert Ward found a small CM chondrite fragment in the Henningsen Lotus Park just west of Coloma, CA on 24 April 2012. The meteorite fall is now known as the Sutter's Mill meteorite. The orbit calculated by Peter Jenniskens shows this meteoroid was not a member of the April Lyrid shower.
A similar event was reported in northern Guatemala around 10:22PM 30 April 2012.
