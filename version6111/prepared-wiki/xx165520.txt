Alexander Yuryevich "Sasha" Pichushkin ([tpl]lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Ю́рьевич Пичу́шкин[/tpl], born 9 April 1974 in Mytishchi, Moscow Oblast), also known as The Chessboard Killer and The Bitsa Park Maniac, is a Russian serial killer. He is believed to have killed at least 49 people, and possibly as many as 60, in southwest Moscow's Bitsa Park, where a number of the victims' bodies were found.

==Early life==

Pichushkin is remembered to have been an initially sociable child. However, this changed following an incident in which Pichushkin fell backwards off a swing and was then struck in the forehead as it swung back. Experts have speculated that this event may have damaged the frontal cortex of Pichushkin's brain; such damage is known to produce poor impulse regulation and a tendency towards aggression. That this event happened when Pichushkin was still a child is also significant, as a child's forehead has been proven to provide only 1/8 the protection for the brain as that of an adult. Indeed, following this accident Pichushkin frequently became hostile and impulsive, and his mother therefore decided to transfer him from a mainstream school to one for children with learning disabilities. As a result of this transfer, children from the mainstream school began to physically and verbally bully Pichushkin (at this time, a common practice in the area against those with learning disabilities), referring to him as "that retard". This abuse only served to intensify Pichushkin's rage and hostility. Upon reaching early adolescence, Pichushkin's maternal grandfather recognized that Pichushkin was highly intelligent, and felt that his innate talents were being wasted, as he wasn't involved in any activities at home, and the school he was enrolled in catered more towards overcoming disability, rather than exceptional achievement.
The grandfather took Pichushkin to live in his home and encouraged him to pursue intellectual pursuits outside of school. The most significant of these interests was chess, with Pichushkin being taught how to play and, after demonstrating his ability, being introduced to the exhibition games played publicly in Bitsa Park. It turned out that Pichushkin was an outstanding chess player, and in these exhibition games against generally elderly men, Pichushkin first found a channel for his aggression by dominating the chessboard in all of his games. Unfortunately, Pichushkin was still bullied by mainstream school children throughout his adolescence and, in perhaps the cruelest emotional blow, toward the end of this period Pichushkin's grandfather died. Pichushkin was left with no choice but to return to his mother's home, at which time he enrolled as a student. It has been reported that the death of his grandfather greatly affected Pichushkin, and, possibly in an effort to dull the pain of the loss and to calm his severe aggressive tendencies, Pichushkin began to consume large quantities of vodka. He continued to play chess both at home and in the exhibition games in Bitsa Park, now joining the other men in drinking vodka, though unlike them the alcohol did not affect his chess abilities. It was at this time that Pichushkin began to develop a more sinister hobby that at the time remained unknown to anyone. Whenever Pichushkin knew he was going to come into contact with children, he would take a video camera along and would proceed to threaten them, on one disturbing, and alarmingly prophetic occasion that has since been made public, holding a young child by one leg, upside-down, and saying to the camera: "You are in my power now... I am going to drop you from the window... and you will fall 15 meters to your death..." He would then watch these videos repeatedly to reaffirm his power.  However, by 1992 this had became insufficient to satisfy his urges.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==Murders==

Pichushkin committed his first known murder as a student in 1992 and stepped up his crimes in 2001.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22416817-663,00.html|title=Russian chess player on trial for 49 alleged murders|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=News.com.au|date=2007-09-14|accessdate=2009-04-10[/tpl] Russian media have speculated that Pichushkin may have been motivated, in part, by a macabre competition with another notorious Russian serial killer, Andrei Chikatilo, the 'Rostov Ripper', who was convicted in 1992 of killing 53 children and young women over a 12 year period.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/10/09/russian.killer.ap/index.html|title='Chessboard killer' revels in death|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071215164721/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/10/09/russian.killer.ap/index.html|archivedate=2007-12-15|agency=Associated Press|publisher=CNN|date=2007-10-09|accessdate=2009-04-10[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Pichushkin has said his aim was to kill 64 people, the number of squares on a chessboard.[tpl]cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20070801/70097233.html|title=Investigators believe 62 murdered by "chessboard killer"|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2007-08-01|accessdate=2009-04-10| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090428061003/http://en.rian.ru/russia/20070801/70097233.html| archivedate= 28 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6926680.stm|title=Russian suspected of 62 murders|publisher=BBC News Online|date=2007-08-01|accessdate=2009-04-10[/tpl] He later recanted this statement, saying that he would have continued killing indefinitely if he had not been stopped.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7059939.stm|title=Russia 'chessboard killer' guilty|publisher=BBC News Online|date=2007-10-24|accessdate=2009-04-10| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090425201504/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7059939.stm| archivedate= 25 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Pichushkin primarily targeted elderly homeless men by luring them with the offer of free vodka. After drinking with them, he would kill them with repeated blows to the head with a hammer. In what became his trademark, or signature, he would then push a vodka bottle into the gaping wound in their skulls. He also targeted younger men, children and women. He would always attack from behind in order to take the victim by surprise and to avoid spilling blood on his clothes.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/channel/blog/video/x3ghxv_serial-killer-in-moscow-killed-52-p_blog?from=rss|title=Serial Killer in Moscow killed 52 people|agency=Russia Today|publisher=Dailymotion|date=2007-11-12|accessdate=2009-04-10[/tpl] He claimed that while killing people he felt like God as he decided whether his victims should live or die. "In all cases I killed for only one reason. I killed in order to live, because when you kill, you want to live," he once said.  "For me, life without murder is like life without food for you. I felt like the father of all these people, since it was I who opened the door for them to another world."[tpl]cite news|first=Howard|last=Chua-Eoan|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1661084,00.html?xid=feed-cnn-topics|title=The Grandmaster of Murder?|work=Time|date=2007-09-12|accessdate=2009-04-10[/tpl] Experts at the Serbsky Institute, Russia's main psychiatric clinic, have found Pichushkin sane, but suffering from antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, making him a psychopath.
According to the documentary, "Serial Killers",http://www.wintv.com.au/mount_gambier/tvshow/item/25764 Pichushkin, once apprehended, led police officers to the scenes of many of his crimes in Bitsa Park, and demonstrated a keen recollection of how the murders were committed. He was filmed reenacting them in great detail, a process which is a regular part of Russian criminal investigation. He also revealed that a number of the murders he committed were not done in his preferred method (hammer blows to the back of the head), but by throwing his victims down into the network of sewers running underneath Bitsa Park (although one of his victims did survive this ordeal).
The murder of Marina Moskalyova, 36, in the spring of 2006, was his last. When her body was found in Bitsa Park, complete with Pichushkin's trademark injuries, a metro ticket found in her possession led to authorities reviewing surveillance tape footage from the Moscow metro system, where she was filmed, just hours before her death, walking on the platform accompanied by Pichushkin.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/serial-killer-on-trial-moscows-grandmaster-of-murder-402313.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Serial killer on trial: Moscow's grandmaster of murder | date=2007-09-14[/tpl]

==Trial and imprisonment==

He was arrested on 16 June 2006, and convicted on 24 October 2007 of 49 murders and 3 attempted murders. He asked a Russian court to add an additional 11 victims to his body count, bringing his claimed death toll to 60, and 3 surviving victims.[tpl]cite news|first=Conor|last=Sweeney|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL0914187920071009?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews&rpc=22&sp=true|title=Russian serial killer says murder is like love|publisher=Reuters|date=2007-10-09|accessdate=2009-04-10[/tpl] During his trial, as with Andrei Chikatilo, Pichushkin was housed in a glass cage for his own protection.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSL247048420071024?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&rpc=22&sp=true|title=Russian 'chessboard killer' convicted of 48 murders|first=Christian|last=Lowe|publisher=Reuters|date=2007-10-24|accessdate=2009-04-10[/tpl] It took Judge Vladimir Usov an hour to read the verdict: life in prison[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inthenews.co.uk/news/autocodes/countries/russia/chessboard-killer-gets-life-$1158010.htm|title='Chessboard killer' gets life|publisher=InTheNews.co.uk|date=2007-10-29|accessdate=2007-10-29[/tpl] with the first 15 years to be spent in solitary confinement.
