The Volkswagen Golf is a compact car produced by the German manufacturer Volkswagen since 1974, marketed worldwide across seven generations, in various body configurations and under various nameplates – as the Volkswagen Rabbit in the United States and Canada (Mk1 and Mk5), and as the Volkswagen Caribe in Mexico (Mk1).
The original Golf Mk1 was a front-wheel drive, front-engined replacement for the air-cooled, rear-engined, rear-wheel drive Volkswagen Beetle. Historically, the Golf is Volkswagen's best-selling model and the world's second best-selling model, with more than 29 million built by 2012.[tpl]cite news |author=Gareth Kent |title=VW Golf build passes 25 million |work=carmagazine.co.uk |date=30 March 2007 |url= http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/News/Search-Results/Industry-News/VW-Golf-build-passes-25-million-/?&R=EPI-3666 |accessdate=11 March 2008[/tpl]
Most production of the Golf was initially in the 3-door hatchback style.Figures for 1974 to 1987: 4.7 million 3-door models, 2.55 million 5-doors, according to: [tpl]cite book|title=Deutsche Autos 1945–1990, vol.3|last=Oswald |first=Werner|year=2001|publisher=Motorbuch Verlag|location= Stuttgart|isbn=3-613-02116-1|pages=86–87[/tpl] Other variants include a 5-door hatchback, estate/wagon (Variant, from 1993), convertible (Cabriolet and Cabrio, 1979–2002, 2011–present), and a Golf-derived notchback saloon/sedan, variously called Volkswagen Jetta, Volkswagen Vento (from 1992) or Volkswagen Bora (from 1999). The cars have filled many market segments, from basic personal cars, to high-performance hot hatches.
The Volkswagen Golf has won many awards throughout its history. The Volkswagen Golf won the World Car of the Year in 2009 with the Volkswagen Golf Mk6 and in 2013 with the Volkswagen Golf Mk7. Every generation of Golf has been a runner-up in the European Car of the Year awards and two have been winners, the Golf Mk3 in 1992 and the Golf Mk7 in 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1992_1/coty |title=Previous Winners |language=[tpl]es icon[/tpl] |publisher=Car of the Year |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09[/tpl] The Volkswagen Golf has made the Car and Driver annual 10Best list multiple times.

==Nameplate etymology==

Despite numerous sources suggesting that the Golf nameplate is derived from the German word for Gulf Stream) or that "Golf" is a sport theme-related name as shared with the Polo and Derby— a 2013 report by former VW advertising copywriter Bertel Schmitt, says that — after consulting knowledgeable VW sources including Dr. Carl Hahn, former Volkswagen of America Chief and WP Schmidt, former sales chief at Volkswagen — no conclusive evidence suggests that Volkswagen employed a naming theme for its then new front-drive, water-cooled vehicles; nor that the names trace etymologically to any particular theme; nor that any naming system "was ever announced, either officially or confidentially."[ref]

==[tpl]Anchor|A1|17[/tpl]First generation (A1, Typ 17; 1974–1983)==

In May 1974,All dates for Mk1 to Mk4 according to: [tpl]cite book|title=Deutsche Autos 1945–1990, vol.3 |last=Oswald |first=Werner |year=2001 |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-02116-1 |pages=72–137[/tpl] and [tpl]cite book |last=Kittler |first=Eberhard |title=Deutsche Autos seit 1990, vol.5 |pages=266–313 |language=German |publisher=Motorbuch Verlag |year=2001 |location=Stuttgart |isbn=3-613-02128-5[/tpl] Volkswagen presented the first-generation Golf as a modern front-wheel-drive, long-range replacement for the Volkswagen Beetle. Later Golf variations included the Golf GTI "hot hatch" (introduced in June 1976), a diesel-powered version (from September 1976), the Jetta notchback saloon version (from October 1979), the Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet AND Golf Cabriolet (from January 1980) and a Golf-based pickup, the Volkswagen Caddy.
The Golf Mk1 was sold as the Volkswagen Rabbit in the United States and Canada and as the Volkswagen Caribe in Mexico.
A facelifted version of the Golf Mk1 was produced in South Africa as the Citi Golf from 1984 to 2009.[tpl]cite web |url=http://topcar.co.za/user-generated/goodbye-citi-golf/ |title=Goodbye Citi Golf | TopCar |work=topcar.co.za |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2014 |author= |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140320062853/http://topcar.co.za/user-generated/goodbye-citi-golf/ |archivedate=19 March 2014 |deadurl=no[/tpl]

==[tpl]Anchor|A2|1G[/tpl]Second generation (A2, Typ 1G; 1983–1992)==

September 1983 saw the introduction of the second-generation Golf Mk2 that grew slightly in terms of wheelbase, exterior and interior dimensions, while retaining, in a more rounded form, the Mk1's overall look. Although it was available on the home market and indeed most other left-hand drive markets by the end of 1983, it was not launched onto the British market until March 1984. The original Golf had been one of the few front-wheel drive hatchbacks sold in Britain and indeed anywhere else on its arrival a decade earlier; by this stage, however, virtually every major manufacturer was producing a Golf-like hatchback.
In 1985, the first Golfs with four-wheel-drive (Golf syncro) went on sale with the same Syncro four-wheel-drive system being employed on the supercharged G60 models, exclusively released on the continent in 1989 with [tpl]convert|160|bhp|kW|disp=flip|abbr=on[/tpl] and ABS braking.
A Mk2-based second generation Jetta was unveiled in January 1984. There was no Mk2-based cabriolet model; instead, the Mk1 Cabriolet was continued over the Mk2's entire production run.

==[tpl]Anchor|A3|1H[/tpl]Third generation (A3, Typ 1H; 1993–2001)==

The third-generation Golf Mk3 made its home-market début in August 1991 and again grew slightly in comparison with its immediate predecessor, while its wheelbase remained unchanged.
New engines included the first Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine in a Golf, and a narrow-angle 2.8 L VR6 engine. The VR6-engined version accelerated from [tpl]convert|0|-|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] in 7.1 seconds, posting a record 15.5¼-mile time at [tpl]convert|90.5|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl] EPA estimate [tpl]convert|26|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on[/tpl] (city) or [tpl]convert|32|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on[/tpl] (highway), with [tpl]convert|261|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] per tank (city) and [tpl]convert|363|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] per tank (highway). For the first time ever, a Golf estate (Golf Variant) joined the line-up in September 1993 (although most markets did not receive this model until early 1994). At the same time, a completely new Mk3-derived Cabriolet was introduced, replacing the 13-year-old Mk1-based version with a body style similar to that of the Mk3 Golf from 1994 to early 1999. The Mk3 Golf Cabrio received a Mk4-style facelift for the late 1999 model and was continued until 2002.
The notchback version, called VW Vento (or Jetta in North America), was presented in January, 1992.
It was European Car of the Year for 1992, ahead of PSA's new ZX model and GM's new Astra model.
The Mk3 continued to be sold until 1999 in the United States, Canada and parts of South America, also in Mexico as a special edition called "Mi" (Golf CL 4-door, added A/C, special interiors, OEM black tinted rear stop lights, and ABS, no OEM radio) ("Mi" ("i" in red) stands for Multipoint Injection and the 1.8 L engine was upgraded to 2.0).

==[tpl]Anchor|A4|1J[/tpl]Fourth generation (A4, Typ 1J; 1997–2004)==

The Golf Mk4 was first introduced in August 1997, followed by a notchback version (VW Bora or, in North America, again VW Jetta) in August 1998 and a new Golf Variant (estate) in March 1999. There was no Mk4-derived Cabriolet, although the Mk3 Cabriolet received a facelift in late 1999 that comprised bumpers, grill and headlights similar to those of the Mark 4 models.
New high-performance models included the 3.2 L VR6-engined four-wheel-drive Golf "R32" introduced in 2002, its predecessor the 2.8 L VR6-engined "Golf V6 4Motion" (succeeding the 2.9 L Mk3 "Golf VR6 Syncro"), as well as use of the famous 1.8T (turbo) 4-cylinder used in various Volkswagen Group models.
As of 2008, certain variants of the Golf/Bora Mk4 were still in production in Brazil, China, and Mexico. Revised versions of the Mk4 were sold in Canada marketed as the Golf City and Jetta City from 2007 to 2010. The two models were VW Canada's entry-level offerings. They received a significant freshening for the 2008 model year, including revised headlamps, taillamps, front and rear fascias, sound systems, and wheels. Both models were offered only with the 2.0 L, 8-valve SOHC four-cylinder gasoline engine, rated at [tpl]convert|115|bhp|kW|disp=flip|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. They were the only entry-level offerings with an optional six-speed automatic. Production of the European variant of the Golf Mk4 ceased at the end of the 2003 model year. Production of the U.S version ended in 2006.
When the Chinese market Bora received a July 2006 facelift, the Golf did too, becoming the "Bora HS" in the process.
The MK4's popularity and low cost has allowed it to remain in production in several countries, including Brazil and Argentina, with minor cosmetic changes.

==[tpl]Anchor|A5|1K[/tpl]Fifth generation (A5, Typ 1K; 2004–2008)==

The Golf Mk5 was introduced in Europe in 2003. In North America, Volkswagen brought back the Rabbit nameplate when it introduced the vehicle in 2006. The North American base model is powered by a 2.5 L five-cylinder engine, which produced [tpl]convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip[/tpl] in 2006 and 2007, but was upped to [tpl]convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip[/tpl] in the later models. A GTI version is powered by a turbocharged version of the 2.0 TFSI engine, producing [tpl]Convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip[/tpl].
Volkswagen also introduced the "Fast" marketing idea for the North American market, "dedicated to the 'fast' that lives inside every driver". Drivers who purchased new GTI Mk5s from a dealership were shipped a model of said Fast, which employs GTI-like features. The GTI version is the only version on sale in Mexico.
The saloon/sedan version, again called Volkswagen Jetta in most markets, is assembled in Germany, South Africa, as well as Mexico. (In Mexico this car is known as Bora.) It was followed in 2004 by a new Golf Variant. The front ends of the car are the same, with the only difference being that the GLI is a sedan, while the GTI is a hatchback.
Later models of the Mk5 introduced the 1.4 TSI turbocharged petrol engine with front-wheel drive.
In a comparison test conducted by Car and Driver Magazine, the Volkswagen Rabbit S was named the winner among eight small cars. While it was praised for its excellent driving position, fine instruments, and strong engine, it was criticized for having high levels of road noise, uncomfortable seats, and poor fuel economy. Though, the final verdict stated, "This one is all about driving pleasure, so it wins." The Rabbit also placed first in their final comparison in December 2006.
The Golf Plus was also introduced in 2004. This was a slightly larger version of the Golf Mk5 with a higher roofline.

===VW Golf GTI W12===

In 2007, VW built a concept car based on the Golf Mk5 featuring a 6.0 litre W12 engine from the Volkswagen Phaeton. The engine was twin-turbocharged and tuned to provide an extra 200 bhp, giving 641 bhp. Volkswagen claimed that the car could accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 3.7 seconds. The Golf GTI W12 was rear wheel drive, using a six-speed automatic gearbox.
The body was extensively modified to carry the engine, widened and given a rear spoiler to improve handling.
The W12 engine was placed in the middle of the car to improve the car's grip.[tpl]cite web|author=Ian Dickson|url=http://cars.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=148151390 |title=Revealed: 641bhp VW Golf GTi |publisher=cars.uk.msn.com |date=18 May 2007|accessdate=2012-10-20[/tpl]

==[tpl]Anchor|A6|5K[/tpl]Sixth generation (A6, Typ 5K; 2008–2013)==

Volkswagen based the Golf Mk6 on the existing PQ35 platform from the Golf Mk5.Wall Street Journal VW to Cut Costs to Produce Golf 9 June 2008; pg B2 This vehicle was debuted at the 2008 Paris Motor Show.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autobild.de/artikel/erste-fotos-vom-vw-golf-vi_759923.html|title=Erste Fotos vom VW Golf VI – Das ist der neue Golf – News|publisher=autobild.de |accessdate=12 October 2009[/tpl]
The Mk6 Golf was designed by Volkswagen's chief designer Walter de'Silva.  The design is said to be more aerodynamic, helping fuel efficiency, and is quieter than its predecessor.  Following criticism of the downgraded interior trim quality of the Mk5 Golf in comparison to the Mk4, Volkswagen opted to overhaul the interior to match the quality with the Mk4 Golf, while maintaining the same user friendliness from the Mk5.  The car is also cheaper to build than its predecessor; Volkswagen claims it consequently will be able to pass these savings on to the customer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whatcar.com/news-special-report.aspx?NA=234338&EL=3253020| title=New VW Golf revealed – Introduction – Car and Car-Buying News – What Car?|publisher=Whatcar.com |date=6 August 2008|accessdate=12 October 2009[/tpl]
The MK6 Jetta was released in Mexico in mid-2010, and by late 2011 will be available in all markets around the globe.
Turbocharged Direct Injection diesel engines which use the common rail direct injection will replace the longstanding Pumpe/Düse (PD) Unit Injector system. New on the Golf, is the optional Volkswagen Adaptive Chassis Control (not available in the North American market), which allows the driver to select between 'normal', 'comfort' and 'sports' modes, which will vary the suspension, steering and accelerator behavior accordingly.[tpl]cite web|last=Tan |first=Paul |url=http://paultan.org/archives/2008/08/06/6th-generation-volkswagen-golf-details-and-photos/ |title=6th Generation Volkswagen Golf Details and Photos |publisher=Paultan.org |accessdate=15 October 2010[/tpl]
The Mk6 Golf is available with both 5- and 6-speed manual transmission, and 6- or 7-speed DSG (Dual Clutch) transmission options. In America, the MK5 version was originally sold as the Rabbit from 2006-2009. In 2010, Volkswagen brought back the Golf nameplate with the mid-cycle refresh. With it brought a 170 hp, 2.5 liter I-5 with 240 Nm (177 lb-ft) of torque and a 2.0 liter, 140 hp turbocharged I-4 clean diesel engine that generates 320 Nm (236 lb-ft) of torque. The GTI version is equipped with a 200 hp, turbocharged I-4 TSI gas engine while the Golf R has a 256 hp turbocharged TFSI I-4 engine. All three engines can be paired with a DSG dual-clutch 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmission in either a 3- or 5-door configuration.

The Golf VII, Typ 5G[tpl]Citation |work=Volkswagen Elektronischer Teilekatalog |language=German |issue=931 |publisher=Lex-Com GmbH[/tpl] uses the new MQB platform, shared with the third-generation Audi A3, SEAT León and Škoda Octavia. It is slightly larger than the Mk6 while managing to be approximately 100 kg lighter, depending on engine choice. The GTI will offer a 217 bhp turbocharged 2.0 litre four-cylinder with an available performance pack to raise the output to 227 bhp.[tpl]cite web |last=Vijayenthiran |first=Viknesh |title=2014 Volkswagen Golf GTI Previewed In Paris By Concept |publisher=Motorauthority.com |date=2012-09-27 |url= http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1079419_2014-volkswagen-golf-gti-concept-2012-paris-auto-show |accessdate=2013-02-08[/tpl]
The Golf line is available in all the relevant drive systems: the Golf TSI, including GTI, is gasoline-powered; Golf TDI, including GTD, is diesel-powered; the Golf TGI is powered by compressed natural gas (CNG); the e-Golf is powered by electricity; and the Golf GTE is a plug-in hybrid. The use of a modular transverse matrix assembly kit enables the manufacturing of Golf models with gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electric and hybrid drives from bumper to bumper at Volkswagen factories.

==Electric versions==

The VW Golf has had several generations made into electric CityStromer models. The first of these was in the 1970s, when VW took a standard Golf Mk1 and converted it to electric power. By the time the Golf Mk2 came into production a limited number of electric Golfs were made, using lead–acid battery packs and a custom-made motor and controller[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]. VW continued with the production of limited numbers of CityStromer electric cars with the introduction of the Golf Mk3. The electric CityStromer Mk3 included a Siemens-based AC drive system, and lead–acid battery packs. They had a maximum speed of [tpl]convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] and a range of approximately [tpl]convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.citystromer.cz/index_en.html |title=CitySTROMer |publisher=Citystromer.cz |accessdate=15 October 2010[/tpl] With a few exceptions, only left-hand drive Golfs were converted by VW into Citystromer models. These vehicles are still used today and have popularity in mainland Europe with only a few present in Great Britain. Only two right-hand drive Mk2 CityStromers were built for the UK market and it is believed only one remains today. It is owned by EV advocate and broadcaster Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield, host of Transport Evolved.The CityStromer EV on PositiveTV

===Golf Variant Twin Drive===

As part of the "Fleet study in electric mobility" project that began in 2008, VW developed 20 Golf Variant twinDRIVE plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. These research vehicles have an all-electric range of [tpl]Convert|57|km|abbr=on[/tpl] and the internal combustion engine provides for a total range of [tpl]Convert|900|km|abbr=on[/tpl]. The plug-in hybrid drive of the Golf Variant twinDRIVE is equipped with either an 11.2 kWh or a 13.2 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, as Volkswagen is testing packs from two vendors. Ten vehicles are equipped with batteries from the American-German manufacturer GAIA with cathode type nickel cobalt aluminium dioxide (NCA). The other ten are powered by lithium-ion batteries with nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cathodes from the Korean-German joint venture SB LiMotive (Samsung and Bosch). These 10 vehicles have been in use since early 2011. Both battery systems offer high power and energy density. They each weigh about 150 kg. The gasoline engine is used to support the electric heating system when outdoor temperatures are low.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/06/vw-20110629.html|title=Volkswagen presents status of fleet study in electromobility; latest generation of twïnDRIVE plug-in hybrid|publisher=Green Car Congress|date=2011-06-29|accessdate=2011-06-30[/tpl]
Using guidelines for determining the fuel consumption of plug-in hybrids, VW estimates a fuel consumption of 2.1 L/100 km (112 mpg US), which is equivalent to 49 g/km CO2. When the battery is fully charged, the Golf Variant twinDRIVE is design to maximize the share of pure electrical energy used for driving, and only when longer distances are driven does the share of supplemental gasoline fuel increase. Top speed of the car is [tpl]Convert|170|km/h[/tpl] and it accelerates to 100 km/h in under 12 seconds. When operated in pure electric mode, the Golf Variant twinDRIVE can reach a top speed of [tpl]Convert|120|km/h[/tpl].
The production version was expected to be based on Mk6 Golf featuring a 1.5 L turbodiesel engine and electric motor, with estimated arrival date of 2015.[tpl]cite web|last=Vijayenthiran |first=Viknesh |url=http://www.motorauthority.com/volkswagen-twin-drive-plug-in-hybrids-not-due-until-2015.html |title=VW Twin Drive plug-in hybrids not due until 2015 |publisher=Motorauthority.com |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=15 October 2010[/tpl] A SEAT León prototype with the Twin Drive system was also under development.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
