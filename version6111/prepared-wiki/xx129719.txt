"Touch, Peel and Stand" is known for its raw, acoustic feel and maintains considerable radio play to this day. Despite the fact that Travis Meeks writes all songs by Days of the New, and considers it his own personal project, he has praised Matt Taul's cymbal-heavy percussion in the song. In a 2008 interview, Meeks noted, "As far as Iâ€™m concerned, he owns the track."Herron, Matt "You're talking to a miracle - Travis Meeks heals one piece at a time" LEOWeekly.com (July 16, 2008).
