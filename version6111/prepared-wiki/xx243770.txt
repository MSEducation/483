DNASTAR is a bioinformatics software company headquartered in Madison, WI that develops desktop computer software for DNA, RNA, and protein sequence analysis, including Sanger and next-generation sequence assembly.
==History== 
DNASTAR was incorporated in 1984. Its primary software product, Lasergene, is used by molecular biology researchers and geneticists for DNA and protein sequence assembly and analysis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dnastar.com/t-about.aspx|title=Company Profile|publisher=DNASTAR|accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl]
The initial version of Lasergene was released in 1986, and it has since grown in its capabilities. The latest version, Lasergene 10, was released in March 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dnastar.com/skins/skin_1/pdf/DNASTAR_Lasergene_10_2012.pdf|title=DNASTAR Releases Lasergene 10 Software and SeqNinja|publisher=DNASTAR|accessdate=30 July 2012[/tpl] The software supports virtual restriction enzyme cloning as well as TOPO cloning, and cloning using the Gateway technology. Lasergene has also added the functions to do BLAST and FASTA search and utilize multiple alignment methods including Clustal.
In June 2007, the company introduced its ArrayStar software for microarray gene expression analysis.  The latest version of ArrayStar, version 5.0, which was released in 2011, also includes an optional module, QSeq, to allow scientists to visualize and analyze RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data using the same tools as are used for microarray gene expression.
In October 2007, the company introduced SeqMan NGen to assemble data from Next Generation sequencing platforms. When used along with Lasergene, SeqMan NGen permits researchers to assemble and analyze data from sequencing projects from both traditional and next generation sequencing technologies. Lasergene's use in Next Generation sequence assembly and analysis software was contributed as a chapter, written by company scientists, to the 2008 book Next Generation Genome Sequencing edited by Michael Janitz.

In 2008, DNASTAR was awarded a Reader's Choice Gold Award by Scientific Computing Magazine for the Lasergene sequence analysis software.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scientificcomputing.com/bioinformatics-readers-choice-062907-1.aspx|title=Bioinformatics Readers' Choice — Gold Award: Lasergene|publisher=Advantage Business Media|accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl]
The 2008 book Inventing Entrepreneurs: Technology Innovators and their Entrepreneurial Journey by Gerard George and Adam J. Bock includes DNASTAR as an example of an innovative and entrepreneurial success story.

A research study by BMC Genomics in 2010 determined that SeqMan assemblies performed best, with more novel sequences and better recapitulation of transcripts.

Another BMC Genomics study in 2011 determined that the best overall contig performance resulted from a SeqMan NGen assembly.
