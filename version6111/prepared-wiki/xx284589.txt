Fort Defiance was a fort that existed from 1774 to around 1865 on Fort Point in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Originally named Fort Lillie, it was renamed in 1814, burned in 1833, and rebuilt in 1851. Prior to the establishment of the fort, the British Fort Anne was located here, and was built in 1703, and rebuilt in 1743. Currently, nothing remains of the fort.[tpl]cite web|title=Massachusetts|url=http://www.northamericanforts.com/East/ma.html#defiance|publisher=American Forts Network|accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]
