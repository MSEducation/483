The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is a non-profit organization in the United States. Members serve pro bono as "advisers to the nation on science, engineering, and medicine". As a  national academy, new members of the organization are elected annually by current members, based on their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research. Election to the National Academy is one of the high honors in U.S. science.
The National Academy of Sciences is part of the National Academies, which also includes: 
The group holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code.

==Overview==

===Origin===

The Act of Incorporation, signed by President Abraham Lincoln on March 3, 1863, created the National Academy of Sciences and named 50 charter members. Many of the original NAS members came from the so-called "Scientific Lazzaroni", an informal network of mostly physical scientists working in the vicinity of Cambridge, Massachusetts (c. 1850).[tpl]cite web|author=ITS |url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/archives/nasfounding.html |title=Founding of the National Academy of Sciences |publisher=.nationalacademies.org |accessdate=2012-03-12[/tpl]
In 1863, enlisting the support of Alexander Dallas Bache and Charles Henry Davis, a professional astronomer recently recalled from the Navy to Washington to head the Bureau of Navigation, Louis Agassiz and Benjamin Peirce planned the steps whereby the National Academy of Sciences was to be established. Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts was to name Agassiz to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian.For an analysis of the motives by Alexander Dallas Bache for founding the NAS, see Jansen, Axel (2011). Alexander Dallas Bache: Building the American Nation through Science and Education in the Nineteenth Century. Campus. p. 285-314.
Agassiz was to come to Washington at the government's expense to plan the organization with the others. This bypassed Joseph Henry, who was reluctant to have a bill for such an academy presented to Congress. This was in the belief that such a resolution would be "opposed as something at variance with our democratic institutions".  Nevertheless, Henry soon became the second President of NAS. Agassiz, Davis, Peirce,  Benjamin Gould, and Senator Wilson met at Bache's house and "hurriedly wrote the bill incorporating the Academy, including in it the name of fifty incorporators".
During the last hours of the session, when the Senate was immersed in the rush of last minute business before its adjournment, Senator Wilson introduced the bill. Without examining it or debating its provisions, both the Senate and House approved it, and President Lincoln signed it.[ref]

Although hailed as a great step forward in government recognition of the role of science in American civilization, the National Academy of Sciences at the time created enormous ill-feelings among scientists, whether or not they were named as incorporators. Later, Agassiz admitted that they had "started on the wrong track".[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
The Act states:
[tpl]quote|The Academy shall, whenever called upon by any department of the Government, investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art, the actual expense of such investigations, examinations, experiments, and reports to be paid from appropriations which may be made for the purpose, but the Academy shall receive no compensation whatever for any services to the Government of the United States.|An Act to Incorporate the National Academy of Sciences|[tpl]cite web|author=OCGA |url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/Other/Act_to_incorporate.asp |title=An Act to Incorporate the National Academy of Sciences |publisher=.nationalacademies.org |accessdate=2012-03-12[/tpl][/tpl]
The National Academy did not solve the problems facing a nation in Civil War as the Lazzaroni had hoped, nor did it centralize American scientific efforts.
In 1870, the congressional charter was amended to remove the limitation on the number of members.[tpl]cite book|title=A Chronicle of Public Laws Calling for Action by the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, and National Research Council|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PiYrAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA7|accessdate=22 March 2014|year=1985|publisher=National Academies|location=Washington, DC|page=5|id=NAP:11820[/tpl] Stat. 277 and 36 U.S.C. § 252, Accessed at Google Books
