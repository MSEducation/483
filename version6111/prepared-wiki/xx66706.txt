CATEGORIES: Magician of the Year Award winners, American magicians, American comedy duos

Penn & Teller (Penn Jillette and Teller) are American illusionists and entertainers who have performed together since the late 1970s, noted for their ongoing act which combines elements of comedy with magic. The duo, having been featured in numerous stage and television shows, currently headline a show in Las Vegas at The Rio. Penn Jillette serves as the act's orator and raconteur. Teller, however, generally does not speak while performing, and instead communicates through mime and nonverbals, although his voice can occasionally be heard during their show.  Besides magic, the pair have recently become associated with their advocacy of atheism, scientific skepticism, and libertarianism, particularly through their television show Penn & Teller: Bullshit!.

==Career==

Penn Jillette and Teller were introduced to one another by Wier Chrisimer, and performed their first show together at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival on 19 August 1975.[tpl]cite web| url=http://twitter.com/#!/pennjillette/status/104745893533716480|title=Twitter / pennjillette: 36 years ago today,Teller and ...|publisher=Twitter|author=Penn Jillette|date=19 August 2013|accessdate=2013-08-31[/tpl]  From the late 1970s through 1981, Penn, Teller, and Chrisimer performed as a trio called "The Asparagus Valley Cultural Society" which played in San Francisco at the Phoenix Theater. Chrisimer helped to develop some bits that continued, most notably Teller's "Shadows" trick, which involves a single red rose.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] The group disbanded in 1981 after Chrisimer quit show business, leaving Penn Jillette and Teller to work as a pair.
By 1985, Penn & Teller were receiving positive reviews for their Off Broadway show and Emmy Award-winning PBS special, Penn & Teller Go Public.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bookingentertainment.com/artists/comedy/booking-penn-and-teller.php|title=Penn & Teller Booking Agent – Book Penn & Teller Comedian For Corporate and Private Events Worldwide|publisher=Entertainment Booking Agency|work=Artists > Comedy|accessdate=2013-08-31[/tpl] In 1987, they began the first of two successful Broadway runs. Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, the duo made numerous television appearances on Late Night with David Letterman and Saturday Night Live, as well as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Today, and many others.
Penn & Teller had national tours throughout the 1990s, gaining critical praise. They have also made television guest appearances on Babylon 5[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/096.html|title=Penn & Teller on Babylon 5|date=13 July 2004|accessdate=2013-08-31[/tpl] (as the comedy team Rebo and Zooty), The Drew Carey Show, a few episodes of Hollywood Squares from 1998 until 2004, ABC's Muppets Tonight, FOX's The Bernie Mac Show, an episode of the game show Fear Factor on NBC, NBC's The West Wing, in a two-part episode of the final season of ABC's Home Improvement in 1998, four episodes during season 1 of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch in 1996, NBC's Las Vegas, and Fox's The Simpsons episodes "Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder" and "The Great Simpsina" and the Futurama film Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder in 2009. They also appeared as three-card Monte scam artists in the music video for "It's Tricky" by Run-DMC in 1987, and were thrown out of a Las Vegas hotel room in the music video for "Waking Up in Vegas" by Katy Perry in 2009.
Their Showtime network television show Bullshit! took a skeptical look at psychics, religion, the pseudoscientific, conspiracy theories, and the paranormal. It has featured critical segments on gun control, astrology, Feng Shui, environmental issues, PETA, weight loss, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the war on drugs.
On Bullshit!, the duo described their social and political views as libertarian.
They have also described themselves as teetotalers.  Their book, Penn & Teller's How to Play in Traffic, explains that they avoid alcohol, drugs, and caffeine, though they do appear to smoke cigarettes in some videos.
The pair have written several books about magic, including Penn & Teller's Cruel Tricks For Dear Friends, Penn & Teller's How to Play with Your Food, and Penn & Teller's How to Play in Traffic. Since 2001, Penn & Teller have performed six nights a week (or as Penn put it on Bullshit!: "Every night of the week ... except Fridays!") in Las Vegas at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino.
Penn Jillette hosted a weekday one-hour talk show on Infinity Broadcasting's Free FM radio network from January 3, 2006 to March 2, 2007 with cohost Michael Goudeau.Infinity Broadcasting article on PennPenn & Teller website He also hosted the game show Identity, which debuted on December 18, 2006 on NBC.

Penn & Teller have also shown support for the Brights movement[tpl]cite web|url=http://the-brights.net/people/enthusiastic/index2.html|title=The Brights' Net – Enthusiastic Brights (Page 2)|publisher=The-Brights.net|accessdate=2013-01-10[/tpl] and are now listed on the movement's homepage under the Enthusiastic Brights section.The Brights' Net:  Enthusiastic Brights According to an article in Wired magazine, their license plates are customized so they read, "Atheist" and "Godless", and when Penn signs autographs, he sometimes writes "there is no God" with his signature.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/faces2.html|title=The Illusionists| first=Geoffrey|last=Gagnon|date=November 2006|work=Faces of the New Atheism|work=Wired|accessdate  =14 March 2010|quote=Never shy about their atheism (Penn's got the Nevada license plates ATHEIST and GODLESS), the two have been raising their voices – even the oft-silent Teller – to decry the muddying line between church and state...

==Off-stage relationship==

Penn Jillette has told interviewer Larry King[tpl]when|date=October 2013[/tpl] that a big part of the duo's success and longevity is due to them never having been close friends. They respect each other as business partners and enjoy working together, but have little in common besides magic. As a result of their drastically different lifestyles and interests, they rarely socialize or interact when not working. Jillette believes[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] that their partnership succeeds precisely because they give each other a great deal of space off-stage.
Penn later amended this position in a video where he and Teller responded to questions from members of Reddit and also in a video interview for Big Think, stating that while they share few similar interests outside magic, Teller is his best friend and that his children treat him as a close relative. He states that while most entertainment partnerships such as Martin and Lewis and Lennon and McCartney were based on a deep affection for each other that lends to a certain volatility when things go wrong, their business relationship and friendship is based on a respect for each other.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv_Xkz9zepI|title=IAMA: Penn and Teller  reddit's top ten questions |publisher=YouTube|date=October 4, 2011|accessdate=2013-10-23|author=Penn & Teller[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcabRJRG54|title=Penn Jillette: Penn and Teller Are Not Lovers|publisher=YouTube|date= June 13, 2011|accessdate=2013-10-23|author=Penn Jillette[/tpl]

==Honors==

On April 5, 2013 they were honored with the 2,494th star at the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their achievement in the category of their career spanning over 35 years Live Performance. The star is few steps away from the star of Houdini and down the street from The Magic Castle.[tpl]cite web|title=Magicians Penn & Teller get star on Hollywood Walk of Fame|url=http://photos.mercurynews.com/2013/04/05/photos-magicians-penn-teller-get-star-on-hollywood-walk-of-fame/|accessdate=April 6, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Magicians Penn & Teller Get Star On Walk Of Fame|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/04/05/magicians-penn-teller-set-for-walk-of-fame-star/|accessdate=April 6, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Magicians Penn & Teller Honored With Star on Hollywood Walk of Fame|url=http://bhcourier.com/magicians-penn-teller-honored-star-hollywood-walk-fame/2013/04/05|accessdate= April 6, 2013[/tpl]

==Tricks==

Penn and Teller's material varies from light-hearted gags such as gory tricks and clever pranks, to tackling issues through political satire and by exposing frauds. Many of their effects rely heavily on shock appeal and fantasy violence, although presented in a humorous manner. Some of their more daring tricks include Teller hanging upside-down over a cushion of spikes in a straitjacket, Teller submerged in a huge container of water, Teller being run over by an 18-wheel tractor-trailer, and Teller swinging through Penn's hands.
Sometimes, the pair will claim to reveal a secret of how a magic trick is done, but those tricks are usually invented by the duo for the sole purpose of exposing them, and therefore designed with more spectacular and weird methods than would have been necessary had it just been a "proper" magic trick. For example, in the "reveal" of one trick, while Teller waits for his cue, he reads magazines and eats a snack.[tpl]clarify|date=August 2011|reason=How does reading a magazine and eating a snack make for a "more spectacular and weird method"?[/tpl] Another example is their rendition of the cups and balls, using transparent cups.
Penn and Teller perform their own adaptation of the famous bullet catch illusion. Each simultaneously fires a gun at the other through small panes of glass and then "catches" the other's bullet in his mouth. They also have an assortment of card tricks in their repertoire, virtually all of them involving the force of the Three of Clubs on an unsuspecting audience member as this card is easy for viewers to identify on television cameras.Penn & Teller on force trick
The duo will sometimes perform tricks that discuss the intellectual underpinnings of magic. One of their routines, titled "Magician vs. Juggler", features Teller performing card tricks while Penn juggles and delivers a monologue on the difference between the two: jugglers start as socially aware children who go outside and learn juggling with other children; magicians are misfits who stay in the house and teach themselves magic tricks out of spite.
In one of their most politically charged tricks, they make an American flag seem to disappear by wrapping it in a copy of the United States Bill of Rights, and apparently setting the flag on fire, so that "the flag is gone but the Bill of Rights remains." The routine may also feature the "Chinese bill of rights", presented as a transparent piece of acetate. They normally end the trick by restoring the unscathed flag to its starting place on the flagpole; however, on a TV guest appearance on The West Wing this final part was omitted.Guide to West Wing on Penn & Teller
One of their more recent tricks[tpl]Cite episode |title=Penn & Teller – Fool Us |episodelink= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaEC8dgQLIM |accessdate=October 18th, 2012 |series= |serieslink= |credits= |network=ITV |station= |city= |date=July 16, 2011 |began= |ended= |season=1 |seriesno=5 |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote= |language=English[/tpl] involves a powered nail gun with a quantity of missing nails from the series of nails in its magazine.  Penn begins by firing several apparently real nails into a board in front of him.  He then proceeds to fire the nail gun into the palm of his hand several times, while suffering no injuries. His pattern builds as he oscillates between firing blanks into his hand and firing nails into the board, and fires one blank into Teller's crotch. Near the end of the trick he says it is a trick and that he and Teller believe that it is morally wrong to do things on stage that are really dangerous—it makes the audience complicit in unnecessary human risk.Penn Says: Nail Gun Trick
A trick introduced in 2010 is a modern version of the bag escape, replacing the traditional sack with a black trash bag apparently filled with helium.  Teller is placed in the bag which is then pumped full of helium and sealed by an audience member.  For the escape, the audience is blinded by a bright light for a second and when they are able to see again, Teller has escaped from the bag and Penn is holding it, still full of helium, above his head, before releasing it to float to the ceiling.  The duo had hoped to put the trick in their mini-tour in London; however, it was first shown to the public in their Las Vegas show on 18 August 2010. In June 2011, Penn and Teller performed this trick for the first time in the United Kingdom on their ITV show Fool Us.Twitter / MrTeller: Helium went in tonight. It

===Video games===

The 1995 video game Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors featured a mini-game called Desert Bus in which the player drove a bus route between Tucson and Las Vegas. Once reaching the destination, the player gets one point and, if desired, can then drive the return route. The game was considered by some http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2006/03/penn_jillette_discusses_unrele.php Penn Jillette Discusses Unreleased Sega CD Game to be long and boring, but found a cult audience.http://desertbus.org/ Desertbus.org
The game has since been used in an annual charity event called "Desert Bus for Hope" run by the website desertbus.org. The site invites celebrities to play the game streamed live online, with all proceeds being donated to Child's Play. On November 14, 2011 an iOS port of Desert Bus was created and released in the iTunes Store. The game was developed in conjunction with the Desert Bus For Hope event and all profits from the game are donated to charity.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
