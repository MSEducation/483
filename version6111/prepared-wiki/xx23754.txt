The soybean (US) or soya bean (UK) (Glycine max)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.plantnames.unimelb.edu.au/Sorting/Glycine.html#max|title= Glycine max|publisher= Multilingual Multiscript Plant Name Database|accessdate=February 16, 2012[/tpl] is a species of legume native to East Asia, widely grown for its edible bean which has numerous uses. The plant is classed as an oilseed rather than a pulse by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO).
Fat-free (defatted) soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many prepackaged meals; soy vegetable oil is another product of processing the soybean crop. For example, soybean products such as textured vegetable protein (TVP) are ingredients in many meat and dairy analogues.[tpl]cite book |last=Riaz|first=Mian N.|title=Soy Applications in Food |publisher= CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |year=2006 |isbn=0-8493-2981-7[/tpl] Soybeans produce significantly more protein per acre than most other uses of land.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nsrl.uiuc.edu/soy_benefits.html|publisher=National Soybean Research Laboratory|title=Soy Benefits|accessdate =February 16, 2012[/tpl]
Traditional nonfermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk, and from the latter tofu and tofu skin. Fermented foods include soy sauce, fermented bean paste, natto, and tempeh, among others. The oil is used in many industrial applications. The main producers of soy are the United States (35%), Brazil (27%), Argentina (19%), China (6%) and India (4%).World Soybean Production 2010.[tpl]cite web|title=Growing Crush Limits India’s Soy Oil Imports|work=Oilseeds:World Markets and Trade|format=PDF|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2011/March/oilseeds.pdf| publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=February 17, 2012[/tpl] The beans contain significant amounts of phytic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and isoflavones.

==Name==

The plant is known as the "large bean" in [tpl]zh|c=(大豆|p=dàdòu[/tpl]; Japanese daizu) or yellow bean, ([tpl]zh|c=黄豆|p=huángdòu[/tpl]). Both the immature soybean and its dish are called edamame in Japan,[tpl]cite web | title=枝豆 | url=http://eow.alc.co.jp/search?q=%e6%9e%9d%e8%b1%86&ref=sa|publisher=ALC Networks Inc.|accessdate=February 17, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=History of Edamame, Green Vegetable Soybeans, and Vegetable-Type Soybeans | url=http://www.soyinfocenter.com/books/133 | publisher=Soyinfo Center | accessdate=February 17, 2012[/tpl] but in English, edamame refers only to a specific dish.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] The genus name, Glycine, is the same as a simple amino acid.
Since the early  twentieth century soybeans have been called the 'golden bean' or 'miracle bean' in America.http://www.soyatech.com/news_story.php?id=31959

==Classification==

The genus Glycine Willd. is divided into two subgenera, Glycine and Soja. The subgenus Soja (Moench) F.J. Herm. includes the cultivated soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., and the wild soybean, Glycine soja Sieb. & Zucc. Both species are annuals. Glycine soja is the wild ancestor of Glycine max, and grows wild in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Russia.[tpl]cite book|first1 = Ram J.|last1 =Singh|first2 = Randall L.|last2 = Nelson|first3 = Gyuhwa| last3 = Chung|title = Genetic Resources, Chromosome Engineering, and Crop Improvement: Oilseed Crops, Volume 4|publisher = Taylor & Francis|location=London|date = November 2, 2006|page = 15|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lQ9bcjETlrIC&lpg=PA15&pg=PA15|isbn=978-0-8493-3639-3[/tpl] The subgenus Glycine consists of at least 25 wild perennial species: for example, Glycine canescens F.J. Herm. and G. tomentella Hayata, both found in Australia and Papua New Guinea.[ref]

Like some other crops of long domestication, the relationship of the modern soybean to wild-growing species can no longer be traced with any degree of certainty. It is a cultural variety with a very large number of cultivars.

==Description and physical characteristics==

Soy varies in growth and habit. The height of the plant varies from less than [tpl]convert|0.2|to|2.0|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].
The pods, stems, and leaves are covered with fine brown or gray hairs. The leaves are trifoliolate, having three to four leaflets per leaf, and the leaflets are [tpl]convert|6|–|15|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|2|–|7|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] broad. The leaves fall before the seeds are mature. The inconspicuous, self-fertile flowers are borne in the axil of the leaf and are white, pink or purple.
The fruit is a hairy pod that grows in clusters of three to five, each pod is 3–8 cm long (1–3 in) and usually contains two to four (rarely more) seeds 5–11 mm in diameter.
Soybeans occur in various sizes, and in many hull or seed coat colors, including black, brown, blue, yellow, green and mottled. The hull of the mature bean is hard, water-resistant, and protects the cotyledon and hypocotyl (or "germ") from damage. If the seed coat is cracked, the seed will not germinate. The scar, visible on the seed coat, is called the hilum (colors include black, brown, buff, gray and yellow) and at one end of the hilum is the micropyle, or small opening in the seed coat which can allow the absorption of water for sprouting.
Remarkably, seeds such as soybeans containing very high levels of protein can undergo desiccation, yet survive and revive after water absorption. A. Carl Leopold, son of Aldo Leopold, began studying this capability at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University in the mid-1980s. He found soybeans and corn to have a range of soluble carbohydrates protecting the seed's cell viability.[tpl]cite journal |pages=225–30 |doi=10.1104/pp.100.1.225 |title=Maturation Proteins and Sugars in Desiccation Tolerance of Developing Soybean Seeds |year=1992 |last1=Blackman |first1=S. A. |last2=Obendorf |first2=R. L. |last3=Leopold |first3=A. C. |journal=Plant Physiology |volume=100 |pmid=16652951 |issue=1|publisher=American Society of Plant Biologists|pmc=1075542[/tpl] Patents were awarded to him in the early 1990s on techniques for protecting "biological membranes" and proteins in the dry state. Compare to tardigrades.

==Nitrogen-fixing ability==

Many legumes (alfalfa, clover, lupins, peas, beans, lentils, soybeans, peanuts and others) contain symbiotic bacteria called Rhizobia within nodules of their root systems. These bacteria have the special ability of fixing nitrogen from atmospheric, molecular nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3).[tpl]cite web|title=The Nitrogen cycle and Nitrogen fixation|author=Jim Deacon|publisher=Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology, The University of Edinburgh|url=http://www.biology.ed.ac.uk/archive/jdeacon/microbes/nitrogen.htm[/tpl] The chemical reaction is:
Ammonia is then converted to another form, ammonium (NH4+), usable by (some) plants by the following reaction:
This arrangement means that the root nodules are sources of nitrogen for legumes, making them relatively rich in plant proteins.

==Chemical composition of the seed==

Together, soybean oil and protein content account for about 60% of dry soybeans by weight (protein at 40% and oil at 20%). The remainder consists of 35% carbohydrate and about 5% ash. Soybean cultivars comprise approximately 8% seed coat or hull, 90% cotyledons and 2% hypocotyl axis or germ.
Most soy protein is a relatively heat-stable storage protein. This heat stability enables soy food products requiring high temperature cooking, such as tofu, soy milk and textured vegetable protein (soy flour) to be made.
The principal soluble carbohydrates of mature soybeans are the disaccharide sucrose (range 2.5–8.2%), the trisaccharide raffinose (0.1–1.0%) composed of one sucrose molecule connected to one molecule of galactose, and the tetrasaccharide stachyose (1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one sucrose connected to two molecules of galactose.Soluble Carbohydrates in Soybean | InTechOpen While the oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose protect the viability of the soybean seed from desiccation (see above section on physical characteristics) they are not digestible sugars, so contribute to flatulence and abdominal discomfort in humans and other monogastric animals, comparable to the disaccharide trehalose. Undigested oligosaccharides are broken down in the intestine by native microbes, producing gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane.
Since soluble soy carbohydrates are found in the whey and are broken down during fermentation, soy concentrate, soy protein isolates, tofu, soy sauce, and sprouted soybeans are without flatus activity. On the other hand, there may be some beneficial effects to ingesting oligosaccharides such as raffinose and stachyose, namely, encouraging indigenous bifidobacteria in the colon against putrefactive bacteria.
The insoluble carbohydrates in soybeans consist of the complex polysaccharides cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. The majority of soybean carbohydrates can be classed as belonging to dietary fiber.
Within soybean oil or the lipid portion of the seed is contained four phytosterols: stigmasterol, sitosterol, campesterol,and brassicasterol  accounting for about 2.5% of the lipid fraction; and which can be converted into steroid hormones.From Soybean Phytosterols to Steroid Hormones | InTechOpenhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2014/04/11/todays-google-doodle-honors-pioneering-medicinal-chemist/http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2014/04/11/percy-julian-google-doodle-salutes-pioneering-chemist-as-a-man-utterly-in-his-elements/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/urban-scientist/2014/04/11/google-doodle-honors-chemist-dr-percy-julian/
Saponins, a class of natural surfactants (soaps), are sterols that are present naturally in a wide variety of food-plants: vegetables, legumes, and cereals–ranging from beans and spinach to tomatoes, potatoes and oats. Whole soybeans contain from 0.17 to 6.16% saponins, 0.35 to 2.3% in defatted soy flour and 0.06 to 1.9% in tofu. Legumes such as soybean and chickpeas are the major source of saponins in the human diet. Sources of non-dietary saponins include alfalfa, sunflower, herbs and barbasco.
Soy contains isoflavones like genistein and daidzein. It also contains glycitein, an O-methylated isoflavone which accounts for 5–10% of the total isoflavones in soy food products. Glycitein is a phytoestrogen with weak estrogenic activity, comparable to that of the other soy isoflavones.[tpl]cite journal |author=Song TT, Hendrich S, Murphy PA |title=Estrogenic activity of glycitein, a soy isoflavone |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=1607–1610 |year=1999 |pmid=10564025 |doi=10.1021/jf981054j[/tpl]

===Nutrition===

For human consumption, soybeans must be cooked with "wet" heat to destroy the trypsin inhibitors (serine protease inhibitors). Raw soybeans, including the immature green form, are toxic to all monogastric animals.[tpl]cite book |author=Circle, Sidney Joseph; Smith, Allan H. |title=Soybeans: Chemistry and Technology |publisher=Avi Publishing|location=Westport, CT|year=1972|pages= 104, 163|isbn=0-87055-111-6[/tpl]
Soybeans are considered by many agencies to be a source of complete protein.[ref]
[tpl]cite journal|last=Henkel |first=John |title=Soy:Health Claims for Soy Protein, Question About Other Components|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_3_34/ai_62298457/?tag=content;col1 |journal=FDA Consumer|publisher = Food and Drug Administration|date=May–June 2000|volume=34|issue=3|pages=18–20|pmid=11521249[/tpl][/ref] A complete protein is one that contains significant amounts of all the essential amino acids that must be provided to the human body because of the body's inability to synthesize them. For this reason, soy is a good source of protein, amongst many others, for vegetarians and vegans or for people who want to reduce the amount of meat they eat. According to the US Food and Drug Administration:
 Soy protein products can be good substitutes for animal products because, unlike some other beans, soy offers a 'complete' protein profile. ... Soy protein products can replace animal-based foods—which also have complete proteins but tend to contain more fat, especially saturated fat—without requiring major adjustments elsewhere in the diet. 
The gold standard for measuring protein quality, since 1990, is the Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) and by this criterion soy protein is the nutritional equivalent of meat, eggs, and casein for human growth and health. Soybean protein isolate has a biological value of 74, whole soybeans 96, soybean milk 91, and eggs 97.[tpl]cite book|title=Protein Quality Evaluation: Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (Food and Nutrition Paper No. 51)|location=Bethesda, MD (USA)|date=December 1989|isbn=92-5-103097-9[/tpl]
Soy protein is essentially identical to the protein of other legume seeds and pulses.[ref]

====Comparison to other major staple foods====

The following table shows the nutrient content of green soybean and other major staple foods, each in respective raw form. Raw soybeans, however, aren't edible and cannot be digested. These must be sprouted, or prepared and cooked for human consumption. In sprouted and cooked form, the relative nutritional and anti-nutritional contents of each of these grains is remarkably different from that of raw form of these grains reported in this table. The nutritional value of soybean and each cooked staple depends on the pre-processing and the method of cooking: boiling, frying, roasting, baking, etc.

==The near universality of soy protein==

All spermatophytes except for the grass cereal family contain soybean-like 7S (vicilin) and/or 11S (legumin), {S denotes Svedberg, sedimentation coefficients} desiccation-tolerant seed storage globulin proteins. Oats and rice are anomalous in that they also contain a majority of soybean-like protein.Seed Proteins; Peter R. Shewery and Rod Casey (Eds) 1999. Kluwer Academic Publishers,Dordrecht,The Netherlands Cocoa, for example, contains the 7S globulin, which contributes to cocoa/chocolate taste and aroma;,http://openagricola.nal.usda.gov/Record/IND44131228http://openagricola.nal.usda.gov/Record/IND20412524http://library.osu.edu/assets/Uploads/ScienceCafe/Barringer020310.pdf whereas coffee beans (coffee grounds) contain the 11S globulin responsible for coffee's aroma and flavor.http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf801734mhttp://www.alice.cnptia.embrapa.br/bitstream/doc/880533/1/Comparativeproteomical.pdf
Vicilin and legumin proteins, belong to the cupin superfamily, a large and functionally diverse 'superfamily' of proteins that have a common origin and whose evolution can be followed from bacteria to eukaryotes including animals and higher plants.http://link.springer.com/article/10.1134%2FS0026893311030162
2S albumins form a major group of homologous storage proteins in many dicot species and in some monocots but not in grasses (cereals).Youle RJ and Huang AHC: Occurrence of low molecular weight and high cysteine containing albumin storage proteins in oilseed of diverse species.Am J Botany 68:44-48,1981 Soybeans contain a small but significant 2S storage protein.[tpl]cite journal | pmc = 2570561 | pmid=18949071 | doi=10.2174/1874091X00802010016 | volume=2 | title=2S Albumin Storage Proteins: What Makes them Food Allergens? | year=2008 | journal=Open Biochem J | pages=16–28[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | pmc = 3326064 | pmid=22514740 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0035409 | volume=7 | issue=4 | title=Scalable purification and characterization of the anticancer lunasin peptide from soybean | year=2012 | journal=PLoS ONE | pages=e35409[/tpl]http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091202153946.htm 2S albumin are grouped in the prolamin superfamily.http://www.meduniwien.ac.at/allergens/allfam/factsheet.php?allfam_id=AF050 Other allergenic proteins included in this 'superfamily' are the non-specific plant lipid transfer proteins, alpha amylase inhibitor, trypsin inhibitors, and prolamin storage proteins of cereals and grasses.
Peanuts, for instance, contain 20% 2S albumin but only 6% 7S globulin and 74% 11S. It is the high 2S albumin and low 7S globulin that is responsible for the relatively low quality (low lysine) of peanut protein compared to soy protein. Cereal storage prolamins are likewise low in lysine, the most important and first limiting amino acid. Peanut butter and wheat bread, therefore, do not complement each other as they each suffer from low lysine.

==Cultivation==

Soybeans are a globally important crop, providing oil and protein. In the United States, the bulk of the harvest is solvent-extracted with hexane, and the "toasted" defatted soymeal (50% protein) then makes possible the raising of farm animals (e.g. chicken, hog, turkey) on an industrial scale never before seen in human history. A very small proportion of the crop is consumed directly by humans.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Soybean products do, however, appear in a large variety of processed foods.
During World War II, soybeans became important in both North America and Europe chiefly as substitutes for other protein foods and as a source of edible oil. During World War II, the soybean was discovered as fertilizer by the United States Department of Agriculture. In the 1960–1 Dillon round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the United States secured tariff-free access for its soybeans to the European market. In the 1960s, the United States exported over 90% of the world's soybeans.[tpl]cite book|last=Patel|first=Raj|title=Stuffed & Starved From Farm to Fork, the Hidden Battle for the World Food System|publisher=Portobello Books Ltd.|location=Londo|year=2008|pages=169–173|isbn=1-933633-49-2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Wik|first=Reynold Millard|title=Henry Ford's Science and Technology for Rural America|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=3|issue=3|date=Summer 1962|pages=247–258|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press on behalf of the Society for the History of Technology|doi=10.2307/3100818[/tpl] By 2005, the top soybeans exporters were Argentina (39% of world soybean exports), United States (37%) and Brazil (16%), while top importers were China (41% of world soybean imports), European Union (22%), Japan (6%) and Mexico (6%).[tpl]cite web|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/21109/1/sp06so03.pdf|format=PDF|title=Competitive Analysis of Chinese Soybean Import Suppliers—U.S., Brazil, and Argentina|author= Baohui Song, Mary A.

Cultivation is successful in climates with hot summers, with optimum growing conditions in mean temperatures of [tpl]convert|20|to|30|C|F[/tpl]; temperatures of below 20 °C and over 40 °C (68 °F, 104 °F) stunt growth significantly. They can grow in a wide range of soils, with optimum growth in moist alluvial soils with a good organic content. Soybeans, like most legumes, perform nitrogen fixation by establishing a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum (syn. Rhizobium japonicum; Jordan 1982). For best results, though, an inoculum of the correct strain of bacteria should be mixed with the soybean (or any legume) seed before planting. Modern crop cultivars generally reach a height of around [tpl]convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], and take 80–120 days from sowing to harvesting.

==History==

Soybeans were a crucial crop in East Asia long before written records began.Shurtleff, William; Aoyagi, Akiko. 2013. History of Whole Dry Soybeans, Used as Beans, or Ground, Mashed or Flaked (240 BCE to 2013). Lafayette, California. 950 pp. Their cultivation  was long confined chiefly to China, but gradually spread to other countries to become a major crop in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, India, China, and Korea. Prior to fermented products such as soy sauce, tempeh, natto, and miso, soy was considered sacred for its beneficial effects in crop rotation. Soy was introduced to Africa from China in the late 19th century, and is now widespread across the continent.

===North America===

Soybeans were first  introduced to North America in 1765, by Samuel Bowen, a former East India Company sailor who had visited China in conjunction with James Flint. Bowen grew soy near Savannah, Georgia, possibly using funds from Flint, and made soy sauce for sale to England.[tpl]cite book|title=Eat Your Food!

William Morse is considered the 'father' of modern soybean agriculture in America. He and Charles Piper, Dr. C.V. Piper, took what was an unknown Oriental peasant crop in 1910 and transformed it into a 'golden bean' for America becoming one of America's largest farm crops and its most nutritious.http://www.soyinfocenter.com/HSS/morse_and_piper.phphttp://www.soyinfocenter.com/books/147http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Soybean.html?id=MzJ9nQEACAAJ
Prior to the 1920, soy was considered an industrial product only in the US, and was not used as a food. However, it took on an important role after World War I. During the Great Depression, the drought-stricken (Dust Bowl) regions of the United States were able to use soy to regenerate their soil because of its nitrogen-fixing properties. Farms were increasing production to meet with government demands, and Henry Ford became a great leader in the soybean industry.
In 1931, Ford hired chemists Robert Boyer and Frank Calvert to produce artificial silk. They succeeded in making a textile fiber of spun soy protein fibers, hardened or tanned in a formaldehyde bath, which was given the name Azlon. It was usable in the making of suits, felt hats, and overcoats. Though pilot production of Azlon reached 5000 pounds per day in 1940, it never reached the commercial market; Dupont's nylon was the winner in the quest to produce artificial silk. In 1932–33, the Ford Motor Company spent approximately $1,250,000 on soybean research. By 1935, every Ford car had soy involved in its manufacture. For example, soybean oil was used to paint the automobiles,[tpl]cite book|author=Joe Schwarcz|title=The Fly in the Ointment: 63 Fascinating Commentaries on the Science of Everyday Life|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rmIbClRzfeoC&pg=PA193|accessdate=4 May 2013|year=2004|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-621-8|page=193[/tpl] as well as fluid for shock absorbers. Ford's involvement with the soybean opened many doors for agriculture and industry to be linked more strongly than ever before.
Henry Ford promoted the soybean, helping to develop uses for it both in food and in industrial products, even demonstrating auto body panels made of soy-based plastics. Ford's interest led to two bushels (120 pounds)[tpl]cite web|title=Tables for Weights and Measurement: Crops – Table 1 Weights per bushel|url=http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G4020|publisher=University of Missouri|accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl] of soybeans being used in each Ford car, as well as products like the first commercial soy milk, ice cream and all-vegetable nondairy whipped topping. The Ford development of so-called soy-based plastics was based on the addition of soybean flour and wood flour to phenol formaldehyde plastics.[tpl]cite web|title=Henry Ford's Eco-Friendly Automobile| publisher = Harbay|url=http://www.harbay.net/henryford.html|accessdate =February 18, 2012[/tpl] A prototype vehicle, colloquially titled the "Soybean Car", was built in 1941 out of such plastics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehenryford.org/research/soybeancar.aspx|title=Soybean Car|publisher=The Henry Ford|accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl]

==Genetic modification==

Soybeans are one of the "biotech food" crops that have been genetically modified, and genetically modified soybeans are being used in an increasing number of products. In 1995, Monsanto Company introduced glyphosate-tolerant soybeans that have been genetically modified to be resistant to Monsanto's glyphosate herbicides through substitution of the Agrobacterium sp. (strain CP4) gene EPSP (5-enolpyruvyl shikimic acid-3-phosphate) synthase. The substituted version is not sensitive to glyphosate.[tpl]cite journal |pages=1451–1461 |doi=10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500050032x |title=Development, Identification, and Characterization of a Glyphosate-Tolerant Soybean Line |year=1995 |last1=Padgette |first1=S.

In 2010, the figure was 93%.National Agricultural Statistics Board annual report, June 30, 2010. Retrieved July 23, 2010. As with other glyphosate-tolerant crops, concern is expressed over damage to biodiversity.[tpl]cite book |last= Liu |first= KeShun |title= Soybeans: Chemistry, Technology, and Utilization |year=1997 |publisher= Springer |location=Berlin|isbn= 0-8342-1299-4 |page= 532[/tpl] A 2003 study[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.2135/cropsci2003.0409 |author=Sneller CH |title=Impact of Transgenic Genotypes and Subdivision on Diversity Within Elite North American Soybean Germplasm |journal=Crop Science |volume=43 |pages=409–414 |year=2003[/tpl] concluded the RR gene had been bred into so many different soybean cultivars, there had been little decline in genetic diversity, but "diversity was limited among elite lines from some companies".
The widespread use of such types of GM soybeans in the Americas has caused problems with exports to some regions. GM crops require extensive certification before they can be legally imported into the European Union, where there is considerable supplier and consumer reluctance to use GM products for consumer or animal use. Difficulties with coexistence and subsequent traces of cross-contamination of non-GM stocks have caused shipments to be rejected and have put a premium on non-GM soy.[tpl]cite news|url=|title= EU Caught in Quandary Over GMO Animal Feed Imports |newspaper=The Guardian|date= December 7, 2007[/tpl]
A 2006 United States Department of Agriculture report found the adoption of genetically engineered (GE) soy, corn and cotton reduced the amount of pesticides used overall, but did result in a slightly greater amount of herbicides used for soy specifically. The use of GE soy was also associated with greater conservation tillage, indirectly leading to better soil conservation, as well as increased income from off-farming sources due to the greater ease with which the crops can be managed. Though the overall estimated benefits of the adoption of GE soybeans in the United States was $310 million, the majority of this benefit was experienced by the companies selling the seeds (40%), followed by biotechnology firms (28%) and farmers (20%).[tpl]cite web| publisher = United States Department of Agriculture|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/eib11/eib11.pdf | format = PDF|title = The First Decade of Genetically Engineered Crops in the United States |last = Fernandez-Cornejo | first = J. | coauthors = Caswell, Margriet|date = April 1, 2006| accessdate =February 18, 2012[/tpl]

==Uses==

Approximately 85% of the world's soybean crop is processed into soybean meal and vegetable oil.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soyatech.com/canola_facts.htm|title=Canola Oil|publisher=Soyatech|accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl] Soybeans can be broadly classified as "vegetable" (garden) or field (oil) types. Vegetable types cook more easily, have a mild, nutty flavor, better texture, are larger in size, higher in protein, and lower in oil than field types. Tofu and soy milk producers prefer the higher protein cultivars bred from vegetable soybeans originally brought to the United States in the late 1930s. The "garden" cultivars are generally not suitable for mechanical combine harvesting because there is a tendency for the pods to shatter upon reaching maturity.
Among the legumes, the soybean, also classed as an oilseed, is preeminent for its high (38–45%) protein content as well as its high (approximately 20%) oil content. Soybeans are the second-most valuable agricultural export in the United States behind corn. The bulk of the soybean crop is grown for oil production, with the high-protein defatted and "toasted" soy meal used as livestock feed. A smaller percentage of soybeans are used directly for human consumption.
Immature soybeans may be boiled whole in their green pods and served with salt, under the Japanese name [tpl]Nihongo|edamame|枝豆|edamame[/tpl]. In English, these soybeans are generally known as "edamame" or "green vegetable soybeans".
In China, Japan, and Korea, the bean and products made from it are a popular part of the diet. The Chinese invented tofu (豆腐 dòufu),[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] and also made use of several varieties of soybean paste as seasonings. Japanese foods made from soya include miso (味噌), nattō (納豆), kinako (黄粉) and edamame (枝豆). Also many kinds of food are produced using tofu such as atsuage, aburaage, and so on. In Korean cuisine, soybean sprouts, called kongnamul (콩나물), are also used in a variety of dishes, and are also the base ingredient in doenjang, cheonggukjang and ganjang. In Vietnam, soybeans are used to make soybean paste- tương in the North with the most popular products are tương Bần, tương Nam Đàn, tương Cự Đà as a garnish for phở and gỏi cuốn dishes, tofu (đậu hũ or đậu phụ or tàu hũ), soya sauce (nước tương, literally: soya water), soya milk (nước đậu in the North or sữa đậu nành in the South), and đậu hũ nước đường (tofu sweet soup).
The beans can be processed in a variety of ways. Common forms of soy (or soya) include soy meal, soy flour, soy milk, tofu, textured vegetable protein (TVP, which is made into a wide variety of vegetarian foods, some of them intended to imitate meat), tempeh, soy lecithin and soybean oil. Soybeans are also the primary ingredient involved in the production of soy sauce (shoyu).
Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is among the largest processors of soybeans and soy products. ADM, along with Dow Chemical Company, DuPont and Monsanto Company, support the industry trade associations United Soybean Board and Soyfoods Association of North America. These trade associations have increased the consumption of soy products dramatically in recent years.

===Oil===

Soybean seed contains about 19% oil. To extract soybean oil from seed, the soybeans are cracked, adjusted for moisture content, rolled into flakes and solvent-extracted with commercial hexane. The oil is then refined, blended for different applications, and sometimes hydrogenated. Soybean oils, both liquid and partially hydrogenated, are exported abroad, sold as "vegetable oil", or end up in a wide variety of processed foods. The remaining soybean meal is used mainly as animal feed.[tpl]cite journal|first=Edmund W.|last=Lusas|first2=Mian N.|last2=Riaz|year=1995|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/125/3_Suppl/573S.full.pdf|format=PDF|title=Soy Protein Products: Processing and Use|journal=Journal of Nutrition|issue=125|pages=573S–580S[/tpl]

===Meal===

Soybean meal is the material remaining after solvent extraction of oil from soybean flakes, with a 50% soy protein content. The meal is 'toasted' (a misnomer because the heat treatment is with moist steam) and ground in a hammer mill. Soybean meal is an essential element of the American production method of growing farm animals, such as poultry and swine, on an industrial scale that began in the 1930s; and more recently the aquaculture of catfish. Ninety-eight percent of the U.S. soybean crop is used for livestock feed. Soybean meal is also used in lower-end dog foods.

===Flour===

Soy flour refers to soybeans ground finely enough to pass through a 100-mesh or smaller screen where special care was taken during desolventizing (not toasted) to minimize denaturation of the protein to retain a high protein dispersibility index, for uses such as food extrusion of textured vegetable protein. It is the starting material for production of soy concentrate and soy protein isolate.
Soy flour is made by roasting the soybean, removing the coat, and grinding into a flour. Soy flour is manufactured with different fat levels.[tpl]sfn|Lim|2012|p=637[/tpl]  Alternatively, raw soy flour omits the roasting step.
Soy lecithin can be added (up to 15%) to soy flour to make lecithinated soy flour. It increases dispersibility and gives it emulsifying properties.[tpl]sfn|Lim|2012|p=637[/tpl]
Soy flour has 50% protein and 5% fiber. It has higher levels of protein, thiamine, riboflavin, phosphorus, calcium, and iron than wheat flour. It does not contain gluten.[tpl]sfn|Lim|2012|p=637[/tpl] As a result, yeast-raised breads made with soy flour are dense in texture. Among many uses, soy flour thickens sauces, prevents staling in baked food, and reduces oil absorption during frying. Baking food with soy flour gives it tenderness, moistness, a rich color, and a fine texture.[tpl]sfn|Lim|2012|p=637[/tpl]
Soy grits are similar to soy flour except the soybeans have been toasted and cracked into coarse pieces.
Kinako is a soy flour used in Japanese cuisine.

===Infant formula===

Soy-based infant formula (SBIF) is sometimes given to infants who are not being strictly breastfed; it can be useful for infants who are either allergic to pasteurized cow milk proteins or who are being fed a vegan diet. It is sold in powdered, ready-to-feed, and concentrated liquid forms.
Some reviews have expressed the opinion that more research is needed to determine what effect the phytoestrogens in soybeans may have on infants.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=14599051 |year=2003 |last1=Miniello |first1=VL |last2=Moro |first2=GE |last3=Tarantino |first3=M |last4=Natile |first4=M |last5=Granieri |first5=L |last6=Armenio |first6=L |title=Soy-based Formulas and Phyto-oestrogens: A Safety Profile |volume=91 |issue=441 |pages=93–100 |journal=Acta Paediatrica|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell[/tpl] Diverse studies have concluded there are no adverse effects in human growth, development, or reproduction as a result of the consumption of soy-based infant formula.[tpl]cite journal |pages=191–196 |doi=10.1515/JPEM.2004.17.2.191 |title=Soy Protein Formulas in Children: No Hormonal Effects in Long-term Feeding |year=2004 |last1=Giampietro |first1=P.G. |last2=Bruno |first2=G. |last3=Furcolo |first3=G. |last4=Casati |first4=A. |last5=Brunetti |first5=E. |last6=Spadoni |first6=G.L. |last7=Galli |first7=E. |journal=Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=17 |issue=2 |pmid=15055353|publisher=Freund Publishing House[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pages=807–814 |doi=10.1001/jama.286.7.807 |title=Exposure to Soy-Based Formula in Infancy and Endocrinological and Reproductive Outcomes in Young Adulthood |year=2001 |last1=Strom |first1=B.

 ... no clinical concerns with respect to nutritional adequacy, sexual development, neurobehavioral development, immune development, or thyroid disease. SBIFs provide complete nutrition that adequately supports normal infant growth and development. FDA has accepted SBIFs as safe for use as the sole source of nutrition. 

===Meat and dairy alternatives and extenders===

Soybeans can be processed to produce a texture and appearance similar to many other foods. For example, soybeans are the primary ingredient in many dairy product substitutes (e.g., soy milk, margarine, soy ice cream, soy yogurt, soy cheese, and soy cream cheese) and meat alternatives (e.g. veggie burgers). These substitutes are readily available in most supermarkets. Soy milk does not naturally contain significant amounts of digestible calcium. Many manufacturers of soy milk sell calcium-enriched products, as well. Soy is also used in tempeh: the beans (sometimes mixed with grain) are fermented into a solid cake.
Soy products also are used as a low-cost substitute in meat and poultry products.[tpl]cite book |author=Hoogenkamp, Henk W. |title=Soy Protein and Formulated Meat Products |publisher=CABI Publishing |location=Wallingford, Oxon, UK |year=2005 |page=14 |isbn=0-85199-864-X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=IRIRBOd_oTcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=soy+protein#v=snippet&q=substiture&f=false |accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Endres|first=Joseph G.|title=Soy Protein Products |publisher=AOCS Publishing |location=Champaign-Urbana, IL |year=2001 |pages=43–44 |isbn=1-893997-27-8 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=3RNa1vS0sZYC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=Soy+Protein+Products++endres#v=onepage&q=Soy%20Protein%20Products%20%20endres&f=false |accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl] Food service, retail and institutional (primarily school lunch and correctional) facilities regularly use such "extended" products. Extension may result in diminished flavor, but fat and cholesterol are reduced. Vitamin and mineral fortification can be used to make soy products nutritionally equivalent to animal protein; the protein quality is already roughly equivalent.

===Other products===

Soybeans with black hulls are used in Chinese fermented black beans, douchi, not to be confused with black turtle beans.
Soybeans are also used in industrial products, including oils, soap, cosmetics, resins, plastics, inks, crayons, solvents, and clothing. Soybean oil is the primary source of biodiesel in the United States, accounting for 80% of domestic biodiesel production.[tpl]cite web|title=Sustainability Fact Sheet|publisher=National Biodiesel Board|date= April 2008|url=http://biodiesel.org/resources/sustainability/pdfs/SustainabilityFactSheet.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl] Soybeans have also been used since 2001 as fermenting stock in the manufacture of a brand of vodka.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.martinimuse.com/vodka_brands_and_types.shtml|title=How Vodka is Made|publisher=Martini Muse|accessdate=February 18, 2012[/tpl] In 1936, Ford Motor Company developed a method where soybeans and fibers were rolled together producing a soup which was then pressed into various parts for their cars, from the distributor cap to knobs on the dash board.

===Cattle feed===

Cattle are often fed soy. Spring grasses are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, whereas soy is predominantly omega-6.

==Health benefits==

===Lunasin===

Lunasin is a peptide found in soy and some cereal grains and has been the subject of research since 1996 focusing on cancer, cholesterol and cardiovascular disease and inflammation.

===Cancer===

According to the American Cancer Society, "Studies in humans have not shown harm from eating soy foods. Moderate consumption of soy foods appears safe for both breast cancer survivors and the general population, and may even lower breast cancer risk." They caution however that soy supplements should be avoided.

===Brain===

Recent studies have shown improvement in postmenopausal women's cognitive function, particularly verbal memory,[tpl]cite journal |pmid=12792289 |date=May–June 2003 |last1=Kritz-Silverstein |first1=D |last2=Von Mühlen |first2=D |last3=Barrett-Connor |first3=E |last4=Bressel |first4=MA |title=Isoflavones and Cognitive Function in Older Women: The Soy and Postmenopausal Health in Aging (SOPHIA) Study |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=196–202 |journal=Menopause|publisher=The North American Menopause Society |doi=10.1097/00042192-200310030-00004[/tpl] and in frontal lobe function[tpl]cite journal |pmid=15772567 |date=March 2005 |last1=File |first1=S.

===Alpha-linolenic acid===

Soybean oil is one of the vegetable oils that contain a significant amount of the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n−3, aLNA). Other plant oils containing aLNA (or ALA) include canola, walnut, hemp, and flax. Soybean oil has an omega-3:omega-6 ratio of 1:7. This is a significantly higher omega-3 content than in other vegetable cooking oils. While flaxseed is even higher with a ratio of 3:1, it is not practical for cooking. For more information on the health benefits of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, see Essential fatty acids.

===Natural phenols===

====Isoflavones====

Soybeans also contain the isoflavones genistein and daidzein, types of phytoestrogen, that are considered by some dietitians and physicians to be useful in the prevention of cancer and by others to be carcinogenic[tpl]cite journal |date=February 21, 2006|pages=1034–1044 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.171052 |title=Soy Protein, Isoflavones, and Cardiovascular Health: An American Heart Association Science Advisory for Professionals from the Nutrition Committee|last1=Sacks |first1=F.

Soy's content of isoflavones are as much as 3 mg/g dry weight.[tpl]cite web|url=http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/soybean/uses_isoflavones.htm|title=Soy Isoflavones|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=February 19, 2012[/tpl] Isoflavones are polyphenol compounds, produced primarily by beans and other legumes, including peanuts and chickpeas. Isoflavones are closely related to the antioxidant flavonoids found in other plants, vegetables and flowers. Isoflavones such as genistein and daidzein are found in only some plant families, because most plants do not have an enzyme, chalcone isomerase which converts a flavone precursor into an isoflavone.
In contradiction to well known benefits of isoflavones, genistein acts as an oxidant (stimulating nitrate synthesis),[tpl]cite journal |pages=607–616 |doi=10.1079/BJN2003820 |title=Effect of Genistein and Daidzein on Platelet Aggregation and Monocyte and Endothelial Function |date=May 2003 |last1=Gottstein |first1=Nicole |last2=Ewins |first2=Benjamin A. |last3=Eccleston |first3=Clair |last4=Hubbard |first4=Gary P. |last5=Kavanagh |first5=Ian C. |last6=Minihane |first6=Anne-Marie |last7=Weinberg |first7=Peter D. |last8=Rimbach |first8=Gerald |journal=British Journal of Nutrition|publisher=The Nutrition Society |volume=89 |issue=5 |pmid=12720581[/tpl] and blocks formation of new blood vessels (antiangiogenic effect).[tpl]cite journal |pages=389–393 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2004.03.045 |title=Antiproliferative and Antiangiogenic Activities of Genistein in Human Renal Cell Carcinoma |date=August 2004 |last1=Sasamura |first1=Hiroto |last2=Takahashi |first2=Atsushi |last3=Yuan |first3=Jinyang |last4=Kitamura |first4=Hiroshi |last5=Masumori |first5=Naoya |last6=Miyao |first6=Noriomi |last7=Itoh |first7=Naoki |last8=Tsukamoto |first8=Taiji |journal=Urology|publisher=American Urological Association |volume=64 |issue=2 |pmid=15302513[/tpl] Some studies show that genistein acts as inhibitor of substances that regulate cell division and cell survival (growth factors).

===Cholesterol and heart diseases===

The dramatic increase in soyfood sales is largely credited to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval of soy as an official cholesterol-lowering food, along with other heart and health benefits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/outreach/labels.html|publisher=Cornell University Food and Brand Lab|title=How do Front & Back Package Labels Influence Beliefs About Health Claims?|accessdate=February 19, 2012[/tpl] A 2001 literature review argued that these health benefits were poorly supported by the available evidence, and noted that disturbing data on soy's effect on the cognitive function of the elderly existed.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=11522120|year=2001 |last1=Sirtori |first1=C.

In 1995, the New England Journal of Medicine (Vol. 333, No. 5) published "Meta-analysis of the effects of soy protein intake on serum lipids",[tpl]cite journal |pages=276–282 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199508033330502 |title=Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Soy Protein Intake on Serum Lipids |year=1995 |last1=Anderson |first1=James W. |last2=Johnstone |first2=Bryan M. |last3=Cook-Newell |first3=Margaret E. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine|publisher=Massachusetts Medical Society |volume=333 |issue=5 |pmid=7596371[/tpl] financed in part by DuPont Protein Technologies International (PTI), which produces and markets soy through The Solae Company (see external links). The meta-analysis concluded that soy protein is correlated with significant decreases in serum cholesterol, LDL (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides. However, HDL (good cholesterol) did not increase by a significant amount. Soy phytoestrogens (isoflavones: genistein and daidzein) adsorbed onto the soy protein were suggested as the agent reducing serum cholesterol levels. On the basis of this research PTI filed a petition with FDA in 1998 for a health claim that soy protein may reduce cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.
The FDA granted the following health claim for soy: "25 grams of soy protein a day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease." One serving, (1 cup or 240 mL) of soy milk, for instance, contains 6 or 7 grams of soy protein. Solae resubmitted their original petition, asking for a more vague health claim, after their original was challenged and highly criticized. Solae also submitted a petition for a health claim that soy can help prevent cancer. They quickly withdrew the petition for lack of evidence and after more than 1,000 letters of protest were received. On February 18, 2008 Weston A. Price Foundation submitted a petition for removal of this health claim.[tpl]cite web |url=http://westonaprice.org/soy/FDASoyHeartLetterFinal.pdf |format=PDF|title=RE: Docket No. 2007N0-464|publisher=Weston A. Price Foundation |accessdate=February 19, 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] 25 g/day soy protein was established as the threshold intake because most trials used at least this much protein and not because less than this amount is inefficacious. In fact, there is evidence suggesting that lower amounts are indeed efficacious.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=12620535 |date=March 2003 |last1=Messina |first1=M.

An American Heart Association review of a decade long study of soy protein benefits casts doubt on the FDA allowed "Heart Healthy" claim for soy protein and does not recommend isoflavone supplementation. The review panel also found that soy isoflavones have not been shown to reduce post menopause "hot flashes" in women and the efficacy and safety of isoflavones to help prevent cancers of the breast, uterus or prostate is in question. However, AHA concludes that "many soy products should be beneficial to cardiovascular and overall health because of their high content of polyunsaturated fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals and low content of saturated fat".
Importantly, however, the AHA did not conduct a formal statistical analysis of the 22 studies upon which they based their estimate of the potency of soy protein. When such an analysis was conducted, Jenkins et al.[tpl]cite journal |first1=David J. A. |last1=Jenkins |first2=Arash |last2=Mirrahimi |first3=Korbua |last3=Srichaikul |first4=Claire E. |last4=Berryman |first5=Li |last5=Wang |first6=Amanda |last6=Carleton |first7=Shahad |last7=Abdulnour |first8=John L. |last8=Sievenpiper |first9=Cyril W.

Further, when the analysis was limited to the 11 studies that provided evidence that the control and soy diets were matched, soy protein was found to lower LDL by 5.2 percent. This estimate is in line with the results of other recently published meta-analyses.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Siyan |last1=Zhan |first2=Suzanne C. |last2=Ho |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|publisher=American Society for Nutrition |pmid=15699227 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15699227 |date=December 2005 |title=Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Soy Protein Containing Isoflavones on the Lipid Profile |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=397–408[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pmid=18534601 |date=September 2008 |last1=Harland |first1=J.

==Health risks==

===Allergy===

Allergy to soy is common, and the food is listed with other foods that commonly cause allergy, such as milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish. The problem has been reported among younger children, and the diagnosis of soy allergy is often based on symptoms reported by parents and results of skin tests or blood tests for allergy. Only a few reported studies have attempted to confirm allergy to soy by direct challenge with the food under controlled conditions.[tpl]cite journal |last = Cantani | first = A. | coauthor = Lucenti P.| date = August 1997 | title = Natural History of Soy Allergy and/or Intolerance in Children, and Clinical Use of Soy-protein Formulas | journal = Pediatric Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|publisher=Wiley Online Library| volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 59–74 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3038.1997.tb00146.x | pmid = 9617775 [/tpl] It is very difficult to give a reliable estimate of the true prevalence of soy allergy in the general population. To the extent that it does exist, soy allergy may cause cases of urticaria and angioedema, usually within minutes to hours of ingestion. In rare cases, true anaphylaxis may also occur. The reason for the discrepancy is likely that soy proteins, the causative factor in allergy, are far less potent at triggering allergy symptoms than the proteins of peanut and shellfish.[tpl]cite journal | last = Cordle | first = C. T. | date = May 2004 | title = Soy Protein Allergy: Incidence and Relative Severity | journal = Journal of Nutrition|publisher=The American Society for Nutritional Sciences | volume = 134 | issue = 5 | pages = 1213S–1219S | pmid = 15113974 [/tpl] An allergy test that is positive demonstrates that the immune system has formed IgE antibodies to soy proteins. However, this is only a factor when soy proteins reach the blood without being digested, in sufficient quantities to reach a threshold to provoke actual symptoms.
Soy can also trigger symptoms via food intolerance, a situation where no allergic mechanism can be proven. One scenario is seen in very young infants who have vomiting and diarrhoea when fed soy-based formula, which resolves when the formula is withdrawn. Older infants can suffer a more severe disorder with vomiting, diarrhoea that may be bloody, anemia, weight loss and failure to thrive. The most common cause of this unusual disorder is a sensitivity to cow's milk, but soy formulas can also be the trigger. The precise mechanism is unclear and it could be immunologic, although not through the IgE-type antibodies that have the leading role in urticaria and anaphylaxis. However it is also self-limiting and will often disappear in the toddler years.[tpl]cite journal | last = Sampson | first = H.

===Phytoestrogen===

Soybeans contain isoflavones called genistein and daidzein, which are one source of phytoestrogens in the human diet. Because most naturally occurring estrogenic substances show weak activity, normal consumption of foods that contain these phytoestrogens should not provide sufficient amounts to elicit a physiological response in humans.[tpl]cite journal |pages=613–618 |doi=10.1042/CS20000212 |title=Effect of a Phytoestrogen Food Supplement on Reproductive Health in Normal Males |date=June 2001 |last1=Mitchell |first1=Julie H. |last2=Cawood |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Kinniburgh |first3=David |last4=Provan |first4=Anne |last5=Collins |first5=Andrew R. |last6=Irvine |first6=D.

Plant lignans associated with high fiber foods such as cereal brans and beans are the principal precursor to mammalian lignans which have an ability to bind to human estrogen sites.

====Women====

A 2001 literature review suggested that women with current or past breast cancer should be aware of the risks of potential tumor growth when taking soy products, based on the effect of phytoestrogens to promote breast cancer cell growth in animals.[tpl]cite journal |pages=1118–1121 |doi=10.1345/aph.10257 |title=Effects of Soy Phytoestrogens Genistein and Daidzein on Breast Cancer Growth |date=September 2001 |last1=De Lemos |first1=Mário L |journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy |publisher=Harvey Whitney Books|volume=35|issue=9 |pmid=11573864[/tpl] A 2006 commentary reviewed the relationship with soy and breast cancer.

====Men====

Because of the phytoestrogen content, some studies have suggested that soybean ingestion may influence testosterone levels in men. However, a 2010 meta-analysis of 15 placebo controlled studies showed that neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable testosterone or estrogen concentrations in men.[tpl]cite journal |pages=997–1007 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.04.038 |title=Clinical studies show no effects of soy protein or isoflavones on reproductive hormones in men: Results of a meta-analysis |year=2010 |last1=Hamilton-Reeves |first1=Jill M. |last2=Vazquez |first2=Gabriela |last3=Duval |first3=Sue J. |last4=Phipps |first4=William R. |last5=Kurzer |first5=Mindy S. |last6=Messina |first6=Mark J. |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=94 |issue=3 |pmid=19524224[/tpl] It has been hypothesized that soy foods and enterolactone may increase the development of prostate cancer although no significant associations were observed for the soy isoflavones.[tpl]cite journal |pages=388–96 |doi=10.1017/S0007114507700703 |title=Phyto-oestrogens and risk of prostate cancer in Scottish men |year=2007 |last1=Heald |first1=C.

===Brain===

Though there is some evidence that estrogen can help protect and repair the brain after injury in rats,[tpl]cite journal|coauthors=Burguete M. C., Torregrosa G., Pérez-Asensio F. J., Castelló-Ruiz M., Salom J.B., Gil J. V., Alborch E.|title=Dietary Phytoestrogens Improve Stroke Outcome After Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Rats|journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|publisher=European Neuroscience Association|volume=23|issue=3|pages=703–710|date=February 2006|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16487152|pmid=16487152|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.04599.x|author=Burguete MC, Torregrosa G, Pérez-Asensio FJ, et al.[/tpl] there is also evidence that phytoestrogens may be harmful for the recovery of rats in other situations[tpl]cite journal |pages=135–138 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3940(02)01391-5 |title=Soya Phytoestrogens Change Cortical and Hippocampal Expression of BDNF mRNA in Male Rats |date=February 2003 |last1=File |first1=Sandra E. |last2=Hartley |first2=David E. |last3=Alom |first3=Nazmul |last4=Rattray |first4=Marcus |journal=Neuroscience Letters|publisher=Elsevier |volume=338 |issue=2 |pmid=12566171[/tpl] that have sustained brain injury.
Similarly, epidemiological evidence of humans eating soya products is currently divided: a study of Japanese men between 1965 and 1999 demonstrated a positive correlation between brain atrophy and consumption of tofu meals,[tpl]cite journal |first1=Lon R. |last1=White |first2=Webster |last2=Petrovitch |last3=Ross |first4=Kamal |last4=Masaki |first5=John |last5=Hardman |first6=James |last6=Nelson |first7=Daron |last7=Davis |first8=William |last8=Markesbery |title=Brain Aging and Midlife Tofu Consumption |journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition|publisher=American College of Nutrition |pmid=10763906 |url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10763906 |date=April 2000 |first3=GW |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=242–255 |doi=10.1080/07315724.2000.10718923[/tpl] and a study on elderly Indonesian men and women found that high tofu intake was associated with poorer memory, but the consumption of tempeh was associated with better memory.
So it may be that the type of soya bean used, or its preparation or additional ingredients are relevant factors, there is not yet definitive evidence known.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Song|first1= W.

However, the soy isoflavone genistein has been suggested as a chemopreventive agent against pancreatic cancer, by interfering with the chemical pathways that promote the creation and growth of tumors.[tpl]cite journal |pages=326–336 |doi=10.1016/j.taap.2006.11.007 |title=Pancreatic Cancer: Pathogenesis, Prevention and Treatment |date=November 2007 |last1=Sarkar |first1=F. |last2=Banerjee |first2=S. |last3=Li |first3=Y. |journal=Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology |publisher=Academic Press|volume=224 |issue=3 |pmid=17174370 |pmc=2094388[/tpl]
The Cancer Council of New South Wales, Australia has released a statement saying scientific research suggests that overall the moderate consumption of soy products does not appear to present a risk to women with breast cancer, and there is equivocal evidence that consuming large amounts of soy products may have a protective effect against developing breast and prostate cancer. However, the Council does not recommend taking soy dietary supplements as there is no evidence they are either effective or safe at preventing or treating cancers.

===Gout===

Soybeans and soy products contain significant amounts of purines, a class of organic compounds. For people who suffer from gout, eating foods containing moderate or high levels of purines might make the condition worse. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends that gout sufferers limit consumption of soy products (although also suggesting that soy may have health benefits by reducing the risk for heart disease).[ref]
</ref> However, other researchers have found little or no association between consumption of purine-rich vegetables (including beans) and gout.<ref>
