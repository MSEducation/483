==Formal definition==

A knot is an embedding of the circle (S1) into three-dimensional Euclidean space (E3).[tpl]cite book |last=Armstrong |first=M. A.| year=1983 |origyear=1979 |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag |series=Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics |title=Basic Topology |isbn=0-387-90839-0 |page=213 |ref=harv[/tpl] Two knots are defined to be equivalent if there is an ambient isotopy between them.[tpl]citation needed|reason=Armstrong uses a looser equivalence on p. 214, only requiring an ambient homeomorphism. He then goes on to discuss why it would be a good idea to restrict this to ambient isotopy. I know this latter definition is standard, but I Armstrong doesn't directly support that and I don't have a citation handy|date=December 2011[/tpl]

===Tame vs. wild knots===

A polygonal knot is a knot whose image in E3 is the union of a finite set of line segments.Armstrong (1983), p.215. A tame knot is any knot equivalent to a polygonal knot. Knots which are not tame are called wild.[tpl]mathworld |title=Wild Knot |id=WildKnot[/tpl]

==Types of knots==

The simplest knot, called the unknot or trivial knot, is a round circle embedded in R3. In the ordinary sense of the word, the unknot is not "knotted" at all. The simplest nontrivial knots are the trefoil knot (31 in the table), the figure-eight knot (41) and the cinquefoil knot (51).
Several knots, linked or tangled together, are called links. Knots are links with a single component.
Often mathematicians prefer to consider knots embedded into the 3-sphere, S3, rather than R3 since the 3-sphere is compact. The 3-sphere is equivalent to R3 with a single point added at infinity (see one-point compactification).
Given a knot in the 3-sphere, the knot complement is all the points of the 3-sphere not contained in the knot. A major theorem of Gordon and Luecke states that at most two knots have homeomorphic complements (the original knot and its mirror reflection). This in effect turns the study of knots into the study of their complements, and in turn into 3-manifold theory.

==Generalization==

Haefliger based his work on Smale's h-cobordism theorem. One of Smale's theorems is that when one deals with knots in co-dimension greater than two, even inequivalent knots have diffeomorphic complements. This gives the subject a different flavour than co-dimension 2 knot theory. If one allows topological or PL-isotopies, Zeeman proved that spheres do not knot when the co-dimension is larger than two. See a generalization to manifolds.
