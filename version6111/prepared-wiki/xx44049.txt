[[Route inspection problem]]

CATEGORIES: NP-complete problems, Computational problems in graph theory

In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, the Chinese postman problem (CPP), postman tour  or route inspection problem is to find a shortest closed path or circuit that visits every edge of a (connected) undirected graph. When the graph has an Eulerian circuit (a closed walk that covers every edge once), that circuit is an optimal solution.
Alan Goldman of the U.S. National Bureau of Standards first coined the name 'Chinese Postman Problem' for this problem, as it was originally studied by the Chinese mathematician Kwan Mei-Ko in 1962.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/chinesePostman.html | title="Chinese Postman Problem"[/tpl]

==Eulerian paths and circuits==

In order for a graph to have an Eulerian circuit, it will certainly have to be connected. 
Suppose we have a connected graph G = (V, E),  The following statements are equivalent:
An Eulerian path (a walk which is not closed but uses all edges of G just once) exists if and only if G is connected and exactly two vertices have odd valence.

==T-joins==

==Solution==

If a graph has an Eulerian circuit (or an Eulerian path), then an Eulerian circuit (or path) visits every edge, and so the solution is to choose any Eulerian circuit (or path).
If the graph is not Eulerian, it must contain vertices of odd degree. By the handshaking lemma, there must be an even number of these vertices. To solve the postman problem we first find a smallest T-join. We make the graph Eulerian by doubling of the T-join.  The solution to the postman problem in the original graph is obtained by finding an Eulerian circuit for the new graph.

==Applications==

Various combinatorial problems are reduced to the Chinese Postman Problem, including finding a maximum cut in a planar graph 
and a minimum-mean length circuit in an undirected graph A. Schrijver, Combinatorial Optimization, Polyhedra and Efficiency, Volume A, Springer. (2002).

==Variants==

A few variants of the Chinese Postman Problem have been studied and shown to be NP-complete.
