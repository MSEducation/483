==Faculty appointment==

After receiving his Ph.D. in economics from Yale in 1950, Eggers became an assistant professor in the economics department at Syracuse University, where he subsequently became department chair (1960)[tpl]cite journal | journal = The American Economic Review | year = 1960 | volume = 50 | number = 3 | page = 550[/tpl] and full professor (1963).[tpl]cite journal | journal = The American Economic Review | year = 1963 | volume = 53 | number = 4 | page = 891[/tpl]

Eggers was later appointed provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs before being appointed chancellor in 1971, when the previous chancellor, John E. Corbally, left Syracuse to lead the University of Illinois system.[tpl]cite book|last=Greene|first=John Robert|title=Syracuse University: The Eggers Years|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse|year=1998|isbn=0-8156-0549-8[/tpl] 
Eggers took office in the midst of student demonstrations and strikes, primarily focused on ending the Vietnam War. Eggers is widely seen as having strengthened Syracuse academically over his two decades as chancellor. During his tenure, the university upgraded many of its academic programs, its enrollment increased substantially, and many new buildings were opened, including the Carrier Dome. Eggers also guided the university community through the trauma of the December 21, 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 35 students who were returning from a semester of study at Syracuse's London campus. 
Eggers retired as chancellor in 1991.
