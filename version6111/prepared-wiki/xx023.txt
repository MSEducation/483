BeOS is an operating system for personal computers first developed by Be Inc. in 1991. It was first written to run on BeBox hardware. BeOS was built for digital media work and was written to take advantage of modern hardware facilities such as symmetric multiprocessing by utilizing modular I/O bandwidth, pervasive multithreading, preemptive multitasking and a 64-bit journaling file system known as BFS. The BeOS GUI was developed on the principles of clarity and a clean, uncluttered design.
BeOS was positioned as a multimedia platform which could be used by a substantial population of desktop users and a competitor to Mac OS and Microsoft Windows. However, it was ultimately unable to achieve a significant market share and proved commercially unviable for Be Inc. The company was acquired by Palm Inc. and today BeOS is mainly used and developed by a small population of enthusiasts.
The open-source OS Haiku, a complete reimplementation of BeOS, is designed to start up where BeOS left off. Alpha 4 of Haiku was released in November 2012.[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.haiku-os.org/news/2012-11-12_haiku_release_1_alpha_4 |title=Haiku Release 1 Alpha 4 |date=November 12, 2012 |work=Haiku-OS.org [/tpl].

==Design==

BeOS was optimized for digital media work and was written to take advantage of modern computer hardware facilities such as symmetric multiprocessing by utilizing modular I/O bandwidth, pervasive multithreading, preemptive multitasking and a 64-bit journaling file system known as BFS. The BeOS GUI was developed on the principles of clarity and a clean, uncluttered design.
The API was written in C++ for ease of programming. It has partial POSIX compatibility and access to a command-line interface through Bash, although internally it is not a Unix-derived operating system.
BeOS used Unicode as the default encoding in the GUI, though support for input methods such as bidirectional text input was never realized.

==History==

Initially designed to run on AT&T Hobbit-based hardware, BeOS was later modified to run on PowerPC-based processors: first Be's own systems, later Apple Inc.'s PowerPC Reference Platform and Common Hardware Reference Platform, with the hope that Apple would purchase or license BeOS as a replacement for its aging Mac OS.[tpl]cite web | url=http://macreate.net/reloaded/?q=node/view/149  | title=BeOS @ MaCreate | date=2004-11-24 | author=Tom | accessdate=2006-11-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050324220739/http://macreate.net/reloaded/?q=node/view/149 |archivedate = 2005-03-24[/tpl] Apple CEO Gil Amelio started negotiations to buy Be Inc., but negotiations stalled when Be CEO Jean-Louis Gassée wanted $200 million; Apple was unwilling to offer any more than $125 million. Apple's board of directors decided NeXTSTEP was a better choice and purchased NeXT in 1996 for $429 million, bringing back Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://macspeedzone.com/archive/art/con/be.shtml |title=Apple Confidential: The Day They Almost Decided To Put Windows NT On The Mac Instead Of OS X! |author=Owen W.

In 1997, Power Computing began bundling BeOS (on a CD for optional installation) with its line of PowerPC-based Macintosh clones. These systems could dual boot either the Mac OS or BeOS, with a start-up screen offering the choice.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue1-36.html |title=Be Newsletters, Volume 1: 1995-1996 |author= |year=1996 |website=HaikuOS |publisher=Be Inc. |accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl]
Due to Apple's moves and the mounting debt of Be Inc., BeOS was soon ported to the Intel x86 platform with its R3 release in March 1998.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue3-24.html |title=Be Newsletters, Volume 3: 1998 |author= |year=1998 |website=Haiku OS |publisher=Be Inc. |accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl] Through the late 1990s, BeOS managed to create a niche of followers, but the company failed to remain viable.  Be Inc. also released a stripped-down, but free, copy of BeOS R5 known as BeOS Personal Edition (BeOS PE). BeOS PE could be started from within Microsoft Windows or Linux, and was intended to nurture consumer interest in its product and give developers something to tinker with.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue5-13.html |title=Be Newsletters, Volume 5: 2000 |author= |year=2000 |website=Haiku OS |publisher=Be Inc. |accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yellowbites.com/beos.html |title=BeOS/Zeta |author= |website=YellowBites |publisher=YellowBites |accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl] Be Inc. also released a stripped-down version of BeOS for Internet Appliances (BeIA), which soon became the company's business focus in place of BeOS.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue5-17.html |title=Be Newsletters, Volume 5: 2000 |author= |year=2000 |website=Haiku OS |publisher=Be Inc. |accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl]
In 2001 Be's copyrights were sold to Palm, Inc. for some $11 million. BeOS R5 is considered the last official version, but BeOS R5.1 "Dano", which was under development before Be's sale to Palm and included the BeOS Networking Environment (BONE) networking stack, was leaked to the public shortly after the company's demise.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/benewsletter/Issue5-5.html |title=Be Newsletters, Volume 5 : 2000 |author= |year=2000 |website=Haiku OS |publisher=Be Inc |accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.osnews.com/story/552/More-Information-on-the-BeOS-Dano-Version |title=More Information on the BeOS Dano Version |author=Jake Daniels |date=23 January 2001 |website=OSNews |publisher=OSNews |accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl]
In 2002, Be Inc. sued Microsoft claiming that Hitachi had been dissuaded from selling PCs loaded with BeOS, and that Compaq had been pressured not to market an Internet appliance in partnership with Be. Be also claimed that Microsoft acted to artificially depress Be Inc.'s initial public offering (IPO).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/02/20/be_inc_sues_microsoft/ | title=Be Inc. sues Microsoft | date=2002-02-20 | author=Andrew Orlowski| accessdate=2008-04-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080420193929/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/02/20/be_inc_sues_microsoft/| archivedate= 20 April 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The case was eventually settled out of court for $23.25 million with no admission of liability on Microsoft's part.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/print.php/3073811/ | title=Microsoft Settles Anti-Trust Charges with Be | date=2003-09-08 | author=Mark Berniker| accessdate=2008-04-24[/tpl]
After the split from Palm, PalmSource used parts of BeOS's multimedia framework for its failed Palm OS Cobalt product.PalmSource Introduces Palm OS Cobalt, PalmSource press release, 10 February 2004. With the takeover of PalmSource, the BeOS rights now belong to Access Co. ACCESS Completes Acquisition of PalmSource, ACCESS press release, November 14, 2005.

===Continuation and clones===

In the years that followed the demise of Be Inc. a handful of projects formed to recreate BeOS or key elements of the OS with the eventual goal of then continuing where Be Inc. left off.  This was facilitated by the fact that Be Inc. released some components of BeOS under a free licence.  Here is a list of these projects: 
Zeta was a commercially available operating system based on the BeOS R5.1 codebase. Originally developed by yellowTAB, the operating system was then distributed by magnussoft. During development by yellowTAB, the company received criticism from the BeOS community for refusing to discuss its legal position with regard to the BeOS codebase (perhaps for contractual reasons). Access Co. (which bought PalmSource, until then the holder of the intellectual property associated with BeOS) has since declared that yellowTAB had no right to distribute a modified version of BeOS, and magnussoft has ceased distribution of the operating system.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.operating-system.org/betriebssystem/_english/bs-zeta.htm |title=Zeta Operating System |author= |date=14 October 2013 |website=Operating System.org |publisher=Operating System.org |accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl]
