William R. "Bill" Hambrecht (born 1935) is an American investment banker and chairman of WR Hambrecht + Co which he founded in 1998. He helped persuade Google to use an Internet-based auction for their initial public offering (IPO) in 2004, instead of a more traditional method using banks and other financial companies to find buyers. He is credited with popularizing this "OpenIPO" model, using Dutch auctions to allow anyone, not just investing insiders, to buy stock in an IPO, potentially raising more money for startups. Some of the companies he has helped have an IPO like this include Overstock.com, Ravenswood Winery, Andover.net and Salon.com.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/103/open_34-hambrecht.html |title=2006 Fast 50|publisher=fastcompany.com|accessdate=2007-05-30[/tpl][tpl]cite news|publisher=San Francisco Business Times |url=http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2007/05/28/daily18.html |date=2007-05-30|title=Investment banker Hambrecht plans pro football league|author=Young, Eric[/tpl]
Hambrecht is also credited as one of the first major investors to recognize the value of technology and biotech companies, helping to take Apple Computer, Genentech and Adobe Systems public in the 1980s with his earlier San Francisco-based company Hambrecht & Quist, which he founded in 1968 and which also backed the IPOs of Netscape, MP3.com, and Amazon.com. The firm was bought by Chase Manhattan in 1999.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.motherjones.com/news/special_reports/mojo_400/64_hambrecht.html?welcome=true|title= William R.
