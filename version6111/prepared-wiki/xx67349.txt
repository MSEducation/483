The Agena Target Vehicle (ATV) was an unmanned spacecraft used by NASA during its Gemini program to develop and practice orbital space rendezvous and docking techniques and to perform large orbital changes, in preparation for the Apollo program lunar missions.

==Operations==

Each ATV consisted of an Agena-D derivative upper rocket stage built by Lockheed and a docking adapter built by McDonnell. The Agena was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 14 on top of an Atlas booster built by the Convair division of General Dynamics. The Agena first burn would occur shortly after shroud jettison and separation from the Atlas over the Atlantic Ocean. Over Ascension Island, a second burn would place the Agena into a low circular orbit.
The McDonnell Gemini spacecraft would then be launched from Launch Complex 19, as soon as 90 minutes later. Both countdowns would proceed in parallel and required close synchronization. The Gemini would rendezvous and dock with the Agena as soon as Gemini's first orbit toward the end of the program.
The Gemini astronauts would then fly the combined spacecraft in a stabilized mode and perform a number of experiments:
After the Gemini capsule separated for the last time, the Agena remained in orbit for a short time and was used to verify the command system.[tpl]Clarify|date=September 2011[/tpl]
The first GATV was launched on October 25, 1965 while the Gemini 6 astronauts were waiting on the pad. While the Atlas performed normally, the Agena's engine exploded during orbital injection. Since the rendezvous and docking was the primary objective, the Gemini 6 mission was scrubbed, and replaced with the alternate mission Gemini 6A, which rendezvoused (but could not dock) with Gemini 7 in December.

==Augmented Target Docking Adapter==

On May 17, 1966, Gemini 9 astronauts Tom Stafford and Eugene Cernan were sitting on the pad awaiting the launch of their GATV. But once again, things went awry. The Atlas lifted smoothly into a cloudy sky, vanishing from view around T+50 seconds. Shortly before Booster Engine Cutoff (BECO) was supposed to occur, the guidance control officer announced that he had lost contact with the booster. Telemetry indicated that vernier and sustainer cutoff occurred at T+300 seconds and Agena staging had taken place. The Agena continued transmitting signals until T+436 seconds, when all telemetry ceased.
Meanwhile, hidden behind cloud cover, the Atlas's right booster engine gimbaled too hard right at around T+120 seconds. The launch vehicle flipped 216 degrees around and began flying back towards Cape Canaveral, and in doing so had rotated into a position where it was impossible for ground guidance to lock on. Radar stations in the Bahamas indicated that it was heading north and descending. Atlas engine cutoff and Agena staging occurred on schedule, and both vehicles plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. The cause of the failure was unclear, but telemetry indicated that a short-to-ground occurred in the circuit for the servoamplifier output command signal, possibly due to a LOX leak in the thrust section.
A backup vehicle for the ATV, known as the Augmented Target Docking Adapter (ATDA), had already been constructed by McDonnell from the docking target and the Gemini reentry attitude control thruster assembly for use if the primary ATV failed. The ATDA was designed to allow docking, but lacked the propulsion capability of the Agena rocket. This was launched on June 1, 1966, but the shroud which protected the docking adaptor during launch failed to jettison, due to lanyards being incorrectly secured using adhesive tape. Gemini 9A was launched on June 3, and when in orbit, the crew observed that the shroud of the ATDA had partially opened and was described by Stafford as "looking like an angry alligator". Docking was not possible, but the rendezvous maneuver was practised instead.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1966-047A |title=Gemini 9A |publisher=NASA |edition=Version 4.0.25 |date=August 16, 2013 |accessdate=October 30, 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=GEM9TA |title=Gemini 9 Target A |publisher=NASA |edition=Version 4.0.25 |date=August 16, 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/atlapter.htm |title=McDonnell ATDA |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica |accessdate=June 6, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1966-046A |title=Gemini 9 Target B |publisher=NASA |edition=Version 4.0.25 |date=August 16, 2013 |accessdate=October 30, 2013 [/tpl]
