[[Lusser's law]]

CATEGORIES: Failure, Reliability engineering, Survival analysis

Lusser's law, named after engineer Robert Lusser, is a prediction of reliability. It is also called the "probability product law of series components". It states that the reliability of a series system is equal to the product of the reliability of its component subsystems, if their failure modes are known to be statistically independent. This method is similar to the mathematical Multiplication principle.
