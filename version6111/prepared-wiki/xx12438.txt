</ref> for measurements of [[gamma ray]]s as well as a medium for detecting hypothetical [[weakly interacting massive particles]], or WIMPs. When a WIMP collides with a xenon nucleus, it is predicted to impart enough energy to cause ionization and [[Scintillation (physics)|scintillation]]. Liquid xenon is useful for this type of experiment due to its high density which makes dark matter interaction more likely and permits a quiet detector due to self-shielding.
Xenon is the preferred propellant for ion propulsion of spacecraft because of its low ionization potential per atomic weight, and its ability to be stored as a liquid at near room temperature (under high pressure) yet be easily converted back into a gas to feed the engine. The inert nature of xenon makes it environmentally friendly and less corrosive to an ion engine than other fuels such as mercury or caesium. Xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the 1970s.[ref]
