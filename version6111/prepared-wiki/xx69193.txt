[[Chamaesaura]]

CATEGORIES: Spinytail lizards

The Chamaesaura, also known as Grass Lizards, are a genus of legless lizards from southern and eastern Africa.  The limbs are reduced to small spikes.    The elongate shape and lack of limbs allows them to "swim" through grass.  They are viviparous and eat small invertebrates, especially grasshoppers.
