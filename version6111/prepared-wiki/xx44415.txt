Krai or kray ([tpl]lang-ru|край[/tpl]) was a type of an administrative division in the Russian Empire and the Russian SFSR,[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] and is one of the types of the federal subjects of modern Russia.
Etymologically, the word is related to the verb "[tpl]lang|ru|кроить[/tpl]" (kroit), i.e., "to cut".Etymology of the word [tpl]ru icon[/tpl] Historically, krais were vast territories located along the periphery of Russia, since the word krai also means border or edge, i.e., a place of the cut-off. In English, the term is often translated as "territory". Currently the administrative usage of the term is mostly traditional, as some oblasts also fit this description and there is no difference in legal status between the krais and the oblasts.
