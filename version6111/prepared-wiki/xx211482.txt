[[Potassium channel blocker]]

CATEGORIES: Potassium channel blockers

Potassium channel blockers are agents which interfere with conduction through potassium channels.

==Arrhythmia==

Potassium channel blockers used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia are classified as class III antiarrhythmic agents.

===Mechanism===

Class III agents predominantly block the potassium channels, thereby prolonging repolarization.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lenz TL, Hilleman DE |title=Dofetilide, a new class III antiarrhythmic agent |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=20 |issue=7 |pages=776–86 |date=July 2000 |pmid=10907968 |doi= 10.1592/phco.20.9.776.35208|url=[/tpl] More specifically, their primary effect is on IKr.[tpl]cite journal |author=Riera AR, Uchida AH, Ferreira C, et al. |title=Relationship among amiodarone, new class III antiarrhythmics, miscellaneous agents and acquired long QT syndrome |journal=Cardiol J |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=209–19 |year=2008 |pmid=18651412 |doi= |url=[/tpl] 
Since these agents do not affect the sodium channel, conduction velocity is not decreased.  The prolongation of the action potential duration and refractory period, combined with the maintenance of normal conduction velocity, prevent re-entrant arrhythmias. (The re-entrant rhythm is less likely to interact with tissue that has become refractory).
Class III antiarrhythmic agents exhibit reverse use dependent prolongation of the action potential duration (Reverse use-dependence).  This means that the refractoriness of the ventricular myocyte increases at lower heart rates.  This increases the susceptibility of the myocardium to Early Afterdepolarizations (EADs) at low heart rates.  Antiarrhythmic agents that exhibit reverse use-dependence are more efficacious at preventing a tachyarrhythmia than converting someone into normal sinus rhythm.  Because of the reverse use-dependence of class III agents, at low heart rates class III antiarrhythmic agents may paradoxically be more arrhythmogenic.

===Examples and uses===

===Side effects===

These agents include a risk of torsades de pointes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec07/ch075/ch075a.html |title=Introduction: Arrhythmias and Conduction Disorders: Merck Manual Professional |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl]

==Anti-diabetics==

Sulfonylureas come under the class of ATP-sensitive potassium channel blockers.

==Other uses==

Dalfampridine, A potassium channel blocker has also been approved for use in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Judge SI, Bever CT |title=Potassium channel blockers in multiple sclerosis: neuronal Kv channels and effects of symptomatic treatment |journal=Pharmacol.
