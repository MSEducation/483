[[Menoken Lake]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Kansas, Geography of Shawnee County, Kansas

Just outside the north city limits of Topeka, Kansas, is a [tpl]convert|12|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] lake that, according to a comment in the GoingOutside.com website, is called Menoken Lake or North Topeka Oxbow Lake.  This lake, a natural freshwater oxbow lake, is one of about six lakes that once were part of the Kansas River.  The River is a mile to the south of Menoken Lake.  When the river current shifted to the south, this lake was left behind.  The lake is about [tpl]convert|225|ft|m[/tpl] wide and about [tpl]convert|1,200|ft|m[/tpl] long.  It is curved into an arc.  This lake was once longer on both ends.  On the east end, the roadway for US 24 was filled through the lakebed.  A small patch of water still exists south of US 24.  On the west end, an entrance/exit ramp was built.  The roadbed was filled in that portion of the lakebed.  A small patch of water exists inside the loop of the ramp.GoingOutside.com website, http://www.goingoutside.com/lake/103/1035016_Silver_Lake_Kansas.html ; Wikimapia website, http://www.wikimapia.org/ ; James R. McCauley, "Development and General Geology of the Kansas River Corridor," in Kansas Geological Survey website, http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/KR/kr_geol.html .
To the south of the lake is US 24 and a frontage road is at the lake's southeast end.  Crop fields adjoin the lake along the east and south.  North 25th Street is just north of the lake and three or four residences are along the lake's edge there.  A private jetty juts into Menoken Lake from the north shore.  The west one-third of the lake has been separated from the rest by two privately owned dams.  No public swimming is allowed and there are no public boat ramps.  However, fishing can be done from the shore at the lake's east and west ends where the public road right of way adjoins the lake.Wikimapia website; GoingOutside.com website.
