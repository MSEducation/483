Geomodeling Technology Corp. produces geoscience software for the oil and gas industry. Founded in 1996, Geomodeling has international offices and resource centers in Canada, China, Mexico, Norway, United Kingdom and USA.

==History==

In 1987, Dr. Renjun Wen, Founder and Chief Technology Architect moved to Norway to pursue research interests in geostatistics and petroleum geology.http://www.geomodeling.ca/about/ As part of a post-doctorate project at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in the early 1990s, Wen developed Geomodeling's core technology, SBED. Based on his research, he was contracted by Statoil Research Centre in 1996. He worked with fault analysis from seismic attributes and provided small-scale models for remaining reserves projects. The foundation of VisualVoxAt was created during this period.
At Statoil Renjun participated in an integrated reservoir characterization study called the Remaining Reserves project. The aim of the project was to explore solutions for improving oil recovery in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea fields. The reservoir asset teams knew that part of the solution was to include the effects of small-scale heterogeneity in full-field-scale reservoir models. However, available reservoir technology was unable to model the complex interlayering in the sandstone fields.
In two months, Wen developed software that could model the cross bedding and parallel bedding structures observed in the deposits. These detailed models were used to calculate the kv/kh for the reservoir units and helped to define strategies for optimal recover.
After completing his contract in the Remaining Reserves project, Wen immigrated to Canada with his wife and two children. In Calgary, Alberta, Wen saw opportunities for taking his research to the business units of major petroleum companies. With the advent of the software and an idea, Geomodeling was born.

==Software==

The company offers three software products. These products have contributed to project sanction, well planning and improved drainage strategies in major petroleum companies.

===SBED===

SBED technology generates geological models at centimeter- to meter-scale resolution and enables more accurate calculation of hydrocarbon reserves. SBED enables the user to model the small-scale bedding structures that impact fluid distribution. With the software's built-in upscaling function, users can integrate these small-scale effects into large-scale reservoir models and decrease the uncertainty in reservoir predictions.
SBED is software for small-scale (centimeter- to meter-scale) geological heterogeneity modeling and upscaling.

===ReservoirStudio===

ReservoirStudio (formerly SBEDStudio) enables users to build scenarios by modeling the multi-scale structures and lithologies that impact fluid flow. By simulating multiple geological scenarios in SBEDStudio, users can rank the scenarios and evaluate reservoir performance with a realistic range of uncertainty. Users can refine scenarios by distributing the effective property relationships generated from SBED within SBEDStudio's property grids.
ReservoirStudio reservoir modeling software integrates well log, seismic, stratigraphic, lithofacies and petrophysical data to build  realistic models for predicting reservoir production profiles and managing reservoir risk.

===AttributeStudio===

AttributeStudio is Windows-based software for seismic attribute generation, visualization, calibration, classification and interpretation. AttributeStudio allows users to see beyond broadband seismic resolution and aids in extracting the right attributes.
AttributeStudio enables users to visualize data at multiple seismic resolutions and to identify the attributes that impact hydrocarbon distribution.

==Plug-ins==

Geomodeling is in the process of developing SBED and Reservoir Studio as a direct Plug-In to Schlumberger's Petrel seismic simulation software. Geomodelingâ€™s software works with the Petrel workflow and data structure. SBED For Petrel can be used to estimate effective properties upscaled from lamina-scale models. ReservoirStudio for Petrel provides process-oriented stratigraphic layering and facies distribution.
