==History==

Originally, Swedish Wikipedia rivalled susning.nu, a wiki created by Lars Aronsson in 2001. susning.nu was by 28 May 2003 the world's second largest wiki. Due to several controversies involving the authority of the founder, objections to Aronsson's decision to allow advertisement on the site, and the lack of proper tools to fight vandalism, several prolific susning-writers switched over to Swedish Wikipedia in 2002, and later more followed. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl] In April 2004, susning.nu's editing features were closed down to all but a handful of users, which further increased the flow to Swedish Wikipedia. On 14 January 2005, Wikipedia's article count surpassed that of susning.nu.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]
In March 2006, the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet published a comparative evaluation of Swedish Wikipedia, susning.nu and the online version of Nationalencyklopedin. The evaluation was done by giving a selection of articles to independent subject matter experts for grading. While Nationalencyklopedin came out on top with respect to factuality and neutrality, Swedish Wikipedia received a good overall grade and came out on top with respect to being up to date and having a broad coverage, also including popular culture subjects.[tpl]cite news |title=Gratis nätlexikon får bra betyg |first=Ulrika |last=Nandra |url=http://www.svd.se/kultur/gratis-natlexikon-far-bra-betyg_305804.svd |newspaper=Svenska Dagbladet |language=Swedish |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zc78dWm1 |archivedate=21 June 2011 |date=30 March 2006 |accessdate=21 June 2011[/tpl]

===Recent development===

On 27 September 2012 it reached 500,000 articles.[tpl]cite press release |title=Grattis Sverige - nu har vi en halv miljon Wikipedia-artiklar! |publisher=Wikimedia Sverige |date=27 September 2012 |url=http://nyheter.se.msn.com/photopage.aspx?cp-documentid=251471807 |language=Swedish |accessdate=27 September 2012[/tpl] On 15 June 2013 it reached 1,000,000 articles and rose from 8th to 5th place."List of Wikipedias". Meta.wikimedia.org, 2013-06-16. Retrieved 16 June 2013. This meant that during 2012 and 2013 the number of articles on Swedish Wikipedia more than doubled. This is in large part due to a community project where bots are used in producing articles for all existing species of plants and animals. When finished, this project alone will have created more than a million articles, most short but extensively sourced through available online databases on the subject."Användare:Lsjbot". Sv.wikipedia.org. Retrieved 16 June 2013.
