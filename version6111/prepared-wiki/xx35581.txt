Tathra National Park is a national park in Western Australia (Australia), located [tpl]convert|240|km|mi|0[/tpl] north of Perth between the towns of Eneabba and Carnamah on Winchester-Eneabba Road. The name is derived from a Noongar word meaning "beautiful place".

==Description==

The park is set in sandplain country and is surrounded by farmland, somehow having managed to escape clearing by wheat farmers in the early 20th century.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Western-Australia/Eneabba/2005/02/17/1108500208425.html|title=Travel - Eneabba|date=8 February 2004|author=Fairfax Digital|accessdate=11 August 2007 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald[/tpl] Shallow valleys with sandy floors change to laterite on the slopes and hilltops, and the low heath changes in composition accordingly. The park is considered a representative sample of flora of the area, although includes some unusual plants - including a species of Daviesia notable for its large red flowers, which is known only from the reserve, and Shaggy Dryandra (Banksia splendida) which is common on some lateritic rises. Public usage of the park was mainly for wildflower observation in winter and spring according to a 1974 report, whose recommendation (which was not followed) would have seen it demoted to a flora and fauna conservation reserve.[tpl]cite book|title=Conservation Reserves in Western Australia - Report 1974 (Green Book)|author=Conservation through Reserves Committee|publisher=Environmental Protection Authority of Western Australia|date=31 January 1975|isbn=0-7244-5934-0|pages=5–20, 5–21[/tpl]
