Mika Pauli Häkkinen ([tpl]Audio|Fi-Mika_Häkkinen.ogg|pronunciation[/tpl]) (born 28 September 1968 in Vantaa in the Helsinki metropolitan area) is a Finnish former racing driver and two-time Formula One World Champion.
Häkkinen debuted in F1 with Lotus in 1991 after a successful career in karting and different junior formula categories. After two years with Lotus, he joined McLaren as a test driver in 1993 initially as a backup for Ayrton Senna, but took over the responsibility of race driver after Michael Andretti was dismissed by the team after that year's Italian Grand Prix. In 1994, he became the lead driver of the team after Senna left to join Williams. Following a life-threatening injury during a practice session for the 1995 Australian Grand Prix and a remarkable comeback to professional racing, Häkkinen and McLaren made considerable improvements in 1996 and 1997 with Häkkinen taking his first victory at the 1997 European Grand Prix. Häkkinen won back to back titles in 1998–99 against the Ferrari drivers Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine respectively. In 2000, Häkkinen won four races but the title was won  by Schumacher. This was followed by two more victories in 2001, and the announcement of a sabbatical the same year that later turned into retirement.
After retiring from Formula One, Häkkinen drove in the DTM series, in which he won three races with Mercedes before announcing his retirement from competitive motorsports in 2007.

==Early life==

Häkkinen was born in Helsingin maalaiskunta (now Vantaa), Finland on 28 September 1968 to Harri, a shortwave radio operator and a part-time taxi driver, and Aila Häkkinen, who worked as a secretary. Häkkinen grew up with one sister, Nina, who ran a fan site for her brother until its closure in 1998. As a child, Häkkinen lived in the same street as Mika Salo with the two later becoming friends.

==Racing career==

===Pre-Formula One (until 1990)===

When Häkkinen was five years old, his parents hired a go-kart for him to take to a track near their home. On his first lap, Häkkinen was involved in an accident but he escaped unhurt. Despite this crash, Häkkinen wished to continue racing and after persistently annoying his parents, the young Finn got his wish fulfilled. His father bought Häkkinen his first go-kart, one that Henri Toivonen had previously competed with.[tpl]cite web |author=Gagnon, Marie–Julie |title=Le fil de Mika |work=Radio Canada |url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/Branche/v4/93/F1.htm |accessdate=2006-11-14 |language=French[/tpl]
By 1986, Häkkinen had won five karting championships. [tpl]f1|1982[/tpl] World Champion Keke Rosberg had helped Häkkinen by arranging him sponsorship that aided the Finn through the junior categories of open wheel racing. The "New Flying Finn" won three Scandinavian championships and the Opel Lotus Euroseries championship in 1988 before winning the 1990 British Formula Three championship. During the late 1980s he lived in England and shared a house with West Surrey Racing team mate Allan McNish.Allan McNish interview[tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl] Häkkinen was close to winning the 1990 Macau Grand Prix but missed out due to a controversial accident with Michael Schumacher, which resulted in his promotion to Formula One with Team Lotus.

===Formula One (1991–2001)===

====Lotus (1991–1992)====

=====1991=====

Häkkinen joined Lotus in [tpl]f1|1991[/tpl]. He qualified 13th for his Grand Prix debut at Phoenix, and would also have finished the race in the same position had his car not experienced an engine failure on lap 60. Häkkinen scored his first Grand Prix points two rounds later in Imola, where he finished fifth from 25th on the grid, three laps behind the race winner, Ayrton Senna. Häkkinen finished the season at joint 15th position alongside Satoru Nakajima and Martin Brundle.

=====1992=====

Johnny Herbert joined Häkkinen for [tpl]f1|1992[/tpl] season. The Finn continued his form from 1991, with point-scoring finishes in six Grands Prix, his best finishes being fourth places in France and Hungary. Häkkinen finished the season at eighth place in the Drivers' Championship, with almost six times as many points as during the previous season.

====McLaren (1993–2001)====

=====1993=====

In [tpl]f1|1993[/tpl], Häkkinen joined McLaren as test driver with a view to be promoted to the race team later on.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2007[/tpl] In Monaco he returned to racing with a guest drive in the Porsche Supercup race, an event he dominated. His hopes of stepping up to the race team were realised after Monza, when Michael Andretti left F1 after disappointing results. Häkkinen's McLaren race debut in Portugal was impressive. In his first outing for the team, he outqualified their star driver Ayrton Senna. Unfortunately, when pushing too hard through the final corner of the track during the race, he ran wide onto the dirty side of the kerb, launching the car towards the pit wall. At the time he was running in a point-scoring position. He went on to score a podium finish fifteen seconds behind his triple world champion team-mate during the next weekend at Suzuka, his first career podium.
During 1993, Häkkinen, along with Ayrton Senna, tested the Lamborghini V12 engine in a modified version of the McLaren MP4/8 race car dubbed the "MP4/8B" at both Estoril and Silverstone. Both drivers were impressed with the engine, with Häkkinen reportedly lapping Silverstone some 1.4 seconds faster in the MP4/8B with its V12 engine than he had with the team's race car fitted with the Ford V8.

=====1994=====

With Senna departing for Williams for the [tpl]f1|1994[/tpl] season, Häkkinen became the leading driver for McLaren with Martin Brundle as his teammate. McLaren had also switched from the V8 Ford engines to Peugeot V10s (a handshake deal was reportedly done for McLaren to use the Lamborghini V12 the team had tested in 1993, but team boss Ron Dennis decided on Peugeot instead). During the season, Häkkinen took six more podium finishes to add to his sole podium of 1993, including a second place in Belgium. He finished the year at fourth place in the Drivers' Championship with a tally of 26 points. McLaren's season was hampered by the Peugeot V10's which had a nasty habit of blowing up during both qualifying and races.

=====1995=====

[tpl]f1|1995[/tpl] saw the start of a long relationship between Häkkinen's McLaren team and the German car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz. Before the season began, Häkkinen and team-mate Nigel Mansell had complained that the new car had been too small for them to fit in and they suffered from their hands and elbows bashing on the sides of the cockpit.[tpl]cite web|title=McLaren's cockpit cock-up|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00048.html|publisher=Grandprix.com|date=1995-03-15|accessdate=2012-09-16[/tpl]
A further two second places in Italy and Japan put Häkkinen's tally of podiums up to nine. He missed the Pacific Grand Prix at Aida due to an appendix operation.
At Adelaide, he suffered a tyre failure at the early part of the first qualifying session, which resulted in him crashing heavily into the wall. He was critically injured in the crash, sustaining a skull fracture, internal bleeding and swallowing of his tongue which caused a blocking of his airway, and was saved only due to an emergency cricothyroidotomy that was performed by the side of the track by Sid Watkins.[tpl]cite book |last=Tremayne |first=David |coauthors=Mark Hughes |title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Formula One |year=2001 |publisher=Parragon |isbn=0-7525-6557-5 [/tpl] This incident forged a strong bond between Häkkinen and team principal Ron Dennis, and also sent forth a new movement for extra safety in the sport. Luckily, Häkkinen recovered fully and was fit to race again in 1996, thus missing only one race. Häkkinen climbed back into a Formula One car at Paul Ricard three months after the accident.[tpl]cite news|last=Tremayne|first=David|title=F1 motor racing: Hakkinen's street car of desire |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/f1-motor-racing-hakkinens-street-car-of-desire-1157131.html|publisher=The Independent|date=1998-05-24|accessdate=2012-09-16|location=London[/tpl]

=====1996=====

The 1996 season saw McLaren improve; Mercedes-Benz were in their second season of supplying engines to the team and Häkkinen managed to return to the podium, although his first win still eluded him. That season saw David Coulthard join the team from Williams.
Häkkinen finished 4th at Brazil.[tpl]cite news|title=Hill captures Brazilian Grand Prix|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=racyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4uYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4933,98733&dq=mika+hakkinen&hl=en|newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World|date=1 April 1996|page=6C[/tpl] He scored points at the next four races in Monaco, Spain, Canada and France. At the Spa circuit he nearly registered his first win while using a one stop race strategy, until Jos Verstappen's accident allowed all other cars to pit under the safety car. Based on timing, Häkkinen would have won the race by over 10 seconds without this event. Häkkinen finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship, scoring a total of 31 points. Häkkinen finished the season at 3rd place in Japan.[tpl]cite news|last=Tremayne|first=David|title=Motor Racing: Jubilant Hill reaches the summit|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-jubilant-hill-reaches-the-summit-1358283.html|publisher=The Independent|date=14 October 1996|accessdate=25 November 2012|location=London[/tpl]

=====1997=====

For 1997 season, Häkkinen was linked to Benetton and Williams.[tpl]cite web|title=Hakkinen to Benetton?|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00648.html|publisher=grandprix.com|date=17 June 1996|accessdate=24 November 2012[/tpl]
But he decided to continue at McLaren. McLaren were confident of success in [tpl]f1|1997[/tpl]. With the distinctive red and white colours of Marlboro replaced by the silver and black colours of West, the team returned to their winning ways. His teammate David Coulthard took the first win for McLaren in over three seasons at the Australian Grand Prix. Through the year the McLarens began to regularly challenge the frontrunners, but it was Coulthard who finished higher in the championship. Häkkinen came close to an elusive breakthrough victory a number of times in 1997, not least at Silverstone, A1-Ring and Nürburgring. At the seasong ending race in Jerez, Häkkinen finally won his first race, after a crash between frontrunners Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve, which caused Schumacher to retire from the race and led to him being disqualified from the Drivers' Championship. Villeneuve was able to finish the race with a damaged car, but his delay from the accident allowed Häkkinen and Coulthard to pass on the last lap for a McLaren double podium.

=====1998=====

The 1998 season began with Häkkinen winning four of the first six rounds. However, Schumacher won the next three races, allowing him to close the gap to Häkkinen in the Drivers' Championship standings. Then Häkkinen won back to back races in Austria and Germany.[tpl]cite news|title=Hakkinen wins in German Grand Prix|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/formula_1/143966.stm|publisher=BBC News (BBC)|date=2 August 1998|accessdate=24 November 2012[/tpl] In Hungary Häkkinen gathered only one point due to problems with the car's gearbox, and in Belgium he had to retire after spinning the car followed by a crash with Johnny Herbert. Meanwhile, Schumacher was able to climb to only seven points behind him at the Drivers' Standings. At Monza, Häkkinen managed a splendid start, but soon after ran into technical problems. At the end, Häkkinen managed fourth while Schumacher took victory. At this point in the season, Häkkinen and Schumacher were tied at the top of the standings at 80 points, with only two races left. At the penultimate race at the Nürburgring, Ferrari managed a front row lockout with Schumacher on the pole and Häkkinen immediately behind the Ferraris. Nevertheless, Häkkinen managed to win the race, securing a 4-point lead in the Drivers' Standings before the season's last race.[tpl]cite news|last=Spurgeon|first=Brad|title=Hakkinen Victorious in Luxembourg Grand Prix|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/28/sports/28iht-prix.t_1.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=28 September 1998|accessdate=24 November 2012[/tpl]
Both contenders arrived to the finale at Suzuka with the title still up for grabs. Häkkinen was clearly favored due to the superiority of the McLaren, though the Ferrari had developed during the course of the Championship. Schumacher took pole at the qualifying, with Häkkinen just beside him. At the warm-up lap however, the clutch of Schumacher's car got stuck and he was forced to start from the back of the grid, elevating Häkkinen to the front of the grid. Schumacher made a good recovery during the race, but was eventually forced to retire. Häkkinen went on to lead the race from start to finish and claim his first World Drivers' Champion title.[tpl]cite news|last=Zaun|first=Todd|title=Hakkinen wins race, Formula One crown|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VIVIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zG8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3714,3757154&dq=mika+hakkinen&hl=en|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=November 2, 1998|page=D-3[/tpl] Overall, Häkkinen managed to win eight races and 13 points placings in 16 races, and claimed the World Championship at 100 points, ahead of Schumacher at 86 points. In addition, Häkkinen started from the pole position nine times out of 16.

=====1999=====

The 1999 Championship proved to be a more difficult season for Häkkinen and McLaren. The MP4/14, again designed by Newey, was shown to be a competitive car capable of fighting for the World Championship, though was less mechanically reliable than its 1998 predecessor. As well as reliability issues, Häkkinen made several errors throughout the season which cost him likely victories on two occasions. The Ferrari team produced a competitive car in the form of the F399, though their title hopes diminished after lead driver Michael Schumacher broke his leg at the British Grand Prix and was forced to miss six races. Eddie Irvine took up the Championship challenge for Ferrari, claiming four victories for the Italian team during the season and taking the title to the wire. Ultimately Häkkinen was able to celebrate a second consecutive world title after taking victory in the final round of the Championship at Suzuka.
Häkkinen's season began with pole position at Melbourne ahead of teammate David Coulthard. The mechanical problems that were to hamper the MP4/14 on further occasions during the season struck both McLaren cars during the race. First Coulthard, then Häkkinen dropped out of the running with gearbox failure, handing Ferrari's Eddie Irvine his maiden Grand Prix victory. Häkkinen fought back at the next round of the Championship in Brazil, scoring a pole position, fastest lap and a win. A third pole position of the season followed in Imola, but an error on lap 18 saw Häkkinen crash out of the lead. Häkkinen again took pole in Monaco but come race day finished third behind the Ferrari pair of Schumacher and Irvine. Back-to-back wins in Barcelona and in Canada (the first Formula One Grand Prix to be finished under Safety Car conditions) boosted the Finn's title hopes, moving him 4 points ahead of Michael Schumacher at the top of the World Drivers' Championship. Häkkinen extended his Championship lead by a further 4 points with a second place finish in France behind the Jordan of Heinz-Harald Frentzen. A retirement due to a loose wheel at Silverstone followed, while closest rival Schumacher suffered a serious accident at Stowe corner which put the German out of the next six rounds of the Championship with a broken leg.
Häkkinen started from pole position once more in Austria. The Finn was forced to fight his way through the field after contact at the beginning of the race with his teammate Coulthard, which left him in last position at the end of the first lap. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race and eventually finished third. The next round, the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim saw Häkkinen crash out at high speed following a rear tyre failure on lap 26. Irvine, now leading Ferrari's title challenge, proceeded to take victory in the Grand Prix with the assistance of teammate Mika Salo and moved 8 points clear of Häkkinen at the top of the World Championship. Häkkinen responded with a dominant win from pole in Hungary, then second place in Belgium behind teammate Coulthard, moving the Finn ahead of Irvine by a point in the Drivers' Championship. At the next round in Italy Häkkinen made an unforced error, spinning out of the race at Monza's first chicane on lap 30 while leading comfortably. Häkkinen proceeded to break down in tears in full view of the television cameras after throwing his steering wheel and gloves to the ground while walking away from his stalled McLaren.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8244549.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hakkinen loses his cool in Monza | date=8 September 2009[/tpl] Häkkinen finished fifth at the rain affected European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring where rival Irvine failed to score, before finishing third in Malaysia behind Irvine and the returning Michael Schumacher. At the final round in Japan Häkkinen took victory, securing his second Formula One World Drivers' Championship, more than a minute and a half ahead of title rival Irvine while Schumacher finished a close second.[tpl]cite news|title=PLUS: AUTO RACING – JAPANESE GRAND PRIX; Hakkinen Reclaims Formula One Title|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/01/sports/plus-auto-racing-japanese-grand-prix-hakkinen-reclaims-formula-one-title.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=1999-11-01|accessdate=2012-08-29[/tpl]

=====2000=====

As a double World Champion, he had joined an elite group of drivers. For the 2000 season, he was eager to score a hat-trick of crowns, but after a season-long contest, finished 19 points behind Ferrari's Schumacher. Häkkinen took victory in Spain,[tpl]cite web|title=Hakkinen leads McLaren's 1–2 finish|url=http://espn.go.com/auto/formulaone/news/2000/0507/520619.html|publisher=ESPN|date=2000-05-07|accessdate=2012-09-16[/tpl] Austria where he led every lap of the race[tpl]cite news|title=PLUS: AUTO RACING – AUSTRIAN GRAND PRIX; Hakkinen Victory Revives Title Bid|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/17/sports/plus-auto-racing-austrian-grand-prix-hakkinen-victory-revives-title-bid.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=17 July 2000|accessdate=5 November 2012[/tpl] and in Hungary to take the lead of the world championship standings.[tpl]cite news|title=Hakkinen Takes F-1 Lead|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/08/13/sports/main224339.shtml|publisher=CBS News (CBS)|date=August 2000|accessdate=5 November 2012[/tpl] At Spa, he took a memorable victory, with a breathtaking simultaneous pass on Michael Schumacher and Ricardo Zonta in the Kemmel straight.[tpl]cite news|title=Hakkinen wins Belgian thriller|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/898476.stm|publisher=BBC Sport (BBC)|date=2000-08-27|accessdate=2012-09-16[/tpl] At the next Grand Prix Schumacher took over the Championship lead, and went on to confirm his third world championship at the Japanese Grand Prix, the penultimate race of the season.

=====2001=====

In [tpl]F1|2001[/tpl], he took part in what would prove to be his last season of Formula One, before being replaced by his young compatriot and protégé Kimi Räikkönen. The MP4-16 was not as competitive and it was Coulthard who carried the threat to Schumacher for much of the season.
Häkkinen suffered a sizeable crash due to a front suspension failure at the opening race in Australia at Melbourne, while running second. The accident seemed to have hindered his motivation considerably. In Brazil, Häkkinen stalled on the grid which almost forced Olivier Panis to collide with the stalled car. Häkkinen received a $5,000 fine for his actions.[tpl]cite web|title=GRAND PRIX RESULTS: BRAZILIAN GP, 2001|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr666.html|publisher=grandprix.com|accessdate=5 November 2012[/tpl] In Spain, he was in the lead on the last lap to record his fourth straight Spanish Grand Prix victory but he had a clutch failure and was forced to retire, just five corners away from victory. Häkkinen, stranded, was later fetched by Coulthard in the other McLaren, with Häkkinen sitting at the side of the car, back to the pit. It was a sad but memorable moment, reminding fans of the strong bonds between Coulthard and Häkkinen. At Silverstone he dominated the race to take his first victory of the year. At Monza, Häkkinen announced to the media that he was to take a sabbatical for 2002 deciding on his future in the process. At Indianapolis he won his last grand prix[tpl]cite news|title=Hakkinen wins at Indianapolis|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/1572280.stm|publisher=BBC Sport (BBC)|date=30 September 2001|accessdate=24 November 2012[/tpl] which was followed up with a 4th in Japan.[tpl]cite news|title=Coulthard runner-up but points record is a Schu-in|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2001/oct/15/formulaone.formulaone2001|publisher=The Guardian|date=15 October 2001|accessdate=24 November 2012|location=London[/tpl]
By mid-2002, Häkkinen decided to take full-time retirement. He cited the reason for spending more time with his family and not to risk any injuries.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2152164.stm |title=Hakkinen announces retirement |date=26 July 2002 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=11 February 2010[/tpl] He also revealed at the 2001 Monaco Grand Prix that he informed Ron Dennis of his decision to retire and was given the opportunity for the sabbatical to go ahead.[tpl]cite web|title=Hakkinen retires as McLaren remains unchanged|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns06733.html|publisher=grandprix.com|date=26 July 2002|accessdate=24 November 2012[/tpl]

===DTM (2005–2007)===

During 2004 Häkkinen announced plans for a Grand Prix comeback and held talks with Williams for 2005. A deal was not reached and he  made a race comeback in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM), with Mercedes-Benz instead. It was a successful season, including one win at Spa.
During 2006 he again competed in the DTM championships with Mercedes. It was a more difficult season having a couple of second places as his best results. Autosport magazine had speculated that Häkkinen's style of driving is not especially suited to a DTM car.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
At the 2006 Goodwood Festival Of Speed, Häkkinen drove the 2005 McLaren-Mercedes MP4-20. Many said that it was great once again to see Häkkinen in a McLaren, as he was the last driver (at that time) to win the World Championship in a McLaren.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/formula_1/500415.stm |title=BBC Report on Final GP of 1999 Season |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-11-01 |accessdate=2010-10-02[/tpl]
Häkkinen would stay on at Mercedes for a third season and although this was tainted by some bad luck in places, 2007 was to be his most competitive. Regularly qualifying on the front row, he took two wins at Lausitz and Mugello on his way to 8th position in the championship.

===Possible returns to F1===

After Häkkinen's sabbatical year and subsequent retirement, rumours of his return were reported on several occasions. Häkkinen was linked to Williams during the 2004 season because of Montoya going to McLaren-Mercedes the following year.[tpl]cite news |title=Häkkinen return dismissed |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2004-05-31 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/3764289.stm |accessdate=2006-12-14[/tpl]
At the end of the 2006 season there were further rumours regarding Häkkinen returning to the wheel of a McLaren-Mercedes for the 2007 season. Autosport magazine reported that Häkkinen had tested a McLaren simulator twice during November and discussed a possible comeback with the team. On November 24 McLaren announced that Lewis Hamilton would take the team's second seat in 2007,[tpl]cite web |title=Who's Who: Lewis Hamilton |publisher=F1Fanatic.co.uk |year=2006 |url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/f1-information/whos-who/whos-who-h/lewis-hamilton/ |accessdate=2006-12-09[/tpl] ending the speculation of a possible return to a Formula One drivers seat. However, it was reported that Häkkinen had participated in an advisory role, with Ron Dennis stating that "He's a very interesting person to bring in and evaluate some of the things we are developing."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6182132.stm |title=Hakkinen happy after McLaren test |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2010-10-02[/tpl] On Thursday, November 30, Häkkinen tested the 2006 McLaren-Mercedes MP4-21 for a full day at the Circuit de Catalunya, in Barcelona, Spain. He completed 79 laps of the circuit, but his fastest lap was three seconds off the pace of regular race drivers. McLaren said they were using his expertise to see how Formula One had evolved over the years since his retirement.
Häkkinen had also been named as the Responsible Drinking Ambassador for McLaren sponsor Johnnie Walker.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns17797.html |title=Hakkinen Lands Drink-Drive Role |publisher=Grandprix.com |date=2006-11-23 |accessdate=2010-10-02[/tpl]

==Helmet==

Häkkinen's helmet was white with a dark blue stripe, a royal blue stripe and a sky blue stripe in the middle, a blue circle on the top and his name written in the chin area of his helmet. Colours were based on his early sponsor Oy G.W. Sohlberg Ab's brand in 1980's.

==Personal life==

Since 1991, Häkkinen has resided in Monte Carlo although he also owns houses in France and Finland. On 18 May 2008, his newly completed mansion in France was burned down after a light in one of his trophy cabinets short circuited.
