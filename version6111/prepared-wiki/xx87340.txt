==Overview==

The sleeve states that Live Evil was recorded in Seattle, San Antonio and Dallas during the 1982 tour in support of the Mob Rules album, but doesn't give the venues or recording dates for the individual songs. 
Vocalist Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice abruptly left the group during the mixing of Live Evil, after the album's engineer told guitarist Tony Iommi that Dio had been sneaking into the studio at night to adjust the mix. Dio steadfastly denied that this ever occurred and laid the blame on the engineer, who was 'telling tales'.Marszalek, Julian.

Iommi has said that the decision to release Live Evil was prompted by two factors. The first was the 1980 release of the unsanctioned Live at Last album, and the second was former lead vocalist Ozzy Osbourne's 1982 release of a live album consisting entirely of Black Sabbath songs.[tpl]cite book |last=Iommi |first=Tony |title=Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven and Hell with Black Sabbath |accessdate=July 21, 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0306819551[/tpl]
