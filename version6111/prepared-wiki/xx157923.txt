Panthera schreuderi is a possible pre-historic species of large cat, that is now extinct. It lived in Europe during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene. Turner and O'Brien, among others, have argued that the few known specimens all belong, instead, to the species P. gombazoegensis, the extinct European Jaguar.[tpl]cite journal | author = O'Regan, H & Turner, A | year = 2004 | title = Biostratigraphic & palaeoecological implications of new fossil felid material from the Plio-Pleistocene site of Tegelen, the Netherlands | journal = Palaeontology | volume = 47 | issue = 5 | url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0031-0239.2004.00400.x?cookieSet=1 | pages = 1181â€“1193 | doi = 10.1111/j.0031-0239.2004.00400.x[/tpl]
