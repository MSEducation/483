Pedasus (Πήδασος) was the name of several places in Greek mythology. There was a Pedasus in (or near) the Troad, on the Satnioeis river, said to be inhabited by a tribe called the Leleges.  During the Trojan War, this Pedasus was ruled over by a certain king named Altes, and sacked by Achilles. Other places named Pedasus were in Caria, and Messenia. 
In Homer's Iliad, Pedasus was the name of a Trojan warrior, and the son of the naiad Abarbarea and human Bucolion. His twin brother was Aesepus; both were slain by Euryalus, the son of Mecisteus during the Trojan War.
