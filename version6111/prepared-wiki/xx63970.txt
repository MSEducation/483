John Sterling (20 July 1806 – 18 September 1844), was a Scottish author.

==Life==

He was born at Kames Castle on the Isle of Bute, the son of Edward Sterling. After studying for a year at the University of Glasgow, he in 1824 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he had for tutor Julius Charles Hare.[tpl]acad|id=STRN824J|name=Sterling, John[/tpl] At Cambridge he took part in the debates of the Cambridge Union Society, and became a member of the Cambridge Apostles, forming friendships with Frederick Denison Maurice and Richard Trench. He moved to Trinity Hall with the intention of graduating in law, but left the university without taking a degree.
During the next four years Sterling resided chiefly in London, employing himself actively in literature and making a number of literary friends. With F. D. Maurice he purchased the Athenaeum magazine in 1828 from James Silk Buckingham, but the enterprise was not a financial success. He also formed an intimacy with the Spanish revolutionist General Torrijos,General Torrijos article in Spanish Wikipedia in whose unfortunate expedition he took an active interest. But he did not accompany it, as he was kept in England by his marriage to Susannah, daughter of Lieutenant-General Charles Barton (1760–1819) and his wife Susannah.
Shortly after his marriage in 1830 symptoms of tuberculosis induced him to take up his residence in the island of St Vincent, where he had inherited some property, and he remained there fifteen months before returning to England. After spending some time on the Continent in June 1834 he was ordained and became curate at Hurstmonceux, where his old tutor Julius Hare was vicar. Acting on the advice of his physician he resigned his clerical duties in the following February, but, according to Carlyle, the primary cause was a divergence from the opinions of the Church. There remained to him the "resource of the pen," but, having to "live all the rest of his days as in continual flight for his very existence," his literary achievements were necessarily fragmentary.
In 1841 Sterling moved to Falmouth, and lectured to the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society.Eric W. Nye, ‘Sterling, John (1806–1844)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 16 Nov 2007 He died at Ventnor on 18 September 1844, his wife having died in the preceding year.

==Works==

Sterling published in 1833 Arthur Coningsby, a novel, which attracted little attention, and his Poems (1839), the Election, a Poem (1841), and Strafford, a tragedy (1843), were not more successful. He had, however, established a connection in 1837 with Blackwood's Magazine, to which he contributed a variety of papers and several tales. Among these papers were  allegorical fantasy stories such as "The Onyx Ring", "Land and Sea",
"A Chronicle of England" and "The Palace of Morgana."[ref]Brian Stableford,

John Sterling's papers were given to the joint care of Thomas Carlyle and Hare. Essays and Tales, by John Sterling collected and edited, with a memoir of his life, by Julius Charles Hare, appeared in 1848 in two volumes. Carlyle was dissatisfied with the Memoir and wrote a vivid Life (1851).
Sterling corresponded with John Stuart Mill, who had attended the informal beginnings of his 'Sterling Club'.The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume XIV - The Later Letters of John Stuart Mill 1849-1873 Part I, ed.
