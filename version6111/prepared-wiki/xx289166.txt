Jay Shendure is an American scientist and human geneticist at the University of Washington. He is Associate Professor in the Department of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/shendure.htm |title=UW Genome Sciences: Jay Shendure |publisher=Gs.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-04[/tpl] and an Affiliate Investigator in the Human Biology Division at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.fhcrc.org/en/labs/profiles/shendure-jay.html |title=Jay Shendure, MD, PhD |publisher=Fhcrc.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-04[/tpl]
Shendure’s research is focused on developing and applying new technologies in genomics. In 2005, his doctoral research with George M. Church resulted one of the first successful proof-of-concepts of next-generation DNA sequencing.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/09/science/09dna.html|title=2 New Methods to Sequence DNA Promise Vastly Lower Costs|author=Nicholas Wade|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2014-02-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/milestones/miledna/full/miledna18.html |title=Milestone 18 : Nature Milestones in DNA |publisher=Nature.com |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2014-02-04[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid| 23472755[/tpl] Shendure's research group at the University of Washington pioneered exome sequencing and its application to Mendelian disorders,[tpl]cite web|author=Elie Dolgin |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091113/full/news.2009.1085.html |title=Selective sequencing solves a genetic mystery : Nature News |publisher=Nature.com |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2014-02-04[/tpl] a strategy that has been applied to identify hundreds of disease-causing genes.[tpl]cite web|author=Jocelyn Kaiser |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6006/903.summary |title=Affordable 'Exomes' Fill Gaps in a Catalog of Rare Diseases |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2014-02-04[/tpl] Other notable accomplishments of Shendure’s laboratory include the first whole genome sequencing of a human fetus using samples obtained non-invasively from the parents,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/health/tests-of-parents-are-used-to-map-genes-of-a-fetus.html?hp|title=DNA Blueprint for Fetus Built Using Tests of Parents|author=Andrew Pollack|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2014-02-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Lopatto |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-06/blood-saliva-analysis-may-replace-invasive-prenatal-test.html |title=Blood-Saliva Analysis May Replace Invasive Prenatal Test |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2014-02-04[/tpl] and the sequencing of the HeLa genome in agreement with Henrietta Lacks’ family.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/science/after-decades-of-research-henrietta-lacks-family-is-asked-for-consent.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&|title=After Decades of Research Henrietta Lack's Family is Asked for Consent|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2014-02-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.nature.com/news/deal-done-over-hela-cell-line-1.13511 |title=Deal done over HeLa cell line : Nature News & Comment |publisher=Nature.com |date=2013-08-07 |accessdate=2014-02-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v500/n7461/full/500141a.html |title=Biospecimen policy: Family matters : Nature : Nature Publishing Group |publisher=Nature |date= |accessdate=2014-02-04[/tpl]
Shendure graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1996 and completed a Fulbright scholarship at Pune, India, in 1997. He then entered the Medical Scientist Training Program at Harvard Medical School and received his Ph.D. in 2005 and his M.D. in 2007. He joined the faculty at the Department of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington in 2007 and was tenured as an associate professor four years later in 2011.
