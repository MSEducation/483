Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu ([tpl]IPA-ro|horˈtensi.a papaˈdat benˈd͡ʒesku[/tpl]; 8 December 1876 - 5 March 1955 in Bucharest) was a novelist of the Romanian interwar period.

==Life==

She was born in Ivești, Galați County, the daughter of General Dimitrie Bengescu and of Zoe (born Stefǎnescu). She attended high-school in Bucharest and, aged 20, she married the magistrate Nicolae Papadat but her literary career was delayed because her husband was transferred from town to town (Turnu Măgurele, Buzău, Focşani, Constanţa) and because she had to take care of their four children: Nen, Zoe, Marcela and Elena.
