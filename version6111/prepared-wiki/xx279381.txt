Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits (also known as Bobby Joe Ebola) are an American acoustic folk-rock duo from Pinole, California. Formed in 1995, the traditional incarnation of the band consists of vocalist Corbett Redford III and guitarist/vocalist Dan Abbott. The duo is often joined onstage and in the studio by numerous musicians and friends for full band stage performances and recordings. Early performances featured occasional backup vocals from John Geek, also singer for Fleshies. Both Abbott, Redford and Geek were founding members of the indie label S.P.A.M. Records, and co-organizers of Geekfest, a series of free all-ages music festivals held in the late 1990s,[tpl]cite web|title=Dr. Foxmeat's Radio Show Episode 8|url=http://foxmeatradio.podbean.com/2012/10/23/dr-foxmeats-radio-show-episode-8/|publisher=Dr. Foxmeat's Radio Show|accessdate=October 23, 2012[/tpl] begun largely in response to the band's rejection from a then insular East Bay punk scene centered around 924 Gilman.[tpl]cite web|last=Boulware|first=Jack|title=Gimme Something Better|url=http://gimmesomethingbetter.com/excerpts/pyrates-n-geeks|publisher=Penguin Books|accessdate=September 29, 2009[/tpl]

==History==

===Origins===

Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits first formed in 1995,[tpl]cite news|last=DuShane|first=Tony|title=Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits|url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/bandwidth/article/Bobby-Joe-Ebola-and-the-Children-MacNuggits-3530169.php|publisher=SFGate Bandwidth[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=May 3, 2012|date=May 3, 2012[/tpl] when Corbett Redford, in an attempt to impress a girl, lied that he had a band that could play in lieu of another band cancelling their performance at the girl's birthday party.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gimmesomethingbetter.com/excerpts/pyrates-n-geeks |title=Pyrates & Geeks Â« Gimme Something Better |publisher=Gimmesomethingbetter.com |date=1997-09-13 |accessdate=2012-09-06[/tpl] The girl called his bluff and told him his band could perform at her party.[tpl]cite web|last=Carlson|first=Adam|title=Quirky duo take absurdity to a whole new level|url=http://www.redandblack.com/variety/quirky-duo-take-absurdity-to-a-whole-new-level/article_ae83b24f-f288-53c2-942c-0d063047e4b8.html|publisher=The Red & Black|accessdate=October 25, 2010[/tpl] Redford then called Abbott, who he had met when they were both attending Pinole Valley High School, and asked him if he would like to start a band. Abbott agreed and the band was formed.
The band's unusual name came from a conversation between Abbott and Redford in the parking lot of the Pinole Burger King minutes before their first show. Abbott recalled in an interview that "1995 was the year Ebola killed 300 people in the Congo, so that was in our heads. I guess we also liked the juxtaposition between suburban America (including us) turning themselves into greasy breaded lumps, and the brutal (though natural) internal liquefaction that, at the time, seemed like the most extreme way to die. Plus we were stoned to tears". The band has frequently mentioned during interviews that the name "Bobby Joe" is a reference to the character from the movie Evil Dead II named Bobby Joe,[tpl]cite web|last=Price|first=Robert|title=Beyond The Realm Of Comprehension Variety Show|url=http://stream.ashevillefm.org/beyondtherealmstream.m3u|publisher=Asheville FM|accessdate=2012-09-10[/tpl] portrayed by actress Kassie DePaiva.
The band self-released its debut EP, Two Cats Running,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Bobby-Joe-Ebola-And-The-Children-MacNuggits-The-Two-Cats-Running/release/1747517 |title=Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] The Two Cats Running (CD) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06[/tpl] in 1996, taking its cue for DIY music production from the East Bay punk scene. Two Cats was the first release on the label founded by Abbott, Redford, Geek and others, S.P.A.M. Records ("Smarmy Post-Angst Musicians"). The second S.P.A.M. Records release was a compilation entitled "If You Can't Laugh at Yourself, We'll Do It For You", featuring Bobby Joe Ebola and several other bands from West Contra Costa County.  The band attempted to perform at 924 Gilman in nearby Berkeley, California, at that point the only all-ages venue in the East Bay. The band found it impossible to get a show at 924 Gilman, and or to secure advertising in Maximumrocknroll.[tpl]cite web|url=http://carmelitasings.tribe.net/thread/ae74eaf9-a6c3-4047-97ab-f48b52accdfe |title=MaximumRocknRoll Column about Bobby Joe[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits |publisher=Carmelitasings.tribe.net |date=2006-04-10 |accessdate=2012-09-06[/tpl] Backup singer John Geek, spoke to then MRR coordinator Tim Yohannan, who explained that since Bobby Joe Ebola was not punk rock, MRR would not print advertising for the band.
Faced with this rejection by the pillars of the local punk rock community, the band and their friends decided to organize their own show. Renting a generator and a P.A. system, the group threw a free, all-ages festival at a shoreline park at Point Molate Beach Park. The festival was the first of a series of such events called Geekfest, and became the nucleus of a new subculture in East Bay music. was held without proper permits and therefore illegal.

===Geekfest and S.P.A.M. Records===

S.P.A.M. ("Smarmy Post Angst Musicians") Records was an underground collective of East Bay artists and musicians which began in 1996 with the release of Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits' "Two Cats Running EP" and a CD compilation of local bands entitled "If You Can't Laugh At Yourself We'll Do It For You".[tpl]cite web|url=http://bobbyjoeebola.com/?page_id=57 |title=Discography Â» Bobby Joe Ebola & The Children MacNuggits |publisher=Bobbyjoeebola.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06[/tpl] Abbott, Redford and Geek were the label's founding members, and both Redford and Geek served as head coordinators for the organization.[tpl]cite web|last=Swan|first=Rachel|title=The Geeks Grow Up|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/the-geeks-grow-up/Content?oid=1084131|publisher=East Bay Express|accessdate=2007-09-05[/tpl] Bobby Joe Ebola was its flagship band, and the label primarily produced music projects from S.P.A.M. members and the loose-knit Geekfest community.[tpl]cite web|last=Chambers|first=Chris|title=Episode 42[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits|url=http://www.lifeisapartypodcast.com/LIAPP/LifeIsAParty/Entries/2012/10/8_Episode_42_-_Bobby_Joe_Ebola_and_the_Children_MacNuggits.html|publisher=Life Is A Party Podcast|accessdate=10/8/12[/tpl]
Geekfest was a series of free, all-ages outdoor concerts organized by the S.P.A.M. Records collective beginning in 1997, largely in response to the difficulties of securing gigs for Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits and S.P.A.M.-affiliated bands. Due to a scarcity of all-ages venues in the San Francisco Bay Area, and the East Bay punk scene's identity crisis in the wake of mainstream commercial success by several formerly underground acts like Green Day and Rancid, the band found itself without places to play shows. Copying the tactics of the local underground rave scene, the first Geekfest events were held illegally at Point Molate Beach Park in Richmond, CA, part of a neglected Navy fuel depot beneath the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.
Shows were booked (and announced) via a voicemail connected to (510) BAD-SMUT on a first-come, first served basis, without regard to music genre or notoriety, or any official headlining bands. Thus, Geekfest became known for featuring an unpredictable variety of entertainment, and the undisclosed schedules meant that attendees had no idea when any particular act would play. As Geekfest became a semi-regular event with a culture all its own, its effects were felt on both Bobby Joe Ebola and on S.P.A.M. Records. The band, as the events coordinators, promoters, and hosts, networked and collaborated with touring bands and other show organizers, and nearly all S.P.A.M. releases were from veterans of Geekfest. In August 1998, the first Geekfest campout was held at Lake Lodoga, near central California's East Park Reservoir. Sometime later that year the S.P.A.M. collective met the Pyrate Punx, another group of show promoters, artists and musicians, who were primarily based out of the San Francisco Mission District's thriving punk scene. Recognizing shared values, if not always aesthetic ones, the two groups co-organized the second Geekfest campout, billed as Pyrates vs Geeks.[tpl]cite web|last=Koepke|first=Steve|title=TheList Search|url=http://jon.luini.com/falcon-bin/search-thelist.pl?query=Ladoga&archive=on|publisher=The List|accessdate=2012-09-20[/tpl] In subsequent years it became known as Libertatia, an event which is still organized annually by the Pyrate Punx community.
During this time, Bobby Joe Ebola was in the middle of a prolific songwriting and recording period. In 1997, the band released "Advice For Young Lovers" a split 7" record with Geekfest alumni Your Mother, and the 18-track "At One With The Dumb" CD (S.P.A.M.).
Both S.P.A.M. Records and Geekfest were initially organized out of a place known as Hermosa Street House in Pinole, CA, where several S.P.A.M. members had spent their youth. The local blighted suburban surroundings and low-wage service-industry employment served as fodder for many of Bobby Joe Ebola's early songs.[tpl]cite web|last=Sauter|first=Dan|title=030 â Bobby Joe Ebola|url=http://www.musicliferadio.com/2011/01/030-bobby-joe-ebola/|publisher=Music Life Radio|accessdate=2011-01-29[/tpl]
At around this time, the City of Richmond took notice of Geekfest and demanded that the events be covered by liability insurance which the collective members could not afford. Faced with an unsympathetic local press,[tpl]cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chip|title=FIGHT THE POWER|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/johnson/article/The-First-125-Years-Are-Hardest-Special-3003901.php|work =San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=1998-06-13|date=June 13, 1998[/tpl] and increasing opportunities for shows elsewhere, the S.P.A.M. collective moved to Oakland in 1998, renting out warehouse space at the Punx With Presses warehouse.

===Initial breakup and hiatus===

In 2000, Bobby Joe Ebola recorded and released Â¡Carmelita Sings!: Visions of a Rock Apocalypse (S.P.A.M.),[tpl]cite web|author=Â Posted by bobbyjoeebola at 6:29 pm |url=http://bobbyjoeebola.com/?page_id=57 |title=Discography Â» Bobby Joe Ebola & The Children MacNuggits |publisher=Bobbyjoeebola.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06[/tpl] a 26-track album that was as eclectic as it was confrontational. The album, engineered by Mauricio Acevedo in Richmond, CA, was the band's first digitally recorded endeavor and featured songs recorded both as the traditional two piece duo and with their full band ensemble. During this time, the band could sense that an implosion was near. Dan and Corbett were poor from studio and touring costs, exhausted, and struggling to run Geekfest and S.P.A.M. Records. The band had stopped being fun for them, and Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits called it quits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://unclecritic.com/2010/12/04/bobby-joe-ebola-and-the-children-macnuggits-interview/ |title=Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits interview |publisher=Unclecritic.com |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2012-09-06[/tpl]

==Musical style and influences==

Bobby Joe Ebola has described their band's sound as "pretty songs about awful things". Musically, they often deviate from their signature "satiric folk rock" sound to incorporate other styles, among them ska, punk rock, polka, dark folk, classic rock and even hip hop. The band has stated that their tendency to jump musical genres has to do with involving satire in their songs as well as letting the song's sound arrive organically[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] if the lyrics "ask" the band to play the song in a certain style, the band abides.[tpl]cite web|last=Sauter|first=Dan|title=031 â Children MacNuggits|url=http://www.musicliferadio.com/2011/02/031-children-macnuggits/|publisher=Music Life Radio|accessdate=2011-02-14[/tpl] Abbott and Redford often sing in harmony with one another and alternate taking lead vocal duties. When playing live, the group often mixes social commentary and standup comedy in between songs.
The band acknowledges The Hope Bombs, a self-proclaimed "geeky" punk rock band featuring future S.P.A.M. alumni and Bobby Joe Ebola studio musician Ben Morss and former Bobby Joe Ebola bassist Robert Eggplant from Blatz (band) as a musical inspiration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://owlmelon.com/cgi-bin/odd.pl?TheHopeBombs |title=TheHopeBombs |publisher=Owlmelon |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06[/tpl] The group is also inspired by satiric songwriter Tom Lehrer, the strange rock icon Frank Zappa, the eclectic alternative band They Might be Giants [tpl]cite web|last=Monard|first=Mauricio|title=bobby joe ebola & the children macnuggits converse with punkbank|url=http://www.punkbank.com/bobby-joe-ebola-the-children-macnuggits-conversan-con-punkbank/|publisher=PunkBank.Com|accessdate=October 6, 2012[/tpl] and many of the punk bands from the Bay Area's early 1990's punk-rock boom.
