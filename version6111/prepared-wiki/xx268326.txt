Trent Viaducts are railway bridges which carry the Midland Mainline over the River Trent between Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. 
Originally a single bridge, it was built by the engineer Charles Blacker Vignoles for the Midland Counties Railway in 1839.The Rise of the Midland Railway 1844-1874. E. G. Barnes, Augustus M. Kelley, New York, 1969. SBN 678060002 
The Viaduct was rebuilt in 1901 when a second crossing was added by the Midland Railway to carry the high-level goods line from Toton. The rebuilding included the removal of the cast iron spans supplied by the Butterley Company.
On the Midland Railway System Maps of 1918, the bridges are identified as bridges 27 and 27a.Midland Railway System Maps, distance diagrams, Sheet 13b. 1918
Just south of the viaducts are twin tunnels through Red Hill.
