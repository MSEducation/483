Canada's Walk of Fame ([tpl]lang-fr|Allée des célébrités canadiennes[/tpl]), located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, is a non-profit, registered charity and volunteer driven organization. Their mission is to engage Canadians in celebrating those who have excelled in music, sport, film, television, as well as the literary, visual, performing arts, science and innovation. It consists of a series of maple leaf-like stars embedded along King Street West in downtown Toronto. The stars are located in front of Roy Thomson Hall, The Princess of Wales Theatre, and The Royal Alexandra Theatre on King Street as well as Simcoe Street.
The first group of members was inducted in 1998, and to date 151 Canadians have been inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame. These Inductees include athletes; coaches; dancers; actors, directors, writers and producers of movies, television and stage; singers, songwriters and musicians; models; playwrights; authors; comedians; cartoonists; philanthropists and activists .

==History==

The Walk of Fame was first conceived in 1996 when co-founder, Peter Soumalias, suggested the idea of a Walk of Fame for famous Torontonians to the board of the Toronto Entertainment District Association. They rejected his idea, but he went on to establish a Walk of Fame for Canadians in partnership with Bill Ballard, Dusty Cohl and Gary Slaight. In spite of a lack of funds, research and no media plan, they managed to succeed and the first class of inductees was inducted in 1998. Canada's Walk of Fame has since become a popular tourist attraction in Toronto and has been named the number one Canadian recognition event.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/thewalk/history.xml.htm|title=History |author=Peter Soumalias|accessdate=2008-01-02|publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080204073131/http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/thewalk/history.xml.htm |archivedate = February 4, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
In 2005, the board of directors held a contest to design a new location for Canada's Walk of Fame. The winner was announced in September 2006 and that it would move to Pecaut Square, next to Roy Thomson Hall.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/09/13/walk-fame.html|title=Canada's Walk of Fame plans to shift galaxy to new site|date=2006-09-13|accessdate=2008-01-02|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] However, in 2008, negotiations with the city of Toronto fell through and Canada's Walk of Fame would not be moving, although organizers will continue to look at three locations on private land in downtown Toronto.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080604.wbuzzbreak04/BNStory/Entertainment/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20080604.wbuzzbreak04|title=New Walk of Famers revealed |author=Guy Dixon|date=2008-06-04|accessdate=2008-06-04|publisher=Globe and Mail[/tpl]

===Induction process===

Canada's Walk of Fame accepts nominations for potential inductees from the public year round, culminating with their National Nomination Promotion during the month of April. During the Promotion, after nominating, fans can enter a contest for the chance to win a VIP trip for two to attend the Canada’s Walk of Fame Awards in Toronto.  In 2000, prior to the introduction of the online voting system, over 30,000 nominations were received via letters, fax and e-mail.[tpl]cite news|title=Walk on the 'famous' side; New pathway-to-the-stars entries include William Shatner and Gordie Howe|date=2000-03-22|accessdate=2008-02-28|page=E07|publisher=The Record|author=Andrew Flynn[/tpl] Now submissions are accepted on the official Canada's Walk of Fame website and thousands of nominations are received every year, which are then sent to selection committee for consideration.
The committee then analyzes the nominees based on the following criteria: the nominee was born in Canada or has spent their formative or creative years in Canada; they have had a minimum of 10 years experience in their field; they have had a national or international impact on Canada’s Cultural heritage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/aboutus.xml.htm|title=About Us|date=2007-01-29|accessdate=2008-01-02|publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080131053116/http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/aboutus.xml.htm |archivedate = January 31, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Following the Selection Committee's evaluation, the nominees that meet all of the requirements are forwarded to the board of directors, who then select the inductees.
The process differs greatly from that of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Hollywood version allows only celebrities of the silver screen, television, radio, live theatre and singers/musicians, while Canada's Walk allows people of more diverse occupations, as listed above. While most celebrities on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are American or have achieved their fame in the United States, Canada's Walk of Fame is exclusive to Canadians. For someone to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, they must be nominated by a sponsor who must agree to field the approximately $25,000 cost of installing a star.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodchamber.net/icons/WOF-NominationForm07.pdf|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame Nomination Form|accessdate=2008-01-02|publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070211004644/http://www.hollywoodchamber.net/icons/WOF-NominationForm07.pdf |archivedate = February 11, 2007[/tpl] From there, the names are submitted to a nominating committee of five people, who pick 10-15 names to award stars to annually. The only criteria for it are: "professional achievement, longevity of five years or more, contributions to the community and the guarantee that the celebrity will attend the dedication ceremony if selected."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodchamber.net/icons/nomination.asp|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame Nomination Procedure|accessdate=2008-01-02|publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080222023922/http://www.hollywoodchamber.net/icons/nomination.asp |archivedate = February 22, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Canadian stars are inducted in an annual awards ceremony; while the Hollywood Walk of Fame rarely inducts more than two major stars at a time. Celebrities can have more than one star on the Hollywood Walk, the same celebrity can receive as many as five stars under the various categories. This does not happen with Canada's Walk of Fame, although some may have an individual star but are also included as part of a larger group, such as Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings, who have both individual stars and a star as a part of the band The Guess Who. Other notables are John Candy, Martin Short, Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara who have their own star but also were in Second City Television.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/220072|title=Catherine the great|author=Rob Salem|date=2007-06-03|accessdate=2008-01-02|publisher=Toronto Star[/tpl]

===Induction ceremony===

New inductees are inducted annually at an unveiling ceremony where their star, a stylized maple leaf, is revealed. The first was held in 1998 and only four of the twelve living inductees attended: Karen Kain, Norman Jewison, Barbara Ann Scott and Rich Little. The 2007 ceremony was held at Toronto's Hummingbird Centre, was attended by all seven inductees and was hosted by Eugene Levy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/pressreleases/releases.cfm?aid=728|title=Eugene Levy To Host 2007 Canada s Walk of Fame on CTV|date=2007-02-28|accessdate=2008-01-02|publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080109182329/http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/pressreleases/releases.cfm?aid=728|archivedate=January  9, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

==Criticism==

In 1998, Laurie Brown of the CBC criticized the Walk of Fame, calling it "just an attraction to lure tourists to theatres in the area." She claimed that it would only honour Canadians with international impact, saying "if it was truly for Canadians, then I think there would be more of a national bend to the whole thing. But I doubt I'm going to see a star on the Walk of Fame that is only a known-name here in Canada."[tpl]cite news|title=Sidewalk constellation; Walter Ostanek, Leslie Nielsen in group joining Canada's Walk of Fame  |date=2001-06-02|accessdate=2008-02-28|publisher=The Record|author=John McKay[/tpl] There has been criticism over the lack of Canadian roots of some of the inductees, such as Jack Warner, Louis B. Mayer and Mack Sennett.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/06/23/walkoffame040623.html|title=Stars come out for Walk of Fame gala |date=2004-06-23|accessdate=2008-01-02|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation[/tpl]
In September 2010, William Shatner commented on Twitter regarding damage to his star on the Walk of Fame: "I hear my star on the Canadian Walk of Fame is a bit frazzled ... but, then again, so am I. I wonder if anybody hovering around that area can tell me what’s wrong with it and what needs fixing."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/862007 |title=William Shatner tweets about damaged star on Walk of Fame|publisher= Toronto Star|accessdate=2010-09-17|date= 2010-09-16[/tpl] The family of Gordie Howe also commented on the damage to Howe's star.
