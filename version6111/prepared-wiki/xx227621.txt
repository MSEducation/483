As the curriculum evolved it sought the same aims by including  Dewey’s progressive education, integrated curriculum,  Kolb’s VAK & experiential learning,  Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences and Harvard University’s Teaching for Understanding, in order to "incorporate the positive aspects of each to fully engage all learners at all times."The Montessori Approach and the Elementary Course, International Centre for Montessori Studies Foundation, retrieved 2008-10-06 Currently it covers Montessori cycles 1 to 3 (Prep to Year 7: up to age 12).Our Curriculum, school web site, retrieved 2010-12-10
