==Season summary==

The World Championship of Drivers, fiercely contested by Jim Clark, John Surtees and Graham Hill, was decided at the Mexican Grand Prix when Hill was delayed after a collision with Lorenzo Bandini's Ferrari. Clark was forced to stop with an oil leak on the last lap, and Ferrari signalled Bandini to let Surtees through into the second place which gave him the championship by one point from Hill. Honda made a low-key debut in grand prix racing with the American driver Ronnie Bucknum, and Maurice Trintignant retired at the age of 47 after one of the longest world championship careers.
