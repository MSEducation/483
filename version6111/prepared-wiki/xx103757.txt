==History==

===2007 format change===

Beginning on September 25, 2007, the radio station began to buzz.  Initially, the stunting involved playing one song in a loop.  Each day the station added another song to the line up.  On the tenth day of the stunt program (October 4, 2007), the songs began disappearing from the rotation.  An announcement between songs also began to play, noting how many more days were left (counting down from 8 days) before the new format would be announced on October 12, 2007.
The list of songs played during the stunt were:
"American Pie" by Don McLean, "Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone" by Ella Fitzgerald, "Rehab" by Amy Winehouse, "You're A Mean One Mr. Grinch" by Thurl Ravenscroft (the voice of Tony the Tiger), "Thriller" by Michael Jackson, "Wide Open Spaces" by The Dixie Chicks, "Dirty Water" by The Standells, "Gone Country" by Alan Jackson, and "Sexyback" by Justin Timberlake.
On October 12, 2007, the stunting ended. After being absent from Cape Cod radio for more than 15 years, "Cape 104, The Cape's Hit Music Station" was relaunched. This marked the return of Steve Binder (mornings 6 am to Noon) from the original Cape 104 along with Shai Jackson (Noon to 6 pm), another Cape Cod radio local. The format initially changed from Classic Rock to Hot AC, however by the end of 2007 it had evolved into CHR as more mainstream tracks were added.

===2008 Format Changes===

On November 10, 2008, Cape 104 flipped their format to 24/7 Christmas Music for the holiday season, renaming themselves "Cape Cod's Christmas Station, Cape 104." On December 26, 2008, Cape 104 flipped their format from 24/7 Christmas Music, to Country, renaming themselves "Cape Country 104, Today's Best Country And The Legends."
