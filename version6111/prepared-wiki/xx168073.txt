==Namesake==

It was named, after much debate, after the economist John Maynard Keynes. Other names considered included Richborough, a town in Kent, and Anselm, a former Archbishop of Canterbury.Graham Martin, From Vision to Reality: the Making of the University of Kent at Canterbury (University of Kent at Canterbury, 1990) page 124 ISBN 0-904938-03-4 Appropriately the University's department of Economics is located within the building.

==College architecture==

The college was designed by different architects from Eliot and Rutherford and consequently has a very different design. With limited funds, the initial study bedrooms lacked individual wash-basins, instead having communal facilities, though common areas for groups of study bedrooms were included, a change from the Eliot and Rutherford corridors.Graham Martin, From Vision to Reality: the Making of the University of Kent at Canterbury (University of Kent at Canterbury, 1990) page 128 ISBN 0-904938-03-4
Keynes is notable for having a much clearer separation between the residential and non-residential areas than the other three colleges, with the teaching rooms and old dining hall concentrated at the front and east of the college.http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/wiki/University_of_Kent#Keynes_College
