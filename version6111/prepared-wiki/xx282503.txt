[[Spitzer resistivity]]

CATEGORIES: Electronics

Spitzer resistivity is a classical model of electrical resistivity that is based upon electron ion collisions:[tpl]cite journal| author=Trintchouk, Fedor, Yamada, M, Ji, H, Kulsrud, RM, Carter, TA| title=Measurement of the transverse Spitzer resistivity during collisional magnetic reconnection| journal=Physics of Plasmas| year=2003| volume=10| pages=319| accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal| author=Davies, JR| title=Electric and magnetic field generation and target heating by laser-generated fast electrons| journal=Physical Review E| year=2003| volume=68| number=5| pages=056404| publisher=APS| accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]
where η is the Spitzer resistivity, Z is ionization of nuclei, m is the electron mass, ε is the resistivity of free space, lnΛ is the Coulomb logarithm, kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature in kelvins.
This resistivity model was proposed by Lyman Spitzer.[tpl]cite journal| author=Forest, CB, Kupfer, K, Luce, TC, Politzer, PA, Lao, LL, Wade, MR, Whyte, DG, Wroblewski, D| title=Determination of the noninductive current profile in tokamak plasmas| journal=Physical review letters| year=1994| volume=73| number=18| pages=2444| publisher=APS| accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]
Spitzer resistivity is commonly used in plasma physics.
