In addition to the use of parentheses to specify the order of operations, both parentheses and brackets are used to denote an interval, also referred to as a half-open range. The notation [tpl]closed-open|[tpl]mvar|a[/tpl],[tpl]mvar|c[/tpl][/tpl] is used to indicate an interval from [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] to [tpl]mvar|c[/tpl] that is inclusive of [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] but exclusive of [tpl]mvar|c[/tpl]. That is, [tpl]closed-open|5, 12[/tpl] would be the set of all real numbers between 5 and 12, including 5 but not 12. The numbers may come as close as they like to 12, including 11.999 and so forth (with any finite number of 9s), but 12.0 is not included. In Europe, the notation [tpl]math|[5, 12[[/tpl] is also used for this. The endpoint adjoining the bracket is known as closed, whereas the endpoint adjoining the parenthesis is known as open. If both types of brackets are the same, the entire interval may be referred to as closed or open as appropriate. Whenever +∞ or −∞ is used as an endpoint, it is normally considered open and adjoined to a parenthesis. See Interval (mathematics) for a more complete treatment.
In quantum mechanics, chevrons are also used as part of Dirac's formalism, bra–ket notation, to note vectors from the dual spaces of the Bra [tpl]angbr|[tpl]math|A|[/tpl] and the Ket [tpl]math||B[/tpl][/tpl]. Mathematicians will also commonly write [tpl]angbr|[tpl]math|a, b[/tpl][/tpl] for the inner product of two vectors. In statistical mechanics, chevrons denote ensemble or time average. Chevrons are used in group theory to write group presentations, and to denote the subgroup generated by a collection of elements. Note that obtuse angled chevrons are not always (and even not by all users) distinguished from a pair of less-than and greater-than signs <>, which are sometimes used as a typographic approximation of chevrons.
In group theory and ring theory, brackets denote the commutator. In group theory, the commutator [tpl]math|[tpl]mvar|g[/tpl], [tpl]mvar|h[/tpl][/tpl] is commonly defined as [tpl]math|[tpl]mvar|g[/tpl] −1 [tpl]mvar|h[/tpl] −1 [tpl]mvar|g[/tpl] [tpl]mvar|h[/tpl] [/tpl]. In ring theory, the commutator [tpl]math|[tpl]mvar|a[/tpl], [tpl]mvar|b[/tpl][/tpl] is defined as [tpl]math|[tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] [tpl]mvar|b[/tpl] − [tpl]mvar|b[/tpl] [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] [/tpl]. Furthermore, in ring theory, braces denote the anticommutator where [tpl]math|[tpl]{mvar|a[/tpl], [tpl]mvar|b[/tpl][/tpl]} is defined as [tpl]math|[tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] [tpl]mvar|b[/tpl] + [tpl]mvar|b[/tpl] [tpl]mvar|a[/tpl] [/tpl]. The bracket is also used to denote the Lie derivative, or more generally the Lie bracket in any Lie algebra.
Various notations, like the vinculum have a similar effect to brackets in specifying order of operations, or otherwise grouping several characters together for a common purpose.
In the Z formal specification language, braces define a set and chevrons define a sequence.

===Accounting===

Traditionally in accounting, negative amounts are placed in parentheses.

===Law===

Brackets are used in some countries in the citation of law reports to identify parallel citations to non-official reporters. For example: Chronicle Pub. Co. v. Superior Court, (1998) 54 Cal.2d 548, Cal.Rptr. 109. In some other countries (such as England and Wales), square brackets are used to indicate that the year is part of the citation and parentheses are used to indicate the year the judgment was given. For example, National Coal Board v England 1954 AC 403, is in the 1954 volume of the Appeal Cases reports although the decision may have been given in 1953 or earlier, whereas (1954) 98 Sol Jo 176 reports a decision from 1954, in volume 98 of the Solicitor's Journal which may be published in 1955 or later.
When quoted material is in any way altered, the alterations are enclosed in brackets within the quotation. For example: Plaintiff asserts his cause is just, stating, "my causes is [tpl]bracket|sic[/tpl] just." Although in the original quoted sentence the word "my" was capitalized, it has been modified in the quotation and the change signalled with brackets. Similarly, where the quotation contained a grammatical error, the quoting author signalled that the error was in the original with "sic" (Latin for 'thus'). (California Style Manual, section 4:59 (4th ed.))

===Sports===

Tournament brackets, the diagrammatic representation of the series of games played during a tournament usually leading to a single winner, are so named for their resemblance to brackets or braces.

Braces (curly brackets) first became part of a character set with the 8-bit code of the IBM 7030 Stretch.[tpl]cite web |last=Bob |first=Bemer |title=The Great Curly Brace Trace Chase |url=http://www.bobbemer.com/BRACES.HTM |accessdate =2009-09-05 |postscript=[/tpl]
The angle brackets or chevrons at U+27E8 and U+27E9 are for mathematical use and Western languages, whereas U+3008 and U+3009 are for East Asian languages. The chevrons at U+2329 and U+232A are deprecated in favour of the U+3008 and U+3009 East Asian angle brackets. Unicode discourages their use for mathematics and in Western texts, because they are canonically equivalent to the CJK code points U+300x and thus likely to render as double-width symbols. The less-than and greater-than symbols are often used as replacements for chevrons.
