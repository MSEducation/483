Nancy Davis Reagan (born Anne Frances Robbins; July 6, 1921) is the widow of the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, and was First Lady of the United States from 1981 to 1989.
Born in New York City, her parents divorced soon after her birth and she grew up in Maryland, living with an aunt and uncle while her mother pursued acting jobs. As Nancy Davis, she was an actress in Hollywood in the 1940s and 1950s, starring in films such as Donovan's Brain, Night into Morning, and Hellcats of the Navy. In 1952, she married Ronald Reagan, who was then president of the Screen Actors Guild, and they had two children. Reagan was the First Lady of California when her husband was Governor from 1967 to 1975. In that capacity, she began work with the Foster Grandparents Program.
Nancy Reagan became First Lady of the United States in January 1981 following her husband's election. She was criticized early in his first term largely due to her decision to replace the White House china, despite its being paid for by private donations. Nancy restored a Kennedy-esque glamor to the White House following years of lax formality, and her interest in high-end fashion garnered much attention, as well as criticism. She championed recreational drug prevention causes by founding the "Just Say No" drug awareness campaign, which was considered her major initiative as first lady. Always protective of her husband, more controversy ensued when it was revealed in 1988 that she had consulted an astrologer to assist in planning the president's schedule after the 1981 assassination attempt on her husband. She had a strong influence on her husband and played a role in a few of his personnel and diplomatic decisions.
The Reagans retired to their home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California in 1989. Nancy devoted most of her time to caring for her ailing husband, diagnosed in 1994 with Alzheimer's disease, until his death in 2004. Nancy Reagan has remained active within the Reagan Library and in politics, particularly in support of embryonic stem cell research.

==Early life==

Anne Frances Robbins was born on July 6, 1921,When Nancy Davis signed with MGM, she gave her birth date as July 6, 1923, shaving two years off her age, a common practice in Hollywood (see Cannon, Governor Reagan, p. 75). This caused subsequent confusion as some sources would continue to use the incorrect birth year. at Manhattan's Sloane Hospital for Women in New York,[tpl]cite book| coauthors = John O'Connor, Geoff Barton| last1 = Powling| first1 = Anne| last2 = O'Connor| first2 = John| last3 = Barton| first3 = Geoff| title = New Oxford English| year = 1997| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 0-19-831192-3| page = 79 [/tpl]Some sources and websites erroneously list her as either being born in Flushing or being raised in Manhattan. as the only child of car salesman Kenneth Seymour Robbins (1894–1972)Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 66 and his actress wife, Edith Luckett (1888–1987).Edith Luckett at Internet Movie DatabaseEdith Luckett at Internet Broadway Database Her godmother was silent-film-star Alla Nazimova.Wills (1987), p. 182 From birth, she was commonly called Nancy.

==Acting career==

In 1940, a young Davis had appeared as a National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis volunteer in a memorable short subject shown in movie theaters to raise donations for the crusade against polio. The Crippler featured a sinister figure spreading over playgrounds and farms, laughing over its victims, until finally dispelled by the volunteer. It was very effective in raising contributions.[tpl]cite book |last= Oshinsky | first=David M.|coauthors= |title= Polio: An American Story |year=2005 |publisher=  Oxford University Press | location=New York |page= 68 |quote= | url= |isbn=  0-19-515294-8[/tpl]
Following her graduation from college, Davis held jobs in Chicago as a sales clerk in Marshall Field's department store and as a nurse's aide.  With the help of her mother's colleagues in theatre, including Zasu Pitts, Walter Huston, and Spencer Tracy, she pursued a career as a professional actress. She first gained a part in Pitts' 1945 road tour of Ramshackle Inn, moving to New York City. She landed the role of Si-Tchun, a lady-in-waiting,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1771 | title=Lute Song | publisher=Internet Broadway Database | accessdate=2007-10-18[/tpl] in the 1946 Broadway musical about the Orient, Lute Song, starring Mary Martin and a pre-stardom Yul Brynner. The show's producer told her, "You look like you could be Chinese."Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 85
After passing a screen test, she moved to California and signed a seven-year contract with Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios (MGM) in 1949; she later remarked, "Joining Metro was like walking into a dream world."Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 88  Her combination of attractive appearance – centered around her large eyes – and somewhat distant and understated manner made her hard at first for MGM to cast and publicize.Metzger, Robert Paul (1989), pp. 31–32 Davis appeared in eleven feature films, usually typecast as a "loyal housewife,"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?participantId=45332%7C115968&afiPersonalNameId=null|title=Biography for Nancy Davis|accessdate=2007-10-17 |publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc|year=2007[/tpl] "responsible young mother," or "the steady woman."Cannon, Lou (2003), pp. 75–76 Jane Powell, Debbie Reynolds, Leslie Caron, and Janet Leigh were among those that she competed with for roles at MGM.
Davis' film career began with small supporting roles in two films of 1949, The Doctor and the Girl with Glenn Ford and East Side, West Side starring Barbara Stanwyck. She played a child psychiatrist in the film noir Shadow on the Wall (1950) with Ann Sothern and Zachary Scott; her performance was called "beautiful and convincing" by New York Times critic A. H. Weiler.[tpl]cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70F1FF83E5D147B93CBA8178ED85F448585F9 | title=Another View of Psychiatrist's Task | author=A. H. Weiler (credited as "A.

She soon starred in the 1953 science fiction film Donovan's Brain; Crowther said that Davis, playing the role of a possessed scientist's "sadly baffled wife," "walked through it all in stark confusion" in an "utterly silly" film.[tpl]cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00A12FC3A5A117A93C3AB178AD85F408585F9 | title=' Donovan's Brain,' Science-Fiction Thriller, Has Premiere at the Criterion Theatre | author=Bosley Crowther | newspaper=The New York Times | date=1954-01-21 | accessdate=2007-10-20 |authorlink=Bosley Crowther[/tpl] In her next-to-last movie, Hellcats of the Navy (1957), she played nurse Lieutenant Helen Blair and appeared in a film for the only time with her husband, playing what one critic called "a housewife who came along for the ride."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.toptenreviews.com/scripts/eframe/url.htm?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dvdtalk.com%2Fdvdsavant%2Fs808hell.html|title=Hellcats of the Navy, review one|accessdate=2007-10-17 |publisher=Kleinman.com Inc|last=Erickson|first=Glenn|year=2003[/tpl] Another reviewer, however, stated that Davis plays her part well, and "does well with what she has to work with."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/hellcatsnavy.php|title=Hellcats Of The Navy, review two|accessdate=2007-10-17 |publisher=DVDVerdict|last=Harper|first=Erick|year=2003[/tpl]
Author Garry Wills believes that Davis was underrated as an actress overall because her constrained part in Hellcats was her most widely seen performance. In addition, Davis downplayed her Hollywood goals: MGM promotional material in 1949 said that her "greatest ambition" was to have a "successful happy marriage"; decades later, in 1975, she would say, "I was never really a career woman but one only because I hadn't found the man I wanted to marry. I couldn't sit around and do nothing, so I became an actress." Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon nevertheless characterized her as a "reliable" and "solid" performer who held her own in performances with better-known actors. After her final film, Davis appeared for a brief time as a guest star in television dramas such as Wagon Train and The Tall Man until 1962, when she retired as an actress.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/films.asp |title= Nancy Reagan > Her Films |accessdate=2007-03-08 |publisher= Ronald Reagan Foundation|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070812232914/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/films.asp |archivedate = August 12, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004864/|title= Nancy Davis|accessdate=September 19, 2011|publisher= The Internet Movie Database[/tpl] During her career, Davis served on the board of directors of the Screen Actors Guild for nearly ten years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sag.org/ronald-reagan|title= Screen Actors Guild Presidents |accessdate=2007-03-08 |publisher= Screen Actors Guild[/tpl] Decades later, Albert Brooks attempted to coax her out of acting retirement by offering her the title role opposite himself in his 1996 film Mother.

==Marriage and family==

During her Hollywood career, Davis dated many actors, including Clark Gable, Robert Stack, and Peter Lawford; she later called Gable the nicest of the stars she had met. On November 15, 1949, she met Ronald Reagan,Cannon, Lou (2003), pp. 77–78 who was then president of the Screen Actors Guild. Nancy had noticed that her name had appeared on the Hollywood blacklist and sought Reagan's help to maintain her employment as a guild actress in Hollywood, and for assistance in having her name removed from the list. Reagan informed her that she had been confused with another actress of the same name. The two began dating and their relationship was the subject of many gossip columns; one Hollywood press account described their nightclub-free times together as "the romance of a couple who have no vices". Ronald Reagan was skeptical about marriage, however, following his painful 1948 divorce from Jane Wyman, and he still saw other women. After three years of dating, he eventually proposed to Davis in the couple's favorite booth at the Beverly Hills restaurant Chasen's. They married on March 4, 1952 in a simple ceremony designed to avoid the press[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/golf/sns-ap-reagan-places,0,1844441.story?page=2|title= Noteworthy places in Reagan's life|accessdate=2007-04-11|date=2004-06-05|work=The Baltimore Sun[/tpl] at the Little Brown Church in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. The only people in attendance were actor William Holden, the best man, and his wife, actress Brenda Marshall, the matron of honor.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/firstladies/nr40.html |title= First Ladies: Nancy Reagan |accessdate=2007-03-08 |publisher= The White House[/tpl] The couple's first child, Patricia Ann Reagan (better known by her professional name, Patti Davis), was born on October 21, 1952. Their son, Ronald Prescott Reagan, was born six years later on May 20, 1958. Nancy Reagan also became stepmother to Maureen Reagan (1941–2001) and Michael Reagan (born 1945), the children of her husband's first marriage to Jane Wyman.
Observers described Ronald and Nancy Reagan's relationship as intimate.Beschloss, Michael (2007), p. 296 As President and First Lady, the Reagans were reported to display their affection frequently, with one press secretary noting, "They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting." Ronald often called Nancy "Mommy"; she called him "Ronnie".[tpl]cite web |url= http://web.archive.org/web/20050401080719/http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-usnanc063835985jun06,0,3872519.story?coll=ny-nationalnews-headlines |title= By Reagan's Side, but her own person |accessdate=2007-08-15 |publisher = Newsday | author = Berry, Deborah Barfield | date = June 6, 2004 [/tpl] While the President was recuperating in the hospital after the 1981 assassination attempt, Nancy Reagan wrote in her diary, "Nothing can happen to my Ronnie.

Nancy's relationship with her children was not always as close as that with her husband. She frequently quarreled with her biological children and her stepchildren. Her relationship with Patti was the most contentious; Patti flouted American conservatism and rebelled against her parents by joining the nuclear freeze movement and authoring many anti-Reagan books.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reagan/peopleevents/pande05.html|title=The Reagan Children|last=Wolf|first=Julie|accessdate=2007-10-17 |year=2000 | publisher= PBS[/tpl] The nearly 20 years of family feuding left her very much estranged from both her mother and father.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6478080/|title=Reagan daughter shares her story|author=Couric, Katie|accessdate=2009-06-04|date=November 14, 2004|publisher=MSNBC[/tpl] Soon after her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, Patti and her mother reconciled and began to speak on a daily basis.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/27/sunday/main4898395.shtml?source=RSS&attr=_4898395|date=March 27, 2009|accessdate=2009-06-04|title=Road To A Reconciliation|publisher=CBS[/tpl] Nancy's disagreements with Michael were also public matters; in 1984, she was quoted as saying that the two were in an "estrangement right now". Michael responded that Nancy was trying to cover up for the fact she had not met his daughter, Ashley, who had been born nearly a year earlier.Reagan, Nancy (1989), pp. 148–149 They too eventually made peace. Nancy was thought to be closest to her stepdaughter Maureen during the White House years, but each of the Reagan children experienced periods of estrangement from their parents.

==First Lady of California, 1967–1975==

Reagan was First Lady of California during her husband's two terms as governor. She disliked living in Sacramento, which lacked the excitement, social life, and mild climate to which she was accustomed in Los Angeles.Cannon, Lou (2003), p. 233 She first attracted controversy early in 1967, when, after four months' residence in the California Governor's Mansion in Sacramento, she moved her family into a wealthy suburb because fire officials had labeled the mansion as a "firetrap". Though the Reagans leased the new house at their expense, the move was viewed as snobbish. Nancy defended her actions as being for the good of her family, a judgment with which her husband readily agreed.Reagan, Nancy (1989), pp. 135–137 Friends of the family later helped support the cost of the leased house, while Nancy Reagan supervised construction of a new ranch-style governor's residence in nearby Carmichael.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/19/national/19mansion.html | title=Forget the White House, Schwarzenegger Needs Digs Now | author=Charlie LeDuff | newspaper=The New York Times | date=2004-11-19 | accessdate=2007-10-19[/tpl] The new residence was finished just as Ronald Reagan left office in 1975, but his successor, Jerry Brown, refused to live there. It was sold in 1982, and California governors have been living in improvised arrangements ever since.
In 1967, Nancy Reagan was appointed by her husband to the California Arts Commission,[tpl]cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F1071FF93D5E1A718DDDAE0994D9415B878AF1D3 | title=Reagan Panel Fills Arts Chief's Post After It Ousted Aide | author=Robert_Windeler |newspaper=The New York Times | date=1967-11-17 | accessdate=2007-10-18[/tpl] and a year later was named Los Angeles Times' Woman of the Year; in its profile, the Times labeled her "A Model First Lady".[tpl]cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/527764082.html?dids=527764082:527764082&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Dec+13%2C+1968&author=LYNN+LILLISTON&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%281886-Current+File%29&edition=&startpage=F1&desc=TIMES+WOMAN+OF+THE+YEAR | title=A Model First Lady | author=Lynn Lilliston | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=1968-12-13 | accessdate=2007-10-19[/tpl] Her glamour, style, and youthfulness made her a frequent subject for press photographers.Cook, Lynn and Janet LaDue (2007), pp. 110–111 As first lady, Reagan visited veterans, the elderly, and the handicapped, and worked with a number of charities. She became involved with the Foster Grandparents Program, helping to popularize it in the United States and Australia.Anthony, C.S.

==Role in 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns==

Governor Reagan's term ended in 1975, and he did not run for a third; instead, he met with advisors to discuss a possible bid for the presidency in 1976, challenging incumbent President Gerald Ford. Reagan still needed to convince a reluctant Nancy before running, however.Benze, James G. (2005), p. 32 She feared for her husband's health and his career as a whole, though she felt that he was the right man for the job and eventually approved.Loizeau, P.M. (2004), p. 64 Nancy took on a more traditional role in the campaign, holding coffees, luncheons, and talks with senior citizens. With that, she oversaw personnel, monitored her husband's schedule, and occasionally provided press conferences. The 1976 campaign included the so-called "battle of the queens", contrasting Nancy with First Lady Betty Ford. They both spoke out over the course of the campaign on similar issues, but with different approaches.Loizeau, P.M. (2004), p. 65 Nancy was particularly upset by the warmonger image that the Ford campaign had drawn of her husband.
Though he lost the 1976 Republican nomination, Reagan ran again for the presidency in 1980 and succeeded in winning the nomination and election. During this second campaign, Nancy played a very prominent role and her management of staff became more apparent.Benze, James G., Jr. (2005), p. 33 She arranged a meeting among feuding campaign managers John Sears and Michael Deaver and her husband, which resulted in Deaver leaving the campaign and Sears being given full control. After the Reagan camp lost the Iowa caucus and fell behind in New Hampshire polls, Nancy organized a second meeting and decided it was time to fire Sears and his associates; she gave Sears a copy of the press release announcing his dismissal. Her influence on her husband became particularly notable; her presence at rallies, luncheons, and receptions increased his confidence.Loizeau, P.M. (2004), p. 69

====Renovation====

Nancy Reagan became the First Lady of the United States when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as president in January 1981. Early in her husband's presidency, Reagan stated her desire to create a more suitable "first home" in the White House, as the building had fallen into a state of disrepair following years of neglect. White House aide Michael Deaver described the second and third floor family residence as having "cracked plaster walls, chipped paint and beaten up floors";Deaver, Michael (2004), p. 78 rather than use government funds to renovate and redecorate, she sought private donations.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=41 |title=First Lady Biography: Nancy Reagan|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher= National First Ladies Library[/tpl] In 1981, Nancy directed a major renovation of several White House rooms, including all of the second and third floors[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_timelines/timelines_first-ladies-40.html|title=Nancy Reagan|publisher=The White House Historical Association|accessdate=2012-01-27[/tpl] and rooms adjacent to the Oval Office, including the press briefing room.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/west-wing/press-briefing-room.htm|title=Brady Press Briefing Room|accessdate=2008-02-01|publisher=The White House Museum[/tpl] The renovation included repainting walls, refinishing floors, repairing fireplaces, and replacing antique pipes, windows, and wires.

The first lady secured the assistance of renowned interior designer Ted Graber, popular with affluent West Coast social figures, to redecorate the family living quarters.[tpl]cite news|title=Ted Graber, 80, Decorator for Reagans, Dies|accessdate=2009-07-21|date=June 12, 2000|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Nemy, Enid|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/12/us/ted-graber-80-decorator-for-reagans-dies.html[/tpl] A Chinese-pattern, handpainted wallpaper was added to the master bedroom.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/floor2/master-bedroom.htm|title=Master Bedroom|accessdate=2008-02-01|publisher=The White House Museum[/tpl] Family furniture was placed in the president's private study. The first lady and her designer retrieved a number of White House antiques, which had been in storage, and placed them throughout the mansion.
The extensive redecoration was paid for by private donations. Many significant and long-lasting changes occurred as a result of the renovation and refurbishment, of which Nancy Reagan said, "This house belongs to all Americans, and I want it to be something of which they can be proud." The renovations received some criticisms for being funded by tax-deductible donations, meaning some of it eventually did indirectly come from the tax-paying public.Loizeau, P.M. (2005), p. 93

====Fashion====

Another of Nancy Reagan's trademarks was her interest in fashion. While her husband was still president-elect, press reports speculated about Nancy's social life and interest in fashion.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2GFQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vVgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6976,3582744|title=Nancy Reagan To Run The White House In Grand Style, Social Pundits Say|date=November 13, 1980|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=St. Petersburg Independent|page=5A[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0D1FFF3C5512728DDDA00894D9415B8084F1D3|title=Word From Friends: A New White House Style Is on the Way|date=November 9, 1980|author=Nemy, Enid|newspaper=The New York Times|page=80[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XlANAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yW0DAAAAIBAJ&dq=nancy%20reagan%20fashion&pg=5805%2C4581550|title=Fashion Designers Look Ahead to '81|date=December 23, 1980|author=Proven, Grace|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=18[/tpl] In many press accounts, Nancy's sense of style was favorably compared to that of previous First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.Burns, Lisa (2008), p. 148 Friends and those close to her remarked that, while fashionable like Kennedy, she would be different from other first ladies; close friend Harriet Deutsch was quoted as saying, "Nancy has her own imprint."
Nancy Reagan's wardrobe consisted of dresses, gowns, and suits made by luxury designers, including James Galanos, Bill Blass and Oscar de la Renta. Her white, hand-beaded, one shoulder Galanos 1981 inaugural gown was estimated to cost $10,000, while the overall price of her inaugural wardrobe was said to cost $25,000.[tpl]cite news|author=Bennetts, Leslie|title=Nancy Reagan's inaugural wardrobe gives notice of new White House opulence|date=January 25, 1981|agency=The New York Times|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times[/tpl] She favored the color red, calling it "a picker-upper", and wore it accordingly. Her wardrobe included red so often that the fire-engine shade became known as "Reagan red".[tpl]cite news|url=http://img.slate.com/blogs/blogs/xxfactor/archive/2008/02/06/color-me-nancy-reagan-red.aspx|title=Color Me Nancy Reagan Red|accessdate=2012-01-27|publisher=Slate.com|date=February 6, 2008|author=Stevens, Dana[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] She employed two private hairdressers who would style her hair on a regular basis in the White House.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE0D81338F930A1575BC0A960948260|title=Washington Talk: Briefing; A Do Ado|author=King, Wayne and Warren Weaver, Jr.|date=August 23, 1986|accessdate=2008-06-18 | work=The New York Times[/tpl]
Fashion designers were pleased with the emphasis Nancy Reagan placed on clothing. Adolfo said the first lady embodied an "elegant, affluent, well-bred, chic American look", while Bill Blass commented, "I don't think there's been anyone in the White House since Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis who has her flair." William Fine, president of cosmetic company Frances Denney, noted that she "stays in style, but she doesn't become trendy."
Though her elegant fashions and wardrobe were hailed as a "glamorous paragon of chic", they were also controversial subjects. In 1982, she revealed that she had accepted thousands of dollars in clothing, jewelry, and other gifts, but defended her actions by stating that she had borrowed the clothes and that they would either be returned or donated to museums,[tpl]cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F60716FA3A5C0C758DDDA80894DA484D81 | title=For Mrs. Reagan, Gifts Mean High Fashion At No Cost | publisher=Associated Press for The New York Times | date=1982-01-16 | format=fee required | accessdate=2008-02-01[/tpl] and that she was promoting the American fashion industry.

====Elegance and formality====

Approximately a year into her husband's first term, Nancy Reagan explored the idea of ordering new state china service for the White House.[tpl]cite news|author=Santini, Maureen|title=Nancy Reagan's White House china: $209,508|date=September 12, 1981|work=Associated Press, published in The St. Petersburg Times[/tpl] A full china service had not been purchased since the Truman administration in the 1940s, as only a partial service was ordered in the Johnson administration. She was quoted as saying, "The White House really badly, badly needs china." Working with Lenox, the primary porcelain manufacturer in America, the first lady chose a design scheme of a red with etched gold band, bordering the scarlet and cream colored ivory plates with a raised presidential seal etched in gold in the center. The full service comprised 4,370 pieces, with 19 pieces per individual set.  The service totaled $209,508.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.lenox.com/index.cfm?ss=services&cat=about&lp=whitehouse|title= Lenox: White House|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher= Lenox, Inc[/tpl] Although it was paid for by private donations, some from the private Knapp Foundation, the purchase generated quite a controversy, for it was ordered at a time when the nation was undergoing an economic recession.Klapthor, Margaret Brown (1999), p. 184
The new china, White House renovations, expensive clothing, and her attendance at the wedding of Charles and Diana, Prince and Princess of Wales,[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/diana/background/wedding1.htm|title=Britain Celebrates, Charles Takes a Bride|accessdate=2007-11-16 |publisher= The Washington Post|date=1981-07-30|author=Downie, Leonard Jr.[/tpl]  gave her an aura of being "out of touch" with the American people during an economic recession. This and her taste for splendor inspired the derogatory nickname "Queen Nancy". While Jacqueline Kennedy had also faced some press criticism for her spending habits, Reagan's treatment was much more consistent and negative.  In an attempt to deflect the criticism, she self-deprecatingly donned a baglady costume at the 1982 Gridiron Dinner and sang "Second-Hand Clothes", mimicking the song "Second-Hand Rose".[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-06-13-nancy-reagan_x.htm|title= Husband's Past will shape Nancy Reagan |accessdate=2007-03-08 |publisher= USA Today|date=2004-06-13|author=Page, Susan[/tpl] The skit helped to restore her reputation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/19/local/me-deaver19?pg=4|page=5|title=Michael K.

Nancy Reagan reflected on the criticisms in her 1989 autobiography, My Turn. Reagan describes lunching with former Democratic National Committee chairman Robert Strauss, wherein Strauss said to her, "When you first came to town, Nancy, I didn't like you at all. But after I got to know you, I changed my mind and said, 'She's some broad!'" Nancy responded, "Bob, based on the press reports I read then, I wouldn't have liked me either!"Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 56
After the presidencies of Gerald Ford (who favored the Michigan fight song over "Hail to the Chief") and Jimmy Carter (who dramatically reduced the formality of presidential functions), Nancy brought a Kennedy-esque glamour back into the White House.[tpl]cite news |first= Kevin|last= West|title= Nancy's Closet|url=http://www.wmagazine.com/society/2007/10/nancy_reagan|magazine=W|accessdate=2009-05-15|date=October 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/01/18/features/ig-michelle18|author=Moore, Boothe|accessdate=2009-02-05|date=January 18, 2009|work=The Los Angeles Times|title=Can she stay 'everywoman'?[/tpl] She hosted 56 state dinners over eight years, compared to six by George and Laura Bush.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/nancy-reagan-i-still-see-ronnie-in-my-bedroom-1694535.html|title=Nancy Reagan: I still see Ronnie in my bedroom|author=Usborne, David|date=June 2, 2009|accessdate=2009-06-03|work=The Independent | location=London[/tpl] She remarked that hosting the dinners is "the easiest thing in the world. You don't have to do anything. Just have a good time and do a little business. And that's the way Washington works." In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev became the first Soviet leader to visit Washington, D.C. since Nikita Khrushchev in 1959, and Nancy Reagan was in charge of planning and hosting the important and highly anticipated state dinner.Schifando and Joseph (2007), p. 165 After the meal, Nancy recruited pianist Van Cliburn to sing a rendition of "Moscow Nights" for the Soviet delegation, to which Mikhail and Raisa broke out into song.Schifando and Joseph (2007), pp. 169–172  Former Secretary of State George Shultz commented on the evening, saying "We felt the ice of the Cold War crumbling."Schifando and Joseph (2007), p. 175 Nancy concluded, "It was a perfect ending for one of the great evenings of my husband's presidency."Schifando and Joseph (2007), p. 173

===Just Say No===

Nancy Reagan launched the "Just Say No" drug awareness campaign in 1982, which was her primary project and major initiative as first lady. Nancy first became aware of the need to educate young people about drugs during a 1980 campaign stop in Daytop Village, New York. She remarked in 1981 that "Understanding what drugs can do to your children, understanding peer pressure and understanding why they turn to drugs is ... the first step in solving the problem." Her campaign focused on drug education and informing the youth of the danger of drug abuse.
In 1982, Nancy Reagan was asked by a schoolgirl what to do when offered drugs; Nancy responded "Just say no."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1989/010489a.htm|title= Remarks at the Nancy Reagan Drug Abuse Center Benefit Dinner in Los Angeles, California|accessdate=2007-10-03 |publisher= Ronald Reagan Foundation |date= 1989-01-04 |quote= ...in Oakland where a schoolchild in an audience Nancy was addressing stood up and asked what she and her friends should say when someone offered them drugs. And Nancy said, "Just say no." And within a few months thousands of Just Say No clubs had sprung up in schools around the country.[/tpl]Loizeau, Pierre-Marie. Nancy Reagan: The Woman Behind the Man (1984). Nova Publishers, pp. 104–105 The phrase proliferated in the popular culture of the 1980s and was eventually adopted as the name of club organizations and school anti-drug programs. Reagan became actively involved by traveling more than [tpl]convert|250000|mi|km[/tpl] throughout the United States and several nations, visiting drug abuse prevention programs and drug rehabilitation centers. She also appeared on television talk shows, recorded public service announcements, and wrote guest articles. She appeared in an episode of the hit television drama Dynasty to underscore support for the anti-drug campaign. As she continued to promote "Just Say No", she appeared in an episode of the popular 1980s sitcom Diff'rent Strokes[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0560083/|title= 'Diff'rent Strokes': The Reporter (1983)|accessdate=2007-10-18|publisher= The Internet Movie Database[/tpl] and in a 1985 rock music video, "Stop the Madness".[tpl]cite video |people= Brian L.

In 1985, Nancy expanded the campaign to an international level by inviting the First Ladies of various nations to the White House for a conference on drug abuse. On October 27, 1986, President Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill into law, which granted $1.7 billion in funding to fight the crisis and ensured a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/cron/ | title= Thirty Years of America's Drug War | publisher = pbs.org | accessdate=2007-04-04[/tpl] Although the bill was criticized by some, Nancy Reagan considered it a personal victory. In 1988, she became the first First Lady invited to address the United Nations General Assembly, where she spoke on international drug interdiction and trafficking laws.
Critics of Reagan's efforts questioned their purpose[tpl]cite news |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n5_v25/ai_13786316/pg_3|title= Just say nonsense – Nancy Reagan's drug education programs|accessdate=2007-10-10 |publisher= Washington Monthly|date=May 1993|page= 3|author=Elliott, Jeff[/tpl] and argued that the program did not go far enough in addressing many social issues, including unemployment, poverty, and family dissolution; Nancy's approach to promoting drug awareness was labeled as simplistic by liberal critics.[tpl]cite news|publisher=PBS|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reagan/peopleevents/pande03.html|author=Wolf, Julie.|title=The American Experience: Nancy Reagan|accessdate=2008-01-22[/tpl] Nonetheless, a number of "Just Say No" clubs and organizations remain in operation around the country, and they aim to educate children and teenagers about the effects of drugs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/just_say_no.asp |title= Mrs. Reagan's Crusade |accessdate=2007-03-08 |publisher= Ronald Reagan Foundation|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070812171917/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/just_say_no.asp |archivedate = August 12, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

===Her husband's protector===

Nancy Reagan assumed the role of unofficial "protector" for her husband after the attempted assassination on his life in 1981.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/06/05/national/main621274.shtml|title=His Fierce Protector: Nancy|first=David|last=Hancock|accessdate= 2007-11-15|date= June 5, 2004|publisher=CBS[/tpl] On March 30 of that year, President Reagan and three others were shot as they left the Washington Hilton Hotel. Nancy was alerted and arrived at George Washington University Hospital, where the President was hospitalized. She recalled having seen "emergency rooms before, but I had never seen one like this—with my husband in it."Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 5 She was escorted into a waiting room, and when granted access to see her husband, he quipped to her, "Honey, I forgot to duck", borrowing the defeated boxer Jack Dempsey's jest to his wife.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/reagan.html| author=Noonan, Peggy|title= Character Above All: Ronald Reagan essay |publisher = PBS |accessdate=2007-08-15[/tpl]
An early example of her protective nature occurred when Senator Strom Thurmond entered the President's hospital room that day in March, passing the Secret Service detail by claiming he was the President's "close friend", presumably to acquire media attention.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web1.millercenter.org/poh/transcripts/ohp_2002_1024_friedersdorf.pdf|title= Final Edited Transcript: Interview with Max Friedersdorf|accessdate= 2007-10-20|date= October 24–25, 2002|format= PDF|publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs|page= 60|quote=Mrs. Reagan was all upset, of course. He said that Senator Strom Thurmond had come over to the hospital and had talked his way in, past the lobby, up to the President's room—he's in intensive care, tubes coming out of his nose and his throat, tubes in his arms and everything—and said that Strom Thurmond had talked his way past the secret service into his room and Mrs. Reagan was outraged, distraught. She couldn't believe her eyes. He said, 'You know, those guys are crazy. They come over here trying to get a picture in front of the hospital and trying to talk to the President when he may be on his deathbed.[/tpl] Nancy was outraged and demanded he leave. While the president recuperated in the hospital, the first lady slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by the scent. When Reagan was released from the hospital on April 12, she escorted him back to the White House.
Press accounts framed Nancy as her husband's "chief protector", an extension of their general initial framing of her as a helpmate and a Cold War domestic ideal.Burns, Lisa (2008), pp. 130, 138–139

===Influence in the White House===

Nancy stated in her memoirs, "I felt panicky every time Ronald left the White House"Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 21 following the assassination attempt, and made it her concern to know her husband's schedule: the events he would be attending, and with whom. Eventually, this protectiveness led to her consulting an astrologer, Joan Quigley, who offered insight on which days were "good", "neutral", or should be avoided, which influenced her husband's White House schedule.[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDF1030F93BA25750C0A966958260|title=Stars and Strife|accessdate= 2007-11-16|date= March 18, 1990|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Ivins, Molly|authorlink=Molly Ivins[/tpl] Days were color-coded according to the astrologer's advice to discern precisely which days and times would be optimal for the president's safety and success.
The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew frustrated with this regimen, which created friction between him and the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the Iran-Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president.Anthony, C.S. (1991), p. 396 She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Nancy refused to allow Reagan to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings.Anthony, C.S. (1991), p. 398 Regan became so angry with Nancy that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to former ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation.[tpl]cite video | people=Thomas, Rhys (Writer/Producer); Donaldson, Sam (interviewee)|date=2005 | title=The Presidents| medium=Documentary | publisher=A&E Television[/tpl] In his 1988 memoirs, Regan wrote about Nancy's consultations with the astrologer, the first public mention of them, which resulted in embarrassment for the First Lady.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/01/AR2007050102070.html| title=Ronald Reagan, In His Own Words| author=Kurtz, Howard| newspaper=The Washington Post | date=2007-05-02 | accessdate=2007-10-20|authorlink=Howard Kurtz[/tpl] Nancy later wrote, "Astrology was simply one of the ways I coped with the fear I felt after my husband almost died... Was astrology one of the reasons attempts did not occur? I don't really believe it was, but I don't really believe it wasn't."Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 44, p. 47
Nancy Reagan wielded a powerful influence over President Reagan. Again stemming from the assassination attempt, she strictly controlled access to the president and even occasionally attempted to influence her husband's decision making.Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 62
Beginning in 1985, Nancy strongly encouraged her husband to hold "summit" conferences with Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev, and suggested they form a personal relationship beforehand. Both Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev had developed a productive relationship through their summit negotiations. The relationship between Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev was anything but the friendly, diplomatic one between their husbands; Nancy found Raisa hard to converse with and their relationship was described as "frosty".[tpl]cite news|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-10-14|date=December 8, 1988|author=Celestine Bohlen|title= The Gorbachev Visit; Another Obstacle Falls: Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev Get Chummy|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DD1039F93BA35751C1A96E948260[/tpl] The two women usually had tea, and discussed differences between the USSR and the United States. Visiting the U.S. for the first time in 1987, Raisa irked Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism, reportedly prompting the American President's wife to quip, "Who does that dame think she is?"[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967592-1,00.html |magazine = Time| author = Chua-Eoan, Howard G. | title = My Wife Is a Very Independent Lady | date = June 6, 1988 | accessdate = 2007-10-05[/tpl]
Press framing of Nancy changed from that of just helpmate and protector to someone with hidden power.Burns, Lisa (2008), pp. 139–140 As the image of her as a political interloper grew, she sought to explicitly deny that she was the power behind the throne. At the end of her time as First Lady, however, she said that her husband had not been well-served by his staff. She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions, saying "In no way do I apologize for it."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/13/us/nancy-reagan-criticizes-aides-to-president.html | title=Nancy Reagan Criticizes Aides to President | agency=Reuters | newspaper=The New York Times | date=1988-11-13 | accessdate=2009-05-16[/tpl] She wrote in her memoirs, "I don't think I was as bad, or as extreme in my power or my weakness, as I was depicted,"Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. vii but went on, "However the first lady fits in, she has a unique and important role to play in looking after her husband. And it's only natural that she'll let him know what she thinks. I always did that for Ronnie, and I always will."Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 65

===Breast cancer===

In October 1987, a mammogram detected a lesion in Nancy Reagan's left breast and she was subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer. She chose to undergo a mastectomy rather than a lumpectomy[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9B0DE2DA123DF93BA25753C1A961948260|title=Surgeons Remove Cancerous Breast of Nancy Reagan|accessdate=2008-06-23|work=The New York Times|author=Altman, Lawrence K|date=October 18, 1987[/tpl] and the breast was removed on October 17, 1987. Ten days after the operation, her mother, Edith Luckett Davis, died in Phoenix, Arizona, leading Nancy to dub the period "a terrible month".Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 285
After the surgery, more women across the country had mammograms, an example of the influence the First Lady possessed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001360.htm|title=Perspectives in Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Trends in Screening Mammograms for Women 50 Years of Age and Older — Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 1987|accessdate=2008-06-23|date=March 10, 1989|publisher=Department of Health and Human Services[/tpl]

==Subsequent life==

Though Nancy was a controversial First Lady, 56 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of her when her husband left office on January 20, 1989, with 18 percent having an unfavorable opinion and the balance not giving an opinion.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/06/07/opinion/polls/main621632.shtml|title=A Look Back At The Polls|accessdate=2007-10-14|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|date=June 7, 2004[/tpl]  Compared to fellow First Ladies when their husbands left office, Reagan's approval was higher than those of Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Rodham Clinton, however she was less popular than Barbara Bush and her disapproval rating was double that of Carter's.
Upon leaving the White House, the couple returned to California, where they purchased a home in the wealthy East Gate Old Bel Air neighborhood of Bel Air, Los Angeles,[tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-12-04/news/vw-1262_1_nancy-reagan/8 | title= The Reagan Re-Entry: After Years in the Capital Fishbowl, the First Couple Hope to Find a Little Calm in a Much Changed L.A. | author=Beyette, Beverly | author2=Cuniberti, Betty | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=December 4, 1988[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last = Stevens| first = Pam| title =Reagan paid back his friends for house they bought for him| publisher =CNN| date = January 21, 2001| url =http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/26/reagan.house/index.html|accessdate = 2007-11-16[/tpl] dividing their time between Bel Air and the Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara, California; Ronald and Nancy regularly attended Bel Air Presbyterian Church as well.[tpl]Cite news| last = Netburn| first = Deborah| title =Agenting for God | newspaper = Los Angeles Times| date = December 24, 2006| url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1185261551.html?dids=1185261551:1185261551&FMT=ABS| accessdate = 2007-11-16[/tpl] After leaving Washington, Nancy made numerous public appearances, many on behalf of her husband.

===Early post-White House activities===

In late 1989, the former First Lady established the Nancy Reagan Foundation, which aimed to continue to educate people about the dangers of substance abuse.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/nancy_bio.asp|title= Nancy Reagan: Her Life and Times|accessdate= 2007-05-12|publisher= Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071112053844/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/nancy_bio.asp |archivedate = November 12, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The Foundation teamed with the BEST Foundation For A Drug-Free Tomorrow in 1994, and developed the Nancy Reagan Afterschool Program. She continued to travel around the nation, speaking out against drug and alcohol abuse. After President Reagan revealed that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, she made herself his primary caregiver and became actively involved with the National Alzheimer's Association and its affiliate, the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute in Chicago, Illinois.
Also in 1989 she published My Turn: The Memoirs of Nancy Reagan, which gives an account of her life in the White House, speaking openly about her influence within the Reagan administration and discussing the myths and controversies that surrounded the couple.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.a1wdb.com/cgi-bin/women/11521.html|title=My Turn Review|accessdate=2007-03-28 |publisher=A-1 Women's Discount Bookstore[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl] In 1991, the controversial author Kitty Kelley wrote an unauthorized and largely uncited biography about Nancy Reagan, repeating accounts of a poor relationship with her children and introducing rumors of alleged sexual relations with singer Frank Sinatra.

W. Bush as well as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to speak during the National Cathedral Service. She paid very close attention to the details, something she had always done in her husband's life. Betsy Bloomingdale, one of Reagan's closest friends, stated, "She looks a little frail. But she is very strong inside. She is. She has the strength. She is doing her last thing for Ronnie. And she is going to get it right." The funeral marked her first major public appearance since delivering a speech to the 1996 Republican National Convention on her husband's behalf.
The funeral had a great impact on Reagan's public image. Following substantial criticism during her tenure as first lady, she was seen somewhat as a national heroine, praised by many for supporting and caring for her husband while he suffered from Alzheimer's disease.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3794125.stm|title=Nancy Reagan emerges as public icon|publisher=BBC News|date=2004-06-10 |accessdate=2007-11-02[/tpl] U.S. News & World Report opined, "after a decade in the shadows, a different, softer Nancy Reagan emerged."[tpl]cite news|title=A warm public embrace for the new Nancy|accessdate=2008-12-13|author=Cannon, Angie|work=US News and World Report|date=June 21, 2004|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/reagan/articles/21nancy.htm[/tpl]

===Widowhood===

Reagan has remained active in politics, particularly relating to stem cell research. Beginning in 2004, she favored what many consider to be the Democratic Party's position, and urged President George W. Bush to support federally funded embryonic stem cell research in the hope that this science could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's disease.[tpl]cite journal | author = Erika Check | title = Bush pressured as Nancy Reagan pleads for stem-cell research | journal = Nature | year = 2004 | volume = 429 | page = 116| doi = 10.1038/429116a | pmid = 15141173 | issue = 6988[/tpl] Although she failed to change the president's position, she did support his campaign for a second term.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-08-03-nancy-reagan-bush_x.htm|title= Former first lady Nancy Reagan supports Bush's re-election|accessdate=2007-10-17 |newspaper=USA Today| date = August 4, 2004[/tpl]

Asked what her plans were, Reagan shook her head and responded, "I don't know. I'll know when I'll know. But the Reagan library is Ronnie, so that's where I spend my time."
In 2007, she attended the national funeral service for Gerald Ford in the Washington National Cathedral. Nancy Reagan hosted two 2008 Republican Presidential Candidates Debates at the Reagan Presidential Library, the first in May 2007 and the second in January 2008. While she did not participate in the discussions, she sat in the front row and listened as the men vying to become the nation's 44th president claimed to be a rightful successor to her husband.[tpl]cite news|date=May 4, 2007|author=Nagourney, Adam|coauthors= Santora, Marc|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/us/politics/04repubs.html?hp|title= '08 Republicans Differ on Defining Party's Future|publisher= The New York Times|accessdate=2007-05-04[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://youdecide08.foxnews.com/2008/01/30/romney-mccain-out-of-step-with-conservative-mainstream/|publisher=Fox News|date=2008-01-30|accessdate=2008-02-01|title=Romney Blasts McCain over Iraq War Charge|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080201084303/http://youdecide08.foxnews.com/2008/01/30/romney-mccain-out-of-step-with-conservative-mainstream/ |archivedate = February 1, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/one-word-reagan/ | title=One Word: Reagan | author=Phillips, Kate | work=The New York Times | date=2008-01-31 | accessdate=2008-02-09[/tpl] Though some speculation arose as to whether Reagan might support New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a presidential bid,[tpl]cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081014085042/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=3860870|title=Bloomberg Hosts Event with Nancy Reagan|date=2007-11-13|agency=Associated Press|author=Kugler, Sara|publisher=ABC|accessdate=2008-01-20[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Bloomberg Turns to Reagan|url=http://www.nysun.com/new-york/bloomberg-turns-to-reagan/66254/|author=Rauh, Grace|date=2007-11-12|accessdate=2008-01-20|work=The New York Sun[/tpl] nothing came of it.

Nancy Reagan's health and well-being became a prominent concern in 2008. In February she suffered a fall at her Bel Air home and was taken to St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California.

It is so important for folks in her age bracket and in her bracket of life to remain upright and captain of their own ship. She very much is captain of her own ship." As for her mental ability, Williams remarked, "She's as sharp as ever and enjoys a robust life with her friends in California, but falling is always a danger of course. She's a very stoic, hardy person full of joy and excitement for life... She is not without opinions on politics and political types these days... She is, as most of her friends described her, a pistol."
In October 2008, Reagan was admitted to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after falling at home. Doctors determined that the 87-year-old had fractured her pelvis and sacrum and could recuperate at home with a regimen of physical therapy.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE49G7S420081017 | publisher=Reuters | title=Former first lady Nancy Reagan out of hospital | first=Dan | last=Whitcomb | date=2008-10-17 | accessdate=2009-05-14[/tpl] As a result of her mishap, medical articles were published containing information on how to prevent falls.[tpl]cite news|title=Steps to take for strong bones|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/living/story/754530.html|work=The Miami Herald|accessdate=2008-12-06|author=Rarback, Sheah|date=November 4, 2008[/tpl] [tpl]dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/126942.php|title=Physical Therapy Will Play Key Role In Nancy Reagan's Recovery From Recent Fall|accessdate=2008-12-06|publisher=News Today|date=October 27, 2008[/tpl] In January 2009, Reagan was said to be "improving every day and starting to get out more and more."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/69715_Nancy_Reagan_Health_Update_She_s_Improving_Every_Day/index.html|title=Nancy Reagan Health Update: 'Shes Improving Every Day'|accessdate=2009-01-20|date=January 15, 2009|publisher=Entertainment Tonight[/tpl]
