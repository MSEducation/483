Dave Clarke (born 19 September 1968)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Dave+Clarke |title=Dave Clarke |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=6 June 2009[/tpl] is an English techno DJ, producer and radio presenter. BBC radio presenter John Peel named Clarke "The Baron of Techno".

==Early life==

Born in Brighton, England, United Kingdom (UK), Clarke was educated at Brighton College, but ran away from home at the age of 16 after his parents separated. After a brief period of homelessness, a friend offered him temporary accommodation and Clarke continued to develop his love for music—initially hip hop and post-punk. The Damned was an early influence for Clarke and he continues to listen to the band during his music career:
 
 I bought my first Damned album because I thought they sounded like theyd be really evil, he declares, and even now their album Machine Gun Etiquette is one I keep coming back to. I like the attitude, the free reign of it, and on an artistic level I see my music as in the alternative genre rather than dance music. Techno and electro is an alternative that happens to be on the peripheries of dance music.[tpl]cite web|title=DJ Dave Clarke|url=http://www.djguide.nl/djinfo.p?djid=129|work=DJ Guide|publisher=DJ Guide|accessdate=19 April 2014|author=Thomas H. Green|language=English and Dutch[/tpl]
During this period, his employment included a low-paying job in a shoe shop; however, his musical ambitions were established at this stage of his life: "I used to tell people when I was working in a shoe shop that I would one day travel the world based on a career in music... I was that driven."[tpl]cite web|title=Dave Clarke|url=http://www.dmcworld.net/features/entry/features/dave-clarke.html|work=dmcworld magazine|publisher=DMC Limited|accessdate=19 April 2014|year=2013[/tpl] Musical success began when he attained a DJ residency at the Brighton nightclub "Toppers", which rivalled a club night run by John Digweed (then known as DJ JD). Clarke later explained that he regarded the period "as an apprenticeship".
Clarke's music reviews were also published in the now-defunct DMC Update magazine and he reviewed the inaugural single by Aphex Twin. Clarke acknowledged in 2013, "having my reviews in there Update'' helped me to get the vinyls I needed to be out there DJing."

==Career==

Clarke's musical career commenced as a producer and his first release was under the moniker "Hardcore" on the XL Recordings label in 1990. The release occurred two years after he played his first international show at the now-defunct "Richters" venue in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The XL release gained the attention of Belgian techno music label R&S Records and he subsequently released various EPs in 1991 as both Hardcore and "Directional Force".[tpl]cite web|title=Dave Clarke Bio|url=https://myspace.com/daveclarkedj/bio|work=Dave Clarke DJ on Myspace|publisher=Myspace LLC|accessdate=19 April 2014|year=2014[/tpl]
In 1992 Clarke launched his own music label, "Magnetic North", releasing recordings under the moniker "Fly By Wire". He then produced a series of EPs under the name "Red", one of which was listed by the DJ Mag publication in its "All Time Techno Top 100" list. The Red recordings led to a significant level of attention for Clarke, who subsequently produced remixes for prominent artists such as Kevin Saunderson’s "Inner City", The Chemical Brothers, New Order and Underworld.
Signed to the de-Construction label, Clarke then released his debut album, Archive One, in 1996, which contained elements of the breakbeat and electronica genres. Clarke is one of the few DJs who performed live on Peel's radio show and segments of the performance were released as the The John Peel Session EP on the Strange Fruit label in 1997, under the name "Directional Force".[tpl]cite web|title=Dave Clarke - Directional Force – The John Peel Session|url=http://www.discogs.com/Dave-Clarke-Directional-Force-The-John-Peel-Session/release/6206|work=Dave Clarke on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=19 April 2014|year=2014[/tpl] Also in 1997, Peel identified Archive 1 as number 14 in a list of his top 20 albums at the time.[tpl]cite news|title=The Peel detective|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/oct/12/johnpeel.popandrock|accessdate=19 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 October 2005|author=Jon Dennis[/tpl]
Clarke then released a series of DJ mix albums, including two World Service sets, released on the React Records label at the beginning of the 21st century. One of the albums sold over 100,000 copies, while World Service Vol. 1 was ranked number 9 in the Resident Advisor (RA) magazine poll of best mix albums from the 2000-2009 period. In response to the RA ranking, Clarke stated:
 
 There was a general frustration for me at the time that I started putting World Service together that there was so much good electro and techno coming out at the time, and I didn't want to do just one specific genre on a mix. I wanted it to be a continuation of my radio show—similar to the BBC's World Service—available to everyone around the globe. While I think I prefer the electro mix from World Service 2, there are so many great tracks on the first.[tpl]cite web|title=RA Poll: Top 50 mixes of the '00s|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1143|work=Resident Advisor|publisher=Resident Advisor Ltd|accessdate=19 April 2014|date=27 January 2010[/tpl]
The album Devil's Advocate, released in 2004, was Clarke's output during a brief period with the Skint music label and featured collaborations with Chicks on Speed, Mr Lif and DJ Rush. In 2006 Clarke launched his weekly radio program, "White Noise", on Dutch radio broadcaster VPRO (3FM).[tpl]cite web|title=SMART BAR TALKS TO DAVE CLARKE|url=http://smartbarchicago.com/smart-bar-talks-to-dave-clarke|work=Smart Bar|publisher=Smart Bar|accessdate=19 April 2014|date=15 March 2013[/tpl]
Clarke relocated to Amsterdam in 2008,[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] explaining in 2013 that he "just couldn't grow there England anymore." Following Clarke's performance at Richter in the 1980s, he states that he "fell in love with the place and hoped one day to live" in the city. Clarke commended Amsterdam in 2013, as it "has so many great things, an amazing way of life in the most beautiful setting with a bloody great big and reliable airport 15 mins away."
In 2011 Clarke started a new project called "_Unsubscribe_" with Jonas Uittenbosch (aka Mr. Jones), after they met in Ultrecht, the Netherlands. They have remixed artists such as Ben Sims, Detroit Grand Pubahs and Boys Noize. In May 2013 their debut single, "Spek Hondje", appeared on the Houndstooth label—prior to this, Clarke had not recorded in a studio for six years.[tpl]cite web|title=_Unsubscribe_ - Spek Hondje|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/review-view.aspx?id=13024|work=Resident Advisor|publisher=Resident Advisor Ltd|accessdate=19 April 2014|author=Carlos Hawthorn|date=10 June 2013[/tpl]
Since relocating to Amsterdam, Clarke founded the "Dave Clarke Presents" event moniker that, as of 2013, appeared on eight sold-out occasions at the annual Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE) and hosted the second-biggest outdoor stage at the Tomorrowland 2012 festival in Belgium; Dave Clarke Presents returned for Tomorrowland 2013. Clarke has also appeared at other prominent festival events, such as Awakenings, Glastonbury, Pukkelpop and Nature One.
As of 2013, Clarke's DJ presence at clubs includes Fabric in London, UK, Berghain in Berlin, Germany, and Fuse in Brussels, Belgium. In a 2013 interview, Clarke explained that Fabric and the "celtic side" (Ireland and Scotland) were solely responsible for quality electronica in the UK region:
 
 But yes, the scene is cheesy in the UK, why do I think this...well I blame one person: Pete Tong, the driver of big business into UK radio. That is my interpretation anyway. Also the sad demise of record shops didn't help sustain a healthy disdain to the commerciality so omnipresent in the UK. Yes, Fabric kicks the crap away with an amazing stance for quality week in week out, but you mostly have to go to the celtic side to get back the punky attitude, Scotland, Ireland...
Clarke performed at the Smart Bar in Chicago, United States (US) in November 2013, which was his first American live show in around eight years. Clarke explained in a promotional interview that "shiesty promoters not being professional and honouring legal commitments" were responsible for his protracted absence. In the same interview, Clarke also provided his perspective on US electronica:
 
 That is strange for me, the US invents house and electro, digests European electronica and comes up with Techno, yet never understands the culture it gave Europe and the World and doesn’t treat these innovators with any deep respect or understanding above cult status, that is a dilemma I cannot fathom.
As of 19 April 2014, 433 editions of "White Noise" have been broadcast and the program has moved VPRO (3FM) to the Irish station RTÉ 2fm.[tpl]cite web|title=White Noise Sat / Sun Midnight|url=http://www.rte.ie/2fm/white-noise/programmes/2014/0418/609692-whitenoise-433/|work=RTÉ 2fm|publisher=RTÉ Commercial Enterprises Ltd|accessdate=19 April 2014|date=18 April 2014[/tpl] Clarke explained in 2013 that the radio show "really is my way of paying back the scene."
Clarke was featured in the April 2014 edition of Mixmag magazine, in which he states: "EDM is a vehicle for ego-centric artists to expand their wallets".[tpl]cite web|title=8:14 PM|url=https://twitter.com/DJDaveClarke/status/457145083377516544|work=DJDaveClarke on Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=19 April 2014|author=Dave Clarke|date=18 April 2014[/tpl]

===DJ equipment===

Clarke stopped playing vinyl in clubs at the end of the 2004,Trackitdown.net and began played digital files on CD (his players of choice were the Technics DZ1210).Panasonic.com In mid-2006, he then used the Technics DZ1210 in conjunction with Serato Scratch Live—with an SL3 converter—but also uses Pioneer CDJs or Denon CD DJ players (DJ SC2900), the latter of which he helped develop.Denon Youtube-channel

==Personal life==

In 2013 Clarke explained that his experience as a professional DJ was a combination of "ups and downs":
 
 ...  the travelling is tough, the lack of sleep is a killer (3-4 hours over 2-3 days), giving up your weekends for 25 years needs understanding from friends and family, being dead tired on a Tuesday is really a bummer, being in cars for hours on end when you want/need to sleep can drive you mad, being in a club when people really get you and all is syncopated is pure magic ...
Clarke also described an ideal Sunday in his life at the time: "Getting home at 8am, my lovely girlfriend cooking me breakfast after I have a bath, sleeping for four hours, then going for a walk together to a record shop, then a steaming hot curry. That is heaven."
