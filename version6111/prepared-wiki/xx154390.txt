Robinswood Hill ([tpl]gbmapping|SO840150[/tpl]) is a hill and country park to the south of the city centre of Gloucester, close to the Stroud Road (A4173). It rises to 650Â ft (198 m), and is owned and managed by Gloucester City Council's Countryside Unit. The Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust also has its head office based here.
It was originally one of the main sources of water to the city.Augustine Henry, "Forests Woods and Trees in Relation to Hygiene", Constable, 1852, p.220  The springs rising on Robin's Wood Hill were used by Gloucester Abbey in the 13th century.Gloucester: Public services, "A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 4: The City of Gloucester" (1988), pp. 262-269. http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42308 Date accessed: 15 May 2009  Reservoirs were built by the Gloucester Water Company in 1837-8 and taken over by the City in 1855.  Robinswood Hill ceased to provide water supply in 1924 but the reservoirs remained in use for storage until 1946; they have now been backfilled to provide carparks and a countryside centre for the thousands of visitors that use the hill for recreation and inspiration.
It is home to much wildlife and affords spectacular views of the surrounding area including other hills of Gloucester, the Cotswolds, Malvern Hills, May Hill and on a clear day the Severn Bridges.
The country park itself is a [tpl]convert|100|ha|adj=on[/tpl] site. On the other side of the Hill is a dry ski slope and golf course complex.
