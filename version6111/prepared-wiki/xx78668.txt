[[UserLinux]]

CATEGORIES: Debian-based distributions, Discontinued Linux distributions

UserLinux was a project to create an operating system based on Debian, and targeted at business customers. The goal was to provide businesses with a freely available, high quality operating system accompanied by certifications, service, and support options.
The project was initiated by Bruce Perens in late 2003. With the success of Ubuntu since 2005 which had the same aims, the project stalled. As of 2006, the project has not been able to ship any software, and all activity has ceased.
