Worldwide, lung cancer is the most common cancer in terms of both incidence and mortality. In 2008, there were 1.61 million new cases, and 1.38 million deaths due to lung cancer. The highest rates are in Europe and North America.[tpl]cite journal | last=Ferlay | first=J | coauthors=Shin HR, Bray F et al. |title=Estimates of worldwide burden of cancer in 2008: GLOBOCAN 2008 | journal=International Journal of Cancer | date=December 2010 | volume=127 | issue=12 | pages=2893–2917 | pmid=21351269 | doi=10.1002/ijc.25516[/tpl] The population segment most likely to develop lung cancer is people aged over 50 who have a history of smoking. In contrast to the mortality rate in men, which began declining more than 20 years ago, women's lung cancer mortality rates have been rising over the last decades, and are just recently beginning to stabilize. In the USA, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is 8% in men and 6% in women.

Eastern Europe has the highest lung cancer mortality among men, while northern Europe and the US have the highest mortality among women. In the United States, black men and women have a higher incidence.National Cancer Institute; SEER stat fact sheets: Lung and Bronchus.

From the 1960s, the rates of lung adenocarcinoma started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This is partly due to the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.[tpl]cite journal | last=Kadara | first=H | coauthors=Kabbout M, Wistuba II | title=Pulmonary adenocarcinoma: a renewed entity in 2011 | journal=Respirology | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=50–65 |date=January 2012 | pmid=22040022 | doi=10.1111/j.1440-1843.2011.02095.x [/tpl]

==History==

Lung cancer was uncommon before the advent of cigarette smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761. Different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810. Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s. Case reports in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912, but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of lung cancer had increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952. In Germany in 1929, physician Fritz Lickint recognized the link between smoking and lung cancer, which led to an aggressive antismoking campaign. The British Doctors Study, published in the 1950s, was the first solid epidemiological evidence of the link between lung cancer and smoking. As a result, in 1964 the Surgeon General of the United States recommended smokers should stop smoking.
The connection with radon gas was first recognized among miners in the Ore Mountains near Schneeberg, Saxony. Silver has been mined there since 1470, and these mines are rich in uranium, with its accompanying radium and radon gas. Miners developed a disproportionate amount of lung disease, eventually recognized as lung cancer in the 1870s.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Greenberg | first=M | coauthors=Selikoff IJ | title=Lung cancer in the Schneeberg mines: a reappraisal of the data reported by Harting and Hesse in 1879 | journal=Annals of Occupational Hygiene | volume=37 | issue=1 | pages=5–14 |date=February 1993 | pmid=8460878 | doi=10.1093/annhyg/37.1.5[/tpl] Despite this discovery, mining continued into the 1950s, due to the USSR's demand for uranium. Radon was confirmed as a cause of lung cancer in the 1960s.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Samet | first=JM | title=Radiation and cancer risk: a continuing challenge for epidemiologists | journal=Environmental Health | volume=10 | issue=Suppl. 1 | pages=S4 |date=April 2011 | pmid=21489214 | doi=10.1186/1476-069X-10-S1-S4 | pmc=3073196[/tpl]
The first successful pneumonectomy for lung cancer was performed in 1933. Palliative radiotherapy has been used since the 1940s. Radical radiotherapy, initially used in the 1950s, was an attempt to use larger radiation doses in patients with relatively early-stage lung cancer, but who were otherwise unfit for surgery. In 1997, continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy was seen as an improvement over conventional radical radiotherapy. With small-cell lung carcinoma, initial attempts in the 1960s at surgical resection and radical radiotherapy were unsuccessful. In the 1970s, successful chemotherapy regimens were developed.
