===Intelligence analysis===

On 13 July 1995, Bosnian Serb soldiers under General Ratko Mladic kill an estimated 8,000 Bosniak  men in Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina.  An American satellite captures the execution in preparation, but is not analyzed.  Two weeks later, a CIA U-2 photographed the graves at the site. Three weeks later, the photos were analyzed, and on 4 August 1995, a CIA report on the photos is sent to the White House.
