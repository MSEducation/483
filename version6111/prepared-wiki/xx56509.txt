The National Hurricane Center (NHC), located at Florida International University in Miami, Florida, is the division of the United States' National Weather Service responsible for tracking and predicting weather systems within the tropics between the Prime Meridian and the 140th meridian west poleward to the 30th parallel north in the northeast Pacific ocean and the 31st parallel north in the northern Atlantic ocean.  Its Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB) routinely issues marine forecasts, in the form of graphics and high seas forecasts, for this area year round, with the Ocean Prediction Center having backup responsibility for this unit.  The Technology and Science Branch (TSB) provides technical support for the center, which includes new infusions of technology from abroad.  The Chief, Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination, All Hurricanes (CARCAH) unit tasks planes, for research and operational purposes, to tropical cyclones during the Atlantic hurricane season and significant weather events, including snow storms, during winter and spring.  Research conducted to improve operational forecasts is done through the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project (HFIP) and Joint Hurricane Test Bed (JHT) initiatives.
During the Atlantic and northeast Pacific hurricane seasons, the Hurricane Specialists Unit (HSU) issues routine tropical weather outlooks for the northeast Pacific and northern Atlantic oceans.  When tropical storm or hurricane conditions are expected within 48 hours, the center issues the appropriate watches and warnings via the news media and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio. Although the NHC is an agency of the United States, the World Meteorological Organization has designated it as Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the North Atlantic and eastern Pacific, making it the central clearinghouse for all tropical cyclone forecasts and observations occurring in these areas.  If the center loses power or becomes incapacitated in some manner, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center backs tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the northeast Pacific ocean while the Weather Prediction Center backs up tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the north Atlantic ocean.

==History==

The first hurricane warning service was set up in the 1870s from Cuba with the work of Father Benito Viñes.  After his passing, hurricane warning services were assumed by the United States Signal Corp and United States Weather Bureau over the next decade, first based in Jamaica in 1898 and Cuba in 1899 before shifting to Washington, D.C. in 1902.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Weather and Forecasting|pages=617–620|title=Stepping Stones in the Evolution of a National Hurricane Policy|author=R.

This responsibility passed to regional hurricane offices in 1935, and the concept of the Atlantic hurricane season was established in order to keep a vigilant lookout for tropical cyclones during certain times of the year.  Hurricane advisories issued every six hours by the regional hurricane offices began at this time.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/90/2334/266.1.extract|journal=Science|date=1939-09-22|accessdate=2012-04-19|title=Hurricane Warnings of the U.

==Organization==

For the fiscal year of 2008, the budget for the NHC was $6.8 million.  A total of 66 people work for the NHC, with 12 of the staff composing their management.  The NHC has been one of the nine national centers which compose the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncep.noaa.gov/|title=National Centers for Environmental Prediction main webpage|author=National Centers for Environmental Prediction|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2012-08-28|accessdate=2012-10-08[/tpl]

===Hurricane Specialists Unit===

Known as the NHC from 1995 through 2010, the hurricane specialists within the hurricane specialists unit (HSU) are the chief meteorologists that predict the actions of tropical storms. The specialists work rotating eight-hour shifts from May through November, monitoring weather patterns in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific oceans. Whenever a tropical or subtropical cyclone forms, they begin to issue advisories every six hours until the storm runs its course.  Public advisories are issued more often when the storm expected to be of tropical storm or hurricane intensity threatens land.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnhcprod.shtml|title=NHC Text Product Descriptions|author=National Hurricane Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2011-09-27|accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl]  The specialists coordinate with officials in each country likely to be affected.  They forecast and recommend watches and warnings.
During the hurricane season, the HSU routinely issues their Tropical Weather Outlook product, which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones.  If systems occur outside the defined hurricane season, special Tropical Weather Outlooks will be issued.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gtwo_atl.shtml|author=National Hurricane Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|year=2011|accessdate=2011-07-09|title=Atlantic Graphical Tropical Weather Outlook[/tpl]  Backup responsibility for their northeast Pacific area resides at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC),[tpl]cite web|url=http://seagrant.soest.hawaii.edu/sites/seagrant.soest.hawaii.edu/files/csp/coastal_inundation_workshop/coastal-inund-workshop-summary-8-1-2-11.pdf|date=2011-08-01|accessdate=2012-09-26|title=CSP Pacific Island Operational Coastal Inundation Modeling Guidance Workshop Workshop Summary and Action Items|author=University of Hawai'i Manoa|publisher=University of Hawai'i Sea Grant[/tpl] and vice versa if CPHC were to have communication issues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/directives/010/archive/pd01006002a.pdf|page=4|title=National Weather Service Instruction 10-602 June 7, 2002 Operations and Services Tropical Cyclone Weather Services Program, NWSPD 10-6 Coordination, Backup, and Emergency Operations|date=2002-06-07|accessdate=2012-09-26|author=Scott Kiser|publisher=National Weather Service Headquarters[/tpl]  North Atlantic responsibilities are backed up by the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).  Routine coordination occurs at 1700 UTC each day between the Weather Prediction Center and National Hurricane Center to identify systems for the pressure maps three to seven days into the future within the tropics, and points for existing tropical cyclones six to seven days into the future.United States Department of Commerce (2006).

===Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch===

 
The Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB, formerly the Tropical Satellite Analysis and Forecast unit and the Tropical Analysis Center) is a part of the National Hurricane Center and was created in 1967.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/journals/essa_world/QC851U461967jul.pdf|page=15|title=Tropical Analysis Center|author=Staff|journal=ESSA World|publisher=Environmental Science Services Administration|date=July 1967[/tpl]  The TAFB is responsible for high seas analyses and forecasts for tropical portions of the Atlantic and Pacific between the Prime Meridian and the 140th meridian west poleward to the 30th parallel north in the northeast Pacific ocean and the 31st parallel north in the northern Atlantic ocean.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html/sfc2.shtml|title=North American Surface Analysis|publisher=National Center for Environmental Prediction|date=2011-10-12|accessdate=2012-09-09[/tpl]  Unlike the Hurricane Specialists Unit (HSU), TAFB is staffed full-time around the year. Other responsibilities of the TAFB include satellite-derived tropical cyclone position and intensity estimates, WSR-88D radar fixes for tropical cyclones, tropical cyclone forecast support, media support, and general operational support.Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch  The Ocean Prediction Center backs up TAFB in the event of a communications outage, and vice versa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opc.ncep.noaa.gov/abtopc.shtml|title=Vision and Mission Statement|author=Ocean Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2012-09-26|date=2011-08-18[/tpl]

===Technology and Science Branch===

The Technology & Science Branch (TSB) develops and transitions new tools and techniques into operations for tropical weather prediction in conjunction with other government and academic entities.   TSB created and continues development of the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting (ATCF) system, used to incorporate various data and model outputs, create and update HURDAT, and to generate tropical cyclone forecasts. The TSB provides support for NHC computer and communications systems including its website.  TSB maintains a number of statistical and dynamical models used in predicting both tropical cyclone behavior and associated weather conditions.  The Storm Surge Unit, which develops and maintains software to forecast the storm surge of tropical cyclones, is part of this branch.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutintro.shtml|title=About the National Hurricane Center|author=National Hurricane Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2012-04-20|date=2011-10-06[/tpl]  The Techniques Development and Applications Unit (TDAU) is part of TSB.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/abouttsb.shtml|title=Technology & Science Branch|author=National Hurricane Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2012-04-20|date=2012-04-03[/tpl]

===CARCAH===

The Chief, Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination, All Hurricanes (CARCAH) is a subunit of the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (Hurricane Hunters).  CARCAH's mission is to provide a point-of-contact and to coordinate all tropical cyclone operational reconnaissance requirements at NHC and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center for the North Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and the North Pacific basin east of the International Date Line in accordance with the National Hurricane Operations Plan (NHOP).  During the winter, CARCAH coordinates the Atlantic and Pacific winter storm requirements in support of the National Winter Storms Operations Plan (NWSOP).  Missions are flown in advance of the high-impact weather events forecast to affect the U.S., such as heavy snowfall, and at times when there is significant uncertainty within/between numerical weather prediction output.National Hurricane Operations Plan 2012, Appendix F.

===HLT===

The Hurricane Liaison Team (HLT) supports hurricane response through information exchange between the NHC, the National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS), and the emergency management community.  The HLT is composed of federal, state, and local emergency managers, as well as NWS meteorologists and hydrologists, who maintain open lines of communication about the progress and threat level of the storm with appropriate Federal, state, and local officials.  The team establishes and facilitates video and/or teleconferences with the NHC, FEMA and other Federal agencies, state Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs), Weather Prediction Center (HPC), Storm Prediction Center (SPC), and River Forecast Centers (RFCs).  During significant landfalling hurricanes, the President of the United States as well as affected city mayors and state governors join the daily briefing call, which occurs at noon Eastern Daylight Time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://library.stmarytx.edu/acadlib/edocs/katrinawh.pdf|title=The Federal Response to Hurricane Katrina:  Lessons Learned|author=George W.

==Research==

As part of their annual tropical cyclone activity, the agency issues a report on every tropical cyclone in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Ocean basins, which are available since 1958 and 1988, respectively. The report summarizes the synoptic history, meteorological statistics, casualties and damages, and the post-analysis best track of a storm.[tpl]cite web|author=NOAA Coastal Services Center|title=Historical Hurricane Tracks|year=|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2008-11-03|url=http://maps.csc.noaa.gov/hurricanes/reports.jsp[/tpl] The reports were formally known as Preliminary Reports up until 1999.[tpl]cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=2008 Atlantic hurricane season|year=2008|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2008-11-19|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2008atlan.shtml[/tpl]  The agency maintains archives and climatological statistics on Atlantic and Pacific hurricane history, including annual reports on every tropical cyclone, a complete set of tropical cyclone advisories, digitized copies of related materials on older storms, season summaries published as the Monthly Weather Review, and HURDAT, which is the official tropical cyclone database.[tpl]cite web|author=National Hurricane Center staff|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2011-05-10|title=NHC Archive of Hurricane Seasons|accessdate=2011-07-03|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastall.shtml[/tpl]
Programs are dedicated to improving the accuracy of tropical cyclone forecasts from the center.  The Joint Hurricane Testbed (JHT) is a joint operation between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and United States Weather Research Program to speed up the transfer of tropical cyclone-related research into forecast operations.  Since 2001, with its annual budget of between $1.0 and $1.5 million, the JHT has funded 62 initiatives, with most of them being implemented operationally.  The projects have had varied success, ranging from minor to significant advances in the way the NHC operates.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/rappaport-et-al-bams2012.pdf|pages=371–373|title=The Joint Hurricane Test Bed: Its First Decade of Tropical Cyclone Research-To-Operations Activities Reviewed|author=Rappaport, Edward N., Jiann-Gwo Jiing, Christopher W.
