Palatino is the name of a large typeface family that began as an old style serif typeface designed by Hermann Zapf initially released in 1948 by the Linotype foundry.
In 1984 Palatino was one of the typefaces originally included by Apple Computer in the Macintosh. In the early days of desktop publishing it gained great popularity until it began to be replaced by Times New Roman. In 1999, Zapf revised Palatino for Linotype and Microsoft, called Palatino Linotype. The revised family incorporated extended Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic character sets.
Under the collaboration of Zapf and Akira Kobayashi, the Palatino typeface family was expanded. Linotype released the Palatino nova, Palatino Sans, and Palatino Sans Informal families, expanding the Palatino typeface families to include humanist sans-serif typefaces. Palatino nova was released in 2005, while the others were released in 2006.
Named after 16th century Italian master of calligraphy Giambattista Palatino,[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] Palatino is based on the humanist fonts of the Italian Renaissance, which mirror the letters formed by a broad nib pen; this gives a calligraphic grace. But where the Renaissance faces tend to use smaller letters with longer vertical lines (ascenders and descenders) with lighter strokes, Palatino has larger proportions, and is considered to be a much easier to read typeface.
It remains one of the most widely used (and copied) text typefaces, has been adapted to virtually every type of technology, and is one of the ten most used serif typefaces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2011/08/the-most-popular-fonts-used-by-designers/ |title=Free fonts and premium fonts used by designers |publisher=Webdesigner Depot |date=2011-08-30 |accessdate=2013-11-26[/tpl] It is one of several related typefaces by Zapf, each showing influence of the Italian Renaissance letter forms. The group includes Palatine, Sistina, Michaelangelo Titling, and Aldus, which takes inspiration from printing types cut by Francesco Griffo c. 1495 in the print shop of Aldus Manutius.

==Palatino Linotype==

Palatino Linotype is a version of the Palatino family that incorporates extended Latin, Greek, Cyrillic characters, as well as currency signs, subscripts and superscripts, and fractions. The family includes roman and italic in text and bold weights.  It is one of the few fonts to incorporate an interrobang.

==Palatino nova==

Palatino nova is a redesigned version of Palatino, by Hermann Zapf and Akira Kobayashi. This Palatino nova typeface family includes roman and italics in the light, text, medium, and bold weights, a titling face formerly called Michelangelo Titling, and a large and small capital face called Palatino nova Imperial formerly called Sistina.Palatino nova Font Family - by Hermann Zapf, Akira Kobayashi
Palatino nova has reduced support on extended Latin, Greek, Cyrillic characters. In particular, Greek and Cyrillic is only available in Regular and Bold weight fonts. However, extended accented Latin characters, ligatures, small letter forms, symbols are available in Private Use Area block. Palatino nova Titling replaces lowercase characters with true small capitals, and the supports for Greek Extended and Cyrillic characters are reduced.
The font family was premiered on 2005-11-24,Linotype publishes Hermann Zapf's Palatino nova the same day as Hermann Zapf’s 87th birthday celebration.Linotype celebrates Hermann Zapf’s birthday and Palatino nova premiere - December, 2005

==Palatino Sans==

In Palatino Sans, the specimens shown in the preannouncement resemble Optima but have a softer, more organic feel.Preannouncement: Palatino Sans & Sans Informal Unlike the serifed counterpart, the Sans families do not have full Greek or Cyrillic characters.

===Palatino Sans Informal===

Palatino Sans Informal incorporates informal characteristics to the Palatino Sans, such as asymmetrical A, K, N, W, X, Y, w.

==Palatino Arabic==

It is a family designed by Lebanese designer Nadine Chahine and Hermann Zapf. The design is based on the Al-Ahram typeface designed by Zapf in 1956 but reworked and modified to fit the Palatino nova family. The design is Naskh in style but with a strong influence of Thuluth style.
This family only comes in 1 font, corresponding to Palatino nova Regular. It supports basic Latin, Arabic, Persian, and Urdu scripts. It also includes proportional and tabular numerals for the supported languages.

==Palatino eText (2013)==

It is a family designed by Toshi Omagari of Monotype Imaging, optimised for on-screen use. It includes larger x-height and wider spacing.Hermann Zapf
This family includes 4 fonts in 2 weights, with complimentary italics. OpenType features include case-sensitive forms, fractions, ligatures, lining/old style figures, localized forms, ordinals, superscript, small capitals.

==Availability==

Palatino has been available in all major typesetting systems over the years, including Linotype and "hot metal" versions. Certain hot metal versions of Palatino, of smaller x-height, are considered both more legible and elegant to many[tpl]who|date=June 2013[/tpl] people.
The first digitisation was done be Bitstream, which, however, refused to licence the name Palatino from Linotype, calling its version Zapf Calligraphic instead.http://www.mindspring.com/~fez/palatino/palfaq1.0.txt Since then, several foundries have produced Zapf-original versions.
Digital type foundries selling authentic versions of Palatino and derivative families are:
Due to Linotype's trademark on the name Palatino, other foundries use other names for their version of Zapf's typeface:
It should be noted that all these typefaces are authentic work by Zapf himself, whether or not they use the name Palatino due to Linotype's trademark.

==Free and Open Source versions and derivatives==

The only legal free version of the typeface is URW Palladio L. The open source community greatly extended the character sets of the fonts and releases new, updated versions under new names.

==Book Antiqua and other unauthorised versions==

Microsoft distributes a similar typeface, Book Antiqua (originally by Monotype), which is considered by  ZapfZapf, Hermann.  Alphabet Stories: a chronicle of technical development. Linotype: 2007. to be an imitation. Book Antiqua was designed as an alternative to licensing the fonts mandated by Adobe's PostScript standard. Both Book Antiqua and Arial (the alternative for Helvetica) share the original typefaces' character width, spacing and kerning properties. However, Book Antiqua resembles Palatino much more than Arial does Helvetica; indeed, the two are quite difficult to tell apart. However, discernible differences exist in the following characters:
In 1993, Zapf resigned from l'Association Typographique Internationale (ATypI) over what he viewed as its hypocritical attitude toward unauthorized copying by prominent ATypI members (namely Monotype). In the United States, the abstract design of a typeface is not protected by copyright, and can be imitated freely (unless the typeface is protected by a design patent, which is of much more limited duration and rarely applied for). Copyright protection is available for the representation of a typeface in software (a computer font), and the names of typefaces can be protected by trademark.
Microsoft has since licensed and distributes Linotype's version of Zapf's original design called Palatino Linotype in all versions of Windows since Windows 2000.Palatino Linotype - Version 5.01
Mannesmann Scangraphic distributes alternate digitisations of Palatino, called Parlament and Praxis.

==Variants and similar typefaces==

Zapf also designed Aldus, which appeared in the D. Stempel AG catalog in 1954. Both Aldus and Palatino were Zapf’s new form of old style typefaces inspired by the Renaissance. Originally intended as the book or text weight for Zapf's Palatino font family, it was instead released as a separate family.Aldus Font Family - by Hermann Zapf
Zapf Renaissance Antiqua was a newer interpretation by Zapf of the same general design, distributed by Mannesmann Scangraphic.
