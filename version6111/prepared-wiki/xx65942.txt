[[Foreign relations of Nauru]]

CATEGORIES: Foreign relations of Nauru, Nauru and the Commonwealth of Nations

Nauru, following independence from the United Kingdom, became a sovereign, independent republic on 31 January 1968. Nauru has established diplomatic relations with a number of nations, including most of its Pacific neighbors with which it maintains economic, cultural and administrative ties with its regionally.

==Membership in international organizations==

Nauru was admitted to the United Nations on 14 September 1999. Nauru's application to the United Nations was questioned by the People’s Republic of China due to Nauru's close diplomatic and trade links to Taiwan. Nevertheless, Nauru was granted UN full membership.
Nauru became a full member of the Commonwealth of Nations in May 1999. Since independence, Nauru had been a special member of the Commonwealth prior to 1999, but having fallen behind in payments, reverted to Special Member Status on 1 July 2005, with no authoritative power. It then returned to be a full member again on June 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=61413 |title=Nauru back as full Commonwealth member |date=26 June 2011 |work=Radio New Zealand International |accessdate=30 September 2011[/tpl]
Additionally outside the region, Nauru is a member or participant of the ACP (Lomé Convention),  the Alliance of Small Island States, the Asian Development Bank, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the G-77,  the International Civil Aviation Organization,  the International Olympic Committee, and the ITU
Nauru is notable for its lack of membership in several major international organizations. For example, Nauru is one of only three UN-recognized nations with a sea border that is not a member of the International Maritime Organization (the others are the Federated States of Micronesia and Niue).  Similarly, Nauru is one of only seven UN members that is not a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, one of 8 not part of the International Monetary Fund, and one of 12 not part of the International Finance Corporation. Nauru also is not a member of the International Development Association and has no society associated with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Finally, as with many other nations in Oceania, Nauru is not a member of Interpol or of the  International Hydrographic Organization.

==Membership in regional organizations==

Regional cooperation through various multilateral organizations is a key element in Nauru's foreign policy. The country also hosted the regional meeting that resulted in the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation In The Management Of Fisheries Of Common Interest whose eight signatories (including Naurua) collectively controls 25-30% of the world's tuna supply and approximately 60% of the western and central Pacific tuna supply.http://klima-tuvalu.no/2011/04/13/pacific-islands-fighting-for-their-tuna/  Additionally, Nauru is a full member of the Pacific Islands Forum, the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission,  the Pacific Regional Environment Programme and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community.

==Hosting Refugees==

In 2001 Nauru became host to approximately 867 refugees, mostly Afghan, who were intercepted while attempting to enter Australia illegally. This exchange was one of many which were collectively known as Australia's Pacific Solution. In February 2008, the last of the refugees were resettled in Australia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media/media-releases/2008/ce08014.htm |title=Last refugees leave Nauru - Immigration Media Release ce014/2008 |publisher=Minister.immi.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2010-06-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/nauru-camps-to-empty-of-last-refugees/2008/02/05/1202090410888.html |title=Departing refugees leave Nauru camps empty - National |publisher=theage.com.au |date=6 February 2008 |accessdate=2010-06-22[/tpl] Nauru reportedly received about $10 million in assistance from Australia in exchange for agreeing to house the refugees while their asylum applications are adjudicated.

==Bilateral Relations==

===Australia===

[tpl]Flagicon|Australia[/tpl][tpl]Flagicon|Nauru[/tpl]
Australia administered Nauru as a dependent territory from 1914 to 1968, and has remained one of Nauru's foremost economic and aid partners thereafter. Relations between the two countries are, at present, cordial, with Australia having committed itself to assisting Nauru's economic development.

===China (PRC and ROC)===

On 21 July 2002, then President Rene Harris of Nauru signed a joint communiqué in Hong Kong to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjb/zzjg/bmdyzs/gjlb/3407/default.htm |title=Nauru |publisher=Fmprc.gov.cn |date=6 August 2003 |accessdate=2010-06-22[/tpl]  In the document, the Government of the Republic of Nauru recognised that, "...that there is but one China in the world, that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjb/zzjg/bmdyzs/gjlb/3407/3408/t17068.htm |title=Joint Communiqué of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Nauru on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations |publisher=Fmprc.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2010-06-22[/tpl]  The declaration also contained an undertaking by Nauru to close its embassy in Taipei within one month, despite the fact Nauru had never had a diplomatic mission in Taiwan.  This move followed the PRC's promise to provide more than $130 million USD in aid.
That same day, the Republic of China government issued an ultimatum, demanding that the communiqué be withdrawn within 24 hours or it would take the initiative and sever ties.  There was much dissension within the Nauruan government over the move by Harris, which the President was alleged to have made on his own initiative. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] In the confusion, the Nauruan government did not respond to the ultimatum, which was extended an additional 24 hours, and the ROC followed through with its threat, breaking ties that had existed since 1980 on 23 July 2002.  In 2003, Nauru closed its embassy in Beijing, prompting speculation of an imminent resumption of ties with the ROC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/archive/detail.asp?cat=1&id=39888 |title=Nauru shuts Beijing embassy, eyes renewed ties with Taiwan |publisher=The China Post |date=2 August 2003 |accessdate=2010-06-22[/tpl]
In April 2005, during a state visit to the Marshall Islands, ROC President Chen Shui-bian met and spoke with the Nauruan President Ludwig Scotty. On 14 May 2005, the two countries signed the necessary documents to restore formal ties and reopen embassies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/archive/detail.asp?cat=1&id=62437 |title=ROC restores ties with Nauru after 3 years |publisher=The China Post |date=15 May 2005 |accessdate=2010-06-22[/tpl] The People's Republic of China consequently severed ties two weeks later on 31 May.

This led to the creation of a Cuba-Nauru Joint Intergovernmental Commission for Economic Cooperation.Economy[tpl]dead link|date=June 2010[/tpl] At approximately this time, Nauru-US relations underwent tensions for reasons which were not completely clear (See also: Foreign relations of Nauru#Ties with the United States of America, above).
In September 2008, Nauru's foreign minister attended the first Cuba-Pacific Islands ministerial meeting in Havana, aimed at "strengtening cooperation" between Nauru and Cuba, notably on coping with the impact of climate change."Kiribati's Tong Meets Castro, Heads To UN", Pacific Magazine, 18 September 2008"1st Cuba-Pacific Islands Ministerial Meeting opens in Havana", Xinhua, 16 September 2008

===United States===

[tpl]Flagicon|United States[/tpl][tpl]Flagicon|Nauru[/tpl]
The Nauruan government has a very complex relationship with the United States; the government of Bernard Dowiyogo agreed to stop passport sales and offshore banking in return for an extensive aid package. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] However, that aid has not been delivered and Nauru's formal and traditional leaders are now looking to Japan and China for assistance. According to the U.S. Department of State, Nauru has cordial relations with the United States[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/16447.htm#relations |title=Nauru |publisher=State.gov |date=19 January 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-22[/tpl]

In September 2007, David Adeang, Nauru's Foreign Minister, made a number of public statements in relation to the United States. He extolled Cuba and criticized US foreign policy, during a visit to the Caribbean island.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B024A0C98-99F7-4CEA-92F2-B6F13A3A4A60%7D)&language=EN |title=Noticias de Prensa Latina - Inicio |publisher=Plenglish.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=2010-06-22[/tpl]  Subsequently, the US Department of State, referring to events investigated in 2007, reported criticism of Adeang in its Human Rights Report, issued for 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eap/119050.htm |title=2008 Human Rights Report: Nauru |publisher=State.gov |date=25 February 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-22[/tpl]  This criticism was included in the State Department's report, despite the fact that police, having undertaken an investigation of allegations of wrongdoing, made no attempt to prosecute Adeang. Shortly after Adeang's public pronouncements, a crisis, with himself at the centre, led to the collapse of President of Nauru Ludwig Scotty's government.
Trade between the United States and Nauru is limited by the latter's small size and economic problems. The value of two-way trade in 2005 was US$1.6 million.

==Relations with partially recognised states==

Nauru has used its position as a member of the United Nations to gain financial support from both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) by changing its position on the political status of Taiwan. During 2002, Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC on 21 July. Nauru accepted $130m from the PRC for this action.[tpl]cite news|author=Luke Harding in Moscow |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/14/nauro-recognises-abkhazia-south-ossetia |title=Tiny Nauru struts world stage by recognizing breakaway republics |publisher=Guardian |date= 14 December 2009 | accessdate=22 June 2010 | location=London[/tpl] In response, the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later.
