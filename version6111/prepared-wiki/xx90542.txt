==History==

Invensys was formed through the merger of BTR plc and Siebe plc in 1999. From 1999 to 2004, it underwent a major restructuring programme to cut its costs as falling sales and large debts had led to the danger of its going bankrupt. A major disposal programme combined with a £2.7bn debt restructuring in 2004 saved it from collapse.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2004/apr/18/theobserver.observerbusiness11 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Nick | last=Mathiason | title=Good signals at Invensys | date=18 April 2004[/tpl] During that time it bought[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4458970/ING-paving-the-way-for-Invensys-to-buy-Baan.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Benjamin | last=Wootliff | title=ING paving the way for Invensys to buy Baan | date=19 July 2000[/tpl] and sold The Baan Corporation.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2003_June_3/ai_102698640/ | work=Business Wire | title=Invensys sells Baan for US$135 million | year=2003[/tpl]
