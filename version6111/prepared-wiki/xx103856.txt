The AMC Matador is a mid-size car that was built and sold by American Motors Corporation (AMC) from 1971 to 1978. The Matador came in two generations: 1971 to 1973 and a major redesign from 1974 to 1978. The second-generation four-door and station wagon models were classified as full-size cars and did not share the distinctive styling featured by the Matador Coupe that was introduced in 1974.
Factory-backed AMC Matador hardtops and coupes competed in NASCAR stock car racing with drivers that included Mark Donohue and Bobby Allison winning a number of the races. The new Matador Coupe was featured in The Man with the Golden Gun, a James Bond film released in 1974. AMC Matadors were a popular vehicle in the police market as it outperformed most other police cars. It was also featured in many television shows and movies during the 1970s.
The Matador became AMC's largest automobile following the discontinuation of the flagship AMC Ambassador that was built on the same platform. Premium trim level Oleg Cassini and Barcelona versions of the Matador coupe were positioned in the "personal luxury car" market segment. Matadors were also marketed under the Rambler marque in foreign markets, as well as assembled under license agreements with AMC that included Vehículos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM), as well as built in right-hand-drive versions by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) and by Campbell Motor Industries (CMI) in New Zealand.

==Background==

The Matador replaced the AMC Rebel, which had been marketed since 1967. With a facelift and a new name, the AMC Matadors were available as a two-door hardtop as well as a four-door sedan and station wagon. The Matador was based on AMC's "senior" automobile platform shared with the full-size Ambassador line.
The sedan and wagon models "offered excellent value and were fairly popular",[tpl]cite web |author=Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |title=1974–1978 AMC Matador |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1974-1978-amc-matador.htm |date=26 October 2007 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] including as a prowl car.[tpl]cite book | last=Flory |first=J.

Government agencies, military units, and police departments in the U.S. equipped Matador sedans or wagons with [tpl]convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on[/tpl] or [tpl]convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on[/tpl] V8 engines.
The Matador received a redesign in 1974, in part to meet new safety and crash requirements, as well as a completely different model "to contend with the bull market for plush mid-size coupes that sprang up after the end of the muscle car era."

==First generation==

===1971===

American Motors advertising assured that the new Matador was not just a name change and facelift, but in reality, it was the 1970 Rebel restyled with a longer front clip and a new interior. The 1971 model year Matadors acquired a "beefier" front end look for all three body designs: 2-door hardtop, 4-door sedan, and station wagon.[tpl]cite book |last=The Auto Editors of Consumer Guide | title=History of the American Auto |publisher=Publications International |year=2005 |page=462 |isbn=978-0-7853-9874-5 [/tpl] The AMC Matador shared its basic body design from the firewall back with the Ambassador, which was built on the same platform, but had a longer wheelbase and front end sheetmetal, a formal grille and luxurious trim, as well as more standard equipment that included air conditioning.
While "Matador" may have been a move away from connotations of the Confederacy inspired by the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, it did not help solve the obscurity problem, as AMC adopted a "What's a Matador" advertising campaign.[tpl]cite book | author=Marquez, Edrie J. |title=Amazing AMC Muscle: Complete Development and Racing History of the Cars from American Motors |publisher=Motorbooks International | year=1988 |isbn=978-0-87938-300-8 [/tpl] This self-disparaging marketing campaign "turned the styling of anonymity into an asset."[tpl]cite journal |last=Hartford | first=Bill |title=Something olé, something new from AMC! |journal=Popular Mechanics |volume=140 |issue=4 |page=114 |date=October 1973 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=idQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA114&dq=What's+a+Matador |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] Consumer-research polls conducted by AMC found it meant virility and excitement to consumers.[tpl]cite journal|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904440,00.html |journal=Time |title=Autos: American's Moment of Truth |date=26 October 1970 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] However, American Motors ran into problems in Puerto Rico. Matador turns out to have connotations for "killer" on the island where bull-fighting was abolished when the U.S. took control of Puerto Rico.
The Matador station wagons had an available rear-facing third row bench seat increasing total seating from six to eight passengers. In addition, all wagons included a roof rack and a two-way tailgate that opened when the rear window was down either from the top to serve as an extended flat surface that was even with the load floor, or to swing open like a regular door hinged on the left side.
The Matador came with straight-6 or a number of V8 engines. Transmissions for the Matador included the Borg-Warner sourced "Shift-Command" 3-speed automatic, and a column shifted 3-speed manual or a floor shifted 4-speed manual.

====Matador Machine====

Continuing the muscle car trend, The Machine was moved from being a distinct AMC Rebel model to the new Matador only as a performance package option on two-door hardtops. The performance options could also be ordered individually making it possible to "Go Package" equip a four-door Matador sedan or station wagon.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.streetlegaltv.com/features/car-reviews/muscle-cars-you-should-know-1971-amc-matador-machine/ |title=Muscle Cars You Should Know: ’71 AMC Matador Machine 401 |first=Robert |last=Kibbe |date=2 March 2011 |publisher=Street Legal TV |accessdate=12 April 2014 [/tpl] The 1971 "Go package" Matador coupe version lacked the optional bold red-white-blue striping of its AMC Rebel-based predecessor, and also had no special identification or badging. Less known than the 1970 original, around 50 Matador Machines were produced for 1971.[tpl]cite web |last=Stakes |first=Eddie |title=Matador Machine - 1971 from American Motors |url= http://www.planethoustonamx.com/stuff/matador_machine.htm |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] The package featured 15 x 7 inch slot-styled steel wheels with white-lettered "polyglass" belted tires, dual exhaust system, a heavy-duty handling package, power disk brakes, and a choice of either a [tpl]convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on[/tpl] ($373 option) or the [tpl]convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on[/tpl] V8 engine (for $461) with either a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic transmission.[tpl]cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Larry G. |title=AMC Muscle Cars |publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing |year=2000 |page=104 |url =http://books.google.com/books?id=JHVaQFDrx_MC&pg=RA1-PT48&dq=1971+Matador+Machine+package |isbn= 978-0-7603-0761-8 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl]

===1972===

Changes to Matadors were minor until the 1972 model year when the innovative AMC Buyer Protection Plan was introduced. This was the automobile industry's first 12 month or [tpl]convert|12000|mi|km|0[/tpl] bumper-to-bumper warranty. American Motors started with an emphasis on quality and durability by focusing on its component sourcing, improving production that included reducing the number of models, as well mechanical upgrades and increasing the level of standard equipment.[tpl]cite book|last=Boone |first=Louis E. |last2=Kurtz |first2=David L. | title=Contemporary Business |publisher=Dryden Press |year=1976 |pages=223–224 |isbn=978-0-03-013651-1 [/tpl] This was followed by an innovative promise to its customers to repair anything wrong with the car (except for tires).[tpl]cite journal |last=Lund |first=Robert |title=AMC Gets It Together | journal=Popular Mechanics|volume=136 |issue=4 |pages=116–206 |date=October 1971 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=UtgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA116&dq=1972+AMC+gets+it+together |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] Owners were provided with a toll-free number to the company, as well as a free loaner car if a warranty repair took overnight. The objective was to reduce warranty claims, as well as achieve better public relations along with greater customer satisfaction and loyalty.
The previous Borg-Warner sourced "Shift-Command" 3-speed automatic transmission was replaced by the Chrysler Corporation-built TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic that AMC marketed as "Torque-Command." The column-shift 3-speed manual continued as the standard transmission, but the optional 4-speed manual was discontinued.

===1973===

thumb|right|1973 Matador wagon with tailgate downThe 1973 model year brought new U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulations that required all passenger cars to withstand a [tpl]convert|5|mph|0|adj=on[/tpl] front and a [tpl]convert|2.5|mph|0|adj=on[/tpl] rear impacts without damage to the engine, lights, and safety equipment. Matadors gained stronger front and rear bumpers. The front bumper included self-restoring telescoping shock-absorbers and more prominent vertical rubber guards, while the rear bumper gained vertical black rubber bumper guards that replaced a pair of similar and previously optional chrome bumper guards.
A comparison of 1973 Matador owners conducted by Popular Mechanics indicated increased satisfaction and fewer problems than was the case with the owners of the essentially similar 1970 AMC Rebel three years earlier.[tpl]cite journal |last=Lamm |first=Michael |title=It's strong and agile, but thirsty Matador |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=May 1973 |volume=139 |issue=5 |pages=132–135 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=htQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA132&dq=strong+and+agile,+but+thirsty+Matador |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl]
Automobile Quarterly reviewed the 1973 cars and summarized that "AMC actually has a very strong product line, but public awareness of it seems so feeble as to be negligible. ... The Matador became a typical intermediate, an exact counterpart of the Satellite/Coronet or Torino/Montego," and ranked AMC's car as a "good buy."[tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dhKFQJd7husC&pg=PA342&dq=AMC+actually+has+a+very+strong+product+line,+but+public+awareness+of+it+seems+so+feeble+as+to+be+negligible.+...+The+Matador+became+a+typical+intermediate,+an+exact+counterpart+of+the+Satellite/Coronet+or+Torino/Montego |journal=Automobile Quarterly |volume=10 |issue=4 |page=342 |title=A Critical Look at the 1973 American Cars |first=Don |last=Voderman |first2=Jan P. |last2=Norbye |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl]

==Second generation (1974–1978)==

A major design change was introduced with the 1974 models for both the sedan and wagon, while the two-door became a separate and radically styled coupe. These could be considered the "second generation" Matadors. New passenger car requirements set by NHTSA called for the front and rear passenger car bumpers to have uniform heights, take angle impacts, and sustain [tpl]convert|5|mph|0|adj=on[/tpl] impacts with no damage.[tpl]cite journal |last=Norbye |first=Jan P. |title=New bumpers have uniform height, take angle impacts |journal=Popular Science |pages=90–91 |date=October 1973|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lpiMSzja6W4C&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=New+bumpers+have+uniform+Gremlin |volume=203|issue=4 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] The 1974 AMC Matadors accomplished this with massive bumpers. The four-door sedans and wagons received a new front fascia with a hood and grille featuring a prominent central protrusion that followed the front bumper shape. Matadors with this front fascia are sometimes nicknamed "coffin noses".[tpl]cite journal |last=Strohl |first=Daniel |title=Bullfighters with Bucket Seats |journal=Hemmings Classic Car |date=July 2008 |url= http://www.hemmings.com/hcc/stories/2008/07/01/hmn_feature13.html |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl]
Second generation sedans and station wagons continued over all the model years with only minor trim and equipment changes. Powertrains were basically unchanged for all the 1974 to 1978 Matadors. Either an inline six or V8 engines were available with a three-speed automatic transmission. A three-speed manual column-shift transmission was also available with the six-cylinder engine from 1974 to 1976. For 1977 and 1978, all Matadors came standard with the automatic transmission.
A road test by automobile journalist Vincent Courtenay of the 1974 Matador station wagon "praised its performance, handling, and fuel economy considering its size and 360 CID engine." He described it as "a real sleeper on the market. Its performance ranks it in the first line of cars, yet it's reasonably priced."[tpl]cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=PerGbKxOPZYC&pg=PA216&lpg=PA216&dq=Vincent+Courtenay+reviewed+the+1974+Matador+Station+wagon+and+praised+its+performance,+handling,+and |page=216 |title=Storied independent automakers: Nash, Hudson, and American Motors |first=Charles K. |last=Hyde |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8143-3446-1 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl]
Changes for the 1975 model year were minor as AMC focused on the development and introduction of its innovative Pacer, but Matadors now included a standard "no maintenance" electronic ignition developed by Prestolite.[tpl]cite journal|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=ytQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=AMC+polishes+its+petrol+pinchers |pages=105, 176|first=Michael |last=Lamm |title=AMC polishes its petrol pinchers |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=October 1974 |volume=142 |issue=4 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] All U.S. market Matadors featured catalytic converters that required the use of unleaded regular-grade fuel. New "Unleaded Fuel Only" decals were placed by the fuel filler door and on the fuel gauge. Steel-belted radial tires were now made standard equipment on all Matadors.

==Matador Coupe==

American Motors' executives saw an opportunity to replace the "uninspired" Matador two-door hardtop with a new design to capture people looking for exciting, sporty styling in a market segment that was outpacing the rest of the automobile market; and were looking to answer the demand for plush mid-size coupes after the end of the muscle car era.[tpl]cite journal|last=Foster |first=Patrick |title=AMC Matador Coupe. Kenosha's Question Marque |journal=Collectible Automobile |date=December 1996 |pages=51–58 [/tpl]
The 1974 model year introduced an aerodynamically styled fastback coupe with pronounced "tunneled" headlight surrounds. The Matador coupe was the only all-new model in the popular mid-size car segment. The coupe was designed under the direction of AMC's Vice President of Styling, Richard A. Teague, with input from Mark Donohue, the famous race car driver. AMC's Styling Department had greater freedom because of a decision to design the new Matador strictly as a coupe, without the constraints of attempting to have the sedan and station wagon versions fit the same body lines. Reportedly Teague designed the coupe's front as an homage to one of the first AMCs he designed, the 1964 Rambler American. Many were amazed that AMC came up with the fast, stylish Matador, considering the automaker's size and limited resources.[tpl]cite news|last=Jedlicka |first=Dan |title=Matador: bumper-to-bumper style |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=2 January 2000 |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4525600.html |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl]
The coupe's wind-shaped look was enhanced by a very long hood and a short rear deck. The Matador coupe stands out as one of the more distinctive and controversial designs of the 1970s after the AMC Pacer. The Matador coupe was named "Best Styled Car of 1974" by the editors of Car and Driver magazine.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Car and Driver |date=November 1973 [/tpl] In contrast to all the other mid-sized and personal luxury two-door competition during the mid- to late-1970s, the Matador coupe did not share the requisite styling hallmarks of the era that included an upright grille, a notchback roof, and imitation "landau bars" or opera lights. A Popular Mechanics survey indicated "luscious looks of Matador coupe swept most owners off their feet" with a "specific like" listed by 63.7% of them for "styling".[tpl]cite journal |last=Lamm |first=Michael |title=Styling is a knockout, but so is the low roofline! |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=April 1974 |volume=141 |issue=4 |pages=98–101 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=odQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA98&dq=Matador+styling+is+a+knockout |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl]
Sales of the coupe were brisk with 62,629 Matador Coupes delivered for its introductory year, up sharply from the 7,067 Matador hardtops sold in 1973.[tpl]cite web | last= Bond |first=Craig |title=Matador Coupe History 1974–1978 |url= http://www.matadorcoupe.com/history.htm |publisher=matadorcoupe.com |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] This is a respectable record that went against the drop in the overall market during 1974 and the decline in popularity of intermediate-sized coupes after the 1973 oil crisis. After it outsold the four-door Matadors by nearly 25,000 units in 1974, sales dropped to less than 10,000 in 1977, and then down to just 2,006 in the coupe's final year. Nearly 100,000 Matador Coupes in total were produced from 1974 through 1978.
American Motors executives, including Vice President of Design Richard A. Teague, described design plans for a four-door sedan and station wagon based on the coupe's styling themes that did not reach production.[tpl]cite web |title=American Motors Corporation |url= http://www.matadorcoupe.com/images/CoupeProto.jpg |publisher=matadorcoupe.com |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl]

===James Bond movie===

As part of a significant product placement strategy, an AMC Matador coupe played a starring role in a James Bond film that was released in 1974.[tpl]cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=LKh7qgJ8hT8C&pg=PA99&dq=AMC+MAtador+%22The+Man+with+the+Golden+Gun%22 |page=99 |title=Road hogs: Detroit's big, beautiful luxury performance cars of the 1960s |first=Eric |last=Peters |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2011 |isbn=9780760333884 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl]
The Man with the Golden Gun features the newly introduced coupe - along with Matador 4-door police cars (painted in the black and white livery used by the Los Angeles Police Department) and a Hornet X hatchback.  This was Roger Moore's second appearance as the British secret agent.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_6438-AMC-Matador-Coupe-1974.html |title=1974 AMC Matador Coupe in The Man with the Golden Gun |publisher=Internet Movie Cars Database|accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071807/trivia |title=Trivia for The Man with the Golden Gun|publisher=The Internet Movie Database |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] The Matador is the car of Francisco Scaramanga, and along with Nick Nack, they use the "flying" AMC Matador to kidnap Mary Goodnight and make their escape. "Bond is foiled by perhaps the best trick a getaway car has ever performed" as the Matador transforms into a plane to fly from Bangkok to an island in the China Sea.[tpl]cite web|url= http://editorial.autos.msn.com/listarticle.aspx?cp-documentid=691729&page=0 |last=Tannert |first=Chuck |title=Top 10: getaway cars (AMC Matador in The Man with the Golden Gun)|publisher=MSN Autos |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] The whole automobile is turned into a light airplane when wings and a flight tail unit are attached to the actual Matador coupe (that served as the fuselage and landing gear). The idea was based on the Taylor Aerocar design of a roadable aircraft. The machine for this Bond movie was [tpl]convert|9.15|m|0[/tpl] long, [tpl]convert|12.80|m|0[/tpl] wide, and [tpl]convert|3.08|m|0[/tpl] high.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.carenthusiast.com/news0910/bond_3.htm |title=A Chronological History of the James Bond Film Vehicles #6.

The machine was not airworthy and could only make a [tpl]convert|500|m|0|adj=on[/tpl] flight, so a meter-long (39-inch) model was used for the film's aerial sequences. The scenes show the remote controlled scale model built by John Stears.
According to some critics, the movie "didn't offer much to recommend it other than the clever use of cars" such as the conversion of car into an airplane.[tpl]cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=MmhQFeHHF_QC&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=clever+use+of+cars:+it+converted+the+AMC+Matador+into+an+airplane |page=52 |title=James Bond in the 21st Century : Why We Still Need 007.|first=Glenn |last=Yeffeth |first2=Leah |last2=Wilson |publisher=BenBella Books |year=2009 |isbn= 9781935251583 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] The "flying AMC Matador" machine was exhibited at auto shows.

===Oleg Cassini===

A special Oleg Cassini edition of the Matador coupe was available for the 1974 and 1975 model years. American Motors had the famous American fashion designer develop a more elegant luxury oriented model for the new coupe. Cassini was renowned in Hollywood and high-society for making elegant ready-to-wear dresses, including those worn by Jacqueline Kennedy.[tpl]cite book |title=A thousand days of magic: dressing Jacqueline Kennedy for the White House |first=Oleg |last=Cassini |publisher=Rizzoli International |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8478-1900-3 [/tpl] Cassini himself helped promote the car in AMC's advertising.Peters, pp.96–99.
The special Oleg Cassini Matador was positioned in the popular and highly competitive "personal luxury car" market segment at that time.[tpl]cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=H091bBCXrH4C&pg=PA110&dq=Oleg+Cassini+AMC+Matador |title=Standard Catalog of Thunderbird: 1955–2004 |first=John |last=Gunnell |page=110 |publisher=Krause Publications |year=2004|isbn=978-0-87349-756-5 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] The Cassini Coupe was unlike all the other personal luxury competitors. The new Matador did not have the typical vintage styling cues of formal upright grille and squared-off roof, though the rear quarter windows were restyled to resemble small opera window openings. The new "smooth and slippery" two-door featured "marks of haute couture" with the "upholstery, panels and headliner done in jet black, with carpets and vinyl roof in a copper accent color. Outside, striping, rub rails, wheel covers and a crest mark the Matador as Cassini's."[tpl]cite journal |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=idQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA114&dq=Oleg+Cassini+AMC+Matador |first=Bill |last=Hartford |title=Something ole, something new from AMC! |date=October 1973 |page=114 |journal=Popular Mechanics |volume=140 |issue=4 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] The Cassini Coupes were limited to black, white, or copper metallic exterior paints, and all came with the vinyl covered roof. They also featured copper-colored trim in the grille, headlamp bezels, in turbine-type full wheel covers, and within the rear license plate recess.[tpl]cite web|url= http://homepage.mac.com/christopher.z/hobby/Courtesy/_74Coupe.html |title=Oleg Cassini put his special touch to the newest design in automobiles introduced for 1974 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071118095252/http://homepage.mac.com/christopher.z/hobby/Courtesy/_74Coupe.html |archivedate=18 November 2007 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl]
The interior was a Cassini hallmark featuring a special black fabric with copper metal buttons on the individual adjustable and reclining front seats and on the padded door panels, that was set off by extra thick copper carpeting. Additional copper accents were on the steering wheel, door pulls, and on the instrument panel. Embroidered Cassini medallions were featured on the headrests. The glove compartment door, trunk lid, front fender, and hood featured Cassini's signature.

===Barcelona===

In 1976, a "Barcelona" option offered an alternative to the personal luxury cars offered by other automakers such as the Chrysler Cordoba and Chevrolet Monte Carlo.[tpl]cite web|url= http://homepage.mac.com/christopher.z/hobby/78-Matador1.html |title=age dedicated to the Barcelona Matadors |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071118193439/http://homepage.mac.com/christopher.z/hobby/78-Matador1.html |archivedate=18 November 2007 |accessdate=30 November 2013[/tpl] For 1977 and 1978, the "Barcelona II" coupe featured a padded Landau roof and opera windows, styling cues that were required at that time by buyers in the highly popular two-door "personal luxury" market segment. At first it was available in only one distinctive two-tone paint pattern consisting of Golden Ginger Metallic with Sand Tan. For the 1978 model year, the Barcelona came in a second color scheme: an Autumn Red Metallic on Claret Metallic combination. For its final production in 1978, the Barcelona model was also available on the four-door sedan body style.
The Barcelona included numerous comfort and appearance upgrades in addition to the extensive standard equipment that came on all Matadors. The special items were: individual reclining seats in velveteen crush fabric with woven accent stripes, custom door trim panels, unique headliner, headlight bezels painted accent color, black trunk carpet, rear sway bar, GR78x15 radial whitewall tires, color-keyed slot styled wheels, body color front and rear bumpers, two-tone paint, landau padded vinyl roof, opera quarter windows with accents, dual remote control mirrors painted body color, Barcelona medallion on glove box door and fenders, [tpl]convert|24|oz|abbr=on[/tpl] carpeting and bumper nerfing strips. The standard roll-down rear quarter windows were converted into fixed "opera windows" with fiberglass covers over the stock openings that were finished with padded vinyl inside and out.
Motor Trend magazine road tested a 1977 Barcelona II coupe and found it to be equal to all in the objective areas, as well as one of the most distinctive vehicles on the road that "makes a good deal of sense" ... "if you're nor put off by the Matador's unique lines."[tpl]cite journal |last=Hall |first=Bob |title=AMC Matador Barcelona II |journal=Motor Trend |date=August 1977 |pages=107–110 [/tpl]

===NASCAR racing===

Penske Racing prepared factory-backed Matador hardtops and coupes were used in NASCAR stock car tracks. Drivers included Indy winner Mark Donohue and Bobby Allison, and they won a number of races. The company's effort "raised eyebrows" for many NASCAR veterans because AMC was not known for cultivating a racing image.[tpl]cite book |last=Riggs |first=D.

The new 1974 coupe replaced the previous "flying brick" two-door hardtop design.[tpl]cite web |last=Mederle |first=Wolfgang A. |title=AMC History - the 70s |url= http://www.american-motors.de/en/history/70s/ |date=18 April 2010 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] Penske was quoted as saying that they did what they could with the old hardtop, and it did better on tracks with more curves and fewer straightaways. Donohue did not survive to drive the new aerodynamically designed fastback coupe, that many believe was aimed at NASCAR racing. The five wins for the AMC Matador are:
Bobby Allison also won the non-points Daytona 125 qualifying race on 13 February 1975, and finished second in the Daytona 500 three days later.

==Police==

Though the full-sized AMC Ambassador was also offered as a police car, the Matador would prove to be very popular. The largest user of Matador patrol cars was the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), primarily from 1972 to 1974, with some staying in service until the mid-1980s. After extensive testing of the special police models offered by Chevy, Ford, and Chrysler, the LAPD chose the AMC Matador because they "out handled and out performed all the other cars."Mitchell, p. 105. The LAPD police Matadors included among other special equipment: T-2 can lights, a five-channel Motorola Motrac 70 radio, a Federal siren, and a "Hot Sheet Desk" with a Roster gooseneck lamp.[tpl]cite web|url= http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2010/02/09/hemmings-find-of-the-day-1973-amc-matador-cop-car-anarchy/ |title=Hemmings Find of the Day – 1973 AMC Matador cop car (Anarchy!!!) |first=Daniel |last=Strohl |date=2 February 2010 |publisher=Hemmings Motor News |accessdate=20 December 2013[/tpl]
Matador sedans and station wagons was also used by other agencies, including the Los Angeles Sheriffs Department and many other law enforcement agencies across the U.S. and Canada, as well as by military police units.
While V8 power was down for many domestic sedans, AMC used a [tpl]convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on[/tpl] V8 engine that outpowered most other police vehicles. Tests of the 1972 AMC Javelin pony car and Matador sedan equipped with the 401 V8s resulted both running the quarter-mile dragstrip in the 14.7-second range. Zero to [tpl]convert|60|mph|0[/tpl] times were within 7 seconds, comparable to a 2006 Hemi Charger police car.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kuow.org/defaultProgram.asp?ID=11141 | last= Jenkins |first=Austin |title=NW Troopers Slide Behind the Wheel of a Re-Made 1960s Muscle |publisher=KUOW-FM |date=26 June 2006 |accessdate=5 July 2010 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl] Top speed was about [tpl]convert|125|mph|0[/tpl], which took only 43 seconds, much faster than the previously used Plymouth Satellites.[tpl]cite web |last=Redgap | first=Curtis |title=AMC squad cars |url= http://www.allpar.com/amc/ |publisher=allpar com |accessdate=20 December 2013[/tpl]

The 1974 models would be the last year for the LAPD's purchase of the Matador. The second-generation longer-nosed restyle and the 5-mile bumpers added weight that affected handling and performance. Moreover, after 1976, AMC "let the police car business go as it causes too many problems."[tpl]cite journal|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=w0NYAAAAMAAJ&q=It+is+also+likely+that+AMC+will+let+the+police+car+business+go+as+it+causes+too+many+problems |page=39 |title=Sketchbook '77 |journal=Road Test |volume=12 |publisher=Quinn Publications |year=1976 |accessdate=20 December 2013[/tpl]
Matador police cars would appear in many television shows and movies during the 1970s, most famously, Adam-12 from 1972 until the show's end in 1975, Police Academy, and in The Rockford Files beginning in 1974.

Knock-down kits were shipped from AMC's Kenosha, Wisconsin factory for assembly in AMI's facilities in Port Melbourne, Victoria. In addition to the modifications needed for Australian standards and market requirements, changes included the use of "local content" sourced parts and components (such as such as seats, carpeting, lights, heaters, and even unique "R"-logo wheel covers[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.hudson-amc.org.au/gallery/members-cars/palumbo%20matador/palumbo-matador.htm |title=Sue & Greg Palumbo’s 1972 Rambler Matador |publisher=Hudson-AMC Car Club of Australia |accessdate=26 January 2014[/tpl]) that reduced the tariff added to each car.

===Europe===

U.S.-built left hand drive Matadors were exported to the European continent.

===Mexico===

The AMC Matador models were built by Vehículos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) in Mexico.

====First Generation====

Continuing the concept of VAM's version of the AMC Rebel, the Mexican Matador models were only available as a single trim level and in four-door sedan and two-door hardtop forms in their initial year. The hardtop retained the Rambler Classic SST name while the four-door sedan changed from Rambler Classic 770 to Rambler Classic DPL.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arcticboy.com/Pages/arcticboysvam.html |last=Wilson |first=Bob |title=Arcticboy's VAM  Pages |publisher=arcticboy |accessdate=30 November 2013[/tpl] Both body styles saw the same features as the 1971 AMC Matadors and were almost equal with only few exclusive characteristics for each. Standard equipment consisted of four-wheel manual drum bakes, manual steering, [tpl]convert|170|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on[/tpl] gross at 4600 RPM [tpl]convert|252|CID|L|1|abbr=on[/tpl] I6 engine with Carter WCD two-barrel carburetor and 9.5:1 compression ratio, fully synchronized three-speed manual transmission with column shift, 10-inch heavy duty clutch, 3.54:1 rear differential gear ratio with manual transmission, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio with automatic transmission, electric two-speed wipers, electric washers, rectangular full-length 200 km/h speedometer, electric analog clock, collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch, luxury custom steering wheel, courtesy lights, cigarette lighter, dashboard ashtray, locking glove box, wide individual front seats (hardtop), front bench seat (sedan), two-point front seatbelts, front and rear side armrests, dual rear ashtrays, single round dome light (sedan), dual C-pillar dome lights (hardtop), dual coat hooks, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, heavy duty suspension, automatic transmission, heater with front defroster, vinyl roof, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, bumper guards, bumper tubes, and locking gas cap.
For 1972, all VAM cars received the same revisions and improvements of the AMC models. The Classic line saw upgrades in the replacement of the [tpl]convert|252|CID|L|1|abbr=on[/tpl] six in favor of the [tpl]convert|282|CID|L|1|abbr=on[/tpl] with gross [tpl]convert|200|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 4,400 RPM with Carter ABD two-barrel carburetor, 9.5 compression ratio, and 266 degree camshaft. Power brakes with front disks became standard equipment regardless of transmission, a Chrysler A998 three-speed automatic transmission in place of the older Borg-Warner automatics, heavy duty suspension with front sway bar, improved heater with revised controls placed to the right of the steering column, and new two-round-pod instrument cluster. New wheel cover and grille designs were noticeable on the exterior, while seat patterns and side panels were also updated.
Since its redesign in 1970, the hardtop body style started to drop in sales and the front end facelift of 1971 did not help to reverse the trend. VAM did not want to drop it leaving it without a mid-sized two-door. The model was reworked into an all-new limited edition with a sportier focus, as well as featuring more appointments similar to a personal luxury car.[tpl]cite web|url= http://amccars.net/cgi/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1258865214 |author=VAM Rambler Hunter |title=The AMX in Mexico - Alternative Performance |publisher=The AMC Forum |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] This became the VAM Classic Brougham, with the name "Rambler" removed to rejuvenate the line, while the four-door sedan became the VAM Classic DPL. The Brougham included as standard equipment power steering, three-speed automatic transmission with floor-mounted shifter (the same unit as the U.S. Rebel Machine models), center console with locking compartment, individual high-back bucket seats (shared with the VAM Javelin), bright trim for pedals, heater, AM/FM stereo radio with four speakers, tinted windshield, and a remote controlled driver's side remote mirror. Despite the marketing and high level of equipment, the public saw it as the previous model. The only external differences with the previous model were limited to the colors, the grille, the standard vinyl roof and the wheel covers. The price was higher than that of the Rambler Classic SST and it did not increase sales for the year, ending below VAM's expectations.
Because of the low sales of the Classic Brougham hardtop, the Classic DPL four door sedan became the only Matador version produced by VAM for 1973, with Javelin being the largest two-door model offered by the company. The 1973 Classic DPLs were virtually the same to their previous year's counterparts with differences only in seat and side panel designs as well as the grille design and a new engine head with larger valves and independent rockers.

====Second Generation====

The generational change that AMC Matadors received for 1974 in the United States was also introduced in Mexico. The Classic DPL obtained the longer "coffin nose" front clip design complete with the change from dual headlights to single units, grille-mounted parking lights as well as five-mile-per-hour bumpers with standard bumper guards. The rear licence plate was relocated to the center of the rear panel and obtained new longer rectangular taillights. The interior saw the all-new padded dashboard with three squared pods for instruments (emergency lights, gasoline level and water temperature to the left, 200 km/h speedometer at the center and the electric clock on the right) and a horizontal radio design. Seats and interior door panels were once again redesigned. Units ordered with the automatic transmission also included power steering and a heater. The beginning of automotive engine emission certification in Mexico affected the [tpl]convert|282|CID|L|1|abbr=on[/tpl] six, which changed to a lower 8.5:1 compression ratio. The rear differential gear ratio was changed to 3.31:1 for both transmissions.
The biggest news of the year was the arrival or a new two-door model, AMC's Matador coupe. Unlike all previous (Matador and Rebel) models, it was available in two different trim levels; the sporty Classic AMX equivalent to the AMC Matador X model and the luxury Classic Brougham equivalent to the AMC Matador Brougham coupe model. Both versions were mechanically the same, carrying the same technical specifications as the Classic DPL models. Their main differences relied in appearance and accessories. The Classic AMX sported VAM's inhouse five-spoke wheels with volcano centercaps and trim rings, a blackedout grille and a rally stripe surrounding the full length of the car with an integrated AMX emblem on the right corner of the trunk lid; the Classic Brougham had a standard vinil roof cover with its respective moldings, wheelcovers (new design for the year), standard grille and "Brougham" emblems over the C-pillar bases. The Classic AMX showcased a three-arm spoked sports steering wheel, high-back fold-down individual bucket seats, center console with locking compartment, floor-mounted gearshift, and AM/FM radio. Despite the sportiness of the model, intended to take the place of the Javelin as VAM's top-of-the-line performance model as well as the image and enthusiast builder, the side armrests were the standard designs used in the Matador base models of the U.S. On the other hand, the Classic Brougham sported a custom sports steering wheel and column-mounted shifter with a fold-down split-back bench seat and AM radio. Unlike the Classic DPL, both the Classic AMX and the Classic Brougham included the automatic transmission, power steering and heater as standard equipment. A unique characteristic of the 1974 VAM Classic AMX was the shifter because it was the Javelin's "aircraft" U-shaped design.
For 1975, changes on all three versions were few. The Classic DPL obtained a new grille design with rectangular parking lights alongside new seats and door panels. The luxury steering wheel obtained a new design for the both Classic DPL and the Classic Brougham. Both coupe models obtained new interior door panels with AMC's full length X-model side armrests; the panels of the sports version also carried an etched "AMX" emblem over the vinyl near the top front corner of the door. The Classic AMX also featured AMC's X-model floor-mounted shifter design. All three versions shared the upgrades of electronic ignition, a vacuum gauge in place of the electric clock, a [tpl]convert|282|CID|L|1|abbr=on[/tpl] I6 with a lower 7.7:1 compression ratio, and Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. There were more changes for the 1976 model year. The Classic DPL and Brougham featured a new design for wheel covers. Both coupe models obtained a new grille design divided in two portions with squared parking lights. The Classic AMX had a new and more discreet side decal covering only the front fenders and a new metal "AMX" emblem on the trunk lid corner. All three versions shared a new 160 km/h speedometer, tinted windshield, and seat designs that were based in AMC's Oleg Cassini units for the Matador coupes. These were color-keyed with the rest of the interior, the most unique ones were those of the AMX as they were individual and included adjustable headrests with integrated Cassini crests and reclining mechanism. This is the only case of a VAM car close to the various U.S. AMC designer cars.
The Classic line was discontinued in the middle of the 1976 model year. VAM was looking forward to introducing the Pacer model to Mexican market, which would represent its fourth product line, while Mexican legislation at the time allowed only three per marque. Having both the Classic and the Pacer in the luxury market segment would have also caused internal competition. VAM favored the new Pacer over what until that time had been its flagship model. Starting in 1977, VAM's most luxurious model was the Pacer,[tpl]cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=r9j7MWLE_jMC&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=AMC+Pacer+in+Mexico |page=202 |title=The Cars of American Motors: An Illustrated History |first=Marc |last=Cranswick |publisher=McFarland |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-7864-4672-8 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] and its largest sized models were the Americans (AMC Hornets).

===New Zealand===

New Zealand had right hand drive Rambler Matadors assembled under license from AMC by Campbell Motor Industries (CMI) in Thames.[tpl]cite web |last=Roberts |first=Graeme |title=AMC/Rambler Australia information |url=http://www.allpar.com/amc/ |publisher=allpar com |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] The CMI Ramblers used Canadian-sourced complete knock down (CKD) kits.[tpl]cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=r9j7MWLE_jMC&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=CMI+assembled+right-hand-drive+Ramblers+using+Canadian-sourced+complete+knockdown+kits+until+1975 |title=The Cars of American Motors: An Illustrated History|first=Marc |last=Cranswick |publisher=McFarland |year=2011 |page=219 |isbn=978-0-7864-4672-8 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] They featured modifications for the New Zealand market including continuing the use of the Rambler marque. Matadors were assembled by CMI until 1975, along with other brands, with the company them becoming Toyota New Zealand.

===United Kingdom===

The Rambler name was used on right hand drive Matador models sold in the UK.[tpl]cite web |last= Hayward |first=David O. |title=Chrysler United Kingdom: A History of Chrysler in Britain |url=http://www.allpar.com/world/england.html |publisher=allpar com |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] The cars were supplied by AMI up to 1976, but the final 1977 models in the UK were regular LHD versions imported from the U.S.

==End of the line==

During the late 1970s, the domestic automobile market was moving to smaller cars. The large-sized Matador was no longer attractive to customers demanding more economical cars as fuel and money became increasingly worrisome problems after the 1973 oil crisis and the continuing double digit domestic inflation.
Lacking the financial resources for a full redesign (partly because of the expensive tooling costs of the coupe), AMC dropped the large Ambassador after 1974, while the Matador was discontinued after 1978, around the same time as Ford moved their full-size nameplates to a smaller platform. The downsized 1977 Chevrolet Impala also spelled doom for large intermediates from AMC and Chrysler. American Motors responded to the declining demand for large cars by introducing new nameplate in 1978, the AMC Concord. The Concord was an upmarket restyling and positioning of the compact AMC Hornet which had the same [tpl]convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on[/tpl] wheelbase as the redesigned intermediate 1978 Chevrolet Malibu. It was presented as combing an "easy-to-handle size with a roomy sumptuous interior" and in contrast to the Matador coupe, with "overall styling was pleasant ... would not offend anyone"[tpl]cite web |last= Vance |first=Bill |title=Motoring Memories: AMC Concord, 1978–1983 |url= http://www.autos.ca/classic-cars/motoring-memories-amc-concord-1978-1983/ |publisher=Autos Canada |date=13 June 2008 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl] This was the first full-line of economical, compact-sized cars with luxurious trim, features, and comfort levels previously available in larger automobiles.
American Motors did not have another large car until the Eagle Premier that was developed with Renault's partnership and introduced to the marketplace following the purchase of AMC by Chrysler in 1987.

==Collectability==

While well-restored examples of Matador sedans can still be purchased for under $3,000, ads have been published asking over $10,000 for restored coupes.[tpl]cite journal |last=Koch |first=Jeff |title=Dollar-A-Pound Collectibles |journal=Hemmings Classic Car |date=January 2008 |page=18 [/tpl]
Hemmings Classic Car magazine listed the 1974–78 Matador Coupe as one of their 19 pieces of rolling proof that the old-car hobby need not be expensive and described the Coupe as "possibly one of the most distinctive shapes to come out of the 1970s, and arguably a style pinnacle for the personal luxury movement", the James Bond movie role, as well as its NASCAR history.
An article in 1991 entitled "Cool Cars Nobody Wants" describes the 1974–75 AMC Matadors as a collectable, stating: "long considered the automaker to geeks, American Motors began its slow decline, we believe, when the liberal do-gooders who made up its core market began earning enough money to buy Scandinavian cars."[tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Y0pXAAAAYAAJ&q=AMC+Matador+values |first=Alan |last= Wellikoff |title=Cool Cars Nobody Wants |journal=Esquire |volume=116 |year=1991 |page=124 |accessdate=30 November 2013 [/tpl]
