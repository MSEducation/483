CATEGORIES: Communes in Giurgiu County

Mârşa is a commune located in north-west of Giurgiu County, Muntenia, Romania. It is composed of a single village, Mârşa.

==History==

The etymology is lost in time. The Romanian word mârşăDEX online, 2004 - 2010; retrieved on November 12, 2010 - meaning "lure" or "bait", has probably nothing to do with the name origin. 
According to 1901 edition of Marele Dicționar Geografic al Romîniei (en: Great Romanian Geographical Dictionary), Mârşa was in the 19th century a rural commune located on Drîmbovnic (nowadays Dâmbovnic) Valley, part of Neajlov District (Plasa Neajlov), Vlașca County. Also, former property of Bolintineanu family - the poet Dumitru Bolintineanu (a.k.a. Dimitrie Bolintineanu) being even born in there, Mârşa (Mîrşia) was later divided between Mîrşia-din-Deal (en: Mîrşia-On-the-Hill), property of R. Dumitriu (later dowry to C. Nacu) and Mîrşia-din-Vale (en: Mîrşia-On-the-Valley), property of Nicolae Cioflic (Note: interpreted from original recordLAHOVARI, George Ioan - „Marele Dicționar Geografic al Romîniei”, vol. IV, Bucureşti, 1901, p 368; inserted November 15, 2010).

==Traditions==

===Ignatul===

December 20 represents the starting day for traditional pig slaughter (Tăiatul Porcului) ending on Christmas Eve. The householder himself or a hired skilled neighbor will carry out the entire job, starting early in the morning. Everywhere in the village can be heard the scream of pigs. It takes three to four men to drag out from shelter and put down the animal. The skilled butcher stabs directly the pig's heart with a long sharp knife, for a quick death without suffering. The corpse is left a few minutes for blood draining. Meanwhile, the householder will treat the men who helped him with a cup of home-made brandy (țuică) or wine, preferably hot, thanking them for their help. After that, the pig's body will be cleaned and covered with straws. The pig's entire skin hair will be burned until the skin is cooked enough, all around. While cleaning and washing is done by pouring hot water, the skin is grated using knives, even bricks or simply tin cans, punctured with a nail. At this stage, the skin (şorici) becomes eatable - fresh or slightly salted. Then the hooves are plucked and the body is placed with back on top. A cross sign is cut on pig's back and filled with salt. The housewife is incensing all over and everybody is praying God for food blessing. Only after this moment, the meat can be cut to be kept raw in salt, dried or smoked, or to be prepared using various traditional recipes and kept dried or smoked or even fried in the melted pig's fat. At the end, the householder prepares a meal of pork for those who helped him, this custom being known as Pomana Porcului.
