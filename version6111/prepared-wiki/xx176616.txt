The word odoriko means a dancing girl in Japanese. The train service was named after the title of novel Izu no Odoriko (The Dancing Girl of Izu) by Yasunari Kawabata. The stage of the novel is the destination of the train, Izu Peninsula.

==History==

The limited express service was inaugurated on 1 October 1981 following the introduction of the then-new 185 series EMUs, replacing the earlier Amagi limited express and Izu express services from Tokyo to Izu.[tpl]cite journal| last = Miyake | first = Toshihiko | title = 伊豆への優等列車のあゆみ|trans_title= History of premier trains to Izu| journal = Tetsudō Daiya Jōhō Magazine | volume = 40| issue = 332| page = p.24–31| publisher = Kōtsū Shimbun | location = Japan | date = December 2011[/tpl]
