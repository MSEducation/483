===North to Highway 401===

The expressway crosses Taylor-Massey Creek and the East Don River, and climbs out of the valley, swinging northwards toward Eglinton Avenue.[tpl]sfn|Whiteson|1982|pp=137–139[/tpl] In this section, the DVP passes around the apartment buildings of Flemingdon Park. The lanes split again before the underpass at Spanbridge Road, the road that connects a three-tower complex of apartments to the east of the parkway with Flemingdon Park to the west. The lanes pass beneath the Gatineau Hydro Corridor and reconnect south of the Eglinton interchange.[ref]
</ref>
As it crosses Eglinton, the expressway passes a business park to the west and the Concorde Place commercial and condominium development to the east. The expressway begins to descend back into the East Don Valley. It passes beneath Wynford Drive and two railways (the CPR Midtown line and the CNR/Richmond Hill GO line) before reaching Lawrence Avenue East, one of the few remaining cloverleaf interchanges in Ontario.[ref]
</ref>
This area, known as Milne Hollow, is partially forested, some of the land being conservation reserve.[ref]
</ref><ref>
</ref>
Passing beneath Lawrence and back over the East Don River, the expressway begins climbing out of the valley once more. It reaches the top of the valley and curves along a plateau before passing over York Mills Road. Residential sub-divisions are present along both sides of the road, isolated from the expressway by noise barriers, from north of Lawrence to the Highway 401 interchange.[ref]
</ref>
After rising to meet the interchange, it widens to four lanes and splits into two branches: two lanes continuing north as Highway 404, and the three others as Highway 401.[ref]
</ref>
The entire length of the parkway uses the RESCU Traffic Management System, which was installed in 1994.[ref]
</ref>
Like the similar COMPASS system on provincial freeways, RESCU combines in-pavement sensors with traffic cameras and changeable message signs (6 fixed and 10 portable) to alert drivers of accidents, traffic conditions and upcoming closures. The system is used as a means of managing traffic flow along the parkway. The message signs also frequently display non-urgent messages to motorists, such as notices for future construction, safety messages and smog alerts.[ref]
</ref>
The RESCU Traffic Cameras are located at regular intervals along the parkway.  The cameras, which are operated by the City of Toronto, can be viewed on television and online. The cameras are located on poles and are fixed in direction. There are 16 camera locations on the parkway.  Most have one camera for northbound and one for southbound traffic. RESCU operators monitor the cameras for emergency purposes; local radio and television media use the service for traffic reports.[ref]

===Traffic congestion===

The Don Valley Parkway, along with the Gardiner Expressway, is one of Toronto's busiest municipal routes. It is the sole north–south expressway into Toronto's downtown, a role it was not designed to support. The parkway was planned as one of a series of expressways to provide commuter routes to downtown from the expanding suburbs. Two other un-built expressways were planned: the Scarborough Expressway, expected to handle traffic between downtown and the eastern suburbs, and the Spadina Expressway, expected to serve traffic from the north-west.[ref]
</ref>
By the early 1980s, traffic volumes on the parkway exceeded capacity,[tpl]sfn|Sewell|2009|p=73[/tpl] and today, the parkway has significant traffic congestion on most days. During the morning commute, commuters fill the southbound lanes as far south as Bloor Street. In the afternoon/evening commute, commuters fill the northbound lanes from Bloor Street, and often the full length of the highway in event of a collision or other hazard. The daily congestion has earned the highway the quasi-affectionate nickname of the "Don Valley Parking Lot".[ref]
</ref>
The section immediately south of Highway 401 is often congested at all hours. Traffic studies have attributed congestion in the southbound lanes to the number of lanes merging from Highways 401 and 404 into the parkway and the lane changing that results from merging traffic from Highway 401 clashing with exiting traffic to the nearby York Mills exit.[tpl]cite report |author=City of Toronto |title=Don Valley Corridor Report |publisher=City of Toronto |pages=87–88[/tpl] Congestion in the northbound lanes is attributed to truck traffic coping with the steep grade of the valley, lane changing, and insufficient advanced signage for Highway 401. Most traffic in this section travels north on Highway 404, but only two of the five lanes lead to it.[tpl]cite report |author=City of Toronto |title=Don Valley Corridor Report |publisher=City of Toronto |pages=89–90[/tpl]

==History==

The construction of the Don Valley Parkway was a major undertaking that changed much of the Don valley. While industrial areas existed both near the mouth of the Don River and the area of today's Leaside Bridge, several natural areas remained in those places where the steep sides of the valley had dissuaded large-scale urban development. The post-war growth period of Toronto provided an impetus to build a new automobile route into central Toronto, and the route through the valley was chosen to avoid expropriation of existing development and provide access for new development in the Metropolitan Toronto region. The construction of the six-lane highway modified the valley through the removal of hills, other earth works and the rerouting of the Don River. Since completion, the parkway has not been changed significantly, other than adding one partial interchange at Wynford Drive and updating its infrastructure to current standards.

===Conditions before construction===

The Don River valley, formed during the last ice age, has played an important role in the development of Toronto from its beginning as the Town of York. Using the power of the river, the first sawmill was erected at today's Todmorden Mills by 1795[tpl]sfn|Darke|1995|p=27[/tpl] and other industry was founded soon after, including a grist mill, paper mill and brewery by 1828.[tpl]sfn|Darke|1995|p=57[/tpl] Railways were introduced into the valley after 1850 with the building of tracks into Toronto. By 1900, the Don River south of today's Bloor Street was straightened into a channel for boating purposes, with roadways and industry built on both banks.[ref]
</ref>
North of Bloor Street, the wide valley floor became dominated by industrial concerns of the Taylor family, including the Don Valley Brick Works.[tpl]sfn|Darke|1995|pp=85–86[/tpl] The area from the Forks of the Don and north along the river valleys had been lumbered and farmed, such as at Milne Hollow, but several natural areas remained by the 1950s.[tpl]sfn|Sauriol|1984|p=138[/tpl] The forests of the Don valley had been where Canadian naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton spent much of his youth in the 1870s studying animal life.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=They Were Right To Call It Hogtown |last=Garner |first=Hugh |date=August 2, 1975 |page=A16[/tpl]
The Don Valley Parkway was not the first highway planned through the valley. In the 1930s, a "speedway" through the lower valley was promoted as possible depression relief. Unlike today's parkway, this road would have curved northwest near the Don Valley Brick Works and connected to Mount Pleasant at Davisville.[tpl]sfn|Filey|2006|pp=151–153[/tpl] The city did not have the money and appealed to 'civic-minded citizens' to donate the land on which the highway would be built. None came forward.[tpl]sfn|Filey|2006|p=153[/tpl] In 1939, city transportation planner Norman Wilson proposed a boulevard that would follow the valley into the northeast.[tpl]sfn|Sewell|2009|p=15[/tpl] On January 1, 1946, Toronto voters approved the building of a 'Don Valley Traffic Artery' following the same route as the "speedway" by a vote of 31,882 to 12,328. This was the same plebiscite where Toronto voters approved the construction of the Yonge Subway.[tpl]sfn|Filey|2006|p=153[/tpl][ref]

Recognizing the value of the natural spaces of the valley, conservationists such as Charles Sauriol founded the Don Valley Conservation Association,[ref]
</ref> in 1948 to assist the provincial Don Valley Conservation Authority (DVCA) itself founded in 1946.[tpl]sfn|Rus|1998|p=28[/tpl] The Association promoted conservation of the valley with rail tours and public events.[tpl]sfn|Rus|1998|p=29[/tpl] In 1951, the Ontario Department of Planning and Development released its "Don Valley Conservation Report", which recommended the preservation of the valley, including an artificial reservoir where Lawrence Avenue crossed the Don River. It also proposed that the valley not be used for any new major transportation routes.<ref>[tpl]cite news |work=The Globe and Mail |title=Don River Most Polluted River in Province |date=February 7, 1951 |page=15[/tpl]</ref> The DVCA adopted the report and budgeted to buy lands in the valley, but the City of Toronto withheld funding to the DVCA for land purchases.<ref>[tpl]cite news |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |title=City Withholds Don Valley Grant For Land Purchase |date=July 12, 1951 |page=4[/tpl]</ref>
In April 1953, the Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) federation was approved and Fred Gardiner was named as its first chairman. Its mission from the start was to build the infrastructure needed to support the rapidly growing suburbs, whose governments could not afford the projects and often disagreed on joint projects. One of its first priorities was to build the Lakeshore Expressway, and its second road priority was an expressway through the Don River valley.[tpl]sfn|Sewell|2009|p=67[/tpl] Gardiner was a major proponent of building a highway through the valley, since his days in the 1940s with the Toronto and York Planning Board. At the time, engineers felt that building a six-lane roadway was unfeasible due to the two large hills and a narrow valley. Gardiner and T&Y Board (and later Metro Planning Board) chairman James Maher personally walked the route through the valley, determining the works that would be needed to put the highway through. "We'll move the railway over a piece. We'll tear down the hill. We'll shift the river over a piece, then we can have the highway through there."[tpl]sfn|Colton|1980|p=62[/tpl] Gardiner toured New York City in June 1954 to study the city's expressways and municipal parking lots. Gardiner compared the proposed Don Valley expressway to the scenic Grand Central Parkway, and was quoted as claiming that valleys like the Don are not spoiled by arterial highways, but beautified by them.[tpl]cite news |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=June 4, 1953 |page=15 |title=N.Y.

In October 1954, flooding caused by Hurricane Hazel caused the destruction of bridges and buildings in the valley. As a consequence of the destruction on the Don and other rivers, the provincial government of Ontario banned development on river floodplains. In 1957, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA) was formed, merging all conservation authorities responsible for Toronto watersheds (including the DVCA), with greater powers to manage valley lands.[tpl]sfn|Rus|1998|p=28[/tpl] The MTRCA began expropriating privately owned land in the valley for flood control, often creating or conserving open space uses. Sauriol, who was by then an employee of the MTRCA,[tpl]sfn|Rus|1998|p=32[/tpl] was one of the few to speak out against the parkway project. Sauriol's cottage at the Forks of the Don would be expropriated by Metro Toronto for the parkway,[tpl]sfn|Seymour|2000|pp=58–59, 164–166[/tpl] although much of his land is now part of the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve, which extends from the Forks of the Don, along the East Don to Milne Hollow at Lawrence Avenue, visible from the parkway. By contrast, Metro chairman Gardiner had an opposite opinion of the Don Valley and was quoted "I'll tell you what the Don Valley was. It was a place to murder little boys, that's what it was."

===Construction===

The design of the project was contracted to the engineering consortium of Fenco-Harris, which completed the plans in the fall of 1955. The project included extending Bayview Avenue south along the Lower Don valley, which replaced the 'north' arm of the previous Don Valley roadway project, and the realignment of Lawrence Avenue over the East Don River. The design for the section north of the Don River mouth incorporated the existing river-side Don Roadway on the east side of the River. The design also incorporated  a section of the old Don Mills Road leading up from the River, north of Gerrard, to Broadview Avenue and Danforth Avenue into the highway as a northbound on-ramp from Danforth. The project was designed to carry 60,000 vehicles per day. Fenco-Harris designed the route to be "located on public lands as much as possible, thus minimizing the expropriation of private property. Greenbelt land has been used for right-of-way in preference to acreage which can be commercially developed." The route required the expropriation of less than 25 properties.[ref]
</ref>
The first planned route of the parkway was to follow the lower Don Valley before turning north and continuing along the Don Mills Road right-of-way north to the Toronto Bypass (today's Highway 401). Edward P. Taylor, developer of the Don Mills subdivision, situated at Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue, protested the plan heavily and the path was rerouted along the CPR railway from Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue north-east to meet the Woodbine Avenue right-of-way at Lawrence Avenue, and proceeded north to the Toronto Bypass. To facilitate the Flemingdon Park development, located south-east of Don Mills Road and Eglinton, the entire planned route south of Lawrence to the present interchange at Don Mills Road was moved east to its current alignment.McClelland, Stewart (2007) pp. 242–243
The plan, estimated to cost C$28.674 million,[ref]
</ref>
was approved by Metro Council in early 1956.[ref]
</ref>[tpl]sfn|Filey|2006|pp=151–153[/tpl]
Formal approval to build came in 1958[ref]
</ref>
and construction of the parkway began. A stumbling block to construction was resolved by a deal between Metro and the City of Toronto over City-owned parklands needed for the parkway. North of Bloor Street, [tpl]Convert|30|acres[/tpl] of City-owned land would be transferred to Metro and any lands not needed for the parkway would be developed as parks by Metro. South of Bloor Street, Metro agreed to replace any recreation facilities lost in Riverdale Park due to the parkway construction. The City had threatened to not allow construction through City-owned land.[ref]
</ref>
The first section of the parkway, from Bloor Street to Eglinton Avenue, was opened on August 31, 1961, by Ontario Premier Leslie Frost and Metro chairman Gardiner, who presented Frost with a silver plate.[ref]
</ref>
It opened initially without an interchange at Don Mills Road and had its first traffic jam that day at the Eglinton Avenue exit.[ref]
</ref><ref>
</ref>
The interchange at Don Mills was approved by Metro council on November 2, 1964.[tpl]sfn|Pitfield|1999|p=223[/tpl]
Building the section within the valley required significant civil engineering, including the rerouting of [tpl]convert|3.2|km|abbr=on[/tpl] of the Don River, installation of [tpl]convert|1.6|km|abbr=on[/tpl] of reinforced retaining wall[ref]
</ref>
and the removal of two hills. Tumper's Hill, located near the Don Mills Road interchange, stood [tpl]convert|36|m[/tpl] higher than it does today.[tpl]sfn|Sauriol|1984|p=112[/tpl]
Sugar Loaf Hill, shaped like a cone, which stood alone in the shadow of the Prince Edward Viaduct where Bayview Avenue passes today, was removed completely. The [tpl]convert|1250000|m3|cuyd|abbr=on[/tpl] of earth was used as fill for the parkway and a total of [tpl]convert|4600000|m3|cuyd|abbr=on[/tpl] of earth was excavated and moved.
Besides modification of the natural landscape, the route required relocation and demolition of utilities and residences. Metro relocated [tpl]convert|1.2|km|abbr=on[/tpl] of CNR and CPR railway tracks in the section from Bloor Street to Chester Hill Road to make way for the parkway.[ref]
</ref>
The Todmorden sewage treatment plant, built in 1926, was also demolished.[ref]
</ref>
The route required the removal of five homes on Minton Place located above the valley to facilitate the cut of the valley hillside. Four were demolished and one moved to Scarborough.[ref]
</ref>
Construction of the section from Eglinton Avenue to Lawrence Avenue began on July 1, 1961, and it was opened to traffic in the evening of October 30, 1963, without any ceremony. The segment connected to Woodbine Avenue north of Lawrence Avenue, cutting off access to Woodbine from Lawrence Avenue. Northbound parkway traffic could continue north on Woodbine Avenue, then a two-lane road, from the parkway up to Highway 401. The [tpl]convert|2|km|abbr=on[/tpl] section cost $2.723 million to complete.[ref]
</ref>
The third section to open was from Bloor Street to the Gardiner Expressway. This section involved the removal of CPR rail sidings on the eastern bank of the Don from Eastern Avenue north. Royal Drive, which was a two-way road that connected with Bloor Street between Broadview Avenue and the Viaduct was re-purposed into a one-way north-bound on-ramp. A pedestrian overpass bridge was constructed to connect the east and west sections of Riverdale Park.[ref]
