The Venus Project organization advocates what founder Jacque Fresco calls a resource-based economy. The projected plan is to combine Fresco's versions of sustainable development, energy efficiency, natural resource management, and advanced automation in a global socioeconomic system based on social cooperation and scientific methodology. 
Located in Venus, Florida, the Venus Project is in a 21.5-acre (8.7-hectare) facility.[tpl]cite web|last=Staff|title=The Venus Project: About|url=http://www.thevenusproject.com/about/the-venus-project|publisher=www.thevenusproject.com|accessdate=19 December 2013[/tpl]

==History==

The Venus Project was founded in 1995 as a for-profit corporation by Jacque Fresco and Roxanne Meadows in Venus, Florida.[tpl]cite web|title=Detail by Entity Name: THE VENUS PROJECT, INC.|url=http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail/EntityName/domp-p95000013860-a3c2b71d-6339-48ef-bf4b-457252854fed/venus%20project/Page1|work=Division of Corporations|publisher=Florida Department of State|accessdate=2014-01-21|quote=Florida Profit Corporation[/tpl]

==Resource-based economy==

The term "resource based economy" is used by the Venus Project to describe a hypothetical economic system in which goods, services, and information are free. Fresco argues that Earth has enough resources and that the practice of distributing resources through a price system method is irrelevant and counterproductive to survival.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thevenusproject.com/about/resource-based-economy |title=Resource Based Economy |publisher=Thevenusproject.com |date=2013-12-01 |accessdate=2013-12-15[/tpl]

==The Zeitgeist Movement==

The Venus Project concepts are outlined in the documentary-style film Zeitgeist: Addendum.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EewGMBOB4Gg |title=Zeitgeist: Addendum |work=Video |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25[/tpl] The film premiered at the fifth annual Artivist Film Festival in Los Angeles, California on October 2, 2008.[tpl]citation |title=Home :: The Artivist Film Festival |url=http://www.artivists.org/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081021161025/http://www.artivists.org/ |archivedate=2008-10-21 |accessdate=27 August 2012 |date=October 2008 |quote=Presenting The 2008 Artivist Award Winners! "ZEITGEIST ADDENDUM"  Director: Peter Joseph. Best Feature – Artivist Spirit Award[/tpl] The film is available on YouTube.[tpl]citation |title=Zeitgeist: Moving Forward |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9WVZddH9w |accessdate=13 August 2013 |date=January 2011 [/tpl] Following its release, director Peter Joseph formed the Zeitgeist Movement, and advocated the Venus Project. In January 2011, a follow-up film, titled Zeitgeist: Moving Forward, was released also highlighting ideas from the Venus Project.[tpl]cite web|title=Zeitgeist: Moving Forward (Official Release 2011)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9WVZddH9w|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2014-01-26|author=TZMOfficialChannel[/tpl]
In 2011, the two groups ended their relationship. Speaking in an interview with London Real TV, Fresco cited personal differences between himself and Joseph, as well as lack of control over their collaborative efforts. He specifically noted his concern about the Zeitgeist Movement's professed role as the "activist arm" of the Venus Project, stating that Joseph "never consulted on what the activist arm would do."[tpl]cite web|title=Jacque Fresco – The Venus Project|url=http://www.londonreal.tv/episodes/jacque-fresco-the-venus-project|publisher=London Real|accessdate=2014-01-26|date=2012-09-02|quote=…he said 'I got the idea now. I’m going to run it my way.' I said: 'You can’t do that, I’ve spent 75 years working on this. You have to study more. So I split with him, because I’ve been working on it for so many years, and doing away with my own beliefs in order to understand what shapes human behaviour…he said that he would use TZM movement as the activist arm of TVP. But he never consulted me on what the activist arm would do.[/tpl]
