==History==

The history of the winery dates back to 1874, when the Swiss-German immigrant John Thomann established a small winery and distillery in St. Helena in central Napa County, California. After his death, the winery and Victorian home beside it were sold to another Swiss family, the Leunbergers, who renamed the estate Sutter Home.
As with most Napa Valley wineries, Sutter Home was shut down during Prohibition. The winery remained abandoned until 1948, when it was purchased by John and Mario Trinchero, immigrant brothers from New York City whose family had been active in the Italian wine business. The Trincheros refurbished the winery and began producing Napa Valley wines, initially scraping by making generic jug wines. For years they operated “mom-and-pop” style, selling to their Napa Valley neighbors, who filled their barrels and bottles at the winery’s back door.[tpl]cite news|last= Prial |first= Frank, The New York Times | title=The House Built on White Zinfandel |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E6D9133CF93BA15753C1A96E958260 |date= October 28, 1998 [/tpl]Harvesting the Dream
A turning point occurred in 1968, when Louis “Bob” Trinchero (Mario's oldest son) sampled a homemade Zinfandel made from grapes grown in the Sierra foothills, California’s famed Gold Rush country. Impressed by the character and intensity of this robust, spicy red wine, Bob began vinifying Amador County Zinfandel.

===White Zinfandel===

In 1972, another of Bob Trinchero’s innovations provided the American wine consumer with a new style of premium wine known as White Zinfandel. Initially labeled as an Oeil de Perdrix, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms demanded something in English on the label, and the name, "A White Zinfandel Wine" was added. By 1975 the name Oeil de Perdrix was removed. A fortunate accident occurred during the making of the 1975 vintage, as some 1,000 gallons of bleed-off juice from red Zinfandel refused to ferment to dryness, retaining a substantial amount of sugar, and Trinchero put the wine aside for the time. He said, "Two weeks later, I tasted that wine and it was sweet, had a pink color, and I thought, 'Darn, that's pretty good. We bottled it, and the rest is history."[tpl]cite news|last= Murphy |first=Linda San Francisco Chronicle  |title=White Zinfandel, now 30, once ruled the U.S. wine world| url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/07/03/WI178515.DTL |date= July 3, 2003 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle[/tpl]
By 1987, Sutter Home White Zinfandel had become the best-selling premium wine in the United States. In 1994, Wine Spectator gave Trinchero its Distinguished Service Award for "having introduced more Americans to wine on the table than anyone in history".[tpl]cite web |author=Wine Spectator|title= 1994 Distinguished Service Award: Louis "Bob" Trinchero |date=2007-10-12 |work= Wine Spectator |url= http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Features/0,1197,4047,00.html  |accessdate=2008-06-26 [/tpl]
This prompted the Trincheros to increase its production while refining the wine’s style to accentuate the fruitiness his customers found so appealing. White Zinfandel made Sutter Home a household name and one of the largest, independent family-run winery in the U.S.

Still family-run, Bob Trinchero, Roger Trinchero and Vera Trinchero Torres, along with Vera’s sons, Anthony and Robert Torres, manage a large winemaking organization, overseeing operations from grapegrowing and production, marketing and sales.
