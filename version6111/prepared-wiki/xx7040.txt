The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam  ([tpl]lang-ta|தமிழீழ விடுதலைப் புலிகள்[/tpl], [tpl]unicode|Tamiḻīḻa viṭutalaip pulikaḷ[/tpl], commonly known as the LTTE or the Tamil Tigers), was a separatist militant organisation that was based in northern Sri Lanka. Founded in May 1976 by Velupillai Prabhakaran, it waged a  secessionist nationalist campaign to create an independent state in the north and east of Sri Lanka for Tamil people.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/srilanka/thestory.html|title=Sri Lanka – Living With Terror|date=May 2002|publisher=PBS|work=Frontline|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl] This campaign evolved into the Sri Lankan Civil War, which ran from 1983 until 2009, when the LTTE was defeated by the Sri Lankan Military.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/featuredCrisis/idUSCOL391456|work=Reuters|title=SCENARIOS-The end of Sri Lanka's quarter-century war|date=16 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-05-17-voa11-68644392.html|location=Colombo|work=Voice of America|title=Sri Lanka Rebels Concede Defeat|date=17 May 2009[/tpl]
At the height of its power, the LTTE possessed a well-developed militia and carried out many high-profile attacks, including the assassinations of several high-ranking Sri Lankan and Indian politicians.

Historical inter ethnic imbalances between majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil populations created the background for the origin of the LTTE. Post independent Sri Lankan governments attempts to rectify the disproportionate favoring and empowerment of Tamil minority by the colonial rulers, led to exclusivist ethnic policies, including the ″Sinhala only act″ and gave rise to separatist ideologies among many Tamil leaders. By the 1970s, initial non violent political struggle for an independent monoethnic Tamil state, gave away to a violent secessionist campaign led by the LTTE.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.lk/books?id=BlCXRQo__6oC|title=The Political Economy of Armed Conflict: Beyond Greed and Grievance|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|author=Sherman, Jake|year=2003|location=New York|page=198|isbn=978-1-58826-172-4[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Security And Development: Investing In Peace And Prosperity|url=http://books.google.lk/books?id=YXHRX20ibVAC|publisher=Routledge|author=Picciotto, Robert., Weaving, Rachel.|year=2006|location=London|page=171|isbn=978-0-415-35364-9[/tpl] Over the course of the conflict, the Tamil Tigers frequently exchanged control of territory in north-east Sri Lanka with the Sri Lankan military, with the two sides engaging in fierce military confrontations. It was involved in four unsuccessful rounds of peace talks with the Sri Lankan government over the course of the conflict. At its peak in 2000, the LTTE was in control of 76% of the landmass in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=Humanitarian|title=Humanitarian Operation Timeline, 1981–2009|publisher=Ministry of Defence (Sri Lanka)|accessdate=2 August 2011[/tpl]
At the start of the final round of peace talks in 2002, the Tamil Tigers, with control of 15,000 km2 area, ran a virtual mini-state.

==History==

===Background===

In the early 1970s, United Front government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike introduced the policy of standardisation to rectify the low numbers of Sinhalese being accepted into university in Sri Lanka. A student named Satiyaseelan formed Tamil Manavar Peravai (Tamil Students League) to counter this biased move.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sangam.org/articles/view2/?uid=991|title=Pirapaharan, Chapter 42|author=T.

Inspired by the failed 1971 insurrection of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, it was the first Tamil insurgent group of its kind.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thebottomline.lk/2007/11/28/B34.htm|title=The JVP and Tamil militancy|author=T. Sabaratnam|publisher=BottomLine|accessdate=17 August 2011[/tpl] It consisted of around 40 Tamil youth, including Ponnuthurai Sivakumaran (later, the leader of the Sivakumaran group), K. Pathmanaba (one of the founder members of EROS) and Velupillai Prabhakaran, an 18-year-old youth from single caste-oriented  Valvettithurai (VVT).[tpl]cite web|url=http://dspace.vidyanidhi.org.in:8080/dspace/bitstream/2009/5624/4/JNU-2005-087-3.pdf|title=Formation of the TULF: A formal background|accessdate=27 July 2011[/tpl] In 1972, Prabhakaran teamed up with Chetti Thanabalasingam, Jaffna to form the Tamil New Tigers (TNT), with Thanabalasingham as its leader.[tpl]cite web|url=http://212.150.54.123/articles/articledet.cfm?articleid=57|title=International and Regional Implications of the Sri Lankan Tamil Insurgency|author=Rohan Gunaratna|date=December 1998|accessdate=27 July 2011[/tpl] After he was killed, Prabhakaran took over.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.lk/books?id=4lurfqV-60AC&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=Chetti+Thanabalasingam+died&source=bl&ots=L3gqB0kIZg&sig=z_Bi4Ed6JLMLXd8VYZAIv_oVVF0&hl=en&ei=oh4wTtnGKsXxrQekvrnoCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Cold Terror: How Canada Nurtures and Exports Terrorism Around the World|author=Stewart Bell|accessdate=27 July 2011[/tpl] At the same time, Nadarajah Thangathurai and Selvarajah Yogachandran (better known by his nom de guerre Kuttimani) were also involved in discussions about an insurgency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vgweb.org/acslu/tamil_view.htm|title=Separatist Conflict in Sri Lanka: A Tamil View|publisher=vgweb.org|accessdate=27 July 2011[/tpl] They would later (in 1979) create a separate organisation named Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) to campaign for the establishment of an independent Tamil Eelam. These groups, along with another prominent figure of the armed struggle, Ponnuthurai Sivakumaran, were involved in several hit-and-run operations against pro-government Tamil politicians, Sri Lanka Police and civil administration during the early 1970s. These attacks included throwing bombs at the residence and the car of SLFP Jaffna Mayor, Alfred Duraiyappah, placing a bomb at a carnival held in the stadium of Jaffna city (now "Duraiyappah stadium") and Neervely bank robbery. The Tamil conference incident in 1974 also sparked the anger of these militant groups. Both Sivakumaran and Prabhakaran attempted to assassinate Duraiyappah in revenge for the incident. Sivakumaran committed suicide on 5 June 1974, to evade capture by Police.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2008/6/29020_space.html|title=Pon Sivakumaran, The first Martyr decided to die than suffer the torture in the event of enemy capture|publisher=Sri Lanka Newspapers|accessdate=17 August 2011[/tpl] But on 27 July 1975, Prabhakaran was able to assassinate Duraiyappah, who was branded as a "traitor" by TULF and the insurgents alike. Prabhakaran himself shot and killed the Mayor when he was visiting the Krishnan temple at Ponnalai.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.lk/books/about/Inside_Terrorism.html?id=RSzyEx4do48C|last=Hoffman|first=Bruce|title=Inside Terrorism|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|year=2006|page=139|isbn=978-0231-126-99-1[/tpl]

===Founding and rise to power===

The LTTE was founded on 5 May 1976 as the successor to the Tamil New Tigers. Uma Maheswaran became its leader, and Prabhakaran, its military commander.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/archives/6058|title=Thirty Sixth Birth Anniversary of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|publisher=dbsjeyaraj.com|date=5 May 2012|accessdate=5 May 2012|author=Jeyaraj, D. B. S.[/tpl] A 5-member committee was also appointed. Prabhakaran sought to "refashion the old TNT/new LTTE into an elite, ruthlessly efficient, and highly professional fighting force", notes the terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna. Prabhakaran kept the numbers of the group small, and maintained a high standard of training.Gunaratna, Rohan, "The Rebellion in Sri Lanka: Sparrow Tactics to Guerrilla Warfare (1971–1996)," p. 13. The LTTE carried out low-key attacks against various government targets, including policemen and local politicians. The ideology of the Tamil Tigers emerged from Marxist-Leninist thought, and was secular. Its leadership was atheist.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bermana|first=Eli|author2=David D.

====TULF support====

TULF leader Appapillai Amirthalingam, who was in 1977 elected as the Opposition leader of Sri Lanka Parliament clandestinely supported the LTTE. Amirthalingam believed that if he could exercise control over the Tamil insurgent groups, it would enhance his political position and pressurise government to agree to his demand, which was to grant political autonomy to Tamils. Thus, he even provided letters of reference to the LTTE and to other Tamil insurgent groups to raise funds. Both Uma Maheswaran (a former surveyor) and Urmila Kandiah, first female member of the LTTE were prominent members of the TULF youth wing. Maheswaran was the secretary of TULF Tamil Youth Forum, Colombo brach. Amirthalingam introduced Prabhakaran to N. S. Krishnan, who later became the first international representative of LTTE. It was Krishnan, who introduced Prabhakaran to Anton Balasingham, who later became the chief political strategist and chief negotiator of LTTE, which split for the first time in 1979. Uma Maheswaran was found out having a love affair with Urmila Kandiah. It was against the code of conduct of LTTE. Prabhakaran ordered him to leave the organization.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sangam.org/articles/view/?id=110|title=Pirapaharan, Chapter 21, The Split of the LTTE|author=T. Sabaratnam|date=December 2003|accessdate=27 July 2011[/tpl] Uma Maheswaran left LTTE and formed People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) in 1980.
Meanwhile in 1980, J. R. Jayawardene government agreed to devolve power by the means of District Development Councils upon the request of TULF. But by this time, LTTE and other insurgent groups were not ready to accept any solution less than a separate state. LTTE had no faith in any sort of political solution. Thus the TULF and other Tamil political parties were steadily marginalised and insurgent groups emerged as the major force in the north. During this period of time several other insurgent groups came into the arena, such as EROS (1975), TELO (1979), PLOTE (1980), EPRLF (1980) and TELA (1982). LTTE ordered civilians to boycott the local government elections of 1983 in which even TULF contested. Voter turnout became as low as 10%. Thereafter, Tamil political parties had very little room to represent Tamil people as insurgent groups took over their position.

====Thirunelveli attack, 1983====

The LTTE carried out its first major attack[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/human-interest/3795-children-of-a-lesser-god.html|title=Children of a lesser God|work=The Daily Mirror|date=17 May 2010|accessdate=5 May 2012|author=Najamuddin, Jamila[/tpl] on 23 July 1983, when they ambushed Sri Lanka Army patrol Four Four Bravo at Thirunelveli, Jaffna. Thirteen Sri Lankan servicemen were killed in the attack, leading to the Black July.
Some consider Black July to be a planned rampage against the Tamil community of Sri Lanka, in which the JVP movement and sections of government were implicated.
Many outraged Tamil youths joining Tamil militant groups to fight the Sri Lankan government, in what is considered as the start of the insurgency in Sri Lanka.Sri Lankan families count cost of war BBC News – 23 July 2008

====Indian support====

Due to various geo-political reasons (see Indian intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil War), from August 1983 to May 1987, India, through its intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), provided arms, training and monetary support to 6 Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups including LTTE. During that period, 32 camps were set up all over India to train these 495 LTTE militants,[tpl]cite web|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/970119/plus4.html|title=LTTE: the Indian connection| publisher=Sunday Times|year=1997|accessdate=25 July 2011[/tpl] including 90 women who were trained in 10 batches.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19971212/34650923.html|title=Uppermost in our minds was to save the Gandhis' name|publisher=Express India| year=1997|accessdate=25 July 2011[/tpl] First batch of Tigers were trained in Establishment 22 based in Chakrata, Uttarakhand.

In April 1984, the LTTE formally joined a common militant front, the Eelam National Liberation Front (ENLF), a union between LTTE, the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS), the People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) and the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF).[tpl]Cite journal|title=Tamil Militant Groups|journal=Sri Lanka: A Country Study|year=1988|author=Russell R.

====Clashes with other insurgent groups====

TELO usually held the Indian view of problems and pushed for India's view during peace talks with Sri Lanka and other groups. LTTE denounced the TELO view and claimed that India was only acting on its own interest. As a result, the LTTE broke from the ENLF in 1986. Soon fighting broke out between the TELO and the LTTE and clashes occurred over the next few months.[tpl]Cite book|author=Hellmann-rajanayagam, D.|year=1994|title=The Tamil Tigers: Armed Struggle for Identity|publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag|page=164|isbn=978-3-515-06530-6[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=O'Ballance|first=Edgar|title=The Cyanide War: Tamil Insurrection in Sri Lanka 1973–88|publisher=Brassey's|year=1989|location=London|page=61|isbn=0-08-036695-3[/tpl] As a result almost the entire TELO leadership and at least 400 TELO militants were killed by the LTTE.[tpl]Cite book|last=O'Ballance|first=Edgar|title=The Cyanide War: Tamil Insurrection in Sri Lanka 1973–88|publisher=Brassey's|year=1989|location=London|page=62|isbn=0-08-036695-3[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Wilson|first=A.

Notices were issued to that effect in Jaffna and in Madras, where the Tamil groups were headquartered. With the major groups including the TELO and EPRLF eliminated, the remaining twenty or so Tamil insurgent groups were then absorbed into the LTTE, making Jaffna an LTTE-dominated city.
LTTE's practice such as wearing a cyanide vial for consumption if captured appealed to the Tamil people as dedication and sacrifice.
Another practice that increased support by Tamil people was LTTE's members taking an oath of loyalty which stated LTTE's goal of establishing a state for the Sri Lankan Tamils.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Roberts, M.|year=2005|title=Tamil Tiger "Martyrs": Regenerating Divine Potency?|journal=Studies in Conflict & Terrorism|volume=28|issue=6|pages=493–514|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/uter/2005/00000028/00000006/art00003|accessdate=6 April 2008|doi=10.1080/10576100590950129[/tpl] In 1987 LTTE established the Black Tigers, a unit responsible for conducting suicide attacks against political, economic, and military targets,[tpl]Cite news|first=Frances|last=Harrison|title='Black Tigers' appear in public|date=26 November 2002|publisher=BBC News|agency=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2516263.stm|accessdate=2 September 2007[/tpl] and launched its first suicide attack against a Sri Lankan Army camp, killing 40 soldiers. LTTE members are prohibited from smoking cigarettes and consuming alcohol in any form. LTTE members must avoid their family members and avoid communication with them. Initially LTTE members were prohobited from having love affairs or sexual relationships as it could deter their prime motive. But this policy had changed since Prabhakaran married Mathivathani Erambu in October 1984.

===IPKF period===

In July 1987, faced with growing anger among its own Tamils and a flood of refugees, India intervened directly in the conflict for the first time by initially airdropping food parcels into Jaffna. After negotiations, India and Sri Lanka entered into the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. Though the conflict was between the Tamil and Sinhalese people, India and Sri Lanka signed the peace accord instead of India influencing both parties to sign a peace accord among themselves. The peace accord assigned a certain degree of regional autonomy in the Tamil areas, with Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) controlling the regional council and called for the Tamil militant groups to lay down their arms. India was to send a peacekeeping force, named the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), part of the Indian Army, to Sri Lanka to enforce the disarmament and to watch over the regional council.The Peace Accord and the Tamils in Sri Lanka.

====War against IPKF====

Although the Tamil militant organisations did not have a role in the Indo-Lanka agreement, most groups, including EPRLF, TELO, EROS, and PLOTE, accepted it.[tpl]Cite book|last=O'Ballance|first=Edgar|title=The Cyanide War: Tamil Insurrection in Sri Lanka 1973–88|publisher=Brassey's|year=1989|location=London|pages=91–4|isbn=0-08-036695-3[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Contending with Terrorism: Roots, Strategies, and Responses|url=http://books.google.lk/books?id=zTWnisKC1SUC|publisher=MIT Press|author=Brown, Michael E., Coté, Owen R. Jr., Lynn-Jones, Sean M.|year=2010|location=New York|page=214|isbn=978-0-262-51464-4[/tpl] But LTTE rejected the accord because they opposed EPRLF's Varadaraja Perumal as the chief ministerial candidate for the merged North Eastern Province. The LTTE named three alternate candidates for the position, which India rejected. The LTTE subsequently refused to hand over their weapons to the IPKF. After three months of tensions, LTTE declared war on IPKF on 7 October 1987.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tamilsydney.com/content/view/865/37/|publisher=Tamils Sydney|title=Shocking disclosures – Indian Peace Keeping Forces (IPKF) played double game in Sri Lanka|accessdate=28 July 2011[/tpl]
Thus LTTE found itself engaged in military conflict with the Indian Army, and launched its first attack on an Indian army rations truck on 8 October, killing five Indian para-commandos who were on board by strapping burning tires around their necks.[tpl]Cite book|last=O'Ballance|first=Edgar|title=The Cyanide War: Tamil Insurrection in Sri Lanka 1973–88|publisher=Brassey's|year=1989|location=London|page=100|isbn=0-08-036695-3[/tpl] The government of India decided that the IPKF should disarm the LTTE by force. The Indian Army launched number of assaults on the LTTE, including a month-long campaign dubbed Operation Pawan to win control of the Jaffna Peninsula. The ruthlessness of this campaign, and the Indian army's subsequent anti-LTTE operations, made it extremely unpopular among many Tamils in Sri Lanka.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nesohr.org/inception-sept2007/human-rights-reports/StatisticsOnCiviliansAffectedByWar.pdf|title=Statistics on civilians affected by war from 1974–2004|format=PDF|date=January 2006|publisher=NorthEast Secretariat on Human Rights (NESOHR)|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uthr.org/history.htm|publisher=University Teachers for Human Rights|title=History of the Organisation|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl]

The Indian intervention was also unpopular among the Sinhalese majority. Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa during his presidential election campaign in 1988, pledged to withdraw IPKF as soon as he is elected president. After being elected, in April 1989, he started negotiations with LTTE. President Premadasa ordered Sri Lanka Army to clandestine handed over arms consignments to the LTTE to fight the IPKF and its proxy, the Tamil National Army (TNA). These consignments include RPG guns, motars, self-loading rifles, T81 automatic rifles, T56 automatic rifles, pistols, hand grenades, ammunition, and communications sets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/DH31Df01.html|publisher=Asia Times|title=Chapter 55: Assassination of Athulathmudali|accessdate=28 July 2011[/tpl] Moreover, millions of dollars was also passed on to the LTTE.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=690|publisher=Lanka Library|title=Arming the enemy – Handing over arms to the LTTE|accessdate=28 July 2011[/tpl]

===After IPKF===

IPKF became bogged down in the fighting with the Tamil Tigers for nearly three years, experiencing heavy losses. The last members of the IPKF, which was estimated to have had a strength of well over 100,000 at its peak, left the country in March 1990 upon the request of President Premadasa. A shaky peace initially held between the government and the LTTE, and peace talks progressed towards providing devolution for Tamils in the north and east of the country. Ceasefire held between LTTE and the government from June 1989 to June 1990, broke down as LTTE massacred 600 Police officers in the Eastern Province.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/DF15Df01.html|title=Sri Lanka: The Untold Story, Chapter 44: Eelam war – again|accessdate=28 July 2011|year=2002|work=K.

Fighting continued throughout the 1990s, and was marked by two key assassinations carried out by the LTTE: that of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1993, using suicide bombers in both occasions. The fighting briefly halted in 1994 following the election of Chandrika Kumaratunga as President of Sri Lanka and the onset of peace talks, but fighting resumed after LTTE sunk two Sri Lanka Navy boats in April 1995.[tpl]cite web|title=A Look at the Peace Negotiations| publisher=Inter Press Service|year=2003|url=http://ipsnews.net/srilanka/timeline.shtml|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl] In a series of military operations that followed, the Sri Lanka Army recaptured the Jaffna Peninsula.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/5/newsid_4618000/4618661.stm|title=Jaffna falls to Sri Lankan army|publisher=BBC News|agency=BBC News|date=5 December 1995|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl] Further offensives followed over the next three years, and the military captured vast areas in the north of the country from the LTTE, including area in the Vanni region, the town of Kilinochchi, and many smaller towns.

This culminated in the capture in April 2000 of the strategically important Elephant Pass base complex, located at the entrance of the Jaffna Peninsula, after prolonged fighting against the Sri Lanka Army.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1709/17091240.htm|title=The fall of Elephant Pass|author=V.

===Dissension===

In the biggest show of dissent from within the organisation, a senior LTTE commander named Colonel Karuna (nom de guerre of Vinayagamoorthi Muralitharan) broke away from the LTTE in March 2004 and formed the TamilEela Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (later Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal), amid allegations that the northern commanders were overlooking the needs of the eastern Tamils. The LTTE leadership accused him of mishandling funds and questioned him about his recent personal behaviour. He tried to take control of the eastern province from the LTTE, which caused clashes between the LTTE and TMVP.

====Defeat in the East====

Eelam War IV had commenced in the East. Mavil Aru fell into the hands of Sri Lanka Army by 15 August 2006. Systematically, Sampoor, Vakarai, Kanjikudichchi Aru and Batticaloa also fell into the hands of military. Finally the military captured Thoppigala, the Tiger stronghold in Eastern Province on 11 July 2007.

====Defeat in the North====

Sporadic fighting in the North had been going on for months, but the intensity of the clashes increased after September 2007. Gradually, the defence lines of the LTTE began to fall. The advancing military confined the LTTE into rapidly diminishing areas in the North.

Two major divisions of the LTTE were, the military wing and the political wing.
The military wing consisted of at least 11 separate divisions including the conventional fighting forces, Charles Anthony Brigade[tpl]cite news|title=Charles Anthony Brigade retrained|url=http://defencenet.blogspot.com/2007/02/charles-anthony-brigade-retrained-ltte.html|work=DefenceNet|date=7 February 2007|accessdate=8 October 2008[/tpl] and Jeyanthan Brigade;[tpl]cite news|title=Army commandos join the battle|url=http://defencenet.blogspot.com/2007/03/army-commandos-join-battle.html|work=DefenceNet|date=16 March 2007|accessdate=17 December 2008[/tpl] the dreaded suicide wing called the Black Tigers; naval wing Sea Tigers, air-wing Air Tigers, LTTE leader Prabhakaran's personal security divisions, Imran Pandian regiment and Ratha regiment;[tpl]cite news|title=For This All that Blood was Shed|url=http://srilankawatch.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=33&Itemid=1|work=Srilanka Watch|date=13 April 2009|accessdate=31 July 2011[/tpl] auxiliary military units such as Kittu artillery brigade, Kutti Sri mortar brigade, Ponnamman mining unit and hit-and-run squads like Pistol gang. Charles Anthony brigade was the first conventional fighting formation created by LTTE. Sea Tiger division was founded in 1984, under the leadership of Thillaiyampalam Sivanesan alias Soosai. LTTE acquired its first light aircraft in the late 1990s. Vaithilingam Sornalingam alias Shankar was instrumental in creating the Air Tigers.Tiger Air Wing participates in celebrations. TamilNet, 28 November 1998.Tigers confirm Air wing. TamilNet, 27 November 1998. It carried out 9 air attacks since 2007, including one last suicide air raid targeting Sri Lanka Air Force headquarters, Colombo in February 2009. LTTE is the only terrorist-proscribed organisation to acquire aircraft. LTTE intelligence wing consisted of Tiger Organization Security Intelligence Service aka TOSIS, run by Pottu Amman, and a separate military intelligence division.
Politically the LTTE was never serious about a political solution,[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |title=Tamils caught between the devil and deep deep blue sea|url=http://www.srilankademocracy.org/?page=presspage&id=15|work=Sri Lanka Democracy Forum|date=|accessdate=1 August 2011[/tpl] it operated a systematic and powerful political wing, which functioned like a separate state in the LTTE controlled area. In 1989, it established a political party named People's Front of Liberation Tigers, under Gopalaswamy Mahendraraja alias Mahattaya. It was abandoned soon after. Later, S. P. Thamilselvan was appointed the head of the political wing. He was a member of the LTTE delegation for Norwegian brokered peace talks too. After the death of Thamilselvan in November 2007, Balasingham Nadesan was appointed as its leader.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |title=Nadesan to head LTTE political wing  |url=http://news.chennaionline.com/newsitem.aspx?NEWSID=8b48a16c-65fa-4aae-8105-92ecc39aafa7&CATEGORYNAME=NATL|work=Chennai Online|date=November 2007|accessdate=31 July 2011[/tpl] Major sections within the political wing include International peace secretariat, led by Pulidevan, LTTE Police, LTTE court, Bank of Tamil Eelam, Sports division and "Voice of Tigers" Radio broadcasting station of LTTE.
LTTE is also known for the use of female cadres for military engagements. Its women's' wing consisted of Malathi and Sothiya Brigades.
The LTTE also controlled a powerful international wing called the "KP branch", controlled by Selvarasa Pathmanathan, "Castro branch", controlled by Veerakathy Manivannam alias Castro, and "Aiyannah group" led by Ponniah Anandaraja alias Aiyannah.

==Global network==

LTTE had developed a massive international network since the days of N. S. Krishnan, who served as its first international representative. In the late 1970s, TULF parliamentarian and opposition leader A. Amirthalingam provided letters of reference for fundraising, and V. N. Navaratnam, who was an executive committee member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), introduced many influential and wealthy Tamils living overseas to Tamil insurgent leaders. Navaratnam also introduced LTTE members to the members of Polisario Front, a national liberation movement in Morocco, at a meeting held in Oslo, Norway. In 1978, during the world tour of Amirthalingam (with London-based Eelam activist S. K. Vaikundavasan), he formed the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC), which later turned out to be an LTTE front organization.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tamilnation.co/terrorism/us/ltte/070425arrest.htm|title=World Tamil Coordinating Committee representative arrested in New York says U.S. Justice Department|date=December 2007| publisher=Tamil Nation|accessdate=29 July 2011[/tpl] The global contacts of LTTE grew steadily since then. At the height of its power, LTTE had 42 offices all over the world. The global network of LTTE engages in propaganda, fundraising, arms procurement, and shipping.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.llrcarchive.org/2010/10/rohan-gunaratne/|title=Transcript- Rohan Gunaratne|publisher=Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission|year=2010|accessdate=28 July 2011[/tpl]
There were three types of organisations to do propaganda and fund raising—i.e., Front, Cover, and Sympathetic. Prior to the ethnic riots of 1983, attempts to raise funds for a sustaining military campaign were not realised. It was the mass exodus of Tamil civilians to India and western countries following Black July ethnic riots, which made it possible. As the armed conflict evolved and voluntary donations dwindled, LTTE used force and threats to collect money.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sangam.org/NEWSEXTRA/ExtortionClaims.htm|title=Tamil Canadians Dismiss Extortion Claims|last=|first=|publisher=sangam.org|date=27 August 1999|accessdate=29 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_11A/May24_1306259966CH.php|title=Dutch authorities seek permission to question KP and other former LTTE leaders in Sri Lanka|last=|first=|publisher=Colombo Page|date=24 May 2011|accessdate=29 July 2011[/tpl] LTTE was worth US$200–300 million at its peak.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/south-asia/sri-lanka/186%20The%20Sri%20Lankan%20Tamil%20Diaspora%20after%20the%20LTTE.pdf|title=The Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora After the LTTE|date=February 2010|publisher=International Crisis Group|accessdate=24 August 2011[/tpl] The group's global network owned numerous business ventures in various countries. These include investment in real estate, shipping, grocery stores, gold and jewellery stores, gas stations, restaurants, production of films, mass media organisations (TV, radio, print), industries, etc. It was also in control of numerous charitable organisations including Tamils Rehabilitation Organisation, which was banned and funds were frozen by United States Treasury in 2007 for covertly financing terrorism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ombwatch.org/node/3540|title=Tamil Rehabilitation Organization and its U.S. Branch Shut Down|date=December July 2007|publisher=ombwatch.org|accessdate=29 July 2011[/tpl]
Arms Procurement and shipping activities of LTTE were largely clandestine. Prior to 1983, it procured weapons mainly from Afghanistan via the Indo-Pakistani border. Explosives were purchased from commercial markets in India. From 1983 to 1987, LTTE acquired substantial amount of weapons from RAW[tpl]dubious|date=November 2011[/tpl] and from Lebanon, Cyprus, Singapore, and Malaysia-based arms dealers. LTTE received its first consignment of arms from Singapore in 1984 on board the MV Cholan, the first ship owned by the organisation. Funds were received and cargo was cleared at Chennai Port with the assistance of M. G. Ramachandran, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sangam.org/articles/view2/?uid=658|title=Foundation for Tamil Eelam|author= T. Sabaratnam|month=|year=| publisher=ombwatch.org|accessdate=29 July 2011[/tpl] In November 1994, LTTE was able to purchase whopping 60 tonnes of explosives (50 tonnes of TNT and 10 tonnes of RDX) from Rubezone Chemical plant in Ukraine, providing a forged Bangladeshi Ministry of Defense end-user certificate.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/07/world/tamil-guerrillas-in-sri-lanka-deadly-and-armed-to-the-teeth.html?pagewanted=5|title=Tamil Guerrillas in Sri Lanka: Deadly and Armed to the Teeth|author= T. Sabaratnam|month=|year=| publisher=New York Times|accessdate=29 July 2011|date=7 March 1998[/tpl] Payments for the explosives were made from a Citibank account in Singapore held by Selvarasa Pathmanathan. Consignment was transported on board MV Sewne. Same explosives were used for the Central Bank bombing in 1996. Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia remained the most trusted outposts of LTTE, after India alienated it after the Rajiv Gandhi assassination.
Since late 1997, North Korea became the principal country to provide arms, ammunition, and explosives to the LTTE. The deal with North Korean government was carried out by Ponniah Anandaraja alias Aiyannah, a member of World Tamil Coordinating Committee of the United States and later, the accountant of LTTE. He worked at the North Korean embassy in Bangkok since late 1997. LTTE had nearly 20 second-hand ships, which were purchased in Japan, and registered in Panama and other Latin American countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca201101/20110107ltte_runs_illegal_operations_overseas.htm|title=LTTE runs illegal operations overseas – Minister Gunawardena|publisher=priu.gov.lk|year=2011|accessdate=29 July 2011[/tpl] Most of the times, these ships transported general cargo, including paddy, sugar, timber, glass, and fertiliser. But when an arms deal was finalised, they travelled to North Korea, load the cargo and brought it to the equator. Then the ships are based there. Then on board merchant tankers, weapons were transferred to the sea of Alampil, just outside the territorial waters in Sri Lanka's Exclusive Economic Zone. After that, small teams of Sea Tigers brought the cargo ashore. Sri Lanka Navy, during 2005–08 destroyed at least 11 of these cargo ships belonged to LTTE in the international waters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lankapuvath.lk/index.php/latest-news/security/11261-ltte-ships-still-being-used-for-illegal-activities-|title=LTTE ships still being used for illegal activities|publisher=Lanka Puvath|year=2011|accessdate=29 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.navy.lk/index.php?id=410|title=Sri Lanka Navy destroy three LTTE ships and demolish their arms shipment capabilities|publisher=Sri Lanka Navy|year=2007|accessdate=29 July 2011[/tpl]
LTTE's last shipment of weapons came in March 2009, towards the end of the war. Merchant vessel Princess Iswari went from Indonesia to North Korea under captain Kamalraj Kandasamy alias Vinod, loaded the weapons and it came back to international waters beyond Sri Lanka. But due to the heavy naval blockades set up by Sri Lankan Navy, it could not deliver the arms consignment. Thus it dumped the weapons in the sea. The same ship, after changing its name to MV Ocean Lady, appeared in Vancouver with 76 migrants, in October 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2010/08/04/tamil-migrant-ship-mv-sun-sea-will-arrive-canada-aug-14th|title=Tamil Migrant Ship M/V Sun Sea will arrive Canada by Aug 14th|publisher=Asian Tribune|year=2010|accessdate=29 July 2011[/tpl] In December 2009, Sri Lanka Navy apprehended a merchant vessel belonged to LTTE, "Princess Chrisanta" in Indonesia and brought it back to Sri Lanka.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.navy.lk/index.php?id=2076|title=The acquired LTTE ship, "PRINCESS CHRISANTA" brought in to Colombo Harbour by Sri Lanka Navy|publisher=Sri Lanka Navy|year=2009|accessdate=30 July 2011[/tpl]

==Proscription as a terrorist group==

32 countries have listed the LTTE as a terrorist organisation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/9242|title=Council on Foreign Relations[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3623|title=MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base[/tpl] As of January 2009, these include:
The first country to ban the LTTE was its former ally, India. The Indian change of policy came gradually, starting with the IPKF-LTTE conflict, and culminating with the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. India opposes the new state Tamil Eelam that LTTE wants to establish, saying that it would lead to Tamil Nadu's separation from India though the leaders of Tamil Nadu are opposing it. Sri Lanka itself lifted the ban on the LTTE before signing the ceasefire agreement in 2002. This was a prerequisite set by the LTTE for the signing of the agreement.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/country_profiles/1166237.stm|title=Timeline: Sri Lanka|date=6 January 2009|publisher=BBC News|agency=BBC News|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nation.lk/2009/01/11/newsfe5.htm|title=LTTE ban: Step towards law and order in regained areas|work=The Nation|date=11 January 209|accessdate=23 May 2012|author=Kasturisinghe, Channa[/tpl] Indian Government extended the ban on LTTE considering their strong anti-India posture and threat to the security to Indian nationals.[tpl]cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/india-extends-ban-on-ltte_787439.html|title=India extends ban on LTTE|date=14 July 2012[/tpl]

LTTE also had connections with Maoist Naxalite movement, which is fighting to establish a Marxist Indian state, and Khalistan movement, which is fighting to create a separate Sikh state in India. LTTE's shipping fleet has provided logistics support to Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, a Pakistani group with al-Qaeda affiliations, to transport a consignment of weapons to the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in the Philippines. They also maintain close contact with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

==Assassinations==

The LTTE has been condemned by various groups for assassinating political and military opponents. The victims include Tamil moderates who coordinated with Sri Lanka Government, Tamil paramilitary groups assisting Sri Lankan Army. The assassination of the Sri Lankan president Ranasinghe Premadasa is attributed to LTTE. The seventh Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Rajiv Gandhi, was assassinated by an LTTE suicide bomber Thenmozhi Rajaratnam on 21 May 1991. On 24 October 1994, LTTE detonated a bomb during a political rally in Thotalanga-Grandpass, which in turn wiped out most of the prominent politicians of the United National Party, including presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake MP, Cabinet ministers Weerasinghe Mallimarachchi and G. M.

LTTE sympathizers justify some of the assassinations by arguing that the people attacked were combatants or persons closely associated with Sri Lankan military intelligence. Specifically in relation to the TELO, the LTTE has said that it had to perform preemptive self-defence because the TELO was in effect functioning as a proxy for India.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1617/16171020.htm|title=Chronicle of murders|author=T.

==Human rights violations==

The United States Department of State states that its reason for banning LTTE as a proscribed terrorist group is based on allegations that LTTE does not respect human rights and that it does not adhere to the standards of conduct expected of a resistance movement or what might be called "freedom fighters".[tpl]Cite book|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41744.htm|contribution=Sri Lanka|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices – 2004|author=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|publisher=United States Department of State|date=28 February 2005|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/A4C0BEC5C39CEDACC12571E0005456C3?opendocument|title=UN Expert welcomes Proposed Sri Lanka Commission|author=United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|date=5 September 2006|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|title=Sri Lanka: time to act|first=Meenakshi|last=Ganguly|journal=Open Democracy|date=11 September 2006|publisher=Human Rights Watch[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.genevacall.org/resources/testi-reference-materials/testi-other-documents/clapham-27jan06.pdf|format=PDF|title=Human Rights Obligations of Non-State Actors|first=Andrew|last=Clapham|work=Academy of European Law, European University Institute|date=27 January 2006|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The FBI has described the LTTE as "amongst the most dangerous and deadly extremist outfits in the world".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan08/tamil_tigers011008.html|title=Taming The Tamil Tigers|author=Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)|publisher=U.S. Federal Government, U.S. Department of Justice|date=10 January 2008|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl] Other countries have also proscribed LTTE under the same rationale.

The LTTE argues that instances of child recruitment occurred mostly in the east, under the purview of former LTTE regional commander Colonel Karuna.

===Ethnic cleansing===

The LTTE is responsible for forcibly removing, or ethnic cleansing,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/526407.stm|date=2 May 2000|agency=BBC News|title=Tamil Tigers: A fearsome force|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/04/13/stories/2007041304441600.htm|title=Ethnic cleansing: Colombo|last=Reddy|first=B.

The eviction of Muslim residents happened in the north in 1990, and the east in 1992. The main reason behind the expulsion of Muslims was the fact that local Muslim community did not support the Tamil Eelam struggle of LTTE.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tamilcanadian.com/page.php?cat=181&id=894|title=Is there religious freedom in Tamil Eelam?|publisher=TamilCanadian|accessdate=13 February 2009[/tpl]
Muslims in the North of Sri Lanka contributed to the Tamil movement on several occasions. Muslim ironmongers in Mannar fashioned weapons for the LTTE. In its 1976 Vaddukoddai Resolution, LTTE condemned the Sri Lankan government for "unleashing successive bouts of communal violence on both the Tamils and Muslims".[tpl]Cite book|last=Pararajasingham|first=Ana|title=The Conflict in Sri Lanka: Ground Realities|publisher=International Federation of Tamils (IFT)|page=25|date=December 2005|url=http://www.tamilnation.org/tamileelam/ift/0512groundrealities.pdf|format=PDF|isbn=0-9775092-0-6|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl] But later, LTTE undertook its anti-Muslim campaigns as it began to view Muslims as outsiders, rather than a part of the Tamil nation. Local Tamil leaders were disturbed by the LTTE's call for the eviction of Muslims in 1970.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uthr.org/Reports/Report6/chapter3.htm#_Toc515969885|title=The Expulsion And Expropriation of Muslims in the North|publisher=University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna), Sri Lanka|year=2001|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl] In 2005, the International Federation of Tamils claimed that the Sri Lankan military purposefully stoked tensions between Tamils and Muslims, in an attempt to undermine Tamil security.[tpl]Cite book|last=Pararajasingham|first=Ana|title=The Conflict in Sri Lanka: Ground Realities|publisher=International Federation of Tamils (IFT)|page=16|date=December 2005|url=http://www.tamilnation.org/tamileelam/ift/0512groundrealities.pdf|format=PDF|isbn=0-9775092-0-6|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl] As Tamils turned to the LTTE for support, the Muslims were left with the Sri Lankan state as their sole defender, and so in the eyes of the LTTE, the Muslims had legitimised the role of the state, and were thus viewed as Sri Lankans.
Beginning in 1985, the LTTE forcibly occupied [tpl]convert|35000|acre|km2[/tpl] of Muslim-owned farmland in the north of Sri Lanka, before systematically evicting the Muslims from areas under LTTE control.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/080817/International/sundaytimesinternational_02.html|title=Seeking peaceful solutions to Muslims’ grievances in East|last=Farook|first=Latheef|date=17 August 2008|publisher=Wijeya Newspapers Ltd. Colombo, Sri Lanka|work=The Sunday Times|quote=After 1985, the LTTE forcibly occupied more than 35,000 acres of Muslim residential, agricultural and cattle farming land|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl] Although anti-Muslim pogroms had occurred in the north and east of Sri Lanka since 1985, the LTTE embarked on a campaign to expel Muslims from the north in 1989. The first eviction notice was sent to the Muslims of Chavakacheri on 15 October 1989, after the LTTE entered the local mosque and threatened Muslims a few weeks earlier. Afterward, the houses of evicted Muslims were ransacked and looted. On 28 October 1989, the Muslims of Mannar were ordered to leave, by the LTTE. Before leaving, they had to seek permission and clearance at the LTTE office. LTTE was to decide their exit route."
The deadline was extended by four days after pleas from local Tamil Catholics, who were left to look after many Muslims' property in anticipation of looting by the Sri Lankan army. The Catholics themselves were later robbed by the LTTE of both their own, and the Muslims’ property. On the 28th, while Muslims were preparing to leave, the LTTE barred Hindus from entering Muslim villages and dealing with them. The areas were reopened on 3 November, after Muslims had been packed onto the boats of Muslim fishermen and sent southwards along the coast. After a lull in ethnic cleansing, on 3 August 1990, the LTTE sealed off a Shiite mosque in Kattankady, the Meera Jumma and Husseinia, and opened fire through the mosque's windows, leaving 147 Muslim worshipers dead, out of 300 gathered for Friday prayers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spur.asn.au/kattankudi_muslim_mosque_massare_by_ltte_1.htm|title=18th Anniversary of LTTE's Kattankudi Muslim Mosque Massacre (3 August 1990)|publisher=Society for Peace, Unity and Human Rights in Sri Lanka|date=3 August 2008|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl] Fifteen days later, LTTE gunmen shot dead between 122 and 173 Muslim civilians in the town of Eravur.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/2002/07/21/editoria.html|title=Editorial: Rushing in where monitors fear to tread ...|date=21 July 2002|publisher=Upali Newspapers Limited|work=The Island Online|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl]
Ethnic cleansing culminated on 30 October 1990, when the LTTE forcibly expelled the entire Muslim population of Jaffna. LTTE commanders from the east announced at 7:30 a.m. that all Muslims in Jaffna were to report to Osmania stadium, where they were to be addressed by two LTTE leaders, Karikalana and Anjaneyar. After listening to the leaders denigrate Muslims for allegedly attacking Tamils in the east, the leaders explained to the community that they had two hours to evacuate the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uthayam.net/articles/oct30_2005html_2.htm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5QjPvyYV7|archivedate=30 July 2007|title=Fifteenth Anniversary of Muslim Expulsion From Jaffna|last=Jeyaraj|first=D.B.S.|publisher=Kirushna|date=30 October 2005|accessdate=13 February 2009[/tpl] The community was released from the stadium at 10 a.m., and by noon, and were only allowed to carry 500 rupees, while the rest of their possessions were seized by the LTTE after they were forced to report to LTTE checkpoints upon exiting Jaffna.

In 1992 the LTTE embarked on a campaign to create a contiguous Tamil homeland that stretched from the North of Sri Lanka and downwards along the Eastern Coast. A large Muslim population inhabited a narrow strip of land between the two entities, and so a pattern of ethnic cleansing emerged in Eastern Sri Lanka. "The LTTE unleashed violence against the Muslims of Alinchipothanai and killed 69 Muslim villagers. This led to a retaliatory violence against the Tamils in Muthugala, where 49 Tamils were killed allegedly by the Muslim Home guards".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2008/08/1990-war-year-if-ethnic-cleansing-of.html|title=1990, The War Year if Ethnic Cleansing of the Muslims From North and the East of Sri Lanka|last=Bazeer|first=S.M.M.|publisher=Sri Lanka Guardian|date=25 August 2008|accessdate=13 February 2009[/tpl] Later in the year, the LTTE attacked four Muslim villages (Palliyagodalla, Akbarpuram, Ahmedpuram, and Pangurana) and killed 187 Muslims. The Australian Muslim Times commented on 30 October 1992: "The massacres, eviction and the atrocities by the Tamil Tigers are carried out to derive the Muslim Community from their traditional land in the Eastern province as they have done it in the northern province and then set up a separate state only for Tamils".
In 2002 LTTE leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran formally apologised for the expulsion of Muslims from the north and asked the Muslims to return. Some families returned and reopened the  Osmania College and two mosques in 2003. Since the apology, TamilNet, which is widely seen as an LTTE mouthpiece, has featured numerous stories of Muslim civilians coming under attack from Sinhalese forces.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&artid=27877|title=Sinhala thugs attack Muslim shops in Gampaha|date=1 January 2009|publisher=TamilNet|quote=Sinhalese hoodlums attacked Muslim shops in Poogoda in Gampaha district in the western province|accessdate=9 February 2009[/tpl] During the summer of 1990, the LTTE killed over 370 Muslims in the north and east of Sri Lanka in 11 mass killings.

Sri Lanka's 1981 population census recorded 19,334 Sinhala civilians in  Jaffna District. But with the end of the war in 2009, hardly any Sinhala civilian remained in their places of origin in Jaffna.

===Execution of prisoners of war===

LTTE had executed prisoners of war on a number of occasions, in spite of the declaration in 1988, that it would abide by the Geneva Conventions. One such incident was the mass murder of unarmed 600 Sri Lankan Police officers in 1990, in Eastern Province, after they surrendered to the LTTE upon the request of President Ranasinghe Premadasa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2011/6/67843.html|title=Recalling the saddest day in Lankan Police history|accessdate=12 June 2011|year=2011|work=Lanka Newspapers|publisher=Lanka Newspapers[/tpl] Police officers were promised safe conduct and subsequent release.

===War crimes===

There are allegations that war crimes were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam during the Sri Lankan Civil War, particularly during the final months of the conflict in 2009. The alleged war crimes include attacks on civilians and civilian buildings by both sides; executions of combatants and prisoners by both sides; enforced disappearances by the Sri Lankan military and paramilitary groups backed by them; acute shortages of food, medicine, and clean water for civilians trapped in the war zone; and child recruitment by the Tamil Tigers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/10/22/sri-lanka-us-war-crimes-report-details-extensive-abuses|title=Sri Lanka: US War Crimes Report Details Extensive Abuses|date=22 October 2009|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=17 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2010/12/08/govt-ltte-executed-soldiers/|title=Govt.: LTTE Executed Soldiers|date=8 December 2010|publisher=The Sunday Leader|accessdate=17 January 2010[/tpl]
A panel of experts appointed by UN Secretary-General (UNSG) Ban Ki-moon to advise him on the issue of accountability with regard to any alleged violations of international human rights and humanitarian law during the final stages of the civil war found "credible allegations" which, if proven, indicated that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the Tamil Tigers.[tpl]cite news|title=Report of the UNSG's panel of experts on accountability in SL|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=23146|newspaper=The Island, Sri Lanka|date=16 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=UN panel admits international failure in Vanni war, calls for investigations|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=79&artid=33808|newspaper=TamilNet|date=16 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Summary of UN Panel report|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/top-story/10913-summary-of-un-panel-report.html|newspaper=Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)|date=16 April 2011[/tpl] The panel has called on the UNSG to conduct an independent international inquiry into the alleged violations of international law.[tpl]cite news|title=Sri Lankan military committed war crimes: U.N. panel|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article1701700.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=16 April 2011|location=Chennai, India[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Leaked UN report urges Sri Lanka war crimes probe|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110416-leaked-un-report-urges-sri-lanka-war-crimes-probe|newspaper=France24|date=16 April 2011[/tpl]

==Other criminal activities==

One factor that has greatly benefited the LTTE has been its sophisticated international support network.

===Arms smuggling===

The LTTE members operated a cargo company called "Otharad Cargo" in the United Arab Emirates. There are reports that the LTTE met Taliban members and discussed the "Sharjah network", which existed in the Sharjah emirate of the United Arab Emirates. The Sharjah network was used by Victor Bout, an arms-smuggling Russian intelligence agent, to provide Taleban with weapons deliveries and other flights between Sharjah and Kandahar. Otharad Cargo reportedly received several consignments of military hardware from the Sharjah network.LTTE  : The Jihadi Connection. Jeremie Lanche. IPCS.Tamil Tiger Links with Islamist Terrorist Groups. Shanaka Jayasekara. 02/03/2008
The Mackenzie Institute claimed that LTTE's secretive international operations of the smuggling of weapons, explosives, and "dual use" technologies which is attributed to the "KP Branch", headed by Selvarasa Pathmanathan prior to 2002.Other people's wars: A Review of Overseas Terrorism in Canada, p 46., John Thompson, The Mackenzie Institute. It also claims that the most expertly executed operation of the KP Branch was the theft of 32,400 rounds of 81 mm mortar ammunition purchased from Tanzania destined for the Sri Lanka Army. Being aware of the purchase of 35,000 mortar bombs, the LTTE made a bid to the manufacturer through a numbered company and arranged a vessel of their own to pick up the load. Once the bombs were loaded into the ship, the LTTE changed the name and registration of their ship. The vessel was taken to Tiger-held territory in Sri Lanka's north instead of transporting it to its intended destination. In 2002, Prabhakaran appointed Castro as the international chief of LTTE. He overtook the responsibilities of arms smuggling and related activities from Pathmanathan.

===People smuggling===

Most of the smuggling of Tamil people to western countries was carried out by LTTE. It had largely benefited from this. The prices charged by LTTE to go to countries such as Canada was extremely higher than the normal cost to travel. In addition, money had to be paid to obtain "exit visas" to leave LTTE controlled areas.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://lankagazette.com/topstories/human-smuggling-most-lucrative-business-for-ltte-rump-prof-rohan-gunaratna/|title=Human smuggling, most lucrative business for LTTE rump|publisher=Lanka Gazette|date=July 2011|accessdate=30 July 2011|location=[/tpl] After the war, LTTE's main business has been people smuggling.[tpl]dubious|date=March 2014[/tpl] A cost of LKR 4 million per immigrant was "enforced"  by LTTE operatives.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2011/02/13/exposed-ltte%E2%80%99s-human-smuggling-ring/|title=Exposed: LTTE’s Human Smuggling Ring|publisher=Sunday Leader|date=July 2011|accessdate=30 July 2011[/tpl] LTTE's people smuggling ships included MV Ocean Lady, which appeared in October 2009 off Canada's British Columbia coast with 76 Tamil asylum seekers; MV Sun Sea, arrived in August 2010 off British Columbia, with 492 asylum seekers[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/850885--3-months-on-the-mv-sun-sea-tamil-migrants-describe-their-journey|title=3 months on the MV Sun Sea: Tamil migrants describe their journey|publisher=The Star|date=August 2010|accessdate=30 July 2011|location=Toronto|first=Petti|last=Fong[/tpl] and MV Alicia, carrying 80 illegal immigrants, but was intercepted by Indonesian authorities in July 2011, allegedly heading towards Canada or New Zealand.
