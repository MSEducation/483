Donald Stewart "Don" Cherry (born February 5, 1934) is a Canadian ice hockey commentator for CBC Television and a retired professional hockey player and NHL coach. Cherry co-hosts the "Coach's Corner" intermission segment (with Ron MacLean) on the long-running Canadian sports program Hockey Night in Canada, and has also worked for ESPN in the United States as a commentator during the latter stages of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Nicknamed Grapes, he is known for his outspoken manner, flamboyant dress, and staunch Canadian nationalism.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/doncherry/stories/lexicon.html | title = The Don Cherry Lexicon | work = CBC | accessdate = 2007-12-01[/tpl]
Cherry played one game with the Boston Bruins, and later coached the team for five seasons after concluding a successful playing career in the American Hockey League. He is also well known as an author, syndicated radio commentator for the Sportsnet Radio Network,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/pressroom/2011/05/12/cherry_williams/|title="GRAPELINE" WITH DON CHERRY AND BRIAN WILLIAMS RETURNS FOR A 28TH SEASON ON SPORTSNET RADIO THE FAN 590|author=Rogers Media|date=2011-05-12|accessdate=2012-05-30[/tpl] creator of the Rock'em Sock'em Hockey video series, and celebrity endorser. Cherry was voted the seventh greatest Canadian on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's television special, The Greatest Canadian. In March 2010, his life was dramatized in a two-part Canadian Broadcasting Corporation made-for-television movie, Keep Your Head Up, Kid: The Don Cherry Story, based on a script written by his son, Timothy Cherry. In March 2012 CBC aired a sequel, The Wrath of Grapes: The Don Cherry Story II.

==Early life and family==

Cherry was born in Kingston, Ontario (later moving to Belleville, Ontario to attend Centennial Secondary School (Belleville, Ontario) ) to Delmar (Del) and Maude Cherry.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/cherry-don-know.html|title=The Greatest Canadian | work = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate = 2009-03-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080512150759/http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/cherry-don-know.html |archivedate = May 12, 2008[/tpl] His paternal grandfather, John T. (Jack) Cherry, was an original member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a Great Lakes ship captain. His maternal grandfather, Richard Palamountain, was a British orphan of Cornish parentage who was emigrated to Canada as one of the Home Children. The name Palamountain is a corruption of the Cornish language 'pol-mun-tyr' meaning 'pool by the mineral land'.White, G. Pawley, A Handbook of Cornish Surnames. Palamountain was also a veteran of the Canadian Expeditionary Force.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/whodoyouthinkyouare/stories/ext_don.php| title = Who Do You Think You Are? (Don Cherry) | work = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate = 2009-03-11 | deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Cherry's father Del was an amateur athlete and worked as an electrician with the Canadian Steamship Lines. On the March 15, 2008 edition of Coach's Corner, Cherry wore the green and gold colours of County Kerry, Ireland. In his segment following the game, he claimed ancestry from that region. Cherry's younger brother, Dick Cherry played hockey at various levels, including two seasons in the National Hockey League with the Philadelphia Flyers.[tpl]cite web|title=Legends of Hockey: Dick John Cherry|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=12255|accessdate=May 24, 2010[/tpl]
In his first year with the Bears, he met his future wife Rosemarie (Rose) Cherry née Madelyn Martini (born 1935 in Hershey, Pennsylvania). Rose was hugely influential in Don's life—because of Don's minor-league hockey lifestyle, they moved 53 times; they rarely had decent housing or furnishings, and Don was often away playing during major events, such as the birth of their daughter and first child, Cindy Cherry. Six years after Cindy's birth, Rose gave birth to son Tim Cherry.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0011700 | title = Cherry: Has He Gone Too Far? | work = Maclean's Magazine | accessdate = 2009-03-11[/tpl] When Tim needed a kidney transplant at age 13, Cindy donated one of hers. The two currently live across the street from each other, around the corner from their father, in Mississauga.[tpl]cite web | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=doncherry | title = The Biggest Mouth In Sports | work = ESPN | last = Burnside | first = Scott | accessdate = 2009-03-11[/tpl]
Rose died of liver cancer on June 1, 1997 and in honour of her perseverance, Don created Rose Cherry's Home for Kids. Her name has motivated Cherry to always wear a rose on his lapel. Cherry contributed in developing Rose Cherry's Home for Kids which has since been renamed to The Darling Home for Kids, in Milton, Ontario.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rosecherryshome.ca/faq/faq.html#don |title=Caregiver information |publisher=Rosecherryshome.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-07-28[/tpl] The Hershey Centre in Mississauga, Ontario is located on "Rose Cherry Place," a street named for his late wife.
In 1999, Don married his second wife, Luba.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/article/998677--the-wonderful-unlivable-life-of-don-cherry|title=The wonderful unlivable life of don cherry|date=May 29, 2011|publisher=Toronto Star|author=Vinay Menon|accessdate=Feb 6, 2012[/tpl]

==Playing career==

Cherry played junior hockey with the Barrie Flyers and the Windsor Spitfires in the Ontario Hockey Association. Cherry won the Memorial Cup as a defenceman with Barrie in 1953. He dropped out of high school, and in 1954 he signed with the American Hockey League's (AHL) Hershey Bears.[ref]

Cherry had a long playing career in professional minor hockey, and in 1955 played his only NHL game when the Boston Bruins called him up during the playoffs. According to Cherry, a baseball injury suffered in the off season kept him from making the NHL, despite his almost 20 years playing in the minor leagues. He retired as a player in 1970, but came out of retirement 2 years later to play 19 final games with the Rochester Americans. Cherry won the Calder Cup championship (AHL) four times—1960 with the Springfield Indians, and 1965, 1966, 1968 with Rochester. He also won the Lester Patrick Cup, the Western Hockey League Championship, with the Vancouver Canucks in 1969.

===Career statistics===

===Coaching career===

After the end of the 1968–69 season, his playing career was essentially over. Cherry struggled for a time as a Cadillac salesman and a construction worker. He worked as a painter earning $2 per hour.[tpl]cite news|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-41-1459-9686/sports/don_cherry/clip3|title=A 'straight talking' success|accessdate=2007-08-03|work=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation[/tpl]
In the middle of the 1971–72 season, Cherry became the coach of the American Hockey League's Rochester Americans and won Coach of the Year. The following year, the title of General Manager was added. In his third season behind the bench, Cherry was voted the AHL's "Coach of the Year". After his three-year stint in Rochester, he was promoted to the NHL as head coach of the Boston Bruins, a team that was coming off a successful run of two Stanley Cups and three first-place finishes, but would soon see the exit of superstars Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito.[tpl]cite news|title=Boston Bruins|department=Say It Ain't So| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/news/2001/02/15/sayitaintso_bruins/ |publisher=CNN | accessdate=April 26, 2010|date=May 9, 2001[/tpl]
Cherry quickly developed a reputation for being an eccentric, flamboyant coach who strongly encouraged physical play among his players. According to Cherry, he modeled the Bruins' playing style after that of his dog, Blue, a feisty bull terrier.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Toronto Star|title=Cherry on top I'm proud to call myself a redneck' says Don Cherry the bellicose broadcaster who calls others a lot worse|author=Leslie Scrivener|date=May 23, 1993|page=D1|accessdate=June 23, 2013[/tpl] While the team had previously been known for Orr and Esposito who were highly skilled scorers, their impending departures had Cherry remake the team with enforcers and grinders which became known as the "lunch-pail gang" (or "lunch pail A.C.") and "the Big Bad Bruins". Albeit for a brief slump until Esposito was traded to the New York Rangers for Brad Park, as Esposito disagreed with Cherry's coaching while Park would thrive under it, this approach rejuvenated the Bruins as they continued to be one of the NHL's best teams during the latter half of the 1970s, capturing the division title four straight seasons from 1975-76 through 1978-79. In the 1977–78 season, Cherry coached the Bruins team to an NHL record of 11 players with 20 goals or more on a single team. Cherry won the Jack Adams Award as NHL coach of the year in 1976.[tpl]cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1091863/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Galleries | date=1976-12-06[/tpl]
The Bruins were able to defeat the rough Philadelphia Flyers twice in the playoffs under Cherry's tenure. The Bruins made the Stanley Cup finals twice, both times losing to their arch-rivals, the Montreal Canadiens, in both 1977 and 1978. In the 1979 semi-final playoff series against the Canadiens, Cherry's Bruins pushed the series to the limit but they were undone by a late penalty in the seventh game. Up by a goal with less than two minutes left in the seventh game, the Bruins were called for having too many men on the ice. The Canadiens' Guy Lafleur scored the tying goal on the subsequent power play and ultimately won the game in overtime. Montreal went on to defeat the New York Rangers for their fourth straight Cup title. Cherry, who had an uneasy relationship with Bruins General Manager Harry Sinden, was fired by the Bruins afterward.
Cherry went on to coach the Colorado Rockies the following season. Under his tenure, the Rockies adopted the motto "Come to the fights and watch a Rockies game break out!" and the slogan could be seen on billboards all over Denver in the 1979–80 season. Cherry's hiring as head coach immediately rejuvenated the ailing franchise's fortunes.
However, as he later admitted, his outspokenness and feuding with Rockies general manager Ray Miron did not endear Cherry to management. While Cherry did much to motivate the players, goaltending was still the team's weakness as Miron refused to replace Hardy Åström, whom Cherry dubbed the "The Swedish Sieve". Cherry recalled one game where his players had got ten shots on goal without scoring, but Åström then conceded a goal from the opponent's first shot and so was yanked from net. Of course, Cherry didn't help things when, after watching defenseman Mike McEwen ignore him and refuse to come off during a game, he reached over the boards and manhandled McEwen to the bench. His NHL career and the Rockies ended on a positive note when they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 5-0 in the final game of the season held at home. Years later, while commentating during the 2001 Stanley Cup final between the Colorado Avalanche and New Jersey Devils (the Rockies franchise moved to New Jersey after 1982), Cherry recalled the experience of the Rockies' last game where he was wearing cowboy boots and after it ended, the Rockies players formed two lines so he could depart the ice between them while acknowledging the cheers of the crowd.
In 1983, Cherry was asked by businessman Bill Hunter, who attempted to purchase the St. Louis Blues and move them to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to coach his team in Saskatoon. However, the NHL's Board of Governors rejected the move, and the Blues remained in St. Louis.
Internationally, Cherry was an assistant coach for Team Canada at the 1976 Canada Cup and was head coach for Canada's team at the 1981 World Championships in Gothenburg, Sweden.
Cherry was the part-owner and the former coach of the Ontario Hockey League's Mississauga IceDogs. As owner and general manager, he gained notoriety by refusing to take part in the CHL import draft, and by only playing North American born players. The IceDogs' first three seasons were difficult ones with the team winning a total of 16 games combined. Cherry took over coaching duties in the fourth season. During Cherry's one season as head coach of the Mississauga IceDogs, the team managed 11 victories (only a slight improvement) and failed to make the playoffs for the fourth straight year. Cherry drew some criticism for his sudden decision to allow European born players onto the IceDogs line-up during the one season he coached the team.

===Broadcasting===

After the Colorado Rockies failed to qualify for the 1980 Stanley Cup playoffs, Cherry was hired as a studio analyst for CBC's playoff coverage that spring, working alongside host Dave Hodge. CBC hired him full-time in 1981 as a colour commentator, but he didn't last long in that role due to his tendency to openly cheer for one of the teams playing, especially the Boston Bruins or Toronto Maple Leafs. Instead, "Coach's Corner" was created, a segment that appeared in the first intermission on Hockey Night in Canada, with Dave Hodge. In 1987, Hodge was replaced by Ron MacLean, with whom Cherry has been teamed ever since. For several years he also hosted his own half-hour interview show, Don Cherry's Grapevine, which began on Hamilton's CHCH-TV in the 1980s before moving to TSN. His loud, outspoken nature became notorious, and his shows are described as "game analysis, cultural commentary and playful parrying with host Ron MacLean." Cherry also hosted a syndicated weekly television show called Don Cherry's This Week in Hockey during the 1987–88 NHL season. It featured highlights from the previous week's NHL games. The highlight of each show was when Cherry awarded a Black and Decker cordless drill to the player who levied the "hit of the week" (called the "Drill of the Week" in order to tie into the cordless drill giveaway).
Cherry's commentary is usually peppered with catchphrases like "All you kids out there...," unrestrained affection for his favourite players (including Steve Yzerman and Kingston native Doug Gilmour, whom Cherry affectionately refers to as "Dougie" and once kissed on-air in a famous TV gag), and overall political incorrectness. Another trademark is his bull terrier Blue, originally a gift from the Bruins players.
Cherry tends to frequently focus on a few pieces of advice that he feels strongly about. Virtually every week on Coaches Corner he spends time exhorting the evils of attempting to block a shot using one's hockey stick (arguing that it often causes deflections while impeding the goalie's view of the puck). Two other perennial favourites are the dangers of touch icing (a rule he blamed for the premature end to Pat Peake's career) and the extremely sensitive rules about crease violation during the early 2000s (since relaxed). He is also critical of the two-minute penalty for firing the puck into the crowd from the defensive zone, introduced since the start of the 2005-2006 NHL season.
He also praises hockey players who show great toughness. Examples of this include when, in the 1999 playoffs, a Phoenix Coyotes winger crawled off the ice after enduring a bone-shattering slap shot from St. Louis Blues defenceman Al MacInnis so that another could take his place. Usually at the end of the NHL season, his send off words in recent years have been about NHL prospects entering the NHL draft. His position is that unless a player is guaranteed to be selected in the first or second rounds, they should not physically attend the draft, reasoning that some players could be disappointed if they are drafted later than expected, or worse, not at all.
Cherry returned to the news in May 2004 amid rumours that CBC would terminate his contract for Hockey Night in Canada. However, he re-signed with the network in July.
Branching out from his Hockey Night in Canada duties, Cherry began to release a series of videos called Don Cherry's Rock'Em Sock'em Hockey in 1989. The 15th anniversary video was released in 2003, with a 'Best Of' released in 2005. For the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, NBC decided to feature Cherry in its intermission coverage, a rare appearance on American television. He was partnered with Bill Clement and Brett Hull and it did not conflict with his usual role on CBC as he appeared on NBC during the second intermission.
In May 2008, ESPN announced that Cherry was joining Barry Melrose as a commentator for the remainder of the 2008 NHL Playoffs. He provided pre-game analysis for the conference finals, pre- and post-game analysis for the Stanley Cup finals, and appeared on ESPNews and ESPN Radio. ESPN also announced that he would donate his fees to the Humane Society.[tpl]cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3384071 | title=Cherry joining ESPN for Eastern Conference, Stanley Cup finals | date=May 6, 2008 | accessdate=2008-05-06 | work=ESPN[/tpl]
Don Cherry has been criticized for comments targeting specific ethnicities such as French Canadians and Europeans and this has led to Cherry's broadcasts being put on a seven second delay by the CBC.[ref]

===Opinions on hockey===

Don Cherry is a strong advocate of a tough "Canadian" type of hockey which emphasizes physical play and a "code" of conduct among the players. He believes that fighting is an integral part of the game as it enforces respect between teams and players, as well as being popular with some members of the public.
He has long been a champion of hardworking "journeyman" players, whom he identifies with from his own time spent playing in the minor leagues. Don Cherry's favourite player of all time is Bobby Orr whom he says is the greatest player of all time.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/doncherry/stories/lexicon.html |title=The Don Cherry Lexicon | work=CBC News[/tpl] Other favourites include Doug Gilmour, Vincent Lecavalier, and Cam Neely. Cherry has criticized many players for what he considers dishonourable conduct, but perhaps none more than Ulf Samuelsson and Matt Cooke, whom he considered to be exceptionally dirty players responsible for many severe injuries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZH-hrCOuLo |title=Don Cherry's Ulf Samuelsson Montage‏ |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nig2naN8NTs | title = Don Cherry on Matt Cooke | work = YouTube | accessdate = 2012-02-29[/tpl]
Cherry has strongly criticized the direction taken by the National Hockey League in recent years, reducing fighting in favour of speed, and skill. Specific rules that he criticizes include touch-up icing and the instigator rule.
He also frequently criticizes players for elaborate celebrations after goals. In 2003 Cherry made headlines by criticizing then heavily publicized junior prospect Sidney Crosby for being a "hot dog" because of the way Crosby slid around on his knees after scoring. He also disapproved of a tricky behind-the-net goal the young star pulled off when a game was already out of reach for the team he scored on. He caused some controversy in his criticism of Alexander Ovechkin's celebration after he scored his 50th goal in 2009.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/Minus-xenophobia-and-racism-Cherry-has-point-ab?urn=nhl-145075 |title=Minus xenophobia and racism, Cherry has point about Ovechkin|first=Greg |last=Wyshynski |publisher=Yahoo! Sports |date=02-03-2008[/tpl]

===Political views and controversy===

Over his career on television, Cherry has generated significant controversy about both hockey and politics.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_omalley/20021001.html|title=The toy department of journalism|last=O'Malley|first=Martin|work=CBC News|date=2002-10-01[/tpl]
In 1989, he referred to Finnish-born Winnipeg Jets Assistant Coach Alpo Suhonen as "some kind of dog food", triggering the threat of a lawsuit from Jets owner Barry Shenkarow.
In 2003, Cherry made comments on his CBC segment in support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On March 22, 2003, during Coach's Corner, a heated debate over the U.S.-led war with Iraq took place. Cherry criticized Montreal fans for booing the American national anthem before a game earlier in the week. The conversation then turned to the war when Ron MacLean said "everybody wants to know what you think". Cherry berated MacLean about being neutral on the war and strongly criticized the Canadian government for failing to support the U.S. in the war.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/doncherry/stories/lexicon.html |title=The Don Cherry Lexicon |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06[/tpl] Cherry appeared on the American radio program The Jim Rome Show the following week, stating, "You have to realize the CBC is government owned ... You have to say the government was against invasion of Iraq and I'm for it and I'm on a government program. I really thought this could be the end."[tpl]cite news | title = CBC removes 'inappropriate' video from Web site | url = http://static.espn.go.com/nhl/news/2003/0404/1533887.html | work = ESPN | date = |accessdate = 2009-03-12[/tpl]
In January 2004, on the subject of visors, Cherry claimed on Coach's Corner that visor users have less respect for player safety and attempted to illustrate his claim by saying : "Most of the guys that wear them are Europeans and French guys". This statement triggered an investigation by the federal Official Languages Commissioner, and protests by French-Canadians. CBC consequently imposed a seven-second delay on Hockey Night in Canada. Later on, a study was published that proved Cherry to be wrong: while 50% of Europeans and 40% of French-Canadians wore visors, compared to 22% of North Americans born outside of Quebec, players who wear visors committed proportionately fewer high-sticking penalties than players who do not.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/02/12/cherry040212.html | title = Cherry half-right on visors:survey | work = CBC Sports | date=2004-03-05 | accessdate=2007-12-01[/tpl] Cherry returned to the "Coach's Corner" for the 2005–06 NHL season without the seven-second delay.
After appearing in the Canadian House of Commons on November 7, 2006, he formally stated his support for Prime Minister Stephen Harper, whom he called "a grinder and a mucker" by saying "I give a thumbs up to Stephen Harper for sure. He supports the troops and I support the troops."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061107/don_cherry_061107/20061107?hub=CTVNewsAt11 |title=Bloc MPs boo Don Cherry in House of Commons |publisher=CTV.ca |date=2006-11-07 |accessdate=2011-06-06[/tpl]
On December 7, 2010, Cherry attended the inaugural meeting of Toronto City Council, where he placed the chain of office around incoming Mayor Rob Ford's neck.[tpl]cite news|author=David Rider Urban Affairs Bureau Chief |url=http://www.thestar.com/news/torontocouncil/article/901562--why-don-cherry-backs-rob-ford?bn=1 |title=Why Don Cherry backs Rob Ford |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2011-06-06 |location=Toronto[/tpl] Cherry was asked to say a few remarks and he opened by stating “I’m wearing pink for all the pinkos out there that ride bicycles and everything, I thought I’d get it in.” He then went on to state that he had "been ripped to shreds by the left-wing pinko newspapers out there" and ended saying "And that's why I say he's gonna be the greatest mayor this city has ever, ever seen, as far as I'm concerned! And put that in your pipe, you left-wing kooks." Left-leaning councillors were critical of Cherry's speech, and the following day some of them wore pink clothing in protest, including Joe Mihevc (Ward 21, St. Paul's West) and Ana Bailão (Ward 18, Davenport) wore pink scarves while Janet Davis (Ward 31, Beaches-East York) wore a pink suit jacket.[tpl]cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101208/don-cherry-pinko-rant-101208/20101208/?hub=TorontoNewHome |title=Pink protest follows Don Cherry's 'pinko' rant |publisher=Toronto.ctv.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06[/tpl] Mihevc said, "We all love Don Cherry and his comments and forcefulness in hockey games, but this is council. It’s a political arena where we make it a habit to reach out, talk to others and achieve consensus. To have that kind of, frankly, belligerence and pushing people aside, to start out this way I think is really unfortunate." Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong defended Cherry though he stated that it was "A little over the top" and that "You take it for what it is and you shrug it off and move forward." Cherry defended his comments by stating “Well, what can I tell you? Don’t invite me. You don’t invite a pit bull. If you want a pit bull, you get a pit bull.”[tpl]cite news | title = Don Cherry rips ‘left-wing pinkos’ at council inaugural | url = http://www.thestar.com/news/article/902903--don-cherry-rips-left-wing-pinkos-at-council-inaugural?bn=1#article | work = Toronto Star | date = 2010-12-07|accessdate = 2010-12-08 | first=David | last=Rider[/tpl]

===Greatest Canadian top ten===

In October 2004, the CBC program The Greatest Canadian revealed that its 'top ten' viewer-selected great Canadians included Cherry. Cherry remarked that he would have been inclined to vote for Sir John A. Macdonald (if he had lived in the same time period), who had also been a Kingston resident. He finished seventh in the final tally.CBC Greatest Canadian Cherry is the only living member of the top 10 greatest Canadians who hasn't been awarded an Order of Canada.

===Acting career===

As part of his fame, Cherry has also branched out into some acting roles. He was cast as Jake Nelson in the television series Power Play. Nelson was the coach of the Philadelphia team playing against the Hamilton Steelheads in the playoffs during the first season. Also, he and Ron MacLean provided voices for themselves in the animated television series Zeroman, which starred Leslie Nielsen. He also appeared on an episode of Goosebumps called "Don't Go to Sleep!" where he plays a hockey coach. His voice was also used in Disney's animated feature The Wild, as a penguin curling broadcaster. He also appeared alongside the Trailer Park Boys in The Tragically Hip's video "The Darkest One".
In 2008, he also appeared on an episode of Holmes on Homes, the widely-popular home improvement show. While not appearing scripted, Cherry apparently lived in the neighbourhood and he is shown speaking with Mike Holmes about the construction business and the ongoing project at his brother-in-law's house.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]

===Business and charitable work===

In 1985, the first of a chain of franchised sports bars/restaurants bearing Cherry's name was opened in Hamilton. Cherry started as a partner in the operation and has more recently licensed his name to the chain without holding a significant ownership stake in the company. "Don Cherry's Sports Grill" has locations in Ontario, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.doncherrys.com/About%20the%20Don%20Cherry's%20Restaurants.htm | title = About the Restaurants | work = doncherrys.com | accessdate = 2007-12-31[/tpl]
Cherry, who is an advocate of options for pet owners to keep their pets healthy, has also partnered with companion animal organisation Pethealth Inc. to offer Canadians the hockey-inspired CherryBlue Pet Insurance program. Cherry is pictured on cherryblue.ca with his popular bull terrier Blue, for whom the program is named.
Cherry has lent his considerable persona to several charitable causes, most significantly, organ donation awareness.

===Other accolades===

In 1992, Cherry lent his voice to the charity song "Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Techno" for Canadian Techno group BKS. On November 14, 2005, Cherry was granted honorary membership of the Police Association of Ontario. Once an aspiring police officer, Cherry has been a longtime supporter of the police services. In his own words, "This is the best thing I've ever had." In June 2007, Cherry was made a Dominion Command Honorary Life Member of the Royal Canadian Legion in recognition of "his longstanding and unswerving support of ... Canadians in uniform". In February 2008, Cherry was awarded the Canadian Forces Medallion for Distinguished Service for 'unwavering support to men and women of the Canadian Forces, honouring fallen soldiers on his CBC broadcast during 'Coach's Corner' a segment of Hockey Night in Canada'.Canadian Forces CANFORGEN 044/08 CMP 044 181606Z FEB-08
