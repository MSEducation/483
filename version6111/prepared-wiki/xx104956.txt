Rieske proteins are iron-sulfur protein (ISP) components of cytochrome bc1 complexes and cytochrome b6f complexes which were first discovered and isolated by John S. Rieske and co-workers in 1964.[tpl]cite journal | author =  Rieske JS, Maclennan DH, Coleman, R | title = Isolation and properties of an iron-protein from the (reduced coenzyme Q)-cytochrome C reductase complex of the respiratory chain | journal = Biochem.

They have since been found in plants, animals, and bacteria with widely ranging electron reduction potentials from -150 to +400 mV.[tpl]cite journal | author=Brown, E.N. and Friemann, R. and Karlsson, A. and Parales, J.V. and Couture, M.M. and Eltis, L.D. and Ramaswamy, S. | title=Determining Rieske cluster reduction potentials | journal=J.Biol.Inorg.Chem. | year=2008 | volume=13 | pages=1301–1313 | pmid=18719951 | doi=10.1007/s00775-008-0413-4 | issue=8[/tpl]

==Biological function (in oxidative phosphorylation systems)==

Ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase (also known as bc1 complex or complex III) is an enzyme complex of bacterial and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation systems. It catalyses the oxidoreduction of the mobile redox components ubiquinol and cytochrome c, generating an electrochemical potential, which is linked to ATP synthesis.[tpl]cite journal | author = Harnisch U, Weiss H, Sebald W | title = The primary structure of the iron-sulfur subunit of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase from Neurospora, determined by cDNA and gene sequencing | journal = Eur.

The complex consists of three subunits in most bacteria, and nine in mitochondria: both bacterial and mitochondrial complexes contain cytochrome b and cytochrome c1 subunits, and an iron-sulphur 'Rieske' subunit, which contains a high potential 2Fe-2S cluster.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kurowski B, Ludwig B | title = The genes of the Paracoccus denitrificans bc1 complex.

Plastoquinone-plastocyanin reductase (b6f complex), present in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of plants, catalyses the oxidoreduction of plastoquinol and cytochrome f. This complex, which is functionally similar to ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, comprises cytochrome b6, cytochrome f and Rieske subunits.[tpl]cite journal | author = Madueño F, Napier JA, Cejudo FJ, Gray JC | title = Import and processing of the precursor of the Rieske FeS protein of tobacco chloroplasts | journal = Plant Mol.

The Rieske subunit acts by binding either a ubiquinol or plastoquinol anion, transferring an electron to the 2Fe-2S cluster, then releasing the electron to the cytochrome c or cytochrome f haem iron. The reduction of the Rieske center increases the affinity of the subunit by several orders of magnitude, stabilizing the semiquinone radical at the Q(P) site.[tpl]cite journal | author = Link TA | title = The role of the 'Rieske' iron sulfur protein in the hydroquinone oxidation (Q(P)) site of the cytochrome bc1 complex.

Two conserved cysteines coordinate one Fe ion while the other Fe ion is coordinated by two conserved histidines. The 2Fe-2S cluster is bound in the highly conserved C-terminal region of the Rieske subunit.

==Rieske protein family==

The homologues of the Rieske proteins include ISP components of cytochrome b6f complex, aromatic-ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases (phthalate dioxygenase, benzene, naphthalene and toluene 1,2-dioxygenases) and arsenite oxidase (EC 1.20.98.1). Comparison of amino acid sequences has revealed the following consensus sequence:

==3D structure==

The crystal structures of a number of Rieske proteins are known. The overall fold, comprising two subdomains, is dominated by antiparallel β-structure and contains variable numbers of α-helices. The smaller "cluster-binding" subdomains in mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins are virtually identical, whereas the large subdomains are substantially different in spite of a common folding topology. The Fe2S2 cluster-binding subdomains have the topology of an incomplete antiparallel β-barrel. One iron atom of the Rieske Fe2S2 cluster in the domain is coordinated by two cysteine residues and the other is coordinated by two histidine residues through the Nδ atoms. The ligands coordinating the cluster originate from two loops; each loop contributes one Cys and one His.
