CATEGORIES: Military of Syria, Navies by country

The Syrian Navy ([tpl]lang-ar|البحرية العربية السورية[/tpl]) is the smallest of the Syrian Armed Forces. It is under the Syrian Army's Latakia regional command with the fleet based in the ports of Baniyas, Latakia, Minat al Bayda, and Tartus.

==History==

In 1950, the Syrian Navy was established following the procurement of a few naval vessels from France. The initial personnel consisted of army soldiers who had been sent to French naval academies for training.[tpl]cite web|title=Syrian Arab Navy|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/syria/navy.htm|work=GlobalSecurity.org[/tpl]
During the Yom Kippur War the Israeli Navy sank five Syrian ships without a loss during the Battle of Latakia. As a result the Syrian Navy remained in port for the rest of the conflict.[tpl]cite web|title=The Battle of Latakia|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/latakia.html|work=Jewish Virtual Library[/tpl]

===Tartus===

Tartus hosts a Soviet-era naval supply and maintenance base, under a 1971 agreement with Syria. The base was established during the Cold War to support the Soviet Navy's fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. Since Russia forgave Syria of three-fourths of its $13.4 billion Soviet-era debt and became its main arms supplier, Russia and Syria have conducted talks about allowing Russia to develop and enlarge its naval base, so that Russia can strengthen its naval presence in the Mediterranean.[tpl]cite book|last=Weitz|first=Richard|title=Global security watch--Russia : a reference handbook|year=2010|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-0-313-35434-2|pages=30|url=http://books.google.com/?id=VcdZ9s2IAwMC&pg=PA30[/tpl] Amid Russia's deteriorating relations with the West, because of the 2008 South Ossetia War and plans to deploy a US missile defense shield in Poland, President Assad agreed to the port’s conversion into a permanent Middle East base for Russia’s nuclear-armed warships.[tpl]cite news|title=Big Russian flotilla led by Admiral Kuznetsov carrier heads for Syrian port|url=http://www.debka.com/headline.php?hid=5526|work=DEBKAfile|date=21 August 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080823171949/http://www.debka.com/headline.php?hid=5526|archivedate=23 August 2008|accessdate=7 October 2012[/tpl] Since 2009, Russia has been renovating the Tartus naval base and dredging the port to allow access for its larger naval vessels.[tpl]cite web|title=INSS: Syria Report|url=http://www.inss.org.il/upload/(FILE)1287493352.pdf|publisher=Institute for National Security Studies|accessdate=3 September 2011[/tpl]
