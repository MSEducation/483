EFnet or Eris-Free network is a major IRC network, with more than 35,000 users.[tpl]cite web|url=http://searchirc.com/network/EFnet |title=Search IRC, displaying network information for EFnet |publisher=Searchirc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-04[/tpl] It is the modern-day descendant of the original IRC network.

==History==

Initially, most IRC servers formed a single IRC network, to which new servers could join without restriction, but this was soon abused by people who set up servers to sabotage other users, channels, or servers. Restriction grew and, in August 1990, eris.berkeley.edu was the last server indiscriminately allowing other servers to join it.[tpl]cite book | editor-last = Jones | editor-first = Steve | title = Encyclopedia of New Media: An Essential Reference to Communication and Technology | edition = 1st | date = 2002-12-10 | publisher = SAGE Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | isbn = 0-7619-2382-9 | page = 256 | chapter = Internet Relay Chat | quote = But in August 1990 IRC users began complaining about one specific server, eris.berkeley.edu, which had particularly lax security [/tpl]
A group of operators, with the support of Jarkko Oikarinen, introduced a new "Q-line" into their server configurations, to "quarantine" themselves away from eris by disconnecting from any subset of the IRC network as soon as they saw eris there.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/undernet-history.html |title=#Beginner - Undernet History |publisher=Ircbeginner.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28[/tpl]http://my.pages.de/pub/net/irc/history/
For a few days, the entire IRC network suffered frequent netsplits, but eventually the majority of servers added the Q-line and effectively created a new separate IRC net called EFnet (Eris-Free Network); the remaining servers which stayed connected to eris (and thus were no longer able to connect to EFnet servers) were called A-net (Anarchy Network). A-net soon vanished, leaving EFnet as the only IRC network.
Continuing problems with performance and abuse eventually led to the rise of another major IRC network, Undernet, which split off in October 1992.
In July 1996, disagreement on policy caused EFnet to break in two: the slightly larger European half (including Australia and Japan) formed IRCnet, while the American servers continued as EFnet. This was known as The Great Split.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irc.org/history_docs/TheGreatSplit.html |title=The Great Split |publisher=Irc.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28[/tpl]
In July 2001, after a string of DDoS attacks[tpl]cite web|url=http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&hl=en&js=y&u=http://www.onlinekosten.de/news/artikel/6280/0/Angriff-aufs-EFnet | date=December 7, 2001 |title=Attack on EFnet |publisher=OnlineKosten.de[/tpl][tpl]dubious|date=July 2012 [/tpl] a service called CHANFIX[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/ircd/chanfix.html |title=CHANFIX: EFnet op-less channel fixing |publisher=Irchelp.org |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2010-05-28[/tpl] (originally JUPES) was created, which is designed to give back ops to channels which have lost ops or been taken over.
In 2007, various EFnet servers began implementing SSL.[tpl]cite web|url=http://forum.efnet.org/ssl-test-t2131.html |title=EFnet IRC Network Forum â€¢ View topic - SSL test |publisher=Forum.efnet.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28[/tpl]
February 2009 saw the introduction of a new CHANFIX module called OPME, a mechanism for EFnet Admins to use to restore ops in an opless channel.[tpl]cite web|url=https://voting.efnet.org/proposals/opme.txt |title=CFV380 OPME |date=August 18, 2006|first=Douglas |last=Boldt|first2=Alan |last2=Milford|publisher=RFNet.org[/tpl] It provides a much cleaner alternative to masskill, which was unnecessarily invasive and disruptive to the network.
Later in 2009, some major IRC servers were delinked: irc.vel.net, irc.dks.ca, irc.pte.hu, EFnet's only UK server efnet.demon.co.uk, and EFnet's only UK hub hub.uk, which were sponsored by Demon Internet.
In September 2010, the two western regions of the network (United States and Canada) merged into the North American region. While the North American and European regions are technically independent of each other, today many issues within EFnet are handled at a global level.[tpl]cite web|url=http://forum.efnet.org/viewtopic.php?t=2756 |title=US and CA region merges into NA|author=Hardy |date=September 6, 2010|publisher=EFnet.org[/tpl][tpl]dubious|date=July 2012[/tpl]
In the last few years EFnet has lost a growing number of its original servers 2011.

==Characteristics==

EFnet has large variations in rules and policy between different servers as well as the two major regions (EU and NA). Both have their own policy structure, and each region votes on their own server applications. However, central policies are voted upon by the server admin community which is archived for referencing.EFnet voting site
Due to EFnet's nature, it has gained recognition over the years for warez,[tpl]cite news|first=Andy |last=Patrizio |url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2000/03/35141 |title=Forget Napster; IRC's the Place |publisher=Wired.com |date= 2000-03-27|accessdate=2010-05-28[/tpl] hackers,[tpl]cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/TECH/internet/04/10/hackers.chat.rooms/index.html | work=CNN | title=Experts: Chat rooms a haven for hackers | date=April 10, 2002 | accessdate=May 1, 2010[/tpl] and DoS attacks.[tpl]cite web|first=James |last=Middleton |url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2115605/efnet-eff-dos-attack |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081204084130/http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2115605/efnet-eff-dos-attack |archivedate=2008-12-04|title=EFNet eff'd off with DoS attack - V3.co.uk - formerly |publisher=Vnunet.com |date=July 13, 2001 |accessdate=2010-05-28[/tpl]
EFnet has always been known for its lack of IRC services that other IRC networks support (such as NickServ and ChanServ, although it had a NickServ until April 8, 1994[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=%22Bechar-Israeli+Haya%22&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=au&_pageLabel=RecordDetails&objectId=0900019b800fd604&accno=EJ515813&_nfls=false |title=From  to : Nicknames, Play, and Identity on Internet Relay Chat|first= Haya |last=Bechar-Israeli|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume= 1|issue= 2|date=November 1995[/tpl] (full text)). Instead, the CHANFIX service was introduced to fix "opless" channels.
Most servers on EFnet run ircd-ratbox with one running ircd-hybrid.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.efnet.org/ |title=Live Stats - EFnet IRC Network Statistics |publisher=Stats.efnet.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17[/tpl]
EFnet's channel operators are generally free to run their channels however they see fit without the intervention of IRCops. IRCops are primarily there to handle network and server related issues, and rarely get involved with channel-level issues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/ircd/ircopguide.html |title=IRC Operators Guide |publisher=Irchelp.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28[/tpl]
