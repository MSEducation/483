A polynomial function P(s) of a complex variable s is said to be Hurwitz if the following conditions are satisfied:
Hurwitz polynomials are important in control systems theory, because they represent the characteristic equations of stable linear systems.  Whether a polynomial is Hurwitz can be determined by solving the equation to find the roots, or from the coefficients without solving the equation by the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion.

==Examples==

A simple example of a Hurwitz polynomial is the following:
The only real solution is âˆ’1, as it factors to

==Properties==

For a polynomial to be Hurwitz, it is necessary but not sufficient that all of its coefficients be positive.  A necessary and sufficient condition that a polynomial is Hurwitz is that it pass the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion.  A given polynomial can be efficiently tested to be Hurwitz or not by using the Routh continued fraction expansion technique.
The properties of Hurwitz polynomials are:
