St. Paul's Episcopal Church is a small late Federal style brick church in Point of Rocks, Maryland, built in 1842. It is uniquely austere in an area where the typical country church is a frame or brick Gothic vernacular style.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mht.maryland.gov/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=460&COUNTY=Frederick&FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Frederick|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-06-07|work= National Register of Historic Places: Properties in Frederick County|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust[/tpl] The church was built by slaves from the nearby Duval plantation. During the Civil War the church's furnishings were stripped by Union troops who were using the church as a hospital.  Following the war the church vestry successfully sued the U.S. government for $1000 damages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hallowedground.org/component/option,com_jthg/theme,region/task,view/county,Frederick/Itemid,1/id,125/|title=St. Paul's Church|date=2008-10-03|work= Journey Through Hallowed Ground|publisher=The Journey Through Hallowed Ground Partnership[/tpl]
