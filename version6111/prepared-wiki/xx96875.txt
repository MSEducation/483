The Treaty of Córdoba established Mexican independence from Spain at the conclusion of the Mexican War of Independence. It was signed on August 24, 1821 in Córdoba, Veracruz, Mexico. The signatories were the head of the Army of the Three Guarantees, Agustín de Iturbide, and acting on behalf of the Spanish government, Jefe Político Superior Juan O'Donojú. The treaty has seventeen articles, which developed the proposals of the Plan of Iguala.Muñoz Saldaña, Rafael (2009) México Independiente: el despertar de una nación. Volume I. Mexico City, Televisa, p.140-141. ISBN 978-968-5963-25-1 The Treaty of Córdoba is the first document in which Spanish and Mexican officials accept the liberty of what will become the First Mexican Empire, although it is not today recognized as the foundational moment, since these ideas are often attributed to the Grito de Dolores (September 16, 1810). The treaty was rejected by Spanish government, publish this resolution in the Gaceta de Madrid on 13 and 14 February 1822.Arias, Op.cit., tomo IV, p.94 nota 1 http://www.archive.org/stream/mxicotravsde04tomorich#page/94/mode/2up 

==Objectives==

In the treaty, New Spain is recognized as an independent empire, which is defined as "monarchical, constitutional and moderate." The crown of the Mexican Empire was offered first to Ferdinand VII of Spain. Should he not present himself in Mexico within the time to be determined by the Mexican Cortes (parliament) to take the oath of office, the crown would then be offered in sequence to his brothers, the Infantes Carlos and Francisco, and cousin, Archduke Charles[ref]

In the case that none of these accept the crown (as indeed did happen), the treaty then established that Cortes can designate a new king without specifying if the person needed to belong to a European royal house.
The idea in this last clause had not been considered in the Plan of Iguala, and was conveniently added by Iturbide to leave open the possibility of his taking the crown. At the same time, O'Donojú, as captain general and jefe político superior, had no authority to sign such a treaty, but was interested in preserving Mexico for the Spanish royal family, and probably signed without considering that Iturbide might have designs on the crown.Riva Palacio, Vicente (1880) México a través de los siglos, Volume III, La guerra de independencia] p.740.

==Signing and consequences==

On September 27, 1821, the Army of the Three Guarantees entered triumphantly into Mexico City and on the following day the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire was promulgated. The Spanish Cortes did not accept the validity of the Plan of Iguala or the Treaty of Córdoba, and Spain did not recognize Mexican independence until December 1836.Mexican War of Independence Therefore, the Mexican Congress elected a Mexican monarch the following year. Iturbide was proclaimed emperor of Mexico on May 18, 1822.Álvarez Cuartero, Izaskun (2005) Visiones y revisiones de la independencia americana: México, Centroamérica y Haití, Series Aquilafuente volumen 84.
