[[Nontrinitarianism]]

Nontrinitarianism (or antitrinitarianism) refers to monotheistic belief systems, primarily within Christianity, which reject the mainstream Christian doctrine of the Trinity, namely, the teaching that God is three distinct hypostases or persons who are co-eternal, co-equal, and indivisibly united in one being or ousia.
According to churches that consider ecumenical council decisions final, trinitarianism was infallibly defined at the 4th-century ecumenical councils,Roger E. Olson, Christopher Alan Hall (Eerdmans 2002 ISBN 978-0-80284827-7), p. 15Roger E.

Livingstone (editors), The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ISBN 978-0-19280290-3), entry: "Arianism" disagreed with the Trinitarian formula of the Council of Nicaea. Nontrinitarians disagree with the findings of the Trinitarian Councils for various reasons, including the belief that the writings of the Bible take precedence over creeds (a view shared by the mainline Protestant churches, which on the contrary uphold the doctrine of the Trinity) or that there was a Great Apostasy prior to the Council. Church and State in Europe and the Middle East suppressed nontrinitarian belief as heresy from the 4th to 18th century, notably with regard to Arianism,http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/590747/Theodosius-Ihttp://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/urkunde-33 the teaching of Michael Servetushttp://www.xtimeline.com/evt/view.aspx?id=938690 and Catharism.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12976/Albigensian-Crusade Today nontrinitarians represent a minority of professed Christians.
Nontrinitarian views differ widely on the nature of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Various nontrinitarian views, such as Adoptionism, Monarchianism, and Subordinationism  existed prior to the formal definition of the Trinity doctrine in A.D. 325, 360, and 431, at the Councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, and Ephesus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma1.ii.iii.iii.html |title=History of Dogma|accessdate=2007-06-15|last=von Harnack|first=Adolf |authorlink=Adolf von Harnack|date=1894-03-01 |quote=the 2nd century, Jesus was either regarded as the man whom God hath chosen, in whom the Deity or the Spirit of God dwelt, and who, after being tested, was adopted by God and invested with dominion, (Adoptionist Christology); or Jesus was regarded as a heavenly spiritual being (the highest after God) who took flesh, and again returned to heaven after the completion of his work on earth (pneumatic Christology)[/tpl] Nontrinitarianism was later renewed in the Gnosticism of the Cathars in the 11th through 13th centuries, in the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, and in some groups arising during the Second Great Awakening of the 19th century.
Modern nontrinitarian Christian groups or denominations include Christadelphians, Christian Scientists, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Dawn Bible Students, Friends General Conference, Iglesia ni Cristo, Jehovah's Witnesses, Living Church of God, Oneness Pentecostals, Members Church of God International, Unitarian Universalist Christians, The Way International, The Church of God, International and the United Church of God. Also, all branches of Judaism are non-trinitarian, and consider the God of the Hebrew Scriptures to be one singular Person, with no divisions, or multi-persons within.  Islam considers Jesus to be a prophet but not divine.[tpl]cite book |title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam |last1=Glassé |first1=Cyril |last2=Smith |first2=Huston |year=2003 |publisher=Rowman Altamira |isbn=0759101906 |pages=239–241[/tpl] It has been described as anti-Trinitarian when compared to Christianity, or in books written for a Western audience: Islam teaches the absolute indivisibility of a supremely sovereign and transcendent god (see God in Islam),Encyclopedia of the Qur'an. Thomas, David. 2006. Volume V: Trinity. and is further distinctly antitrinitarian as several verses of the Qur'an teach that the doctrine of Trinity is blasphemous.Qur'an 3:79-80, 112:1-4, etc.

==Christianity==

The Christian Apologists and other Church Fathers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, having adopted and formulated the Logos Christology, considered the Son of God as the instrument used by the supreme God, the Father, to bring the creation into existence. Justin Martyr, Theophilus of Antioch, Hippolytus of Rome and Tertullian in particular state that the internal Logos of God (Gr. Logos endiathetos, Lat. ratio), that is his impersonal divine reason, was begotten as Logos uttered (Gr. Logos proforikos, Lat. sermo, verbum) and thus became a person to be used for the purpose of creation.Justo L. González, The Story of Christianity: The Early Church to the Present Day, Prince Press, 1984, Vol. 1, pp. 159-161• Jaroslav Pelikan, The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine, The University of Chicago Press, 1971, Vol. 1, pp. 181-199
The Encyclopædia Britannica states, "To some Christians the doctrine of the Trinity appeared inconsistent with the unity of God....They therefore denied it, and accepted Jesus Christ, not as incarnate God, but as God's highest creature by Whom all else was created....this view in the early Church long contended with the orthodox doctrine."Encyclopædia Britannica 1942 edition p.634 "Christianity" Although the nontrinitarian view eventually disappeared in the early Church and the Trinitarian view became an orthodox doctrine of modern Christianity, variations of the nontrinitarian view are still held by a small number of Christian groups and denominations.
Various views exist regarding the relationships between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

===Modern Christian groupings===

Nontrinitarian doctrine often generates controversy among mainstream Christians, as most trinitarians consider it heresy not to believe in the doctrine of the Trinity. At times, segments of Nicene Christianity reacted with ultimate severity toward nontrinitarian views. Following the Reformation, among some Protestant groups such as the Unitarians and Christadelphians, the same views have been accommodated.

===Unitarian Universalism===

Members of Unitarian Universalism may or may not identify as Christian. Traditionally, unitarianism was a form of Christianity that rejects the doctrine of the Trinity. Unitarianism was rebuffed by orthodox Christianity at the First Council of Nicaea in a Synod meeting of the bishops in 325, but resurfaced subsequently in Church history, especially during the theological turmoils of the Protestant Reformation. In 1961, the American Unitarian Association (AUA) was consolidated with the Universalist Church of America (UCA), forming the Unitarian Universalist Association.

==Judaism==

In all branches of Judaism, the God of the Hebrew Bible is considered one singular Person, with no divisions, or multi-persons within, and they reject the idea of a co-equal multi-personal Godhead or "Trinity", as actually against the Shema.  They do not consider the Hebrew word for "one" (that is "echad") as meaning anything other than a simple numerical one.Patrick Zukeran - Judaism - Judaism Today. Retrieved 21 June 2013.The Trinity and Deity of Jesus: What the Bible Really Teaches - Retrieved 21 June 2013.  Citing examples for "echad" in the Hebrew Scriptures as being either just one king, one house, one garden, one army, or one man, etc.  Also, they reject the notion that somehow there are "traces of the Trinity" in the Hebrew word "elohim".  Which in given contexts simply means "God" in superlative majesty, not necessarily "multipersonal godhead".  The Jewish polemics against the Trinity doctrine date almost from its very conception. Even in the Talmud, R. Simlai (3rd century) declared, in refutation of the "heretics," "The three words 'El,' 'Elohim,' and 'Yhwh' (Josh. xxii. 22) connote one and the same person, as one might say, 'King, Emperor, Augustus'" (Yer. Ber. ix. 12d).TRINITY: Jewish Encyclopedia. Retrieved 21 June 2013.

==Islam==

In Islam's holy book, the Quran, Allah (God) denounces the concept of Trinity (Qur'an 4:171, 5:72-73, 112) as an over-reverence by Christians of God's Word, the prophet and messiah Jesus Christ son of the virgin Mary, while maintaining Jesus as one of the most important and respected prophets and Messengers of God, (2:136) primarily sent to prevent the Jews from changing the Torah, (61:6) and to refresh and reaffirm his original message as revealed to Moses and earlier New Testament prophets. The creation of Jesus is framed similar to the creation of Adam out of dust, but with Jesus' birth meaning his creation excludes male human intervention rather than creation completely without human participation (3:59). Belief in all of the aforementioned about Jesus as a prophet (5:78), as well as belief in the original gospel and Torah and belief in Jesus' virgin birth (3:45) are core criterion of being a Muslim and Quranic criterion for salvation in the hereafter along with belief in the Prophet Muhammad and all the prior prophets. In short, God is seen as being both perfect and indivisible. He can therefore have no peer or equal. Jesus, being God's creation, can never be considered to be equal with God or a part of God. To do so is considered by Islam to be blasphemy.

==History==

===Early Christianity===

Most nontrinitarians take the position that the doctrine of the earliest form of Christianity (see Apostolic Age) was nontrinitarian, but (depending on which church) believe rather that early Christianity was either strictly Unitarian or Binitarian or Modalist. Typically, nontrinitarians believe Christianity was altered by the edicts of Emperor Constantine I, which eventually resulted in the adoption of Trinitarian Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire during the reign of Theodosius I.
Because it was during a dramatic shift in Christianity's status that the doctrine of the Trinity attained its definitive development, nontrinitarians typically consider the doctrine questionable. Nontrinitarians see the Nicene Creed as an essentially political document, resulting from the subordination of true doctrine to state interests by leaders of the Catholic Church, so that the church became, in their view, an extension of the Roman Empire.
Although nontrinitarian beliefs continued to multiply, and among some people (such as the Lombards in the west) were dominant for hundreds of years after their inception, Trinitarians gained prominence in the Roman Empire. Nontrinitarians typically argue that the primitive beliefs of Christianity were systematically suppressed [tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] (often to the point of death). Edict by Emperor Constantine against the Arians http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/urkunde-33
Some scholars investigating the historical Jesus assert that Jesus taught neither his own equality with God nor the Trinity (see, for example, the Jesus Seminar).
Nontrinitarians also dispute the veracity of the Nicene Creed based on its adoption nearly 300 years after the life of Jesus as a result of conflict within pre-Nicene early Christianity. Nontrinitarians (both Modalists and Unitarians) also generally say that Athanasius and others at Nicaea adopted Greek Platonic philosophy and concepts, and incorporated them in their views of God and Christ.David Bernard's The Oneness of God, Word Aflame Press, 1983, ISBN 0-912315-12-1. pgs 264-274. Nontrinitarians also cite scriptures such as [tpl]Bibleref2|Matthew|15:9[/tpl] and [tpl]Bibleref2|Ephesians|4:14[/tpl] that warn the reader to beware the doctrines of men.
The author H. G. Wells, later famous for his contribution to science-fiction, wrote in The Outline of History: "We shall see presently how later on all Christendom was torn by disputes about the Trinity. There is no evidence that the apostles of Jesus ever heard of the Trinity, at any rate from him."
The question of why such a central doctrine to the Christian faith would never have been explicitly stated in scripture or taught in detail by Jesus himself was sufficiently important to 16th century historical figures such as Michael Servetus as to lead them to argue the question. The Geneva City Council, in accord with the judgment of the cantons of Zürich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, condemned Servetus to be burned at the stake for this and his opposition to infant baptism.
The Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics describes the five stages that led to the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity.W. Fulton, ”Trinity”, Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, T. & T. Clark, 1921, Vol. 12, p. 459.

===Following the Reformation===

Following the Protestant Reformation, and the German Peasants' War of 1524–1525, by 1530 large areas of Northern Europe were Protestant, and forms of nontrinitarianism began to surface among some "Radical Reformation" groups, particularly Anabaptists. The first recorded English antitrinitarian was John Assheton (1548). The Italian humanist "Council of Venice" (1550) and the trial of Michael Servetus (1553) marked the clear emergence of markedly anti-Trinitarian Protestants. Though the only organised nontrinitarian churches were the Polish Brethren who split from the Calvinists (1565, expelled from Poland 1658), and the Unitarian Church of Transylvania (1568-today). Nonconformists, Dissenters and Latitudinarians in Britain were often Arians or Unitarians, and the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813 allowed nontrinitarian worship in Britain. In America Arian and Unitarian views were also found among some Millennialist and Adventist groups, though the Unitarian Church itself began to decline in numbers and influence after the 1870s.Unitarians face a new age: the report of the Commission of Appraisal. American Unitarian Association. ed. Frederick May Eliot, Harlan Paul Douglass - 1936 "Chapter III CHURCH GROWTH AND DECLINE DURING THE LAST DECADE Year Book data permit the calculation of growth or decline in membership for 297 Unitarian churches which existed throughout the last decade and ..."Charles Lippy ''Faith in America: Changes, Challenges, New Directions p2 2006 "However, when the national interest in novel religious forms waned by the mid- nineteenth century, Unitarianism and Universalism began to decline.2 For the vast majority of religious bodies in America, growth continued unabated;"

==Points of dissent==

Non-trinitarian Christians of Arian persuasion contend that the weight of Scriptural evidence leans more towards Subordinationism, that of the Son's total submission to the Father, and of Paternal supremacy over the Son in every aspect. They acknowledge and confess the Son's glorious and high rank, at God's right hand, but teach that the Father is still greater than the Son, in all things.
While acknowledging that the Father, Son, and Spirit are essential in creation and salvation, they argue that that in itself does not necessarily prove that they three are each co-equal or co-eternal. They also contend that the only number clearly ascribed to God in the Bible (both Testaments) is the number "one", and that the Trinity, literally meaning a set of three, ascribes a co-equal threeness to God that is not explicitly Scriptural.

===Scriptural support===

Critics argue that the Trinity, for a teaching described as fundamental, lacks direct scriptural support. Upholders of the doctrine declare that the doctrine is not stated directly in the New Testament, but is instead an interpretation of elements contained in it that are seen as implying the doctrine that was formulated only in the 4th century. Thus William Barclay says: "It is important and helpful to remember that the word Trinity is not itself a New Testament word. It is even true in at least one sense to say that the doctrine of the Trinity is not directly New Testament doctrine. It is rather a deduction from and an interpretation of the thought and the language of the New Testament."William Barclay, The Apostles' Creed (Westminster John Knox Press 1998 ISBN 978-0-66425826-9), p. 201 And the New Catholic Encyclopedia says: "The doctrine of the Holy Trinity is not taught explicitly in the Testament", "The formulation 'one God in three Persons' was not solidly established a council...prior to the end of the 4th century".New Catholic Encyclopedia (1967) Volume XIV p.299
Similarly, Encyclopedia Encarta states: "The doctrine is not taught explicitly in the New Testament, where the word God almost invariably refers to the Father. ... The term trinitas was first used in the 2nd century, by the Latin theologian Tertullian, but the concept was developed in the course of the debates on the nature of Christ .... In the 4th century, the doctrine was finally formulated".John Macquarrie, "Trinity," Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2005. © 1993-2004 Microsoft Corporation. Retrieved on March 31, 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica says: "Neither the word Trinity nor the explicit doctrine appears in the New Testament, nor did Jesus and his followers intend to contradict the Shema in the Old Testament: “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord” ([tpl]Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|6:4[/tpl]). ... The doctrine developed gradually over several centuries and through many controversies. ... by the end of the 4th century, under the leadership of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus (the Cappadocian Fathers), the doctrine of the Trinity took substantially the form it has maintained ever since.""Trinity," Encyclopædia Britannica 2004 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD. Retrieved on March 31, 2008. The Anchor Bible Dictionary states: "One does not find in the NT the trinitarian paradox of the coexistence of the Father, Son, and Spirit within a divine unity."Jouette M. Bassler, "God in the NT", The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Doubleday, New York 1992, 2:1055.
Speaking of legitimate theological development, Joseph F. Kelly writes: "The Bible may not use the word 'Trinity', but it refers to God the Father frequently; the Gospel of John emphasized the divinity of the Son; several New Testament books treat the Holy Spirit as divine The ancient theologians did not violate biblical teaching but sought to develop its implications. ... Arius's potent arguments forced other Christians to refine their thinking about the Trinity. at two ecumenical councils, Nicea I in 325 and Constantinople I in 381, the church at large defined the Trinity in the way now so familiar to us from the Nicene Creed. This exemplifies development of doctrine at its best. The Bible may not use the word 'Trinity', but trinitarian theology does not go against the Bible. On the contrary, Catholics believe that trinitarianism has carefully developed a biblical teaching for later generations."Joseph F. Kelly, An Introduction to the New Testament for Catholics (Liturgical Press 2006 ISBN 978-0-81465216-9), pp. 4-5

===Questions over the alleged co-equal deity of Jesus===

Nontrinitarians[tpl]who|date=October 2013[/tpl] say that there is no clear Scriptural backing for the doctrine of the co-equal divinity of Jesus. They point to verses that purport to demonstrate that Jesus himself explicitly stated that "the Father is greater" than he ([tpl]Bibleref2|John|14:28[/tpl]); that he disavowed omniscience as the Son ([tpl]Bibleref2|John|8:28[/tpl]; in [tpl]Bibleref2|Mark|13:32[/tpl]), that he "learned obedience" ([tpl]Bibleref2|Hebrews|5:8[/tpl]); questioned being called even "good" in deference to God in the parable of the rich young ruler ([tpl]Bibleref2|Matthew|19:16-17[/tpl]); they say that only the Father in Scripture is referred to as the "one God", and "out of (ex) whom all things are" ([tpl]Bibleref2|1 Corinthians|8:6[/tpl]); that Christ the Son is called the 'firstborn of all creation' ([tpl]Bibleref2|Colossians|1:15[/tpl]) and 'the beginning of God's creation' ([tpl]Bibleref2|Revelation|3:14[/tpl]); that Jesus referred to ascending to "my Father, and to your Father; and to my God, and to your God" ([tpl]Bibleref2|John|20:17[/tpl]) and that he referred to his Father as "the only true God." ([tpl]Bibleref2|John|17:3[/tpl])
Additionally, Jesus quoted [tpl]Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|6:4[/tpl] when saying in [tpl]Bibleref2|Mark|12:29[/tpl] [tpl]"'[/tpl]The most important commandment is this: Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.[tpl]'"[/tpl] It has been stated[tpl]By whom|date=March 2012[/tpl] that in the original Greek in Mark 12, there are no "plural modifiers" in that Greek word there for "one" (eis), but that in Mark 12 it is simply a masculine singular "one". And that because of that, there is no valid reason to believe that the Hebrew word for "one" in Deuteronomy 6 ("echad") was necessarily a "plural one", rather than just simply numerical "one".
They also argue to show that "Elohim" (sometimes translated "gods") does not hint at any form of plurality, but rather to majesty pointing to the Hebrew dialect and grammar rules that render this title in nearly all circumstances with a singular verb.
With regard to the New Testament, Raymond E. Brown, a Catholic and Trinitarian, wrote that [tpl]Bibleref2|Mark|10:18[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|Matthew|27:46[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|John|20:17[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|Ephesians|1:17[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|2Cor|1:3|niv|2 Corinthians 1:3[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|1Pe|1:3|niv|1 Peter 1:3[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|John|17:3[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|1Cor|8:6|niv|1 Corinthians 8:6[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|Ephesians|4:4-6[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|1cor|12:4-6|niv|1 Corinthians 12:4-6[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|2cor|13:14|niv|2 Corinthians 13:14[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|1tim|2:5|niv|1 Timothy 2:5[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|John|14:28[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|Mark|13:32[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|Philippians|2:5-10[/tpl], and [tpl]Bibleref2|1cor|15:24-28|niv|1 Corinthians 15:24-28[/tpl] are "texts that seem to imply that the title God was not used for Jesus" and are "negative evidence which is often somewhat neglected in Catholic treatments of the subject"; that [tpl]Bibleref2|Gal|2:20[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|Acts|20:28[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|John|1:18[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|Colossians|2:2[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|2 Thessalonians|1:12[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|1John|5:20[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref|Romans|9:5[/tpl], and [tpl]Bibleref2|2 Peter|1:1[/tpl] are "texts where, by reason of textual variants or syntax, the use of 'God' for Jesus is dubious"; and that [tpl]Bibleref2|Hebrews|1:8-9[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref|John|1:1[/tpl], and [tpl]Bibleref2|John|20:28[/tpl] are "texts where clearly Jesus is called God".Theological Studies #26 (1965) p. 545-73, "Does the New Testament call Jesus God?"
Trinitarians (who hold that Jesus Christ is distinct from God the Father), and nontrinitarians who hold Jesus Christ as Almighty God (such as the Modalists), say that these statements are based on Jesus' existence as the Son of God in human flesh; that he is therefore both God and man, who became "lower than the angels, for our sake," ([tpl]Bibleref2|Hebrews|2:6-8[/tpl]) and that he was tempted as humans are tempted, but did not sin ([tpl]Bibleref2|Hebrews|4:14-16[/tpl]).
Some nontrinitarians counter the belief that the Son was limited only during his earthly life by citing "the head of Christ is God" ([tpl]Bibleref2|1cor|11:3|kjv|1 Corinthians 11:3[/tpl]), placing Jesus in an inferior position to the Father even after his resurrection and exaltation. They also cite [tpl]Bibleref2|Acts|5:31[/tpl] and [tpl]Bibleref2|Philippians|2:9[/tpl], indicating that Jesus became glorified and exalted after ascension to heaven, and to [tpl]Bibleref2|Hebrews|9:24[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleref2|Acts|7:55[/tpl], and [tpl]Bibleref2|1cor|15:24,28|niv|1 Corinthians 15:24, 28[/tpl], regarding Jesus as a distinct personality in heaven, still with a lesser position than the Father, all after Christ's ascension.

====Views on allegedly Trinitarian passages in scripture====

Non-trinitarian Christians such as Jehovah's Witnesses argue that a person who is really seeking to know the truth about God is not going to search the Bible hoping to find a text that he can construe as fitting what he already believes. They say it is noteworthy at the outset that the texts used as “proof” of the Trinity do not explicitly teach co-equality or co-eternity in any clear formulation, and also that most of those Verses in question actually mention only two persons, not three; so nontrinitarians say that even if the trinitarian explanation of the texts were correct, these would not prove that the Bible teaches the Trinity.Reasoning from Scriptures, Watch Tower bible and tract society page 411 para 4

====John 1:1====

John 1:1 - The contention with this verse is that there is a distinction between God and the Logos (or "the Word"). Trinitarians contend that the third part of the verse (John 1:1c) translates as "and the Word was God", pointing to a distinction as subjects between God and the Logos but an equivalence in nature.Colin G. Kruse, The Gospel According to John (Eerdmans 2004 ISBN 978-0-80282771-5), p. 62J. Ramsey Michaels, John (Baker Books 2011 ISBN 978-1-44123659-3)Earl Radmacher, Nelson's New Illustrated Bible Commentary (Thomas Nelson Inc. 1999 ISBN 978-1-41858734-50)Robert H. Gundry, Commentary of John (Baker Academic 2011 ISBN 978-1-44123761-3) Nontrinitarians contend that the Koine Greek ("kai theos ên ho logos") should instead be translated as "and the Word was a god", or as what they see as the more literal word-for-word translation from the Greek as "and a God was the Word", basing this on the contention that the section is an example of an anarthrous, that is, "theos" lacks the definite article, meaning its use was indefinite - "a god", which could denote either Almighty God or a divine being in general. Nontrinitarians also contend that had the author of John's gospel wished to say "and the Word was God" that he could have easily written "kai ho theos ên ho logos", but he did not. In this way, nontrinitarians contend that the Logos would be considered to be the pre-existent Jesus, who is actually distinct from God.  The argument being that the distinction between the Logos and the Father was not just in terms of "person", but also in terms of "theos".Patrick Navas - Divine Truth Or Human Tradition?: A Reconsideration Of The Orthodox Doctrine Of The Trinity in Light of the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures - AuthorHouse, 2007, 2011 - p 267.[tpl]verify credibility|date=December 2013|reason=self-published[/tpl]
Meaning that not only were they distinct persons, but also distinct "Gods", given the fact that the second occurrence of "theos" was an indefinite noun; and that only the Father was treated as the absolute "Theos" in John 1:1.  The argument being that only one person is actually referred to as the Absolute God, "ho Theos", in John 1:1, that person being only the Father, not the Logos.[tpl]verify credibility|date=December 2013|reason=self-published[/tpl]    Alternatively, others argue that the Greek should be translated as "and the Logos was divine" (with theos being an adjective), and the Logos being interpreted as God's "plan" or "reasoning" for salvation. Thus, according to Modalists, when "the Logos became flesh" in [tpl]bibleverse|John||1:14|KJV[/tpl], it is not interpreted to be a pre-existent Jesus being incarnated, but rather the "plan" or "eternal mind" of God being manifested in the birth of the man Jesus.

====John 10:30====

[tpl]bibleref2|John|10:30[/tpl] - Nontrinitarians such as Arians believe that when Jesus said, "I and the Father are one," he did not mean that they were actually "one substance", or "one God", or co-equal and co-eternal, but rather that, according to context, which was that of shepherding the sheep, he and the Father were "one" in pastoral work. The thought being a "unity of purpose" in saving the sheep. Arians also cite [tpl]bibleref2|John|17:21[/tpl] where Jesus prayed regarding his disciples: “That they may all be one, as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they may be in us,” adding “that they may be one even as we are one.” They point out that Jesus used the same Greek word (hen) for "one" in all these instances and assert that since Jesus did not expect for his followers to literally become "one" entity, or "one in substance", with each other, or with God, then it is said that Jesus also did not expect his hearers to think that he and God the Father were "one" entity either. Rather Arian nontrinitarians insist that the oneness meant in that context was a oneness in divine work, mission, love and purpose.

====John 20:28-29====

[tpl]bibleref2|John|20:28-29[/tpl] - "And Thomas answered and said to Him, "My Lord and my God!" Jesus said to him, "Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed"". Since Thomas called Jesus God, Jesus's statement appears to endorse Thomas's assertion. Nontrinitarians typically respond that it is plausible that Thomas is addressing the Lord Jesus and then the Father. Another possible answer is that Jesus himself said, "Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?"
([tpl]bibleref2|John|10:34[/tpl]) referring to Psalm 82:6-8. The word "gods" in verse 6 and "God" in verse 8 is the same Hebrew word "'elohim",http://www.biblicalheritage.org/Linguistic/HL/1-A/-elohiym.htm which means, "gods in the ordinary sense; but specifically used (in the plural thus, especially with the article) of the supreme God; occasionally applied by way of deference to magistrates; and sometimes as a superlative",http://strongsnumbers.com/hebrew/430.htm and can also refer to powers and potentates, in general, or as "God, god, gods, rulers, judges or angels", and as "divine ones, goddess, godlike one".http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?number=0430
[tpl]Original research|paragraph|date=December 2013[/tpl]The notion being that since Christ represented God the Father perfectly, and was given power and authority by the Father, therefore Christ was "God", over the circumstances, similar to how Moses was called "God" in Exodus 7:1, because Moses was given divine power, and was "Elohim" to the people, over the situation. And that therefore Jesus was a "God" to Thomas, or a powerful being in that situation, as a perfect reflection of the Father's divine power. But still not necessarily co-equal with the Father in everything, just as Moses wasn't.  The first explanation is perhaps the most plausible, in that the Greek forms used in the text do not denote two descriptions of one personage, but two personages described separately. A nontrinitarian would link this witnessing of Thomas to Jesus's saying that, to paraphrase, "He who sees me, sees the Father", and would say that this text affirms the doctrine that Jesus is Lord but only God the Father is absolute deity, and hence the Lord of Jesus. Because "no one can come to the Father except through me (Jesus)", it is necessary however to call Jesus "Lord" (a requirement of belief in the New Testament), which is exactly what Thomas did when he believed.

====2 Corinthians 13:14====

[tpl]bibleref2|2 Corinthians|13:14[/tpl] - "The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the sharing in the Holy Spirit be with all of you."  It's been argued by Trinitarians that since, in this verse, all three "Father, Son, and Spirit" are mentioned together in Paul's prayer for Grace on all believers, and are obviously essential for salvation, that they must make up one triune Godhead, and must therefore be co-equal or co-eternal.  Nontrinitarians such as Arians reply that they do not disagree that all three are necessary for salvation and grace, but nowhere in the passage is it explicitly said that all three are co-equal or co-eternal, or even have to be.  They argue that it is simply a circular assumption that just because they are mentioned together and are important, that they must ipso facto make up one co-equal Godhead.2 Corinthians 13:14 – Trinity?
They point to other verses in the Bible that mention God, Christ, and the "Holy Angels" together in important solemn situations and oaths, and argue that no one believes that therefore the "holy angels" must be part of a co-equal Godhead, simply because they're mentioned along with Christ or God.  And nontrinitarians remark that, though some passages mention Father, Son, and Spirit together, nowhere do those verses say that the Father is still not supreme or above all.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

====Philippians 2:5-6====

[tpl]bibleref2|Philippians|2:5-6[/tpl] - "Keep this mind in you that was also in Christ Jesus, who although existing in God's form, did not think to seize being equal with God".  Since the King James Bible renders it as "who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God" it's been considered by Trinitarians[tpl]who|date=December 2013[/tpl]  that this Verse teaches co-equality with the Father. However, it's been argued by nontrinitarians that this is a mistranslation and misleading rendering, conveying a thought essentially opposite of what was actually said.ERRORS IN THE KING JAMES VERSION NO. 4 - ROBBERY
[tpl]Original research|paragraph|date=December 2013[/tpl]The actual meaning of it being that Christ simply never thought of seizing or grasping equality with God, but was humble to the point of taking a slave's form and dying on earth.   Also, the expression "form of God", nontrinitarians say, is actually without the definite article, literally saying that Christ existed in "a" form of God.  The thought being that God is Spirit, and the Bible teaches that angels are also spirits, and can be said to exist in "God's form", and that if Christ was a pre-existent Arch-Angel, and was spirit, then in that sense it can be said that Christ was existing in a "form of God".  Nontrinitarians contend that Philippians 2, especially in the original Greek, does not clearly teach actual co-equality or con-substantiality with the Father, and also say that, later in the passage, everything is done ultimately "to the glory of God the Father".

====Hebrews 9:14====

[tpl]bibleref2|Hebrews|9:14[/tpl] - "How much more will the Blood of Christ, who through an eternal Spirit, offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works, that we may render sacred service to the living God?"  Trinitarians and Athanasians have used this verse as a proof-text that since all three are mentioned together, and all are essential in the plan of salvation and atonement, that because of that, are each eternal God.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]  Most nontrinitarians admit that the Holy Spirit had no beginning, but believe it is not an actual person like the Father is.  Nontrinitarians also agree that all three are essential, but contend that it's obvious that God the Father is ultimate, and is the one who is ultimately reached, and therefore, although all are divine and essential, the "living God" the Father is still greater than the other two entities. And that a "co-equal trinity" is still not explicitly taught in the passage, but only inferred or assumed.Is God a Trinity?

===Terminology===

Nontrinitarians state that the doctrine of the Trinity relies on non-Biblical terminology, that the term "Trinity" is not found in Scripture and that the number three is never clearly associated with God necessarily, other than within the Comma Johanneum which is of spurious or disputed authenticity. They argue that the only number clearly unambiguously ascribed to God in the Bible is one, and that the Trinity, literally meaning three-in-one, ascribes a co-equal threeness to God that is not explicitly biblical.
Nontrinitarians cite other examples of terms not found in the Bible; multiple "persons" in relation to God, the terms "God the Son", "God-Man", "God the Holy Spirit", "eternal Son", and "eternally begotten". While the Trinitarianism term hypostasis is found in the Bible, it is used only once in reference to God [tpl]bibleref2c|Heb|1:3[/tpl] where it states that Jesus is the express image of God's person. The Bible does not explicitly use the term in relation to the Holy Spirit nor explicitly mentions the Son having a distinct hypostasis from the Father.
All agree that the First Council of Nicaea included in its Creed the major term homoousios (of the same essence), which was used also by the Council of Chalcedon to speak of a double consubstantiality of Christ, "consubstantial with the Father as touching his Godhead, and consubstantial with us as touching his manhood".The Chalcedonian Definition Nontrinitarians accept what Pier Franco Beatrice wrote: "The main thesis of this paper is that homoousios came straight from Constantine's Hermetic background. ... The Plato recalled by Constantine is just a name used to cover precisely the Egyptian and Hermetic theology of the "consubstantiality" of the Logos-Son with the Nous-Father, having recourse to a traditional apologetic argument. ... Constantine's Hermetic interpretation of Plato's theology and consequently the emperor's decision to insert homoousios in the Creed of Nicaea."The Word "Homoousios" from Hellenism to Christianity, by P.F. Beatrice, Church History, Cambridge University Press on behalf of the American Society of Church History, Vol. 71, No. 2, (Jun., 2002), pp. 243-272. (retrieved @ noemon.net)[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Trinitarians see the absence of the actual word "Trinity" and other Trinity-related terms in the Bible as no more significant than the absence in the Bible of the words "monotheism", "omnipotence", "oneness", "Pentecostal", "apostolic", "incarnation" and even "Bible" itself.Matt Slick, "The word Trinity is not found in the Bible"Oneill McQuick, The Voice (LIM Publishing 2005 ISBN 978-1-41961730-0), p. 222 and maintain that, "while the word Trinity is not in the Bible, the substance of the doctrine is definitely biblical".Robert Bowman, Jr., "The Biblical Basis of the Doctrine of the Trinity"

===Holy Spirit===

It is also argued that the vast majority of scriptures that Trinitarians offer in support of their beliefs refer to the Father and to Son, but not to the Holy Spirit. Some nontrinitarians, including Jehovah's Witnesses, believe that the Holy Spirit is not an actual person but rather the divine energy or active force of God.What Does God Require Of Us (published by Jehovah's Witnesses) http://watchtower.org/e/rq/ lesson 2 paragraph 3 "What, though, is the holy spirit? It is not a person like God. Rather, it is God's active force.—Psalm 104:30. "

===Non-Trinitarian views of the Holy Spirit===

Non-trinitarian views about the Holy Spirit differ in certain ways from mainstream Christian doctrine and generally fall into several distinct categories.

====Unitarian and Arian====

Groups with Unitarian theology such as Polish Socinians, the 18th-19th Century Unitarian Church, Christadelphians conceive of the Holy Spirit not as a person but an aspect of God's power.The Unitarian: a monthly magazine of liberal Christianity ed. Jabez Thomas Sunderland, Brooke Herford, Frederick B. Mott - 1893 "We believe in the Holy Spirit, man's sole reliance for guidance, safety, or salvation, not as a separate person, entity, reality, or consciousness, existent apart from man or God, but as the recognizing sympathetic inter-communication in love between God and the human soul, the direct converse or communion of man's consciousness with Deity." Christadelphians believe that the phrase Holy Spirit refers to God's power or mind/character, depending on the context.[tpl]cite book | last = Broughton | first = James H. | authorlink = | coauthors = Peter J Southgate | title = The Trinity: True or False? | publisher = The Dawn Book Supply | location = UK | pages = | url = http://www.biblelight.org/trin/trinind.htm | doi = | id = | isbn = [/tpl]
Though Arius himself believed that the Holy Spirit is a person or high-ranking Angel, that had a beginning, modern Arian or Semi-Arian Christian groups such as Dawn Bible Students and Jehovah's Witnesses believe, the same as Unitarian groups, that the Holy Spirit is not an actual person but is God's "power in action", like God's divine "breath" or "energy", which had no beginning, that he uses to accomplish his will and purpose in creation, redemption, sanctification, and divine guidance, and they do not typically capitalize the term.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Awake!|title=Is the Holy Spirit a Person?|date=July 2006|pages=14–15 |url=http://www.watchtower.org/e/200607a/article_01.htm|quote=In the Bible, God’s Holy Spirit is identified as God’s power in action. Hence, an accurate translation of the Bible’s Hebrew text refers to God’s spirit as “God’s active force.”[/tpl] They define the Holy Spirit as "God's active force", and they believe that it proceeds only from the Father. A Jehovah's Witness brochure quotes Alvan Lamson: "...the Father, Son, and... Holy Spirit are not as co-equal, not as one numerical essence, not as Three in One... The very reverse is the fact.""Is It Clearly a Bible Teaching?", Should You Believe in the Trinity?, ©1989 Watch Tower, p. 7, Reproduced here.

====Binitarianism====

Armstrongites, such as the Living Church of God, believe that the Logos and God the Father are co-equal and co-eternal, but they do not believe that the Holy Spirit is an actual person, like the Father and the Son. They believe the Holy Spirit is the Power, Mind, or Character of God, depending on the context. They  teach, "The Holy Spirit is the very essence, the mind, life and power of God. It is not a Being. The Spirit is inherent in the Father and the Son, and emanates from Them throughout the entire universe". Mainstream Christians characterise this teaching as the heresy of Binitarianism, the teaching that God is a "Duality", or "two-in-one", rather than three.Who and What Is God? - Mystery of the Ages - Herbert W. Armstrong. Retrieved 19 May 2012.

====Modalist groups====

Oneness Pentecostalism, as with other modalist groups, teach that the Holy Spirit is a mode of God, rather than a distinct or separate person in the Godhead. They instead teach that the Holy Spirit is another name for God the Father. According to Oneness theology, the Holy Spirit essentially is the Father, operating in a certain capacity or manifestation. The United Pentecostal Church teaches that there is no personal distinction between God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.Peter Althouse Spirit of the last days: Pentecostal eschatology in conversation p12 2003 "The Oneness Pentecostal stream follows in the steps of the Reformed stream, but has a modalistic view of the Godhead"See under heading "The Father is the Holy Ghost" in David Bernard, The Oneness of God, Chapter 6.See also David Bernard, A Handbook of Basic Doctrines, Word Aflame Press, 1988.
These two titles "Father" and "Holy Spirit" (as well as others) do not reflect separate "persons" within the Godhead, but rather two different ways in which the one God reveals himself to his creatures. Thus, the Old Testament speaks of "The Lord God and his Spirit" in Isaiah 48:16, but this does not indicate two "persons" according to Oneness theology. Rather, "The Lord" indicates God in all of His glory and transcendence, while the words "His Spirit" refer to God's own Spirit that moved upon and spoke to the prophet. The Oneness view is that this does not imply two "persons" any more than the numerous scriptural references to a man and his spirit or soul (such as in Luke 12:19) imply two "persons" existing within one body.See under "The Lord God and His Spirit," in Chapter 7 of David Bernard, The Oneness of God.

====Latter-day Saints====

In the Latter-day Saint movement, the Holy Ghost (usually synonymous with Holy Spirit.)[tpl]Cite book |last= Wilson |first= Jerry A. |contribution= Holy Spirit |title= Encyclopedia of Mormonism |year= 1992 |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H. |publisher= Mcmillan |location= New York |isbn= 0-02-904040-X |url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/EoM,3768 |page= 651 |quote= The Holy Spirit is a term often used to refer to the Holy Ghost.

Latter-day Saints believe that the Holy Spirit is part of the "Divine Council", but that the Father is greater than both the Son and the Holy Spirit.  According to official Latter-day Saint teaching, the Father, Son, and Spirit are three distinct "Gods" joined in purpose as "one Godhead". Because of this, some view Latter-day Saint theology as a form of "tri-theism".

====Judaism====

The "holy spirit" (also transliterated ruah ha-qodesh) is a term used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and Jewish writings to refer to the Spirit of Yehowah.  (The expression in Hebrew is: יהוה  .קָדְשְׁך) The Hebrew term ruakh kodeshka, without the definite article, also occurs. The Holy Spirit in Judaism generally refers to the divine aspect of prophecy and wisdom. It also refers to the divine force, quality, and influence of the Most High God, over the universe or over his creatures, in given contexts.Alan Unterman and Rivka Horowitz,Ruah ha-Kodesh, Encyclopedia Judaica (CD-ROM Edition, Jerusalem: Judaica Multimedia/Keter, 1997). It is not considered a separate person of God, but rather God's divine wisdom, breath, or moving power.

====Other groups====

The Unity Church interprets the religious terms Father, Son, and Holy Spirit metaphysically, as three aspects of mind action: mind, idea, and expression. They believe this is the process through which all manifestation takes place.http://www.unitypaloalto.org/beliefs/twenty_questions.html[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]
As a movement that developed out of Christianity, Rastafari has its own unique interpretation of both the Holy Trinity and the Holy Spirit. Although there are several slight variations, they generally state that it is Haile Selassie who embodies both God the Father and God the Son, while the Holy (or rather, "Hola") Spirit is to be found within Rasta believers (see 'I and I'), and within every human being. Rastas also say that the true church is the human body, and that it is this church (or "structure") that contains the Holy Spirit.

===Inter-religious dialogue===

The Trinity doctrine is integral in inter-religious disagreements with the other two main Abrahamic religions, Judaism and Islam; the former rejects Jesus' divine mission entirely, and the latter accepts Jesus as a human prophet and the Messiah but not as the son of God. The concept of a co-equal trinity is totally rejected, with Quranic verses calling the doctrine of the Trinity blasphemous.[tpl]cite book|title=The Holy Qur'an|location=4:171[/tpl] Many[tpl]Who|date=March 2012[/tpl] within Judaism and Islam[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] also accuse Christian Trinitarians of practicing polytheism—believing in three gods rather than just one.

==Purported pagan origins[tpl]anchor|Pagan origin[/tpl]==

Those who argue for a pagan basis note that as far back as Babylonia, the worship of pagan gods grouped in threes, or triads, was common, and that this influence was also prevalent among the Celts, as well as in Egypt, Greece, and Rome[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl].  The ancient Egyptians, whose influence on early religious thought was considered profound, usually arranged their gods and goddesses in groups of three, or trinities: there was the trinity of Osiris, Isis, and Horus, the trinity of Amen, Mut, and Khonsu, and the trinity of Khnum, Satis, and Anukis.
In ancient India, the concept of the trio—Brahma the creator, Shiva the destroyer, and Vishnu the preserver dates back to millennia before Christ.[ref]HINDU TRINITY 
Lord Brahma | Lord Vishnu | Lord Shiva - Rudra Centre - Retrieved 26 March 2014[/ref]E. Washburn Hopkins - ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF RELIGION - THE HINDU TRINITY - urantia-book.org. Retrieved 26 March 2014. This triad of 3 gods is regarded as Trimurti, meaning 'tri' = three and 'murti' = figure, manifestation. A number of triads can be found in Hindu scriptures such as Vedas, Upanishads, among others.[tpl]cite book|title=The Bhagavadgītā and St. John of the Cross: A Comparative Study of the Dynamism of Spiritual Growth in the Process of God-realisation|page=340|year=1996|author=Rudolf V. D'Souza|publisher=Gregorian Biblical[/tpl]
Some nontrinitarians[tpl]who|date=November 2010[/tpl] also say that a link between the doctrine of the Trinity and the Egyptian Christian theologians of Alexandria suggests that Alexandrian theology, with its strong emphasis on the deity of Jesus, served to infuse Egypt's pagan religious heritage into Christianity. They charge the Church with adopting these Egyptian tenets after adapting them to Christian thinking by means of Greek philosophy.'At times he forms one of a trinity in unity, with Ra and Osiris, as in Fig. 87, a god with the two sceptres of Osiris, the hawk's head of Horus, and the sun of Ra. This is the god described to Eusebius, who tells us that when the oracle was consulted about the divine nature, by those who wished to understand this complicated mythology, it had answered, "I am Apollo and Lord and Bacchus," or, to use the Egyptian names, "I am Ra and Horus and Osiris." Another god, in the form of a porcelain idol to be worn as a charm, shows us Horus as one of a trinity in unity, in name, at least, agreeing with that afterwards adopted by the Christians--namely, the Great God, the Son God, and the Spirit God.'—Samuel Sharpe, Egyptian Mythology and Egyptian Christianity, 1863, pp. 89-90.
They say that there was much pagan Greek and Platonic influence in the development of the idea of a co-equal triune Godhead, many basic concepts from Aristotelian philosophy being mixed and incorporated into the Biblical God.  As one piece of evidence, they say that Aristotle himself wrote: "All things are three, and thrice is all: and let us use this number in the worship of the gods; for, as Pythagoreans say, everything and all things are bound by threes, for the end, the middle, and the beginning have this number in everything, and these compose the number of the Trinity."Website of United Church of God, "How Ancient Trinitarian Gods Influenced Adoption of the Trinity"Michael Barber - Should Christianity Abandon the Doctrine of the Trinity? - Universal-Publishers, Nov 1, 2006 - Part Three - Page 78.
The words thus attributed to Aristotle differ in a number of ways from what has been published as the philosopher's original text in Greek,the Greek WikisourceΠερὶ Οὐρανοῦ Α'Bekker edition of Aristotle's works, volume II, p. 211 which for instance has nothing corresponding to "let us use this number in the worship of the gods" before the mention of the Pythagoreans. They differ also from translations of the works of Aristotle by scholars such as Stuart Leggatt, W. K. C. Guthrie, J. L. Stocks, Thomas Taylor and Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire. The independent but concordant translations by Guthrie and Stocks of what Aristotle, in his On the Heavens, wrote about what he considered to be the only three dimensions are considered "good English translations",The Philosophical Review, Vol. 108, No. 2 (April 1999), p. 285 and a comparison with them of the words above attributed to Aristotle shows how the latter diverges.
The Guthrie translation is: "Magnitude divisible in one direction is a line, in two directions is a surface, and in three directions is a body. There is no magnitude not included in these; for three are all, and 'in three directions' is the same as 'in every direction'. It is just as the Pythagoreans say, the whole world and all things in it are summed up in the number three; for end, middle, and beginning give the number of the whole, and their number is the triad. Hence it is that we have taken this number from nature, as if it were her laws, and we make use of it even for the worship of the gods."Phillip Sidney Horky, Plato's Magnesia and Philosophical Polities in Magna Graecia (ProQuest 2007 ISBN 978-0-54923690-0), p. 35
The Stocks translation is: "A magnitude if divisible one way is a line, if two ways a surface, and if three a body. Beyond these there is no other magnitude, because the three dimensions are all that there are, and that which is divisible in three directions is divisible in all. For, as the Pythagoreans say, the world and all that is in it is determined by the number three, since beginning and middle and end give the number of an 'all', and the number they give is the triad. And so, having taken these three from nature as (so to speak) laws of it, we make further use of the number three in the worship of the gods."Translation by J.L. Stokes, hosted by various sites that include that of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Some anti-Trinitarians note also that the Greek philosopher Plato believed in a special "threeness" in life and in the universe.  In Plato's work Phaedo, he introduces the word "triad" (in Greek τριάς),Plato, Phaedo translated by G.M.A. Grube which they translate as "trinity". Plato believed and taught that the Ultimate Reality was a "trinity of divine forms", of the One, Nous, Psyche.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] This was adopted by 3rd and 4th century professed Christians as roughly corresponding to "Father, Word, and Spirit (Soul)".Course of Ideas, pp 387-8. Non-trinitarian Christians contend that such notions and adoptions make the Trinity doctrine more suspect, as not being Biblical, but extra-Biblical in concept.
As evidence of this, they say there is a widely acknowledged synthesis of Christianity with Platonic philosophy evident in Trinitarian formulas appearing by the end of the 3rd century. Hence, beginning with the Constantinian period, they allege, these pagan ideas were forcibly imposed on the churches as Catholic doctrine rooted firmly in the soil of Hellenism. Most groups subscribing to the theory of a Great Apostasy generally concur in this thesis.
The early apologists, including Justin Martyr, Tertullian and Irenaeus, frequently discussed the parallels and contrasts between Christianity, Paganism and other syncretic religions, and answered charges of borrowing from paganism in their apologetical writings.

===Hellenic influences===

Advocates of the "Hellenic influences" argument attempt to trace the influence of Greek philosophers, such as Plato or Aristotle, who, they say, taught an essential "threeness" of the Ultimate Reality, and also the concept of "eternal derivation", that is, "a birth without a becoming". They say that theologians of the 4th century A.D., such as Athanasius of Alexandria, then interpreted the Bible through a Middle Platonist and later Neoplatonist filter.
The argument is that many of these 3rd and 4th-century Christians mixed Greek pagan philosophy with the Scriptures, incorporating Platonism into their concept of the Biblical God and the Biblical Christ.  These advocates point to what they see as similarities between Hellenistic philosophy and post-Apostolic Christianity, by examining the following factors:
 "The Christian apologists as Justin Martyr and Irenaeus began to claim that Greek culture pointed to and was consummated in the Christian message, just as the Old Testament was. This process was done most thoroughly in the synthesis of Clement of Alexandria. It can be done in several ways. You can rake through Greek literature, and find (especially in the oldest seers and poets) references to ‘God’ which are more compatible with monotheism than with polytheism (so at length Athenagoras.) You can work out a common chronology between the legends of prehistoric (Homer) Greece and the biblical record (so Theophilus.) You can adapt a piece of pre-Christian Jewish apologetic, which claimed that Plato and other Greek philosophers got their best ideas indirectly from the teachings of Moses in the Bible, which was much earlier. This theory combines the advantage of making out the Greeks to be plagiarists (and therefore second-rate or criminal), while claiming that they support Christianity by their arguments at least some of the time. Especially this applied to the question of God."
