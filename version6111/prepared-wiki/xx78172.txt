[[Flag of Guinea]]

CATEGORIES: National symbols of Guinea, Flags of Africa

The flag of Guinea was adopted on 10 November 1958.

==History==

The colors of the flag were adapted from those of the Rassemblement DÃ©mocratique Africain, the dominant movement at the time of independence. The colors were in turn derived from those of Ghana, which had first adopted them in 1957. Sekou Toure, the first President of Guinea, was a close associate of Kwame Nkrumah, the former president of Ghana. Red symbolizes the people's sacrifice, yellow represents the sun and the riches of the earth, and green the country's vegetation.

==Colors==

In keeping with other flags in the region, the Pan-African movement's colours of red, yellow, and green are used. As a former French colony it may be no coincidence that the design is a tricolour. The colours of the flag from left to right are the reverse of the flag of Mali.
