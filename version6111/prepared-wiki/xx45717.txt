==Elections==

For the Belgian local elections, 2012, Herstappe was the only Belgian municipality where elections were not held as there was only one candidate list. Previously, this had already happened between 1958 and 1994."Herstappe, seule commune belge qui ne votera pas lors des communales", La Libre Belgique, 17 September 2012Chris Snick, "De enige burgemeester die dit weekend goed zal slapen", De Standaard, 12 October 2012

==Mayors==

The incumbent mayor (since 1994), Serge Louwet, was the lowest paid Belgian mayor in 2012 with 675 € for his monthly wages. Actually, his official salary is 1,400 € but he considered it too high and kept only 675, the rest being given back to the municipal treasurer."De armste: Serge Louwet (Herstappe)", Het Nieuwsblad, 27 September 2012
