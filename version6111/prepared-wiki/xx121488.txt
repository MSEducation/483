Sir Thomas Davies Lloyd, 1st Baronet (May 21, 1820 – July 21, 1877), was a British Liberal Member of Parliament, for Cardiganshire (Ceredigion) 1865-1868 and Cardigan Boroughs 1868-1874. An old fashioned Whig Liberal, he defeated David Davies of Llandinam for Cardiganshire, 1865. Although he coveted a peerage and spent a fortune in pursuit of that aim, he had to be content with a baronetcy.
He was the son of Thomas Lloyd of Cilrhiwe and Bronwydd, Cardiganshire, who had been the High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1814.[tpl]cite web |url= http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-LLOY-DAV-1820.html| title= Welsh Biography Online| publisher= National Library of Wales|accessdate= 2011-04-08[/tpl] He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford.  In 1840, he joined the 13th Light Dragoons, and was a commander in Ottawa, Canada with the 82nd Foot.  He married Henrietta Mary, fourth daughter of George Reid, Esquire, of Jamaica.  Returning to Wales, he was High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1851, and in 1863 was created a baronet.
He rebuilt Bronwydd as a Victorian Gothic fantasy 1853-6. The house is now a ruin, in the process of clearance. He restored the old castle at Newport, Pembrokeshire as a seat for his 'Marcher Lordship' of Cemais and Llangynllo Church. His chivalric fantasies left the estate deeply in debt.
He was succeeded by his son, Sir Marteine Lloyd, 2nd Baronet.
