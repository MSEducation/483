OmniCircus is a gallery and performance art space located in the heart of San Francisco’s SoMa district and home to Garvey’s performance ensemble, (also called OmniCircus), as well a permanent installation of his films, paintings, sculptures, music, photos, and robots.  The OmniCircus shows integrate live acting, music, and dance with sophisticated mechanical actors and midi-controlled, computer animated (VIRpt) performers.
