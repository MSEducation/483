Pocklington [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|k|l|ɪ|ŋ|t|ən[/tpl] is a small market town and civil parish situated at the foot of the Yorkshire Wolds in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, approximately [tpl]Convert|13|mi|km[/tpl] east of York.
It is common in the area to refer to towns in a highly abbreviated form in casual conversation: thus, Pocklington is commonly referred to as "Pock".
Pocklington lies at the centre of the ecclesiastical Parish of Pocklington, which also encompasses the small hamlet of Kilnwick Percy as well as a scattering of outlying farms and houses.
Justice is covered by the magistrates' district of Wilton Beacon now sitting at Beverley Magistrates' Court following the closure of Pocklington Court in George Street.
The town's skyline is dominated by a 15th-century tower of All Saints church. The town’s architecture is a mixture of quaint old houses and modern buildings and the town has several unusual street names reflecting its history from the Iron Age onwards.
It is now considered to be a commuter town for York, Hull and Leeds.

==History==

Pocklington gets its name via the Old English "Poclintun" from the Anglian settlement of Pocel's (or Pocela's) people and the Old English word "tun" meaning farm or settlement,A.D. Mills, The Popular Dictionary of English Place-Names, Parragon, 1996 ISBN 0-7525-1851-8 (based on A Dictionary of English Place-Names, OUP, 1991). Retrieved 1 November 2006. but though the town's name can only be traced back to around 650 AD, the inhabitation of Pocklington as a site is thought to extend back a further 1,000 years or more to the Bronze Age.
In the Iron Age Pocklington was the regional capital of the Parisi tribe(Claudius Ptolemaeus), Geography, Book 2, Part 2 - "The Tribes and Cities of Mainland Britain" and by the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 it was the second largest settlement in Yorkshire, after York itself.
Pocklington developed through the Middle Ages while many similar places fell into dramatic decline. Pocklington owed much of its prosperity in the Middle Ages to the fact that it was a local centre for the trading of wool[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yorkshiretoday.net/pocklington.html|title=In Praise of Pocklington|work=Yorkshire Today|publisher=Business Link Magazine Group|accessdate=20 June 2009[/tpl] and lay on the main road to York, an important national centre for the export of wool to the continent. Wool was England’s principal export in the earlier Middle Ages.

==Governance==

Pocklington is twinned with:
The Pays de Racan twinning has brought about, amongst other activities, reciprocal rugby match trips.
Pocklington Town Council is responsible for the cemetery, allotments, the Croft play-park and the Arts Centre within Pocklington. It consists of thirteen elected councillors who meet regularly to administer the town's services.http://www.pocklington.gov.uk/towncouncil.htm pocklington.gov.uk
The town's motto is "Service with Freedom". Its shield is based on the arms of the Dolman family, founders of Pocklington School and was granted to the town council in 1980. The crown at the base of the shield is the emblem of the saints, along with the gold cross, symbolises the town's historic connection with Paulinus and the Archbishop of York. The wheat sheaves note Pocklington's agricultural importance and the water lily the famous lily lakes at Burnby Hall Gardens. 
The town council has a policy of naming all new streets using the surnames of the war dead of Pocklington and neighbouring Barmby Moor village - this gives rise to such names as Strother Close, Waite Close, Garrick Drive, Turnbull Close and Harper Close, which would seem unusual to the casual visitor. There is some slight controversy surrounding this move, with fears with earlier historic names are being erased.http://www.pocklingtontoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=996&ArticleID=1023392 pocklingtontoday.co.uk
In the last five years several action groups have been formed to address local issues:

==Geography==

Pocklington is situated at the foot of the Yorkshire Wolds, hills which form the eastern edge of the Vale of York, and stretch from Pocklington [tpl]Convert|40|mi|km[/tpl] or so in a north-easterly direction to the east coast around Bridlington.
Geologically speaking, the whole area was originally under water, and, when the land rose, the chalk Wolds were formed from the skeletons and shells covering the sea floor. The landscape around Pocklington therefore varies from flat arable land primarily devoted to agriculture to the south and west, and grassy, limestone hills and valleys to the north and east. A lot of this lower farming country was originally reclaimed from marshland, from the Middle Ages onwards.
Crops grown include traditional arable crops seen elsewhere in the country but also include rape seed, turf and sugar beet. The last is a familiar sight being hauled by tractor in large open-top trailers to York, where it is used by firms such as Nestle and British Sugar.

Pocklington is bisected by the largely invisible (it now runs underground for much of its length) Pocklington Beck, a small stream that feeds into the Pocklington Canal. The beck and canal are usually good fishing grounds but a sewerage overflow in 2003 killed thousands of fish and severely damaged the ecosystem, from which it is still recovering.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,970026,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Pollution kills fish in waterways | first=Martin | last=Wainwright | date=4 June 2003 | accessdate=22 May 2010[/tpl]
