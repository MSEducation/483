==History==

Nawa Station was opened on February 18, 1912 as [tpl]nihongo|Nawamura Station|名和村駅|Nawamura-eki[/tpl] on the Aichi Electric Railway Company. The Aichi Electric Railway became part of the Meitetsu group on August 1, 1935. The station was renamed to its present name on October 1, 1947. From 1978-1979, the tracks were elevated. In December 2004, the Tranpass system of magnetic fare cards with automatic turnstiles was implemented, and the station has been unattended since that point.
