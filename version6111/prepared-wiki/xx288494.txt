Richard J. "Dick" Casull (/kə'sul/) was a Utah-born gunsmith and wildcat cartridge developer whose experiments with .45 Colt ammunition in the 1950s led to the creation of the .454 Casull cartridge. Casull’s passion were six-shooters, and he was determined to create a high velocity round for the .45 Colt. His goal was to achieve a muzzle velocity of 2,000 feet per second with Colt .45 rounds fired from a single-action Army-style revolver with a 7 ½ inch barrel. This proved impossible due to the tensile strength of the Colt .45 case, so he set out to develop his own casing and bullet.
Casull began his career as a wildcat cartridge developer after having contact with Elmer Keith in the 1940s. An Idaho rancher, firearms enthusiast, and author.  Keith was instrumental in the development of the first magnum revolver cartridge, the .357 Magnum, as well as the later .44 Magnum and .41 Magnum cartridges. Keith was instrumental in the development of various wildcat cartridges, a few of which were later adopted as factory rounds.
Casull also worked with Oregon-based gunsmith P.O. Ackley, the famous wildcat cartridge developer. Ackley developed a family of improved wildcat cartridges by rechambering extant firearms and fireforming the ammunition to decrease body taper and increase shoulder angle, resulting in a higher case capacity. Ackley improved not only standard cartridges but was the creator of th first  a .17 caliber (4.5 mm) centerfire cartridge. He developed the .450 Ackley Magnum (based on .375 H&H Magnum necked up to .458) and the .475 Ackley Magnum (based on a .375 H&H Magnum necked up to .475 (12 mm)).

==Casull .454 Cartridge==

Though he developed many wildcat cartridges for pistols and rifles, Casull is most famous for creating the .454 Casull cartridge in 1957 with Jack Fullmer. was first announced in November 1959 by Guns & Ammo magazine. The basic design was a lengthened and structurally improved .45 Colt case. .45 Schofield and .45 Colt cartridges can fit into the .454's chambers, but not the other way around because of the lengthened case (very similar to the way .38 Special cartridges can fit into the longer chambers of a .357 Magnum and .44 Special cartridges can fit into the longer chambers of a .44 Magnum).[tpl]cite book |last=Barnes |first=Frank C. |authorlink= |coauthors=Skinner, Stan |title=Cartridges of the World 12th Edition: A Complete and Illustrated Reference for Over 1500 Cartridges |publisher=Krause Publications |date=October 20, 2009 |location= |page=568 |isbn=978-0-89689-936-0[/tpl]
The wildcat cartridge finally went mainstream in 1997, when Ruger began chambering its Super Redhawk in this caliber. Taurus followed with the Raging Bull model in 1998 and the Taurus Raging Judge Magnum in 2010.

===Specifications===

The Casull round uses a small rifle primer rather than a pistol primer, because it develops extremely high chamber pressures of over 60,000 CUP (copper units of pressure) (410 MPa), and has a significantly stronger cup than a pistol primer. The .454 Casull is one of the most powerful handgun cartridges in production. It can deliver a 250 grain (16 g) bullet with a muzzle velocity of over 1,900 feet per second (580 m/s), developing more than 2,000 ft-lb (2.7 kJ) of energy, although energy levels from common .454 revolvers with 7–8 inch barrels are typically somewhat lower (1,600–1,700 ft·lbf). The round is primarily intended for hunting medium game, metallic silhouette shooting and predator defense.
The cartridges were originally loaded with a triplex load of propellants, which gave progressive burning, aided by the rifle primer ignition, resulting in a progressive acceleration of the bullet as it passed up the barrel. The first commercially available revolver chambered in .454 Casull was made by Freedom Arms in 1983 as a five-shot revolver.

==Mini Revolvers==

Casull began developing a min-revolver design, which was licensed by the short-lived Rocky Mountain Arms Corp. (RMAC) of Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1971, RMAC began producing a mini-revolver chambered in .22 short. Casull's original design used  a lever attached to the hammer to lock the cylinder in place.  He later redesigned his mini-revolver to place the locking mechanism on the bottom of the frame, eliminating the lever attached to the hammer.  He was granted U.S. Patents 4228606 and 4228608 in 1980 for the mechanism for mounting the cylinder to the frame for the cylinder locking mechanism, respectively.[tpl]cite web|last=Buffaloe|first=Ed|title=Mini Revolvers|url=http://unblinkingeye.com/Guns/MiniR/minir.html|publisher=The Unblinking Eye|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl]

==Freedom Arms==

In 1978, Casull became a partner of Wayne Baker in the Freedom, Wyoming-based Freedom Arms firearms manufacturing business to produce a 5-shot mini revolver in .22 LR known as "The Patriot".  It was later offered in .22 Short and .22 WMR.[tpl]citation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ulWbH-4xtd8C&pg=PA21|title=Gun Digest Buyer's Guide to Concealed-Carry Handguns|author=Jerry Ahern|pages=21–22|isbn=1-4402-1383-6|publisher=Gun Digest Books|year=2010[/tpl] A 4-shot mini revolver was also produced by Freedom Arms.

The mini-revolver design was sold to North American Arms.

===Single-Action Revolvers===

Casull began building a number of 5-shot prototypes on Ruger Super Blackhawk frames. The FA Model 83 single-action revolver chambered in .454 Casull was introduced in 1983. ref>[tpl]citation|title=Flat-shooting trail gun: Casull 3800|author=John Taffin|date=February 2003|work=Guns Magazine|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_2_49/ai_95680070/pg_2/[/tpl][/ref] This model is still manufactured today as the Model 83.[tpl]cite book | last = Barnes| first = Frank C.| authorlink = | coauthors = Skinner, Stan| title =Cartridges of the World: 10th Edition, Revised and Expanded | publisher = Krause Publications| year = 2003| location = | pages = 528| isbn = 978-0-87349-605-6[/tpl]
A number of variants upon the Model 83 have been produced, all with five-shot cylinders. The first was a .45 Colt in February 1986, followed closely by a .44 Magnum version.[tpl]citation|work=American Handgunner|title=Freedom arms: 25 years of sixgun perfection|date= seriesSeptember-October 2008|author=John Taffin|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BTT/is_195_32/ai_n27963924/[/tpl] In 1991, Freedom Arms introduced the Model 252 in .22 long rifle and in 1992 the model 353 in .357 Magnum. In 1993 the Model 555 was introduced in .50 Action Express. .41 Magnum and .475 Linebaugh chamberings were introduced in 1997 and 1999 respectively.[tpl]citation|work=Guns Magazine|author=John Taffin|title=Freedom Arms Model 97 - The Sixgunner|date=May–June 2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BTT/is_169_28/ai_114475593/[/tpl] Freedom Arms introduced their own .500 Wyoming Express in the Model 83 .500 WE in 2005.[tpl]citation|title=Freedom Arms' biggest big bore: the 1/2"-bore fan gets a new cartridge and a stellar one it is|work=Guns Magazine|date=April 2006|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_4_52/ai_n26776096/[/tpl]
The Model 97 design, with a Model 83 frame of reduced size, was introduced in 1997, originally with a six-shot .357 Magnum cylinder (.38 Special cylinder available). A five-shot .45 Colt chambering was introduced the following year, as was a five-shot .41 Magnum in 2000. Six-shot .22's are produced with .22LR sporting and match grade cylinders available, as well as .22 Magnum, from 2003. A five-shot .44 Special chambering came in 2004.[tpl]citation|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_5_50/ai_114283923/|title=Freedom arms Model 97 .44 special|author=John Taffin|date=May 2004|work=Guns Magazine[/tpl]
The Model 2008, introduced in 2010, is a single-shot pistol with interchangeable barrels, most in rifle chamberings.[tpl]citation|title=Gun Digest 2012|author=Dan Shideler|isbn=1-4402-1447-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HEjWeu2XJlEC&pg=PA252|page=251[/tpl]
Other gun manufacturers have since began manufacturing single-action revolvers chambered in .454 Casull.

===Official Gun of Wyoming Proposal===

In 2013, Wyoming State Rep. Richard Cannady (R-Glenrock) introduced a bill to make Freedom Arms Model 83 single-action revolver chambered in .454 Casull as Wyoming’s official state gun.[tpl]cite web|title=Wyoming Lawmakers Push .454 Casull Revolver As Official State Firearm|url=http://fishgame.com/gunnews/?p=147|publisher=Texas Fish & Game|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl]
