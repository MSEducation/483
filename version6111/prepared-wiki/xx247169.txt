Inter county, or inter-county,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/gaa-news-and-videos/daily-news/1/1503121053-muldoon-announces-inter-county-retirement-/|title=Muldoon announces inter-county retirement|accessdate=2012-04-06[/tpl] is Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) terminology which refers to competitions or matches between GAA counties (which are somewhat different from legal counties). The term can also be used to describe the players on the teams.
The first inter county competitions the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship took place in 1887.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dundalkyoungirelands.com/club-information/93-1887-all-ireland-championship-|title=1887 All-Ireland Championship |accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl] Inter county teams select the best players from the clubs within the county, a practice which began in 1892.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.talkl8r.com/talkl8r~39~39.htm|title=Talk later|accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl] Before 1892 the winner of each counties club championship would represent the county in the All-Ireland championships.
The inter county season begins in January with each province's warm up competition and ends in September after the All Ireland final. The GAA's inter county competitions are the organisation's most attended competitions and are Ireland's most attended sporting events, while the All Ireland finals are the most watched.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.esri.ie/pdf/BKMNINT180_Main%20Text_Social%20and%20Economic%20Value%20of%20Sport.pdf|publisher=The Economic and Social Research Institute |title=The Social Significance of Sport|accessdate=2008-10-21[/tpl] and the All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event in Ireland's sporting calendar.http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_10004396.shtml
Usually each of the 32 GAA counties in Ireland participates in the inter county leagues and in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship; Kilkenny does not compete in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, and Cavan GAA does not currently compete in the National Hurling League although a non-county team, Fingal, does. London also competes in the Men's Hurling and Gaelic football championships and leagues, winning the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship once in 1901,

In Great Britain, the British provincial council organise inter county competitions for the 7 counties under its control.[tpl]cite web|url=http://britain.gaa.ie/strongprovfixturesresultsstrongbrluaiteachaistoradhcige.html|title=Prov Fixtures / Results |accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl] The British provincial council is the only area outside Ireland to organise regular inter county matches.
Changing clubs between counties is known as an inter county transfer and is regulated by the Provincial council if the clubs are in the same province, or by the central council of the GAA when the transferring between clubs in different provinces. A special transfer is available for students going on a J-1 visa, which allows a temporary transfer to Canada, New York or North America.
