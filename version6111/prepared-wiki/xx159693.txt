==Plot==

Trust revolves around a corporate law team led by partner Stephen Bradley, a maverick lawyer who often finds sense in apparently senseless argument. In each episode the team are presented with corporate clients who require the services of the law firm, often in the handling of critical deals including takeovers, mergers and acquisitions and dissolutions. The show also dealt with issues relating to long city working hours, corporate competition, drug abuse in the work place and corporate social responsibility (or the lack of it, as is often the case in this series).

==Locations==

Trust is set in the City of London and makes full use of the city's iconic buildings as visual references. Cooper Fozards offices are actually portrayed using two separate buildings for exterior shots, Thomas More Square in Wapping is portrayed as Cooper Fozard's office building while roof shots (which often provide breaks within episode stories to focus on series spanning themes) are filmed at 1 Poultry. This leads to a confusing affair where to a casual viewer a rectangular building appears to have a triangular roof!
Other locations have included The Bank of England and St Paul's Cathedral. The series makes constant use of aerial photograph of The City with Tower 42, The Gherkin (while still under construction), Shoreditch & Hoxton, Lloyds of London and The Royal Exchange frequently being utilised to set the scene.
The title sequence features shots of the City from Waterloo Bridge and the title banner is displayed over an ultrawide angle shot of the Aviva building and 122 Leadenhall Street (which is now undergoing demolition) in Undershaft.
