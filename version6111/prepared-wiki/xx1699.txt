Carbamazepine (CBZ) (Tegretol, Equetro) is an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug used primarily in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder, as well as trigeminal neuralgia. Off-label uses, include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, phantom limb syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, borderline personality disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Studies on the use of carbamazepine in pregnant women have demonstrated exposure of the fetus to the drug and its metabolites. Intrauterine exposure to carbamazepine has been shown to be teratogenic and is associated with the development of spina bifida,[tpl]cite journal |last=Jentink |first=J |coauthors=Dolk, H, Loane, MA, Morris, JK, Wellesley, D, Garne, E, de Jong-van den Berg, L, EUROCAT Antiepileptic Study Working, Group |title=Intrauterine exposure to carbamazepine and specific congenital malformations: systematic review and case-control study |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) |date=2010-12-02 |volume=341 |pages=c6581 |doi=10.1136/bmj.c6581 |pmid=21127116 |pmc=2996546[/tpl] neurodevelopmental problems,[tpl]cite journal |last=Cummings |first=C |author2=Stewart, M|author3=Stevenson, M|author4=Morrow, J|author5=Nelson, J |title=Neurodevelopment of children exposed in utero to lamotrigine, sodium valproate and carbamazepine |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |date=2011-03-17 |pmid=21415043 |volume=96 |issue=7 |pages=643–7 |doi=10.1136/adc.2009.176990[/tpl] craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, and developmental delays.
It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[tpl]cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Medical uses==

Carbamazepine is typically used for the treatment of seizure disorders and neuropathic pain.[tpl]cite web |title=Carbamazepine |url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/carbamazepine.html |work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists |accessdate=3 April 2011[/tpl] It may be used off-label as a second line treatment for bipolar disorder and as an adjunct, never alone, with an antipsychotic in some cases of schizophrenia when treatment with a conventional antipsychotic alone has failed.
In the United States, the FDA-approved indications are epilepsy (including partial seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and mixed seizures), trigeminal neuralgia, and manic and mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder. Although data are still lacking, carbamazepine appears to be as effective and safe as lithium for the treatment of bipolar disorder, both in the acute and maintenance phase.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ceron-Litvoc D, Soares BG, Geddes J, Litvoc J, de Lima MS |title=Comparison of carbamazepine and lithium in treatment of bipolar disorder: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials |journal=Hum Psychopharmacol |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=19–28 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19053079 |doi=10.1002/hup.990[/tpl]

==Adverse effects==

Common adverse effects may include drowsiness, dizziness, headaches and migraines, motor coordination impairment, nausea, vomiting and/or constipation. Alcohol use while taking carbamazepine may lead to enhanced depression of the central nervous system.
Less common side-effects may include cardiac arrhythmias, blurry or double vision and/or the temporary loss of blood cells or platelets and in rare cases can cause aplastic anemia or agranulocytosis. With normal use, small reductions in white cell count and serum sodium levels are common; however, in rare cases, the loss of platelets may become life-threatening. In this case a doctor may recommend frequent blood tests during the first few months of use, followed by three to four tests per year for established patients. Additionally, carbamazepine may possibly exacerbate preexisting cases of hypothyroidism, so yearly thyroid function tests are advisable for persons taking the drug.
There are also rare reports of an auditory side-effect for carbamazepine use, whereby patients perceive sounds about a semitone lower than previously.[tpl]cite journal |author=Yoshikawa H, Abe T |title=Carbamazepine-induced abnormal pitch perception |journal=Brain Dev. |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=127–9 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12581810 |doi= 10.1016/S0387-7604(02)00155-9 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0387760402001559[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Konno S, Yamazaki E, Kudoh M, Abe T, Tohgi H |title=Half pitch lower sound perception caused by carbamazepine |journal=Intern.

Oxcarbazepine, a derivative of carbamazepine, reportedly has fewer and less serious side-effects.
Carbamazepine may cause syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), since it both increases the release and potentiates the action of ADH (vasopressin).
Carbamazepine may aggravate juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, so it is important to uncover any history of jerking, especially in the morning, before starting the drug. It may also aggravate other types of generalized seizure disorder, particularly absence seizures.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1124/jpet.106.10496 |title=The Mechanism of Carbamazepine Aggravation of Absence Seizures |year=2006 |author=Lige Liu, Thomas Zheng, Margaret J.

In addition, carbamazepine has been linked to serious adverse cognitive anomalies, including EEG slowing[tpl]cite journal |author=Salinsky MC, Binder LM, Oken BS, Storzbach D, Aron CR, Dodrill CB |title=Effects of gabapentin and carbamazepine on the EEG and cognition in healthy volunteers |journal=Epilepsia |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=482–90 |year=2002 |pmid=12027908 |doi=10.1046/j.1528-1157.2002.22501.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1528-1157.2002.22501.x?cookieSet=1 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKvX3m5E |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no[/tpl] and apoptosis of cultured cerebellar neurons.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gao XM, Margolis RL, Leeds P, Hough C, Post RM, Chuang DM |title=Carbamazepine induction of apoptosis in cultured cerebellar neurons: effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate, aurintricarboxylic acid and cycloheximide |journal=Brain Res. |volume=703 |issue=1–2 |pages=63–71 |year=1995 |pmid=8719616 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(95)01066-1[/tpl]
The FDA informed health care professionals that dangerous or even fatal skin reactions (Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), that can be caused by carbamazepine therapy, are significantly more common in patients with a particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele, HLA-B*1502. This allele occurs almost exclusively in patients with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, including South Asian Indians.[tpl]cite web |author=MedWatch |title=Carbamazepine |url=http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2007/safety07.htm#carbamazepine |date=2007-12-12 |work=2007 Safety Alerts for Drugs, Biologics, Medical Devices, and Dietary Supplements |publisher=FDA |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKvY37EY |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no[/tpl] In Europeans a large proportion of sensitivity is associated with HLA-B58. Researchers have also identified another genetic variant, HLA-A*3101 which has been shown to be a strong predictor of both mild and severe adverse reactions to carbamazepine among Japanese[tpl]cite journal |author=Ozeki T, Mushiroda T, Yowang A, Takahashi A, Kubo M, Shirakata Y, Ikezawa Z, Iijima M, Shiohara T, Hashimoto K, Kamatani N, Nakamura Y. |title=Genome-wide association study identifies HLA-A*3101 allele as a genetic risk factor for carbamazepine-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions in Japanese population |journal=Hum Mol Genet |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=1034–1041 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21149285 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddq537[/tpl] and Europeans.http://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/WhatWeDo/News/Reactiontodruglinkedtogeneticvariant, Epilepsy Society: genome-wide association study of Europeans  with adverse reaction to carbamazepine.

===Associated birth defects===

If taken during pregnancy, Carbamazepine can cause birth defects that include:  cardiovascular and urinary tract anomalies, craniofacial defects such as cleft palate,[tpl]cite journal|last=Matalon|first=S|coauthors=Schechtman, S; Goldzweig, G; Ornoy, A|title=The teratogenic effect of carbamazepine: a meta-analysis of 1255 exposures.|journal=Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)|date=Jan–Feb 2002|volume=16|issue=1|pages=9–17|pmid=11934528|doi=10.1016/S0890-6238(01)00199-X[/tpl] fingernail hypoplasia, microcephaly, developmental delays, and intrauterine growth restrictions.[tpl]cite book|last=Skelley|first=Tao Le, Vikas Bhushan, Nathan William|title=First aid for the USMLE step 2 CK|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-176137-6|pages=357|edition=8th ed.[/tpl]

===Interactions===

Carbamazepine has a potential for drug interactions; caution should be used in combining other medicines with it, including other antiepileptics and mood stabilizers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/lexicomp/carbamazepine.html |title=Carbamazepine |date=February 2009 |author=Lexi-Comp |work=The Merck Manual Professional |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKvOP99i |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no[/tpl] Retrieved on May 3, 2009. Lower levels of carbamazepine are seen when administrated with phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin), or primidone (Mysoline), which can result in breakthrough seizure activity. Carbamazepine, as a CYP450 inducer, may increase clearance of many drugs, decreasing their concentration in the blood to subtherapeutic levels and reducing their desired effects.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic77.htm |title=eMedicine - Toxicity, Carbamazepine |work= |accessdate= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ZpbVBsOJ |archivedate=2008-08-04 |deadurl=no[/tpl] Drugs that are more rapidly metabolized with carbamazepine include warfarin (Coumadin), lamotrigine (Lamictal), phenytoin (Dilantin), theophylline, and valproic acid (Depakote, Depakote ER, Depakene, Depacon). Drugs that decrease the metabolism of carbamazepine or otherwise increase its levels include erythromycin,[tpl]cite journal |author=Stafstrom CE, Nohria V, Loganbill H, Nahouraii R, Boustany RM, DeLong GR |title=Erythromycin-induced carbamazepine toxicity: a continuing problem |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=149 |issue=1 |pages=99–101 |date=January 1995 |pmid=7827672 |doi= 10.1001/archpedi.1995.02170130101025 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7827672 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKvQB98w |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no[/tpl] cimetidine (Tagamet), propoxyphene (Darvon), and calcium channel blockers. Carbamazepine also increases the metabolism of the hormones in birth control pills and can reduce their effectiveness, potentially leading to unexpected pregnancies. As a drug that induces cytochrome P450 enzymes, it accelerates elimination of many benzodiazepines and decreases their action.[tpl]cite book |author=Moody D |editor=Raymon LP, Mozayani A (eds.) |title=Handbook of Drug Interactions: a Clinical and Forensic Guide |publisher=Humana |year=2004 |pages=3–88 |chapter=Drug interactions with benzodiazepines |isbn=1-58829-211-8[/tpl]
Valproic acid and valnoctamide both inhibit microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide into inactive metabolites.[tpl]cite book |last=Gonzalez |first=Frank J. |coauthors=Robert H. Tukey |editor=Laurence Brunton, John Lazo, Keith Parker (eds.) |title=Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-142280-2 |page=79 |chapter=Drug Metabolism[/tpl] By inhibiting mEH, valproic acid and valnoctamide cause a buildup of the active metabolite, prolonging the effects of carbamazepine and delaying its excretion.
Grapefruit juice raises the bioavailability of carbamazepine by inhibiting CYP3A4 enzymes in the gut wall and in the liver.

===Environmental impact===

Carbamazepine can enter the environment through discharge of wastewater, and has also been shown to persist and accumulate in the organic components of soil and sludge.[tpl]cite journal |author=Stamatelatou K, Frouda C, Fountoulakis MS, Drillia P, Kornaros M, Lyberatos G |title=Pharmaceuticals and health care products in wastewater effluents: the example of carbamazepine |journal=Water Science Technology Water Supply |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=131–137 |date=January 2003 |doi= |url=http://www.iwaponline.com/ws/00304/0131/003040131.pdf |deadurl=no[/tpl] As carbamazepine is an emerging contaminant,i.e. one that is relatively new, and still unregulated in terms of its discharge to the environment the effects of its bioaccumulation on other living creatures and plants are not well-understood.

==Pharmacokinetics==

Carbamazepine is relatively slowly but well absorbed after oral administration. Its plasma half life is about 30 hours when it is given as single dose, but it is a strong inducer of hepatic enzymes and the plasma half-life shortens to about 15 hours when it is given repeatedly. Some of its metabolites have antiepileptic properties. A slow-release preparation is used for patients who experience transient side effects coinciding with plasma concentration peaks following oral dosing.

==Mechanism of action==

The mechanism of action of carbamazepine and its derivatives is relatively well-understood. Carbamazepine stabilizes the inactivated state of Voltage-gated sodium channels, making fewer of these channels available to subsequently open. This leaves the affected cells less excitable until the drug dissociates.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] Carbamazepine has also been shown to potentiate GABA receptors made up of alpha1, beta2, gamma2 subunits.Granger, P. et al. Modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor by the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and phenytoin. Mol. Pharmacol. 47, 1189–1196 (1995). This mechanism may contribute to its efficacy in neuropathic pain and manic-depressive illness.

==History==

Carbamazepine was discovered by chemist Walter Schindler at J.R. Geigy AG (now part of Novartis) in Basel, Switzerland, in 1953.[tpl]cite journal |author=Schindler W, Häfliger F |title=Über Derivate des Iminodibenzyls |journal=Helvetica Chimica Acta |year=1954 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=472–83. |doi=10.1002/hlca.19540370211[/tpl] Schindler then synthesized the drug in 1960, before its anti-epileptic properties had been discovered.
Carbamazepine was first marketed as a drug to treat trigeminal neuralgia (formerly known as tic douloureux) in 1962. It has been used as an anticonvulsant and antiepileptic in the UK since 1965, and has been approved in the US since 1974.
In 1971, Drs. Takezaki and Hanaoka first used carbamazepine to control mania in patients refractory to antipsychotics (lithium was not available in Japan at that time). Dr. Okuma, working independently, did the same thing with success. As they were also epileptologists, they had some familiarity with the anti-aggression effects of this drug. Carbamazepine would be studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s.[tpl]cite journal |author=Okuma T, Kishimoto A |title=A history of investigation on the mood stabilizing effect of carbamazepine in Japan |journal=Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=3–12 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9682927 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.1998.tb00966.x[/tpl]
