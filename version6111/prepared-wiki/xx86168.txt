Luna Sea (stylized as LUNA SEA) is a Japanese rock band formed in Kanagawa Prefecture in 1986. Due to the use of make-up and costumes early in their career and their widespread popularity, they are considered one of the most successful and influential bands in the visual kei movement. Throughout the mid-1990s they used significantly less make-up, and after a one-year break in 1998, came back with a more mainstream alternative rock style and toned down their on-stage attire. When they disbanded in 2000, they left a big mark on the Japanese rock scene. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked Luna Sea at number 90 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts.[tpl]cite web|title=Top 100 Japanese pops Artists - No.90|work=hmv.co.jp|url=http://www.hmv.co.jp/news/newsDetail.asp?newsnum=308150081|accessdate=2011-09-06|language=Japanese[/tpl]
Founded in 1986, by bassist J and rhythm guitarist Inoran while in high school, the band was originally called Lunacy. In 1989 they recruited lead guitarist Sugizo, drummer Shinya and vocalist Ryuichi, a lineup that has remained the same. They released a few demo tapes prior to renaming themselves Luna Sea in 1991 and releasing their self-titled debut album. The band achieved their breakthrough success with a sold-out tour in 1991, which helped them get a contract with MCA Victor, and with the release of their second album Image (1992), which reached number nine on the Oricon music chart. Following the critically acclaimed albums Eden (1993), Mother (1994) and Style (1996), the band switched to Universal in 1998 and released their best-selling studio album, Shine. In late 2000, after their seventh studio album Lunacy, Luna Sea disbanded. In 2007, Luna Sea reunited for a one-off reunion concert at the Tokyo Dome, and again in 2008 for the hide memorial summit. In 2010 the group officially reunited and held a world tour, and three years later they released their first new album in thirteen years, A Will.

==History==

===1986–1991: Formation and debut album===

High school friends Jun "J" Onose and Kiyonobu "Inoran" Inoue founded a band called Lunacy in 1986.[tpl]cite web|title=LUNA SEA: God Bless You|url=http://jrockrevolution.com/2007/08/webzine/luna-sea-god-bless-you-26|work=JRock Revolution|date=2007-08-27|accessdate=2013-03-01[/tpl] They recruited Yasuhiro "Sugizo" Sugihara and Shinya Yamada from the band Pinoccio three years later on January 16, 1989. As J was already the bass player and Inoran preferred to play rhythm guitar, Sugizo switched from bass guitar to lead guitarist. Vocalist Ryuichi Kawamura (then called "Rayla") from the band Slaughter joined on May 6, finalizing the group's lineup. Lunacy debuted on stage at the 100-seat capacity Play House in Machida, Tokyo on May 29, 1989.

==Musical style and influence==

Luna Sea formed at the end of the 1980s, when American and British glam rock/metal were gradually losing popularity to alternative rock and grunge at the beginning of the 1990s. However, Japan's original rock groups were late following the Western trend, and as such Luna Sea formed when bands of the  visual kei movement, Japan's answer to glam, were finally being recognized and achieving mainstream success. In the early 1990s, while still an indie band, the group's musical style was punk rock with gothic rock and even some hardcore punk tendencies.[tpl]cite web |title=X Japan's Sugizo Wants to Save the Whales |url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2010/10/following_up_on_our_interview.php?page=2 |date=2010-10-12 |work=SF Weekly |accessdate=2012-06-03[/tpl] According to Alexey Eremenko of Allmusic, Luna Sea's sound is "firmly based in '80s hard rock, with a versatile progressive approach to songwriting, and its softer side, displayed later on in the group's career, proved equally strong."[tpl]cite web|last=Eremenko |first=Alexey |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist |id=p511789 |pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Luna Sea |date=2008-10-02 |work=AllMusic |accessdate=2011-10-31[/tpl] The members' individual music backgrounds also influenced the band's style; as children, Sugizo and Shinya mastered the violin and the traditional taiko drums respectively. They also preferred different genres of music, as Ryuichi and Shinya had a tendency for pop, while Inoran, J and Sugizo loved heavier rock. Sugizo liked England's indie music culture, while J prefers the American rock scene.[tpl]cite web| title=Sugizo on Luna Sea| url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/articles-68169-sugizo-on-luna-sea.html| work=jame-world.com| publisher=Japanese Music Entertainment| accessdate=2012-11-21[/tpl] As for native Japanese bands, Dead End had particular influence on the group in the beginning, with Ryuichi being vocally and visually inspired by their frontman Morrie.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000005292| title=DEAD END、当時の貴重なライヴ映像付のベスト盤リリース| date=2005-02-02| work=barks.jp| accessdate=2011-09-26| language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://jrockrevolution.com/2010/12/webzine/interview-luna-sea-in-hollywood-ca-300| title=Interview: Luna Sea in Hollywood, CA| author=Ali W.| work=JRock Revolution| accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl] Luna Sea and X Japan, despite their different musical styles, had a close professional and personal relationship since the early 1990s.
Luna Sea's musical catalog encompasses songs in a diverse range of musical styles, including punk and post-punk (e.g. "Precious...", "Déjàvu", "Jesus"), gothic rock (e.g. "Moon", "Lastly"), hard rock (e.g. "Storm", "Hurt"), alternative rock (e.g. "True Blue", "Gravity"), progressive rock (e.g. "Genesis of Mind ~Yume no Kanata e~", "1999") and ballads (e.g. "Breathe", "Love Song"). Some of the band's songs also feature the violin, played by Sugizo (e.g. "Providence", "Mother"). They also wrote longer tracks, such as the nine and ten-minute long ballads "Forever & Ever" and "Virgin Mary", and the twenty-three minute "The One -Crash to Create-". The majority of the band's lyrics are in Japanese, but usually all songs include some English words or lines. While all lyrics and songwriting has been credited to Luna Sea as a whole since 1993, over the years the member who originally composed specific songs have been revealed by the band or otherwise learned. Lyrics are almost exclusively written by Ryuichi,[tpl]cite web| title=Interview LUNA SEA: Shinya talks about the band’s evolution. “We didn’t plan it, but this album captures what LUNA SEA is about right now”| url=http://www.en.barks.jp/news/?id=1000003852| date=2013-12-21| work=barks.jp| accessdate = 2013-12-21[/tpl] whose music contributions are limited to "Until the Day I Die" and "Lost World". The majority of songs are originally composed by J, Inoran or Sugizo, with Shinya's only compositions being "Inside You", "Echo", and "Millennium", the last written with Sugizo. When asked if there was a message in their songs, Sugizo stated that there is no reason for Luna Sea to give a political message, only to create music that will stimulate the imagination and act as "a catalyst for realistic feedback."[tpl]cite web| title=InterviewLUNA SEA's SUGIZO speaks about 'A WILL' which 'contains the love and gratitude that was fully realized precisely because we have had a 25 year long history'| url=http://www.en.barks.jp/news/?id=1000003764&page=2| date=2013-12-11| work=barks.jp| accessdate=2013-12-14[/tpl] When writing material, all the band members live together temporarily before they enter the studio to record.
Many newer bands and artists, most being visual kei acts, have been influenced by Luna Sea. Musicians that cite them as influences or look up to them include Miyavi,[tpl]Cite web| title=Exclusive interview with miyavi| url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/articles-1054-exclusive-interview-with-miyavi.html| work=jame-world.com| date=2006-09-17| accessdate=2013-02-28[/tpl] members of Alice Nine,[tpl]cite web| title = Interview Alice Nine 'Alice Nine Plays a Songs In A Variety Of Different Genres.
