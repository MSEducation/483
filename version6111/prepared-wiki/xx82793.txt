It is often used as an immunohistochemical marker for motor neurons (motoneurons).

==Mutations==

Mutants of ChAT have been isolated in several species, including C. elegans, Drosophila, and humans. Most non-lethal mutants that have a non-wild type phonetype exhibit some activity, but significantly less than wild type.
In C. elegans, several mutations in ChAT have been traced to the cha-1 gene. All mutations result in a significant drop in ChAT activity. Percent activity loss can be greater than 98% in some cases. Phenotypic effects include slowed growth, decreased size, uncoordinated behavior, and lack of sensitivity toward cholinesterase inhibitors.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rand|first=JB|coauthors=Russell, RL|title=Choline acetyltransferase-deficient mutants of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans|journal=Genetics|date=February 1984|volume=106|issue=2|pages=227–48|pmid=6698395[/tpl] Isolated temperature-sensitive mutants in Drosophila have all been lethal. Prior to death, affected flies show a change in behavior, including uncontrolled movements and a change in electroretinogram activity.[tpl]cite journal|last=Greenspan|first=Ralph J.|title=Mutations of choline acetyltransferase and associated neural defects|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology ? A|year=1980|volume=137|issue=1|pages=83–92|doi=10.1007/BF00656920[/tpl]
The human gene responsible for encoding ChAT is CHAT. Mutations in CHAT have been linked to congenital myasthenic syndrome, a disease which leads to general motor function deficiency and weakness. Further symptoms include fatal apnea. Out of ten isolated mutants, 1 has been shown to lack activity completely, 8 have been shown to have significantly decreased activity, and 1 has an unknown function.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ohno|first=K.|coauthors=Tsujino, A.; Brengman, J.

==ChAT and Diseases==

===Alzheimer's Disease===

The Alzheimer's disease(AD) involves difficulty in memory and cognition. The concentrations of acetylcholine and ChAT are remarkably reduced in the cerebral neocortex and hippocampus.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lippa|first=AS.|title=The cholinergic hypothesis of geriatric memory dysfunction|journal=Science|date=30 July 1982|volume=217|issue=4558|page=408|pmid=7046051[/tpl] Although the cellular loss and dysfunction of the cholinergic neurones is considered a contributor to Alzheimer disease, it is generally not considered as a primary factor in the development of this disease. It is proposed that the aggregation and deposition of the Beta amyloid protein, interferes the metabolism of neurones and further damages the cholinergic axons in the cortex and cholinergic neurones in the basal forebrain.[tpl]cite journal|last=Geula|first=C|title=Relationship between plaques, tangles, and loss of cortical cholinergic fibers in Alzheimer disease|journal=J Neuropathol Exp Neurol|date=January 1998|volume=57|issue=1|page=63|pmid=9600198[/tpl]

===Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis===

The amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) is one of the most common motor neuron diseases. A significant loss of ChAT immunoreactivity is found in ALS.[tpl]cite journal|last=Oda|first=J|title=Immunohistochemical study on choline acetyltransferase in the spinal cord of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|journal=Pathol Int|date=December 1995|volume=45|issue=12|page=933|pmid=8808298[/tpl] It is hypothesized that the cholinergic function is involved in a uncontrolled increase of intracellular calcium concentration whose reason still remains unclear.[tpl]cite journal|last=Morrison|first=BM|title=Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis associated with mutations in superoxide dismutase: a putative mechanism of degeneration|journal=Brain Res Brain Res Rev|date=January 1999|volume=29|issue=1|page=121|pmid=9974153[/tpl]

===Drugs===

Neostigmine methylsulfate, an anticholinesterase agent, has been used to target ChAT. In particular, use of neostigmine methylsulfate has been shown to have positive effects against congenital myasthenic syndrome.[tpl]cite journal|last=Greer|first=M|coauthors=Schotland, M|title=Myasthenia gravis in the newborn|journal=Pediatrics|date=July 1960|volume=26|pages=101–8|pmid=13851666[/tpl]
Exposure to estradiol has been shown to increase ChAT in female rats.[tpl]cite journal|last=Luine|first=VN|title=Estradiol increases choline acetyltransferase activity in specific basal forebrain nuclei and projection areas of female rats|journal=Experimental neurology|date=August 1985|volume=89|issue=2|pages=484–90|pmid=2990988[/tpl]
