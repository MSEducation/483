Rhode Island ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Rhode Island.ogg|ˌ|r|oʊ|d|_|ˈ|aɪ|l|ɨ|n|d[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|r|ɵ|ˈ|d|aɪ|l|ɨ|n|d[/tpl]), officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/RiConstitution/ConstFull.html|title = Constitution of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|accessdate =September 9, 2007 |publisher = State of Rhode Island General Assembly[/tpl] is a state in the New England region of the United States. Rhode Island is the smallest in area, the eighth least populous, but the second most densely populated of the 50 US states behind New Jersey. Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west and Massachusetts to the north and east, and it shares a water boundary with New York's Long Island to the southwest.  It also has the longest official name of all the states.
Rhode Island was the first of the original Thirteen Colonies to declare independence from British rule, declaring itself independent on May 4, 1776, two months before any other colony. The State was also the last of the thirteen original colonies to ratify the United States Constitution.Jensen, Founding, 679; Friedenwald, Interpretation, 92–93.

Rhode Island's official nickname is "The Ocean State", a reference to the State's geography, since Rhode Island has several large bays and inlets that amount to about 14% of its total area. Its land area is [tpl]convert|1045|sqmi|sqkm[/tpl], but its total area is significantly larger.

==Origin of the name==

Despite its name, most of Rhode Island is located on the mainland of the United States. The official name of the State, State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, derives from the merger of two settlements. Rhode Island colony was founded near present-day Newport, on what is now commonly called Aquidneck Island, the largest of several islands in Narragansett Bay. Providence Plantations was the name of the colony founded by Roger Williams in the area now known as the City of Providence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/map.htm |title=Rhode Island Geography Maps |publisher=Dlt.ri.gov |date= |accessdate=January 26, 2013[/tpl]
It is unclear how Aquidneck Island came to be known as Rhode Island, although there are two popular theories.
Giovanni da Verrazzano named a place on Rhode Island Puntum Iovianum in honor of his friend Paolo Giovio (Jovium in Latin) (1483 - 1542) humanist and historian. Giovio owned the Codex Cellere of Giovanni da Verrazzano containing the text of his first trip. 
The earliest documented use of the name "Rhode Island" for Aquidneck was in 1637, by Roger Williams.  The name was officially applied to the island in 1644 with these words: "Aquethneck shall be henceforth called the Isle of Rodes or Rhode-Island."  The name "Isle of Rodes" is found used in a legal document as late as 1646.Office of the Secretary of State: A. Ralph Mollis: State Library. Sos.ri.gov. Retrieved on 2014-04-12.Hamilton B. Staples, "Origins of the Names of the State of the Union", Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society, vol. 68 (1882): Google Docs, Origins of the Names of the State of the Union Dutch maps as late as 1659 call the island "Red Island" (Roodt Eylant).
Roger Williams was a theologian forced out of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Seeking religious and political tolerance, he and others founded "Providence Plantations" as a free proprietary colony.  "Providence" referred to the divine providence and "plantations" referred to an English term for a colony.
"State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations" is the longest official name of any state in the Union. On June 25, 2009, the General Assembly voted to allow the people to decide whether to keep the name or drop "and Providence Plantations" due to the misperception that the name related to slavery.[tpl]cite web|author=  |url=http://triad.news14.com/content/top_stories/611218/ri-closer-to-changing-state-name-over-slavery/ |title=RI closer to changing state name over slavery |publisher=Triad.news14.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26[/tpl] The referendum election was held on this subject during the November 2, 2010 elections, and the people overwhelmingly (78% to 22%) voted to keep the original name.[tpl]cite news |first=Gina |last=Macris |title=Strong 'no' to changing R.I. name |url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/REFERENDUM_QUESTIONS__11-03-10_L6KN60T_v37.28337dc.html |work=The Providence Journal |date=November 3, 2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2010 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]

==Geography==

Rhode Island covers an area of [tpl]convert|1214|sqmi|sqkm[/tpl] and is bordered on the north and east by Massachusetts, on the west by Connecticut, and on the south by Rhode Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean.Office of the Secretary of State: A. Ralph Mollis: State Library. Sos.ri.gov. Retrieved on July 12, 2013. It shares a narrow maritime border with New York State between Block Island and Long Island. The mean elevation of the state is 200 feet (60 m).
Nicknamed the Ocean State, Rhode Island has a number of oceanfront beaches. It is mostly flat with no real mountains, and the state's highest natural point is Jerimoth Hill, 812 feet (247 m) above sea level.[tpl]cite web| date =April 29, 2005 | url =http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest| title =Elevations and Distances in the United States| publisher =U.S Geological Survey| accessdate =November 7, 2006[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Located within the New England province of the Appalachian Region, Rhode Island has two distinct natural regions. Eastern Rhode Island contains the lowlands of the Narragansett Bay, while Western Rhode Island forms part of the New England Upland. Rhode Island's forests are part of the Northeastern coastal forests ecoregion.[tpl]cite journal |author = Olson, D. M, E.

Narragansett Bay is a major feature of the state's topography. Block Island lies about 12 miles (19 km) off the southern coast of the mainland. Within the Bay, there are over 30 islands. The largest is Aquidneck Island, shared by the municipalities of Newport, Middletown, and Portsmouth. The second-largest island is Conanicut; the third-largest is Prudence.

===Geology===

A rare type of rock called Cumberlandite, found only in Rhode Island (specifically in the town of Cumberland), is the state rock. There were initially two known deposits of the mineral, but since it is an ore of iron, one of the deposits was extensively mined for its ferrous content. The state is underlain by the Avalon terrane and was once part of the micro-continent Avalonia prior to closure of the Iapetus ocean.

==History==

===Colonial era: 1636–1770===

thumb|Roger Williams and Narragansett Native AmericansIn 1636, Roger Williams, after being banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his religious views, settled at the tip of Narragansett Bay, on land granted to him by the Narragansett and Pequot tribes. Both tribes were subservient to the Wampanoag tribe led by Massasoit. He called the site Providence "having a sense of God's merciful providence unto me in my distress."An Album of Rhode Island History by Patrick T. Conley  Eventually it became a place of religious freedom.
In 1638, after conferring with Williams, Anne Hutchinson, William Coddington, John Clarke, Philip Sherman, and other religious dissidents settled on Aquidneck Island (then known as Rhode Island), which was purchased from the local natives, who called it Pocasset. This settlement was called Portsmouth and was governed by the Portsmouth Compact. The southern part of the island became the separate settlement of Newport after disagreements among the founders.
Samuel Gorton purchased the Native American lands at Shawomet in 1642, precipitating a military dispute with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1644, Providence, Portsmouth, and Newport united for their common independence as the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, governed by an elected council and "president". Gorton received a separate charter for his settlement in 1648, which he named Warwick after his patron.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lonang.com/exlibris/organic/1663-cri.htm |title=Charter of Rhode Island (1663) |publisher=Lonang.com |accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl]
During King Philip's War (1675–1676), a force of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Plymouth militia under General Josiah Winslow invaded and destroyed the fortified Narragansett Indian village in the Great Swamp in what is now South Kingstown, Rhode Island, on December 19, 1675.King Philip's War[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] The Indians referred to this as a massacre. The Wampanoag tribe under war-leader Metacomet, whom the colonists called "King Philip", invaded and burned down several of the towns in the area, including Providence which was attacked twice.  In one of the final actions of the war, Benjamin Church killed King Philip in what is now Bristol, Rhode Island; King Philip's head was put on a pole and stood at the entrance to Plimoth Plantation as a warning to other Indians for years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/horsemusket/kingphilip/default.aspx |title=King Philip's War |publisher=Military History Online |date=July 17, 2004 |accessdate=January 26, 2013[/tpl]
The colony was amalgamated into the Dominion of New England in 1686, as King James II attempted to enforce royal authority over the autonomous colonies in British North America. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the colony regained its independence under the Royal Charter. Slaves were introduced at this time, although there is no record of any law legalizing slave-holding, although the colony later prospered under the slave trade, by distilling rum to sell in Africa as part of a profitable triangular trade in slaves and sugar with the Caribbean.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/extra/2006/slavery/day1/ |title=The Unrighteous Traffick |work=The Providence Journal |date=March 12, 2006 |accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]

===Revolutionary to Civil War Period: 1770-1860===

Rhode Island's tradition of independence and dissent gave it a prominent role in the American Revolution. At approximately 2 a.m. on June 10, 1772, a band of Providence residents attacked, and subsequently burned to the waterline, the grounded revenue schooner Gaspee for enforcing unpopular trade regulations within Narragansett Bay.[tpl]cite web|last=gaspee.org|title=Gaspee Affair Archive|url=http://www.gaspee.org/|publisher=Gaspee Virtual Archives|accessdate=August 20, 2012[/tpl] Rhode Island was the first of the thirteen colonies to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown, on May 4, 1776.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sos.ri.gov/library/history/independence/ |title=Know Rhode Island, RI Secretary of State |publisher=Sos.ri.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26[/tpl] It was also the last colony of the thirteen colonies to ratify the United States Constitution on May 29, 1790, once assurances were made that a Bill of Rights would become part of the Constitution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/rat_ri.html |title=Rhode Island Ratification of the U.S. Constitution |publisher=Usconstitution.net |date=January 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2013[/tpl] During the Revolution, the British occupied Newport. A combined Franco-American force fought to drive them off Aquidneck Island. Portsmouth was the site of the first African-American military unit, the 1st Rhode Island Regiment, to fight for the U.S. in the Battle of Rhode Island of August 29, 1778. The arrival of a French fleet forced the British to scuttle their own ships, rather than surrender them to the French. The celebrated march to Yorktown, Virginia in 1781 that ended with the defeat of the British at the Siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake began in Newport, Rhode Island under the joint command of General George Washington who led American troops and the Comte de Rochambeau who led French soldiers sent by King Louis XVI.  In 2009, this was officially recognized by the National Park Service.
Rhode Island was heavily involved in the slave trade during the post-revolution era. In 1774, the slave population of Rhode Island was 6.3%, nearly twice as high as any other New England colony. In the years after the Revolution, Rhode Island merchants controlled between 60% and 90% of the American trade of African slaves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slavenorth.com/rhodeisland.htm |title=Slavery in Rhode Island|publisher= Slavery in the North |date= |accessdate=January 26, 2013[/tpl]Slavery, the Brown Family of Providence, and Brown University, Brown News Bureau[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl]
In addition to the slave trade, Rhode Island was also heavily involved in the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution began in America in 1787 when Thomas Somers reproduced textile machine plans he imported from England. He helped to produce the Beverly Cotton Manufactory, which Moses Brown of Providence took an interest in. Teaming up with Samuel Slater, Moses Brown helped to create the second cotton mill in America, a water-powered textile mill. As the Industrial Revolution moved large numbers of workers into the cities, a permanently landless, and therefore voteless, class developed. By 1829, 60% of the state's free white males were ineligible to vote. After several unsuccessful attempts to address this problem, a new state constitution was passed in 1843 allowing landless white men to vote if they could pay a $1 poll tax.
In the early 19th Century, Rhode Island was subject to a tuberculosis outbreak which led to public hysteria about vampirism.

===Civil War to Progressive Era: 1860–1929===

During the American Civil War, Rhode Island was the first Union state to send troops in response to President Lincoln's request for help from the states. Rhode Island furnished 25,236 fighting men, of whom 1,685 died. On the home front, Rhode Island, along with the other northern states, used its industrial capacity to supply the Union Army with the materials it needed to win the war. The United States Naval Academy moved to Rhode Island temporarily during the war.
In 1866, Rhode Island abolished racial segregation in the public schools throughout the state.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl][/ref]
During World War I, Rhode Island furnished 28,817 soldiers, of whom 612 died. After the war, the state was hit hard by the Spanish Influenza.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/studteaguide/RhodeIslandHistory/chapt7.html |title=Rhode Island History: CHAPTER VII: Boom, Bust, and War, 1900–1945 |accessdate=March 28, 2006[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]
In the 1920s and 1930s, rural Rhode Island saw a surge in Ku Klux Klan membership, largely in reaction to large waves of immigrants moving to the state. The Klan is believed to be responsible for burning the Watchman Industrial School in Scituate, which was a school for African-American children.Robert Smith, In the 1920s the Klan Ruled the Countryside[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl], The Rhode Island Century, The Providence Journal, April 26, 1999.

===Growth in the modern era: 1929–present===

Since the Great Depression, the Rhode Island Democratic Party has dominated local politics. Rhode Island has comprehensive health insurance for low-income children, and a large social safety net. Many urban areas still have a high rate of children in poverty. Due to an influx of residents from Boston, increasing housing costs have resulted in more homeless in Rhode Island.[tpl]cite web | url = http://204.17.79.244/profiles/cw_pro.html | title = Providence Neighborhood Profiles[/tpl]
The 350th Anniversary of the founding of Rhode Island was celebrated with a free concert held on the tarmac of the Quonset State Airport on August 31, 1986. Performers included Chuck Berry, Tommy James and headliner Bob Hope.
In 2003, a nightclub fire in West Warwick claimed one hundred lives and resulted in nearly twice as many injured, and caught national attention. The fire resulted in criminal sentences.[tpl]cite news | last= Butler | first= Brian | title = Nightclub Fire Kills 39 People |date=February 21, 2003 | publisher= CNN | url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0302/21/bn.09.html[/tpl]
In March 2010, areas of the state received record flooding due to rising rivers from heavy rain. The first period of rainy weather in mid-March caused localized flooding, and two weeks later, more rain caused more widespread flooding in many towns, especially south of Providence. Rain totals on March 29–30, 2010 exceeded 14 inches in many locales, resulting in the inundation of area rivers—especially the Pawtuxet River which runs through central Rhode Island. The overflow of the Pawtuxet River, nearly [tpl]convert|11|ft|m[/tpl] above flood stage, submerged a sewage plant and closed a five-mile (8 km) stretch of Interstate 95. In addition, it flooded two shopping malls, numerous businesses, and many homes in the towns of Warwick, West Warwick, Cranston, and Westerly. Amtrak service between New York and Boston was also suspended during this period. Following the flood, Rhode Island was in a state of emergency for two days. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was called in to help flood victims.

==Politics==

The capital of Rhode Island is Providence. The state's current governor is Lincoln Chafee (D), and the lieutenant governor is Elizabeth H. Roberts (D). Its United States Senators are Jack Reed (D) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D). Rhode Island's two United States Representatives are David Cicilline (D-1) and Jim Langevin (D-2). See congressional districts map.
Rhode Island is one of a few states that do not have an official Governor's residence. See List of Rhode Island Governors.
The state legislature is the Rhode Island General Assembly, consisting of the 75-member House of Representatives and the 38-member Senate. Both houses of the bicameral body are currently dominated by the Democratic Party; the presence of the Republican Party is almost non-existent in the state government, with Republicans holding only a handful of seats in both the Senate and House of Representatives.
Because Rhode Island's population barely crosses the threshold for additional votes in both the federal House of Representatives and Electoral College, it is well represented relative to its population, with the eighth-highest number of electoral votes and second-highest number of House Representatives per resident. Based on its area, Rhode Island even has the highest density of electoral votes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.270towin.com/states/New_Jersey |title=New Jersey Presidential Election Voting History |publisher=270towin.com |date= |accessdate=January 26, 2013[/tpl]
Federally, Rhode Island is a reliably Democratic state during presidential elections, regularly giving the Democratic nominees one of their best showings. The state was devoted to Republicans until 1908, but has only strayed from the Democrats 7 times in the 24 elections that have followed. The last sixteen presidential elections in Rhode Island have resulted in the Democratic Party winning the Ocean State's Electoral College votes twelve times (The only Republican victories during that time being in 1952, 1956, 1972 and 1984). In the 1980 presidential election, Rhode Island was one of only six states to vote against Republican Ronald Reagan. Reagan did carry Rhode Island in his 49-state victory in 1984, but the state was Reagan's second-weakest victory (After neighboring Massachusetts). No Republican since Reagan has even won any of the state's counties in a Presidential election; in fact, in 1988, it was the only state where George H.W Bush lost every county (Although Bush still was able to win over 40% of the state's popular vote, something no Republican since has done). Rhode Island was the Democrats' leading state in 1988 and 2000, and second-best in 1968, 1996 and 2004. Rhode Island's most one-sided Presidential election result was in 1964, with over 80% of Rhode Island's votes going for Lyndon B. Johnson. In 2004, Rhode Island gave John Kerry more than a 20-percentage-point margin of victory (the third-highest of any state), with 59.4% of its vote. All but three of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns voted for the Democratic candidate. The only exceptions were East Greenwich, West Greenwich and Scituate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cstewart/www/nationwide2004.xls|title=nationwide2004|author=Stewart, Charles|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=August 28, 2007[/tpl] taken from web.mit.edu In 2008, Rhode Island gave Barack Obama a 28-percentage-point margin of victory (the third-highest of any state), with 63% of its vote.

Rhode Island has abolished capital punishment, making it one of 15 states that have done so. Rhode Island abolished the death penalty very early, just after Michigan, the first state to abolish it, and carried out its last execution in the 1840s.

Rhode Island has a higher percentage of Americans of Portuguese ancestry, including Portuguese Americans and Cape Verdean Americans than any other state in the nation. Additionally, the state also has the highest percentage of Liberian immigrants, with more than 15,000 residing in the state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://runningafrica.com/news-03212009DED-Extension.html|title=Obama grants 12-month extension to Liberians on DED |accessdate=January 4, 2009 |publisher=The Providence Journal c/o The African Media Network[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Italian Americans make up a plurality in central and southern Providence County and French Canadians form a large part of northern Providence County.

Yankees of English ancestry still have a presence in the state as well, especially in Washington County, and are often referred to as "Swamp Yankees." African immigrants, including Cape Verdean Americans, Liberian Americans, Nigerian Americans and Ghanaian Americans, form significant and growing communities in Rhode Island.
Although Rhode Island has the smallest land area of all fifty states, it has the second highest population density of any state in the Union, second only to that of New Jersey.

===Religion===

A Pew survey of Rhode Island residents' religious self-identification showed the following distribution of affiliations: Protestant 27%, Mormonism 0.5%, Jewish 1%, Roman Catholic 43%, Orthodox 1%, Non-religious 23%, Jehovah's Witness 1%,  Hinduism 0.5%, Buddhism 1% and Islam 0.5%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/maps |title=U.S. Religion Map and Religious Populations - U.S. Religious Landscape Study - Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life |publisher=Religions.pewforum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26[/tpl] The largest denominations are the Roman Catholic Church with 456,598 adherents, the Episcopal Church (United States) with 19,377, and the American Baptist Churches USA with 15,220 adherents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/44/rcms2010_44_state_adh_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives | State Membership Report |publisher=www.thearda.com |accessdate=December 5, 2013[/tpl]
Rhode Island has one of the highest percentage of Roman Catholics[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_romcath.html | publisher = Adherents.com | title = The Largest Roman Catholic Communities | accessdate =February 13, 2009 | year = 2000[/tpl] in the nation mainly due to large Irish, Italian, and French Canadian immigration in the past; recently, significant Portuguese and various Hispanic communities have also been established in the state. Though it has one of the highest overall Catholic percentages of any state, none of Rhode Island's individual counties ranks among the 10 most Catholic in the United States, as Catholics are very evenly spread throughout the state.
The Jewish community of Rhode Island is centered in the Providence area, and emerged during a wave of Jewish immigration, (predominately from the Shtetl between 1880 and 1920. The presence of the Touro Synagogue in Newport, the oldest existing synagogue in the United States, emphasizes that these second-wave immigrants did not create Rhode Island's first Jewish community; a comparatively smaller wave of Portuguese Jews immigrated to Newport during the colonial era.

===Cities and towns===

Rhode Island is divided into five counties, but along with Connecticut and to a partial extent the rest of New England, it has no county government. The entire state is divided into municipalities, which handle all local government affairs.
There are 39 cities and towns in Rhode Island. Major population centers today result from historical factors—with the advent of the water-powered mill development took place predominantly along the Blackstone, Seekonk, and Providence Rivers. Providence is the base of a large metropolitan area.
Ranked by population, the state's 15 largest municipalities are:
In common with many other New England states, some of Rhode Island's cities and towns are further partitioned into villages. Notable villages include Kingston, in the town of South Kingstown, which houses the University of Rhode Island, Wickford, in the town of North Kingstown, the site of an annual international art festival, and the Town Hall of the Town of South Kingstown is located in the Village of Wakefield.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southkingstownri.com/ |title=Homepage of the Town of South Kingstown |accessdate=April 5, 2013[/tpl]

==Economy==

The Rhode Island economy had a colonial base in fishing.
The Blackstone River Valley was a major contributor to the American Industrial Revolution. It was in Pawtucket that Samuel Slater set up Slater Mill in 1793,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slatermill.org|publisher=Slater Mill Historic Site|title=Slater Mill|accessdate=April 13, 2008[/tpl] using the waterpower of the Blackstone River to power his cotton mill. For a while, Rhode Island was one of the leaders in textiles. However, with the Great Depression, most textile factories relocated to southern US states. The textile industry still constitutes a part of the Rhode Island economy, but does not have the same power that it once had.
Other important industries in Rhode Island's past included toolmaking, costume jewelry and silverware. An interesting by-product of Rhode Island's industrial history is the number of abandoned factories—many of them now being used for condominiums, museums, offices, and low-income and elderly housing. Today, much of the economy of Rhode Island is based in services, particularly healthcare and education, and still to some extent, manufacturing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Providence-Economy.html|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|title=Providence: Economy – Major Industries and Commercial Activity|accessdate=April 13, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.bls.gov/eag/eag.ri.htm|title=Rhode Island Economy at a Glance|publisher=US Dept. of Labor|accessdate=April 13, 2008[/tpl]

==Transportation==

===Bus===

The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) operates statewide intra- and intercity bus transport from its hubs at Kennedy Plaza in Providence, Pawtucket, and Newport. RIPTA bus routes serve 38 of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns (New Shoreham on Block Island being the only exception). RIPTA currently operates 58 routes, including daytime trolley service (using trolley-style replica buses) in Providence and Newport.

===Ferry===

From 2000 through 2008, RIPTA offered seasonal ferry service linking Providence and Newport (already connected by highway) funded by grant money from the United States Department of Transportation. Though the service was popular with residents and tourists, RIPTA was unable to continue on after the federal funding ended. Service was discontinued as of 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbn.com/RIPTA-No-Newport-ferry-service-in-2010,48712 |title=RIPTA: No Newport ferry service in 2010 |publisher=Pbn.com |date=December 7, 2012 |accessdate=January 26, 2013[/tpl] The privately run Block Island Ferry[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blockislandferry.com/ |title=Block Island Ferry |publisher=Block Island Ferry |date= |accessdate=January 26, 2013[/tpl] links Block Island with Newport and Narragansett with traditional and fast-ferry service, while the Prudence Island Ferry[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prudenceferry.com/ |title=Prudence Island Ferry |publisher=Prudenceferry.com |date=October 15, 2012 |accessdate=January 26, 2013[/tpl] connects Bristol with Prudence Island.

===Rail===

The MBTA Commuter Rail's Providence/Stoughton Line links Providence and T.F. Green Airport with Boston. The line was later extended southward to Wickford Junction, with service beginning April 23, 2012. The state hopes to extend the MBTA line to Kingston and Westerly. as well as explore the possibility of extending Connecticut's Shore Line East to T.F. Green Airport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dot.state.ri.us/intermod/index.asp |title=State of Rhode Island: Department of Transportation: Intermodal Planning |publisher=Dot.state.ri.us |date=October 27, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2013[/tpl] Amtrak's Acela Express stops at Providence Station (the only Acela stop in Rhode Island), linking Providence to other cities in the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak's Northeast Regional service makes stops at Providence Station, Kingston, and Westerly.

===Aviation===

Rhode Island's primary airport for passenger and cargo transport is T. F. Green Airport in Warwick, though Rhode Islanders who wish to travel internationally on direct flights or who seek a greater availability of flights and destinations often fly through Logan International Airport in Boston.

===Limited access highways===

Interstate 95 runs southwest to northeast across the state, linking Rhode Island with other states along the East Coast. Interstate 295 functions as a partial beltway encircling Providence to the west. Interstate 195 provides a limited-access highway connection from Providence (and Connecticut and New York via I-95) to Cape Cod. Initially built as the easternmost link in the (now cancelled) extension of Interstate 84 from Hartford, Connecticut, a portion of U.S. Route 6 through northern Rhode Island is limited-access and links I-295 with downtown Providence.
Several Rhode Island highways extend the state's limited-access highway network. RI-4 is a major north-south freeway linking Providence and Warwick (via I-95) with suburban and beach communities along Narragansett Bay. RI-10 is an urban connector linking downtown Providence with Cranston and Johnston.  RI-37 is an important east-west freeway through Cranston and Warwick and links I-95 with I-295. RI-99 links Woonsocket with Providence (via RI-146). RI-146 travels through the Blackstone Valley, linking Providence and I-95 with Worcester, Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Turnpike. RI-403 links RI-4 with Quonset Point.
Several bridges cross Narragansett Bay connecting Aquidneck Island and Conanicut Island to the mainland, most notably the Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge and the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge.

===Bicycle paths===

The East Bay Bike Path stretches from Providence to Bristol along the eastern shore of Narragansett Bay, while the Blackstone River Bikeway will eventually link Providence and Worcester.
In 2011, Rhode Island completed work on a marked on-road bicycle path through Pawtucket and Providence, connecting the East Bay Bike Path with the Blackstone River Bikeway, completing a [tpl]convert|33.5|mi|km[/tpl] bicycle route through the eastern side of the state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/Bike_Paths_07-12-11_N2P4G48_v19.3537d.html |title=Providence Journal | Rhode Island news, sports, weather & more |publisher=Projo.com |date= |accessdate=January 26, 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] The William C.

==Culture==

Some Rhode Islanders speak with a distinctive, non-rhotic, native Rhode Island accent that many compare to a cross between the New York City and Boston accents (e.g. "water" sounds like "wata"). Many Rhode Islanders distinguish a strong aw sound [tpl]IPA|ɔə[/tpl] (i.e. do not exhibit the cot–caught merger), as one might hear in New Jersey or New York City; for example, the word coffee is pronounced [tpl]IPA|ˈkʰɔəfi[/tpl] [tpl]respell|KAW|fee[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.quahog.org/factsfolklore/index.php?id=43|title=Guide to Rhode Island Language Stuff|accessdate=May 30, 2007|publisher=Quahog.org[/tpl] This type of accent was brought to the region by early settlers from eastern England in the Puritan migration to New England in the mid-seventeenth century.David Hackett Fischer, Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America (Oxford University Press, 1989), pg. 13-207 (ISBN 0195069056)

===Food and beverages===

Several foods and dishes are unique to Rhode Island and some are hard to find outside of the state. Hot wieners, which are sometimes called gaggers, weinies, or New York System wieners, are smaller than a standard hot dog, served covered in a meat sauce, chopped onions, mustard, and celery salt. Famous to Rhode Island is Snail Salad, which is served at numerous restaurants throughout the state.  The dish is normally prepared "family style" with over five pounds of snails mixed in with other ingredients commonly found in seafood dishes.[tpl]cite web|author=Lisa Ghenne |url=http://thecuttingedgeofordinary.blogspot.com/2008/06/scungilli-snail-salad.html |title=Scungilli Snail Salad  |publisher=Cutting Edge of Ordinary|date=June 13, 2008 |accessdate=January 26, 2013[/tpl] Grinders are submarine sandwiches, with a popular version being the Italian grinder, which is made with cold cuts (usually ham, prosciutto, capicola, salami, and Provolone cheese). Linguiça or chouriço (a spicy Portuguese sausage) and peppers, eaten with hearty bread, is also popular among the state's large Portuguese community.
Pizza strips are prepared in Italian bakeries and sold in most supermarkets and convenience stores. They are rectangular strips of pizza without cheese. Their rich flavor comes solely from a dense, zesty tomato paste baked on a half inch tall pan pizza crust, and may be enjoyed warm or cold. Party pizza is a box of these pizza strips. Spinach pies are similar to a calzone but filled with seasoned spinach instead of meat, sauce and cheese.  Variations can include black olives or pepperoni with the spinach.
As in colonial times, johnnycakes are made with corn meal and water, then pan-fried much like pancakes. During fairs and carnivals, Rhode Islanders enjoy dough boys, plate-sized disks of fried dough sprinkled with powdered sugar (or pizza sauce).  Zeppoles are Italian doughnut-like pastries traditionally eaten on Saint Joseph's Day, often made with exposed centers of vanilla pudding, cream filling, or ricotta cream, and sometimes topped with a cherry.
As in many coastal states, seafood is readily available.  Shellfish is extremely popular, with clams being used in multiple ways.  The quahog, from the Narragansett Indian word "poquauhock"; see A Key into the Language of America by Roger Williams 1643) is a large clam usually used in a chowder. It is also ground and mixed with stuffing (and sometimes spicy minced sausage) and then baked in its shell to form a stuffie.  Steamed clams are also a very popular dish.  Calamari (squid) is sliced into rings and fried and is served as an appetizer in most Italian restaurants, typically Sicilian-style, i.e. tossed with sliced banana peppers and with marinara sauce on the side.
Rhode Island, like the rest of New England, has a tradition of clam chowder.  While both the white New England variety and the red Manhattan variety are popular, there is also a unique clear chowder, known as Rhode Island Clam Chowder available in many restaurants.  According to Good Eats, the addition of tomatoes in place of milk was initially the work of Portuguese immigrants in Rhode Island, as tomato-based stews were already a traditional part of Portuguese cuisine, and milk was costlier than tomatoes.  Scornful New Englanders called this modified version "Manhattan-style" clam chowder because, in their view, calling someone a New Yorker was an insult.
A culinary tradition in Rhode Island is the clam cake.  The clam cake (also known as a clam fritter outside of Rhode Island) is a deep fried ball of buttery dough with chopped bits of clam inside.  They are sold by the half-dozen or dozen in most seafood restaurants around the state.  The quintessential summer meal in Rhode Island is chowder and clam cakes.

This unique syrup was invented in the state and is sold in almost all Rhode Island supermarkets, as well as border states.  Although coffee milk contains some caffeine, it is sold in school cafeterias throughout the state.  Strawberry milk is also as popular as chocolate milk.thumb|An example of a "low" three digit license plate

===Famous Rhode Islanders===

===Low numbered license plates===

Since 1904, when the first black and white porcelain license plates were issued by the state, politicians have distributed low-numbered plates as a way to reward supporters or associates; such plates have become a status symbol. State officials have seemingly legitimized this by making Rhode Island one of the few states which allows the owner to leave license plates to other family members in their will. For "preferred plates", (Passenger plates with 1 letter and 1-3 digits or 2 letters with 1-2 digits, Passenger plates with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 digits, Commercial/Motorcycle plates with 1-4 digits, Combination plates with 1-4 digits, Suburban/War Veteran's plates with 1-3 digits, and National Guard plates with 1-2 digits), there has also been an official license plate lottery through the Governor's Office.  The value depends on the category of the license plate, the general "Ocean State" is the most valuable followed by "Combination" or "Suburban" license plates; license plates under the category "Taxi", "Commercial", "State", "Public" or "Bus" are less important because the total number of these plates are fewer.  The main branch of the Division of Motor Vehicles is cooperative in allowing choosing the two letters beginning the license plates if available in the plate room, as long as not a preferred plate.

===Popular culture===

The Farrelly brothers and Seth MacFarlane depict Rhode Island in popular culture, often making comedic parodies of the state.  MacFarlane's television series Family Guy is based in a fictional Rhode Island city named Quahog, and notable local events and celebrities are regularly lampooned. Peter is seen working at the Pawtucket brewery, and other state locations are mentioned.
The movie High Society, starring Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra, was set in Newport, Rhode Island.
The film adaptation of The Great Gatsby from 1974 was also filmed in Newport.
Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis and John F. Kennedy were married at St. Mary's church in Newport, RI.  Their reception was held at Hammersmith Farm, the Bouvier summer home in Newport.
