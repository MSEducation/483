Republic of the Rio Grande Capitol Building MuseumRepublic of the Rio Grande Museum Home Page is located in the downtown San Agustin Historical District in Laredo, Texas, USA, next to the historic La Posada Hotel, previously the site of the former Laredo High School. Once the Republic of the Rio Grande capitol building, it now showcases memorabilia from the short-lived Republic of the Rio Grande and displays pictures, books, and furniture from the 19th century Laredo area. There are three restored rooms: an office and sitting area, a bedroom, and a kitchen. The museum offers guided tours for school age children and adults year-round.  Because of this Republic, Laredo had flown seven flags instead of the traditional Six flags over Texas.
The museum is operated by the Webb County Heritage Foundation, a non-profit 501 (c) (3) organization chartered in 1980 to promote historic preservation, education, and tourism.
