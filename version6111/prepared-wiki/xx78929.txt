==Fund distribution==

In non-profit corporations' fund usage, it is the recommended practice for a 65%/35% ratio to exist comparing "programs" to G&A and fundraising. Golden Key's ratio for 2008 was 84/16, in 2009 88/12, in 2010 85/12 and in 2011 86/14; thus the Society is currently utilizing its funds in a way that is well above and beyond the "recommended practice." [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=48 |title=Charity Navigator Financial Ratings Tables[/tpl]  Golden Key publishes its annual reports every year in August and makes them available online. 
Questions were raised over the amount of money spent on Golden Key's scholarships.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] Articles in the University of British Columbia student newspaper, The Ubyssey, examined the society's finances and scholarship practices. It was noted in The Ubyssey that in 1997 salaries, management and general expenses totaled almost 47 percent of the total expenditures. The society is continually increasing their scholarship offerings and currently awards over $1,000,000 annually in scholarships and awards. All financials since 2008 have been made publicly available on their website and are audited by third party auditors.
Each local chapter receives funding from Golden Key headquarters and may use this money as they see fit to run various events and community service projects. A variable amount (minimum $100) of additional funds are allocated for in-house chapter cash scholarships. The amount given for these local scholarships is based on the number of members inducted, which is then distributed by the local chapter in accordance with their determined criteria. Some criteria may include active participation in chapter service projects and meeting attendance. Most chapters divide their available chapter scholarships into three awards: one each for Sophomore, Junior and Senior students.
