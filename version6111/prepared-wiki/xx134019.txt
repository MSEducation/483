[[Scouting Ireland Provinces]]

CATEGORIES: Scouting Ireland

A Scout Province is an administrative division within Scouting Ireland. Each province comprises a number of Scout Counties, which are mobilised and coordinated to combine their resources for the improvement of Scouting at a local level.
There are six Scout Provinces in Ireland: Dublin, Northern, North Eastern, Western, Southern and South Eastern. They are based on a geographical area of reasonable distance and the National Management Committee determines their boundaries.
The Scout Province is organised and administered by the Provincial Management/Support Team (PMST).  The primary role of the Scout Province is to support scouting at local level by assisting and supporting Scout Counties in fulfilling their role and by assisting in the making of Scouting Irelandâ€™s policies and ensuring that these policies are carried out.
Wood Badge Training is carried out within Provinces by Provincial Training Co-ordinators and their teams, administrated by Provincial Support Officers, professional staff working in offices within each province.
