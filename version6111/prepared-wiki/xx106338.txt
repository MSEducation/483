Lynne Russell (born November 1, 1946 in Orange, New Jersey) is an American journalist and author. She was the first woman to solo anchor a prime time network nightly newscast, as the popular host of CNN Headline News from 1983 to 2001. While her resume’ includes local television and radio markets from Miami to Honolulu, she is best known for her work on CNN and on CNN Headline News.

==Early life and education==

Russell, an only child, studied classical Russian ballet and piano from the age of seven. Her mother was of Italian descent, one of seven children of Neapolitan immigrants who had a small grocery store in New Jersey; her father, one of nine children born on a family farm in Leeds, North Dakota, was of Irish and German background. Russell grew up in the military, as an "Army brat". Her father was a career U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer, and the family moved frequently. Consequently, she attended thirteen schools before graduating from Manzano High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She had planned on a career in the Foreign Service, fascinated by the travel and freedom her mother’s only unmarried sibling, Maria, enjoyed in the diplomatic service, so Russell began picking up languages in high school. But her mother prevailed upon her to be more practical and pursue a line of work in which she could “always find a job”, and she enrolled in the School of Nursing at the University of Colorado in Boulder and Denver.

==Career==

Discovering nursing did not suit her emotionally,[tpl]clarify|date=February 2014[/tpl] Russell was in need of work and took her first job out of college at a music radio station, KCOL (AM) in Fort Collins, Colorado, where she spent four years[tpl]when|date=February 2014[/tpl] learning journalism from the ground up. This was followed by seven years in Miami at WKAT-AM, whose format was talk, news and information. She co-hosted the 6–10 am program, “The Informer”, and served as Program Director. Russell also contributed to Miami public television station WPBT (PBS); she acted in - and voiced - television and radio commercials and industrial films, and was a member of the Screen Actors Guild. She then worked at Infinity Broadcasting Corporation’s Jacksonville, Florida radio station, WIVY. At that time[tpl]when|date=February 2014[/tpl] she was approached to begin her television news career, as Jacksonville NBC affiliate WTLV news director Howard Kelley asked her to anchor their evening Action News with Peter Burns. This happened the day after Russell’s boss had put his fist through the control room door at the radio station, because she had broken format and neglected to play a Bee Gees song. Russell grabbed the TV job.
WTLV gave way to Honolulu, Hawaii NBC affiliate KHON-TV, where she anchored, worked the military beat and reported on health stories. In addition, her days began at 4am, telephoning Oahu’s neighbor islands looking for news to report in the NBC Today Show local slots. After a sleepless year, she moved back to the mainland as investigative and courts reporter and evening eyewitness news anchor with Fred Lozano at CBS affiliate KENS in San Antonio, Texas.

==CNN and CNN Headline News==

In January 1983, media mogul Ted Turner's staff contacted Russell at KENS in San Antonio and asked her to move to Atlanta, Georgia, where the Cable News Network had just established itself as the first 24-hour television news outlet. Its new sister network, known then as CNN2, would televise 48, half-hour newscasts every day. Russell said yes. She stayed until May, 2001. She became the first woman to solo anchor a prime time network nightly newscast,[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] as the popular host of CNN Headline News from 1983 to 2001.
Russell is credited[tpl]by whom|date=February 2014[/tpl] with playing a major role in the development and history of the CNN networks. In an effort to boost network visibility, she hosted special programming for airline travelers. From 1983 to 1989 she co-anchored the CNN Week In Review program, with Bob Cain. She introduced America’s educators to the original concept of cable in the classroom, which teachers embraced in the form of CNN Week In Review programs and study guides.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]  She was honored with the inaugural “Russell P. Jandoli Excellence in Journalism Award” from St. Bonaventure University.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
In 1989, at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, she combined her connections to the military and to her colleagues by pinning the coveted Air Assault badge on CNN’s first Special Assignments Correspondent, friend, and then-current fiancė, Chuck de Caro, upon his graduation from the US Army Air Assault School.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Russell resigned from the networks to help care for her ailing spouse, who later recovered, but from whom she is now divorced.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] Her final newscast on CNN Headline News came on May 18, 2001.  Fellow anchor Chuck Roberts, who had delivered the inaugural newscast on that network, produced a short retrospective of Russell’s time at CNN. It aired that night: Lynne Russell - last newscast on Headline News. The same channel, now known as HLN, is not a part of the original network.

==After CNN==

In 2005, Russell accompanied her then-husband, who had recovered from his illness, to Toronto, Canada, where she focused on writing, but kept her hand in the media. From 2006 to 2008, she was an anchor on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television network CBC Newsworld. From 2008 to 2010, she hosted a radio program on Toronto station Newstalk 1010. She also acquired an Ontario real estate license and traded in real estate with a brokerage there.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
