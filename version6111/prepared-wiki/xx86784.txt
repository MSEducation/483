==Districts==

Downtown Honolulu can be subdivided into four neighborhoods, each with its own central focus and mix of buildings.  These areas are the Capitol District, the Central Business District, Chinatown, and the Waterfront.

===Capitol District===

The Capitol District, or Civic Center, contains most of the federal, state, and city governmental buildings and is centered on the Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i State Capitol, [tpl]okina[/tpl]Iolani Palace, and Honolulu Hale (city hall).  It is roughly bounded by Richards Street on the west, Ward Avenue on the east, Vineyard Boulevard to the north, and Nimitz Highway to the south.  Significant buildings in this area include:

===Central Business District===

Centered on Bishop Street and Fort Street Mall, the central business district is roughly bounded by Nu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uanu Avenue, Nimitz Highway, Richards Street, and Vineyard Boulevard.  This area contains most of the headquarters buildings of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i-based companies and most of the skyscrapers.  Buildings in this area include:

===Chinatown===

Located between Nu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uanu Stream and Nu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uanu Avenue, Chinatown at one time was the center of Chinese cultural contact on the island.  Central to this area is the open-air O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu Market.  The area around Nu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uanu Avenue has become an Arts District, thanks to the renovation of the Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Theatre.  Buildings in this area include:

===Waterfront===

Honolulu's waterfront area centers on Aloha Tower, which was once the tallest building in Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i and where cruise ships would dock before the advent of air travel between Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i and the U.S. Mainland.  Recently, cruise ships between the Hawaiian Islands now dock at Honolulu Harbor.  Buildings in this area include:
