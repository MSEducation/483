On 10 November 1971, a Merpati Nusantara Airlines Vickers Viscount, registration PK-MVS, crashed in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Padang, Sumatra, Indonesia, after telling air traffic controllers they could not make their destination due to bad weather. All 69 people aboard the aircraft were killed in the crash. 
At the time, the accident was the worst in the history of Indonesia; it is today the ninth worst aviation accident in Indonesian history. It remains the third worst Vickers Viscount accident.

==Accident==

The aircraft was flying between Kemayoran Airport in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Tabing Airport, the former airport of Padang, Indonesia. Five minutes before it was scheduled to arrive at Padang, air traffic controllers lost radio contact with the flight. Controllers at Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II Airport, Palembang, Sumatra, reported the aircraft issued a distress signal from the aircraft. The flight crew reportedly said they could not land at Padang because of poor weather and bad visibility.[tpl]cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Airliner Lost With 69 Aboard|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=uIxLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5SMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5687,2131796&hl=en|accessdate=1 January 2011|newspaper=The Press-Courier|date=11 November 1971[/tpl] The aircraft subsequently crashed into the Indian Ocean,[tpl]cite news|title=Turbo-prop feared lost, 69 on board |url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=4EQ_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=BlIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3692,3271823&hl=en|accessdate=1 January 2011|newspaper=The Windsor Star|date=11 November 1971[/tpl] killing all 62 passengers and seven crew aboard the aircraft.[tpl]cite web|title=Accident description|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19711110-0|publisher=Aviation Safety Network|accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl]
