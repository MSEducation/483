===Marine Special Operations Command===

The Marine Special Operations Command is the Marine Corps's special operations component that reports to United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  Currently, MARSOC trains, organizes, equips and, when directed by the Commander, USSOCOM, deploys task organized, scalable, and responsive U.S. Marine Corps special operations forces worldwide in support of combatant commanders and other agencies.
The MSOAG, formerly the FMTU, has been operating since 2005, before MARSOC formally existed.  MARSOC was formally activated during a February 24 ceremony at Camp Lejeune, N.C., where MARSOC is now headquartered. Fox Company, 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion, was the first of the Marine Special Operations Battalions' companies to activate in the Spring of 2006. Drawing its manpower from the core of 2nd Force Reconnaissance Co., Fox Company's creation came at the expense of 2nd Force Reconnaissance Co., which stood down upon the transfer of its platoons to both MARSOC's 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion, and a new company (Delta) of 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion.
The three Marine Special Operations Battalions (MSOBs) are:

===Marine Corps (Special Operations Capable) forces===

The Special Operation Capable forces are the units of the Marine Corps that are fully equipped, and prepared for any hostile, or emergency worldwide.  Being very co-dependent of the air-ground task force, they are capable of conducting special operations in conventional warfare, and often overlapping in unconventional methods, comparable to other special operations forces of maritime regions.  Many special mission tasks are mostly infantry support units, such as reconnaissance, ANGLICO, and others.
