A shrew's fiddle or neck violin is a variation of the yoke, pillory or rigid irons whereby the wrists are locked in front of the bound person by a hinged board or steel bar. It was originally used in the 18th century as a way of punishing women who were caught bickering or fighting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vienna.cc/english/folterm03.htm|title=Museum of Medieval legal history - Halsgeige (neck-viola) and Shame-mask - Medieval torture|accessdate=2008-05-04[/tpl]

==History==

The shrew's fiddle was used in medieval Germany and Austria, where it was known as a Halsgeige, meaning "neck viola" or "neck violin".[tpl]cite book | last = Rublack | first = Ulinka | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Crimes of Women in Early Modern Germany | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1999 | location = | pages = 75 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=FF6y3poQ4AYC&pg=PA75&dq=neck+violin+punish&lr=&client=firefox-a&sig=ax5eKhHA6YWpCcLk3gbnFxFMMLY#PPA75,M1 | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-19-820637-2 [/tpl] It was originally made out of two pieces of wood fitted with a hinge and a lock at the front. The shrew's fiddle consisted of three holes. One was a large hole for the neck and the other two were smaller holes which fastened the wrists in front of the face. A bell was sometimes attached to this portable pillory, to alert townspeople that the victim was approaching so that she might be mocked and otherwise humiliated. Another version was a "double fiddle" by which two people could be attached together face-to-face, forcing them to talk to each other. They were not released until the argument had been resolved.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/adventures/karlsruhe/rothenburg/|title=Rothenburg|accessdate=2008-05-04[/tpl]
