CATEGORIES: Human rights in Islam

Human rights in Islamic countries vary greatly. In some parts of the Muslim world, there is little respect for human rights, whilst other countries treat the issue with more importance.

==Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam==

Some countries with majority Muslim populations have tried to introduce the concept of Islamic human rights. The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam (CDHRI), adopted by the member states of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1990, provides an overview on the Islamic perspective on human rights, and affirms Islamic law (Shari'ah) as its sole source. CDHRI declares its purpose to be "general guidance for Member States the OIC in the Field of human rights". This declaration is usually seen as an Islamic response to the post-World War II United Nationsâ€™ Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) of 1948. However, even these more limited rights are mostly ignored or patchily implemented. In particular, the Cairo Declaration does little to assure the rights of religious minorities in Islamic dominated countries. Changing religion to leave Islam is defined as apostasy and may be punished severely.
