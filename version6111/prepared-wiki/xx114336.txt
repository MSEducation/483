==History==

EnterpriseDB was founded in 2004 by Denis Lussier and Andy Astor,[tpl]cite web|url=http://andyastor.blogspot.com/2009/06/leaving-enterprisedb.html|title=Leaving EDB[/tpl] with the goal of disrupting the database oligopoly with an equally capable product based on open source principles and development that offered dramatic cost savings. The company chose PostgreSQL as its technology foundation because PostgreSQL was proven by over 20 years of large-scale commercial deployments, its thriving developer community, and its reputation for being the most robust open source database available.  EnterpriseDB is presently headquartered in Massachusetts and has other offices in New Jersey, Europe, Asia and Japan.http://www.enterprisedb.com/company/offices  Ed Boyajian is the CEO.
