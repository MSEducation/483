HD 11964 is a yellow subgiant star approximately 107 light-years away in the constellation of Cetus.  The star is more massive and luminous than our Sun and is barely visible to the naked eye. A wide binary companion star was discovered in 2000.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://aa.springer.de/papers/0356002/2300529/small.htm | author=Allen et al. | title=Wide binaries among high-velocity and metal-poor stars  | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=356 | issue=2 | pages=529–540 | year=2000 |bibcode = 2000A&A...356..529A [/tpl] Two extrasolar planets have been confirmed to orbit the star.

==Planetary system==

In August 2005, two planets were discovered orbiting the star, the innermost like Neptune and another like Jupiter orbiting at 3.34 AU.  However, the second planet (HD 11964 b) was not confirmed until May 2007. In September 2007, P.C. Gregory claimed that there was a third planet in the system on the basis of Bayesian analysis of the radial velocity data. The planet was claimed to have a mass similar to that of Saturn and located in a 360-day orbit. Gregory cautioned that the close match between the period of this planet to being exactly a year meant that the radial velocity variations may have been caused by insufficient correction for the motion of the Earth in orbit around the Sun.[tpl]cite journal|title=A Bayesian periodogram finds evidence for three planets in HD 11964|author=Gregory, P.C.|year=2007|journal=MNRAS|volume=381|issue=4|pages=1607–1616|bibcode=2007MNRAS.381.1607G|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12361.x|accessdate=2008-12-14|arxiv = 0709.0970 [/tpl] The planet was not detected in re-reduced data in an analysis published in the Astrophysical Journal in 2009.
