Marche à petits pas [tpl]IPA-fr|maʁʃ a pəti pa|[/tpl] (“gait with little steps”) is a type of gait disorder characterised by an abnormal short stepped gait with upright stance (in strict sense, as opposed to generally stooping short-stepped gait of Parkinson's disease), seen in various neurological (or sometimes muscular) disorders. It can be further differentiated from "Parkinsonian gait" by normal arm swing (as opposed to no arm swing in Parkinsonism). Some people [tpl]Who|date=June 2010[/tpl] refer to all forms of short-stepped gaits, including Parkinsonian gait, as marche a petit pas in a loose sense.
