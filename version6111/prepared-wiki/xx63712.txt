Cowell attended Radlett Preparatory School and the independent Dover College as did his brother, but left after taking GCE O levels. He passed in English Language and Literature and then attended Windsor Technical College where he gained another GCE in Sociology.[tpl]cite book|date=3 September 2009|author=Chas Newkey-Burden |isbn=978-1-84317-390-8 |title=Simon Cowell: The Unauthorised Biography|publisher=Michael O’Mara Books[/tpl] At the age of 17, he dated model Paula Hamilton. Cowell took a few menial jobs—including, according to Tony, working as a runner on Stanley Kubrick's The Shining[tpl]cite news|author=Martin, Lara|date=30 April 2009|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a154489/cowell-got-break-cleaning-shining-axe.html|title=Cowell 'got break cleaning 'Shining' axe'|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=30 April 2009[/tpl]—but did not get along well with colleagues and bosses, until his father, who was an executive at the recording giant EMI Music Publishing, managed to get him a job in the mail room.

===Idol franchise and Il Divo===

Cowell was given the role of judge on the first series of Pop Idol in the UK by then ITV Controller of Entertainment Claudia Rosencrantz[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1998537.stm|title=Entertainment, Pop Idol judge hits out at Rik Waller|publisher=BBC News|date=20 May 2002|accessdate=14 December 2009[/tpl] in 2001, he was then judge on the first season of American Idol in 2002. With his notoriously critical reputation, Cowell is likened to TV personalities such as Judith Sheindlin and Anne Robinson. Though comparable to Robinson, Cowell has expressed his dislike for her and has commented in an interview, "I hate her and I hate her show because it's just an act".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20020626idol3.asp|title=TV Preview: 'American Idol' thrives on harsh sniping|publisher=Post-gazette.com|date=26 June 2002|accessdate=14 December 2009| first=Rob| last=Owen[/tpl] Cowell's prominence grew, fed by his signature phrase, "I don't mean to be rude, but ...", inevitably followed by an unsparingly blunt appraisal of the contestant's talents, personality, or even physical appearance. A lot of these one-liners were the product of coaching that Cowell received from noted publicist Max Clifford.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/12/03/knut-clifford-reputation-markets-face-cx_vr_1203autofacescan02.html|title=Knut: Get Dancing, Says Max Clifford|work=Forbes|date= 3 December 2008|accessdate=14 December 2009|first=Vidya|last=Ram[/tpl] Cowell also appeared on the one-off World Idol programme in 2003, where it became clear that each country's version of the Idol had attempted to come up with its own "Simon Cowell" type personality. In 2003, Cowell placed No 33 on Channel 4's list of the all-time 100 Worst Britons. Cowell's S Records signed the top two finishers of the first season of Pop Idol, Will Young and Gareth Gates, both of whom went on to have No 1 UK hits. Efforts begun in 2001 materialised in 2004, when Cowell returned to his group manufacturing roots with his latest brainchild, the internationally successful operatic pop group Il Divo,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/entertainment/Simon+Cowell+Divo+rejuvenated+ready/1630697/story.html|title=Story – Entertainment|publisher=Calgary Herald|date=25 October 2009|accessdate=14 December 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ruggedelegantliving.com/a/003557.html|title=The Rugged Elegance Inspiration Network: Oprah Presents: American Idol's Simon Cowell, Cowell's Il Divo & Our Diva Joss Stone|publisher=Ruggedelegantliving.com|accessdate=14 December 2009[/tpl] consisting of three opera singers and one pop singer of four different nationalities. Inspired by the success of Il Divo, Simon created a child version, Angelis, beating competition from similar groups emerging at Christmas 2006.
On 11 January 2010, Cowell's exit from American Idol was made official. The 2010 season was Cowell's last on the show. It was also announced that FOX had acquired the rights to The X Factor USA, an American version of Cowell's British show, The X Factor, which began in September 2011."Simon Cowell to Leave American Idol.", from the BBC."Fox Gets X Factor, Cowell Quits Idol".

===The X Factor===

In 2004, with Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh, Cowell was a judge on the first series of the British television music competition The X Factor, which he created using his production company, Syco. The X Factor was an instant success with the viewers and enjoyed its tenth series in 2012.

Walsh was later brought back a week into the auditions by Cowell when he and Osbourne realised that they missed Walsh and that without him, there was no chemistry between the judges. Cowell returned for the fifth series in 2008, with Walsh, Minogue and new judge Cheryl Cole, as Osbourne decided to quit before the show began.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/x-factor/x-factor-2008-cheryl-cole-will-replace-sharon-osbourne/ |title=X Factor 2008: Cheryl Cole WILL Replace Sharon Osbourne! @ Unreality TV|publisher=Unrealitytv.co.uk|date=10 June 2008|accessdate=14 December 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a99134/cheryl-cole-joins-the-x-factor.html |title=The X Factor – News – Cheryl Cole joins 'The X Factor'|publisher=Digital Spy|date=10 June 2008|accessdate=14 December 2009[/tpl] Cowell returned for series 6 and 7 as well, although series 7 was to be his last, as he left in 2011 in order to launch The X Factor in America.

===Got Talent===

Following the success of the Idol and X Factor franchises, Cowell, his company Syco, and its business partners developed a talent show format open to performers of any kind, not only singers, but also dancers, instrumentalists, magicians, comedians, novelty acts, and so on. The origins of the Got Talent format can be traced to the British show Opportunity Knocks.
Cowell is the executive producer of America's Got Talent,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20090707nbc03|title=Breaking News – Nbc'S Smash Hit Series 'America'S Got Talent' Heats Up The Summer!|publisher=TheFutonCritic.com|date=7 July 2009|accessdate=14 December 2009[/tpl] which debuted in June 2006, along with Fremantle producers of the Idol series, but he does not appear on the show due to the terms of his contract with Fox. The show was a huge success for NBC, drawing around 12 million viewers a week, and beating So You Think You Can Dance on Fox (produced by rival and Idol creator Simon Fuller).

Cowell was also the executive producer of Grease Is the Word for ITV. This show set out to find performers to play Danny and Sandy in the 2007 West End revival of Grease. It was hosted by Zoë Ball and judged by Britons David Ian and Sinitta and Americans David Gest and Brian Friedman. The musical theatre casting concept had already been introduced by the BBC with the ratings hit How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?, but Cowell's show was not the hoped for success. He himself said, "It has been slaughtered by the critics – and rightly so. It is far too similar to our other formats."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23396758-i-slipped-up-on-grease-admits-cowell.do|title=I slipped up on Grease, admits Cowell|work=Evening Standard|location=UK |date=18 May 2007|accessdate=14 August 2010[/tpl]

In 2013, Simon was executive producer for ITV cookery series Food Glorious Food, which was hosted by Carol Vorderman. He will do the same for an upcoming game show called Keep it in the Family'', presented by Bradley Walsh.
