[[List of countries by energy intensity]]

CATEGORIES: Energy-related lists by country, Energy use comparisons, Energy economics

The following is a list of countries by energy intensity, or total energy consumption per unit GDP, as published by the World Resources Institute for the year 2003. It is given in units of tonnes of oil equivalent per million constant year 2000 international dollars.

==World Energy Intensity of GDP at purchasing parities from 2006 to 2009==

The following table displays the energy intensity in the world by koe$05p unit, by region and by country. The energy intensity are published by international Enerdata and they are also available in the recent energy review for 2011.
The energy intensity is the ratio of primary energy consumption over gross domestic product measured in constant US $ at purchasing power parities.
In 2009, energy intensity in OECD countries remained stable at 0.15 koe/$05p, with 0.12 koe/$05p in both the European Union and Japan and 0.17 koe/$05p in the USA. It remained particularly high in CIS (0.35 koe/$05p) as well as in Africa (0.25 koe/$05p) and Middle East (0.26 koe/$05p). In Asia, energy intensity reached 0.22 koe/$05p. On the opposite, Latin America posted a relatively low ratio of 0.14 koe/$05p.
