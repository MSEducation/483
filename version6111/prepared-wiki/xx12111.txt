Koidz.|publisher=Germplasm Resources Information Network, USDA[/tpl] is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes cabbages, horseradish, and mustard. It is also called Japanese horseradish,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.plantnames.unimelb.edu.au/Sorting/Wasabia.html#japonica |title=Wasabia japonica |publisher=MULTILINGUAL MULTISCRIPT PLANT NAME DATABASE, The University of Melbourne[/tpl] although horseradish is a different plant (which is often used as a substitute for wasabi). Its root is used as a condiment and has an extremely strong flavor. Its hotness is more akin to that of a hot mustard than that of the capsaicin in a chili pepper, producing vapours that stimulate the nasal passages more than the tongue. The plant grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan. The two main cultivars in the marketplace are W. japonica 'Daruma' and 'Mazuma', but there are many others.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lZD95wlLhxIC&pg=PA57&dq=Daruma+mazuma#v=onepage&q=Daruma%20mazuma|title= the Best Of Growing Edge International 2000-2005|last=Growing Edge|page=57|publisher= New Moon Publishing |isbn=978-0-944557-05-1|year=2005[/tpl]

==Uses==

Wasabi is generally sold either as a root which is very finely grated before use, as dried powder in large quantities, or as a ready-to-use paste in tubes similar to travel toothpaste tubes.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wIOcYVPYfkAC&pg=PT228&dq=toothpaste#v=onepage&q=toothpaste|title=The connoisseur's guide to sushi: everything you need to know about sushi|first=Dave |last=Lowry|publisher=The Harvard Common Press|year=2005|isbn=1-55832-307-4|page=205[/tpl] In some high-end restaurants, the paste is prepared when the  customer orders, and is made using a grater to grate the root; once the paste is prepared, it loses flavour in 15 minutes if left uncovered.What's That Stuff? Wasabi | Science & Technology | Chemical & Engineering News In sushi preparation, sushi chefs usually put the wasabi between the fish and the rice because covering wasabi until served preserves its flavor.
Fresh wasabi leaves can be eaten, having the spicy flavor of wasabi roots.
Because the burning sensations of wasabi are not oil-based, they are short-lived compared to the effects of chili peppers, and are washed away with more food or liquid. The sensation is felt primarily in the nasal passage and can be quite painful depending on the amount consumed.
Legumes (peanuts, soybeans, or peas) may be roasted or fried, then coated with wasabi powder mixed with sugar, salt, or oil and eaten as a crunchy snack.  Inhaling or sniffing wasabi vapor has an effect like smelling salts, a property exploited by researchers attempting to create a smoke alarm for the deaf. One deaf subject participating in a test of the prototype awoke within 10 seconds of wasabi vapor sprayed into his sleeping chamber.[tpl]cite web|title=Wasabi Silent Fire Alarm Alerts the Deaf with the Power of Scent|url=http://inventorspot.com/articles/wasabi_silent_fire_alarm_alerts__11514|publisher=InvestorSpot|author= Levenstein, Steve [/tpl] The 2011 Ig Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the researchers for determining the ideal density of airborne wasabi to wake people in event of an emergency.

==Surrogates==

Wasabi is difficult to cultivate, and that makes it quite expensive. Due to its high cost, a common substitute is a mixture of horseradish, mustard, starch and green food coloring. Outside of Japan, it is rare to find real wasabi plants. Often packages are labeled as wasabi, but the ingredients do not actually include wasabi plant. Although the taste is similar between wasabi and horseradish, wasabi is green and hotter.[tpl]cite book |title=The No-Salt, Lowest-Sodium International Cookbook |first1=Donald A. |last1=Gazzaniga |first2= Maureen A. |last2=Gazzaniga |publisher=Macmillan |year=2007 |isbn=1466819154 |url=http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=nXyJhXZlkasC&pg=PA301&dq=%22wasabi%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=peJwUqqDPIiGkQWjt4GgBw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22wasabi%22[/tpl] In Japan, horseradish is referred to as [tpl]nihongo3|"western wasabi"|西洋わさび|seiyō wasabi[/tpl].The Sushi FAQ - Sushi Items - Wasabi In the United States, true wasabi is generally found only at specialty grocers and high-end restaurants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://effinghamdailynews.com/business/x519449241/CONDIMENTS-Wasabi-real-vs-fake|title=CONDIMENTS — Wasabi: real vs. fake[/tpl]

==Chemistry==

The chemical in wasabi that provides for its initial pungency is the volatile allyl isothiocyanate, which is produced by hydrolysis of natural rhizome thioglucosides (conjugates of the sugar glucose, and sulfur-containing organic compounds); the hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by myrosinase and occurs when the enzyme is released on cell rupture caused by maceration — e.g., grating — of the plant's rhizome.Ina, K., Ina, H., Ueda, M., Yagi, A. and Kishima, I., 1989. ω-methyl thioalkyl isothiocyanate, in wasabi. Agric. Biol. Chem. 53, pp. 537–538.H. Masuda, Y. Harada, K. Tanaka, M. Nakajima, and H. Tabeta, 1996, Characteristic Odorants of Wasabi (Wasabia japonica matum), Japanese Horseradish, in Comparison with Those of Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana), Biotechnology for Improved Foods and Flavors, Ch. 6, ACS Symposium Series, Vol. 637, pp 67–78.http://www.freshwasabi.com/tech.aspx; accessed 11 February 2011.
The unique flavor of wasabi is a result of complex chemical mixtures from the broken cells of the rhizome, including those resulting from the hydrolysis of thioglucosides into glucose and methylthioalkyl isothiocyanates:Ina et al. 1989, ibid.Masuda et al. 1996, ibid.Arnaud, Celia Henry. What's That Stuff? Wasabi. Chemical and Engineering News, Vol. 88, No. 12 (March 22, 2010), p. 48
Research has shown that such isothiocyanates inhibit microbe growth, perhaps with implications for preserving food against spoilage and suppressing oral bacterial growth.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=TdQtFQZ5XCQC&pg=PA12&dq=antimicrobial+isothiocyanates|title=Food preservation techniques|first1=P. |last1=Zeuthen|first2=Leif|last2=Bøgh-Sørensen|page=12|publisher=Woodhead Publishing Limited|year=2003|isbn=978-1-85573-530-9[/tpl]

==Cultivation==

Few places are suitable for large-scale wasabi cultivation, and cultivation is difficult even in ideal conditions. In Japan, wasabi is cultivated mainly in these regions:
There are also numerous artificial cultivation facilities as far north as Hokkaido and as far south as Kyushu. As the demand for real wasabi is very high, Japan has to import a large amount of it from China, Ali Mountain of Taiwan, and New Zealand.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] In North America, a handful of companies and small farmers cultivate Wasabia japonica.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Preparation==

Wasabi is often grated with a metal oroshigane, but some prefer to use a more traditional tool made of dried sharkskin with fine skin on one side and coarse skin on the other. A hand-made grater with irregular teeth can also be used. If a shark-skin grater is unavailable, ceramic is usually preferred.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=vGGSh3PSwQAC&pg=PA71#v=onepage&q=|title=Washoku: recipes from the Japanese home kitchen |first1=Elizabeth |last1=Andoh|first2=Leigh |last2=Beisch|publisher=Ten Speed Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58008-519-9|page=71[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The two kanji characters "[tpl]lang|ja|山[/tpl]" and "[tpl]lang|ja|葵[/tpl]" do not correspond to their pronunciation in Japanese. The two characters actually refer to the Chinese word for mountain Asarum, as the plant's leaves resemble those of a member of Asarum species, in addition to its ability to grow on shady hillsides. The word, in the form [tpl]lang|ja|和佐比[/tpl], using the characters' original Chinese pronunciations to approximate the Japanese word wasabi, first appears in the Heian period work [tpl]Nihongo|The Japanese Names of Medical Herbs|本草和名|Honzō Wamyō[/tpl], written in 918.
