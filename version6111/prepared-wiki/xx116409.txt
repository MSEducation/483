==History==

Education in Bromyard can be traced back to 1394 when a chantry school was founded. After the dissolution of the chantries, the school was granted a charter for its re-foundation as a Boy's Grammar School by Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1566.
In 1958, the Grammar School, which had been admitting boys and girls from the beginning of this century, combined with the secondary school established in 1961 to open the school as Bromyard County Secondary School in 1963.
In 1976, Sixth Form education was concentrated at Hereford Sixth Form College and this school became a comprehensive school catering for pupils aged 11 to 16.
Since 2007, the college has progressed notably, producing high GCSE results that challenge the title of the best results in Herefordshire.[tpl]cn|date=October 2013[/tpl] On 1 December 2011, the school officially gained academy status.
A former pupil of the school was Robin Chater, Secretary-General of the Federation of European Employers
