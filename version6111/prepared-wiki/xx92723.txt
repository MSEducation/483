L'Année Sociologique is a sociology journal founded in 1898 by Émile Durkheim, who also served as its editor. It was published annually until 1925, and returned to publication as L'Annales Sociologiques between 1934 and 1942. After World War II it returned to publication as L'Année Sociologique and remains in publication today.
Durkheim founded L'Année Sociologique as a way of publicizing his own research and the research of his students and other scholars working within his new sociological paradigm. As a result of this the term is also used to refer to the distinctive approach of this group and the work they produced in the first two decades of the twentieth century.
Members of the L'Année Sociologique group include Émile Durkheim, Célestin Bouglé, Marcel Mauss, Henri Hubert, Robert Hertz, Maurice Halbwachs, and François Simiand among others.
