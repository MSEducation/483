The First Government of the Republic of Croatia ([tpl]lang-hr|Prva Vlada Republike Hrvatske[/tpl]) was the Croatian Government announced on 30 May 1990 after the first multi-party elections ended Communist Party rule, while Croatia was still a federal unit within SFR Yugoslavia. The prime minister (president of the government) was Stjepan Mesić of the Croatian Democratic Union.  The cabinet was reformed on 24 August 1990 when Stjepan Mesić left Zagreb to assume the Croatian seat at the Yugoslav collective presidency following armed insurrection by ethnic Serbs.[tpl]cite web | url = http://hidran.hidra.hr/hidrarad/rh/rh61.htm | language = Croatian | title = Prva vlada | publisher = Croatian Information-Documentation Referral Agency | accessdate = 2010-12-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hidra.hr/cro/hr_vodic/kronologija_vlade|publisher=Croatian Information-Documentation and Referral Agency - HIDRA|language=Croatian|title=Kronologija Vlade|trans_title=Chronology of the Government|accessdate=2011-12-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=Government of Croatia|url=http://www.vlada.hr/hr/naslovnica/o_vladi_rh/prethodne_vlade_rh|language=Croatian|title=Prethodne vlade RH|trans_title=Previous governments of the Republic of Croatia|accessdate=2011-12-11[/tpl]Sastav 1.
