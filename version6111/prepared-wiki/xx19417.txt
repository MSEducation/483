Chinese Americans constitute one group of overseas Chinese and also a subgroup of East Asian Americans, which is further a subgroup of Asian Americans. Many Chinese Americans are immigrants along with their descendants from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, as well as from other countries in Southeast Asia and South America that include large populations of the Chinese diaspora.[tpl]Cite book|title=The Taiwanese Americans|first=Franklin|last=Ng|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=978-0-313-29762-5|pages=2, 118, 126|postscript=[/tpl]
Overall demographic research tends to include immigrants from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan as well as overseas Chinese who have immigrated from South East Asia and South America into the broadly defined Chinese American category as both the governments of the Republic of China and the United States refer Taiwanese Americans as a separate subgroup of Chinese Americans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/SF4-race.html|title=Race groups|publisher=United States Census Bureau|date=9 August 2002|accessdate=21 March 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ocac.gov.tw/english/public/public.asp?selno=706&level=C&no=683|title=About OCAC|publisher=Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission, R.O.C.

The Chinese American community is the largest overseas Chinese community in North America. It is also the fourth largest in the Chinese diaspora, behind the Chinese communities in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The Chinese American community comprises the largest and oldest ethnic group of Asian Americans, comprising 25.9% of the Asian American population as of 2010. Americans of Chinese descent, including those with partial Chinese ancestry constitute 1.2% of the total U.S. population as of 2010. According to the 2010 census, the Chinese American population numbered approximately 3.8 million. In 2010, half of Chinese-born people living in the United States lived either in California or New York State.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/USFocus/display.cfm?ID=876|title=Chinese Immigrants in the United States|publisher=Migration Policy Institute|date=January 2012|accessdate=30 June 2012[/tpl]

==History==

The first Chinese immigrants arrived in 1820, according to U.S. government records. 325 men are known to have arrived before the 1849 California Gold RushBill Bryson, Made In America,page 154 which drew the first significant number of laborers from China who mined for gold and performed menial labor.[tpl]cite book|title=Strangers From a Different Shore|author=Ronald Takaki|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1998|isbn=0-316-83109-3|page=28|authorlink=Ronald Takaki[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The Chinese in America|author=Iris Chang|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-670-03123-2|pages=34–35|authorlink=Iris Chang[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Chinese America|author=Peter Kwong and Dusanka Miscevic|publisher=The New Press|year=2005|isbn=1-56584-962-0|page=44[/tpl] There were 25,000 immigrants by 1852, and 105,465 by 1880, most of whom lived on the West Coast. They formed over a tenth of California's population. Nearly all of the early immigrants were young males with low educational levels from six districts in Guangdong Province.International World History Project. Asian Americans. Accessed 2014-03-14.
The Chinese came to California in large numbers during the California Gold Rush, with 40,400 being recorded as arriving from 1851–1860, and again in the 1860s, when the Central Pacific Railroad recruited large labor gangs, many on five-year contracts, to build its portion of the Transcontinental Railroad. The Chinese laborers worked out well and thousands more were recruited until the railroad's completion in 1869. Chinese labor provided the massive workforce needed to build the majority of the Central Pacific's difficult route through the Sierra Nevada mountains and across Nevada.
The Chinese population rose from 2,716 in 1851 to 63,000 by 1871. In the decade 1861-70, 64,301 were recorded as arriving, followed by 123,201 in 1871-80 and 61,711 in 1881-1890. 77% were located in California, with the rest scattered across the West, the South, and New England.[tpl]cite book | title=Strangers From A Different Shore: A History of Asian Americans| last=Takaki| first=Ronald|year=1998| publisher=Back Bay Books| location=New York[/tpl] Most came from Southern China looking for a better life, escaping a high rate of poverty left after the Taiping Rebellion.
The initial immigration group may have been as high as 90% male, because most immigrants came with the thought of earning money, and then returning to China to start a family. Those that stayed in America faced the lack of suitable Chinese brides, because Chinese women were not allowed to immigrate to the US in significant numbers after 1872. As a result, many isolated mostly-bachelor communities slowly aged in place with very low Chinese birth rates. Later, as a result of the Fourteenth Amendment and the 1898 United States v. Wong Kim Ark Supreme Court decision, ethnic Chinese born in the United States became American citizens.
During and after World War II, severe immigration restrictions were eased as the United States allied with China against Japanese expansionism. Later reforms in the 1960s placed increasing value on family unification, allowing relatives of U.S. citizens to receive preference in immigration.
The Chinese American experience has been documented at the Museum of Chinese in America in Manhattan's Chinatown since 1980.

According to the 2012 Census estimates,[tpl]cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_1YR_DP05&prodType=table|title=ACS DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING ESTIMATES 2012 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates New York-Newark-Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA CSA|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=27 October 2013[/tpl] the three metropolitan areas with the largest Chinese American populations were the Greater New York Combined Statistical Area at 735,019 people, the San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland Combined Statistical Area at 629,243 people, and the Greater Los Angeles Combined Statistical Area at about 566,968 people. New York City is home to the highest Chinese American population of any city proper (522,619), while the Los Angeles County city of Monterey Park has the highest percentage of Chinese Americans of any municipality, at 43.7% of its population, or 24,758 people.
The states with the largest estimated Chinese American populations, according to both the 2010 Census, were California (1,253,100; 3.4%), New York (577,000; 3.0%), Texas (157,000; 0.6%), New Jersey (134,500; 1.5%), Massachusetts (123,000; 1.9%), Illinois (104,200; 0.8%), Washington (94,200; 1.4%), Pennsylvania (85,000; 0.7%), Maryland (69,400; 1.2%), Virginia (59,800; 0.7%), and Ohio (51,033; 0.5%). The state of Hawaii has the highest concentration of Chinese Americans at 4.0%, or 55,000 people.
The New York City Metropolitan Area, consisting of New York City, Long Island, and nearby areas within the states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, is home to the largest Chinese American population of any metropolitan area within the United States, enumerating 682,265 individuals as of the 2010 United States Census,[tpl]citation|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1|title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data New York-Newark-Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA CSA|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=27 June 2012[/tpl] and including at least nine Chinatowns.

Also on the East Coast, the Washington, Boston, and Philadelphia metropolitan areas have significant Chinese American communities. The Washington, D.C. suburbs of Montgomery County, Maryland, and Fairfax County, Virginia, are 3.9% and 2.4% Chinese American, respectively. Boston's Chinatown is the only historical Chinese neighborhood within New England. The Boston suburb of Quincy also has a prominent Chinese American population, especially within the North Quincy area.
San Francisco, California has the highest per capita concentration of Chinese Americans of any major city in the United States, at an estimated 21.4%, or 172,181 people, and contains the second-largest total number of Chinese Americans of any U.S. city. San Francisco's Chinatown was established in the 1840s, making it the oldest Chinatown in North America and one of the largest neighborhoods of Chinese people outside of Asia,www.Chinatownology.comUnited Parcel Service Community Site composed in large part by immigrants hailing from Guangdong province and also many from Hong Kong. The San Francisco neighborhoods of Sunset District and Richmond District also contain significant Chinese populations.
In addition to the big cities, smaller pockets of Chinese Americans are also dispersed in rural towns, often university-college towns, throughout the United States. For example, the number of Chinese Americans, including college professors, doctors, professionals, and students, has increased over 200% from 2005 to 2010 in Providence, Rhode Island, a small city with a large number of colleges.
Income and social status of these Chinese-American locations vary widely. Although many Chinese Americans in Chinatowns of large cities are often members of an impoverished working class, others are well-educated upper-class people living in affluent suburbs. The upper and lower-class Chinese are also widely separated by social status and class discrimination. In California's San Gabriel Valley, for example, the cities of Monterey Park and San Marino are both Chinese American communities lying geographically close to each other but they are separated by a large socio-economic and income gap.
A third of a million Chinese Americans are not United States citizens.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/what-chinas-talking-about-today-is-american-citizenship-still-desirable/254070/ |title=What China's Talking About Today: Is American Citizenship Still Desirable? |last1=Hayoun |first1=Massoud |date=7 March 2012 |work=The Atlantic |publisher=Atlantic Media Company |accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl]

==Influence on American culture==

Some noteworthy historical Chinese contributions include building the western half of the Transcontinental Railroad, and levees in the Sacramento River Delta; the popularization of Chinese American food; technological innovation and entrepreneurship; and the introduction of Chinese and East Asian culture to America, such as Buddhism, Taoism, and Kung fu.
Chinese immigrants to the United States brought many of their ideas and values with them. Some of these have continued to influence later generations. Among them is Confucian respect for elders, and filial piety.Haiming Liu (2005) "Asian-American Ideas (Cultural Migration)" In Horowitz, Maryanne Cline (editor) (2005) New Dictionary of the History of Ideas Charles Scribner's Sons, Detroit, Michigan, volume 1, pp. 158-160, ISBN 0-684-31377-4 Similarly, education and the civil service were the most important path for upward social mobility in China.Semple, Kirk (21 August 2008) "Among Chinese-Americans, a Split on Sports" The New York Times page B-2 The first Broadway show about Asian Americans was Flower Drum Song;Berson, Misha.

In most American cities with significant Chinese populations, the new year is celebrated with cultural festivals and parties. In Seattle, the Chinese Culture and Arts Festival is held every year. Other important festivals include the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival.
Analysis indicated that most non-Asian Americans do not differentiate between Chinese Americans and East Asian Americans generally, and perceptions of both groups are nearly identical.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.committee100.org/media/media_eng/042501.html |author=Committee of 100 |title=Committee of 100 Announces Results of Landmark National Survey on American Attitudes towards Chinese Americans and Asian Americans |date=25 April 2001 |accessdate=14 June 2007[/tpl] A 2001 survey of Americans' attitudes toward Asian Americans and Chinese Americans indicated that one fourth of the respondents had somewhat or very negative attitude toward Chinese Americans in general.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/04/27/MN199998.DTL |author=Matthew Yi, et al. |title=Asian Americans seen negatively |accessdate=14 June 2007 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |date=27 April 2001[/tpl] The study did find several positive perceptions of Chinese Americans: strong family values (91%); honesty as entrepreneurs (77%); high value on education (67%).

==Language==

Chinese, mostly Yue dialects including Taishanese and Cantonese, is the third most-spoken language in the United States, almost completely spoken within Chinese American populations and by immigrants or the descendants of immigrants, especially in California.[tpl]cite book | last = Lai | first = H. Mark | title = Becoming Chinese American: A History of Communities and Institutions | publisher = AltaMira Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-7591-0458-1[/tpl] Over 2 million Americans speak some variety of Chinese, with Standard Chinese becoming increasingly common due to immigration from mainland China and Taiwan.
In New York City at least, although Mandarin is spoken as a native language among only ten percent of Chinese speakers, it is used as a secondary dialect among the greatest number of them and is on the way to replacing Cantonese as their lingua franca.[tpl]cite book | last = García | first = Ofelia | coauthors = Fishman, Joshua A. | title = The Multilingual Apple: Languages in New York City | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2002 | isbn = 3-11-017281-X[/tpl] In addition, immigration from Fujian is bringing an increasingly large number of Min speakers. Wu dialects, previously unheard of in the United States, are now spoken by a minority of recent Chinese immigrants hailing from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai.
Although Chinese Americans grow up learning English, some teach their children Chinese for a variety of reasons: preservation of an ancient civilization, preservation of a unique identity, pride in their cultural ancestry, desire for easy communication with them and other relatives, and the perception that Chinese will be a very useful language as China's economic strength increases. Cantonese, historically the language of most Chinese immigrants, is the third most widely spoken non-English language in the United States.[tpl]cite book | last = Lai | first = H.

==Religion==

The Chinese American community differs from the rest of the population in that the majority of Chinese Americans do not report a religious affiliation. 43% of Chinese Americans switched to a different religion and 54% stayed within their childhood religion within their lifetime. According to the Pew Research Center's 2012 Asian-American Survey, 52% of Chinese Americans aged 15 and over said that they didn't have any religious affiliation. This is also compared with the religious affiliation of Asian American average of 26% and a national average of 19%.
Of Chinese Americans who were religious, 15% were Buddhist, 8% were Catholic, and 22% belonged to a Protestant denomination. Fully half of Chinese Americans (52%)—including 55% of those born in the U.S. and 51% of those born overseas—describe themselves as religiously unaffiliated. Because Chinese Americans are the largest subgroup of Asian Americans, nearly half of all religiously unaffiliated Asians in the U.S. are of Chinese descent (49%).

==Politics==

Chinese Americans are divided among many subgroups based on factors such as age, nativity, and socioeconomic status and do not have uniform attitudes about the People's Republic of China or the Republic of China, about the United States, or about Chinese nationalism. Different subgroups of Chinese Americans also have radically different and sometimes very conflicting political priorities and goals.[tpl]such as?[/tpl] In 2013, Chinese Americans were the least likely Asian American ethnicity to be affiliated with a political party.[tpl]cite news |title=Asian-American Vote Reveals Nuances |author=Matthew Hilburn |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/polling-asian-americans-nuanced/1586148.html |newspaper=Voice of America |date=17 January 2013 |accessdate=24 January 2013 |quote=Chinese-Americans were the least likely to affiliate with a party. Magpantay suggested that only one third of Chinese-Americans belong to a party, compared with 71 percent among all Asian-Americans, because of the negative association of the word party with the Communist Party in China. [/tpl]
Nonetheless, Chinese Americans are clustered in majority-Democratic states and have increasingly voted Democratic in recent presidential elections, following the trend for Asian Americans in general.http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/the-power-of-the-asian-american-vote-is-growing-and-it-s-up-for-grabs-20121025 Polling just before the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election found John Kerry was favored by 58% of Chinese Americans and George W.

In the 2012 presidential election, 81% of Chinese American voters selected Barack Obama over Mitt Romney.http://colorlines.com/archives/2013/01/asian-american_voters_really_really_loved_barack_obama_in_election_2012.html
Chinese Americans were an important source of funds for Han revolutionaries during the later Qing dynasty, and Sun Yat-sen was raising money in America at the time of the Xinhai Revolution, which established the Republic of China. During the Cultural Revolution, Chinese Americans, as overseas Chinese in general, were viewed as capitalist traitors by the PRC government. This attitude changed dramatically in the late 1970s with the reforms of Deng Xiaoping. Increasingly, Chinese Americans were seen as sources of business and technical expertise and capital who could aid in China's economic and other development.

==Immigration==

Economic growth in the People's Republic of China has given mainland Chinese more opportunities to emigrate. A 2011 survey showed that 60% of Chinese millionaires plan to emigrate and 40 percent of Chinese millionaires selecting the United States as the top destination for immigration.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/11/world/asia/china-rich-emigration/index.html | work=CNN | title=As China's rich grow in numbers, so do their mobile aspirations - CNN.com | date=21 November 2011[/tpl]Chinese millionaires seek for overseas activities-China Invests Overseas - China Business Network[tpl]cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203806504577181461401318988.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Plan B for China's Wealthy: Moving to the U.S., Europe - WSJ.com[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/01/report-half-of-chinas-rich-want-to-leave/ | work=CNN | title=Report: Half of Chinaâs millionaires want to leave | date=1 November 2011[/tpl]Chinese rich are keen to emigrate, China Daily, 3 November 2011The Mass Migration of the Super-Rich - U.S. Business News - CNBC The EB-5 Investment Visa allows many powerful Chinese to seek U.S. citizenship, and recent reports show that 75% of applicants for this visa in 2011 were Chinese.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-18966261 | work=BBC News | title=Rich Chinese seeking overseas residency | date=22 August 2012[/tpl]美国投资移民中国人占四分三 - 3/4 of Investment Immigrants to the USA are Chinese (bilingual), Thinking Chinese, November 2011 Chinese multimillionaires benefited most from the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program in the U.S. Now, as long as one has at least US$500,000 to invest in projects listed by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), where it is possible to get an EB-5 green card that comes with permanent U.S. residency rights, but only in states specified by the pilot project.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ecns.cn/2012/02-02/7365.shtml |title=U.S., Canada favored by China's third wave of emigrants - Headlines, features, photo and videos from |publisher=ecns.cn |accessdate=7 May 2012[/tpl]China’s capital flight: to US real estate |beyondbrics

As a result of its growing economy and large population, more middle-class families from China are able to afford American college tuition, bringing an influx of Chinese students to study abroad in the United States. With a more diverse educational background and higher level of English proficiency, international Chinese students also value American degrees, as it gives them a notable advantage over their college-educated counterparts in China by the time they return to their native country to seek employment.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/education/4266771-418/chinas-new-crop-of-------exports--students.html | title=Chinese students enrolling in U.S. colleges in record numbers | publisher=Chicago Sun Times | date=4 August 2011 | accessdate=29 May 2012[/tpl]

===Employment===

There has been a significant change in the perceptions about Chinese Americans. In as little as 100 years of American history, stereotypes of Chinese Americans have changed to portraying a hard working and educated minority. Thus, most Chinese Americans work as white collar professionals, many of whom are highly educated, salaried professionals whose work is largely self-directed in management, professional, and related occupations such as engineering, medicine, investment banking, law, and academia. 53.1% of Chinese Americans work in many white collar professions compared with 48.1% for all Asian Americans and a national average of 35.1%. They make up two percent of working physicians in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cis.org/articles/1998/DocsandNurses.html |title=Doctors and Nurses: A Demographic Profile |publisher=Cis.org |accessdate=31 December 2011[/tpl] Chinese Americans also make up a third of the Asian American high tech professional workforce and a tenth of the entire Silicon Valley workforce.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.modelminority.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=227:chinese-american-contributions-to-silicon-valley-&catid=47:society&Itemid=56 |title=Chinese American Contributions to Silicon Valley |publisher=Modelminority.com |date=31 March 2003 |accessdate=21 April 2012[/tpl] Chinese Americans also hold lower unemployment rates than the population average with a figure of 4.7% compared to a national rate of 5.9% in 2010.
Many Chinese Americans have turned to the high tech center to jump-start potential computer and internet startups to capitalize on the regions wealth of venture capital, business expertise, and cultural and financial incentives for innovation. Ethnic Chinese have been successful in starting new firms in technology centers across the United States, including California's Silicon Valley. Chinese Americans have been disproportionately successful in high technology sectors, as evidenced by the Goldsea 100 Compilation of America's Most Successful Asian Entrepreneurs.[tpl]cite web | url=http://goldsea.com/Profiles/100/100.html | title=100 Most Successful Asian American Entrepreneurs [/tpl] Chinese Americans accounted for 4 percent of people listed in the 1998 Forbes Hi Tech 100 List.
Annalee Saxenian, a UC Berkeley professor, whose research interests include the contribution of Chinese immigrants on America's technology concludes that in Silicon Valley, carried out a study that showed that since 1998, one out of five high tech start-ups in Silicon Valley were led by Chinese Americans. During the same year, 5 of the 8 fastest growing companies had Chinese American CEO's except for Yahoo, whose Jerry Yang was a founder but not a CEO. In Silicon Valley there are at least 2 to 3 dozen Chinese American organizations according to professional interests each with at least 100 members. One prominent organization of which is the Committee of 100.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.modelminority.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=227:chinese-american-contributions-to-silicon-valley-&catid=47:society&Itemid=56 | title=Chinese American Contributions to Silicon Valley[/tpl] Immigrants from China and Taiwan were key founders in 12.8% of all Silicon Valley start-ups between 1995 to 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://careerbright.com/tag/immigrant-entrepreneurs |title=Immigrant Entrepreneurs |publisher=Careerbright |accessdate=21 April 2012[/tpl] Almost 6% of the immigrants who founded companies in the innovation/manufacturing-related services field are from Mainland China and Taiwan.[tpl]cite web|author=12 January 2007 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/IA12Df01.html |title=Asia Times Online :: South Asia news - More foreign cogs in the US engine |publisher=Atimes.com |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=21 April 2012[/tpl]
Research funded by the Public Policy Institute of California indicates that in 1996, 1,786 Silicon Valley technology companies with $12.5 billion in sales and 46,000 employees were run by Indian or Chinese executives. Moreover, the pace of entrepreneurship among local immigrants is increasing rapidly. While Chinese or Indian executives are at the helm of 13 percent of the Silicon Valley technology businesses started between 1980 and 1985, they are running 27 percent of the more than 4,000 businesses started between 1991 and 1996.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ppic.org/main/commentary.asp?i=206 |title=A Valley Asset: Chinese, Indians Creating Businesses, Jobs, Wealth As Successful Entrepreneurs (PPIC Commentary) |publisher=Ppic.org |date=21 June 1998 |accessdate=21 April 2012[/tpl] Start-up firms remain a primary source for new ideas and innovation for Chinese American internet entrepreneurs.

===Economics===

With their above average educational attainment rates, Chinese Americans from all socioeconomic backgrounds have achieved significant advances in their educational levels, income, life expectancy and other social indicators as the financial and socioeconomic opportunities offered by the United States have lifted many Chinese Americans out of poverty, bringing them into the ranks of America's middle class, upper middle class, as well as the enjoyment of substantial well being.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/apsd/wepeople/we-3.pdf|format=PDF|author=U.S. Government|title=U.S. economics|accessdate=25 March 2012[/tpl]
Chinese Americans are more likely to own homes than the general American population.

According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Chinese American men had a full-time median income of $57,061 and Chinese American women had a median income of $47,224. Chinese Americans also have one of the highest median household incomes among most demographic groups in the United States, which is 30 percent higher than the national average but is slightly lower compared with the Asian American population.
Despite these positive economic indicators, a number of economic deterrents have been noted to afflict the Chinese American community. While median income remains above all other major ethnic groups in the United States, studies in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis revealed that Asian men have the highest rate of persistent long-term unemployment.http://www.voanews.com/content/long_term_unemployment_hits_asian_americans_hardest/1105574.html
Belying the model minority myth are a number of other conflicting economic indicators. By percentage of population, Chinese Americans are highly underrepresented amongst all major forms of economic leadership, with minimal presences in key positions across both public and corporate America. This phenomena has been coined the "bamboo ceiling", giving a name to the economic factors that seem to prevent Chinese Americans from achieving highly paid positions in the United States.Bamboo ceiling
The recent rise in the Chinese American population has largely been fueled by educational immigration, with young Chinese flooding American universities in the hopes of increasing personal wealth through work opportunities post graduation.http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2013-09/17/content_16975662.htm Many of these young Chinese wish to stay. But recent studies suggest that Chinese Americans are having an extremely difficult time in the U.S. economy, with over 70% of all recent immigrants failing to find employment post-graduation. Many immigrants are then forced to return to China after failing to find jobs in the United States.[tpl]cite news| url=http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/03/27/chinese-students-struggle-for-returns-on-education-in-u-s/ | work=The Wall Street Journal[/tpl] Further studies have shown that the more educated an Asian American, the more likely they are to earn wages below a similarly educated American of another ethnicity. Ironically, Asian Americans with only a high school diploma are more likely to be employed, and paid more than an American of similarly low educational attainment.http://www.epi.org/publication/ib323-asian-american-unemployment/ These factors have given rise to questioning the wisdom of Chinese immigration to the United States for greater economic opportunity.
