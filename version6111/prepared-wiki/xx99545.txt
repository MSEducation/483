[[Coburg Dock]]

CATEGORIES: Liverpool docks

Coburg Dock is a dock, on the River Mersey and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the southern dock system, connected to Queens Dock to the north, Brunswick Dock to the south. 
The dock was opened in 1840 and provided direct river access. This passage fell into disuse and was subsequently sealed up.
In 1986, the large grain silo near the dock basin was demolished.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.chesterwalls.info/gallery/silo1.html |title=Grain silo and Coburg Dock Marina, 1986|publisher=Black & White Picture Place|accessdate=5 July 2009[/tpl]
This and the other docks in the southern system are owned by British Waterways. Part of the dock is set aside for moorings.
South Ferry Basin or 'The Cockle Hole', a small open basin to the south, was little known under its own name and often confused as being part of Coburg Dock.
