Deivanai is the daughter of Brahma, who was left under the care of Indra's white elephant Airavata. Hence, she was named Deivayanai (divine one brought up by an elephant). She was as Amritavalli, the daughter of Maha Vishnu in her previous birth. She along with her sister Sundaravalli, undertook a severe penance to become the consort of Murugan. The Lord pleased by their devotion, appeared before them and gave the boon of marriage in their next birth.

==Muruga's birth and marriage==

The demon Tarakasur was granted with a boon by Lord Brahma that he would not be defeated by anyone other than a son born to Lord Shiva. Shiva was under severe penance separate from his consort, Goddess Sati. Tarakasur thought that Shiva's penance cannot be disturbed and there would be no offspring born to him. Armed with the boon, the demon along with his allies tormented the devas, drove out Lord Indra and conquered swarga (heaven). Vishnu, along with the devas got Lord Shiva married to Goddess Parvati. Lord Arumugan (six faced lord) was born and was destined to vanquish the demon Tarakasur.
Lord Kartikeya led the army of devas and defeated the demon Tarakasur's forces at Tiruchendur. He restored the kingdom of heaven to Indra. Indra requested Him to marry his daughter Deivanai. Kartikeya consented and the wedding took place at Thirupparamkunram, which is also one of the Arupadaiveedu on the day of Panguni Uthram.
