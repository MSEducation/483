Volume 3: The Province of Baltimore and the Province of New York, Section 1: Comprising the Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn, Buffalo and Ogdensburg Together with some Supplementary Articles on Religious Communities of Women.. (New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p.389-390. "The old Church of Our Lady of Mercy on the grounds of Fordham University, having reverted to the use for which it was originally intended, it became necessary to provide a church for the Catholics of that vicinity, who had for years attended the old church within the college gates. Rev. C. Rigney, formerly pastor of St. Joseph's Church, Rossville, Staten Island, was appointed to organize the parish, and began his work in 1892. He secured the old club-house of the Tammany Society and altered it into a church structure. His first assistant was the Rev. Edmund W. Cronin, and he was afterward assisted by Revs. Michael F. Horan and James A. Collins. The rector, Rev. Patrick N. Breslin, is assisted by Revs. Justin J. Lyons and Martin P. O'Gara."
