==History==

 
The Government Law Center was founded in 1978, the product of a grant initiated at the federal level and administered by New York State through the New York State Department of State, under the leadership of Mario M. Cuomo as then-Secretary of State. Cuomo worked with Albany Law School Professors Sandra Stevenson and Bernard Harvith to secure a grant through the United States Office of Personnel Management and the United States Civil Service Commission.[tpl]cite news|last=Hawksley|first=Jane|title=Albany's government law center serves as model|newspaper=The Business Review|date=October 26, 1998[/tpl]
Professor Sandra Stevenson served as the GLC's Director for a few months before J. Langdon Marsh became the first full-time director of the GLC on March 1, 1979[tpl]cite journal|last=Salkin|first=Patricia|title=Teaching Government Law & Policy in Law School: Reflections on Twenty-Five Years of Experience|journal=Albany Law Review|year=2003|volume=66|pages=101–133[/tpl] The Center contracted with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to prepare its first state legal report in 1980, titled "Selected Legal Problems in the Control of Hazardous Wastes." The Center proceeded to enter into contracts with several New York State agencies, including the New York State Department of Social Services, Adirondack Park Agency, New York State Department of State, New York State Department of Health, and with the New York State Legislature, to produce reports and offer training. Under Marsh's direction, the Center also focused on issues related to hazardous waste, zoning and planning, environmental quality review, economic development, and local government.
Marsh left the Center in July 1983, and for a brief time following, Joseph W. Bellacosa served as the Center's director. He subsequently was appointed by then-New York State Governor Mario M. Cuomo to serve as a Judge on the Court of Claims and Chief Administrative Judge of all State Courts, followed by a fourteen-year term on the New York Court of Appeals.
In 1983, Professor Sandra M. Stevenson was re-appointed Associate Dean and Director of the Government Law Center, assuming the position she had held in the first months of the Center's existence. During her tenure, the GLC conducted training programs in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and tying ADR to intellectual property. Under Stevenson's leadership in 1989, Albany Law School and the Government Law Center became the official repository for tapes of oral arguments heard before the New York Court of Appeals.
In 1990, Professor George F. Carpinello was appointed Director. Under Carpinello, the Center introduced the Warren M. Anderson Legislative Breakfast Seminar Series, a series focused on topics of interest to legislators and policy makers, named for the former President Pro Tem and Majority Leader of the New York State Senate. The GLC also began producing a newsletter for the County Attorneys Association of New York State (CAASNY), prepared the first edition of Legal Careers in New York State Government (with later editions published by the New York State Bar Association), and placed student interns in the counsel's office of various state agencies.
Patricia E. Salkin, Raymond and Ella Smith Distinguished Professor of Law and Associate Dean of Albany Law School, was appointed Director of the GLC in 1992, and served as the Center's Director until her appointment as dean of the Touro College Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center in 2012. In the first years under Salkin's leadership, the GLC began the Edgar and Margaret Sandman Fellowship in Aging and Health Law, and created the Senior Citizen's Law Day, a day-long program providing local seniors with free seminars on important issues related to aging. The Aging Law and Policy Program was established in 1994 to focus on issues related to aging.
In 1994, the GLC also received funding through the United States Department of Education to create the Mediation Assistance Program to train and state-certify law and non-law students as volunteer mediators for New York's Community Dispute Settlement Program,[tpl]cite journal|last=Salkin|first=Patricia|title=Teaching Government Law & Policy in Law School: Reflections on Twenty-Five Years of Experience|journal=Albany Law Review|year=2003|volume=66|pages=102–133[/tpl] leading to the establishment of the Program on Public Policy Dispute Resolution to focus on issues emerging in this field.
In the years that followed, a number of additional programs were initiated. The Lawrence F. Klepper Legal Assistance Program for Non-Profit Organizations, helping to place law students with attorneys who provide pro bono or very low-cost services to nonprofits, was established at the GLC in 1994 by friends of the former Executive Director of the Legal Aid Society and with the support of Congregation Beth Emeth.[tpl]cite news|last=DeMare|first=Carol|title=Government Law Center to Mark 25 Years of Service|newspaper=Times Union|date=February 20, 2003[/tpl] The Edwin L. Crawford Memorial Lecture in Municipal Law was launched in 1996 to address issues of state and national importance to municipal officials. In 1998, the GLC's Government Law Network began as a way for people working in or with government to meet key law and policy makers at exclusive "Networking Breakfast" forums.
