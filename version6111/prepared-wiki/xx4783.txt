The initial implementation, written by "Trench" and "HappyCrappy", was a script for the IrcII chat client. It was converted to a program in its own right by panasync (Colten Edwards). BitchX 1.1 final was released in 2004. It is written in C, and is a console application. GTK+ toolkit support has been dropped. It works on all Unix-like operating systems, and is distributed under a BSD license. It is originally based on ircII-EPIC and eventually it was merged into the EPIC IRC client.

==Security==

It was known that early versions of BitchX were vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack in that they could be caused to crash by passing specially-crafted strings as arguments to certain IRC commands. This was before format string attacks became a well-known class of vulnerability.[tpl]cite book |title=Hack Proofing Your Network |author=Ryan Russell |year=2002 |publisher=Syngress |page=329 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=v8bp4mvpYc4C&pg=RA2-PA329&dq=BitchX&lr=&ei=9xTTR7DdEIWusgP2y8ykBQ&sig=OsfVrtGM6NSjSACXwjNCrJlcayA[/tpl]
The previous version of BitchX, released in 2004, has security problems allowing remote IRC servers to execute arbitrary code on the client's machine (CVE-2007-3360, CVE-2007-4584).
On April 26, 2009, Slackware removed BitchX from its distribution, citing the numerous unresolved security issues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slackware.com/security/viewer.php?l=slackware-security&y=2009&m=slackware-security.285737 |title=The Slackware Linux Project: Slackware Security Advisories |publisher=Slackware.com |date=2009-04-26 |accessdate=2011-07-09[/tpl]
However these vulnerabilities were fixed in the sources for the 1.2 release.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bitchx.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bitchx?view=revision&revision=5 |title=SourceForge.net Repository - bitchx Revision 5 |publisher=Bitchx.svn.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2011-07-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://bitchx.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bitchx?view=revision&revision=6 |title=SourceForge.net Repository - bitchx Revision 6 |publisher=Bitchx.svn.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2011-07-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://bitchx.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bitchx?view=revision&revision=11 |title=SourceForge.net Repository - bitchx Revision 11 |publisher=Bitchx.svn.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2011-07-09[/tpl]
