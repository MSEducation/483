Think-aloud protocols involve participants thinking aloud as they are performing a set of specified tasks. Users are asked to say whatever they are looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling as they go about their task. This enables observers to see first-hand the process of task completion (rather than only its final product). Observers at such a test are asked to objectively take notes of everything that users say, without attempting to interpret their actions and words. Test sessions are often audio- and video-recorded so that developers can go back and refer to what participants did and how they reacted. The purpose of this method is to make explicit what is implicitly present in subjects who are able to perform a specific task.
A related but slightly different data-gathering method is the talk-aloud protocol. This involves participants only describing their action but not giving explanations. This method is thought to be more objective in that participants merely report how they go about completing a task rather than interpreting or justifying their actions (see the standard works by Ericsson & Simon).
As Kuusela and Paul [ref]
</ref> state the think-aloud protocol can be divided into two different experimental procedures. The first one is the concurrent think-aloud protocol, collected during the decision task. The second procedure is the retrospective think-aloud protocol, gathered after the decision task.
