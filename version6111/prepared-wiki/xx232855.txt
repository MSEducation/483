The Wade Point Light was a screw-pile lighthouse in North Carolina.

==History==

Lightship "M" was stationed at the mouth of the Pasquotank River off Albemarle Sound beginning in 1826. In 1855 it was replaced by a square screw-pile structure . This structure was eventually removed and replaced with the Pasquotank River Entrance Light, an automated tower about two miles NNE of the previous light.
