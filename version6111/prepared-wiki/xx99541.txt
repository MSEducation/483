==Overview==

The album contains fast and complex songs such as the title track and "Satch Boogie", which helped to further popularize shred guitar during that time, in addition to the stranger-sounding "Crushing Day" and "Lords of Karma". By contrast slower, melodic songs such as "Always with Me, Always with You" and "Echo" provide a change of pace. "Midnight" utilizes the technique of two-hand tapping at high tempo, evoking a Spanish fingerstyle effect. There are also Nashville-tuned guitars ("Echo") and key changes ("Always with Me, Always with You" and "Echo") to vary the album. "Ice 9" references the fictional apocalyptic substance from Kurt Vonnegut's 1963 novel Cat's Cradle.Surfing with the Alien liner notes (1999 remaster).

"Satch Boogie" is available as a playable track in Guitar Hero III's sequel Guitar Hero World Tour (2008), and as a bonus track in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades (2008). Additionally, both "Satch Boogie" and "Surfing with the Alien" are downloadable tracks for the Rock Band series.
