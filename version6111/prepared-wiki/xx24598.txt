The term pit bull is a generic term used to describe dogs with similar physical characteristics.  Usually a "pit bull" is considered one of several breeds including the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Bull Terrier, or any mix thereof. In some parts of the world, the American Bulldog and Dogo Argentino are also classified as a "Pit Bull-type" dog, despite major genetic differences. Any dog that is mixed with a "bully breed"[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Needs defintion or expansion of what a bully breed is|date=March 2014[/tpl] may also be called a "pit bull" including those that are descended from the English Bulldog, French Bulldog, Boston Terrier and Cane Corso.[tpl]cite web |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/umkc78&div=32&id=&page= |title=Irrationality Unleashed: The Pitfalls of Breed-Specific Legislation[/tpl]  The pit bull is not a distinct breed which may make it difficult for experts to identify,[tpl]cite web |url=http://nationalcanineresearchcouncil.com/breed-identification-1/ |title=Inaccuracy of Breed Labels Assigned to Dogs of Unknown Origin[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.animalsandsociety.org/assets/303_msbaspr10310rev.pdf |title=Breed Discriminatory Legislation: How DNA Will Remedy the Unfairness[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.maddiesfund.org/Documents/Resource%20Library/Incorrect%20Breed%20Identification%20Study%20Poster.pdf |title=Pit bull Identification in Animal Shelters[/tpl] and while mixed breed dogs are often labelled a "pit bull" if they have certain physical characteristics such as a square shaped head or bulky body type, visual identification of mixed breed dogs is not recommended by the scholarly community.

==History==

All pit bulls were created with similar cross-breeding between bulldogs and terriers, but each individual pit bull breed has a distinct history.

===Pit Bull Terrier===

The Pit Bull Terrier was created by breeding Old English Terriers and Old English Bulldogs together to produce a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/Breeds/AmericanPitBullTerrierRevisedNovember12008 |title=American Pit Bull Terrier |publisher=United Kennel Club (UKC) |date=November 1, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009[/tpl] These dogs were bred in England, and arrived in the United States where they became the direct ancestors of the American Pitbull Terrier. In the United Kingdom pit bulls were used in bloodsports such as bull baiting, bear baiting and cock fighting. These bloodsports were officially eliminated in 1835 as Britain began to introduce animal welfare laws. Since dogfights were cheaper to organise and far easier to conceal from the law than bull or bear baits, bloodsport proponents turned to pitting their dogs against each other instead. Dog fighting was used as both a bloodsport (often involving gambling) and a way to continue to test the quality of their stock. For decades afterwards, dog fighting clandestinely took place in small areas of Britain and America. In the early 20th century pitbulls were used as catch dogs in America for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, and drive livestock, and as family companions. Some have been selectively bred for their fighting prowess.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aspca.org/fight-cruelty/dog-fighting/pit-bull-cruelty |title=Pit Bull Cruelty |publisher=American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) |year=2013 |accessdate=February 3, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aspca.org/fight-cruelty/dog-fighting |title=Dog Fighting |publisher=American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) |year=2013 |accessdate=February 3, 2014[/tpl]

===Staffordshire Bull Terrier===

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier had its beginnings in the early 19th century by breeding bulldogs, mastiffs, and terriers together. The resulting offspring were originally known as the "bull and terrier dog", the "Pit Dog" and the "Pit Bull Terrier". The early bull terriers of the Elizabethan era were often used for bull baiting and with a weight of between 100 lbs (45 kg) and 120 lbs (54 kg) were significantly larger than the modern bull terrier.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.akc.org/breeds/staffordshire_bull_terrier/history.cfm|title= AKC Staffordshire Bull Terrier Breed History|accessdate= 2008-07-29|author=American Kennel Club|work= www.akc.org[/tpl] These dogs imported to America from England as early as 1870, where they were known as the Pit Dog, Pit Bull Terrier, and later American Bull Terrier or Yankee terrier.[tpl]cite web |title=American Staffordshire Terrier History |publisher=American Kennel Club |year=2009 |url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/american_staffordshire_terrier/history.cfm |accessdate=July 24, 2010[/tpl] They were imported primarily, but not exclusively, for pit fighting.[tpl]cite book |editor1-first=Ross D., DVM |editor1-last=Clark |editor2-first=Joan R. |editor2-last=Stainer |editor3-first=H.

The dog was officially recognised by the The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom as the "Staffordshire bull terrier" in 1935. Not long after, in 1936, they were recognised by the American Kennel Club (AKC) as "Staffordshire Terriers." Breeders started creating exemplars heavier in weight. Since January 1, 1972, the breed was renamed "American Staffordshire Terrier" to describe it as a separate breed from the lighter Staffordshire Bull Terrier of England.

==Attacks on humans==

===Studies===

A 9-year (1979–88) review of fatal dog attacks in the United States determined that, of the 101 attacks in which breed was recorded, pit bulls were implicated in 42 of those attacks (42%).[tpl]cite journal |last1=Sacks |first1=Jeffrey J. |last2=Sattin |first2=Richard W. |last3=Bonzo |first3=Sandra E. |year=1989 |title=Dog Bite-Related Fatalities from 1979 Through 1988 |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=55–57 |publisher=American Medical Association |doi= |url=http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/1979-1988-dog-bite-related-fatalities.pdf [/tpl] A 1991 study found that 94% of attacks on children by pit bulls were unprovoked, compared to 43% for other breeds.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Avner |first1=Jeffrey R. |last2=Baker |first2=M.

A 20-year (1979-1998) study by the American Veterinary Medical Association into fatal dog attacks on humans concluded that "fatal attacks on humans appear to be a breed-specific problem (pit bull-type dogs and Rottweilers)," and that "pit bull-type dogs and Rottweilers were involved in more than half" (67%) of all the 238 recorded dog bite-related fatalities (DBRF) in the United States during that period, with pit bulls accounting for 66 deaths.

A 5-year (2001–05) review of dog attack victims admitted to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia determined that pit bull terriers were implicated in more than half of the bites where breed was identified. Of the 269 patients where breed was identified, 137 (51%) were attacked by pit bulls.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Kaye |first1=Alison E. |last2=Belz |first2=Jessica M. |last3=Kirschner |first3=Richard E. |year=2009 |title=Pediatric Dog Bite Injuries: A 5-Year Review of the Experience at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=124 |issue=2 |pages=551–558 |publisher=American Society of Plastic Surgeons |doi=10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181addad9 [/tpl] The authors wrote:

Some other studies on the number of human deaths caused by dog bite trauma have surveyed news media stories for reports of dog-bite-related fatalities. This methodology is subject to potential errors, as some fatal attacks may not have been reported, a study might not find all relevant news reports, and the dog breed might be misidentified.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf |title=Breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks in the United States between 1979 and 1998 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=April 1, 2008 |accessdate=July 8, 2009[/tpl]

===Other studies===

A study by Raghaven in Canada, which showed that breed specific legislation limits the number of pitbulls, and where sled dogs and free roaming packs of dogs is more common than in the United States, an electronic search of newspaper articles found that pit bull terriers were responsible for 1 (4%) of 28 dog-bite-related fatalities reported in Canada from 1990–2007.[tpl]cite journal |first=Malathi |last=Raghavan |title=Fatal dog attacks in Canada, 1990–2007 |date = June 2008|periodical=The Canadian Veterinary Journal (La Revue vétérinaire canadienne) |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=577–581 |pmid=18624067 |pmc=2387261[/tpl]
The study also noted that:
In a project called the "Calgary Model," legislation addressing bad owners instead of breeds has been the focus. After implementation, which included fining the owner $350–$1,500 in dog bite cases, there was a 25-year low in the incidence of such cases.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Several studies determined that pit bull owners, and owners of other "vicious" or "high risk" breeds (most commonly identified as Akita, Chow Chow, Doberman Pinscher, Rottweiler, and Wolf-mix), are more likely to have criminal convictions and are more likely to display antisocial behaviors. A 2006 study compared owners of "high risk" dogs to owners of "low risk" dogs. "High risk" dogs included “vicious” dogs by breed (e.g., pit bulls) or “vicious” actions (e.g., any dog that had bitten, attacked, or killed a person or other animal).  The study determined that "high risk" dog owners had nearly 10 times as many criminal convictions than did "low risk" dog owners.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Barnes |first1=Jaclyn E. |last2=Boats |first2=Barbara W. |last3=Putnam |first3=Frank W. |last4=Dates |first4=Harold F. |last4=Mahlman |first4=Andrew R. |year=2006 |title=Ownership of High-Risk ("Vicious") Dogs as a Marker for Deviant Behaviors: Implications for Risk Assessment |journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=1616–1634 |publisher=Sage Publications |doi=10.1177/0886260506294241 [/tpl] A 2009 study[tpl]cite journal |last1=Ragatz |first1=Laurie |last2=Fremouw |first2=William |last3=Thomas |first3=Tracy |last4=Fremouw |first4=McCoy |last4=Katrina |year=2009 |title=Vicious Dogs: The Antisocial Behaviors and Psychological Characteristics of Owners |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=199–703 |publisher=American Academy of Forensic Sciences |doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2009.01001.x [/tpl] and a followup 2012 study generally supported these findings.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Schenk |first1=Allison M. |last2=Ragatz |first2=Laurie L. |last3=Fremouw |first3=William J. |year=2012 |title=Vicious Dogs Part 2: Criminal Thinking, Callousness, and Personality Styles of Their Owners |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=152–59 |publisher=American Academy of Forensic Sciences |doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2011.01961.x [/tpl]

==Socialization==

A Pit bull's genetic make up was developed so it would be a good fighting dog. However, this genetic disposition does not mean that all Pit bulls are aggressive or that they are prone to attacking other animals. Pit bulls require the same amount of socialization training as other dogs during puppy-hood, possibly more. Like any dog, a Pit bull that is well socialized is less likely to attack when it feels threatened. The Pit bull breed is known to be more “rough and tumble” during play time, but frequent socialization with other dogs can mean that a Pit bull pet goes into adulthood with a positive feeling towards other dogs.[tpl]cite web |author=ASPCA |title=The Truth About Pit Bulls |url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/dog-behavior/truth-about-pit-bulls[/tpl]

==Legislation==

Widely reported pit bull attacks have resulted in the enactment of breed-specific legislation in several jurisdictions.  The attacks have also led to increased premiums for liability insurance.
Many of the jurisdictions that restrict pit bulls apply their restriction to: (a) the modern American Pit Bull Terrier, (b)  American Staffordshire Terrier, (c) Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and (d) any other dog that has the substantial physical characteristics and appearance of those breeds.

All of the breeds share a similar history, with origins rooted from the bulldog and a variety of terriers, except for the Johnson line of American Bulldog (as opposed to the more pure Scott line), which come from the bulldog and a variety of mastiffs. The dogs called bull terriers before the development of the modern bull terrier in the early 20th century may also be called pit bulls.
Approximately 550 jurisdictions have enacted breed-specific legislation (BSL) in response to a number of well-publicised incidents involving pit bull-type dogs, and some government organizations such as the U.S. Army[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/13296614/US-Army-Bans-Pit-Bulls-and-Other-Breeds-from-All-RCI-Housing |title=Garrison Policy Memorandum #08-10, Mandatory Pet Micro-Chipping and Pet Control |publisher=US Army Installation Management Command, Fort Drum, NY |date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl] and Marine Corps[tpl]cite web |title=Marine Corps Housing Management |date=August 11, 2009 |publisher=United States Marine Corps |url=http://www.mcrdpi.usmc.mil/ops/housing/docs/PETPOLICY.pdf |accessdate=November 16, 2009[/tpl] have taken administrative action as well. These actions range from outright bans on the possession of pit bull-type dogs, to restrictions and conditions on pit bull ownership.  They often establish a legal presumption that a pit bull-type dog is prima facie a legally "dangerous" or "vicious" dog.[tpl]cite book |last=Palika |first=Liz |title=American Pit Bull Terrier: Your Happy Healthy Pet |publisher=Howell Book House |date=January 31, 2006 |isbn=978-0-471-74822-9 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=5eb20393tgsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=american+pit+bull+terrier&cd=1#v=onepage&q= |accessdate=March 1, 2010[/tpl] In response, 16 states in the U.S. prohibited or restricted the ability of municipal governments within those states to enact BSL, though these restrictions do not affect military installations located within the states.[tpl]cite web |publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association |title=States prohibiting or allowing breed specific ordinances |date = October 2007|url=http://www.avma.org/advocacy/state/issues/sr_breed_ordinances.asp |accessdate=July 12, 2009[/tpl]
It is now generally settled in caselaw that jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada have the right to enact breed-specific legislation.[tpl]cite journal |last=Campbell |first=Dana |title=Pit Bull Bans: The State of Breed–Specific Legislation |journal=GP-Solo |volume=26 |issue=5 |publisher=American Bar Association |date=July–August 2009 |url=http://www.abanet.org/genpractice/magazine/2009/jul_aug/pitbull.html |accessdate=July 30, 2009[/tpl] Despite these holdings by the courts, there is some public skepticism over whether the laws are effective.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pitbulls.org/article/why-breed-specific-legislation-misses-mark-and-doesnt-work |title=Why Breed Specific Legislation Misses the Mark and Doesn't Work |publisher=Pitbulls.org |year=2010 |accessdate=March 1, 2011[/tpl] One point of view is that pit bulls are a public safety issue that merits actions such as banning ownership, mandatory spay/neuter for all pit bulls, mandatory microchip implants and liability insurance, or prohibiting people convicted of a felony from owning pit bulls[tpl]cite news |last=Nelson |first=Kory |publication-date=August 2005 |title=One city's experience: why pit bulls are more dangerous and why breed-specific legislation is justified |periodical=Municipal Lawyer |volume=46 |issue=6 |year=2005 |pages=12–15 |url=http://www.dogbitelaw.com/pitbullDenver.pdf |accessdate=July 11, 2009[/tpl] Another point of view is that comprehensive "dog bite" legislation, coupled with better consumer education and legally mandating responsible pet-keeping practices, is a better solution to the problem of dangerous pit bulls than BSL.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/dangerous_dogs.html |title=HSUS Statement on Dangerous Dogs |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |year=2009 |accessdate=July 11, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=A community approach to dog bite prevention |periodical=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association |volume=218 |issue=11 |date=June 1, 2001 |pages=1731–1749 |url=http://www.avma.org/public_health/dogbite/dogbite.pdf |accessdate=July 11, 2009[/tpl]
A third point of view is that breed-specific legislation should not ban breeds entirely, but should instead strictly regulate the conditions under which specific breeds could be owned.  For example, forbidding certain classes of individuals from owning them, specifying public areas from which they would be prohibited, and establishing conditions, such as requiring a dog to wear a muzzle, for taking specific breeds of dogs into public places.[tpl]cite web |last=Phillips |first=Kenneth |title=Breed Specific Laws |publisher=dogbitelaw.com |date=October 10, 2008 |url=http://www.dogbitelaw.com/PAGES/breedlaws.html#arguments |accessdate=July 11, 2009[/tpl] Finally, some governments, such as in Australia, have forbidden the import of specific breeds, and are requiring the spay/neuter of all existing dogs of these breeds in an attempt to eliminate the breed's population slowly through natural attrition.[tpl]cite news |first=Karen |last=Barlow |title=NSW bans pit bull terrier breed |date=May 3, 2005 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |location=Sydney, Australia|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2005/s1359018.htm |accessdate=December 23, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Gary |last=Hughes |title=Pit bull bite prompts call for national approach to dangerous dog breeds |date=October 20, 2009 |newspaper=The Australian |place=Sydney, Australia |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/pit-bull-bite-prompts-call-for-national-approach-to-dangerous-dog-breeds/story-e6frg6of-1225788552051 |accessdate=December 23, 2009[/tpl]

In England and Wales the Dangerous Dogs Act prohibits the ownership of pit bull terrier along with 3 other breeds. The Act also bans the breeding, sale and exchange of these dogs.
In the Canadian province of Ontario, a pitbull ban was enacted in 2005, making it illegal to breed or import pitbull terriers, including the Staffordshire bull terrier, American Staffordshire terrier, American pitbull terrier, or any breed with “substantially similiar” physical characteristics.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]

===Liability insurance===

Dog owners in the United States can be held legally liable for injuries inflicted or caused by their dogs. In general, owners are considered liable if they were unreasonably careless in handling or restraining the dog, or if they knew beforehand that the dog had a tendency to cause injury (e.g., bite); however, dog owners are automatically considered liable if local laws hold an owner strictly liable for all damage caused by their dog, regardless of carelessness or foreknowledge of a dog's tendencies. Homeowners and renters insurance policies typically provide liability coverage from US$100,000–300,000 for injuries inflicted by dogs;[tpl]cite web |title=Dog Bite Liability |publisher=Insurance Information Institute |date=September 2009 |url=http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/dogbite/ |accessdate=September 24, 2009[/tpl] however, some insurance companies limit their exposure to dog bite liability claims by putting restrictions on dog owners that they insure. These restrictions include refusing to cover dog bites under the insurance policy; increasing insurance rates for homeowners with specific breeds; requiring owners of specific breeds to take special training or have their dogs pass the American Kennel Club Canine Good Citizen test;[tpl]cite web |title=Homeowners Insurance Available to Breeds Previously Excluded with CGC Certification |publisher=American Kennel Club |date=October 1, 2004 |url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=2408 |accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] requiring owners to restrict their dogs with muzzles, chains, or enclosures; and refusing to write policies for homeowners or renters who have specific breeds of dogs.
Owners of rental properties may also be held liable if they knew an aggressive dog was living on their property and they did nothing to ensure the safety of other tenants at the property; as a result, many rental properties forbid pit bull-type dogs and any other breeds if the rental property's insurance will not cover damage inflicted by that type of dog. The dog breeds most often targeted by insurance companies include pit bull-type dogs, Rottweilers, German Shepherd Dogs, Doberman Pinschers, Akitas (Akita Inu and American Akita), and Chows.[tpl]cite web |first=Brian |last=Sodergren |title=Insurance companies unfairly target specific dog breeds |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |url=http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/insurance_companies_unfairly_target_specific_dog_breeds.html |accessdate=August 12, 2009[/tpl]
In 2013, Farmers Insurance notified policy holders in California that "it will no longer cover bites by pit bulls, rottweilers and wolf hybrids. A spokeswoman for Farmers said those breeds account for more than a quarter of the agency's dog bite claims."Gephardt, Bill. Some dog breeds too risky for insurance companies. KSL.com, May 8th, 2013

===Air carrier restrictions===

Several air carriers embargo certain dog breeds, due to the effect of high temperature and humidity on brachycephalic animals, or concerns for the safety of airline property, personnel, and passengers. The following table has a sampling of air carrier embargoes on dogs.
United Airlines formerly embargoed American Pit Bull Terriers for safety reasons. However, pit bulls (along with American Staffordshires and other similar breeds) are now permitted, provided that dogs over six months old or weighing more than 20 pounds (9 kg) are transported in reinforced crates.[tpl]cite web |title= Pet restrictions |publisher=United Airlines |url=http://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/travel/animals/restrictions.aspx |accessdate=July 10, 2013[/tpl]

==Notable pit bulls==

Pit Bull breeds have become famous for their roles as soldiers, police dogs, search and rescue dogs, actors, television personalities, seeing eye dogs, and celebrity pets. Historically, the Bull Terrier mix Nipper and the American Staffordshire Terrier, Pete the Pup from the Little Rascals are the most well known.
