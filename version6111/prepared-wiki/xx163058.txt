[[Chamacoco language]]

CATEGORIES: Zamucoan languages, Languages of Paraguay

Chamacoco is a Zamucoan language spoken in Paraguay and maybe Brazil by the Chamacoco people. It is also known as Xamicoco or Xamacoco, although the tribe itself prefers the name  Ishír, which is also spelled Ishiro or Jewyo.Chamacoco: Orientation. Every Culture. 2008 (retrieved 29 March 2009) When the term Ishiro (or yshyro or ɨshɨro) is used to refer to the language, it is an abbreviation for Ishir(o) ahwoso, literally meaning 'the words, the language of the Chamacoco people'.

Its speakers are of all ages, and generally do not speak Spanish or Guarani well.Gordon, Raymond G., Jr., ed. Chamacoco: A Language of Paraguay. Ethnologue. 2005 (retrieved 29 March 2009)

==Classification==

Chamacoco is classified as a Zamucoan language, along with Ayoreo. Both languages are considered endangered.Sorosoro: Zamucoan family.  There is relatively little information about the Zamucoan family. 
Chamacoco speakers live in the northeastern part of the Chaco Boreal at the origin of the Río Verde in Paraguay. Four dialects of Chamacoco have been identified: Héiwo, in the Fuerte Olimpo area; Ebidóso and Hório, spoken in the Bahía Negra region; and Tomaráho, in the Paraná-Paraíba interior forests.
The speakers of Hório and Ebidóso were estimated to be 800 in 1970. less than 200 people spoke Tomaráho then. Back in 1930, over 2000 people were estimated to speak Chamacoco.
Verb inflection is based on personal prefixes, the language is tenseless.Ciucci, Luca 2009. Elementi di morfologia verbale del chamacoco. Quaderni del Laboratorio di Linguistica della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, n.s. 8. http://linguistica.sns.it/QLL/QLL09.htm For example, chɨpɨrme teu dosh means "the kingfisher eats fish", while chɨpɨra teu wichɨ dosht means "the kingfisher will eat fish." Nouns can be divided into possessable and non-possessable. Possessable nouns are characterized by a prefixation whereby the noun agrees with the possessor or genitival modifier.Ciucci, Luca 2010. La flessione possessiva del chamacoco. Quaderni del Laboratorio di Linguistica della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, n.s. 9,2. http://linguistica.sns.it/QLL/QLL10.htm There is no difference between nouns and adjectives in suffixation.Ciucci, Luca 2013. Chamacoco lexicographical supplement. Quaderni del Laboratorio di Linguistica della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, n.s. 12. http://linguistica.sns.it/QLL/QLL13.htm The syntaxis is characterized by the presence of para-hypotactical structures.
