</ref>  This made much more efficient use of its fuel than the older [[Newcomen engine]].  Initially the business was based at the [[Soho Manufactory]] near Boulton's [[Soho House]] on the southern edge of the then-rural parish of [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]].  However most of the components for their engines were made by others, for example the cylinders by [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]].
In 1795, they began to make steam engines themselves at their Soho Foundry in Smethwick, near Birmingham, England.  The partnership was passed to two of their sons in 1800.  William Murdoch was made a partner of the firm in 1810, where he remained until his retirement 20 years later at the age of 76.  The firm lasted over 120 years, and was still making steam engines in 1895; a few of those engines have been preserved.

==Nurturing talent==

The business was a hotbed for the nurturing of emerging engineering talent. Among the names which were employed there in the eighteenth century were James Law, Peter Ewart, William Brunton, Isaac Perrins, William Murdoch, and John Southern.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Transactions of the Newcomen Society |title=Steam and the engineering community in the eighteenth century |author=Buchanan, R.

==Archive==

The firm left an extremely detailed archive of its activities, which was given to the city of Birmingham in 1911 and is kept at the Library of Birmingham. The library has since obtained various other related archives.
