==Member of Parliament==

Blincoe was first elected to Parliament in the 1990 elections as MP for Nelson, replacing the outgoing Philip Woollaston. He was re-elected in the 1993 elections, but in the 1996 elections, the seat of Nelson was expanded into rural areas formerly part of the Tasman electorate. Blincoe was defeated by the incumbent Tasman MP, Nick Smith of the National Party.

===1999 election===

In the 1999 election, Blincoe missed out on a seat, as a list candidate under MMP, by a narrow margin once special votes had been counted. Initially it appeared that Blincoe would have a seat in Parliament, as well as a party member directly following him on the Labour party's list. With the counting of special votes, however, the Green Party crossed the minimum 5% threshold of votes and received an electorate MP, which in turn allowed them to have seats in Parliament.  In addition, Winston Peters won the constituency seat of Tauranga by a narrow margin of sixty-two votes over a National Party candidate, and this enabled his New Zealand First party to acquire extra list seats in Parliament.
Once seats had been proportionally re-allocated with both the Green Party and New Zealand First in mind, fewer list seats were available for other parties, and consequently John Blincoe was not allocated a seat.
