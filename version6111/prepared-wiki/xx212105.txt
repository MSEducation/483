===Growth===

Growth by conversion had been sporadic but accelerating by the end of the 1970s. In the 1970s a number of gatherings of Bahá'ís resulted in teams of people who cooperated in efforts to bring the religion to the attention of people in New Caledonia.[tpl]cite journal | title = Around the World; Teaching follows| journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1976 | page = 13 | url = | issue = 542[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title = Around the World; South West Pacific; Local Assembly result of teaching efforts| journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1977 | page = 16 | url = | issue = 552[/tpl] In one nine-week period in early 1977 29 people converted to the religion; 12 being from the town of Thio alone, and three more are from the Loyalty Islands.[tpl]cite journal | title = Around the World; South West Pacific; Faith grows by 15 per cent| journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1977 | page = 12 | url = | issue = 555[/tpl] In 1978 Meherangiz Munsiff, a Bahá'í from Great Britain, attracted publicity. In Nouméa, Munsiff participated in a one and one-half-hour television broadcast mentioning Bahá'í teachings on the role of women which was transmitted to many places in the South Pacific.[tpl]cite journal | title = Around the World; South West Pacific; Teacher attracts interest| journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1978 | page = 13 | url = | issue = 566[/tpl] In 1979 Bahá'ís sources state there were seven assemblies and 24 additional localities with at least one Bahá'í, plus six assemblies and 24 localities of at least one Bahá'í in the Loyalty Islands.[tpl]cite journal | title = Around the World; South West Pacific| journal = Bahá'í News |date=August 1979 | page = 10 | issn=0043-8804 | url = | issue = 581[/tpl]
In the 1980s larger group dynamics began to come into play. In 1982 Bahá'ís in the Loyalty Islands from Maré Island built a Bahá'í center for the Bahá'ís of Nakéty of Canala province of the main island, in a traditional style – at the dedication some 100 non-Bahá'ís and village elders were moved by the act of service from one community to another.[tpl]cite journal | title = Around the World; New Caledonia| journal = Bahá'í News |date=September 1982 | page = 13 | issn=0195-9212 | url = | issue = 618[/tpl] In 1986 tribal chiefs accepted news of the religion with enthusiasm when they understood that progressive revelation from a Bahá'í point of view neither negated nor condemned previous religions, and indeed their own tribal faith predicted the coming of a great "Peacemaker."[tpl]cite journal | title = 'Promise' given to 168 heads of state| journal = Bahá'í News |date=August 1986 | page =  4 | issn=0195-9212 | url = | issue = 665[/tpl]
In 1990 in classes by Helen Perkins, a Bahá'í from Australia, aspects of the religion were emphasized as well as giving a chance to respond to questions of Bahá'ís. She also spoke at a large gathering.[tpl]cite journal | title = The World; Australasia| journal = Bahá'í News |date=August 1990 | page = 11 | issn=0195-9212 | url = | issue = 712[/tpl]

==Demographics==

A 2001 estimate for the number of Bahá'ís in the countrly was listed at 0.50% of the national population or 1,070 individuals with an annual growth rate of +2.1% by Operation World. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 880 Bahá'ís in 2005.[tpl]cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists > Compare Nations > Religions > | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-07-04[/tpl] The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 955 Bahá'ís in 2005.
