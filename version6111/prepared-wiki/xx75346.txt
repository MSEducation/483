Sir John Morison Gibson, KCMG, KC (January 1, 1842 – June 3, 1929) was a Canadian politician and the tenth Lieutenant Governor of Ontario.
John Morison Gibson, the son of Scottish immigrants, was born in 1842, in Toronto. He grew up on a farm in Caledonia, Ontario, went to Hamilton Central School, in Hamilton, and went on to be educated at the University of Toronto, as a lawyer. In 1860 he joined the university company of the 2nd Battalion Volunteer Militia The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada and was a Wimbledon marksman in 1874. He became a company director and developed a keen interest in music and art. On his return to Hamilton in 1864, he enlisted in the 13th Battalion as an ensign.In 1866, he was a lieutenant in the 13th Battalion, and fought at the Battle of Ridgeway, defending against the Fenian raids. He rose through the ranks of the 13th Battalion and was Commanding Officer from 1886 to 1895 (see regimental history Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment)). He was a Member of the Legislature from 1879 to 1905 and held the posts of Provincial Secretary, Commissioner of Crown Lands and Attorney General of Ontario. Gibson was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario in 1908,[tpl]cite web| title = Fast Facts from Hamilton's Past| url=http://www.myhamilton.ca/myhamilton/LibraryServices/Localhistory/Fast+Facts.htm| accessdate = 2007-01-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060905060213/http://www.myhamilton.ca/myhamilton/LibraryServices/Localhistory/Fast+Facts.htm  |archivedate = 2006-09-05[/tpl] and was knighted in 1912. During his mandate, the new Government House in Chorley Park (now demolished) was completed. Gibson served as Lieutenant Governor until 1914. He was one of Hamilton's "5 Johns", who, in 1896, formed the Dominion Power and Transmission Company, that brought hydroelectric power, for the first time, to Hamilton, from their plant, at DeCew Falls.[tpl]cite book|title=Dictionary of Hamilton Biography (Vol II, 1876-1924)|first=Thomas Melville |last=Bailey|publisher=W.L.

"One big reason" for almost 75% increase in the population of Hamilton between 1901 and 1912, boasted Sir John Morison Gibson of Dominion Power and Transmission Company, was "Cheap Electric Power Furnished By Us." This simplistic explanation for the development of Hamilton in the early twentieth century leaves much unexamined, but one conclusion cannot be disputed. In the perception of the Hamilton public, a view certainly fostered by Gibson and his fellow hydroelectric promoters, Hamilton was no longer regarded the Birmingham or the Pittsburgh of Canada Hamilton was now, as the title of a 1906 promotional booklet on the city proudly proclaimed, "The Electric City."

After receiving a grant from Andrew Carnegie of New York the city of Hamilton built a brand new Library on the south side of Main Street West, across the street from the old Library. It was officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor Sir John Morison Gibson on May 5, 1913.[tpl]cite web| title = Hamilton's Public Library History|url=http://www.myhamilton.ca/articles/hamilton-public-library-history| accessdate = 2012-06-15[/tpl] He was active in many charities, especially the Red Cross and child welfare. He died in Hamilton, Ontario in 1929.
