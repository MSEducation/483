On publication, its authors said the report: "sets out our recommendations for how the service should change in the future to meet the demands of the twenty-first century."Foreword: Independent Review of The Fire Service, online report, published 16 Dec 2002, (accessed 18 Oct 2005) The report prompted a prolonged period of industrial action in the UK by firefighters, the first national strike since 1977.  The Bain report made several recommendations, that led to wide ranging changes in the approach to fire and rescue authorities (FRS) in the UK.  It was controversial because of its extensive scope, and in 2006, many changes to UK FRS continue as a direct result of it.
