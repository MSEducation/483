Even Stevens is an American comedy television series that aired on Disney Channel with a total of three seasons and 65 episodes from June 17, 2000, to June 13, 2003. It follows the life of the Stevenses, a Jewish family living in suburban Sacramento, California, mainly focusing on the clashing personalities of its two younger siblings, Ren and Louis.
The series was produced by Brookwell McNamara Entertainment and Fireworks Entertainment. It is often cited as launching Shia LaBeouf's breakout career as an actor. The show features a fast motion photography, which features in every episode.
The feature-length Disney Channel Original Movie based on the series, The Even Stevens Movie, premiered on June 13, 2003, and serves as the series finale.
As of January 15, 2010, in America, Even Stevens has been removed from television syndication altogether, though The Even Stevens Movie continues to air on Disney Channel and Teen Nick, and on Family Channel occasionally.

==Production==

The show was originally produced as a show called "Spivey's Kid Brother". A pilot was filmed in late 1997, and was later picked up by Disney Channel as "Even Stevens". In the first episode Disney had to dub out the name "Spivey" to "Stevens". In fact, in the gym class scene, a banner is visible in the background reading, "Home of Spivey and the Wild Wombats."
In the theme song of the show, clay animations of Louis and Ren turn their remote controls into lightsabers, alluding to Star Wars. Prior to this, Ren reads a TV Guide with live-action photos of Christy Carlson Romano and Shia LaBeouf on the cover.
Although the show lasted three seasons, the timeline of the show is only one school year, since Louis and his friends remain in the 7th grade and Ren and her friends remain in the 8th grade. Ren finally graduates in The Even Stevens Movie.
