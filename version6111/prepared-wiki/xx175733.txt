John M. Granville (September 25, 1974 â€“ January 1, 2008) was an American diplomat who worked in South Sudan.  On January 1, 2008, he was assassinated in a shooting in Khartoum, Sudan at the age of 33.

==Career==

Granville grew up in Buffalo, New York.  He was a graduate Canisius High School in 1993 and of Fordham University.  In 2003, he graduated from Clark University with a Master of Arts degree in International Development and Social Change.  He studied as a Fulbright Fellow in Africa.  After school, Granville joined the Peace Corps and was sent to Cameroon for two years.
As a diplomat, Granville worked for the United States Agency for International Development in Kenya and Sudan.  In his current assignment, he led a project to provide residents in South Sudan with 75,000 radios that could be powered by a crank generator or solar panels. The project was part of the preparations for the upcoming 2009 elections in South Sudan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wlid.usaid.gov/activities.html|title=Current Democracy Fellows|publisher=USAID|accessdate=2008-01-02[/tpl]
"He told his mom several times ... that it's dangerous, what he's doing, but he wouldn't want to be doing anything else," said U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins, who spoke with Granville's mother, Jane Granville, after her son's death.[tpl]cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g1ancTu5BeKFzzIvwiesxv1Q_ztwD8TTDQQ80|title=Slain Diplomat Was Devoted to Africa|publisher=Associated Press|date=January 2, 2008|accessdate=2008-01-02|first=Carolyn|last=Thompson[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl]

==Attack==

On January 1, 2008, Granville was attacked by gunmen while being driven home from a New Year's Eve party at the British Embassy in Khartoum.  According to Sudanese officials, Granville was ambushed by two gunmen who stopped their car in front of his.  His driver, Abdel Rahman Abbas, was killed immediately.  Another gunman shot Granville in the neck and chest.  He died a few hours later, after being taken to a hospital. 
Ali Sadiq, a spokesman for Sudan's Foreign Ministry, has stated, "We do not know why this happened.  All options are possible."  However, other Sudanese officials stated that gun crime is unusual in Khartoum. The United States State Department refused to comment because their investigation was in progress.  The attack followed a warning by the United Nations that a terrorist cell in Sudan was planning to attack foreigners.
