==History==

Ciudad Kennedy formed part of the land settled by Muisca people as far back as 6th century BC, and its historic name is Techotyba. The Spanish, through the Conquest of 1537, utilized this land area for farms and cattle ranches. The 20th century brought about further transformation, with urbanization starting in the 1930s. In 1948, Bavaria opened its main brewery in Kennedy.
In 1961, an urbanization project was undertaken, financed in part by the Alianza para el Progreso (Alliance for Progress). The locality was known as Ciudad Techo until 1963, when the name was changed in honor of the assassinated  John F. Kennedy, who visited Bogotá in 1961 and supported the Alliance for Progress.

==Economy==

The western and southern parts of the locality are developed as commercial and industrial zones, including the Bavaria brewery. There is also a radio station (Emisora Kennedy), a location of the SENA technical school, and various shopping areas.
