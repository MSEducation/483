[[Sowy River]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Somerset, Somerset Levels, Drainage canals

The Sowy River is an artificial drainage channel in Somerset, England.
It is a [tpl]convert|7.5|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] embanked channel which starts at Monks Leaze clyce below Langport, and carries excess water from the River Parrett to the King's Sedgemoor Drain, from where it flows to the estuary by gravity, rejoining the Parrett near Dunball wharf. Construction of the channel, together with improvements to the King's Sedgemoor Drain and the rebuilding of the clyce at Dunball, to create a fresh water seal which prevents salt water entering the drain from the river, cost £1.4 million, and was completed in 1972.[tpl]cite book|last=Otter|first=R.

During 2009 and 2010 work was undertaken to upgrade sluice gates, watercourses and culverts to enable seasonal flooding of Southlake Moor during the winter diverting water from the Sowy River onto the moor. It has the capacity to hold 1.2 million cubic metres as part of a scheme by the Parrett Internal Drainage Board to restore ten floodplains in Somerset. In spring the water is drained away to enable the land to be used as pasture during the summer.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/somerset/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_9364000/9364140.stm | title=Southlake Moor restored to floodplain by drainage board | publisher=BBC | accessdate=19 January 2011 | date=17 January 2011[/tpl] The scheme is also used to encourage water birds.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.somersetdrainageboards.gov.uk/Southlake_FC_IDB_newsletter_2_Autumn_2010.pdf | title=Southlake Moor Favourable Condition Project Newsletter 2: Autumn 2010 | publisher=Parrett Drainage Board | accessdate=19 January 2011[/tpl]
