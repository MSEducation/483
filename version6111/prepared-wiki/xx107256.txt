BAE Systems Avionics was the avionics unit of BAE Systems until 2005, at which time it was transferred to SELEX Sensors and Airborne Systems S.p.A (initially 75% Finmeccanica and 25% BAE Systems, but since March 2007 fully owned by Finmeccanica) and was renamed SELEX Sensors and Airborne Systems Limited. The business was headquartered in Basildon, Essex, England.

==History==

BAE Systems Avionics has a rich heritage which dates back to 1909 when the Elliot and Marconi companies began to fit aircraft with systems (beginning with embryonic air to ground communications). By 1913 Elliot's avionics product lines advanced to gyroscopes, weapon sights and altimeters.
