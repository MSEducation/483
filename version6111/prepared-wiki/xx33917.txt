Thomas James "Tom" Vilsack ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|l|s|æ|k[/tpl]; born December 13, 1950) is an American politician who has served as the United States Secretary of Agriculture since 2009. A member of the Democratic Party, Vilsack served as the 40th Governor of Iowa from 1999 to 2007.
On November 30, 2006, he formally launched his candidacy for the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2008 election, but ended his bid on February 23, 2007.Vilsack Dropping Out Boston Globe, February 23, 2007
Barack Obama announced Vilsack's selection to be Secretary of Agriculture under his administration on December 17, 2008. Vilsack's nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous consent on January 20, 2009.

==Early life, education and career==

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Tom Vilsack was placed in a Roman Catholic orphanage. He was adopted in 1951 by Bud and Dolly Vilsack. Bud Vilsack was a real-estate agent and insurance salesman, and Dolly was a homemaker.
Vilsack attended Shady Side Academy, a preparatory high school in Pittsburgh. He received a bachelor's degree in 1972 from Hamilton College in New York. While at Hamilton he joined the Delta Upsilon Fraternity. He received a Juris Doctor (J.D.) in 1975 from Albany Law School. He and his wife settled in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, in 1975.

==Early political career==

Vilsack was elected mayor of Mount Pleasant in 1987. He was elected to the Iowa Senate in 1992. Following his election, he worked on legislation requiring companies who received state tax incentives to provide better pay and benefits. He helped pass a law for workers to receive health coverage when changing jobs, and helped re-design Iowa's Workforce Development Department. He also wrote a bill to have the State of Iowa assume a 50% share of local county mental health costs.

==Governor of Iowa==

In 1998, Terry Branstad chose not to seek re-election following sixteen consecutive years as governor. The Iowa Republican Party nominated Jim Ross Lightfoot, a recent former US Representative. Lightfoot became the odds-on favorite to succeed Branstad. Vilsack defeated former Iowa Supreme Court Justice Mark McCormick in the Democratic primary. Vilsack chose Sally Pederson as his running mate. Vilsack narrowly won the general election and became the first Democrat to serve as governor of Iowa in 30 years and only the fifth Democrat to hold the office in the 20th century.
In 2002 he won his second term in office by defeating Republican challenger attorney Doug Gross by eight points. 
The first year of his second term saw creation of the Grow Iowa Values Fund, a $503 million appropriation designed to boost the Iowa economy by offering grants to corporations and initiatives pledged to create higher-income jobs. Vilsack used a line-item veto, later ruled unconstitutional by the Iowa Supreme Court, to pass the fund, vetoing portions of the bill that would have cut income taxes and eased business regulations. After a special session of the Iowa General Assembly on September 7, 2004, $100 million in state money was set aside to honor previously made commitments. The Grow Iowa Values Fund was reinstated at the end of the 2005 session: under the current law, $50 million per year will be set aside over the next ten years.
Candidates seeking to replace Vilsack, most notably Des Moines politician Ed Fallon, criticized this program.http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050818/NEWS09/508180401[tpl]Dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] Their complaints include the fact that companies lured into Iowa by the fund, unlike Iowa-based corporations, can be lured away by greater cash incentives elsewhere. Another criticism is that it does nothing to promote new business.http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050924/BUSINESS04/509240325/1029/archive[tpl]Dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]
In July 2005, Vilsack signed an executive order allowing all felons who had served their sentences to vote again. Iowa law previously held that convicted felons are permanently disenfranchized unless voting rights were restored personally by the governor; Vilsack did away with this process.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/Custom/PAT_Current/print/2005-07leadstory1.html |title=Iowa Joins Ranks of States to Restore Voting Rights to Felons |publisher=Aspanet.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl] For most of Vilsack's tenure as Governor, Republicans held effective majorities in the Iowa General Assembly. Following the November 2, 2004, elections, the fifty-member Senate was evenly split between Democrats and Republicans and Republicans held a 51–49 majority in the House of Representatives.
During the 2005 legislative session, Vilsack signed into law greater restrictions that require products containing the active ingredient pseudoephedrine to be sold behind pharmacy counters, as opposed to open-access at open-shelf level. Those wishing to buy such products must show identification and sign a log book. The new law, designed to reduce methamphetamine use in Iowa, took effect on May 21, 2005. 
Following Kelo v. City of New London, Vilsack vetoed but was overridden on Iowa House file 2351, a bill to restrict Iowa's use of eminent domain.
Vilsack is a former member of the National Governors Association Executive Committee. He was chair of the Democratic Governors Association in 2004. He was also chair of the Governors Biotechnology Partnership, the Governors Ethanol Coalition, and the Midwest Governors Conference, and has also been chair and vice chair of the National Governors Association's committee on Natural Resources, where he worked to develop the NGA's farm and energy policies.[tpl]cite web|last=Longley|first=Robert|title=Tom Vilsack: Secretary of Agriculture|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/thepresidentandcabinet/a/tom_vilsack.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=September 5, 2012[/tpl]
Prior to Democratic Presidential candidate Senator John Kerry's selection of Senator John Edwards, Vilsack was thought to be high on the list of potential running mates for Kerry in the 2004 presidential election. In 2005, Vilsack established Heartland PAC, a political action committee aimed at electing Democratic Governors. In the first report, he raised over half a million dollars. Vilsack left office in 2007; he did not seek a third term and was succeeded by Chet Culver.

==2008 U.S. presidential campaign==

On November 30, 2006, Tom Vilsack became the second Democrat (after Mike Gravel) to officially announce intentions to run for the presidency in the 2008 election. In his announcement speech, he said "America's a great country, and now I have the opportunity to begin the process, the legal process of filing papers to run for President of the United States." Vilsack dropped out of the race on February 23, 2007 citing monetary constraints.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tomvilsack08.com/blog/archives/thank_you_video |title=Thank You Video |publisher=Tomvilsack08.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl]

===Views on Iraq===

Vilsack's stance on the war was critical of President Bush but hesitant to call for an immediate and complete pullout from Iraq: "I don't think we're losing in Iraq, It appears to be a draw. People are upset by the fact that their kids are over there and there doesn’t seem to be any end to this whole process. It’s not pacifism that makes people think this way. They’re questioning the credibility and competence of the Commander-in-Chief."[tpl]cite web|last=Goldberg |first=Jeffrey |url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060529fa_fact2 |title=New Yorker |publisher=New Yorker |date=2006-05-29 |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl]
On December 5, Vilsack announced that he favored withdrawing most of the U.S. forces from Iraq and leaving a small force in the northern region for a limited period. While acknowledging that a withdrawal would lead to more violence, he felt that it would be the only way for the Iraqi government to take control of their country.Vilsack wants smaller U.S. force in Iraq[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]

===Views on energy security===

The Vilsack Energy Security Agenda set out a strategy to dramatically reduce U.S. reliance on foreign energy and to cut the United States' carbon emissions. It also called for replacing the Department of Energy with a new Department of Energy Security, to oversee and redefine the federal government’s role in energy policy. The reorganized department would have acted as an institutional advocate for innovation in energy policy, and was intended to ensure accountability as the nation works towards achieving its energy security goals. Through this new department, America’s overriding objective in energy policy would have been to make America the unquestioned leader in clean energy, enhancing national security and economic strength.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.TomVilsack08.com |title=Tom Vilsack for President |publisher=Tomvilsack08.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl]
In a 2007 lecture to the Commonwealth Club of California, Vilsack stated,
[tpl]cquote|Iowa is one of the nation's leading producers of corn-based ethanol, and many people in my state have an economic stake in the expanded use of corn-based ethanol. But the reality is that corn-based ethanol will never be enough to reach our goals. Some have suggested that we import more sugar-based ethanol from Brazil and we should indeed consider all sources of available ethanol...but if we are going to create energy security we can't simply replace one imported source of energy with another. That alone is not security...the only way we can produce enough domestically is if we greatly improve the technology used to produce cellulosic ethanol.Emma Marris &  Alexandra Witze.

Vilsack approved a 15-cent per tree tax on Christmas tree sellers, as a result of over 3-years of lobbying from the Christmas tree industry.
