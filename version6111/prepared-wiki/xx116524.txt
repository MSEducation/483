Curling was re-added as a demonstration event in 1988 because the Olympics were being held in Calgary, Canada, where the sport has a strong following.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.fieldday.com/cbc/olympics/sports/curling/history/index.html|title=Curling History|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2010-03-08[/tpl] In November 1992, the Nagano Winter Olympic Organizing Committee and IOC Coordination Committee reached an agreement to include curling in the official programme of the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DF1431F93AA15752C1A964958260|title=An Agreement By Nagano Games|date=1992-11-29|accessdate=2010-03-08|work=The New York Times[/tpl] Both the men's and women's tournaments have been held at every Winter Olympics since.
