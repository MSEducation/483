Swayed by the Autobot's attitude, the Decepticon Headmaster Juniors rebelled against their former leader. Although Wilder and Bullhorn didn't immediately join the Autobots, they were soon aiding their former enemies in battle against the Decepticon forces "Battle to the Death!! God Ginrai VS Darkwings Reborn" at the Transformers Wiki only for Devil Z to remove their headmaster abilities, and turn their transtectors into independent beings. After Devil Z was killed by God Ginrai the fully robotic Wilder was last seen retreating into space under Overlord's command."Autobots! Desperate Attack!!" at the Transformers Wiki
