Mario Moises Alvarez is a Mexican professor and researcher at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies (Tec de Monterrey), specializing in pharmaceutical biochemical engineering. His work has been recognized by Level III membership in Mexico's Sistema Nacional de Investigadores and two granted US patents.
Alvarez’s mother was a teacher who insisted that her son attended the Tec de Monterrey starting with high school, which he did at the Ciudad Juárez campus. This was followed by undergraduate study in biochemical engineering at the Guaymas campus and a masters in the same field at the Monterrey campus .[tpl] cite web |url=http://www.itesm.edu/wps/wcm/connect/snc/portal+informativo/por+tema/educacion/70anostecdemonterrey068_22may13 |title= Mario Moisés Álvarez: un alumno becado que hoy diseña y crea biofármacos |date=May 22, 2013 |publisher=Tec de Monterrey  |accessdate=August 10, 2013 [/tpl] He continued his education studying a masters and doctorate in chemical and biochemical engineering at Rutgers University and post-doctoral work at Bristol Myers Squibb in the United States.[tpl] cite web |url=http://www.mty.itesm.mx/dia/deptos/iq/c_moises.htm |title= Mario Moisés Álvarez |publisher=Tec de Monterrey  |accessdate=August 10, 2013 [/tpl]
Since then, Alvarez has primarily been a researcher, known for being the director of the Centro de Biotecnología FEMSA (FEMSA Center for Biotechnology), a pharmaceutical engineering research group in the city of Monterrey, which he founded. The center develops pharmaceutical products using processes such as the genetic engineering of cells and is one of the most productive research organizations of the Tec de Monterrey system. Its activities have included the creation of a way to mass-produce a vaccine against the AH1N1 virus during the 2009 outbreak .[tpl] cite news |author=David Carrizales  |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/10/20/ciencias/a03n1cie |title= El ITESM desarrolla vacuna contra la influenza A/H1N1  |publisher=La Jornada |date= October 20, 2009 |page=3  |accessdate=August 10, 2013 [/tpl] More recent activities include the development of treatments for cancer, diabetes and high cholesterol from plants common in Mexico such as the black bean, the seed of the ebony tree and native strains of corn. The center has a staff of about one hundred scientists, mostly from Latin America and attracts students from Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, the United States, Panama and Venezuela.[tpl] cite news |url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/notas/2008/350185.html|title= Descubren en el ITESM propiedades anticancerígenas de plantas mexicanas |publisher=Crónica |date= February 11, 2013 |accessdate=August 10, 2013 [/tpl]
Alvarez's personal research specialties include design of bio-reactors, transport phenomena and mathematical modeling of biological systems, publishing more than 50 articles in prestigious international journals in his field, along with presenting in over fifty international forums and conferences.  He directs theses at the doctorate and masters level.
Alvarez's research work has been recognized by the Mexican government with Level III membership in the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores and also has a patent in process.[tpl]cite web |title=Investigadores vigentes a enero de 2013 |publisher=CONACYT |location=Mexico |url=http://www.conacyt.gob.mx/SNI/SNI_IntegrantesComisiones/Documents/PUBLICACION_vigentes_enero_2013.pdf |accessdate=August 7, 2013 [/tpl]
