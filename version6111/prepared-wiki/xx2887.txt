Reznor felt that the finished product he delivered to Interscope was complete and faithful to his vision and thought its commercial potential was limited, but after its release he was surprised by the success and received questions about a follow-up single with a music video to be shown on MTV.[tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=129–130[/tpl] The album has since sold over four million copies worldwide.<ref>

Many music critics and audiences praised The Downward Spiral for its abrasive, eclectic nature and dark themes and commented on the concept of a destruction of a man. The New York Times writer Jon Pareles' review of the album found the music to be highly abrasive. Pareles asserted that unlike other electro-industrial groups like Ministry and Nitzer Ebb, "Reznor writes full-fledged tunes" with stronger use of melodies than riffs. He noticed criticisms of Nine Inch Nails from industrial purists for popularizing the genre and the album's transgression.[tpl]cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 8, 1994 |first=Jon |last=Pareles |author-link=Jon Pareles |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904EFDC1130F93BA35756C0A962958260 |title=A Noise Sculptor Reveals An Ear for the Commercial |accessdate=November 26, 2007[/tpl] Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention ([tpl]Rating-Christgau|hm2[/tpl]) rating and commented that, musically, the album was comparable to "Heironymus Bosch as postindustrial atheist", but lyrically more closely resembled "Transformers as kiddie porn."[tpl]cite web| author-link=Robert Christgau | url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Nine+Inch+Nails | title=Consumer Guide: The Downward Spiral | journal=The Village Voice | date=February 21, 1995 | archiveurl=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv395-95.php | archivedate=August 29, 2009[/tpl] Jonathan Gold, writing for Rolling Stone, likened the album to cyberpunk fiction.[tpl]cite news |newspaper=Rolling Stone |publisher=Wenner Media |issue=678 |date=August 1, 1997 |page=92 |first=Jonathan |last=Gold |title=The Downward Spiral |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-downward-spiral-19970801 |accessdate=March 26, 2012[/tpl] Entertainment Weekly reviewer Tom Sinclair commented: "Reznor's pet topics (sex, power, S&M, hatred, transcendence) are all here, wrapped in hooks that hit your psyche with the force of a blowtorch."

==Legacy==

The immediate success of The Downward Spiral established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s. The band's image and musical style became highly recognizable that a Gatorade commercial featured a remix of "Down in It" without its involvement. Reznor felt uncomfortable with the media hype and success the band earned, received false reports of his death, depression, and relationship with mass murderer Jeffrey Dahmer, and was depicted as a sex icon due to his visual identity.[tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=165–180[/tpl] Nine Inch Nails received several honors, including Grammy Award nominations for Best Alternative Performance for The Downward Spiral and Best Rock Song for "Hurt".[tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=207[/tpl] After the release of The Downward Spiral, many bands such as Gravity Kills, Stabbing Westward, Filter, Mötley Crüe, and Skinny Puppy made albums that imitated the sound of Nine Inch Nails.[tpl]cite news |newspaper=Rolling Stone |publisher=Wenner Media |issue=763 |date=June 26, 1997 | first=Jon |last=Wiederhorn |title=Generation Swine |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/generation-swine-19970626 |accessdate=March 8, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r231887|pure_url=yes[/tpl] | title=The Process Review | author=Huey, Steve | work=allmusic.com | publisher=Rovi Corporation | accessdate=March 27, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1668716/the-downward-spiral-turns-20/franchises/the-anniversary|title=The Downward Spiral turns 20|author=Tom Breihan|work=Stereogum|date=March 7, 2014|accessdate=March 27, 2014[/tpl]
Reznor interpreted The Downward Spiral as an extension of himself that "became the truth fulfilling itself," as he experienced personal and social issues presented in the album after its release. He had already struggled with social anxiety disorder and depression and started his abuse of narcotics including cocaine while he went on an alcohol binge. Around this time, his studio perfectionism,[ref]
