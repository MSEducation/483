==Career==

In the early and mid 1930s, she wrote a weekly column for The New York World-Telegram.Fleur Fenton, "New Trend in Furniture Explained", The New York World-Telegram, December 4, 1933 In 1937, she became co-founder and executive vice president of the advertising agency Pettingell & Fenton Inc, which later became known as Hartman & Pettingell Inc, then again as Pettingell & Fenton, and finally as Dorland International-Pettingell Fenton Inc."Advertising News and Notes", The New York Times, January 7, 1937
She founded it with her second husband, Atherton Pettingell, a former executive vice president of Blacker Advertising. Among its clients were A. S. Beck, the shoe concern, Helena Rubenstein, the cosmetics company, and Cohama Fabrics."Advertising News and Notes", The New York Times, November 30, 1938 She resigned from the firm in 1946."Advertising News and Notes", The New York Times, September 6, 1946
Describing herself as "rough, uncut, and vigorous" as her trademark Russian emerald ring, she told Time, "I've worked hard, and I've made a fortune, and I did it in a man's world, but always, ruthlessly, and with a kind of cruel insistence, I have tried to keep feminine".http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888638,00.html"Fleur's Flair", Time, September 12, 1949 In 1950 she was lampooned by the writer S. J. Perelman in The New Yorker as glamorous editor "Hyacinth Beddoes Laffoon".S. J. Perelman, "The Hand That Cradles the Rock", The New Yorker, July 1, 1950
In 1947, she became an associate editor at Look magazine, and a year later, an associate editor at Quick magazine. She resigned her position at Look in November 1955 upon her separation from Gardner Cowles and moved to Europe, where she served as the magazine's foreign editorial consultant."Fleur Cowles to Quit", The New York Times, 19 October 1955 Before founding Flair, Cowles was a special consultant to the Famine Emergency Committee in Washington, D.C.
Cowles founded Flair magazine in 1950, and it folded a year later. The magazine, which Time described at its launch as "a fancy bouillabaisse of Vogue, Town & Country, Holiday, etc.," was celebrated not only because of its design and editorial production by European art director Federico Pallavicini (né Federico von Berzeviczy-Pallavicini)Federico Pallavicini obituary
but also because of its lavish production. It was the resulting cost of production that killed the magazine, since the expensive special costs (for cover cut-outs for some issues, for example) could not be supported in the long run. This magazine is now sought after by collectors and sells for significant amounts on eBay. Contributors included Saul Steinberg, Salvador Dalí (The Gypsy Angels Of Spain), and many writers and artists who subsequently became well known. The first issue featured Auden, Cocteau, Lucian Freud, Tennessee Williams, Angus Wilson, and many others as contributors. [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
