Aranda objects to labelisation of his film as an "erotic film", instead he defines it as "psycho-erotic": "heroine, Begoña's ambition is transparency. (...) She wants to enjoy life in its widest expression, and looks for clarity through sex."[tpl]cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Wettbewerb/In Competition | journal = Moving Pictures, Berlinale Extra | volume = | issue = | pages = p.30 | publisher = | location = Berlin | date = 11–22 February 1998 | url = | format = | issn = | accessdate = [/tpl]
