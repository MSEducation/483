==Text of resolution==

In this resolution, the co-signers of PACE reiterate that “considerable parts of the territory of Azerbaijan are still occupied by Armenian forces, and separatist forces are still in control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.”Ibid (retrieved on 21.09.2011) At the same time PACE underlined its concerns about “widespread ethnic hostilities which preceded it, led to large-scale ethnic expulsion and the creation of mono-ethnic areas which resemble the terrible concept of ethnic cleansing.“Ibid. See paragraph 2 of the Resolution.  By stating that “independence and secession of a regional territory from a state may only be achieved through a lawful and peaceful process based on the democratic support of the inhabitants of such territory and not in the wake of an armed conflict leading to ethnic expulsion and the de facto annexation of such territory to another state.”, PACE rejected claims that regional territories with minorities have an absolute right to secession.
PACE “recalls Resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993) of the United Nations Security Council and urges the parties concerned to comply with them, in particular … by withdrawing military forces from any occupied territories”.SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS - 1993
