The original cover of To Hell with the Devil caused a torrent of controversy, and was soon changed to an all-black design. The original artwork depicted four long haired angels throwing the devil into a fiery pit. The cover was then changed on later pressings to a basic black cover with the Stryper logo and the album title in the center.[tpl]cite web |author=Brett Christensen |title=Enigma Vinyl Pressing |url=http://www.stryper.com/articles-enigma.html |publisher=stryper.com |accessdate=January 18, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080107193033/http://www.stryper.com/articles-enigma.html  |archivedate = January 7, 2008[/tpl]
As the band started to record the album, Tim Gaines left the band. He was replaced by bassist Matt Hurich. That failed, so session bassist Brad Cobb took Gaines' place while recording this album. However, before the tour for it began, Gaines rejoined the band.
