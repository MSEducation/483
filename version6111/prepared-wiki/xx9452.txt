Omega-3 fatty acids (also called ω-3 fatty acids or n-3 fatty acids[tpl]cite web|title=Related terms|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fish-oil/NS_patient-fishoil/DSECTION=related-terms|work=Omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil, alpha-linolenic acid|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=June 20, 2012[/tpl]) are polyunsaturated fatty acids with a double bond (C=C) at the third carbon atom from the end of the carbon chain.[tpl]cite journal|last=Scorletti|first=E|coauthors=Byrne, CD|title=Omega-3 fatty acids, hepatic lipid metabolism, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.|journal=Annual review of nutrition|year=2013|volume=33|pages=231–48|pmid=23862644[/tpl] The fatty acids have two ends, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) end, which is considered the beginning of the chain, thus "alpha", and the methyl (CH3) end, which is considered the "tail" of the chain, thus "omega." The nomenclature of the fatty acid is taken from the location of the first double bond, counted from the methyl end, that is, the omega (ω-) or the n- end.
The three types of omega-3 fatty acids involved in human physiology are ALA (found in plant oils), EPA, and DHA (both commonly found in marine oils). Common sources of animal omega-3 EPA and DHA fatty acids include fish oils, egg oil, squid oils, krill oil, while some plant oils contain the omega 3 ALA fatty acid such as seabuckthorn and chia seeds, along with berry oils, clary sage seed oil, algal oil, flaxseed oil, Sacha Inchi oil, Echium oil, and hemp oil.
Omega-3 fatty acids are important for normal metabolism,[tpl]cite web|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcidsandHealth-HealthProfessional/|publisher=US National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements|title=Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Health: Fact Sheet for Health Professionals|year=2005|accessdate=12 April 2014[/tpl] but the health benefits of supplementation appear to be few if any. Omega-3s are considered essential fatty acids, meaning that they cannot be synthesized by the human body. However, mammals have a limited ability to synthesize omega-3 fats when the diet includes the shorter-chain omega-3 fatty acid ALA (α-linolenic acid, 18 carbons and 3 double bonds) to form the more important long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid, 20 carbons and 5 double bonds) and then from EPA, the most crucial, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22 carbons and 6 double bonds) with even greater inefficiency. The ability to make the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids from ALA may also be impaired in aging.[tpl]cite pmid|16829066[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid|22388930[/tpl] In foods exposed to air, unsaturated fatty acids are vulnerable to oxidation and rancidity.[tpl]cite pmid|17453926[/tpl]

==Health effects==

Supplementation does not appear to be associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality.

The evidence linking the consumption of fish to the risk of cancer is poor.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Sala-Vila|first1=A|author2=Calder, PC |title=Update on the relationship of fish intake with prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers |journal=Critical reviews in food science and nutrition|date=October–November 2011 |volume=51|issue=9|pages=855–71|pmid=21888535|doi=10.1080/10408398.2010.483527[/tpl] Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids does not appear to affect this either.[tpl]cite journal |last1=MacLean |first1=CH |author2=Newberry, SJ; Mojica, WA; Khanna, P; Issa, AM; Suttorp, MJ; Lim, YW; Traina, SB; Hilton, L; Garland, R; Morton, SC|title=Effects of omega-3 fatty acids on cancer risk: a systematic review.|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=2006-01-25|volume=295|issue=4|pages=403–15|pmid=16434631|doi=10.1001/jama.295.4.403[/tpl]
A 2006 review concluded that there was no link between omega-3 fatty acids consumption and cancer.

Some evidence suggests that people with certain circulatory problems, such as varicose veins, may benefit from the consumption of EPA and DHA, which may stimulate blood circulation, increase the breakdown of fibrin, a compound involved in clot and scar formation, and, in addition, may reduce blood pressure.
Evidently, omega-3 fatty acids reduce blood triglyceride levels, and regular intake may reduce the risk of secondary and primary heart attack.

==Chemistry==

[tpl]Citation needed span|text=Omega-3 fatty acids that are important in human physiology are α-linolenic acid (18:3, n-3; ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, n-3; EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, n-3; DHA). These three polyunsaturates have either 3, 5, or 6 double bonds in a carbon chain of 18, 20, or 22 carbon atoms, respectively. As with most naturally-produced fatty acids, all double bonds are in the cis-configuration, in other words, the two hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bond; and the double bonds are interrupted by methylene bridges (-[tpl]chem|CH|2[/tpl]-), so that there are two single bonds between each pair of adjacent double bonds.|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===List of omega-3 fatty acids===

This table lists several different names for the most common omega-3 fatty acids found in nature.

==Mechanism of action==

The 'essential' fatty acids were given their name when researchers found that they are essential to normal growth in young children and animals, though the modern definition of 'essential' is more strict. A small amount of omega-3 in the diet (~1% of total calories) enabled normal growth, and increasing the amount had little to no additional effect on growth.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Lands, William E.M. |year = 1992 | title = Biochemistry and physiology of n–3 fatty acids | journal = FASEB Journal | publisher = Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 8| pages = 2530–2536 | url = http://www.fasebj.org/content/6/8/2530.full.pdf | pmid = 1592205 | accessdate = 2008-03-21 |authorlink=William E.M. Lands [/tpl]
Likewise, researchers found that omega-6 fatty acids (such as γ-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid) play a similar role in normal growth. However, they also found that omega-6 was "better" at supporting dermal integrity, renal function, and parturition. These preliminary findings led researchers to concentrate their studies on omega-6, and it is only in recent decades that omega-3 has become of interest.
In 1964, it was discovered that enzymes found in sheep tissues convert omega-6 arachidonic acid into the inflammatory agent called prostaglandin E,2,[tpl]cite journal|author=Bergstrom, Danielson, Klenberg, and Samuelsson |title=The Enzymatic Conversion of Essential fatty Acids into Prostaglandins |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=239 |issue=11 |pages=PC4006–PC4008 |date=November 1964 |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/239/11/PC4006.full.pdf[/tpl] which both causes the sensation of pain and expedites healing and immune response in traumatized and infected tissues. By 1979, more of what are now known as eicosanoids were discovered: thromboxanes, prostacyclins, and the leukotrienes. The eicosanoids, which have important biological functions, typically have a short active lifetime in the body, starting with synthesis from fatty acids and ending with metabolism by enzymes. However, if the rate of synthesis exceeds the rate of metabolism, the excess eicosanoids may have deleterious effects. Researchers found that certain omega-3 fatty acids are also converted into eicosanoids, but at a much slower rate. Eicosanoids made from omega-3 fatty acids are often referred to as anti-inflammatory, but in fact they are just less inflammatory than those made from omega-6 fats. If both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are present, they will "compete" to be transformed, so the ratio of long-chain omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids directly affects the type of eicosanoids that are produced.
This competition was recognized as important when it was found that thromboxane is a factor in the clumping of platelets, which can both cause death by thrombosis and prevent death by bleeding. Likewise, the leukotrienes were found to be important in immune/inflammatory-system response, and therefore relevant to arthritis, lupus, asthma, and recovery from infections. These discoveries led to greater interest in finding ways to control the synthesis of omega-6 eicosanoids. The simplest way would be by consuming more omega-3 and fewer omega-6 fatty acids.
They are required during the prenatal period for the formation of synapses and cell membranes. These processes are also essential in postnatal human development for injury response of the central nervous system and retinal stimulation.[tpl]cite web|last=Bain|first= S. |year=2010|title= Achieving optimal omega-3 fatty acid status in the vegan population|location= Beloit, WI|publisher= Biochemistry Program|url=http://chemistry.beloit.edu/Ordman/posters/posttexts/prefa07/bain06.jpg[/tpl]

===Interconversion===

====Conversion efficiency of ALA to EPA and DHA====

Humans can convert short-chain omega-3 fatty acids to long-chain forms (EPA, DHA) with an efficiency below 5%.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Gerster H |title=Can adults adequately convert alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) to eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3)? |journal=Int.

These conversions occur competitively with omega-6 fatty acids, which are essential closely related chemical analogues that are derived from linoleic acid. Both the omega-3 α-linolenic acid and omega-6 linoleic acid must be obtained from food. Synthesis of the longer omega-3 fatty acids from linolenic acid within the body is competitively slowed by the omega-6 analogues. Thus, accumulation of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in tissues is more effective when they are obtained directly from food or when competing amounts of omega-6 analogs do not greatly exceed the amounts of omega-3.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]
The conversion of ALA to EPA and further to DHA in humans has been reported to be limited, but varies with individuals.Oregon State University Micronutrient Information Center: Essential Fatty Acids-Metabolism and Bioavailability http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/othernuts/omega3fa/#metabolism[ref]
</ref> Women have higher ALA conversion efficiency than men, which is presumed [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] to be due to the lower rate of use of dietary ALA for beta-oxidation. This suggests that biological engineering of ALA conversion efficiency is possible. Goyens ''et al.'' argue that it is the absolute amount of ALA, rather than the ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, that controls the conversion efficiency.<ref name="cala">

====The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio====

Some older clinical studies indicate that the ingested ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 (especially linoleic vs alpha-linolenic) fatty acids is important to maintaining cardiovascular health.
However, three studies published in 2005, 2007 and 2008, including a randomized controlled trial, found that, while omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are extremely beneficial in preventing heart disease in humans, the levels of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (and, therefore, the ratios) did not matter.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Griffin BA |title=How relevant is the ratio of dietary omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to cardiovascular disease risk?

Both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are essential; i.e., humans must consume them in their diet. Omega-6 and omega-3 eighteen-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids compete for the same metabolic enzymes, thus the omega-6:omega-3 ratio of ingested fatty acids has significant influence on the ratio and rate of production of eicosanoids, a group of hormones intimately involved in the body's inflammatory and homeostatic processes, which include the prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes, among others. Altering this ratio can change the body's metabolic and inflammatory state.[ref]
