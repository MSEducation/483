Cuban passports are issued to citizens of Cuba to facilitate international travel. They are valid for 6 years from the date of issuance, but have to be propagated every 2 years.Services and Consular Procedures, Embassy of Cuba in Suriname   
The cost of this passport is about US$200 (CUC 200) for every two years if one person lives in US.Cuban Interest Section in USA  
Until January 2013, the Cuban government required that all citizens desiring to leave the country would have to obtain an exit permit. This requirement was eased on 14 January 2013. The abolition of the hated requirement led to long lines at passport offices filled with citizens desiring to legally travel abroad; however, the lines were partly attributed to the fact that the cost of obtaining a passport was going to double the next day to the equivalent of US$100 (CUC 100), the equivalent of 5 months of average state salary. Now the passport is the only document required to leave the country, apart from a visa from the destination country. Previously the cost of a passport, exit permit, and associated paperwork added up to around  US$300 (CUC 300), the equivalent of 15 months of average state salary.[tpl]cite news|last=Rainsford|first=Sarah|title=Cubans set for foreign travel as exit permits abolished|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-21008571|accessdate=31 May 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=14 January 2013[/tpl]
