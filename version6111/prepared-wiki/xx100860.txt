The HK P11 is a Heckler & Koch pistol designed as an underwater firearm.

==Design==

Since ordinary-shaped rounds are inaccurate and have a very short range when used underwater, this pistol fires steel darts about [tpl]convert|10|cm[/tpl] long. It has five barrels, each of which is loaded with a cartridge, giving the gun a pepper-box appearance, and it is electrically ignited from a battery pack in the pistol grip.[tpl]cite web |url= http://world.guns.ru/handguns/hg209-e.htm|title= Heckler & Koch HK P11 Underwater Pistol|accessdate=2008-03-29 |work= Modern Firearms[/tpl] After firing all five cartridges, the barrel unit must be sent back to its manufacturer for reloading.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.specialboatservice.co.uk/sbs-weapons-p11.htm|title= Underwater Pistol - HK P11|accessdate=2008-03-28 |work= Special Boat Service: Information on the SBS[/tpl]  It is very similar to its predecessor, the Mk 1 Underwater Defense Gun.  In the past, Heckler & Koch has denied knowledge of its existence.[tpl]cite book |title= Weapons of the Navy SEALs|last= Dockery|first= Kevin|authorlink= Kevin Dockery (author)|year= 2004|publisher= Berkley|location= New York|isbn= 0-425-19834-0|page=68[/tpl]
This firearm is somewhat bulkier than its Soviet counterpart, the SPP-1 Underwater Pistol, but it has five barrels, as opposed to the Soviet firearm which has four. However, the SPP-1 does not need to be sent back to the manufacturer to be reloaded.
