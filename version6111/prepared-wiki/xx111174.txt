[[Linux kernel API]]

CATEGORIES: Linux kernel, Operating system APIs, Interfaces of the Linux kernel

The Linux kernel provides several interfaces to user-space applications that are used for different purposes and that have different properties by design.  There are two types of application programming interface (API) in the Linux kernel that are not to be confused: the "kernel–user space" API and the "kernel internal" API.

==Kernel–user space API==

The kernel–user space API is the API that allows programs in user space to access system resources and services of the Linux kernel. This API, by choice, never breaks. The POSIX API is only a small part of the Linux kernel API.
Much available free and open-source software is written for the POSIX API. But since the last POSIX version is from 2008, and since so much more development is going on with the Linux kernel as compared to the other POSIX-compatible kernels, various software has been developed that target solely the Linux kernel–user space API. Well-known examples are systemd and Weston.
People such as Lennart Poettering openly advocate writing software solely for the Linux kernel–user space API instead of POSIX, where this offers advantages.

==In-kernel API==

By choice, the Linux kernel has no stable in-kernel API (a.k.a. Binary Kernel Interface).[tpl]cite web |url=https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt |title=The Linux Kernel Driver Interface[/tpl]
