Aker Stadion, formerly known as Molde Stadion, is a football stadium located at Reknes in Molde, Norway, and is the home of Norwegian Premier League club Molde. The stadium has a capacity of 11,800 spectators.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.moldefk.no/index.php?page_id=807 |title=Aker Stadion |publisher=Molde FK |accessdate=31 October 2009[/tpl]
The building was designed by architect Kjell Kosberg. It cost [tpl]NOK|212 million[/tpl], most of which was paid for by club-owner Kjell Inge Røkke—after whom the ground has been nicknamed "Røkkeløkka". The main construction work took place 1997, and the stadium was inaugurated on 18 April 1998 in a league game against Lillestrøm, replacing Molde idrettspark as Molde's home ground. The stadium was nominated for the FIABCI Prix D' Excellence and awarded the City Prize in 1999. The record attendance of 13,308 was set in a league match against Rosenborg in 1998. The same year, the arena hosted its only international match, where Norway beat Saudi Arabia 6–0. The following year, when Molde reached the UEFA Champions League, the stadium was converted to an all-seater, reducing its capacity. Since May 2006, the stadium name has been sponsored by Røkke's company Aker. The field is scheduled to receive artificial turf in 2014.

==History==

Since 1955, Molde had been playing their home games at Molde idrettspark (at the time called Molde stadion), a municipal-owned multi-use venue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.moldefk.no/historikk/?m=i&p=his-nyttstadion |title=Nytt stadion |publisher=Molde FK |accessdate=24 May 2009 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] A new stadium was proposed to be located at the waterfront at Reknes. There were many local protests, including complaints about the size of the structure. Construction of the land fillings and preparation of the construction site started in March 1997, before final approval had been granted by the municipality.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mfkweb.org/anlegg.php?vis=stadion |title=Om Molde stadion |publisher=MFKweb |accessdate=24 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.moldefk.no/site/main/artikkel.php?page_id=42 |title=Fakta |publisher=Molde FK |accessdate=24 May 2009 |language=Norwegian| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090420084401/http://www.moldefk.no/site/main/artikkel.php?page_id=42| archivedate= 20 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The stadium was inaugurated on 18 April 1998, when the stadium was officially opened by Prime Minister and Molde-fan Kjell Magne Bondevik.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stadionsiden.com/index.asp?stadium_id=297 |title=Aker stadion |publisher=Stadionsiden |accessdate=24 May 2009 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] In the opening match, Molde beat Lillestrøm 4–0 in their first home game of the season, attracting 13,010 spectators.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.moldefk.no/historikk/?m=i&p=1998&e=m1990 |title=MFK vår 1998 |publisher=Molde FK |accessdate=24 May 2009 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] During the season, this was the match in the country with the most spectators not hosted at Rosenborg's home ground Lerkendal.

During the fall of 1999, Molde played two qualification games for UEFA Champions League at the stadium. Following the aggregated victories over CSKA Moscow[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=1999/round=1284/index.html |title=Second qualifying round |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=24 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090502154216/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=1999/round=1284/index.html| archivedate= 2 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and Mallorca,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=1999/round=1285/index.html |title=Third qualifying round |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=24 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090502022418/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=1999/round=1285/index.html| archivedate= 2 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Molde qualified for the group stage, where they played Real Madrid, Porto and Olympiacos.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=1999/round=1286/group=1095.html |title=Third qualifying round |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=24 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090429045040/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=1999/round=1286/group=1095.html| archivedate= 29 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Following entry into Champions League, the stadium was converted to an all-seater, with seats being installed on the lower sections of the short end stands. The reduced the attendance capacity permanently, because the club chose to not remove the seats afterwards.
In 2006, an agreement was made where Røkke's company Aker became the stadium name sponsor, with the stadium being renamed Aker stadion.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2006/04/28/464727.html |title=Røkkeløkka døpes om av Molde |work=Dagbladet |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=7 January 2012[/tpl] The same season, the club was relegated to the First Division, where the team played in 2007. Despite the relegation, average attendance increased, and Molde won the league. Since 2008, the team has again played in the Premier League.[tpl]cite news |url=http://fotball.adressa.no/eliteserien/index.jsp?service=default&stats=true&type=seasonattendance&seasonId=522 |title=Tilskuere 2006 |work=Adresseavisen |accessdate=24 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mfkweb.org/stattilskuere.php?sesong=2007 |title=Tilskuere 2007 |publisher=MFKweb |accessdate=24 May 2009[/tpl]
Molde later entered the UEFA Cup four times (renamed to Europa League in 2010), in 2000–01, 2003–04 and 2006–07, 2010–11, playing a total of eight home games, before they in 2012 again played qualification for the Champions League and Ventspils and Basel visited Aker Stadion. Molde were eliminated by Basel, but managed to qualify for the Europa League group stage and played against Heerenveen, Stuttgart, Steaua Bucuresti and Copenhagen at Aker Stadion.  
Aker Stadion has been proposed used during the annual Moldejazz, Norway's largest jazz festival, but this has been rejected several times by the festival management. The issue was intensified in 2004, when a much smaller arena was used for a quickly sold-out Stevie Wonder concert.[tpl]cite news |title=Fotball og jazz i utakt i Molde |work=Aftenposten |last=Mauren |first=Arnfinn |date=10 June 2004 |page=16 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] On 6 October 2007, StatoilHydro arranged a free concert at the stadium with Ane Brun and Röyksopp to celebrate the completion of their near-by processing plant for the gas field Ormen Lange.[tpl]cite news |title=Hydrock på Røkkeløkka |work=Dagbladet |last=Barstein |first=Geir |date=14 July 2007 |page=48 |language=Norwegian[/tpl] In a 2012 survey carried out by the Norwegian Players' Association among away-team captains, Ullevaal was found to be the league's fourth-best stadium, with a score of 4.27 on a scale from one to five.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_trondelag/1.8836297 |title=Lerkendal nest beste fotballbane |publisher=Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 November 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CYl4tTGG |language=Norwegian |archivedate=30 November 2012 |accessdate=30 November 2012[/tpl]
The club decided on 4 October 2013 to lay artificial turf on the field, which it hoped would be in place ahead of the 2014 season. The club was especially concerned with the poor surface during March, April, October and November. It also cited the possibility of hosting all trainings at the stadium and that the field could be used 2,000 instead of 130 hours per year.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/100Sport/fotball/eliteserien/Na-blir-det-kunstgress-i-Molde-396249_1.snd |title=Nå blir det kunstgress i Molde |last=Hustad |first=Trond |date=4 October 2013 |accessdate=4 October 2013 |work=Aftenposten |language=Norwegian[/tpl] The stadium hosted its second international match on 19 November 2013, when Norway was defeated 0–1 Scotland in a friendly match watched by 9,750 spectators.
