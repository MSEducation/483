This Week in Baseball signed Finch as a co-host. In a segment called the Jennie Challenge, Finch pitches to Major League Baseball players and often strikes them out. In softball, the mound is closer to home plate than baseball and Finch's pitches are the equivalent of a 98Â mph pitch. "Some big-timers refuse to face her," Cal Ripken, Jr. says. "Many feel it could be embarrassing." In an interview with ESPN, Finch explained, "I was throwing them mostly rise balls and change-ups. They've never seen a pitch like that, you know? With the closer distance from the mound, I think it really surprises them how fast the pitch gets there. And especially with the riseÂ â€“ when they're used to that over-the-top release pointÂ â€“ there is nothing else like it. The ball movement throws them off."[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/questions/JennieFinch.html|title=10 Burning Questions for Jennie Finch|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2010-07-25[/tpl]

On July 20, 2010, Finch announced her retirement from softball to focus on her family.

She continued playing with the Chicago Bandits until the National Pro Fastpitch season ended in August.
