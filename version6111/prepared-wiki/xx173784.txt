He is one of only 5 Clemson Tigers to hit for the cycle, doing so in Hawai'i against Hawai'i-Hilo on March 19, 1994. He was ACC Player of the Week twice in 1994, and the ACC Tournament MVP. He was named to the All-ACC Tournament team in 1994 and 1995.

==Admission of drug use==

On December 28, 2007, Monahan admitted in an interview with ESPN that he used the anabolic steroids Deca-Durabolin and Winstrol as well as amphetamines during his playing career. Monahan stated that he started using steroids in 1998, partly because of what he states was widespread use in the Mariners clubhouse.  
During the time he played with the Mariners, he played with players who were mentioned in the Mitchell Report, including Ryan Franklin, Glenallen Hill, David Segui and Todd Williams.
Three players have since come out to refute Monahan's comments regarding the Mariner clubhouse atmosphere.  
Raúl Ibáñez stated:  "It's amazing to me that a guy like Shane—a guy who was up and down at best and had a very limited cup of coffee with us—would be able to know what was going on. I was up and down like he was. I was in that same boat that he was in, and everyone makes their choice. In 10 years, I've never seen a person take a steroid" 
Jamie Moyer stated:  "I can tell you that I was there for 10 years and I never saw anyone take steroids. This will be my 20th year in the major leagues, and I don't even know what a steroid looks like. If I have to start relying on those things, after so many years in the game, then it's time to pack it in. That's the way I look at things."
Edgar Martínez, like former teammates Raúl Ibáñez and Jamie Moyer, denied allegations of such use in the clubhouse. Martínez made this statement while visiting the Mariners in spring training:
[tpl]cquote|I don't know why Monahan said that, I was there for a long time, and I didn't see what he saw...What are you going to do? There has been a lot of this going on around baseball...But like I said, I was there for a long time and never saw any of that.|||Edgar Martínez, seattletimes.com: March 15, [tpl]mlby|2008[/tpl].Edgar Martinez challenges report of Mariners' drug use seattletimes.com[/tpl]
