Tkuma ([tpl]lang-he-n|תְּקוּמָה[/tpl], lit. Resurrection) is a religious moshav in southern Israel. Located north-west of Netivot, it falls under the jurisdiction of Sdot Negev Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 514.

==History==

Tkuma was established as a kibbutz on the night of 5 and 6 October 1946 as one of the 11 points in the Negev at a location around a mile from the present site. The first residents were immigrants from Eastern Europe who survived the Holocaust. Its name reflects the resurrection of Israel.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
In 1949 the village moved to its present location near the site of  the  depopulated Palestinian  village of Al-Muharraqa. According to Morris, Tkuma is near the Al-Muharraqa site, but according to Khalidi, Tkuma, although only 2 km west of the Al-Muharraqa site,  is actually on land which formally belonged to the city of Gaza.Morris, 2004, p. xxi, settlement #56.Khalidi, 1992, p. 127.  
In the 1950s the moshav was joined by more immigrants from Eastern Europe and Tunisia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]

==Economy==

Since the 1990s, fish-farming has been an important economic branch. The sale of fresh fish to banquet halls and restaurants in the northern Negev has provided income for seven families.
