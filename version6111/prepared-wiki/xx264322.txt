East Challow is a village and civil parish about [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl] west of Wantage in the Vale of White Horse. Historically it was part of the ecclesiastical parish of Letcombe Regis, but since 1852 East and West Challow have formed their own single ecclesiastical parish.Page & Ditchfield, 1924, pages 222-228 East Challow was part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred the Vale of White Horse to Oxfordshire.

==Toponym==

Challow's toponym was Ceueslaue in the time of the Domesday Book in 1086. 13th century variants included Chaulea, Chaulauhe, Chawelawe and Shawelawe.

==Parish church==

The Church of England parish church of St. Nicolas was a Norman building of the 12th century, but the font and some masonry of the nave are now almost the only features surviving from this time. In the 13th century the chancel and chancel arch were rebuilt and the bell-cot and three-bay north aisle was added.Pevsner, 1966, page 131 The Decorated Gothic south chapel was added early in the 14th century.
The communion table was made in the 17th century. In the 18th century the aisle was rebuilt in brick and a porch was added over a 12th-century doorway. In 1858 St. Nicolas' was drastically restored, with the aisle and west front being rebuilt and the nave re-roofed. The rebuilding of the west front removed a 12th-century west doorway and a 15th-century west window above it. In 1884 the west tower was added at the west end of the aisle. The oak rood screen was added in 1905.
St. Nicolas' has two bells. They are not dated, but the smaller was cast by Robert Wells of Aldbourne, Wiltshire, which makes it very likely to date from the 18th century.

==Amenities==
