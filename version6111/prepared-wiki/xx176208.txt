[tpl]nihongo|Professor Layton|レイトン教授|Reiton-kyōju[/tpl] is a puzzle adventure game[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.professorlaytonds.com/#/gallery |title=Nintendo's Official Home for Professor Layton |publisher=Professorlaytonds.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23[/tpl] series for the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS developed by Level-5. The series consists of six games plus a film. A crossover game titled Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney has also been released for the Nintendo 3DS.
The first three games follow Professor Hershel Layton and Luke Triton's adventures together. The subsequent three games and the films are prequels, and focus on how Luke and Layton met, and their "original" adventures.
Each title is based in a series of puzzles and mysteries given by the citizens of towns that the main characters visit. It is not necessary to solve all the puzzles to progress, but some are mandatory, and at certain points in the game a minimum number of puzzles must be solved before the story can continue.
The series has gone on to be one of the most successful Nintendo DS exclusive series, with the lifetime cumulative sales of Professor Layton games standing at 10 million units sold as of October 2010.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/104551-Professor-Layton-Phoenix-Wright-Crossover-for-Japan-Only-Says-Capcom | title =  Prof. Layton/Phoenix Wright Crossover Only For Japan, Capcom Says | publisher = The Escapist | date = 2010-10-20 | accessdate = 2010-10-20 | first = Logan | last = Westbrook [/tpl] As of August 2013, the series has sold over 15 million copies.

==History==

Professor Layton was a direct result of Akihiro Hino's childhood love of Akira Tago's popular Atama no Taisou series of puzzle books, which have sold more than 12 million copies to date in Japan.[tpl]cite web|last=Eisenbeis|first=Richard|title=If it Weren't for This Book, Professor Layton Wouldn't Exist|url=http://kotaku.com/5988532/if-it-werent-for-this-book-professor-layton-wouldnt-exist|work=Kotaku|publisher=kotaku.com|accessdate=27 December 2013[/tpl] 
The main character in the Professor Layton games is Professor Hershel Layton, a renowned archaeologist and a well-mannered gentleman. He is called to solve various mysteries in different places. Professor Layton is always accompanied by his apprentice Luke Triton, a cheerful and curious boy who brings a touch of humor to the story of Layton. According to Hino, Layton is partly inspired by the character of Phoenix Wright of the Ace Attorney series, wanting to improve over the "bad points" of Phoenix's character in developing Layton.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-10-21-inafune-surprised-layton-wright-happened | title = Inafune surprised Layton/Wright happened | publisher = Eurogamer | date = 2010-10-21 | accessdate=  2010-10-21 |first = Rob | last = Fahey [/tpl]

==Games==

There was also a "Friendly Version" for The Curious Village, from which all weekly puzzles are unlocked, as well as the game being slightly easier for those who were troubled previously. For Diabolical Box, the Japan-only "Level-5 Premium Silver/Gold" collections on Nintendo DS included an exclusive side-story, [tpl]nihongo|"Professor Layton and the London Holiday"|レイトン教授とロンドンの休日[/tpl] in addition to the actual game and another Level-5 game, Inazuma Eleven. The Holiday in London includes ten puzzles, some of which are from the first game, and a short storyline, set in Professor Layton's London office, in which he reminisces about his previous adventures around the world.
A new mobile phone Professor Layton game is intended for release around the same time as the fifth game. However it is unknown if and when the game will get an international release.
Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is a crossover game between the Ace Attorney series and the Professor Layton series; it was co-developed by Capcom and Level-5 for the Nintendo 3DS. It is described as a combination of the two game styles – puzzle solving and crime investigation. Shu Takumi, the main writer of the original Ace Attorney games, wrote the script for this title.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-10-19-prof-layton-vs-phoenix-wright-is-real | title =  Prof. Layton VS Phoenix Wright is real | publisher = Eurogamer | date = 2010-10-19 | accessdate =2010-10-19 | first = Wesley | last = Yin-Poole [/tpl]

==Gameplay==

The game is essentially a collection of puzzles with exploration sections between them. The player, as Professor Layton and Luke, explore their environments in a point-and-click adventure game fashion using the DS's touchscreen. This can be used to talk with non-player characters, learn more about the environment, moving between different areas, or to find hint coins that are used during puzzles. Often, when interacting with a person or object, the player will be presented with a puzzle, valued at a number of "picarats", a type of currency within the game. Solving the puzzle correctly will earn the player that many picarats, but a wrong answer will reduce the value a small amount on subsequent attempts down to a minimal picarat number. In order to progress the plot, the player is required to solve specific puzzles, or to solve a minimum number of puzzles or gain a minimum amount of picarats. When the player leaves an area due to progression of the plot, puzzles they have yet to find or solve are collected and placed into a "Puzzle Shack" owned by a fictional character known as "Granny Riddleton", where they can return and attempt to resolve later. Curious Village contains 135 puzzles, Diabolical Box contains 153 puzzles, Unwound Future contains 168 (The later two having another special puzzle obtained via the use of codes found in the previous game), Last Specter contains 170 and Miracle Mask contains 150.
The puzzles take the form of brain teasers and are only loosely tied to the plot. All puzzles were created for this series by Akira Tago, who is famous for his best-selling Mental Gymnastics series. They take the forms of math problems, logic puzzles, mazes, sliding-block puzzles, and brain teasers. The games give the player the opportunity to bring up a translucent memo screen they can write on using the stylus to work out their answer before submission. If the player is stuck, they may spend one hint coin to receive a hint.  Each puzzle has three hints available, and within The Unwound Future, the game introduces "super hints" that nearly solve the puzzle for the player but which can only be bought with two hint coins and after the three other hints have been revealed. The puzzles are not timed, though for puzzles such as mazes or sliding blocks, the player may be challenged to complete the puzzle in a limited number of moves.
Each game features an additional set of three unique meta-puzzles that can be accessed at any time through "Layton's Trunk". These puzzles generally require the player to complete specific puzzles in the game to receive items to use within the meta puzzle; for example, The Curious Village gives the player furniture as a reward for some puzzles, which then must be placed within a set of apartments to Layton's and Luke's exacting desires in the meta puzzle; the meta puzzle cannot be solved completely until all the furniture has been collected.  Completing the game also opens a number of series of more difficult puzzles to be solved, including one that involves a curiously heavily-locked door that the player may encounter during the game. The games also can use the DS Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection features to connect to Nintendo world network and unlock additional puzzles for play for a number of weeks after each game's release.

==Setting and characters==

The game takes place in and around contemporary London. The titular character is Hershel Layton, a professor of archeology at the fictional Gressenheller University, who prides himself on gentlemanly conduct and puzzle mastery. He is often followed by his self-proclaimed apprentice, the 12-year-old Luke Triton, who also proves adept at solving puzzles. Following the events of The Curious Village, Layton is joined by Flora Reinhold who helps to tend his university offices but also seeks to go on Layton's adventures. 
Layton's mysteries often run him into the police chief of Scotland Yard, Inspector Chelmey. Layton also encounters a gifted inventor named Don Paolo (aka Paul), who is a master of disguise; he claims to be the nemesis of Layton, due to losing the love of his life, Claire, to Layton's charms. During the prequel trilogy, Layton's former assistant, Emmy Altava, joins up with him and Luke.

===Plot===

The only games and media with overarching structure are The Last Specter, The Eternal Diva, The Miracle Mask and The Azran Legacy. Other games and media in the Professor Layton series do not have any overarching structure or direct connection to each other, but do follow a chronological order through the appearance of reoccurring characters met in earlier works. 

===First Trilogy===

====The Curious Village====

The first game in the series, released for the Nintendo DS in Japan during 2007 and localized elsewhere during 2008. Layton and his young apprentice Luke are invited to the town of St. Mystere by the family of late Baron Augustus Reinhold to figure out the secret behind his last will and testament, in which he stated that anyone who found the Golden Apple hidden within the town would be entitled to his entire fortune. Upon entering the town, it is clear to both of them that the curious village holds many more secrets than they had expected. They solve their way through 138 puzzles to discover the truth behind St. Mystere.

====The Diabolical Box/Pandora's Box====

The second game in the series, released for the Nintendo DS in Japan during 2007 and localized elsewhere during 2009. It is known in PAL regions as Professor Layton and Pandora's Box. It begins with the Professor and Luke traveling to meet Layton's mentor, Dr. Schrader, who has sent the pair a letter detailing his procuring of the Elysian Box, a chest rumored to kill anyone who tried to open it. Upon walking into his apartment, he is found lying on the floor, dead, with the box missing. The only clue he left behind was a train ticket for the high-class Molentary Express without a mentioned destination, which they promptly catch to begin their investigation to find out more on the fate of Dr. Schrader, and the whereabouts of his diabolical box. During their search, they encounter 153 additional puzzles.

====The Unwound Future/The Lost Future====

The third game in the series, released for the Nintendo DS in Japan during 2008 and localized elsewhere during 2010. It is known in PAL regions as Professor Layton and the Lost Future. The game starts upon Luke receiving a letter purportedly sent by himself, ten years into the future, only a week after an accident in which Dr. Stahngun's failed demonstration of a time machine caused himself and the Prime Minister to vanish. He and Layton travel to a desolate part of town to investigate a clock shop, but upon walking out, find themselves to have been thrust forward into the future London, ten years from then. In their efforts to find the truth of their unwound future, they are forced to solve 168 new puzzles, and to remember a forgotten past. This game is the last in the series chronologically.

===Second Trilogy===

====The Last Specter/The Spectre's Call====

The fourth game in the series was released for the Nintendo DS in Japan during 2009 and North America on October 17, 2011. It is known in Europe as Professor Layton and the Spectre's Call. It is, chronologically, the first game in the series, in which Layton is called by an old friend named Clark to the mysterious, dark, and foggy town of Misthallery, where legends exist of a great, shadowy giant who protects the region whenever a special flute is played to summon him. However, recently, the figure has turned against the village, and it is up to the Professor, a young boy of the village named Luke Triton who is heavily involved in the legend of the Specter, and Layton's new assistant Emmy Altava, to figure out why the specter is wreaking havoc in the town. Together, they investigate the village and the Last Specter, and, while doing so, solve another 170 puzzles. In the USA and Japan, the game also includes an RPG called London Life, which was co-developed by Brownie Brown. It was excluded from the EU version due to 'time constraints'.

====The Eternal Diva (Movie)====

The first movie based on the games, released in Japan during 2009 and in the United Kingdom during 2010. Chronologically, the events in the story take place after Last Specter, though the story is told as a flashback at some point between Diabolical Box and Unwound Future (being the events of the flashback story took place 3 years prior). Emmy joins with Layton and Luke on a journey to meet Janice Quatlane, a previous student of Professor Layton experiencing success as an opera singer. One of her friends, Melina, a seven-year-old girl, claimed she had found eternal life. While investigating, Layton, Luke, and Janice become trapped on the ship, the Crown Petone, and are forced to cooperate with Descole's plans to restore the lost city of Ambrosia. Meanwhile, Emmy investigates mysterious disappearances of children around London. Many characters from the games make a cameo appearance, as does the Elysian Box itself.

==Other media==

Manga intended for child audiences was first serialized in February 2008 in the special edition of Bessatsu CoroCoro Comic. The series has since ended.

===Feature film===

An animation film called Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva was produced by Masakazu Kubo, who is mainly known for producing the Pokémon films, and animated by P.A.

It has been a general success in both Japan and Singapore where the movie was released. The film was released in the United Kingdom on DVD and Blu-ray Disc by Manga Entertainment on October 18, 2010.

==Reception==

The Professor Layton series has been generally successful in the UK, the US, and Japan. Professor Layton and the Curious Village sold over 700,000 units in Japan in 2007.[tpl]cite web | url = http://ds.ign.com/articles/840/840183p1.html | title =  Professor Layton Tops the Charts | publisher = IGN | date = 2007-12-07 | accessdate = 2010-12-30 | first = Anoop | last = Ganatayat [/tpl] The game was also the top selling game for the Nintendo DS in the United States in the first three weeks after its release. After it was restocked in the UK, sales of Professor Layton increased 54%, moving it from 10th place to fourth place.
Curious Village received generally positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator Game Rankings, the game had an average score of 86% based on 48 reviews. On Metacritic, the game had an average score of 85/100, based on 57 reviews. The combination of the adventure game and "brain training" genres received mixed appreciation. Some reviewers praised the game for the successful combination with 1UP commenting on how the game's approach is much better than games where the puzzles were integrated into the environment. Other reviewers felt that these two genres do not merge well within the game; Game Informer noted that while the player is given numerous small puzzles to solve, the mysteries of the main plot are basically solved for the player. The game was noted to have little replay value; once all the puzzles were solved, there was no point in playing through them again. The presentation of the game, including both the general European animation style and cutscene animations, was appreciated by reviewers. Hyper's Darren Wells commends the game for its "clever concept, with plenty to solve and unlock as well as its fantastic presentation". However, he criticizes "some puzzles feeling tacked on and the music can get annoying".
Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box was considered to be a major improvement from the original. In Japan, the game has sold 815,369 copies, according to Famitsu, as of July 9, 2008.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.japan-gamecharts.com/ds.php | title =  Nintendo DS Japanese Ranking | publisher = Japan-Gamecharts | date = 2010-12-05 | accessdate =2010-12-30[/tpl]  The UK's Official Nintendo Magazine awarded the game a score of 92% (and consequently their Gold Award medal), praising the increased number of puzzles, animated scenes and voice acting, but complained that it could be slightly repetitive at times. IGN gave the game a score of 8.5 and also their Editor's Choice Award.
The series was popular enough to have a movie called Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva made. So far it has only been released in Japan, Singapore, France, Germany and the UK, but was recently (2011) released in Spain, America and Canada. It received positive reviews from the first five countries, but has not yet been talked about in reviews in America and Canada. It was released in the UK on the 18th of October, with a full English Dub.[tpl]cite web|last=Ltd |first=Mastertronic |url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Professor-Layton-Eternal-Diva-DVD/dp/B003PHT5W4 |title=Professor Layton And The Eternal Diva DVD: Chris Miller, Maria Darling, Sarah Hadland, Wayne Forester, Masakazu Hashimoto: Film & TV |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23[/tpl]
