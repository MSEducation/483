As founder and leader of the [[Mouvement national congolais]] he helped win his country's independence from [[Belgium]] in June 1960.

He was subsequently imprisoned by state authorities under Joseph-Desiré Mobutu and executed by firing squad under the command of the secessionist Katangan authorities. The United Nations, which he had asked to come to the Congo, did not intervene to save him.
