==Career==

Born in Fakenham, Tann started his career with Cambridge United, after being awarded a professional contract at the beginning of the 1999–2000 season. He made his debut in the Football League Trophy defeat to Barnet, and remained in the reserve team until the first-half of the 2001–02 season, when he appeared for the Cambridge side which finished bottom of the Division Three, and winless at home.
Tann was to move to the Lilywhites of Cambridge City on loan, but otherwise stayed with United until 2005. He then signed for Gravesend & Northfleet, making one emergency appearance before moving back to the Football League with Notts County. 
In January 2006, he signed for Leyton Orient. Tann was diagnosed with testicular cancer in the autumn of 2006, but following a successful operation, he returned in the latter stages of the 2006–07 season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/low/football/teams/l/leyton_orient/6059318.stm|title=Orient's Tann has cancer surgery|date=17 October 2006|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 October 2009[/tpl] He scored an important goal in the club's history in a 2–0 away win against Bradford City to almost keep Orient safe of a place in League One for the 2007–08 season. Orient survived the next week against Nottingham Forest as results went their way. 
In May 2007 he rejected a new contract at Orient to re-join former club Notts County.
His cousins Ryan Jarvis and Rossi Jarvis are also professional footballers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://indepth.news.sky.com/InDepth/topic/Ryan_Jarvis_(footballer)|title=Ryan Jarvis (footballer) – In Depth|publisher=Sky News|accessdate=22 October 2009[/tpl] Ryan Jarvis was a teammate of Tann for a brief spell of the 2006/07 season, when Jarvis enjoyed a loan period at Leyton Orient.
On 18 October, Tann was stretchered off Notts County's Game with Macclesfield with a suspected broken leg from a horrific tackle from Macclesfield Midfielder Gareth Evans.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2008/10/20/league-2-notts-county-1-1-macclesfield-115875-20821133/|title=League 2: Notts County 1–1 Macclesfield|date=20 October 2008|newspaper=Daily Mirror|accessdate=22 October 2009[/tpl] At the end of the 2008–09 season, Tann was released by Notts County. On 16 July 2009, Tann signed a one-year deal at Conference National outfit Histon. He left Histon at the end of the 2009–10 season and signed for Conference South team Chelmsford City. In late 2010, Adam was asked to sign a Chelmsford kit for a crazed fan of his in Australia.
