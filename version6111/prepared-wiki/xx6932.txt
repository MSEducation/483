CATEGORIES: Literacy, Applied linguistics, Knowledge, Reading, Socioeconomics, Writing

Literacy is the ability to read and write.literacy at the Oxford English Dictionary The inability to do so is called illiteracy or analphabetism. Visual literacy also includes the ability to understand visual forms of communication such as body language, pictures, maps, and video.An inability to "read" body language is one of the features of autism. Evolving definitions of literacy often include all the symbol systems relevant to a particular community. Literacy encompasses a complex set of abilities to understand and use the dominant symbol systems of a culture for personal and community development. In a technological society, the concept of literacy is expanding to include the media and electronic text, in addition to alphabetic and number systems. These abilities vary in different social and cultural contexts according to need, demand and education.
The primary sense of literacy still represents the lifelong, intellectual process of gaining meaning from a critical interpretation of the written or printed text. The key to all literacy is reading development, a progression of skills that begins with the ability to understand spoken words and decode written words, and culminates in the deep understanding of text. Reading development involves a range of complex language underpinnings including awareness of speech sounds (phonology), spelling patterns (orthography), word meaning (semantics), grammar (syntax) and patterns of word formation (morphology), all of which provide a necessary platform for reading fluency and comprehension. Once these skills are acquired, the reader can attain full language literacy, which includes the abilities to approach printed material with critical analysis, inference and synthesis; to write with accuracy and coherence; and to use information and insights from text as the basis for informed decisions and creative thought.Margie Gillis, Ed.D., President, Literacy How, Inc., and Research Affiliate, Haskins Laboratories at Yale University; Sally Grimes, Ed.M., Executive Director, Literate Nation and Founder, Grimes Reading Institute; Cinthia Haan, Author and Chair, The Haan Foundation for Children and President, Power4Kids Reading Initiative; Peggy McCardle, Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief, Child Development and Behavior Branch, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Louisa Moats, Ed.D., President, Moats Associates Consulting, Inc.; Anthony Pedriana, Author and retired urban schoolteacher and principal; Susan Smartt, Ph.D., Senior Research Associate, National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality, Vanderbilt University; Catherine Snow,  Ph.D., Author, Researcher and Professor of Education,  Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard University; Cheryl Ward, M.S.M., C.A.L.P., Co-founder of Wisconsin Reading Coalition and academic language practitioner; Maryanne Wolf, Ed.D., Author and Director, Center for Reading and  Language Research, Tufts University.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines literacy as the "ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute, using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in their community and wider society".[tpl]cite paper|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001362/136246e.pdf|title=The Plurality of Literacy and its implications for Policies and Programs|work=UNESCO Education Sector Position Paper|year=2004|page=13[/tpl]

==History==

===Origins of literacy===

Literacy is thought to have first emerged with the development of numeracy and computational devices as early as 8,000 BCE. According to Stephen Chrisomalis, independent script development occurred at four times in human history in Mesopotamia, Egypt, lowland Mesoamerica, and China.Chrisomalis, Stephen (2009), "The Origins and Coevolution of Literacy and Numeracy", in Olsen, D. & Torrance, N. (Eds.), The Cambridge Handbook of Literacy (pp. 59-74). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
The earliest forms of written communication originated in Sumer, located in southern Mesopotamia in 8000 BCE. Peter Easton states, during this era, literacy was "a largely functional matter, propelled by the need to manage the new quantities of information and the new type of governance created by trade and large scale production".Easton, P. (in press). "History and spread of literacy", Excerpted from Sustaining Literacy in Africa: Developing a Literate Environment, Paris: UNESCO Press pp. 46-56. Denise Schmandt-Besserat argues that writing systems in Mesopotamia first emerged from a recording system in which people used impressed token markings to manage trade and agricultural production.Schmandt-Besserat, D. (1978). "The earliest precursor of writing", Scientific American, 238(6), 38-47. The token system served as a precursor to early cuneiform writing once people began simply recording information on clay tablets. According to Chrisomalis, proto-cuneiform texts exhibit not only numerical signs, but also ideograms depicting objects being counted.
Egyptian hieroglyphs emerged from 3300-3100 BCE and depicted royal iconography that emphasized power amongst other elites. The Egyptian hieroglyphic writing system was the first notation system to have phonetic values.
Writing in lowland Mesoamerica was first put into practice by the Olmec and Zapotec civilizations in 900-400 BCE. These civilizations used glyphic writing and bar-and-dot numerical notation systems for purposes related to royal iconography and calendar systems.
The earliest written notations in China date back to the Shang Dynasty in 1200 BCE. These systematic notations were found inscribed on bones and recorded sacrifices made, tributes received, and animals hunted, which were activities of the elite. These oracle-bone inscriptions were the early ancestors of modern Chinese script and contained logosyllabic script and numerals.
These examples indicate that early acts of literacy were closely tied to power and chiefly used for management practices.

===Origins of the alphabet===

According to social anthropologist Jack Goody, there are two interpretations that regard the origin of the alphabet. Many classical scholars, such as the renowned historian Ignace Gelb, credit the Ancient Greeks for creating the first alphabetic system (c. 750 BCE) that used distinctive signs for consonants and vowels. But Goody contests, “The importance of Greek culture of the subsequent history of Western Europe has led to an over-emphasis, by classicists and others, on the addition of specific vowel signs to the set of consonantal ones that had been developed earlier in Western Asia”.Goody, Jack (1987). The Interface Between The Written and the Oral. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 40-41. ISBN 0-521-33268-0.
Thus, many scholars argue that the Western Semites of Northern Canaan (modern-day Syria) invented the consonantal alphabet as early as 1500 BCE. Much of this theory’s development is credited to English archeologist Flinders Petrie, who, in 1905, came across a series of Canaanite inscriptions located in the turquoise mines of Serabit el-Khadem. Ten years later, English Egyptologist Alan Gardiner reasoned that these letters contain an alphabet, as well as references to the Canaanite goddess Asherah. In 1948, William F. Albright deciphered the text using additional evidence that had been discovered subsequent to Goody’s findings. This included a series of inscriptions from Ugarit, discovered in 1929 by French archaeologist Claude Schaeffer. Some of these inscriptions were mythological texts (written in an early Canaanite dialect) that consisted of a 32-letter cuneiform consonantal alphabet.
Another significant discovery was made in 1953 when three arrowheads were uncovered, each containing identical Canaanite inscriptions from twelfth century BCE. According to Frank Moore Cross, these inscriptions consisted of alphabetic signs that originated during the transitional development from pictographic script to a linear alphabet. Moreover, he asserts, “These inscriptions also provided clues to extend the decipherment of earlier and later alphabetic texts”.Cross, Frank Moore, "Newly Found Inscriptions in Old Canaanite and Early Phoenician Scripts", Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 238 (Spring, 1980) p. 1-20.
The consonantal system of the Canaanite language inspired alphabetical developments in subsequent languages. During the Late Bronze Age, successor alphabets appeared throughout the Mediterranean region and sub-developed into three languages: Phoenician, Hebrew and Aramaic.
According to Goody, these cuneiform scripts may have influenced the development of the Greek alphabet several centuries later. Historically, the Greeks contended that their language was modeled after the Phoenicians. However, many Semitic scholars now believe that Ancient Greek is more consistent with an early form Canaanite that was used c. 1100 BCE. While the earliest Greek inscriptions are dated c. eighth century BCE, epigraphical comparisons to Proto-Canaanite suggest that the Greeks may have adopted the language as early as 1100 BCE, and later “added in five characters to represent vowels”.Goody, Jack (1987). The Interface Between The Written and the Oral. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 40-49. ISBN 0-521-33268-0
Phoenician, which is considered to contain the first “linear alphabet”, rapidly spread to the Mediterranean port cities in the northern Palestinian region. Some archeologists believe that Phoenician scripture had some influence on the developments of the Hebrew and Aramaic alphabets based on the fact that these languages evolved during the same time period, share similar features, and are commonly categorized into the same language group.McCarter, P. Kyle. "The Early Diffusion of the Alphabet", The Biblical Archaeologist 37, No. 3 (Sep., 1974): 59-61.
When the Hebrews migrated to Palestine between 1200 and 1001 BCE, they also adopted a variation of the Canaanite alphabet. Baruch ben Neriah, Jeremiah’s scribe, used this alphabet to create the later scripts of the Old Testament. The Early Hebrew alphabet was prominent in the Mediterranean region until Assyrian rulers exiled the Jews to Babylon in the sixth century BCE. It was then that the new language (“Square Hebrew”) emerged and the older language rapidly died out.
The Aramaic alphabet also emerged sometime between 1200 and 1001 BCE. As the Bronze Age collapsed, the Aramaeans moved into Canaan and Phoenician territories and adopted their scripts. Although early evidence of this writing is scarce, archeologists have uncovered a wide range of later Aramaic texts, written as early as the seventh century BCE. Due to its longevity and prevalence in the region, Achaemenid rulers eventually adopted it as a “diplomatic language”.Goody, Jack (1987). The Interface Between The Written and the Oral. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 50. ISBN 0-521-33268-0 The modern Aramaic alphabet rapidly spread east to the Kingdom of Nabataea, then to Sinai and the Arabian Peninsula, eventually making its way to Africa. Aramaic Merchants carried older variations of the language as far as India, where it later influenced the development of Brahmi scripture. It also led to the developments of Arabic, Pahlavi (an Iranian adaptation), “as well as for a range of alphabets used by early Turkish and Mongol tribes in Siberia, Mongolia and Turkestan”.Goody, Jack (1987). The Interface Between The Written and the Oral. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 49-51. ISBN 0-521-33268-0
The Aramaic language eventually died out with spread of Islam and its influence of Arabic.

===Ancient and medieval literacy===

Until recently it was thought that the majority of people were illiterate in ancient times.  However, recent work has challenged this long held notion. Anthony DiRenzo asserts that Roman society was “a civilization based on the book and the register”, and "no one, either free or slave, could afford to be illiterate".Di Renzo, Anthony (2000) “His master's voice: Tiro and the rise of the roman secretarial class”, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, vol. 30, (2) 155-168 Similarly Dupont points out, "The written word was all around them, in both public and private life: laws, calendars, regulations at shrines, and funeral epitaphs were engraved in stone or bronze. The Republic amassed huge archives of reports on every aspect of public life".Dupont, Florence. (1989) Daily Life in Ancient Rome Tr. Christopher Woodall. Oxford: Blackwell; p. 223
When the Western Roman Empire fell apart literacy became a distinguishing mark of the elite, and communications skills were politically important.This connection is pursued in Alan K. Bowman and Greg Woolf, eds., Literacy and Power in the Ancient World, (Cambridge) 1994.
In the late fourth century the Desert Father Pachomius expected literacy of a candidate for admission to his monasteries:
 they shall give him twenty Psalms or two of the Apostles' epistles or some other part of Scripture. And if he is illiterate he shall go at the first, third and sixth hours to someone who can teach and has been appointed for him. He shall stand before him and learn very studiously and with all gratitude. The fundamentals of a syllable, the verbs and nouns shall all be written for him and even if he does not want to he shall be compelled to read.Pachomius, Rule 139. 

===Literacy in Europe===

====England====

In 12th and 13th century England, the ability to recite a particular passage from the Bible in Latin entitled a common law defendant to the so-called benefit of clergy—i.e., trial before an ecclesiastical court, where sentences were more lenient, instead of a secular one, where hanging was a likely sentence. Thus literate lay defendants often claimed the right to benefit of clergy, while an illiterate person who had memorized the psalm used as the literacy test, Psalm 51 ("O God, have mercy upon me..."), could also claim benefit of clergy.[tpl]Cite book|author=Baker, John R. |title=An Introduction to English Legal History |publisher=Butterworths LexisNexis |location=London |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-406-93053-8 [/tpl]

====Wales====

Formal higher education in the arts and sciences in Wales, from the Dark Ages to the 18th century, was the preserve of the wealthy and the clergy. As in England, Welsh history and archaeological finds dating back to the Bronze Age reveal not only reading and writing, but also alchemy, botany, advanced maths and science. Following the Roman occupation and the conquest by the English, education in Wales was at a very low ebb in the early modern period; in particular, formal education was only available in English while the majority of the population spoke only Welsh. The first modern grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin, Brecon, and Cowbridge. One of the first modern national education methods to use the native Welsh language was started by Griffith Jones in 1731.For more information see History of Wales#Early modern period Jones was the rector of Llanddowror from 1716 and remained there for the rest of his life. He organized and introduced a Welsh medium circulating school system, which was attractive and effective for Welsh speakers, while also teaching them English, which gave them access to broader educational sources. The circulating schools may have taught half the country's population to read. Literacy rates in Wales by the mid-18th century were one of the highest.

====Continental Europe====

The ability to read did not necessarily imply the ability to write. The 1686 church law (kyrkolagen) of the Kingdom of Sweden (which at the time included all of modern Sweden, Finland, Latvia and Estonia) enforced literacy on the people, and by 1800 the ability to read was close to 100%. But as late as the 19th century, many Swedes, especially women, could not write. That said, the situation in England was far worse than in Scandinavia, France, and Prussia: as late as 1841, 33% of all Englishmen and 44% of Englishwomen signed marriage certificates with their mark as they were unable to write (government-financed public education was not available in England until 1870 and, even then, on a limited basis).
Historian Ernest Gellner argues that Continental European countries were far more successful in implementing educational reform precisely because their governments were more willing to invest in the population as a whole.[tpl]Cite book|author= Ernest Gellner |title=Nations and Nationalism |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |year=1983 |isbn=0-8014-9263-7[/tpl] The view that public education contributes to rising literacy levels is shared by the majority of historians.
Although the present-day concepts of literacy have much to do with the 15th-century invention of the movable type printing press, it was not until the Industrial Revolution of the mid-19th century that paper and books became affordable to all classes of industrialized society. Until then, only a small percentage of the population were literate as only wealthy individuals and institutions could afford the materials. Even [tpl]As of|2008|alt=today[/tpl], the cost of paper and books is a barrier to universal literacy in some less-industrialized nations.
On the other hand, historian Harvey Graff argues that the introduction of mass schooling was in part an effort to control the type of literacy that the working class had access to. According to Graff, literacy learning was increasing outside of formal settings (such as schools) and this uncontrolled, potentially critical reading could lead to increased radicalization of the populace. In his view, mass schooling was meant to temper and control literacy, not spread it.[tpl]Cite book|last=Graff|first=Harvey J. |title=The literacy myth: cultural integration and social structure in the nineteenth century |url=http://books.google.com/?id=AAj9sM99qekC|year=1991|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-88738-884-2|page=xxvi|ref=harv[/tpl] Graff also points out, using the example of Sweden, that mass literacy can be achieved without formal schooling or instruction in writing.

===Literacy in North America===

====Canada====

=====Colonial days (1600s–1762)=====

Research on the literacy rates of Canadians in the colonial days rested largely on examinations of the proportion of signatures to marks on parish acts (birth, baptismal, and marriage registrations).  Although some researchers have concluded that signature counts drawn from marriage registers in nineteenth century France corresponded closely with literacy tests given to military conscripts,[tpl]cite book|last=Furet|first=François|title=Lire et écrire: l'alphabétisation des Français de Calvin à Jules Ferry|year=1977|publisher=Editions de Minuit|location=Paris|page=353[/tpl] others regard this methodology as a “relatively unimaginative treatment of the complex practices and events that might be described as literacy” (Curtis, 2007, p. 1-2).[tpl]cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Bruce|title=Beyond Signature Literacy: New Research Directions|journal=Historical Studies in Education / Revue d'histoire de l'éducation|year=2007|issue=Fall Special Issue|pages=1–12|url=http://historicalstudiesineducation.ca/index.php/edu_hse-rhe/article/view/533/734|accessdate=October 23, 2012|volume=19[/tpl]  But censuses (dating back to 1666) and official records of New France offer few clues of their own on the population’s levels of literacy, therefore leaving few options in terms of materials from which to draw literary rate estimates.
In his research of literacy rates of males and females in New France, Trudel found that in 1663, of 1,224 persons in New France who were of marriageable age, 59% of grooms and 46% of brides wrote their name; however, of the 3,000-plus colony inhabitants, less than 40% were native born.[tpl]cite journal|last=Magnuson|first=Roger|title=Two myths in New France education|journal=McGill Journal of Education|year=1985|volume=20|issue=3|url=http://mje.mcgill.ca/index.php/MJE/article/viewArticle/7636|accessdate=October 23, 2012[/tpl] Signature rates were therefore likely more reflective of rates of literacy among French immigrants. Magnuson’s (1985) research revealed a trend: signature rates for the period of 1680–1699 were 42% for males, 30% for females; in 1657-1715, they were 45% for males and 43% for females; in 1745-1754, they were higher for females than for males. He believed that this upward trend in rates of females’ ability to sign documents was largely attributed to the larger number of female-to-male religious orders, and to the proportionately more active role of women in health and education, while the roles of male religious orders were largely to serve as parish priests, missionaries, military chaplains and explorers. 1752 marked the date that Canada’s first newspaper—the Halifax Gazette—began publication.[tpl]cite web|title=Newspapers|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/newspapers|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute[/tpl]

=====From the British Conquest (1763) to Confederation (1867)=====

The end of the Seven Years' War in 1763 allowed two Philadelphia printers to come to Québec City and to begin printing a bilingual Quebec Gazette in 1764, while in 1785 Fleury Mesplet started publication of the Montreal Gazette, which is now the oldest continuing newspaper in the country.
In the 19th century, everything about print changed, and literature in its many forms became much more available.[tpl]cite book|last=Aliaga-Buchenau|first=Ana-Isabel|title=Dangerous Potential of Reading: Readers and the Negotiation of Power in Selected Nineteenth-Century Narratives|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-96833-X|page=202|url=http://site.ebrary.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/lib/oculbrock/docDetail.action?docID=10098857[/tpl] But educating the Canadian population in reading and writing was nevertheless a huge challenge. Concerned about the strong French Canadian presence in the colony, the British authorities repeatedly tried to help establish schools that were outside the control of religious authorities, but these efforts were largely undermined by the Catholic Church and later the Anglican clergy.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Education|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/history-of-education|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute|accessdate=October 28, 2012[/tpl]
From the early 1820s in Lower Canada, classical college curriculum, which was monopolized by the Church, was also subject to growing liberal and lay criticism, arguing it was fit first and foremost to produce priests, when Lower Canadians needed to be able to compete effectively with foreign industry and commerce and with the immigrants who were monopolizing trade (Curtis, 1985)).  Liberal and lay attempts to promote parish schools generated a reaction from the Catholic and later the Anglican clergy in which the dangers of popular literacy figured centrally.  Both churches shared an opposition to any educational plan that encouraged lay reading of the Bible, and spokesmen for both warned of the evil and demoralizing tendencies of unregulated reading in general. Granted the power to organize parish schooling through the Vestry School Act of 1824, the Catholic clergy did nothing effective.
Despite this, the invention of the printing press had laid the foundation for the modern era and universal social literacy, and so it is that with time, “technologically, literacy had passed from the hands of an elite to the populace at large. Historical factors and sociopolitical conditions, however, have determined the extent to which universal social literacy has come to pass”.Audrey M. Thomas, "Adult Illiteracy in Canada—A Challenge" (Ottawa: Canadian Commission for UNESCO, Occasional Paper 42, 1983).

=====1868–1986=====

In 1871 only about half of French Canadian men in Canada self-reported that they were literate, whereas 90 percent of other Canadian men said they could read and write, but information from the Canadian Families Project sample of the 1901 Census of Canada indicated that literacy rates for French Canadians and other Canadians increased, as measured by the ability of men between the ages of 16 and 65 to answer literacy questions.[tpl]cite journal|last=Green|first=A|coauthors=MacKinnon, M., & Minns, C.|title=Conspicuous by their absence: French Canadians and the settlement of the Canadian West|journal=The Journal of Economic History|year=2005|volume=65|issue=3|pages=822–849|jstor=3875019|doi=10.1017/S0022050705000306[/tpl] Compulsory attendance in schools was legislated in the late 19th century in all provinces but Quebec, but by then, a change in parental attitudes towards educating the new generation meant that many children were already attending regularly.  Unlike the emphasis of school promoters on character formation, the shaping of values, the inculcation of political and social attitudes, and proper behaviour, many parents supported schooling because they wanted their children to learn to read, write, and do arithmetic. Efforts were made to exert power and religious, moral, economic/professional, and social/cultural influence over children who were learning to read by dictating the contents of their school readers accordingly. But educators broke from these spheres of influence and also taught literature from a more child-centred perspective: for the pleasure of it (Murphy, 2012).[tpl]cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Sharon|title=Regaining Pleasure in the Teaching of Reading|journal=Language Arts|year=2012|volume=89|issue=5|pages=318–328|url=http://www.ncte.org.proxy.library.brocku.ca/journals/la/issues/v89-5|accessdate=October 23, 2012[/tpl]
Educational change in Québec began as a result of a major commission of inquiry at the start of what came to be called the "Quiet Revolution" in the early 1960s.  In response to the resulting recommendations, the Québec government revamped the school system in an attempt to enhance the francophone population's general educational level and to produce a better-qualified labour force. Catholic Church leadership was rejected in favour of government administration and vastly increased budgets were given to school boards across the province.
With time, and with continuing inquiry into the literacy achievement levels of Canadians, the definition of literacy moved from a dichotomous one (either a person could, or couldn’t write his or her name, or was literate or illiterate), to ones that considered its multidimensionality, along with the qualitative and quantitative aspects of literacy. In the 1970s, organizations like the Canadian Association for Adult Education (CAAE) believed that one had to complete the 8th grade to achieve functional literacy.  Examination of 1976 census data, for example, found that 4,376,655, or 28.4% of Canadians 15 years of age and over reported a level of schooling of less than grade 9 and were thus deemed not functionally literate. But in 1991, UNESCO formally acknowledged Canada’s findings that assessment of educational attainment as proxy measure of literacy was not as reliable as was direct assessment.[tpl]cite web|last=UNESCO|title=Functional Literacy in Eastern and Western Europe|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000906/090661eo.pdf |publisher=UNESCO Institute for Education|accessdate=October 28, 2012[/tpl] This dissatisfaction manifested itself in the development of actual proficiency tests that measure reading literacy more directly.[tpl]cite web|last=OECD, Statistics Canada|title=Literacy for Life: Further Results from the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey|url=http://dx.doi.org/9789264091269-en|publisher=OECD Publishing|accessdate=23 October 2012[/tpl]

=====Direct systematic measures of literacy in Canada, 1987 to present=====

Canada conducted its first literacy survey in 1987 which discovered that there were more than five million functionally illiterate adults in Canada, or 24 per cent of the adult population.  Statistics Canada then conducted three national and international literacy surveys of the adult population — the first one in 1989 commissioned by the Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) department.
This first survey was called the “Literacy Skills Used in Daily Activities” (LSUDA) survey, and was modeled on the 1985 U.S. survey of young adults (YALS).[tpl]cite web|last=OECD, Statistics Canada (2011)|title=Literacy for Life: Further Results from the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey|url=http://dx.doi.org/9789264091269-en|publisher=OECD Publishing|accessdate=23 October 2012[/tpl]  It represented a first attempt in Canada to produce skill measures deemed comparable across languages. Literacy, for the first time, was measured on a continuum of skills.  The survey found that 16% of Canadians had literacy skills too limited to deal with most of the printed material encountered in daily life whereas 22% were considered “narrow” readers.
In 1994-95, Canada participated in the first multi-country, multi-language assessment of adult literacy, the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS). A stratified multi-stage probability sample design was used to select the sample from the Census Frame. The sample was designed to yield separate samples for the two Canadian official languages, English and French, and participants were measured on the dimensions of prose literacy, document literacy and quantitative literacy.  The survey found that 42.2%, 43% and 42.2% of Canadians between the ages of 16 and 65 scored at the lowest two levels of Prose Literacy, Document Literacy and Quantitative Literacy, respectively.  The survey presented many important correlations, among which was a strong plausible link between literacy and a country’s economic potential.
In 2003, Canada participated in the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey (ALL). This survey contained identical measures for assessing the prose and document literacy proficiencies, allowing for comparisons between survey results on these two measures and found that 41.9% and 42.6% of Canadians between the ages of 16 and 65 scored at the lowest two levels of Prose Literacy and document literacy respectively. Further, Canadians’ mean scores also improved on both the prose and the document literacy scales.
The OECD's Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) is expected to produce new comparative skill profiles in late 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=4406&lang=en&db=imdb&adm=8&dis=2 |title=Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) |publisher=3.statcan.gc.ca |date=2012-07-12 |accessdate=2012-10-29[/tpl]

====Mexico====

Mexico has long been notorious for its low literacy rate.  In the 1960s, because the majority of the residents of the federal capital were illiterate, the planners of the Mexico City Metro designed a system of unique icons to identify each station in the system in addition to its formal name.

====United States====

In 1820, 20% of the entire adult white population was illiterate, and 80% of the African American population was illiterate. By 1900 the situation had improved somewhat, but 44% of African American people remained illiterate. There were significant improvements for African American and other races in the early 20th century as the descendants of former slaves, who had had no educational opportunities, grew up in the post Civil War period and often had some chance to obtain a basic education. The gap in illiteracy between white and black adults continued to narrow through the 20th century, and in 1979 the rates were about the same.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/naal/lit_history.asp |title=National Assessment of Adult Literacy |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl]

=====Cultural and westernized literacy for Native Americans in the United States=====

Before colonization, oral storytelling and communication comprised most if not all Native American literacy. Native people communicated and retained their histories verbally—it was not until the beginning of American Indian boarding schools that reading and writing forms of literacy were forced onto Native Americans. While literacy rates of English increased, forced assimilation exposed Native children to physical and sexual abuse, unsanitary living conditions and even death. Many students ran away in an attempt to hold on to their cultural identity and literary traditions that were relevant to their community. While these formalized forms of literacy prepared Native youth to exist in the changing society, they destroyed all traces of their cultural literacy. Native children would return to their families unable to communicate with them due to the loss of their indigenous language. In the 20th and 21st century, there is still a struggle to learn and maintain cultural language. But education initiatives and programs have increased overall—according to the 2010 census, 86 percent of the overall population of American Indians and Alaska Natives have high school diplomas, and 28 percent have a bachelor’s degree or higher.[tpl]cite web| title= American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month: November 2011 |publisher = United States Census Bureau | url= http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/cb11-ff22.html[/tpl]

===Literacy in South America===

In 1964 in Brazil, Paulo Freire was arrested and exiled for teaching peasants to read.Lownd, Peter. "Freire's Life and Work."
Since democracy returned to Brazil, however, there has been a steady increase in the percentage of literate people.

===Literacy in Africa===

Currently, Africa is the continent with the lowest literacy rate in the world.

====Algeria====

The literacy rate of Algeria is around 70%: education is compulsory and free in Algeria up to age of 17.

====Botswana====

Botswana has among the highest literacy rates in the developing world with around 85% of its population being literate.

====Egypt====

Egypt has a relatively high literacy rate.
The adult literacy rate in 2010 was estimated at 72.0%.[tpl]cite web|title=National adult literacy rates (15+), youth literacy rates (15-24) and elderly literacy rates (65+)|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=210|publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics[/tpl]
Education is compulsory from ages 6 to 15 and free for all children to attend. 93% of children enter primary school today, compared with 87% in 1994.

====Ethiopia====

The Ethiopians are among the first literate people in the world, having written, read, and created manuscripts in their ancient language of Ge'ez (Amharic) since the second century CE.Weninger, Stefan. Semitic Languages: An International Handbook. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton, 2011. All boys learned to read the Psalms around the age of 7. National literacy campaign introduced in 1978 increased literacy rates to between 37% (unofficial) and 63% (official) by 1984.[tpl]Cite book|editor=Thomas P.

====Kenya====

The literacy rate in Kenya among people below 20 years of age is over 70%, as the first 8 years of primary school are provided tuition-free by the government. In January 2008, the government began offering a restricted program of free secondary education. Literacy is much higher among the young than the old population, with the total being about 53% for the country. Most of this literacy, however, is elementary—not secondary or advanced.

===Literacy in Asia===

====China====

The PRC conducts standardized testing to assess proficiency in Putonghua but it is primarily for foreigners or those needing to demonstrate professional proficiency in the Beijing dialect. Literacy in logographic languages like Chinese has been graded on the number of characters in the speaker's lexicon, with a few thousand considered the minimum for practical literacy. Similar tests exist in other countries where Chinese is an official language. Chinese can be expressed phonetically and alphabetically but Chinese speakers prefer the Chinese logographic system.

====India====

====Laos====

Laos has the lowest level of adult literacy in all of Southeast Asia other than East Timor.hdrstats.undp.org, accessed June 27, 2011
Obstacles to literacy vary by country and culture as writing systems, quality of education, availability of written material, competition from other sources (television, video games, cell phones, and family work obligations), and culture all influence literacy levels. In Laos, which has a phonetic alphabet, reading is relatively easy to learn—especially compared to English, where spelling and pronunciation rules are filled with exceptions, and Chinese, with thousands of symbols to be memorized. But a lack of books and other written materials has hindered functional literacy in Laos, where many children and adults read so haltingly that the skill is hardly beneficial.
A literacy project in Laos addresses this by using what it calls "books that make literacy fun!" The project, Big Brother Mouse, publishes colorful, easy-to-read books, then delivers them by holding book parties at rural schools. Some of the books are modeled on successful western books by authors such as Dr. Seuss; the most popular, however, are traditional Lao fairy tales. Two popular collections of folktales were written by Siphone Vouthisakdee, who comes from a village where only five children finished primary school.[tpl]cite news|last=Krausz|first=Tibor|title=Publishing Children's Books – And Delivering Them by Elephant| url= http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Making-a-difference/2011/0221/Publishing-children-s-books-and-delivering-them-by-elephant| accessdate=25 December 2013|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=21 February 2011[/tpl]
Big Brother Mouse has also created village reading rooms, and published books for adult readers about subjects such as Buddhism, health, and baby care.Wells, Bonnie. "Picturing Laos”. Amherst Bulletin, August 27, 2010

====Pakistan====

In Pakistan, the National Commission for Human Development (NCHD) aims to bring literacy to adults, especially women.
ISLAMABAD - UNESCO Islamabad Director Kozue Kay Nagata has said, “Illiteracy in Pakistan has fallen over two decades, thanks to the government and people of Pakistan for their efforts working toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals”. “Today, 70 percent of Pakistani youths can read and write. In 20 years, illiterate population has been reduced significantly”, she said while speaking at a function held in connection with International Literacy Day.
However, she also emphasised on the need to do more to improve literacy in the country and said, “The proportion of population in Pakistan lacking basic reading and writing is too high. This is a serious obstacle for individual fulfillment, to the development of societies, and to mutual understanding between peoples.” Referring to the recent national survey carried out by the Ministry of Education, Trainings and Standards in Higher Education with support of UNESCO, UNICEF, and provincial and areas departments of education, Nagata pointed out that, in Pakistan, although primary school survival rate is 70 percent, gender gap still exists with only 68 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to 71 percent for boys. Specifically in the case of Punjab, she said, primary school survival rate today is better with 76 percent, but not without a gender gap of 8 percent points with 72 percent girls’ survival rate compared to 80 percent for boys. She also pointed out that average per student spending in primary level (age 5-9) was better in Punjab: Rs 6,998, compared to the national average. In Balochistan, although almost the same amount (Rs 6,985) as in Punjab is spent per child, the primary school survival rate is only 53 percent. Girls’ survival rate is slightly better with 54 percent than that of boys which is 52 percent.
The data of the survey shows that in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, primary school survival rate is 67 percent which is lower than the national average of 70 percent. Furthermore, gender gap also exists with only 65 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to that of boys which is 68 percent. Per-student education expenditure in primary level (age 5-9) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is Rs 8,638. In Sindh, primary school survival rate is 63percent, with a gender gap of only 67 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to 60 percent for boys. Per student education expenditure in primary level (age 5-9) in Sindh is Rs 5,019. Nagata made reference to the survey report and mentioned that the most common reason in Pakistan for children (both boys and girls) of age 10 to 18 years leaving school before completing primary grade is “the child not willing to go to school”, which may be related to quality and learning outcome. She said, however, and sadly, for the girls living in rural communities the second highest reason for dropout is “parents did not allow” which might be related to prejudice and cultural norm against girls.

====Philippines====

In the Philippines, it is assumed that before the Spanish colonization, the natives of the Philippine islands were universally literate that all can read and write in their own respective languages. 
Early Filipinos devised and used their own system of writings from 300 BC, which derived from the Brahmic family of scripts of Ancient India. Baybayin became the most widespread of these derived scripts by the 11th century.
Early chroniclers, who came during the first Spanish expeditions to the islands, noted the proficiency of some of the natives, especially the chieftain and local kings, in Sanskrit, Old Javanese, Old Malay,and several other languages.http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/lci/lci.htmBergreen, Laurence.Over The Edge of The World: Magellan’s Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe. New York. 2003.
During the Spanish colonization of the islands, reading materials were destroyed to a far much less extent compared to the Spanish colonization of the Americas. The Spaniards tried to rub literacy in the islands to prevent the islanders to unite. Education and literacy was introduced only to the Peninsulares and remained a privilege until the Americans came.
The Americans introduced the public schools system to the country which drove literacy rates up. English became the lingua franca in the Philippines. It was only during a brief period in the Japanese occupation of the Philippines that the Japanese were able to teach their language in the Philippines and teach the children their written language.
After World War II, the Philippines had the highest literacy rates in Asia. It nearly achieved universal literacy once again in the 1980s and 1990s. Ever since then, the literacy rate has plummeted only to start regaining a few percentage years back.
The DepEd, CHED, and other academic institutions encourage children to improve literacy skills and knowledge. The government has a program of literacy teaching starting in kindergarten. New reforms are being brought in shifting to a K-12 system which will teach children their regional languages before English, as opposed to the ten-year basic education program which teaches English and Filipino, the country's two official languages, from Grade 1.

==Literacy in the 21st century==

==Economic impact==

Many policy analysts consider literacy rates as a crucial measure of the value of a region's human capital. For example, literate people can be more easily trained than illiterate people - and generally have a higher socioeconomic status;[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.thephonicspage.org/On%20Phonics/profitable.html|title = Phonics. It's Profitable|publisher = The Phonics Page|accessdate = 2007-12-11|ref = harv|postscript = [/tpl] thus they enjoy better health and employment prospects. Literacy increases job opportunities and access to higher education.
Korotayev and coauthors have revealed a rather significant correlation between the level of literacy in the early 19th century and successful modernization and economic breakthroughs in the late 20th century, as "literate people could be characterized by a greater innovative-activity level, which provides opportunities for modernization, development, and economic growth".Korotayev, Andrey; Zinkina, Julia; Bogevolnov, Justislav; Malkov, Artemy. "Global Unconditional Convergence among Larger Economies after 1998?", Journal of Globalization Studies Vol. 2, no. 2, 2011.
In Kerala, India, for example, female and child mortality rates declined dramatically in the 1960s, when girls schooled according to the education reforms after 1948 began to raise families. In addition to the potential for literacy to increase wealth, wealth may promote literacy, through cultural norms and easier access to schools and tutoring services.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]
In 2009, the National Adult Literacy agency (NALA) in Ireland commissioned a cost benefit analysis of adult literacy training. This concluded that there were economic gains for the individuals, the companies they worked for, and the Exchequer, as well as the economy and the country as a whole—for example, increased GDP. The annual income gain per person per level increase on the Irish ten level National Qualifications Framework was €3,810 and the annual gain to the Exchequer, in terms of reduced social welfare transfers and increased tax payments, was €1,531.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nala.ie/sites/default/files/press_release_image-2010-March/files/Policy%20Brief%20on%20Adult%20Literacy%20Strategy%202009.pdf |title=nala.ie |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl]

==Broader and complementary definitions==

Traditionally, literacy is ability to use written language actively and passively; one definition of literacy is the ability to "read, write, spell, listen, and speak".[tpl]Cite book|author=Moats, Louisa |title=Speech to print: language essentials for teachers |publisher=Paul H.

Some have argued that the definition of literacy should be expanded. For example, in the United States, the National Council of Teachers of English and the International Reading Association have added "visually representing"[tpl]clarify|date=July 2012[/tpl] to the traditional list of competencies. Similarly, in Scotland, literacy has been defined as: "The ability to read, write and use numeracy, to handle information, to express ideas and opinions, to make decisions and solve problems, as family members, workers, citizens and lifelong learners"."Adult Literacy and Numeracy in Scotland" (2001)
A basic literacy standard in many places is the ability to read the newspaper. Increasingly, communication in commerce and in general requires the ability to use computers and other digital technologies. Since the 1990s, when the Internet came into wide use in the United States, some have asserted that the definition of literacy should include the ability to use tools such as web browsers, word processing programs, and text messages. Similar expanded skill sets have been called multimedia literacy, computer literacy, information literacy, and technological literacy.[tpl]Cite book|author=Kress, Gunther R. |title=Literacy in the new media age |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-415-25356-X [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/cconline/reviews/charlton/Kress.htm |title=Literacy in the New Media Age |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] Some scholars propose the idea multiliteracies which includes Functional Literacy, Critical Literacy, and Rhetorical Literacy.[tpl]Cite book|author=Stuart Selber |title=Multiliteracies for a Digital Age |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-8093-2551-9 [/tpl]

Other genres under study by academia include critical literacy, media literacy, ecological literacy and health literacyZarcadoolas, C., Pleasant, A., & Greer, D. (2006). Advancing health literacy: A framework for understanding and action. Jossey-Bass: San Francisco, CA. With the increasing emphasis on evidence-based decision making, and the use of statistical graphics and information, statistical literacy is becoming a very important aspect of literacy in general. The International Statistical Literacy Project is dedicated to the promotion of statistical literacy among all members of society.
It is argued that literacy includes the cultural, political, and historical contexts of the community in which communication takes place.Michele Knobel (1999). Everyday Literacies: Students, Discourse, and Social Practice, New York: LangGee, J. P. (1996). Social Linguistics and Literacies: Ideologies in Discourses Philadelphia: Falmer.
Given that a large part of the benefits of literacy can be obtained by having access to a literate person in the household, some recent literature in economics, starting with the work of Kaushik Basu and James Foster, distinguishes between a "proximate illiterate" and an "isolated illiterate". The former refers to an illiterate person who lives in a household with literates and the latter to an illiterate who lives in a household of all illiterates. What is of concern is that many people in poor nations are not just illiterates but isolated illiterates.

==Teaching literacy==

Teaching English literacy in the United States is dominated by a focus on a set of discrete decoding skills. From this perspective, literacy—or, rather, reading—comprises a number of subskills that can be taught to students. These skill sets include phonological awareness, phonics (decoding), fluency, comprehension, and vocabulary. Mastering each of these subskills is necessary for students to become proficient readers.[tpl]Cite journal|author = National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|title = Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and its Implications for Reading Instruction: Reports of the Subgroups|publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office|year = 2000|ref = harv|postscript = [/tpl]
From this same perspective, readers of alphabetic languages must understand the alphabetic principle to master basic reading skills. For this purpose a writing system is "alphabetic" if it uses symbols to represent individual language sounds,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/glossary.html |title=Glossary of Reading Terms - The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |publisher=Sedl.org |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl] though the degree of correspondence between letters and sounds varies between alphabetic languages. Syllabic writing systems (such as Japanese kana) use a symbol to represent a single syllable, and logographic writing systems (such as Chinese) use a symbol to represent a morpheme.[tpl]cite web|author=Paul Halsall |url=http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/chinlng4.html |title=Chinese Cultural Studies: Chinese Logographic Writing |publisher=Acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu |accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl]
There are any number of approaches to teaching literacy; each is shaped by its informing assumptions about what literacy is[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] and how it is best learned by students. Phonics instruction, for example, focuses on reading at the level of the word. It teaches readers to observe and interpret the letters or groups of letters that make up words. A common method of teaching phonics is synthetic phonics, in which a novice reader pronounces each individual sound and "blends" them to pronounce the whole word. Another approach is embedded phonics instruction, used more often in whole language reading instruction, in which novice readers learn about the individual letters in words on a just-in-time, just-in-place basis that is tailored to meet each student's reading and writing learning needs. That is, teachers provide phonics instruction opportunistically, within the context of stories or student writing that feature many instances of a particular letter or group of letters. Embedded instruction combines letter-sound knowledge with the use of meaningful context to read new and difficult words.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/glossary#E |title=Glossary |publisher=LD OnLine |accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl] Techniques such as directed listening and thinking activities can be used to aid children in learning how to read and reading comprehension.
In a 2012 proposal, it has been claimed that reading can be acquired naturally if print is constantly available at an early age in the same manner as spoken language.Massaro, D. W. (2012). "Acquiring Literacy Naturally: Behavioral science and technology could empower preschool children to learn to read naturally without instruction", American Scientist, 100, 324-333. If an appropriate form of written text is made available before formal schooling begins, reading should be learned inductively, emerge naturally, and with no significant negative consequences. This proposal challenges the commonly held belief that written language requires formal instruction and schooling. Its success would change current views of literacy and schooling. Using developments in behavioral science and technology, an interactive system (Technology Assisted Reading Acquisition, TARA) would enable young pre-literate children to accurately perceive and learn properties of written language by simple exposure to the written form.

==Public library efforts to promote literacy==

The public library has long been a force promoting literacy in many countries.[tpl]cite book |title=Introduction to Public Librarianship |author= McCook, Kathleen de la Peña  |year=2011, New York, Neal-Schuman, pp. 58-59. [/tpl] In the United States, the release of the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) report in 2005 revealed that approximately 14% of adults function at the lowest level of literacy; 29% of adults function at the basic functional literacy level and cannot help their children with homework beyond the first few grades.Weibel, M.C. (2007). Adult Learners Welcome Here: A Handbook for Librarians and Literacy Teachers. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., New York. ISBN 1-55570-578-2. The lack of reading skills hinders adults from reaching their full potential. They might have difficulty getting and maintaining a job, providing for their families, or even reading a story to their children. For adults, the library might be the only source of a literacy program.Selnick, S. (2004). County: Changing lives through literacy" Public Libraries, 43(1), p.53-56.
===Child Literacy=== 
Public libraries continue to promote literacy among families, especially toward those with young children. Most public libraries have story time for young children, book clubs for teenagers, and activities and games related to literature. Parental involvement is important aspect for literacy. Parents who read to or encourage reading in their children are responsible for their child's love for reading as he or she gets older.

====April 30====

 Dia! Which stand for Diversity in Action and is also known as "El Dia de los Ninos/El dia de los libros (Children's Day/Book Day)" is a program which celebrates the importance of reading to children from all cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Dia! is celebrated every year on April 30 in schools, libraries, and homes and this website provides tools and programs to encourage reading in children. Parents, caregivers, and educators can even start a book club.

===United States===

The American Library Association promotes literacy through the work of the Office for Literacy and Outreach Services.  This committee’s charge includes ensuring equitable access to information and advocating for adult new and non-readers.http://www.ala.org/offices/olos The Public Library Association recognizes the importance of early childhood in the role of literacy development and created, in collaboration with the Association for Library Service to Children,  Every Child Ready to Read @your library in order to inform and support parents and caregivers in their efforts to raise children who become literate adults.http://www.everychildreadytoread.org/about
Programs have been instituted in public libraries across the United States in an attempt to improve literacy rates. Some examples are listed below.
READ/Orange County, initiated in 1992 by the Orange County Public Library in California, is an example of a flourishing community literacy program. The organization builds on what people have already learned through experience as well as education, rather than trying to make up for what has not been learned. The organization then provides the student with the skills to continue learning in the future. The program operates on the basis that an adult who learns to read creates a ripple effect in the community. An adult who learns to read impacts not just himself but the whole community: he becomes an example to his children and grandchildren, and can better serve his community. The mission of READ/Orange County is to "create a more literate community by providing diversified services of the highest quality to all who seek them." Potential tutors train during an extensive 23-hour tutor training workshop in which they learn the philosophy, techniques and tools they will need to work with adult learns. After the training, the tutors invest at least 50 hours a year to tutoring their student.
Another successful literacy effort is the BoulderReads! program in Boulder, Colorado. The program recognized the difficulty that students had in obtaining child care while attending tutoring sessions, and joined with the University of Colorado to provide reading buddies to the children of students. Reading Buddies matches children of adult literacy students with college students who meet with them once a week throughout the semester for an hour and a half. The college students receive course credit, ensuring the quality and reliability of their time.Sherry, D. (2004). reading buddies for the children of adult literacy students: One way to provide onsite child care while also addressing intergenerational illiteracy" Colorado Libraries, 31(1), p.40-42. Each Reading Buddies session focuses primarily on the college student reading aloud with the child. This helps the child gain interest in books and feel comfortable reading aloud. Time is also spent on word games, writing letters, or searching for books in the library. Throughout the semester the pair work on writing and illustrating a book together. The college student’s grade is partly dependent on the completion of the book. Although Reading Buddies began primarily as an answer to the lack of child care for literacy students, it has evolved into another aspect of the program. While the children are not participants in the tutoring program, they do show marked improvement in their reading and writing skills throughout the semester, due in part to the admiration and respect they gain for their college reading buddy.
The Hillsborough Literacy Council (HLC), operating under the Florida Literacy Coalition, a statewide organization, strives to improve the literacy ability of adults in Hillsborough County, Florida. Working since 1986, the HLC is "committed to improving literacy by empowering adults through education".Hillsborough Literacy Council, 2010. The HLC also provides tutoring for English for speakers of other languages (ESOL). Approximately 120,000 adults in Hillsborough County are illiterate or read below the fourth-grade level. Through one-on-one tutoring, the organization works to help adult students reach at least the fifth-grade level. Approximately 95,000 adults living in Hillsborough County do not speak English; volunteers in the organization typically work with small groups of non-English speaking students to help practice their English conversation skills at any time.
