New York Press was a free alternative weekly in New York City, which was published from 1988 to 2011. During its lifetime, it was the main competitor to The Village Voice. It was originally conceived and published by founder Russ Smith as a conservative voice in a traditionally liberal New York; later it became less political.http://www.observer.com/2011/08/new-york-press-is-dead-long-live-our-town-downtown/
The Press strove to create a rivalry with the Village Voice, and took credit for forcing the Voice into becoming a free paper in 1996, although almost all other alternative weekly newspapers had long since gone that route.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/22/business/media-weeklies-with-free-distribution-village-voice-echoes-its-owner-s-strategy.html | work=The New York Times | first=Andrea | last=Adelson | title=MEDIA: WEEKLIES;With free distribution, The Village Voice echoes its owner's strategy in California. | date=1996-04-22[/tpl] Emulating New York Press's own popular "Best of Manhattan" annual feature, the Village Voice later began publishing its own annual "Best of New York" issue.

==An independent weekly (1988–2002)==

The paper was founded by Russ Smith, who published it until he sold it in late 2002. Smith was assisted throughout this period by John Strausbaugh. Smith wrote a column starting with the first issue, which was published under the pseudonym "MUGGER"; it mostly focused on media coverage of politics, as well as restaurant reviews and personal anecdotes. At some point Smith began running the column under his own name, though still titled "Mugger"; it ran in the New York Press until 2009.
During Smith's editorship, the Press ran regular columns by the radical Alexander Cockburn, the conservative Taki Theodoracopolos, the future Weekly Standard editor Christopher Caldwell, Soul Coughing lead singer Mike Doughty (both under his own name and under the pseudonym "Dirty Sanchez"), Adam Mazmanian, Todd Seavey, Paul Lukas, occultist Alan Cabal,[tpl]cite book |title=Our Gods Wear Spandex: The Secret History of Comic Book Heroes |author=Christopher Knowles |authorlink=Christopher Knowles (comics) |year=2007 |publisher=Weiser Books |location=San Francisco, Calif. |pages=197–198 |isbn=1-57863-406-7 |url= |quote=...New York City, where Franki eats jelly beans with icecream the occult renaissance outlived the Sixties.

Examples include the author and screenwriter William Monahan, author Dave Eggers, future Weekly Standard and Humanities magazine editor David Skinner, author and raconteur Toby Young, New York magazine contributing editor and author Amy Sohn, author Jonathan Ames, theater critic Jonathan Kalb (two-time winner of the George Jean Nathan Award for Dramatic Criticism), author Ben Greenman, faux-memoirist "JT LeRoy", American Conservative magazine editor Scott McConnell, writer Kevin R. Kosar, future New York Times editor Sam Sifton, and Mother Jones Washington Bureau Chief and novelist David Corn, among others.
According to writer Jim Knipfel, the "Golden Age of the Press" occurred in the years 1996 and 1997, and that "between 1995 and 2000, there was nothing like Press anyplace". He describes the NYPress as "a ratty, underground version of those early years at Esquire".Who Walk In Brooklyn » Blog Archive » Jim Knipfel: A Swell Looking Babe

Wartella, Gary Panter, Danny Hellman, Tony Millionaire and others. Ballpoint pen artist Lennie Mace was also among the regular contributing illustrators.

Immediately after the sale, Strausbaugh was fired. After an interim editor declined to stay on, Jeff Koyen was hired away from The Prague Pill. From 2003 to 2005, as editor-in-chief, Koyen continued publishing approximately 100 pages each week. From 2007 onward, it ran at less than 40 pages each week.
From April 2003 to July 2004, the Press had a sister publication, New York Sports Express, that was a free weekly devoted to sports. The publishers discontinued it.

Harry Siegel became the paper's editor in August 2005, bringing along with him three editors and writers (Tim Marchman, Jonathan Leaf and Azi Paybarah), and giving the Press a greater focus on local politics. In February 2006 all four resigned from the paper, after the publisher rejected a planned cover story that would have shown the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons.http://thepoliticker.observer.com/2006/02/ny-press-kills-cartoons-staff-walks-out.html Siegel was replaced for a short time by Steve Weinstein, former editor of the New York Blade. In 2006, Adario Strange, former editor of The Source, became the new editor. A year later, in 2007, Strange left the paper to return to film directing. After his promotion to publisher, Nick Thomas named former arts and entertainment editor Jerry Portwood to editor of the publication.
On July 31, 2007, the paper was acquired by Manhattan Media, the owner of Avenue magazine and a small stable of New York community weekly newspapers. One of those weeklies, Our Town Downtown, was initially merged with the New York Press, but was revived as the Press' replacement in August 2011.
