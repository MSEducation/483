[[Moving to Blackwater]]

CATEGORIES: 2004 singles, Reuben songs

"Moving to Blackwater" is the sixth single by Surrey-based rock band Reuben, and the third single taken from their debut album, Racecar Is Racecar Backwards. It was released in August 2004, and was also the first single that Reuben had ever released in the wake of an album. Opinion was divided as to whether or not it was the right choice to follow "Freddy Kreuger", some[tpl]Who|date=March 2009[/tpl] saying that the band should have released a more immediate single, and some arguing that it was a strong song that ably demonstrated another side of the band's diversity. It received only a small number of plays on radio, and even fewer showings on TV. In spite of this, the single still managed to reach #59 in the UK singles chart, only six places down from its predecessor. It was released on CD and 7" vinyl format, with a special alternative B-side on the vinyl copies.
