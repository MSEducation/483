[[Games played with Go equipment]]

CATEGORIES: Go (game), Abstract strategy games

Many games can be played with Go equipment: a supply of white and black stones and a board with 19×19 intersections, other than Go and many more can be played with minor modification.
Games that can be played without modification on the intersections of a 19×19 Go board include:
Games that can be played without modification on the intersections of a Go board reduced in size (perhaps by masking the unwanted sections with paper or tape) include:
Games that can be played without modification on the squares of a Go board reduced in size include:
It's also possible to use Go equipment as a low-tech interface to Conway's Game of Life; use black stones in the board's squares as 'pixels', and for each generation use white stones to indicate where new cells will be born. Then remove 'dead' black stones, replace the white stones with black ones to complete the new generation, and repeat the process.
