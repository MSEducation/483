</ref> In general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements,<ref group="n">While fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements under the [[Pauling scale]], [[neon]] is the most electronegative element under other scales, such as the [[Allen scale]].</ref> while [[caesium]] is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.<ref name="Greenwood30">Greenwood, p. 30</ref>
There are some exceptions to this general rule. Gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon respectively because of the d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity. The anomalously high electronegativity of lead, particularly when compared to thallium and bismuth, appears to be an artifact of data selection (and data availability)—methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements.[tpl]cite journal |last=Allred |first=A.

===Electron affinity===

The electron affinity of an atom is the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although electron affinity varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive electron affinity values than metals. Chlorine most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively, so they may or may not have slightly negative values.Chang, pp. 307–309
Electron affinity generally increases across a period. This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and is therefore more stable.
A trend of decreasing electron affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital farther away from the nucleus. As such this electron would be less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, this is due to the poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.Huheey, Keiter & Keiter, pp. 42, 880–81

===Metallic character===

The lower the values of ionization energy, electronegativity and electron affinity, the more metallic character the element has. Conversely, nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties.[tpl]cite book |last1=Yoder |first1=C. H.|last2=Suydam|first2= F. H.|last3=Snavely|first3=F. A. |year=1975 |title=Chemistry |page=58 |edition=2nd |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |isbn=0-15-506465-7[/tpl] Given the periodic trends of these three properties, metallic character tends to decrease going across a period (or row) and, with some irregularities (mostly) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons, and relativistic effects,Huheey, Keiter & Keiter, pp. 880–85 tends to increase going down a group (or column or family). Thus, the most metallic elements (such as caesium and francium) are found at the bottom left of traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements (oxygen, fluorine, chlorine) at the top right. The combination of horizontal and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair-shaped dividing line between metals and nonmetals found on some periodic tables, and the practice of sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line, or elements adjacent to those elements, as metalloids.[tpl]cite book |last=Sacks|first=O|title=Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a chemical boyhood|year=2009|publisher=Alfred A.

==History==

===First systemization attempts===

In 1789, Antoine Lavoisier published a list of 33 chemical elements, grouping them into gases, metals, nonmetals, and earths;[tpl]cite book |title=From elements to atoms: a history of chemical composition |last=Siegfried |first=Robert |year=2002 |page=92 |publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data |isbn=0-87169-924-9 |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania[/tpl] Chemists spent the following century searching for a more precise classification scheme. In 1829, Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner observed that many of the elements could be grouped into triads based on their chemical properties. Lithium, sodium, and potassium, for example, were grouped together in a triad as soft, reactive metals. Döbereiner also observed that, when arranged by atomic weight, the second member of each triad was roughly the average of the first and the third;Ball, p. 100 this became known as the Law of Triads.[tpl]cite book |last=Horvitz |first=Leslie |title=Eureka!: Scientific Breakthroughs That Changed The World |year=2002 |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-23341-1 |oclc=50766822 |page=43[/tpl] German chemist Leopold Gmelin worked with this system, and by 1843 he had identified ten triads, three groups of four, and one group of five. Jean-Baptiste Dumas published work in 1857 describing relationships between various groups of metals. Although various chemists were able to identify relationships between small groups of elements, they had yet to build one scheme that encompassed them all.
In 1858, German chemist August Kekulé observed that carbon often has four other atoms bonded to it. Methane, for example, has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. This concept eventually became known as valency; different elements bond with different numbers of atoms.[tpl]cite book |last=van Spronsen|first=J. W.|title=The periodic system of chemical elements|year=1969|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0-444-40776-6|page=19[/tpl]
In 1862, Alexandre-Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois, a French geologist, published an early form of periodic table, which he called the telluric helix or screw. He was the first person to notice the periodicity of the elements. With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight, de Chancourtois showed that elements with similar properties seemed to occur at regular intervals. His chart included some ions and compounds in addition to elements. His paper also used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include a diagram; as a result, it received little attention until the work of Dmitri Mendeleev.Annales des Mines history page.
In 1864, Julius Lothar Meyer, a German chemist, published a table with 44 elements arranged by valency. The table showed that elements with similar properties often shared the same valency.Venable, pp. 85–86; 97 Concurrently, William Odling (an English chemist) published an arrangement of 57 elements, ordered on the basis of their atomic weights. With some irregularities and gaps, he noticed what appeared to be a periodicity of atomic weights amongst the elements and that this accorded with 'their usually received groupings.' [tpl]cite journal |last=Odling |first=W.|title=On the proportional numbers of the elements|journal=Quarterly Journal of Science|year=2002 |volume=1|pages=642–648 (643)[/tpl] Odling alluded to the idea of a periodic law but did not pursue it.[tpl]cite book |last=Scerri|first=Eric R.|title=The periodic table: A very short introduction|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-958249-5[/tpl] He subsequently proposed (in 1870) a valence-based classification of the elements.[tpl]cite book |last=Kaji |first=M. |editor1-first=D.

English chemist John Newlands produced a series of papers from 1863 to 1866 noting that when the elements were listed in order of increasing atomic weight, similar physical and chemical properties recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music.[tpl]cite journal |title = On Relations Among the Equivalents |author = Newlands, John A.

In 1867, Gustavus Hinrichs, a Danish born academic chemist based in America, published a spiral periodic system based on atomic spectra and weights, and chemical similarities. His work was regarded as idiosyncratic, ostentatious and labyrinthine and this may have militated against its recognition and acceptance.Scerri 2007, pp. 87, 92[tpl]cite journal | title =American forerunners of the periodic law | last =Kauffman | first = George B. |journal = Journal of Chemical Education | date=March 1969 | pages = 128–135 (132)|volume=46|issue=3|doi = 10.1021/ed046p128|bibcode = 1969JChEd..46..128K [/tpl]

===Mendeleev's table===

Russian chemistry professor Dmitri Mendeleev and German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer independently published their periodic tables in 1869 and 1870, respectively.[tpl]cite journal|last=Mendelejew |first=Dimitri |year=1869 |title=Über die Beziehungen der Eigenschaften zu den Atomgewichten der Elemente |journal=Zeitschrift für Chemie |pages=405–406 |language=German[/tpl] Mendeleev's table was his first published version; that of Meyer was an expanded version of his (Meyer's) table of 1864.Venable, pp. 96–97; 100–102 They both constructed their tables by listing the elements in rows or columns in order of atomic weight and starting a new row or column when the characteristics of the elements began to repeat.Ball, pp. 100–102
The recognition and acceptance afforded to Mendeleev's table came from two decisions he made. The first was to leave gaps in the table when it seemed that the corresponding element had not yet been discovered.[tpl]cite book |author=Pullman, Bernard |title=The Atom in the History of Human Thought |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |page=227 |isbn=0-19-515040-6|others=Translated by Axel Reisinger[/tpl] Mendeleev was not the first chemist to do so, but he was the first to be recognized as using the trends in his periodic table to predict the properties of those missing elements, such as gallium and germanium.Ball, p. 105 The second decision was to occasionally ignore the order suggested by the atomic weights and switch adjacent elements, such as tellurium and iodine, to better classify them into chemical families. With the development of theories of atomic structure, it became apparent that Mendeleev had unintentionally listed the elements in order of increasing atomic number or nuclear charge.[tpl]cite book |title=The Periodic Kingdom |author=Atkins, P. W. |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers, Inc. |year=1995 |page=87|isbn=0-465-07265-8[/tpl]
The significance of atomic numbers to the organization of the periodic table was not appreciated until the existence and properties of protons and neutrons became understood. Mendeleev's periodic tables used atomic weight instead of atomic number to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time. Atomic weight worked well enough in most cases to (as noted) give a presentation that was able to predict the properties of missing elements more accurately than any other method then known. Substitution of atomic numbers, once understood, gave a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements, still used today even as new synthetic elements are being produced and studied.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Nucl. Phys. A|volume=789|pages=142–154|year=2007|title=Predictions of alpha decay half lives of heavy and superheavy elements|last1=Samanta|first1=C.|last2=Chowdhury|first2=P.

===Further development===

In 1871, Mendeleev published a form of periodic table, with groups of similar elements arranged in columns from I to VIII (as shown). He also gave detailed predictions for the properties of elements he had earlier noted were missing, but should exist.Scerri 2007, p. 112 These gaps were subsequently filled as chemists discovered additional naturally occurring elements.[tpl]cite journal |last=Kaji |first=Masanori |year=2002 |title=D.I.

M. |volume = 234 |bibcode = 1971Natur.234..132H|issue=5325[/tpl] and by 2011 it was known that all the elements up to californium can occur naturally as trace amounts in uranium ores by neutron capture and beta decay.
The popularGray, p.  12 periodic table layout, also known as the common or standard form (as shown at various other points in this article), is attributable to Horace Groves Deming. In 1923, Deming, an American chemist, published short (Mendeleev style) and medium (18-column) form periodic tables.[tpl]cite book |last=Deming|first=Horace G|title=General chemistry: An elementary survey|year=1923 |publisher=J. Wiley & Sons |location=New York |pages =160, 165[/tpl]An antecedent of Deming's 18-column table may be seen in Adams' 16-column Periodic Table of 1911. Adams omits the rare earths and the 'radioactive elements' (i.e. the actinides) from the main body of his table and instead shows them as being 'careted in only to save space' (rare earths between Ba and eka-Yt; radioactive elements between eka-Te and eka-I). See: Elliot Q. A. (1911). "A modification of the periodic table". Journal of the American Chemical Society. 33(5): 684–688 (687). Merck and Company prepared a handout form of Deming's 18-column medium table, in 1928, which was widely circulated in American schools. By the 1930s Deming's table was appearing in handbooks and encyclopaedias of chemistry. It was also distributed for many years by the Sargent-Welch Scientific Company.[tpl]cite book |last1=Abraham|first1=M|last2=Coshow|first2=D|last3=Fix|first3=W|title=Periodicity:A source book module, version 1.0|publisher=Chemsource, Inc.|location=New York|page=3|url=http://dwb4.unl.edu/chem_source_pdf/PERD.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Emsley|first=J|title=Mendeleyev's dream table|journal=New Scientist|date=7 March 1985|pages=32–36(36)[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Fluck|first=E|year=1988|title=New notations in the period table|journal=Pure & Applied Chemistry|volume=60|issue= 3|pages=431–436 (432)|doi=10.1351/pac198860030431[/tpl]
With the development of modern quantum mechanical theories of electron configurations within atoms, it became apparent that each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons. Larger atoms have more electron sub-shells, so later tables have required progressively longer periods.Ball, p. 111
In 1945, Glenn Seaborg, an American scientist, made the suggestion that the actinide elements, like the lanthanides were filling an f sub-level. Before this time the actinides were thought to be forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career. As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's suggestion was found to be correct and he subsequently went on to win the 1951 Nobel prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements.Scerri 2007, pp. 270‒71[tpl]cite book |last1=Masterton|first1=William L. |last2=Hurley|first2=Cecile N.|last3=Neth|first3=Edward J.|title=Chemistry: Principles and reactions|publisher=Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|edition=7th|isbn=1-111-42710-0|page=173[/tpl]A second extra-long periodic table row, to accommodate known and undiscovered elements with an atomic weight greater than bismuth (thorium, protactinium and uranium, for example), had been postulated as far back as 1892. Most investigators, however, considered that these elements were analogues of the third series transition elements, hafnium, tantalum and tungsten. The existence of a second inner transition series, in the form of the actinides, was not accepted until similarities with the electron structures of the lanthanides had been established. See: van Spronsen, J. W. (1969). The periodic system of chemical elements. Amsterdam: Elsevier. p. 315–316, ISBN 0-444-40776-6.
Although minute quantities of some transuranic elements occur naturally, they were all first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, the first of these being neptunium, synthesized in 1939.Ball, p. 123 Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. The most recently accepted and named elements are flerovium (element 114) and livermorium (element 116), both named on 31 May 2012.[tpl]cite journal |author=Barber, Robert C.; Karol, Paul J; Nakahara, Hiromichi; Vardaci, Emanuele; Vogt, Erich W. |title=Discovery of the elements with atomic numbers greater than or equal to 113 (IUPAC Technical Report) |doi=10.1351/PAC-REP-10-05-01 |journal=Pure Appl.

==Alternative layouts==

There are many periodic tables with layouts other than that of the common or standard form. Within 100 years of the appearance of Mendeleev's table in 1869 it has been estimated that around 700 different periodic table versions were published.Scerri 2007, p. 20 As well as numerous rectangular variations, other periodic table formats have included, for example,See The Internet database of periodic tables for depictions of these kinds of variants. circular, cubic, cylindrical, edificial (building-like), helical, lemniscate, octagonal prismatic, pyramidal, separated, spherical, spiral, and triangular forms. Such alternatives are often developed to highlight or emphasize chemical or physical properties of the elements that are not as apparent in traditional periodic tables.

The various forms of periodic tables can be thought of as lying on a chemistry–physics continuum.Scerri 2007, pp. 285‒86 Towards the chemistry end of the continuum can be found, as an example, Rayner-Canham's 'unruly'Scerri 2007, p. 285 Inorganic Chemist's Periodic Table (2002),[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook/35_pt/pt_database.php?PT_id=429|title=2002 Inorganic Chemist's Periodic Table|author=Mark R.

==Open questions and controversies==

===Elements with unknown chemical properties===

Although all elements up to ununoctium have been discovered, only elements up to hassium (element 108), along with copernicium (element 112), have known chemical properties. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, even though it is currently placed in the carbon group.[tpl]cite book|title=The Chemistry of Superheavy Elements|last=Schändel|first=Matthias|year=2003|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht|isbn=1-4020-1250-0|page=277[/tpl] More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.Scerri 2011, pp. 142–143

===Further periodic table extensions===

It is unclear whether new elements will continue the pattern of the current periodic table as period 8, or require further adaptations or adjustments. Seaborg expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly, so that it would include a two-element s-block for elements 119 and 120, a new g-block for the next 18 elements, and 30 additional elements continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.2307/3963006|last=Frazier|first=K.|title=Superheavy Elements|journal=Science News|volume=113|issue=15|pages=236–238|year=1978|jstor=3963006[/tpl] More recently, physicists such as Pekka Pyykkö have theorized that these additional elements do not follow the Madelung rule, which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table.[tpl]Cite journal|last1=Pyykkö|first1=Pekka|authorlink=Pekka Pyykkö|title=A suggested periodic table up to Z ≤ 172, based on Dirac–Fock calculations on atoms and ions|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=161–168|year=2011|pmid=20967377|doi=10.1039/c0cp01575j|bibcode = 2011PCCP...13..161P[/tpl]

===Element with the highest possible atomic number===

The number of possible elements is not known. A very early suggestion made by Elliot Adams in 1911, and based on the arrangement of elements in each horizontal periodic table row, was that elements of atomic weight greater than 256± (which would equate to between elements 99 and 100 in modern-day terms) did not exist.[tpl]cite journal |last=Elliot|first=Q.

See: Karol P. J. (2002). "The Mendeleev–Seaborg periodic table: Through Z = 1138 and beyond". Journal of Chemical Education 79 (1): 60–63.
The Bohr model exhibits difficulty for atoms with atomic number greater than 137, as any element with an atomic number greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be traveling faster than c, the speed of light. Hence the non-relativistic Bohr model is inaccurate when applied to such an element.
The relativistic Dirac equation has problems for elements with more than 137 protons. For such elements, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, and there is no gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the Klein paradox. More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds the limit for elements with more than 173 protons. For heavier elements, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the spontaneous emission of a positron;[ref]

, and references therein.[/ref] however, this does not happen if the innermost orbital is filled, so that element 173 is not necessarily the end of the periodic table.[tpl]cite web|last=Ball |first=Philip |url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2010/November/ColumnThecrucible.asp |title=Would Element 137 Really Spell the End of the Periodic Table?

===Placement of hydrogen and helium===

Hydrogen and helium are often placed in different places than their electron configurations would indicate; hydrogen is usually placed above lithium, in accordance with its electron configuration, but is sometimes placed above fluorine, or even carbon,[tpl]cite journal |last=Cronyn |first=Marshall W. |title=The Proper Place for Hydrogen in the Periodic Table |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=80 |issue=8 |date=August 2003 |pages=947–951|bibcode = 2003JChEd..80..947C |doi = 10.1021/ed080p947 [/tpl] as it also behaves somewhat similarly to them. Hydrogen is also sometimes placed in its own group, as it does not behave similarly enough to any element to be placed in a group with another.Gray, p. 14 Helium is almost always placed above neon, as they are very similar chemically, although it is occasionally placed above beryllium on account of having a comparable electron shell configuration (helium: 1s2; beryllium: He 2s2).Gray, p. 12

===Groups included in the transition metals===

The definition of a transition metal, as given by IUPAC, is an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell.[tpl]GoldBookRef|file=T06456|title=transition element[/tpl] By this definition all of the elements in groups 3–11 are transition metals. The IUPAC definition therefore excludes group 12, comprising zinc, cadmium and mercury, from the transition metals category.
Some chemists treat the categories "d-block elements" and "transition metals" interchangeably, thereby including groups 3–12 among the transition metals. In this instance the group 12 elements are treated as a special case of transition metal in which the d electrons are not ordinarily involved in chemical bonding. The recent discovery that mercury can use its d electrons in the formation of mercury(IV) fluoride (HgF4) has prompted some commentators to suggest that mercury can be regarded as a transition metal.[tpl]cite journal |author1=Xuefang Wang |author2=Lester Andrews|author3=Sebastian Riedel|author4=Martin Kaupp |title=Mercury Is a Transition Metal: The First Experimental Evidence for HgF4 |journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. |year=2007 |volume=46 |issue=44 |pages=8371–8375 |doi=10.1002/anie.200703710 |pmid=17899620[/tpl] Other commentators, such as Jensen,[tpl]cite journal |title=Is Mercury Now a Transition Element? |author=William B. Jensen |journal=J. Chem. Educ. |year=2008 |volume=85 |pages=1182–1183 |doi=10.1021/ed085p1182|bibcode = 2008JChEd..85.1182J |issue=9 [/tpl] have argued that the formation of a compound like HgF4 can occur only under highly abnormal conditions. As such, mercury could not be regarded as a transition metal by any reasonable interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the term.
Still other chemists further exclude the group 3 elements from the definition of a transition metal. They do so on the basis that the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic of transition metal chemistry.[tpl]cite book |last1=Rayner-Canham|first1=G|last2=Overton|first2=T|title=Descriptive inorganic chemistry|publisher=W H Freeman|pages=484–485|location=New York|edition=4th|isbn=0-7167-8963-9[/tpl] In this case, only groups 4–11 are regarded as transition metals.

===Period 6 and 7 elements in group 3===

Although scandium and yttrium are always the first two group 3 elements, the identity of the next two elements is not agreed upon; they are either lanthanum and actinium, or lutetium and lawrencium. Although there are some strong physical and chemical arguments supporting the latter arrangement not all authors are convinced.[tpl]cite journal|last=Scerri|first=E|year=2012|journal=Chemistry International|volume=34|issue= 4|url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2012/3404/ud.html|title=Mendeleev's Periodic Table Is Finally Completed and What To Do about Group 3?[/tpl] The current IUPAC definition of the term "lanthanoid" includes fifteen elements including both lanthanum and lutetium, and that of "transition element" applies to lanthanum and actinium, as well as lutetium but not lawrencium, since it does not correctly follow the Aufbau principle. Normally, the 103rd electron would enter the d-subshell, but quantum mechanical research has found that the configuration is actually Rn7s25f147p1The expected configuration of lawrencium if it did obey the Aufbau principle would be Rn7s25f146d1, with the normal incomplete 6d-subshell in the neutral state. due to relativistic effects.[tpl]cite journal |last = Eliav|first = E.|last2=Kaldor|first2=U.|last2=Ishikawa|first2=Y. |title = Transition energies of ytterbium, lutetium, and lawrencium by the relativistic coupled-cluster method |journal = Phys. Rev. A|volume = 52|pages = 291–296 |year = 1995 |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.52.291|bibcode = 1995PhRvA..52..291E [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last = Zou|first = Yu|last2=Froese|first2=Fischer C. |title = Resonance Transition Energies and Oscillator Strengths in Lutetium and Lawrencium|journal = Phys.

===Optimal form===

The many different forms of periodic table have prompted the question of whether there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table. The answer to this question is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the many different forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements.Scerri, one of the foremost authorities on the history of the periodic table (Sella 2013), favoured the concept of an optimal form of periodic table but has recently changed his mind and now supports the value of a plurality of periodic tables. See: Sella A. (2013). 'An elementary history lesson'. New Scientist. 2929, August 13th: 51, accessed September 4th 2013; and Scerri, E. (2013). 'Is there an optimal periodic table and other bigger questions in the philosophy of science.'. August 9th, accessed September 4th, 2013. The ubiquity of the standard or medium-long periodic table is thought to be a result of this layout having a good balance of features in terms of ease of construction and size, and its depiction of atomic order and periodic trends.[tpl]cite journal |last=Francl |first=Michelle |title=Table manners |journal=Nature Chemistry |volume=1 |date=May 2009|pages=97–98|url=http://ericscerri.com/Michelle-Nat%20Chem.pdf|bibcode = 2009NatCh...1...97F |doi = 10.1038/nchem.183 |issue=2 |pmid=21378810 [/tpl]
