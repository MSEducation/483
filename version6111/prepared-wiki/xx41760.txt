==History==

===Early career: 1979–84===

Paul Oakenfold describes his early life as a "bedroom DJ" in a podcasted interview with Vancouver's 24 Hours, stating he grew up listening to The Beatles. Later 21-year-old Oakenfold and Ian Paul moved to 254 West 54th Street. Studio 54's Steve Rubell ran the place and only allowed popular people inside. Oakenfold and Paul used fake passes to sneak into places in New York where they met Maze, Bobby Womack and Bob Marley, whom they also interviewed, claiming to be NME and Melody Maker journalists.[tpl]cite web |deadurl=http://www.ministryofsound.com/News/Features/20071108_oakenfold1.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071112103400/http://www.ministryofsound.com/News/Features/20071108_oakenfold1.htm|archivedate=12 November 2007|title=Oakenfold – Blagging it at Studio 54, Extract from Paul Oakenfold: The Authorised Biography |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=Ministry of Sound|url=http://www.ministryofsound.com/News/Features/20071108_oakenfold1.htm[/tpl]
Oakenfold's musical career began in the late 1970s, when he started playing soul in a Covent Garden wine bar. Here, he met Trevor Fung as well as Rumours in London where he played Earth, Wind and Fire and popular British bands.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pauloakenfold/articles/story/5932383/paul_oakenfold_goes_hollywood |title=Paul Oakenfold Goes Hollywood |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=Rolling Stone[/tpl] In 1984, he spent several months in New York City's West Harlem. During this time hip-hop was the most popular sound in the area (see 1984 in music). He began breaking into the mainstream as he was working as an A&R man for Champion Records. At that time, he signed DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, as well as Salt-n-Pepa. Oakenfold appeared on the Blue Peter BBC programme for children with a breakdancing crew. He became a promoter and British agent for the Beastie Boys and Run-D.M.C.. Since then, he appeared at The Project in Streatham playing soul and jazz music.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C |title=Paul Oakenfold Biography |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=Sing 365[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-288173-bio--Paul-Oakenfold |title=Paul Oakenfold Biography |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=Yahoo Music[/tpl]

===Perfecto Records and fame: 1985–91===

In 1987, Oakenfold travelled to the island of Ibiza for a week to celebrate his birthday. Trevor Fung, Nicky Holloway, Ian Saint Paul, Danny Rampling and Johnny Walker accompanied him. Oakenfold convinced the owner of a venue in England to host an "Ibiza Reunion" party after-hours. He had previously made an attempt, but it failed as the crowd was not prepared for the acid house style until 1987 when the party was successful. Since then, the night became a classic and became one of the UK's major acid house nights, known as "Spectrum at Heaven in Charing Cross". Spectrum became popular in The Sanctuary. As a bigger space was required, it turned into the Heaven club, which was run by Oakenfold and Paul. The party was best known for the "Theatre of Madness", as more than 1,500 people were present on Monday nights, until it went down; with the financial issues it changed its name to the "Land of Oz". Artists like Alex Paterson DJ'd in the VIP chillout area known as the "White Room", which gave Oakenfold more free time, and then he began producing music under the alias "Electra" in 1988. Members included Nick Divaris, John "Johnny" Rocca and Micky. Also in 1988 he decided to create a place where new artists could develop their careers. At that moment, Perfecto Records was born.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.perfectorecords.com/ |title=About Perfecto |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=Perfecto Records[/tpl]
He collaborated with his friend Steve Osborne on various projects. In 1990, he worked with Terry Farley, Andrew Weatherall and Osborne on two remixes for Happy Mondays. The remixes of "Rave On" and "Hallelujah" were released on the Madchester Rave On EP, as well as "Step On", a covered version adapted from John Kongos' 1971 hit "He's Gonna Step On You". The song reached the Top 5 position in the UK.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] He was invited as a guest DJ to Spike Island, a gig with The Stone Roses. Pleased with the last single, the Happy Mondays gave Oakenfold and Osborne the opportunity to produce their third studio album, Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/release/161904 |title=Happy Mondays – Pills 'N Thrills And Bellyaches |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=Discogs[/tpl] The album entered the UK charts at #1 with pre-sales of 150,000. The album was named NME's "1990 Album of The Year", and both Oakenfold and Osborne won the 1991 Brit Award for "Best Producer".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pills-n-thrills.com/happy-mondays-biography.html |title=Happy Mondays – Pills 'N Thrills And Bellyaches |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=Discogs[/tpl]
As they continued releasing only four singles as Electra, in Full Frequency Range Recordings (FFRR) founded and run by Radio 1's Pete Tong, the duo created a new alias under the name Perfecto. They remixed Massive Attack's "Safe From Harm" as well as many others.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Perfecto |title=Perfecto |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=Discogs[/tpl] Grace was formed in the late 1990s, consisting of Oakenfold and Osborne and various singers, including jazz singer Dominique Atkins and Patti Low.

===Tours and nightclubs: 1992–2000===

In 1992, when U2 released their song "Even Better Than the Real Thing", the Perfecto remix reached a higher charted position than the original song. In 1993 with the success of his last remix as Perfecto, he was hired by U2 to provide the warm-up sonics to their Zoo TV world tour, and  replaced BP Fallon on the 1993 legs in Europe and Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, with more than fifty shows in Zooropa '93 and Zoomerang from 7 May to 10 December of the same year.
 "There's no chance whatsoever. Seb Fontaine is our resident and is contracted until the end of the year. Paul will be doing some dates and playing Creamfields but that's it. I think his reason to leave (Home) had more to do with increased demands on his time in the US."   — said a spokesperson from Cream to nme.com.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/paul-oakenfold/3316 |title=Oakenfold's Not Going Back Home! |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=NME[/tpl]
  

 "The reason he left was simply because he had so much on this summer and he felt it wouldn't have been fair to play one week and not the other." <p style="text-align: right;"> — <small>added an Oakenfold spokesperson.</small><ref name="notgoing" />

 "I disagreed with the way the club was going and it's time to move on." <p style="text-align: right;"> — <small>responded Paul Oakenfold.</small><ref name="backinfold">[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/paul-oakenfold/3949 |title=Back In The Fold! |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=NME[/tpl]</ref> </blockquote>
He began producing his own tracks as well, continuing to remix songs from popular artists.  He began using Goa music, something he discovered on the beaches of Goa in India, fusing it with similar sounding European tracks to create his own distinct sound. He took this to the mainstream in 1994 and created a pair of two-hour sets for BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix the first of these was broadcast in the early hours of Sunday 20 March 1994, with the second being the legendary "Goa Mix" broadcast on Sunday 18 December 1994.  In 1995, he became the first DJ to play on the main stage at the Glastonbury Festival for 90,000 people, which he considers his favorite gig.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ministryofsound.com/news/features/20071108_oakenfoldinterview |title=Paul Oakenfold Interview |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=Ministry of Sound[/tpl] His album Perfecto Fluoro became the #1 essential dance collection of Boston Beat during 1996 with Jamiroquai's Travelling Without Moving. The group Grace dissolved in 1997 as Oakenfold was touring as a performance DJ more frequently and could not commit to recording.
On 9 June 1997 Oakenfold created Global Underground 004: Paul Oakenfold, Live in Oslo (GU004) which is a double mix CD in the Global Underground series, compiled and mixed by Oakenfold; it is the first work he created for GU. The mix was recorded live at Cosmopolite Club in Oslo, Norway, as part of the official launch of the Quart Festival. It showcases Oakenfold's eclectic taste in music at the time, as the mix combines various forms of dance music.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/release/36480 |title=Paul Oakenfold – Global Underground: Live In Oslo |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=Discogs[/tpl] In 1997, Oakenfold mixed one disc of the double album Fantazia Presents the House Collection 6, a UK house music compilation series.

In 1998 and 1999, Oakenfold took the first place in "DJmag's Top 100 DJs". With the two-year contract as a resident in Liverpool's Cream, it was in 1999 that he released Resident. Two Years of Oakenfold at Cream. on Virgin. Thrive Records, the US distributor for early Global Underground releases had a different numbering scheme for the Global Underground albums, due to this Global Underground 007: Paul Oakenfold, New York (GU007) was released as (GU002) in the United States only. The compilation was released on 25 May 1998, with the US release on 19 January 1999. This was the second production from Oakenfold with GU and it contained trance, drum and bass, progressive house, progressive trance, breakbeat and Downtempo. This became his last work with GU.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]

===Pioneer in America: 2000–01===

After his success in Europe, one of Oakenfold's first major events in America was Fresno, California's Cyberfest on 22 July 2000. The 500 acre indoor and outdoor central California location had the biggest dance capacity ever in America. An estimated 80,000 dancers and music lovers from Seattle, Reno, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Diego were welcomed that day. Cyberfest 2000, also known as the "Festival Of The Future" featured other DJs such as Chemical Brothers, BT, and Carl Cox. Cyberfest 2000 paved the way for other major events in the area such as the Electric Daisy Carnival in Los Angeles in 2010.
In 2001, Oakenfold took part in the first Area Festival tour. This tour featured Incubus, Carl Cox, The Orb, OutKast, and The Roots. He later released a new compilation album, Perfecto Presents: Ibiza.

Global Underground sold over 150,000 copies of Oakenfold's previous Global Underground: New York. A spokesperson for the label claimed that in the US, demand for UK dance music had been increasing in the past couple of years, and now made up over two-thirds of the label's sales. The Global Underground New York office opened in on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/paul-oakenfold/7788 |title=Boxed Takes Bite of Big Apple |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=NME[/tpl] The Mekka Electronic Music Festival, otherwise known as the "electronic Lollapallooza" took place in ten cities in the US and Canada during August and September, including New York, Los Angeles, Toronto and San Francisco.

 "I'm a big fan of Nelly Furtado and she's on the record. She's got this wonderful way about her, she's extremely talented and a great vocalist. Most of all she's good fun, she doesn't take it as seriously as some people do."
 "I'd always wanted to do something that represented by own musical background... I grew up on pop music, I love guitar bands and I was very influenced and involved in hip-hop during the early days, so I wanted to build from those roots upwards rather than doing a contemporary dance record."  — said Paul Oakenfold on several interviews.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/paul-oakenfold/9801 |title=Oakey Ropes In Some Blokies! |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=NME[/tpl]

 "I've done so many remixes from the likes of the Rolling Stones to Snoop Dogg etc, but you can only get a certain amount on the CD. It was difficult for me but I had to choose what I wanted and what I felt were the best mixes that showcased my art in the best way."  —  said Oakenfold.
