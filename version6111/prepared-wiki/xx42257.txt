Saint Patrick's Day, or the Feast of Saint Patrick ([tpl]lang-ga|Lá Fhéile Pádraig[/tpl], "the Day of the Festival of Patrick"), is a cultural and religious holiday celebrated annually on 17 March, the death date of the most commonly-recognised patron saint of Ireland, Saint Patrick ([tpl]circa[/tpl] AD 385–461).
Saint Patrick's Day was made an official Christian feast day in the early seventeenth century and is observed by the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion (especially the Church of Ireland),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ireland.anglican.org/index.php?do=news&newsid=3496 |title="St Patrick's Day celebrations".

==Saint Patrick==

Much of what is known about St Patrick comes from the Declaration, which was allegedly written by Patrick himself. It is believed that he was born in Roman Britain in the fourth century, into a wealthy Romano-British family. His father was a deacon and his grandfather was a priest in the Christian church. According to the Declaration, at the age of sixteen, he was kidnapped by Irish raiders and taken as a slave to Gaelic Ireland.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/patrick/confession.ii.html |title=Confession of St. Patrick |publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library at Calvin College |accessdate=10 March 2010[/tpl] It says that he spent six years there working as a shepherd and that during this time he "found God". The Declaration says that God told Patrick to flee to the coast, where a ship would be waiting to take him home. After making his way home, Patrick went on to become a priest.
According to tradition, Patrick returned to Ireland to convert the pagan Irish to Christianity. The Declaration says that he spent many years evangelising in the northern half of Ireland and converted "thousands". Tradition holds that he died on 17 March and was buried at Downpatrick. Over the following centuries, many legends grew up around Patrick and he became Ireland's foremost saint.

==Celebration and traditions==

===Wearing of the green===

On St Patrick's Day it is customary to wear shamrocks and/or green clothing or accessories (the "wearing of the green"). St Patrick is said to have used the shamrock, a three-leaved plant, to explain the Holy Trinity to the pagan Irish.[tpl]cite web|url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0312_040312_stpatrick_2.html |title=St. Patrick's Day: Fact vs. Fiction | page = 2 |accessdate=31 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.csulb.edu/~d49er/spring00/news/v7n91-holiday.html |title=Holiday has history|accessdate=21 March 2009[/tpl] This story first appears in writing in 1726, though it may be older. In pagan Ireland, three was a significant number and the Irish had many triple deities, a fact that aided St Patrick in his evangelization efforts.Monaghan, Patricia. The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore. Infobase Publishing, 2009. p.416 The wearing of the 'St Patrick's Day Cross', especially in the World War I era, by the Irish, was also a popular custom. These St Patrick's Day Crosses have a Celtic Christian cross made of paper that is "covered with silk or ribbon of different colours, and a bunch or rosette of green silk in the centre."[tpl]cite book|last1=Cronin|first1=Mike|last2=Adair|first2=Daryl|title=The Wearing of the Green: A History of St Patrick's Day|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eAuAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA22|accessdate=28 March 2014|date=23 November 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134242313|page=22|quote=In 1681, the English traveller, Thomas Dineley noted a series of St Patrick's Day practices which in one form or another, became standard markers for those celebrating the day. Dineley observed that the Irish wore Celtic crosses, had green ribbon in their hats, pinned shamrock to their clothes, and, after demanding St Patrick's groat from their masters, drank so that 'very few of the zealous are found sober at night'. The crosses, which were predominantly made and worn by children, consisted of a paper or card backing and featuring couloured ribbons as decoration, all of which were centered around a Celtic cross. In 1805, the 'little girl's St Patrick's Day Cross' was described as a cross of paper 'wrapped or covered with silk or ribbon of different colours, and a bunch or rosette of green silk in the centre'.[/tpl]
The colour green has been associated with Ireland since at least the 1640s, when the green harp flag was used by the Irish Catholic Confederation. Green ribbons and shamrocks have been worn on St Patrick's Day since at least the 1680s.[tpl]Cite book |title=The Wearing of the Green: A History of St. Patrick's Day|authors = Mike Cronin, Daryl Adair |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-18004-7|ref=Cronin2002[/tpl] Green was adopted as the colour of the Friendly Brothers of St Patrick,The Fundamental Laws, Statutes and Constitutions of the Ancient Order of the Friendly Brothers of Saint Patrick. 1751. an Irish fraternity founded in about 1750.Kelly, James. That Damn'd Thing Called Honour: Duelling in Ireland, 1570-1860. Cork University Press, 1995. p.65 However, when the Order of St. Patrick—an Anglo-Irish chivalric order—was founded in 1783 it adopted blue as its colour. This led to blue being associated with St Patrick. In the 1790s, green became associated with Irish nationalism when it was used by the United Irishmen. This was a republican organization—led mostly by Protestants but with many Catholic members—who launched a rebellion in 1798 against British rule. The phrase "wearing of the green" comes from a song of the same name, which laments United Irishmen supporters being persecuted for wearing green. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the colour green and its association with Saint Patrick's Day grew.[tpl]Cite video |url= http://www.history.com/topics/st-patricks-day/videos#green |title=St. Patrick: Why Green? – video|publisher=History.com |accessdate=17 March 2010 [/tpl]

===Celebrations by region===

====Ireland====

Saint Patrick's feast day, as a kind of national day, was already being celebrated by the Irish in Europe in the ninth and tenth centuries. In later times, he became more and more widely known as the patron of Ireland.Liam de Paor: St. Patrick's World, The Christian Culture of Ireland's Apostolic Age. Four Courts Press, Dublin, 1993 Saint Patrick's feast day was finally placed on the universal liturgical calendar in the Catholic Church due to the influence of Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding[tpl]cite web|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: Luke Wadding|accessdate=15 February 2007|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15521d.htm[/tpl] in the early 1600s. Saint Patrick's Day thus became a holy day of obligation for Roman Catholics in Ireland. It is also a feast day in the Church of Ireland. The church calendar avoids the observance of saints' feasts during certain solemnities, moving the saint's day to a time outside those periods. Saint Patrick's Day is occasionally affected by this requirement, when 17 March falls during Holy Week. This happened in 1940, when Saint Patrick's Day was observed on 3 April in order to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and again in 2008, where it was officially observed on 14 March. Saint Patrick's Day will not fall within Holy Week again until 2160.[tpl]Cite news|title=St. Patrick's Day, Catholic Church march to different drummers|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-03-05-stpatrick_N.htm|work=USA Today | accessdate=11 March 2008 | date=6 March 2008|first=G.

[/tpl] However, the secular celebration is always held on 17 March.
In 1903, Saint Patrick's Day became an official public holiday in Ireland. This was thanks to the Bank Holiday (Ireland) Act 1903, an act of the United Kingdom Parliament introduced by Irish Member of Parliament James O'Mara.[tpl]cite web|url=http://humphrysfamilytree.com/OMara/james.html |title=James O'Mara |publisher=HumphrysFamilyTree.com |accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl] O'Mara later introduced the law that required that pubs and bars be closed on 17 March after drinking got out of hand, a provision that was repealed in the 1970s. The first Saint Patrick's Day parade held in the Irish Free State was held in Dublin in 1931 and was reviewed by the then Minister of Defence Desmond Fitzgerald.
In the mid-1990s the government of the Republic of Ireland began a campaign to use Saint Patrick's Day to showcase Ireland and its culture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historychannel.com/exhibits/stpatricksday/?page=history |title=The History of the Holiday |publisher=Historychannel.com |accessdate=17 March 2013[/tpl] The government set up a group called St Patrick's Festival, with the aims:

The first Saint Patrick's Festival was held on 17 March 1996. In 1997, it became a three-day event, and by 2000 it was a four-day event. By 2006, the festival was five days long; more than 675,000 people attended the 2009 parade. Overall 2009's five-day festival saw close to 1 million visitors, who took part in festivities that included concerts, outdoor theatre performances, and fireworks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/st-patricks-day-facts/videos#history-of-st-patricks-day |title=St. Patrick's Day Facts Video — |publisher=History.com |accessdate=17 March 2013[/tpl] Skyfest forms the centrepiece of the festival.
The topic of the 2004 Saint Patrick's Symposium was "Talking Irish", during which the nature of Irish identity, economic success, and the future were discussed. Since 1996, there has been a greater emphasis on celebrating and projecting a fluid and inclusive notion of "Irishness" rather than an identity based around traditional religious or ethnic allegiance. The week around Saint Patrick's Day usually involves Irish language speakers using more Irish during Seachtain na Gaeilge ("Irish Language Week").[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]
As well as Dublin, many other cities, towns, and villages in Ireland hold their own parades and festivals, including Cork, Belfast, Derry, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, and Waterford.
The biggest celebrations outside Dublin are in Downpatrick, County Down, where Saint Patrick is rumoured to be buried. In 2004, according to Down District Council, the week-long Saint Patrick's Festival had more than 2,000 participants and 82 floats, bands, and performers and was watched by more than 30,000 people.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
The shortest St Patrick's Day parade in the world takes place in Dripsey, Cork. The parade lasts just 100 yards and travels between the village's two pubs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dripsey.com/ |title=Dripsey |publisher=Dripsey |accessdate=6 June 2010[/tpl]
Christian leaders in Ireland have expressed concern about the secularisation of St Patrick's Day. In The Word magazine's March 2007 issue, Fr. Vincent Twomey wrote, "It is time to reclaim St Patrick's Day as a church festival." He questioned the need for "mindless alcohol-fuelled revelry" and concluded that "it is time to bring the piety and the fun together.""More piety, fewer pints 'best way to celebrate'", The Irish Independent, 12 March 2007

In March 2009, the Calgary Tower changed its top exterior lights to new green CFL bulbs just in time for Saint Patrick's Day. Part of an environmental non-profit organisation's campaign (Project Porchlight), the green represented environmental concerns. Approximately 210 lights were changed in time for Saint Patrick's Day, and resembled a Leprechaun's hat. After a week, white CFLs took their place. The change was estimated to save the Calgary Tower some $12,000 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 104 tonnes.[tpl]cite web|last=Bevan|first=Alexis|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Calgary+Tower+gets+full+green+bulb+treatment/1378992/story.html |title=Calgary Tower gets full green bulb treatment |work=Calgary Herald |date=11 March 2009 |accessdate=17 March 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090330025307/http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Calgary+Tower+gets+full+green+bulb+treatment/1378992/story.html |archivedate=30 March 2009[/tpl]

The tiny island of Montserrat is known as "Emerald Island of the Caribbean" because of its founding by Irish refugees from Saint Kitts and Nevis.  Along with Ireland and the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, St Patrick's Day is a public holiday. The holiday also commemorates a failed slave uprising that occurred on 17 March 1768.[tpl]Cite book |title= Gallery Montserrat: some prominent people in our history |last= Fergus|first= Howard A.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1996 |publisher=Canoe Press University of West Indies |location= |isbn=976-8125-25-X |page=83 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2DD81ZHWhxgC&pg=PA83&dq=Montserrat+slave+uprising&hl=en&ei=wuQUTfu6G86HhQeNxKS3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Montserrat%20slave%20uprising&f=false |accessdate=24 December 2010[/tpl]

====Russia====

The first Saint Patrick's Day parade took place in Russia in 1992.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stpatrick.ru/russian/index.htm|title=Москва. День Св. Патрика|date=1999–2007|publisher=stpatrick.ru|language=ru|accessdate=29 May 2012[/tpl] Since 1999, there is an annual international "Saint Patrick's Day" festival in Moscow and other Russian cities.[tpl]cite web|author=Erin Andersen|title=St. Patty's Day: Not just green beer — but some of that, too|url=http://journalstar.com/entertainment/misc/st-patty-s-day-not-just-green-beer-but-some/article_1a91449b-3666-5363-a249-7d5378ddd713.html|publisher=Lincoln Journal Star|date=March 17, 2013[/tpl] The Moscow parade has both official and unofficial parts. The first seems like a military parade and is performed in collaboration with the Moscow government and the Irish embassy in Moscow. The unofficial parade is performed by volunteers and seems more like a carnival and show with juggling, stilts, jolly-jumpers and Celtic music. In 2014, Moscow Irish Week was celebrated from March 12 to 23, which includes St. Patrick's Day on March 17. Over 70 events celebrating Irish culture in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Voronezh, and Volgograd were sponsored by the Irish Embassy, the Moscow City Government, and other organizations.[tpl]cite web|author=Grace Cuddihy|title=Muscovites Turn Green For Irish Week|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/arts_n_ideas/article/muscovites-turn-green-for-irish-week/496349.html|publisher=The Moscow Times|date=Mar 18, 2014[/tpl]

====Switzerland====

While Saint Patrick's Day in Switzerland is commonly celebrated on 17 March with festivities similar to those in neighbouring central European countries, it is not unusual for Swiss students to organise celebrations in their own living spaces on Saint Patrick's Eve. Most popular are usually those in Zurich's Kreis 4. Traditionally, guests also contribute with beverages and dress accordingly in green.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.amiv.ethz.ch/content/st-patricks-eve-celebrations-2012-zürich |title=Saint Patrick's Eve in Switzerland Event Page |publisher=Zurich Student Association |accessdate=20 February 2012[/tpl]
