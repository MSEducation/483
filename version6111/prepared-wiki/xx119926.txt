The Official Dreamcast Magazine was a video game magazine published by Dennis Publishing in the United Kingdom between 1999 and 2001. The magazine featured news, reviews, previews and features on Dreamcast games. The magazine held the official magazine license for the Dreamcast in the UK and featured a DreamOn demo disc on almost every cover. The magazine also featured complete games Sega Swirl and Planet Ring on its front cover. The magazine also covered fashion related to Dreamcast gaming but this feature was dropped in later issues.
The magazine was published monthly but towards the end of its life issues were sold bimonthly due to not enough content being made available for the demo discs.
