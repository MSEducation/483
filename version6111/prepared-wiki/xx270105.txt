James Postell Douglas (born Lancaster, South Carolina, January 7, 1836; died Texas, November 27, 1901) was a soldier, politician, and businessman in the state of Texas.
Douglas' parents Alexander and Margaret Douglas moved their family from South Carolina to Talladega, Alabama in 1838 and then to Texas in 1847, settling in Tyler in 1848. After his father died in 1854, Douglas supported the family by working as a school principal while reading law. In 1859 he purchased half-ownership in the Tyler Reporter newspaper (now the Tyler Courier-Times) and became its editor.Texas State Historical Society, The Handbook of Texas Online, article "James Postell Douglas" accessed 2011-09-24
After the Civil War broke out, Douglas helped raise a battery of artillery and became a first lieutenant. The only battery of Texas artillery to serve east of the Mississippi River, the First Texas Battery saw action throughout the war. Douglas was promoted to captain in July 1862. The battery was paroled in May 1865 in Mobile, Alabama and Douglas returned to Texas.
Douglas returned to being a newspaper editor. In 1870 he was elected to the Texas Senate, where he was a strong opponent of Reconstruction.
Douglas organized the Tyler Tap, basis of the later Cotton Belt Railroad, and served as its president. He was also involved with the founding of other railroads. Tyler also owned plantations, canneries, and possibly the first peach orchard in East Texas.
Douglas married twice and had a total of ten children. His second wife Alice Earle Smith survived him by many years, dying in 1955.
