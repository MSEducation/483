Dee Dee Ramone and John Carco quickly became friends after a chance meeting at an infamous Green Door party on St. Mark's Place in 1992. After several live shows and drummers in the three piece line up the two members decided to move to Amsterdam to record two albums for Rough Trade Records World Services. The Dee Dee Ramone I.C.L.C. 4 Song EP and Dee Dee Ramone I.C.L.C. I Hate Freaks Like You were both released in 1994.
