Nogometni Klub Domžale ([tpl]lang-en|Domžale Football Club[/tpl]), commonly referred to as NK Domžale or simply Domžale, is a Slovenian football club that plays in the town of Domžale. They have won both the Slovenian League and the Slovenian Supercup twice and the Slovenian Cup once.

==History==

NK Domžale was formed in 1921 and is one of the oldest Slovenian football clubs. Their current stadium (Domžale Sports Park) was built in 1948. It was renovated and modernized in 1997 and 1999. Work on the new western stand started in October 2003 and was finished in April 2004. On 29 June 2006 the stadium received reflectors, mounted on 4 concrete towers and strategically placed at each corner of the stadium. There are 120 in total, allowing matches to be played in the evening.
The club's golden age began in summer of 2002, when Slaviša Stojanovič became head coach. He brought Domžale into the 1.SNL. In the 2005–06 season, they advanced through the first two qualifying rounds of the UEFA Cup before being eliminated in the First Round by Stuttgart. They played in the 2006–07 qualifying rounds, but were eliminated by Hapoel Tel Aviv. After a 4–0 away win against Primorje on 13 May, Domžale were confirmed as league champions for the first time. This win makes the club only the fifth to claim the title since the independent league's formation in 1991–92.

==Supporters==

There are two main supporting groups for NK Domžale. The first one, the older, is a fan group formed in 1988, which goes by the name of Ravbarji. The second group, formed in late 2006, is an ultras group called the Ultras Domžale.
