[[Scarification]]

CATEGORIES: Body art, Body modification, Tattooing

Scarifying (also scarification modification) involves scratching, etching, burning / branding, or superficially cutting designs, pictures, or words into the skin as a permanent body modification.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schildkrout|first=Enid|title=Inscribing the Body|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=2004-06-11|page=320|accessdate=23 April 2014[/tpl] In the process of body scarification, scars are formed by cutting or branding the skin by varying methods (sometimes using further sequential aggravating wound healing methods at timed intervals, like irritation.), to purposely influence wound healing to scar more and not scarless. Scarification is sometimes called cicatrization (from the French equivalent).[tpl]cite web|title=Scarification and Cicatrisation Among African Cultures|url=http://www.randafricanart.com/Scarification_and_Cicatrisation_among_African_cultures.html|publisher=Rand African Art|accessdate=2012-10-17[/tpl]

==Reasons==

Within anthropology, the study of the body as a boundary has been long debated. In 1909, Van Gennep described bodily transformations, including tattooing, scarification, and painting, as rites of passage.[tpl]cite book|last=Van Gennep|first=A|title=Les Rites De Passage|date=1909|publisher=E. Nourry|location=Paris[/tpl] In 1963, Levi-Strauss described the body as a surface waiting for the imprintation of culture.[tpl]cite book|last=Levi-Strauss|first=C|title=Structural Anthropology|date=1963|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York[/tpl] Turner(1980) first used the term "social skin" in his detailed discussion of how Kayapo culture was constructed and expressed through individual bodies.[tpl]cite book|last=Turner|first=TS|title=Not Work Alone: A Cross-Cultural View of Activities Superfluous to Survival|date=1980|publisher=Sage|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=112–140[/tpl] Inscribed skin highlights an issue that has been central to anthropology since its inception: the question of boundaries between the individual and society, between societies, and between representation and experiences.
There are currently 4 competing hypotheses behind the behavior ecology of scarification: (1) a rite of passage, (2) a hardening/trauma procedure, (3) a nonadaptive sexually selected character, or (4) an adaptive pathogen-driven sexually selected character.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ludvico|coauthors=Kurland|title=Symbolic or Not-so-Symbolic Wounds: The Behavioral Ecology of Human Scarification|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|date=1995|volume=16|issue=2|pages=155–172|accessdate=23 April 2014[/tpl] There are also aesthetic, religious, and social reasons for scarification. For example, scarification has been widely used by many West African tribes to mark milestone stages in both men and women's lives, such as puberty and marriage. It is also used to transmit complex messages about identity; such permanent body markings may emphasize fixed social, political, and religious roles. Tattoos, scars, brands, and piercings, when voluntarily acquired, are ways of showing a person's autobiography on the surface of the body to the world.
Tribe members unwilling to participate in scarification were generally not included in the group’s activities. According to anthropologist Grace Harris, group members lacking the normal characteristics consistent of the group are not considered as acquiring the full standings as agents in their society, they would also lack the capacity for meaningful behavior, such as greeting, commanding, and stating.[tpl]cite journal|last=Harris|first=Grace Gredys|title=Concepts of Individual, Self, and Person in Description Analysis|journal=American Anthropologist|date=1989|volume=91|issue=3|pages=599-612[/tpl] Therefore scarification can transform partial tribe members into normal states entirely accepted by the group. Scarification a form of language not readily expressed, except through extensive and intricate greetings, gives the ability to communicate fully which is a key element for being considered as a normal member of the group.[tpl]cite journal|last=Harris|first=Grace Gredys|title=Concepts of Individual, Self, and Person in Description Analysis|journal=American Anthropologist|date=1989|volume=91|issue=3|pages=599-612[/tpl]
Research has also been conducted to show a connection in the different anatomical locations between the sexes as linked to pathogen prevalence in their area. Scarification in these areas is thought to be done to clearly show which individuals are pathogen-resistant mates. It is thought that as pathogen severity increase, so should permanent marking of body areas that are attended to for evaluating attractiveness and mate quality. Females were predicted to scarify their breasts and stomachs (due to the stomach being a component of waist-to-hip ratio), both indicative of youthfulness and fertility. Males were predicted to scarify those body parts indicative of sexual maturity and strength, such as the face, shoulders, and arms. The findings of this research revealed that pathogen prevalence predicts female stomach scarification independent of polygyny, famine, and social class stratification. The relationship between scarification of body parts and pathogen prevalence was not evident for males. These findings, based upon between-society comparisons, suggest that stomach scarification could act as a signal of female mate quality in societies that encounter a high prevalence of pathogens.[tpl]cite journal|last=Singh|first=Devendra|coauthors=Bronstad|title=Sex Differences in the Anatomical Locations of Human Body Scarification and Tattooing as a Function of Pathogen Prevalence|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=1997-02-28|volume=8|issue=6|pages=403–416|accessdate=23 April 2014[/tpl]

==Methods==

Scarification is not a precise practice; variables, such as skin type, cut depth, and how the wound is treated while healing, make the outcome unpredictable. A method that works on one person may not work on another. The scars tend to spread as they heal, so outcome design is usually simple, the details being lost during healing.

===Branding===

Human branding is one type of scarification. It is similar in nature to livestock branding.

===Cutting===

Cutting of the skin for cosmetic purposes is not to be confused with self-harm, which is also referred to by the euphemism "cutting." There may be cases of self-mutilation and self-scarification for non-cosmetic reasons. Lines are cut with surgical blades.  Techniques include:

===Abrasion===

Scars can be formed by removing layers of skin through abrasion. This can be achieved using an inkless tattooing device, or any object that can remove skin through friction (such as sandpaper).
Chemical scarification uses corrosive chemicals to remove skin and induce scarring. The effects of this method are typically  similar to other, simpler forms of scarification; as a result there has been little research undertaken on this method.

==Healing==

The common practice on healing a scarification wound is use of irritation.
An alternative view is described by the acronym LITHA, meaning Leave It The Hell Alone. In body modification this is often considered the best way to reduce the risk of infection and the pain of healing.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl]

==Dangers/cautions==

Scarification produces harm and trauma to the skin; thus it is considered to be unsafe by many. Infection is a concern. Not only does this hurt, the materials for inducing the wounds need to be sanitary, but the wound needs to be kept clean, using antibacterial solutions or soaps often, and having good hygiene in general. It is not uncommon, especially if the wound is being irritated, for a local infection to develop around the wound. The scarification worker needs to have detailed knowledge of the anatomy of human skin, in order to prevent tools cutting too deep, burning too hot, or burning for too long. Scarification is not nearly as popular as tattooing, so it is harder  to find workers experienced in scarification. Precautions are made for brandings, such as wearing masks, because it is possible for diseases to be passed from the skin into the air when the skin is burning, that can lead to death from the tool they use.
