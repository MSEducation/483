Neepsend railway station was a railway station on the former Great Central Railway in England. Ski Village railway station is a proposed station to occupy the former Neepsend station site.

==History==

Neepsend railway station was opened on 1 July 1888 to serve the industrial suburb of Neepsend, to the north west of Sheffield city centre. It was situated on the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway's (latterly the Great Central Railway) Woodhead Line which connected Sheffield Victoria and Manchester London Road.
The station consisted of two flanking platforms joined by a footbridge which also served to carry a footpath over the railway. The platforms were both served by small buildings in the pre-double pavilion style used by the M.S.& L.R. It was unusually located, the Sheffield-bound (up) platform being built against the face of a cutting whilst the opposite platform (down) saw a long drop to street level. A signal box, narrow based but opening out above the stock loading gauge, was located at the Manchester end of the 'down' platform.

==Present==

Due to low public usage of the station, caused by the better sited Corporation tramway services, it was closed to passengers on 28 October 1940 although the buildings and the signal box remained in situ until the 1970s. All traces of the original station have now been removed, with even the footbridge recently replaced with a new structure.The Woodhead Site - Neepsend station
