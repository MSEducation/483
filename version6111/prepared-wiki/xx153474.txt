Teurlings Catholic High School is a private, Roman Catholic high school in Lafayette, Louisiana.  It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette.

==Background==

Teurlings Catholic High School was established in 1955 as Father Teurlings High School.  Father William J. Teurlings was the pastor who envisioned the school and arranged for the purchase of the property the school sits on.  The school opened shortly before his death in 1957.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tchs.net/information.htm|title=School History|accessdate=2007-05-11|author=TCHS |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070214102659/http://www.tchs.net/information.htm  |archivedate = 2007-02-14[/tpl]

==Facilities==

The school is an open campus, consisting of 38 classrooms divided among different wings, a gymnasium (known as the "Rebeldome"), a cafeteria, library, practice football field, softball and baseball fields, weight room and athletic office, science lab, teacher's lounge, and other standard high school facilities.  One unique facility that the school holds is "The Deck," a wooden deck used as a commons area for students before school, during break, and during lunch.  There are three unpaved parking lots reserved for students:  The side lot which runs along the gymnasium, the back lot which is located near the baseball and softball fields, and the front lot which is located in the front of school.  There is a paved parking lot in front of the gym reserved for faculty and visitors.

==Clubs and organizations==

Teurlings has a number of extracurricular activities available to students, perhaps most notably their nationally ranked Speech and Debate team. The team has numerous team state championships, individual state champions in events such as Extemporaneous Speaking and Student Congress, and elimination-round competitors at national tournaments such as the National Forensic League national tournament and the National Catholic Forensic League Grand National Tournament (as well as national invitational tournaments at Harvard University and George Mason University). The school also offers a variety of other extracurricular activities, such as 4-H, SADD (Students Against Destructive Decisions), Key Club, French Club, Art Club, FCA (Fellowship of Christian Athletes), Rebel Ambassadors, Student Council, Quiz Bowl, Beta Club, National Honors Society, and Retreat Ministry. Most clubs contribute large amounts of community service hours, and hold many fundraisers throughout the year.

Teurlings Catholic offers the following athletic teams (all co-ed unless otherwise specified):  Baseball (boys), Basketball, Bowling, Cross Country, Football, Golf, Soccer, Softball, Tennis, Swimming, Track and Field (both indoor and outdoor), Volleyball (girls), Wrestling, Drumline, Rebel Revue Dance Team,and Cheerleading.  As of the 2007-2008 school year, the school competes in Division AAAA (formerly competing in AAA).  All teams hold numerous district titles, most have won at least one state championship, and both the Rebel Revue and Cheerleaders have placed in the Top 3 in the nation in many contests.  The school holds many small rivalries, such as the "Moss Street Rivalry" with Northside High School.  Other rivals include Notre Dame High School (Crowley), Breaux Bridge High School (Breaux Bridge), and St. Thomas More High School (Lafayette).  The most advertised rivalry, however, is with Catholic High School of New Iberia.  All indoor sports (with the exception of indoor track and swimming) are played in the school's gym, named the "Rebeldome."  Football games are played at Clark Field, a public stadium at the old N.P. Moss Middle School's campus on the north side of the city (though a capital campaign to build their own stadium is currently in the works).  Soccer games are played at various fields such as Moore Park in Carencro.  Tennis plays at nearby Acadiana Park.  Softball and Baseball games are played on the school's on-site baseball/softball fields.  Bowling, Golf, and Track and Field/Cross Country utilize an array of facilities around Lafayette.

==Demographics==

Most students come from middle/upper-middle-class families; however, a percentage of the students attend the school on work-study grants.  Most students reside in Upper Lafayette, or in St. Martin and St. Landry Parishes.

==Feeder Schools==

Most students feed from the following schools (located in Lafayette unless otherwise noted):
Though they are not recognized as feeder schools, some students come from schools such as Our Lady of Fatima, St. Pius X, St. Cecilia School (Broussard), Cathedral Carmel School, and various public schools around Lafayette Parish.

==School hours/schedule==

The school holds classes Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. until 2:30 p.m.  Student schedules consist of seven periods; however, due to their unique rolling block schedule, students attend five 70-minute periods a day, with five minutes of transition time between classes, a ten-minute break after the second period, and a thirty-five minute lunch period.  On Thursdays, the school holds a mass in the Rebeldome, and the bell schedule is adjusted accordingly.  Other schedules are implemented for special occasions, such as early dismissals, afternoon activities, or days when students are required to report to homeroom to conduct school business.  One day that is unlike any other area school is Holy Thursday, when students report to school at 6:30 a.m. and attend a Passion Play put on by the members of the Senior Class.
