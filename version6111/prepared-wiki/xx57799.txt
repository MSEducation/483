[[Kensington Gore]]

CATEGORIES: Streets in Kensington and Chelsea

Kensington Gore is the name of two almost parallel thoroughfares on the south side of Hyde Park in central London, England. The streets connect the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal College of Art, the Royal Geographical Society and in Kensington Gardens the Albert Memorial. The area is named after the Gore estate which occupied the site until it was developed by Victorian planners in the mid 19th century.  A gore is a narrow, triangular piece of land.

==History==

Gore House was once the residence of political reformer, William Wilberforce between 1808 and 1821. The three-acre (12,000 mÂ²) estate was then occupied by the Countess of Blessington and the Count D'Orsay from 1836 to 1849. 
In May 1851, the house was opened as a restaurant by the chef Alexis Soyer, who planned to cater for the 1851 Great Exhibition in Hyde Park. After the exhibition and following the advice of Prince Albert, Gore House and its grounds were bought by the Exhibition's Royal Commission to create the cultural quarter known as Albertopolis.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/ExploringSouthKensington/SouthKensingtonFromAbove/1856-1862.aspx | work= Albertopolis | title= South Kensington From Above: 1856 - 1862 | publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects|accessdate=17 December 2010[/tpl]
In 1871, the Royal Albert Hall was completed on the site of the former house. It was officially opened by Queen Victoria.
In 1892, The Gore Hotel was opened by two sisters, Miss Ada and Ms Cooke, both descendants of Captain James Cook. The 50 bedroom luxury hotel has been featured in many music videos and photo shoots, such as for Beggars Banquet by The Rolling Stones.The Gore Hotel website
