The 1893–94 season was the second in the history of the Western Football League, which was known as the Bristol & District League until 1895. After a single division the previous season, a second division was formed, mostly of reserve teams from Division One clubs.
Warmley were the Division One champions again, having won the league in its initial season the previous year. Their reserve team won the new Division Two.Robinson, Michael (ed.), Non-League Football Tables 1889–2006, Soccer Books, 2006
