==History==

The Disco Biscuits formed at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1995.  Their name is a slang term for Quaaludes.

==Diamond Riggs Studios==

After purchasing the former Old City Philadelphia studio space of DJ Jazzy Jeff in 2006, the band found themselves with an abundance of resources, and came to find out that there are a lot of local musicians that needed a place to congregate and work. In part, this helped launch the unique collaborations that made up the Planet Anthem sessions.

==Camp Bisco==

Camp Bisco is an electronic and jam band music festival, hosted and centered around The Disco Biscuits at Indian Lookout Country Club in upstate New York.  The Disco Biscuits launched Camp Bisco in 1999 with the idea of combining sets by electronic DJs with improvisational rock bands at a time when both the jam band and electronic dance music scenes were taking off in their own rights. The two scenes overlapped at a certain juncture via bands like Sound Tribe Sector Nine (STS9) and the Disco Biscuits. Camp Bisco has since expanded to include indie rockers and hip-hop artists.  Acts such as Skrillex, Bassnectar, Amon Tobin and Big Gigantic performed at the 11th annual festival in July 2012.
The Disco Biscuits (tDB) are involved in a number of charities. At Camp Bisco they host a food drive with Strangers Helping Strangers each year to help the Duanesburg-Florida Baptist Church Food Pantry located right near the venue at Indian Lookout Country Club. Additionally, tDB support the efforts of HeadCount, of which Marc Brownstein is a Director.
The Disco Biscuits also raised charitable donations, through Camp Bisco, by offering tickets to people who made 'generous donations'. The donations supported  Hurricane Irene relief for upstate New York's Schenectady County where Camp Bisco is located.
