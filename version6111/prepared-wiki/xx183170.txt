Archbishop Placide Louise Chapelle (August 28, 1842, Fraissinet-de-Lozère, Lozère, France – August 9, 1905, New Orleans, United States) was a French-American Roman Catholic archbishop.
Chapelle was ordained in June 1865, appointed to the Archdiocese of Santa Fe from 1894, and appointed by Leo XIII to the Archdiocese of New Orleans concurrently from December 1897.  The following year he became apostolic delegate in Cuba and Puerto Rico and the extraordinary envoy in the Philippines.Gerardo Alberto Hernández-Aponte, La Iglesia Católica en Puerto Rico ante la invasión de Estados Unidos de América.

Chapelle's mission in the Philippines was particularly difficult due to the Spanish-American War. His knowledge of English, Spanish and French, and his excellent knowledge of the American constitution, allowed him to render great service to the Holy See.  He perished of yellow fever.
