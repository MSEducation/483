The common minke whale or northern minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is a species of minke whale within the suborder of baleen whales. It is the smallest member of the rorquals and the second smallest species of baleen whale. Although first ignored by whalers due to its small size and low oil yield, it began to be exploited by various countries beginning in the early 20th century. As other species declined larger numbers of common minke whales were caught, largely for their meat. It is now one of the primary targets of the whaling industry. There is a dwarf form in the Southern Hemisphere.

==Vernacular names==

The origins of the species' common name are obscure. One of the first references to the name came in Henrik Johan Bull's account of his 1893-95 voyage to the Antarctic, when he mentioned catching a small whale "called in the Arctic language a Mencke whale, after a German who accompanied Mr. Foyn on some of his voyages."Bull, H. J. (1896). The cruise of the 'Antarctic' to the South Polar regions. London: Edward Arnold. According to the British writer John Guille Millais (The mammals of Great Britain and Ireland, 1906, vol. 3, p. 279), "Minkie was a Norwegian seaman who was always calling 'Hval' at whatever backfin he saw. He is now regarded as the type of the 'tenderfoot' at sea. Norwegians often refer to any small whale with some contempt or amusement as a 'Minkie' or 'Minkie's hval'."Allen, G. M. (1916). The whalebone whales of New England. Boston.  The American marine biologist and painter Richard Ellis, citing the Norwegian scientist Age Jonsgård, stated "that Meincke was a German laborer working for Svend Foyn, inventor of the grenade harpoon. Meincke 'one day mistook a school of this whale species for blue whales.... most probably he made this mistake during Foyn's whaling operations in the Varanger Fjord between 1868 and 1885."Ellis, Richard. 1980. The Book of Whales. Alfred Knopf, New York.
It has formerly been known as the little piked whale, the lesser or least rorqual, and the sharp-headed finner. American whalemen in the 19th century simply thought of them as "young finbacks" or a "Finback's calf", apparently under the impression that they were juveniles of their larger relative, the fin whale.[tpl]cite book |last=Scammon |first=Charles |title=The Marine Mammals of the North-western Coast of North America: Together with an Account of the American Whale-fishery |year=1874; 1968 |publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0-486-21976-9 [/tpl] They were also called zwergwal (German: "dwarf whale") or vågehval (Norwegian: "bay whale").

==Taxonomy==

Otto Fabricius, in his Fauna Groenlandica (1780), was the first to describe the minke, noting its small size and white baleen. He unfortunately described it under the name Balaena rostrata, which was already preoccupied by a beaked whale. In 1804, Baron de Lacepede named it Balaenoptera acuto-rostrata, basing his description partly on the stranding of a 4.26 m (14 ft) juvenile female near Cherbourg, France in 1791.True, F. W. (1904). The whalebone whales of the western North Atlantic: Compared with those occurring in European waters. Washington: Smithsonian institution. 
In 1872, the American whaleman and naturalist Charles Melville Scammon described and named Balaenoptera davidsoni, after an 8.3 m (27 ft) pregnant female that was found dead on the north shore of Admiralty Inlet in October 1870 in then Washington Territory (now Washington State) and towed into Port Townsend Bay by Italian fisherman, who flensed it on the beach. Scammon mentioned its "dwarfish size", "pointed head", "falcated dorsal fin", and the "white band" on its "inordinately small, pointed pectorals". In 1877, the Italian geologist and paleontologist Giovanni Capellini described and named Sibbaldius mondini from a juvenile specimen that was captured off Italy in 1771. Both were later synonymized with B. acutorostrata.Van Waerebeek, K., Andre, M., Sequeira, M., Martin, V., Robineau, D., Collet, A., Papastavrou, V. and Ndiyaye, E. (1999). "Spatial and temporal distribution of the minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata (Lacepede, 1804), in the southern northeast Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, with reference to stock identity". Journal of Cetacean Research and Management 1 (3): 223-238. 
A smaller, Southern Hemisphere form of minke whale with white-banded flippers was first described in separate studies by Peter Best (1985) and Peter Arnold, Helene Marsh, and George Heinsohn (1987), though a white-flippered form in the Southern Hemisphere had been noted earlier. The former described a "diminutive form" based on specimens caught off Durban, South Africa, while the latter named a "dwarf form" based on specimens and sightings from Australia. This unnamed subspecies has a prominent white flipper and shoulder blaze and a dark throat patch, whereas what was called the "dark-shouldered" or "ordinary" form of minke whale (now known as a separate species, the Antarctic minke whale, B. bonaerensis) lacked these contrasting markings.Best, P. 1985. "External characters of southern minke whales and the existence of a diminutive form". Scientific Reports of the Whales Research Institute 36: 1-33.Arnold, P., Marsh, H. and Heinsohn, G. 1987. "The occurrence of two forms of minke whales in east Australian waters with a description of external characters and skeleton of the diminutive or dwarf form". Scientific Reports of the Whales Research Institute 38: 1-46.
Until recently, all minke whales were considered a single species.  However, the common minke whale was recognized as a separate species from the Antarctic minke whale based on mitochondrial DNA testing.[tpl]cite web|title=Cetacean mitochondrial DNA control region: sequences of all extant baleen whales and two sperm whale species|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/5/960|accessdate=2007-07-13[/tpl]  This testing also confirmed that the Antarctic minke whale is the closest relative of the common minke whale, thus confirming the validity of the minke whale clade.

==Description==

===Size===

The common minke whale is the smallest of the rorquals, and one of the smallest baleen whales (second smallest only to the Pygmy right whale). In the North Atlantic, Norwegian whaling vessels in 1940 allegedly caught individuals of up to 10.7 m (35 ft) in length, but they were likely only measured visually in comparison to objects of known dimensions aboard the ships themselves – the longest caught in subsequent years were typically only up to 9.4-10.05 m (31–33 ft) in length.Øien, N. (1988). "Length distribution in catches from the northeastern Atlantic stock of minke whales". Report of the International Whaling Commission 39: 289-296. In the North Pacific, Soviet vessels operating out of the Kuril Islands claimed to have caught two males of 12.2 (40 ft) and 12 m (39.4 ft) and a female of 10.7 m (35.1 ft) – the first two were landed in 1951, the third in 1960.Ivashin, M. (1992). "USSR catch and sightings data". Report of the Scientific Committee on North Pacific minke whales (Appendix 7), p. 168. These likely represent undersized sei whales, part of the massive misreporting of whaling data by the Soviet Union in the North Pacific and elsewhere.
The longest measured by Icelandic scientists were an 8.7 m (28.5 ft) male and a 9 m (29.5 ft) female, while the longest caught by the Japanese in the western North Pacific were 8.5 m (27.9 ft) males and a 9.1 m (29.8 ft) female – the latter caught off eastern Hokkaido in 1977.Hauksson, E., G. A. Víkingsson, S. D. Halldorsson, D. Olafsdottir, and J. Sigurjónsson. (2011). "Preliminary report on biological parameters for NA minke whales in Icelandic waters".

Report of the International Whaling Commission 43: 443-456. For the dwarf form, the longest reported lengths are 7.62 m (25 ft) for males and 7.77 (25.5 ft) for females.
Males caught in the western North Pacific and weighed whole on a truck scale averaged between 2.85 and 4.23 metric tons (range: 0.86 to 6.36 metric tons), while females averaged between 1.93 and 3.63 metric tons (range: 0.84 to 8.35 metric tons).Kishiro, T., Kato, H., Ohizumi, H., Yoshida, H., Saito, T., Isoda, T., and Kawahara, S.

At sexual maturity, males and females in the North Atlantic average between 6.16-6.75 m (20.2-22.1 ft) and 6.03-7.15 m (19.8-23.4 ft), while in the North Pacific they average between 6.3-6.8 m (20.7-22.3 ft) and 7.1-7.3 m (23.3-23.9 ft). At physical maturity, males and females in the North Atlantic average between 7.9-8.17 m (25.9-26.8 ft) and 8.42-8.5 m (27.6-27.9 ft), while in the North Pacific they are slightly smaller, averaging only 7.5 and 8 m (24.6 and 26.2 ft), respectively. At birth, they are estimated to be 2.5-2.8 m (8.5-9.2 ft) in length and weigh 150–300 kg (330-660 lbs). They are thought to be weaned at about 4.57 m (15 ft) in length.Christensen, I. (1981). "Age determination of minke whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, from laminated structures in the tympanic bulla". Report of the International Whaling Commission 31: 245-253. For the dwarf form, they are thought to reach sexual maturity at around 6.2 m (20.3 ft) for females and 6 m (19.7 ft) for males and are estimated to be about 2 m (6.5 ft) at birth.Zerbini, A. N., Secchi, E. R., Siciliano, S. and Simoes-Lopes, P. C. 1996. "The dwarf form of the minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata Lacepede, 1804, in Brazil". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 46: 333-340.

===Appearance===

====Northern form====

Common minke whales are among the most robust members of their genus, the greatest height of their body to total length being one to five. They have a narrow, pointed, triangular rostrum, and a prominent, falcate dorsal fin, which averages about 30 cm (12 in) in height (range: 7–77 cm in), set two-thirds the way along the back. They are dark gray dorsally and clean white ventrally, with two broad light gray swaths (the thorax and flank patches, which join ventrally) on the flank and a light-colored shoulder streak or chevron oriented towards the anterior. Most have a prominent, transverse, white flipper band – though it can be obscure in a small percentage of individuals in the western North Pacific. The majority of common minke whales have creamy white baleen plates, with a small percentage in the western North Pacific (mostly larger individuals) having baleen plates with a thin black band along the outer margin. They possess 50 to 70 thin ventral pleats, which only extend about 47 percent of the body length – among the shortest relative to body length among the rorquals, second only to the sei whale.Kato, H., T. Kishiro, T. Fujise, and S. Wada. (1992). "Morphology of minke whales in the Okhotsk Sea, Sea of Japan and off the East Coast of Japan, with respect to stock identification".

"Minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) from the west coast of North America: individual recognition and small-scale site fidelity". Reports of the International Whaling Commission (Special Issue 12): 357-368.
The common minke whale differs from the Antarctic variety in several aspects.  The common species is slightly smaller than the Antarctic, which has much less white marking on the flippers.  There are also less distinctive differences in body coloration and shape.[tpl]cite book|title=Whales Dolphins and other Marine Mammals of the World|author=Jarrett, Brett and Shirihai, Hadoram|year=2006|pages=62–68|isbn=0-691-12757-3[/tpl]

====Dwarf form====

The dwarf minke whale has similar proportions to the northern form, with an upright, hooked dorsal fin set about two-thirds the way along the back that is up to 32 to 34 cm (12.6 to 13.4 in.) in height. It has 55 to 67 ventral grooves. Its baleen – 18 to 20 cm (7 to 7.9 in.) in length – is mostly white, with up to 30 per cent of the posterior plates shading from black to dusky gray along their outer margins.Acevedo, J., Aguayo-Lobo, A., Acuna, P., and Pastene, L. A. (2006). "A note on the first record of the dwarf minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in Chilean waters". Journal of Cetacean Research and Management 8 (3): 293-296.Dawson, S. M. and Slooten, E. (1990). "Stranding of a dwarf minke whale at Banks Peninsula, New Zealand". New Zealand Natural Science 17: 89-93.
The dwarf form has the most complex coloration of any baleen whale. Dark gray fields and capes alternate with light gray and white blazes, patches, and streaks. The dark gray spinal field lies above an ivory white ventral field. This spinal field extends down into a nape field, which separates a light gray rostral saddle and a light gray, triangular, usually forwardly peaked thorax patch. The nape field, in turn, extends even further down into a dark throat patch, which reaches down to the ventral pleats and extends back to the front of the pectoral fins. Further back the spinal field extends into a dark thorax field, which usually forms an inverted triangle between the thorax patch and the light gray flank patch. This flank patch can be separated into an anterior and posterior flank patch by a dark triangular or even wave-like flipper infill. Finally, the dark peduncle field covers the posterior portion of the caudal peduncle to the tips of the dorsal side of the flukes, which are white ventrally and thinly bordered by dark gray.Arnold, P. W., Birtles, R. A., Dunstan, A., Lukoschek, V., and Matthews, M. (2005). "Colour patterns of the dwarf minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata sensu lato: description, cladistic analysis and taxonomic implications". Memoirs of the Queensland Museum 51: 277-307.
The most prominent features on the dwarf minke whale are the white flipper and shoulder blazes. The former covers the proximal two-thirds of the pectoral fin and continues along its leading edge, while the latter connects to the thorax patch above. A variably sized, dark oval auxiliary patch (formerly called a "flipper oval") lies behind the pectoral fin, often appearing to merge with the dark gray distal flipper patch, which occupies the distal third of the pectoral fin. This auxiliary patch is often completely separated from the thorax patch by the white of the shoulder blaze and a vertical extension of the ventral field, but can also narrowly or even broadly attach to it. A mandible blaze usually covers the posterior third of the right lower jaw, while the left side is normally dark gray. Similarly, a white eye blaze is usually present on the right side, but rarely on the left. The rostral saddle likewise shows asymmetrical coloration, extending further on the right side than on the left and having a more well defined posterior right margin; the left, meanwhile, often has a diffuse posterior margin. A white peduncle blaze extends up from the ventral field, being bordered on each side by light gray double caudal chevrons, which extend down from the peduncle field and flank patch, respectively. 
A variably shaped, thin, light gray line, called the nape streak (analogous to the "shoulder streak" or "chevron" of the northern form), extends laterally down the back between the pectoral fins. It can point forward, backwards or form a straight line; this variability can help to identify individual whales. A pair of light gray blowhole streaks extend posteriorly behind the blowholes, often curving to the left – the left more strongly than the right. Occasionally fine ear stripes may be present behind the opening of the auditory meatus, while dark or light speckling or streaking can occur along the flanks as well as what are called tiger stripes – "parallel, dark, usually vertical stripes". 
Like Bryde's whale (and occasionally blue and fin whales), dwarf minkes can exhibit auxiliary ridges on either side of the central ridge of the rostrum.

==Distribution==

===Range===

Common minke whales have a disjointed distribution. In the North Atlantic, they occur as far north as Baffin Bay, Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, and Novaya Zemlya and as far south as 40° N (New Jersey) and the Hebrides and central North Sea during summer. They occur year-round off the Canary Islands. There are occasional sightings and strandings off Spain and Portugal, western Sahara, Mauritania, and Senegal. It is rare off the Azores and a vagrant in the Mediterranean Sea, with a single record in the Black Sea. During the winter it has been recorded off Bermuda, the Bahamas, the Antilles, the east coast of the United States south of 40° N, and in the southeastern North Atlantic between 10°40' N and 19°35' N and 22°W and 20°05' W.Mitchell, E. D. 1991. "Winter records of the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata Lacepede 1804) in the southern North Atlantic". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 41: 455-457.Folkow, L. P. and Blix, A. S. (1991). "Norwegian whale sightings and acoustic surveys in the Atlantic Ocean during the winter of 1989/90". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 41: 531-538. In the western North Pacific, they range from the East China Sea, Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan in the south to the Sea of Okhotsk and Bering and Chukchi Seas in the north.Ivashin, M. V. and Votrogov, L. M. 1981. "Minke whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata davidsoni, inhabiting inshore waters of the Chukotka coast". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 31: 231. In the eastern North Pacific, they occur in the Gulf of Alaska south along the entire west coast of North America down to Baja California and into the Gulf of California. During winter, they've been acoustically recorded mainly between 15° and 35° N in the eastern and central North Pacific.Rankin, S. and Barlow, J. 2005. "Source of the North Pacific "boing" sound attributed to minke whales". Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 118: 3346-3351. 
The dwarf form has been recorded off Brazil (including the states of Maranhão, Paraíba, Bahía, Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sol) from 2° 44’ S to 33° 35’ S,Magalhaes, F.

===Population===

====North Atlantic====

There are estimated to be over 180,000 common minke whales in the North Atlantic. Sighting surveys conducted in the Northeastern Atlantic between 1996 and 2001 resulted in an estimated abundance of 107,205 whales, with 43,835 in the Barents Sea region, 26,718 around Jan Mayen, 18,174 in the Greenland Sea and around the Svalbard archipelago, and 17,895 in the northern North Sea.Skaug, H. J., Øien, N., Schweder, T., and Bøthun, G. (2004). "Abundance of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the Northeast Atlantic: variability in time and space". Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 61 (6): 870-886. There are an estimated 67,225 whales off Iceland. Based on an aerial survey performed in waters between northern Disko Island (70°45’ N) and Cape Farewell (60° N) during August and September 2005, there are estimated to be 4,856 individuals (95% confidence interval (CV): 1,910-12,348) off Western Greenland; a ship-based survey made during September and October of the same year came up with a similar estimate of 4,479 (95% CI: 1,760-11,394).Heide-Jørgensen, M. P., Simon, M. J., and Laidre, K. L. (2007). "Estimates of large whale abundance in Greenlandic waters from a ship-based survey in 2005". J. Cetacean Res. Manage. 9 (2): 95-104.Heide-Jørgensen, M.

J. Cetacean Res. Manage. 10 (2): 119-129. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, line-transect aerial surveys done in August-September 1995 and July-August 1996 estimated there were 1,020 minke whales there, with about 75% of them on the North Shore shelf.Kingsley, M. C. S., and Reeves, R. R. (1998). "Aerial surveys of cetaceans in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1995 and 1996". Canadian Journal of Zoology 76 (8): 1529-1550.

====North Pacific====

Ship-based sighting surveys that covered the Okhotsk Sea during August 1989 and August-September 1990 and adjacent areas of the Northwest Pacific during July and August 1990 estimated there were 25,049 (95% CI: 13,700-45,800) minke whales there, with 19,209 (95% CI: 10,100-36,600) in the Okhotsk Sea and 5,841 (95% CI: 2,800-12,000) in the Northwest Pacific.Buckland, S. T., Cattanach, K. L. and Miyashita, T. (1992). "Minke whale abundance in the northwest Pacific and Okhotsk Sea, estimated from 1989 and 1990 sighting surveys". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 42: 387-392. Sighting surveys conducted in the central Bering Sea between July and August 1999 estimated there were 936 (95% CI: 473-1,852) individuals in those waters, while a line-transect sighting survey that cruised from the central Aleutian Islands east to the Kenai Peninsula from July-August 2001-2003 estimated there were 1,232 (95% CI: 646-2,346) whales in that area, with the majority of the sightings around the eastern Aleutian Islands, particularly in and around Seguam Pass and the Islands of Four Mountains; a few sightings were also made along the Alaska Peninsula and near Kodiak Island.Moore, S. E., Waite, J. M., Mazzuca, L. L., and Hobbs, R. C. (2000). "Mysticete whale abundance and observations on prey association on the central Bering Sea shelf". J. Cetacean Res.

Deep-Sea Research 53: 1772-1790. In the coastal waters of British Columbia, there are estimated to be 475 (95% CI: 221-1,020) whales based on sightings from ship-based line-transect surveys made during the summers of 2004 and 2005.Williams, R., and Thomas, L. (2007). "Distribution and abundance of marine mammals in the coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada". J. Cetacean Res. Manage. 9 (1): 15-28. 

====Southern Hemisphere====

There are no population estimates for dwarf minke whales due to sighting surveys not being able to distinguish it from the much more common Antarctic minke whale.

===Occurrence===

====Site fidelity====

Minke whales individually identified in three separate study sites on the western coast of North America showed strong site fidelity. A total of 55 individuals were identified, 30 in the San Juan Islands of Washington State from 1980 to 1984, 17 in the Monterey Bay area of central California from 1984 to 1987, and eight in the Johnstone Strait area of British Columbia from 1981 to 1987 – although in the last region most were only photographed incidentally to the study of killer whales. The number of sightings per individual ranged from only one in one year to 37 over nine years, with 31 whales (56.4%) being sighted in at least two years and 12 (21.8%) being seen in at least five years. Most were seen exclusively or almost exclusively in one of three sub-regions in the San Juan Islands and one of two sub-regions in the Monterey Bay area.
In the San Juan Islands, 14 out of 18 whales were within their primary range on at least 94 per cent of sightings. Of the three sub-regions, Range A, northwest of Orcas Island, had the most stable constituency, with five individuals seen repeatedly over the study period, accounting for all but one of 88 sightings. Range B, east of San Juan Island, had the least stable constituency as well as the lowest number of sightings per year, while Range C, south and west of San Juan Island, had the greatest number of sightings and the greatest number of identified individuals every year. One whale, S4, was repeatedly and consistently found in Range B for three years, but was never seen there again after 1982; few sightings were made since then and all of these occurred in 1984, most of them involving three whales that were usually found in Range A (S8, S10, and S13). In Range C, five whales were seen there every year, while seven were only seen in a single year – most of the latter individuals were never encountered in any other part of the study site. There were also whales that showed no site fidelity at all, moving freely between the sub-regions. For example, whale S9, although only being sighted five times over four years, had sightings evenly divided between ranges B and C; whale S5, on the other hand, encountered 27 times over the course of eight years, was seen in more than one range in most years and moved around the three sub-regions more than any other whale.
In the Monterey Bay area, Range A was north of the deep-water canyon that runs into Carmel Bay, while Range B was south of that canyon. Individuals were sighted within one of the two ranges on at least 88 per cent of the sightings, with whales even being observed to turn around as they approached the border of their primary range and head back toward the middle of their range – this happened five times at the northern border and twice at the southern border of Range A, and six times at the northern border of Range B. Whales were sighted within 3 km (1.8 miles) of the coast, occasionally just outside the kelp, most of the time moving in a more or less straight line.
In a photo-identification study of minke whales off Iceland conducted between 2001 and 2010, a total of 353 whales were individually identified: 292 in Faxaflói Bay, on the southwest coast, and 61 in Skjálfandi Bay, on the northeast coast. In Faxaflói Bay, 68 (23.3%) were resighted at least once, with 53 (18.2%) being resighted in two years, nine (3.1%) in three years, and six (2.1%) in four years. The majority in Skjálfandi was only sighted in one year, while ten (16.4%) were resighted at least once, four (6.6%) in two years, and six (9.8%) in three years or more. One whale, first photographed in Skjálfandi Bay in July 2002, moved repeatedly between the two study sites over a period of nearly ten years, sometimes being sighted in both areas in the same season.Bertulli, C. G., M. H. Rasmussen and M. J. Tetley. (2013). "Photo-identification rate and wide-scale movement of common minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the coastal waters of Faxaflói and Skjálfandi Bays, Iceland". Journal of Cetacean Research and Management 13 (1): 39-46

====Migration====

Three minke whales tagged off Iceland showed large-scale movements. One tagged off the north coast on 20 August 2002 first moved northeast of Iceland on 31 October before heading south, reaching 56° N, 27° W on 8 November. Another, tagged in Faxaflói Bay on 14 September 2004, turned south along the Reykjanes Ridge about two weeks later; its last signal was received on 8 October at about 50° N, 34° W. The third traveled the greatest distance. After being tagged in Faxaflói Bay on 27 August 2004 its first signal wasn’t received until 17 November, when it was over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, 900 km (559 mi) west of northern Spain. Its next position was transmitted six days later, some 700 km (435 mi) to the south, around the Azores, while its last signal was received on 5 December along the Canary Current, 1,000 km (621 mi) northwest of the Cape Verde Islands. In all, it traveled 3700 km (2299 mi) from its tagging location in a little over 100 days.Víkingsson, G. A. and M. P. Heide-Jørgensen. (2013). "Migration and local movements of common minke whales tracked by satellite in the North Atlantic during 2001-2010". Reports of the International Whaling Commission's Icelandic Special Meeting, pp. 1-12.

==Biology==

===Reproduction===

Common minke whales are sexually mature at about six to eight years of age for females and about six to seven years for males.Olsen, E., and J. Sunde. (2002). "Age determination of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) using the aspartic acid racemization technique". Sarsia: North Atlantic Marine Science 87 (1), 1-8. After a gestation period of 10 months, a single 2.6 m (8.5 ft) calf is born – only one out of 79 mature females during a study of minke whales off Iceland had twin fetuses, an 8.7 m (28.5 ft) female caught in July 2006 which had a 34 cm (13.4 in) male and a 32 cm (12.6 in) female. The calf is weaned after a period of six months. Peak conception is February in the North Atlantic, late February to mid-March for the "O stock" (which migrates along the eastern coast of Japan to the Okhotsk Sea), and between October and November for the "J stock" (which occurs in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and Sea of Japan, and migrates to the southern Okhotsk Sea in the spring, where it mixes with the O stock). Peak calving is December in the North Atlantic, December to January in the North Pacific, and May to July for the J stock.Evans, Peter G. H. (1987). The Natural History of Whales and Dolphins. Facts on File. The calving interval is only a year, so females are often simultaneously pregnant and lactating. Females reach physical maturity perhaps as early as 13 years of age; another study suggested that growth ceases for both sexes when they have 15 to 20 growth layers in their tympanic bullae, which may correspond to about 15 to 20 years of age. Both sexes can live to about 50 years of age – the oldest in a study of Icelandic minke whales were 42 years for females and 47 years for males, respectively.

===Prey===

Common minke whales have been described as ichthyophagous, but their diet also includes pelagic crustaceans and cephalopods and varies by region, season, and year. 

====North Atlantic====

In the North Atlantic, they primarily eat small schooling fish, demersal fish, and krill. A 2007 study showed that off Spitsbergen they fed almost exclusively on members of the euphausiid genus Thysanoessa (mainly T. inermis), but nearly a fifth also fed on small amounts of capelin. A small percentage of individuals, by decreasing frequency, also fed on polar cod, Atlantic cod, haddock, and copepods. Capelin dominated off Bear Island and in the southern Barents Sea, accounting for about three-quarters of their diet in both regions. Nearly half (nearly 46 per cent) also consumed euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp.) in the former area – haddock (12.5%), blue whiting (8.3%), polar cod, Atlantic cod, Atlantic herring, and copepods constituted the rest. Herring and haddock were also taken in the southern Barents Sea (accounting for 41.5 and 28.7 per cent by frequency of occurrence, respectively), while sandeel (Ammodytes spp.), Atlantic cod, copepods, euphausiids, pollock, and blue whiting made up the rest of the diet. In the Norwegian Sea, herring was found in all individuals sampled (n= 10), with some (20 per cent each) also feeding on a small amount of capelin and blue whiting – an earlier study, based on data primarily obtained between 1943-1945, showed that they fed exclusively on herring off Vesterålen, while the diet off Lofoten was more varied, including herring (34 per cent by occurrence), pelagic crustaceans (23%), Atlantic cod (22%), haddock (6%), and a mixture of coalfish and flatfish for one individual (1.5%).Windsland, K., Lindstrom, U., Nilssen, K. T., and T. Haug. (2007). "Relative abundance and size composition of prey in the common minke whale diet in selected areas of the northeastern Atlantic during 2000–04". Journal of Cetacean Research and Management 9: 167-178.Jonsgård, A. (1982). "The food of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in northern North Atlantic waters". Report of the International Whaling Commission 32: 259-262. In the North Sea, they primarily fed on sandeel (62%) and Atlantic mackerel (nearly 30%), with some feeding on herring (16.2%), small amounts of Mueller's pearlside (10.8%), copepods, haddock, capelin, and whiting. They were found to feed almost exclusively on Atlantic mackerel in the northern North Sea, while the same was true for sandeel in the eastern North Sea. Off Iceland, they mainly fed on sandeel (nearly 58 per cent of sampled individuals), haddock (22.6%), herring (20%), capelin (19.4%), and Atlantic cod (14.7%), with the rest of the diet consisting of euphausiids, various larger species of gadiods, and Norway pout. Sandeel was more important in southern Iceland (constituting 78 per cent of sampled individuals), while capelin (35.1%), haddock (28.7%), and cod (22.3%) were more important in the north. Euphausiids were only consumed in the north. Although haddock was only a minor part of the diet the first couple years of the study (0 and 4% in 2003 and 2004, respectively), it subsequently constituted a major component of it (31-35% in 2005-2007), while sandeel's importance in the south declined considerably (95.2 to 77.7% from 2003-2006, but only 18.1% in 2007).Víkingsson, G., B. Elvarsson, V. Chosson, and D. Olafsdottir. (2013). "Recent changes in the diet composition of common minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in Icelandic waters – Consequence of climate change?" Reports of the International Whaling Commission 65: 1-31. Off southeastern Greenland, they only fed on capelin, while sandeel dominated off southwestern Greenland. In a sample of 172 minke whales caught off Newfoundland between 1966 and 1972, the vast majority (85%) fed only on fish, mainly capelin. Some fed on a mixture of capelin and cod, while others had only consumed cod. Other gadiods, herring, krill, and squid formed the rest of the diet.Mitchell, E. (1974). "Preliminary report on Newfoundland fishery for minke whales". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 24: 159-176.

====North Pacific====

In the North Pacific, small schooling fish and krill are major food items. They feed exclusively on Pacific herring in the northern Okhotsk Sea and only on Alaska pollock east of Sakhalin Island. Japanese mackerel (found in 61 per cent of sampled stomachs) and Pacific saury (18%) are consumed east of the southern Kuril Islands, with only the former species being found in whales sampled in September and the latter species likewise only being found in whales taken in October. Euphausiids make up nearly two-thirds of the diet (62%) around the western Aleutian Islands, with unidentified fish (19%) constituting most of the rest. On the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido they mainly feed on euphausiids (55%), but also take sardine (24%) and sand lance (13%); on the Pacific side of Hokkaido, they feed almost exclusively on sardine (99%). In Sanriku, sardine makes up the bulk of the diet (54%), but euphausiids also play an important part (32%) – only a small percentage (9%) fed on sand lance. Euphausiids were a major food item on the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido and off Sanriku in the spring (71, 72 and 62% from April–June in the former area, and 83% in April in the latter area), while sardine dominated the diet in the summer in both areas (71% in September for the former region, and 70, 92, and 93% from May–July in the latter region).Kasamatsu, F. and T. Hata. (1985). "Notes on minke whales in the Okhotsk Sea-West Pacific area". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 36: 299-304. More recent data from Japanese scientific catches in the western North Pacific shows Japanese anchovy to be a major component of the diet in two of the three sub-areas (60 per cent by weight in sub-area 7 and 37.4% in sub-area 8), while Pacific saury was the major food item in sub-area 9 (64.6%) and played an important part of the diet in sub-area 8 (36.4%). Euphausiids (9.2% in all areas combined), Alaska pollock (7.8% in sub-area 7), minimal armhook squid (4.9% in sub-area 9), and mackerel were also consumed.Tamura, T., Konishi, K., Isoda, T., and P. Okamoto. (2009). "Prey consumption and feeding habits of common minke, sei and Bryde's whales in the western North Pacific". NAMMCO/SC/16/MMFI/07. They are thought to feed on juvenile herring and probably sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) around the San Juan Islands, while in the Monterey Bay region they have been observed feeding on baitfish – probably northern anchovy, which is abundant there.

====Southern Hemisphere====

In the Southern Ocean, dwarf minkes feed mainly on myctophid fishes.Perrin, W. F., Bernd G. Würsig, and J. G. M. Thewissen. 2009. Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Academic Press. An immature female caught in the sub-antarctic had euphausiids in its stomach, while two pregnant females from the same area had consumed fish and a mature male only had myctophids in its stomach.Kasamatsu, F., Yamamoto, Y., Zenitani, R., Ishikawa, H., Ishibashi, T., Sato, H., Takashima, K. and Tanifuji, S. (1993). "Report of the 1990/91 southern minke whale research cruise under scientific permit in Area V". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 43: 505-522Kato, H., Hiroyama, H., Fujise, Y. and Ono, K. (1989). "Preliminary report of the 1987/88 Japanese feasibility study of the special permit proposal for Southern Hemisphere minke whales". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 39: 235-248. An immature male caught in a gillnet off southern Brazil had a stomach almost filled with the euphausiid Euphausia similis.Secchi, E. R., Barcellos, L., Zerbini, A. N., and Dalla Rosa, L. (2003). "Biological observation on a dwarf minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), caught in southern Brazilian waters, with a new record of prey for the species". Latin American Journal of Aquatic Mammals 2 (2), 109-115.

===Predation===

There have been numerous recorded instances of killer whales attacking common minke whales in places such as the Kamchatka Peninsula, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington State, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Greenland.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2907.1991.tb00291.x|last1=Jefferson |first1=T. A.|last2=Stacey|first2=P.J.|last3=Baird|first3=R.W.|year=1991|url=http://swfsc.noaa.gov/uploadedFiles/Divisions/PRD/Publications/Jeffersonetal.1991(8).pdf|format=PDF|title=A review of killer whale interactions with other marine mammals: predation to co-existence|journal=Mammal Review|volume=21|pages=151–180|issue=4[/tpl]Ford, J. K., and R. R. Reeves. (2008). "Fight or flight: antipredator strategies of baleen whales". Mammal Review 38 (1), 50-86. They are normally able to outpace pursuing killer whales in open water or are trapped in a bay, where they are rammed and drowned or strand and die – in one instance a minke whale was able to refloat itself on the rising tide and swim away. Chases usually last about 30 minutes to an hour and can reach speeds of up 30 km/hr (18.6 mph), often with both species porpoising out of the water in low-angle leaps. Typically two to four killer whales and a lone minke are involved. If the pursuing killer whales do catch up to the minke it does not defend itself, which is typical of the fast-moving members of its genus. On two occasions fleeing minkes sought shelter under a boat, once off Yakutat, Alaska, in 1977 and again in Glacier Bay, Alaska, in 1996 – in both instances they were attacked and killed. Killer whales typically only eat the tongue, skin, and some of the blubber of the minkes they kill.Ford, J. K., Ellis, G. M., Matkin, D. R., Balcomb, K. C., Briggs, D., and Morton, A. B. (2005). "Killer whale attacks on minke whales: prey capture and antipredator tactics". Marine Mammal Science 21 (4), 603-618.
===Scavenging=== 
Greenland sharks have been found scavenging the blubber thrown overboard during Norwegian minke whaling operations off Svalbard. Leclerc, L. M., Lydersen, C., Haug, T., Glover, K. A., Fisk, A. T., and Kovacs, K. M. (2011). "Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) scavenge offal from minke (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) whaling operations in Svalbard (Norway)". Polar Research 30 (1), pp. 1-4.

===Parasites and epibiotics===

Common minke whales are a host to a number of internal and external parasites, as well as commensals, and other epibiotic fauna. Off Iceland, 45.2 per cent (85 of 188) of sampled minke whales bore old scars from attacks by the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, while a further 10.6 per cent had fresh scars on the posterior part of their flanks; five were found with live lampreys still clinging to their flesh. The copepod Caligus elongatus was found on 11.9 per cent of individuals, with a mean intensity (M. I.) of 95.5 per whale – the monogenean hyperparasite Udonella caligorum was also found attached to 22 (6.6%) of a sub-sample of 332 C. elongatus. Another copepod, Pennella balaenopterae, was found anchored into the flesh of 10.3 per cent of the whales (M. I. 1.6, with a maximum of five). The whale louse Cyamus balaenopterae was found on the skin of 6.5 per cent of the whales (M.I. 37), while the pseudo-stalked barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis was found on the flukes of three whales (M.I. 5.3). A single individual of the goose barnacle Conchoderma auritum was found attached to a baleen plate that belonged to a 7.9 m (25.9 ft) male caught off the northwest coast in 2005, while four C. virgatum were found attached to a specimen of P. balaenopterae on a 5.3 m (17.4 ft) female caught off the north coast in 2003.Ólafsdóttir, D., and A. P. Shinn. (2013). "Epibiotic macrofauna on common minke whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata Lacépède, 1804, in Icelandic waters". Parasites & vectors 6 (1), 105.
Among a sample of 100 minke whales caught in the western North Pacific in 1995, 78% had the copepod P. balaenopterae anchored into their skin and blubber – the goose barnacle C. virgatum was found attached to P. balaenopterae on three of the whales. The whale louse C. balaenopterae was found on the skin of four whales, while a single whale had the pseudo-stalked barnacle X. globicipitis attached to its skin. All individuals sampled were infected with the nematode Anisakis simplex in their stomachs (sometimes their small intestine) and the acanthocephalan Bolbosoma nipponicum in their small intestine. Other internal parasites included the cestodes Diphyllobothrium macroovatum, Diplogonoporus balaenopterae, and Tetrabothius sp., which infected the small intestine and were found in 17 per cent of the sample (all three species combined).Araki, J., Kuramochi, T., Machida, M., Nagazawa, K., and Uchida, A. (1997). "A note on the parasite fauna of the western North Pacific minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata)". Report of the International Whaling Commission 47: 565-568.
An immature male dwarf minke whale that stranded on the Banks Peninsula, South Island, New Zealand, had a stomach heavily infested with the nematode Anisakis and cysts of the cestode genus Phyllobothrium encased in the boundary between its blubber and muscle, while an immature male caught in a gillnet off southern Brazil had a stomach heavily infested with nematodes of the genera Pseudoterranova (about 97%) and Anisakis (about 3%).

==Behavior==

Common minke whales are normally seen singly. In the San Juan Islands, although up to six whales could be seen in a feeding area at once they usually acted independently, with no indications of cooperative feeding like that observed in their larger relatives the humpback and fin whale. On occasion, two whales could be seen surfacing at the same time, within one or two body lengths of each other – such associations could last for only one surfacing to as long as about 90 minutes. Only once were three individuals seen together for a couple surfacings. In the Monterey Bay area, usually only one whale was visible at a time; on only four occasions were two whales seen swimming together. On several occasions in the Johnstone Strait area pairs and trios were briefly seen surfacing together. No cow-calf pairs were observed in any of the three areas. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence and off Western Greenland, almost all sightings involved single whales. Off Iceland, the majority of sightings (93%) were of lone whales, with only a minority of the encounters including pairs (4%) or trios (less than 3%). No cow-calf pairs were seen here as well.Sigurjónsson J., Gunnlaugsson Th., Ensor, P., Newcomer, M. and Víkingsson, G. (1991). "North Atlantic sightings survey 1989 (NASS-89): shipboard surveys in Icelandic and adjacent waters July-August 1989". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 41: 559-572. Of 89 sightings in the Okhotsk Sea and Northwest Pacific, 80 were of solitary whales, seven of pairs, and one each involved groups of four and five whales.
Northern minke whales occasionally breach, sometimes completely clearing the water – one individual in the Johnstone Strait area reacted to the approach of foraging killer whales by breaching eight times in rapid succession.
The majority of sightings of dwarf minke whales on the Great Barrier Reef involved either single whales (53.3%) or pairs (28.9%), with the maximum number of individuals in a group being eight. Four cow-calf pairs were seen as well. Individuals encountered on the various reef systems there often approached dive boats and circled them as well as the divers in the water. They were also seen breaching. Off Brazil, groups normally only consisted of one or two individuals, which actively avoided whale watching boats and fishing vessels. Here they were seen to associate with feeding flocks of seabirds, usually brown boobies but also kelp gulls and terns on occasion.Hassel, L. B., Venturotti, A., Magalhães, F. A., Cuenca, S., Siciliano, S., and Marques, F. F. (2003). "Summer sightings of dwarf minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) off the eastern coast of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil". Latin American Journal of Aquatic Mammals 2 (1): 47-50.

===Surfacing sequence===

When a minke whale first comes to the surface to breathe its pointed rostrum is the first to break the surface. It either exhales beforehand or a narrow, diffuse blow or a low, bushy, diffuse blow is visible. It then arches its back in a quick motion, exaggerating this arch during its terminal deep dive. Often the blowholes and dorsal fin are visible at the same time. Depending on its behavior, it may exhale anywhere from one to seven times in rapid succession before going on a longer dive of several minutes duration. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, this depended on whether a whale was traveling, searching, or feeding. During traveling, when the whale was slower moving (generally in a straight line), it would exhale the greatest number of times (6.44 on average) and dive for a longer period of time (3.67 minutes on average) than when it was feeding, which was characterized by constant change in direction and vigorous swimming – this normally involved one or two respirations interspersed with three to seven (2.27 on average) followed by a relatively short dive (1.36 minutes on average). When a whale was searching, on the other hand (which involved the whale moving at a faster speed than traveling in a sort of zigzag motion), it would exhale 3.22 times on average and dive the longest of the three modes (3.76 minutes on average).Lynas, E. M., & Sylvestre, J. P. (1988). "Feeding techniques and foraging strategies of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the St. Lawrence River estuary". Aquatic Mammals 14 (1), 21-32.
In the Monterey Bay area, focal follows of minke whales showed that they respired an average of 3.74 times during a surfacing sequence. These short duration dives averaged 37.8 seconds and were followed by a long duration dive of an average of 4.43 minutes.Stern, J. S. (1992). "Surfacing rates and surfacing patterns of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) off central California, and the probability of a whale surfacing within visual range. Reports of the International Whaling Commission 42: 379-385. In the San Juan Islands, the number of exhalations and the duration of dives depended on whether the whale was lunge feeding or feeding with birds. In the former method of feeding, whales made short dives – about 22 seconds long – up to seven times in rapid succession before making a long dive of about 3.8 minutes, while during the latter method they made longer short dives of about 65 seconds followed by shorter long dives of about 1.5 minutes.

===Feeding techniques===

In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, minke whales exhibit three types of behaviors: entrapment maneuvers, engulfment maneuvers, and entrapment/engulfment maneuvers. Entrapment maneuvers include circles, gyres, ellipses, figure-of-eights, and hyperbolas. Circles involve a whale, lying on its side with its ventral surface facing its intended prey, swimming in a circle 1.5 to 2.5 times its diameter and lunging mouth agape across the diameter of this circle. As the whale mounts the water column the movement of its flukes create a print or trace. Gyres are larger versions of circles that steadily decrease in diameter as the whale performs each circuit. Ellipses cover a greater area than the former two maneuvers as the whale swims a long and short axis – the former can be greater than 100 m (328 ft) at times. Ellipses can be maintained for long periods of time and may include feeding circles within them as well as a number of engulfing maneuvers. Unlike circles, surface traces are rarely apparent. Figure-of-eights are smaller versions of ellipses, with a long axis of less than six body lengths. The whale turns in opposite directions at each end of the long axis. Hyperbolas involve the whale turning at least once at the end of a short straight line run – this maneuver is sometimes performed alongside a rock face, followed by an inward facing feeding lunge.
Engulfment maneuvers include plunges, oblique, lateral, vertical and ventral lunges. During plunges the whale approaches the water at an angle of less than 30° with its ventral surface facing downwards. Usually only the rostrum and part of the lower lip are visible above the surface of the water as it breaks the surface and often the tops of the extended ventral pleats. Oblique lunges are executed at a greater angle (about 45°) and entirely expose the extended ventral pleats; at times the entire body exits the water in a low, porpoising-like breach. During a lateral lunge the whale breaks the surface on its side, while during vertical and ventral lunges the whale exits the water at a 90° angle and while on its back, respectively.
Entrapment/engulfment maneuvers include horizontal, lateral and ventral arcs. During a horizontal arc a whale turns sharply – on either side – with only a pectoral fin or occasionally a tip of the flukes breaking the surface of the water. Lateral and ventral arcs are similar to lateral and ventral lunges, but without any part of the whale breaking the surface of the water. All three of these maneuvers have been observed with both expanded and unexpanded ventral pleats.
Plunges were used the most often (22% of the time), followed by ventral (19%), lateral (17%), and oblique lunges (15%). Vertical lunges were infrequently utilized (only 5% of the time), as were horizontal (7%), ventral (6%), and lateral arcs (3%).
Novel feeding techniques were observed during a study of five individually identified minke whales (named M1 to M5) in the Saguenay Fjord National Park, on the north side of the St. Lawrence estuary, from June to October 2003. These maneuvers included head slaps, chip-up blows, and exhales on the dive. During a head slap, the whale would raise its head high out of the water at angle of about 30 to 45°, take a quick breath, and then slam its head onto the water, creating a loud splash. It would do this without expanding its ventral pleats or forcing water out of its mouth. After doing several head slaps the whale would perform a feeding lunge. Head slaps were used almost exclusively by M4 and M5. A chin-up blow is similar to a normal surfacing but more energetic and executed at a greater angle as the whale comes high out of the water to breathe and dive again in one continuous motion without slapping the surface of the water. Chin-up blows were utilized often and performed by all five whales; it was the principal technique used by M1, M2, and M3 prior to a feeding lunge. An exhale on the dive is exactly what its name implies: a whale exhaling as its blowholes submerge. This resulted in a large volume of water being displaced and typically followed a normal blow or a chin-up blow and on occasion a head slap. This technique was only executed by M1 and M5. These new techniques are thought to have been developed by these whales to help them herd small schooling fish (likely capelin) in the well-mixed waters of the Saguenay Fjord; these tactics were not observed in the nearby Laurentian Channel Head, where "strong tidal currents, a stratified water column and bottom topography combine to create large areas of upwelling in which prey are forced to the surface".Kuker, K. J., Thomson, J. A., and Tscherter, U. (2005). "Novel surface feeding tactics of minke whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, in the Saguenay-St. Lawrence National Marine Park". The Canadian Field-Naturalist 119 (2): 214-218.
In July 2007, a minke whale with what appeared to be a rope injury was observed surface feeding on capelin in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The long, linear laceration extended around the ventral pleats, restricting their distention. This individual performed a number of oblique lunges on its right side and then rotated in mid-air to the left, landing upright on its rostrum. This was not observed in any of the other feeding whales. This may have been done to avoid landing on the injured portion of its ventral pleats.Kot, B. W., Ramp, C., & Sears, R. (2009). "Decreased feeding ability of a minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) with entanglement-like injuries". Marine Mammal Science 25 (3): 706-713.

==Whaling==

===North Atlantic===

Whaling was mentioned in Norwegian written sources as early as the year 800 and hunting common minke whales with harpoons was common in the 11th century[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl].
Norwegian catching of minke whales from small fishing vessels started off Møre, western Norway, in the 1920s. It had spread north to Salten by 1932 and all along the Norwegian coast by the late 1930s. Licenses were introduced in 1938. Just after World War II the trade had reached Spitsbergen and by about 1950 had spread to the Barents Sea, where 1,676 whales were caught in 1952 alone (nearly half the total catch that season). Catches in the latter area begin to decline by about 1960. A westward expansion to the waters north and east of Iceland occurred; by 1966 they had reached the Denmark Strait and western Greenland just two years later. At its peak over 300 vessels participated in the hunt each season, but this declined to about 50 in the 1980s. By the end of the Second World War the catch was at nearly 2,000 per annum, peaked at 4,338 in 1958, and declined to 2,307 by 1970.Christensen, I. And N. Øien. (1990). "Operational patterns of the Norwegian minke whale fishery". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 40: 343-347.[tpl]cite book | author = Jonsgard, A. | year = 1974 | chapter = On whale exploitation in the eastern part of the North Atlantic Ocean | pages = 97–107 | editor = W.E. Schevill (ed.) | title = The Whale Problem: A Status Report | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn= 0-674-95075-5 [/tpl] About 120,000 have been caught since 1948. None were taken from 1984 to 1987, in accordance with a moratorium against commercial whaling voted on by the International Whaling Commission in 1982 and to take effect in 1986. From 1988 to 1990 and again from 1992 to 1994 Norway caught minke whales under scientific permit and resumed commercial whaling of the species in 1993. They typically catch 450 to 600 individuals a year, with 464 being taken in 2012.
Minke whales were first caught off Iceland in 1914 by the powered 4-ton fishing vessel Margrét IS 314, which was mounted with a 1.5 inch bore harpoon gun – this was replaced in 1923 with a 2-inch bore harpoon gun manufactured in Norway. Later other vessels joined the trade. Operations were limited to coastal waters, normally within 30 nautical miles of shore. The season extended from the beginning of March to late November, even to early December at times; though most were caught between April and October. They were mainly caught for their meat, with a minimum of 3,362 being taken between 1914 and 1980. Catch limits were introduced in 1977. The average annual catch rose from 105 from 1966 to 1970, to 137 from 1971-1975, and finally to 200 from 1976 to 1980.Sigurjónsson, J. (1982). "Icelandic minke whaling 1914-1980". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 32: 287-295. The last were caught in 1985 before whaling resumed in 2003 under scientific permit, with 200 being taken from 2003 to 2007. Commercial whaling for minkes was renewed in 2006, with a total catch of 296 between 2006 and 2012.
A Newfoundland whaling company began catching "little piked whales" (minke whales) off northeastern Newfoundland in 1947, taking 16 in its first year and 41 in 1948. A total of 812 minke whales were caught off Newfoundland between 1947 and 1972, with a peak of 97 in 1972. They were captured by one to three 12.2 to 15.2 m (40 to 50 ft) wood-hulled vessels that had a 50 mm harpoon cannon mounted on their bows. Whales were towed to a shore station for flensing. They were first caught in Conception, Bonavista, and Trinity bays, but later catches (1966 to 1972) were mainly made in Trinity Bay itself. The season extended from May to September (rarely October), with peak catches being made in June and July. A small number – 51 between 1962 and 1967 – were also caught off Nova Scotia, with the season lasting from June to August.
Minke whales were first exploited by Greenlanders off western Greenland in 1948, when a fishing vessel mounted with a harpoon cannon began catching them. This vessel averaged 18 whales per annum (range four to 32), before being joined by three other vessels in 1958. The number of vessels participating in the hunt each year increased rapidly, rising from 18 in 1963, to 25 in 1964, and to 45 in 1965. The peak was reached in 1968 and 1969, with 56 vessels active in both years. From 1970 to 1976 the average fluctuated between about 30 and 45 vessels. A total of 3,434 minke whales were taken off western Greenland between 1948 and 1976, with a peak of 315 reached in 1968. The vast majority of these whales were taken by fishing vessels normally targeting cod, shrimp, or salmon, but an increasing number in later years were caught using a number of small boats with out-board motors, armed with high-powered rifles for killing the whale and hand-held harpoons and floating bladders to secure them; walkie-talkies were used for coordination. Usage of this method, called a "collective catch", increased from a catch of just one whale in 1970 to 59 in 1975. Minke whales were caught for their meat, with it mainly being used locally for human consumption and dog food, though in Umanak the Royal Greenland Trading Department purchased some of the products of the hunt beginning in the late 1960s.Kapel, F.O. (1977). "Catch statistics for minke whales, West Greenland, 1954-74". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 27: 456-459.Kapel, F.O. (1978). "Catch of minke whales by fishing vessels in West Greenland". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 28: 217-226. An additional 4,307 minke whales were caught off Greenland between 1985 and 2012, 4,070 off western Greenland and a paltry 237 off eastern Greenland. The average annual catch during this period has usually been between 150 and 190 whales.
A total of 97 were caught off the Faroe Islands between 1960 and 1971, with a peak of 32 in 1968. One was also taken off Portugal in 1951.Jonsgård, Å. (1977). "Tables showing the catch of small whales (including minke whales) caught by Norwegians in the period 1938-75, and large whales caught in different North Atlantic waters in the period 1868-1975". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 27: 413-26.

===North Pacific===

There is no evidence minke whales were caught in Japan during the harpoon and net whaling eras.Nasu, K. (1992). "Catches of Minke Whales during the Ancient Whaling Era in Japan with a Note on pre-World War II Catches by Modern Whaling". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 42: 429. The small-type catcher boat Yuko-maru 7 GRT caught the first minkes out of Akukawa in 1930. In the first half of the 1930s, about 20-30 was taken per year out of this port. Minke whaling soon spread to the port of Kamaishi (1938), on the northeast coast of Honshu; Ogawajima (about 1951), on the west coast of Kyushu; and to Wakasa Bay and Aomori (both by 1957), the former on the west coast and the latter on the north coast of Honshu. Several hundred were caught each year, with the peak being reached in 1956, when 532 were taken. About 13,000 were taken by Japanese coastal whaling between 1948 and 1987. Most were caught off Sanriku and on the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido, with the Pacific side of Hokkaido gaining some importance by the early 1970s. They were seldom caught off the west coast of Honshu (off Tottori, in Tsuruga Bay, and Toyama Bay), which was abandoned by the mid-1970s. Few were taken on the Sea of Japan side of Hokkaido as well. They were formerly captured off western Kyushu and the south coasts of Honshu and Shikoku, but catching in those regions ceased by 1965 due to the scarcity of whales. The first minkes of the season were caught off western Kyushu and the Sea of Japan side of Honshu, where peak catches occurred from March to May and March to April, respectively; from there effort shifted to the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido and Sanriku, where catches peaked in May for the former area and from April to May in the latter area. Effort was finally diverted to the Pacific side of Hokkaido, where peak catches were made from July to September. The season as a whole extended from February to October.Ohsumi, S. (1977). "Catch of minke whales in the coastal waters of Japan". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 27: 164-166.Oshumi, S. (1978). "A note on minke whales in the coastal waters of Japan". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 29: 271-272.Ohsumi, S. (1982). "Minke whales in the coastal waters of Japan, 1980 and a population assessment of the Okhotsk Sea-West Pacific stock". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 32: 283-6.Ohsumi, S. (1983). "Minke whales in the coastal waters of Japan in 1981, with special reference to their stock boundary". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 33: 365-372.
In 1973 a duel factory-catcher boat was built, the Miwa Maru, which caught 279 minke whales from 1973 to 1975, mainly in the Okhotsk Sea. Japanese pelagic fleets also caught six in the Gulf of Alaska, four in 1964 and two in 1971; an additional 22 were taken by pelagic fleets in the western North Pacific and western Bering Sea in 1969, 1970, and 1976.
Commercial catches ended in 1987. In 1994, Japan began catching minke whales in the western North Pacific under scientific permit. Under the title of JARPN (Japanese Research Program in the North), up to 100 whales were caught each year by a pelagic fleet until 1999. After a two-year feasibility study, JARPN II began in 2002, also taking up to 100 whales per year with a pelagic fleet but expanding its operations to include a coastal component, with a total of up to 120 individuals being caught off Sanriku in the spring and off Kushiro, on the Pacific side of Hokkaido, in the fall. This research program continues to the present.
Whaling for minke whales off Korea began in the early 1930s, when they were opportunistically caught by vessels targeting larger species. By the early 1960s a few hundred were being caught each year. The catch increased from 715 in 1970, to 882 in 1973, to a peak of 1,033 and 1,018 in 1977 and 1978. Minkes were caught almost year-round (February to December), with the most important whaling ground being the central Yellow Sea from March to April. From there, catches extended to the Korean Strait in May and the southwestern Sea of Japan from June to October. Most were caught from April to June, with a peak in the Yellow Sea in April and in the Sea of Japan in June. They were also caught in the northern Yellow Sea and off the east coast of North Korea (before 1936), where peak catches were reached from May to June and from April to June, respectively. About 16,000 were caught between 1940 and 1986, when hunting of minke whales ceased.Gong, Y. (1981). "Minke whales in the waters off Korea". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 31: 241-244.Brownell Jr, R. L. (1981). "Review of coastal whaling by the Republic of Korea". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 31: 395-402.
A small number of minke whales were caught by the Soviets in the western North Pacific, with 21 being taken by pelagic fleets between 1933 and 1979 and an additional 94 being caught by catchers operating out of the Kuril Island land stations – the annual catch in the latter region never exceeded nine or ten whales (1951, 1954, and 1956).

===Southern Hemisphere===

Few dwarf minke whales have been reported taken by whaling operations. Thirteen were caught off Durban, South Africa, between 1968 and 1975. Of 902 minke whales caught off northeastern Brazil in 1980, only three were dwarf.Da Rocha, J. M. and Braga, N. M. A. 1982. "Brazil Progress Report on cetacean research, June 1980 to May 1981". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 32: 155-159. Of 1,789 minke whales caught in the Southern Ocean by the Japanese between 1987-88 and 1992-93, only 16 were dwarf minkes (one was caught in 1987-88, five in 1988-89, three in 1989-90, four in 1990-91, and three in 1992-93).Nishiwaki, S., Ishikawa, H. and Fujise, Y. (2005). "Review of the general methodology and survey procedure under JARPA". Paper JA/J05/JR2 presented at the pre-JARPA review meeting, Tokyo, January 2005. These were taken between the latitudes of 55°22' S and 65°04' S and the longitudes of 111°26' E and 178°12' E.Kato, H., Fujise, Y., Yoshida, H., Nakagawa, S., Ishida, M. and Tanifuji, S. (1990). "Cruise report and preliminary analysis of the 1988/89 Japanese feasibility study of the special permit proposal for southern hemisphere minke whales". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 40: 289-300. An additional 180 minke whales (47 males, 133 females) which had flippers with a "clear white band" were taken by Japanese expeditions in the sub-antarctic between 1972-73 and 1976-77, with a peak of 69 in 1975-76.Wada, S., & Numachi, K. (1979). "External and biochemical characters as an approach to stock identification for the Antarctic minke whale". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 29: 421-32.

==Other mortality==

Minke whales are occasionally caught in fishing gear of various types, including set nets, fish pots, gillnets, trap nets, trawls, longlines, and seines. Entanglements have been reported off Korea,An, Y. R., Choi, S. G., & Moon, D. Y. (2010). "A review on the status of bycatch minke whales in Korean waters". IWC Scientific Committee (SC/62/NPM19). Available from the IWC. Japan,Tobayama T., Yanagisawa F., AND Kasuya T. (1992). "Incidental take of minke whales in Japanese trap nets". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 42: 433-443. Canada, the United States,Heyning, J. E., & Lewis, T. D. (1990). "Entanglements of baleen whales in fishing gear off southern California". Reports of the International Whaling Commission 40: 427-431. the Azores, Scotland, Portugal, France, Italy, Greece,Verriopoulou, A., Tounta, E.,and Dendrinos, P. (2001). "First report of a minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata Lacepede, 1804) in Hellenic waters". Aquatic Mammals 27 (2): 137-139. Tunisia, Israel, the Canary Islands, Senegal, and Brazil. A total of 1,156 minke whales were caught off Korea between 1996 and 2008, an average of about 88 per year. They were mainly caught with set nets (31.4%), fish pots (27.3%), and gillnets (26.2%). Most were juveniles. Of 17 individuals caught in trap nets off eastern Honshu between 1978 and 1990, only two escaped alive, the rest being sold for their meat.
In April 2007, a 4.08 m (13.4 ft) juvenile female minke whale died from domoic acid poisoning by ingesting northern anchovies – a known domoic acid vector – during an intense Pseudo-nitzschia bloom off Southern California.Fire, S. E., Wang, Z., Berman, M., Langlois, G. W., Morton, S. L., Sekula-Wood, E., and Benitez-Nelson, C. R. (2010). "Trophic transfer of the harmful algal toxin domoic acid as a cause of death in a minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) stranding in southern California". Aquatic Mammals 36 (4): 342-350.

==Common minke whale-watching==

Due to their relative abundance common minke whales are often the focus of whale-watching cruises setting sail from, for instance, the Isle of Mull in Scotland, County Cork in Ireland  and Húsavík in Iceland. Common minke whales are frequently inquisitive and will indulge in "human-watching". In contrast to the spectacularly acrobatic humpback whale, minkes do not raise their fluke out of the water when diving and are less likely to breach. Minkes can stay submerged for as long as twenty minutes.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]

==Conservation status==

The common minke whale is considered "Least Concern" on the IUCN red list.
In addition, the species is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS)
