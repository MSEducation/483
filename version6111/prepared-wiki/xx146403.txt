Pertisau is a small village on the Achensee Lake in the Tyrol region of Austria.
Pertisau is in the Schwaz (district).  It is located in the Karwendel Alpine Park, one of the oldest, cross-border, protected areas of the Eastern Alps. 
The picturesque town was used by English school story writer Elinor M. Brent-Dyer as the first setting for her Chalet School series, under the fictionalised name of Briesau am Tiernsee; a plaque on the wall of the village bookshop commemorates her writings.Friends of the Chalet School: Locations
Pertisau is also the center for the Achensee shipping business.  Ships start their journey along the lake from Pertisau and connect the villages around the lake with the Achenseebahn rack and pinion railway at Seespitz Station.

The parish church is the work of the Austrian architect Clemens Holzmeister.  Pertisau is also the location of the Fürstenhaus, a country residence of Emperor Maximilian I of Austria.
