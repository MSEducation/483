[[Vailimia]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Vailimia is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Its only species occurs only in Borneo.
The species was originally described from a single male in 1907, which is about six millimeters long, and said to be close to Harmochirus. However, the male pedipalp, chelicera and cephalothorax drawn by Proszynski (1984), and recently collected specimens indicate otherwise.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 273

==Name==

Vailima is the name of the last residence of Robert Louis Stevenson and the village where it is situated. The genus was renamed to Vailimia in 2006 due to a conflict with a fish genus, Vailima. The original name Vailima was used by Peckham & Peckham, 1907.
