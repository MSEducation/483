[[Setjetting]]

CATEGORIES: Film, Types of tourism

Set-jetting is the trend of traveling to destinations that are first seen in movies.  Also referred to as a "Location Vacation".  For instance, touring London in a high-speed boat like James Bond, or visiting the stately homes that are seen in the Jane Austen films.  The term was first coined in the US press in the New York Post by journalist Gretchen Kelly.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/set_jetting_2IA9GEMZ2VSWSoDH5qdZ9M|title=THE SEXIEST FILM LOCATIONS FROM 2007 TO VISIT NOW|author=Gretchen Kelly|publisher=New York Post|accessdate=2009-11-05 | date=2008-02-19[/tpl]
Corporations, convention and tourism boards are exploiting the trend, creating their own set-jetting travel maps, like the Elizabeth: The Golden Age movie map published by VisitBritain.Film itineries from visitbritain.com[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl]
