Wuhan Airlines Flight 343 was a domestic scheduled passenger flight between Enshi Airport and Wuhan Tianhe International Airport, both in Hubei province, Central China. On June 22, 2000, the Wuhan Airlines Xian Y-7, registration B-3479, flying the route crashed after encountering an area of adverse weather; the aircraft was struck by lightning and encountered windshear.
Immediately after the accident, China ordered all of Wuhan Airlines' Xian Y-7 aircraft be grounded. One month after the accident, they were allowed to resume service. The cause was determined to be the adverse weather the aircraft encountered, specifically the lightning strike.
The accident remains the deadliest involving a Xian Y-7 aircraft, and is today the 12th deadliest aviation accident in the history of China.

==History==

The Wuhan Airlines Xian Y-7 aircraft departed Enshi Airport, on June 22, 2000, for a flight to Wuhan Tianhe International Airport. As the aircraft approached Wuhan, the flight crew were informed of adverse weather conditions in the area of the airport. The flight crew circled the airport for approximately 30 minutes, waiting for the weather to improve; during this time they debated whether to divert to another airport, but the pilot decided to continue to try and land at Wuhan.[tpl]cite web|title=Accident description|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20000622-0|publisher=Aviation Safety Network|accessdate=January 1, 2011[/tpl]
Weather stations recorded 451 thunderclaps in ten minutes during the 30 minute period the aircraft was circling above the airport.

==Grounding of Xian Y-7 aircraft==

In the aftermath of the accident, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) ordered all Wuhan Airlines' six other Xian Y-7 aircraft be grounded until the cause of the crash was determined. In July they were permitted to return to service after safety inspections were carried out and flight crews received more training. The CAAC ordered all Xian Y-7 aircraft be removed from scheduled passenger service by June 1, 2001.
