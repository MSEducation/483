The Big Texan Steak Ranch is a steakhouse restaurant and motel located in Amarillo, Texas, United States which opened on the previous U.S. Route 66 in the 4500 block of East Amarillo Boulevard in 1960 and moved to its present location on Interstate 40 in 1970. Fire gutted the west wing of the restaurant in 1976 and destroyed $100,000 in antiques. The restaurant reopened as a larger facility in 1977.  The building is painted a bright yellow, with blue trim. A large cow statue advertises their free 72 oz. steak (see below). The now-closed Texas Tornado Museum resided off in a far corner of the parking lot on the property.[tpl]cite news |first=Erin E. |last=Gruben |work=Texas Monthly |title=Happy Trails |url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/preview/2001-08-01/happytrails |date=August 2001[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.savvycenter.com/explorer/areas/infopages/bigsteak.htm |publisher=OutdoorFlix.com |title=Big Texan Steak Ranch[/tpl]

==The Texas King==

The Big Texan is best known for its 72 ounce (4.5 pounds or 2.04 kg) steak, nicknamed "The Texas King."  The steak is free to anyone who, in one hour or less, can eat the entire meal, consisting of the steak itself, plus bread roll with butter, baked potato, ranch beans, shrimp cocktail, and salad; otherwise, the meal costs $72.00.[tpl]cite web | title = The 72 Oz Steak Rules | publisher = The Big Texan | url = http://bigtexan.com/72oz-steak-rules/ | accessdate = 2013-08-17[/tpl]  Those who have successfully consumed the Texas King meal have their names recorded and posted at the restaurant.  As of March 15, 2011, over 8,800 people out of about 50,000 have accomplished this feat.
Those who take on the Texas King challenge are required to pay for the meal in advance, and if they are successful, their money is refunded.  The steak is cooked to the participant's preference, and the challenge takes place at a table for one on a raised platform in the middle of the main dining room.
The record for the shortest time needed to finish the entire Texas King meal is held by competitive eating champion Joey Chestnut.  He finished the challenge in 8 minutes and 52 seconds, breaking Frank Pastore's 1987 record (of 9½ minutes, which stood for 21 years) on his March 24, 2008 visit.  The unofficial record is held by a 500-pound Siberian Tiger, who ate the steak in 90 seconds.[tpl]cite video|people= Pettit, Mason (narrator) |title= Steak Paradise |url= http://www.travelchannel.com/Travel_Ideas/Food_and_Wine/ci.Steak_Paradise.artTravelIdeasFmt?vgnextfmt=artTravelIdeasFmt |medium=Television production |date= 2008-03-12 |publisher= Prometheus Entertainment for The Travel Channel |accessdate= 2008-06-22[/tpl]

In the Season 3 episode of King of the Hill "And they called it Bobby Love", the Steak Ranch was parodied with a similar restaurant called the "Panhandler Steakhouse". Bobby Hill accepts the challenge only to spite the girl that spurned his affections (who was also a vegetarian). He completes the challenge but upon returning home subsequently vomits.
