The Psychedelic Furs are an English rock band founded in 1977. Led by singer Richard Butler and his brother Tim Butler on bass guitar, the Psychedelic Furs are one of the many acts spawned from the British post-punk scene. Their music went through several phases, from an initially austere art rock sound, later touching on new wave and hard rock.
They scored several hits in their early career, but were launched to international attention in 1986 when the film director John Hughes used their song "Pretty in Pink" for his movie of the same name. A newly recorded version of the song became the Psychedlic Furs' biggest hit to that time. "Heartbreak Beat", from their 1987 album Midnight to Midnight, was the Furs' biggest Top 40 entry in the US.
The Psychedelic Furs went on hiatus in 1991, and the Butler brothers formed a new band called Love Spit Love.  The Psychedelic Furs later regrouped in 2001 and continue to perform around the world.

==Career==

===Early days and success===

The Psychedelic Furs came together in England's emerging punk scene in 1977, where they auditioned for Essex Kennedy's record label Manfactory Wave Punk.  He hoped to cash in on the punk scene that was sweeping the U.K and believed that a more produced and studio sound would appeal to a larger market.  They were initially called 'RKO', then 'Radio'. They then vacillated between calling themselves "The Europeans" and "The Psychedelic Furs," playing gigs under both names before permanently settling on the latter.[ref]
