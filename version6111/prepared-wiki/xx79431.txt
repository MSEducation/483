The Infinity Gauntlet is a six-issue comic book limited series published by Marvel Comics from July to December in 1991. The series was written by Jim Starlin and penciled by George Pérez and Ron Lim.

==Publication history==

The storyline is the culmination of events from Silver Surfer vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990) and the two-issue miniseries The Thanos Quest (Sept.- Oct. 1990). 
In 1991, artist George Pérez signed on to pencil the six-issue limited series. However, due to the emotional stresses Pérez was suffering from related to his concurrent work as writer/artist on DC Comics' Wonder Woman and as artist on the DC limited series War of the Gods,O'Neil, Patrick Daniel. "Spotlight: War of the Gods," David Anthony Kraft's Comics Interview #104 (1991), pp. 21-35. Cover title: "Pérez Quits DC!" Pérez was unable to finish penciling each issue of Infinity Gauntlet. Pérez left the project while working on issue #4, with penciler Ron Lim assigned to replace him. Pérez remained as the inker over Lim's cover art for the remainder of the miniseries.
Additional plotlines not addressed in the main story were featured in other books published during the same time period.   
The storyline led to two sequel miniseries, Infinity War and Infinity Crusade.  All three series were the core of a company-wide crossover story.

==Plot summary==

Thanos mounts the six Infinity Gems (collected in the Thanos Quest limited series) on his left glove to form the titular Infinity Gauntlet. Each Gem grants its bearer complete mastery over one aspect of the multiverse: Time, Space, Mind, Soul, Reality, and Power. Now all-powerful and desperate to win the affections of Death, Thanos decides to offer the entity a gift of love by completing a task she had given him, erasing half the sentient life in the universe (including most of the X-Men, Daredevil, and the Fantastic Four),The Infinity Gauntlet #2 (1991) quite literally with a snap of his fingers.
The surviving heroes on Earth band together—guided by the newly-resurrected Adam Warlock—to battle Thanos. In a bid to impress Death, Thanos allows the heroes a slight chance of winning, but easily defeats and kills almost all of them. Thanos then goes on to defeat and imprison many of the universe's cosmic entities—including Galactus; the Stranger; the Titan Kronos; Epoch; the entities Love and Hate; two Celestials; Master Order and Lord Chaos; and Eternity. After defeating Eternity, Thanos leaves his body and becomes the living embodiment of the universe. This leaves his abandoned body vulnerable to Nebula, his alleged granddaughter.
Nebula takes the Gauntlet off Thanos' hand and dons it herself; she then undoes all of Thanos' actions, restoring her from disfigurement, bringing the dead back to life, and reversing the damage done to the cosmos. Another battle with the heroes and cosmic deities ends with Adam Warlock taking possession of the Gauntlet, after which Thanos appears to commit suicide. Warlock's allies object when he plans to keep the gauntlet intact for himself, but he ignores them. Later, Warlock and his companions discover Thanos working at a farm while contemplating his loss and, satisfied that he is no longer a threat, decide to leave him be.

The Infinity Gauntlet is featured in several issues of the alternate universe title What If. The first explores the outcome if the Silver SurferWhat If? #49 (May 1993) and Impossible ManWhat If? #104 (Jan. 1998) respectively had possessed the artifact. A one-shot publication depicts a new version of the Fantastic Four - who replace the deceased original members - consisting of the Hulk; Iron Man; Spider-Man and Wolverine. The quartet successfully defeat Thanos when Wolverine distracts him by telling him how he should "touch" death to show her he cares. This allows Wolverine to cut off Thanos' gloved hand, Spider-Man subsequently undoes the damage Thanos had caused before giving the Gauntlet to the Watchers for safe keeping.What If?
