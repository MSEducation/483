==Controversy==

===Women in automobile sales===

In a 2003 interview with The Boston Globe, in response to the question, "Why don't more women sell cars?" Boch responded, "They don't apply.  They're intimidated by the industry.  It's totally male-dominated."[tpl]cite news |newspaper=The Boston Globe | first=Mark |last=Pothier |page=7 | title = Come on down: just because he runs the family's $1-billion-a-year car sales empire doesn't mean he likes auto dealers | date = 2003-07-27[/tpl]  This was perceived by at least one scholar of gender studies - Harvey Mansfield, the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Government at Harvard University, and former holder of the Guggenheim Fellowship and National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowships - to be a sexist remark. Dr. Mansfield referred to this quote as "a totally male interpretation of a kind rarely printed in the newspapers today."[tpl]cite book | first=Harvey Claflin| last=Mansfield | title = Manliness |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2007 |page=245 |isbn=978-0-300-12254-1 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=l30BXnXfH1kC&pg=PA245 |accessdate=2011-01-04[/tpl]
