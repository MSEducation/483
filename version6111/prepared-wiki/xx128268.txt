==Mall history==

Plans were first announced in June 1994. The original mall was intended to have Macy's, which had signed a letter of interest.[tpl]cite news|title=Macy's in Norfolk|last=Peck|first=Jeanne|date=June 1, 1994|work=Daily Press|accessdate=6 January 2013[/tpl]
The [tpl]convert|1100000|sqft|m2|sing=on[/tpl] structure is adjacent to the General Douglas MacArthur Memorial. It is anchored by Nordstrom and Dillard's department stores, with space for a third major anchor tenant. There are [tpl]convert|400000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of mall tenant shops and [tpl]convert|100000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of food and entertainment offerings, including the Regal MacArthur 18 movie theater.
The 140-store mall opened in March 1999, with the region's first Nordstrom department store anchor.

===MacArthur on Ice===

Every winter since 2005, MacArthur Center has operated a [tpl]convert|7200|sqft|m2|sing=on[/tpl] ice skating rink on the property.[tpl]Citation |last=Garrow |first=Hattie Brown |title=MacArthur Center's ice rink reopens for season 3 |url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/429731 |publisher=The Virginian-Pilot |date=2007-11-18 |accessdate=2007-11-23[/tpl]

===Parental Policy===

Since October 19, 2009, MacArthur Center is one of the few malls in Virginia and the one of three in the Taubman Company to implement a Parental Escort Policy that will ban teens under 18 without a 21+ year old escort daily after 5 p.m. This was met with a protesting opposition just before the rule went into effect.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fightmacarthur.com/|title=Fight MacArthur|accessdate=25 April 2010[/tpl]
