==Variations==

Standard birthstone rings feature the birthstone of the ring's wearer, but mother's rings include the birthstones of all of her children. In some cases the birthstones of the parents are also set in the ring. Some are also personalized with the names of family members, or the family name.
Similar rings, often featuring the birthstones of both her children and grandchildren, are sometimes given to grandmothers as well. These rings are popular Mother's Day gifts, and are often given to a mother or grandmother upon the birth of a new child or grandchild, both as a new ring or to replace an old one.
