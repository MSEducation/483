some adherents of the Orthodox Muslims: Ahl al-HadithAhl al-Hadith / Salafi movementSalafi movement shun them as an innovation, preferring to stick to the exact method believed to have been used by Muhammad. Muhammad ordered to count Zikr on Fingers and that the fingers will be questioned (Abu Dawood 1501).

==History==

It is thought that in the early Muslim era loose pebbles were used or that people counted on their fingers.
According to the 17th century allamah Muhammad Baqir Majlisi, after the Battle of Uhud, Fatimah would visit the Martyrs' Graveyard every two or three days and then made a misbaha of Hamza's tomb soil. After that, people started making and using Masbhas.[tpl]Fact|date=December 2008[/tpl] However some hdith state the benefit of using the fingers of the right hand to count tasbih.
It is said that the 33-bead masbaha represents, to Christians, the 33 years of Christ's earthly existence, while those of 99 beads represent the 33 years multiplied by the three manifestations of God the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
