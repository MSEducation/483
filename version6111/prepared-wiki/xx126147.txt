A lay leader is a member of the laity in any congregation who has been chosen as a leader. Welcome to Lay LeadershipUUA: Lay LeadershipHillel Names Lay Leadership Exemplars of Excellence Since lay leadership is not an ordained clerical office, the lay leader's responsibilities vary according to the particular tradition to which he or she belongs.  Some organizations do not allow the lay leader to give sacraments for example, but do allow them to perform most other portions of the service that are normally the responsibility of the clergy (e.g. giving sermons when the regular clergy are on vacation).
