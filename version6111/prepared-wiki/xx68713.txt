Riddrie (Scottish Gaelic: An Ruadh Ruigh) is a north eastern district of Glasgow, Scotland. It lies on the A80 Cumbernauld Road.
Riddrie is a residential area mainly consisting of 1930s semi-detached houses, originally built as council housing but now largely privately owned. The former Monkland Canal to the north was filled in the 1960s and is now the M8 motorway.  Riddrie is the site of Barlinnie Prison.
There is a library, bowling green and local shops. Bus services link Riddrie with Glasgow City Centre and Cumbernauld. Nearby is Hogganfield Loch, around which is a public park.
