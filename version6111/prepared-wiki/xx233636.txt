East High School lies in the heart of the Anchorage greenbelt offering spectacular views of the Chugach Mountains to the east and Mount McKinley to the north. The school opened in 1961 and it is the second oldest high school in the city. East High was also the home of Benson Junior High (named for Benny Benson, who drew the winning design for the Alaska State flag) for a period of time in the seventies. The 'new' part was built for East High and Benson Junior High (gym parking lot side). That is the reason for the "new" gym. The gym floor was state-of-the-art at the time. The old gym is now the current library.
Since its early years, EHS has become highly regarded for its varied cultural, socioeconomic, and multi-ethnic student body that celebrates the differences of its 2200 students. It meets these needs through a wide variety of course offerings and alternative programs.
The staff of approximately 200 teachers and support personnel combines their talent to propel their students into a district-wide position of leadership and academic excellence.
