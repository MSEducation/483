Milan but sent to Monza in co-ownership deal for 650 million lire (€335,697).AC Milan SpA Report and Accounts on 30 June 2001 [tpl]it icon[/tpl] He was bought back in June 2001 for 1 billion lire (€516,457).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.legaseriea.it/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=6af3672f-fbed-4eaa-8921-03384562bbae&groupId=10192|title=Comunicati Stampa N°175 (2000–01)|date=28 June 2001|accessdate=14 May 2012|work=Lega Calcio|publisher=Lega Serie A Archive|language=Italian[/tpl]The fee was indirectly stated in page.42 of financial report of the year ended on 30 June 2001, which the difference between new market value of the retained half and the historic value was €181,000 (as co-ownership income). Therefore, €336,000 plus €181,000 equal €516,000. Using 1 euro = 1936.27 lire and reverting the round up to the nearest thousand euro to get the original value.
