The rocket experienced a catastrophic failure 3.5 seconds into flight at an altitude of approximately [tpl]convert|10,000|ft|m[/tpl] resulting in its destruction. If successful Traveler would have been the first university/student designed and built rocket to exceed the [tpl]convert|62.14|mi|km|sing=on[/tpl] Karman Line required to claim a space flight. RPL plans to fly its second attempt, Traveler II, in May 2014.[ref]

==History==

More than ~15,000 years ago (15 tya), the Humboldt River flowed to the Smoke Creek-Black Rock Desert sub-basin, and during the recession of Lake Lahontan, the river diverted to the Carson Desert sub-basin.[tpl]cite web |last=Benson |first=L.V.; et. al |date=January 1996 |title=Carbonate deposition, Pyramid Lake subbasin, Nevada… |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/metadata/noaa-lake-5497.html |publisher=NCDC.NOAA.gov |accessdate=2010-05-19[/tpl]  During the highest Lahontan water level (~12.7 tya), the lakebed was under about [tpl]convert|500|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] of water,[ref]

Great Basin tribes inhabited the area 7.0 tya, and a Frémont Expedition encountered the site in 1843, but the Fortieth Parallel Survey (1867) conducted the first official exploration.[tpl]cite journal |last=Earl |first=Phillip I |date=Winter–Spring 1988 |title=Hollywood Comes to the Black Rock: The Story of the Making of The Winning of Barbara Worth |url=http://www.silentsaregolden.com/articles/BarbaraWorthmakingof.html |magazine=Humboldt Historian |accessdate=2010-05-15[/tpl] In the late 1840s, Peter Lassen led California Trail emigrants through the desert's Applegate-Lassen Cutoff, an arduous route that took them hundreds of miles away from the gold lands of California.  By 1910, Western Pacific's Feather River Route (Oakland-Salt Lake City) had been completed across the east side of the lakebed on the "general route first explored by Lieutenant E.G. Beckwith in 1854".[tpl]cite book |last=Wheeler |first=Sessions S. |month=September 2003--Fifth printing |origyear=May 1978 |title=Nevada's Black Rock desert |url=http://books.google.com/?id=gBYUBc-O4OgC&lpg=PA174 |page=174 |publisher=Caxton Press |isbn=978-0-87004-258-4 |accessdate=2010-05-13 |date=1978-05-01[/tpl]  By 1927, the desert had been used for filming The Winning of Barbara Worth (the 2003 Mythbusters pilot episode was also filmed in the area).
In World War II, [tpl]convert|973|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] of the Black Rock Desert was used for a USAAF aerial gunnery training range, and post-war, the north region of the United States Navy's Lovelock Aerial Gunnery Range was in the Black Rock Desert area[ref]
