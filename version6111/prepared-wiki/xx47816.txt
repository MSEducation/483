==Horse racing==

Exceedingly wealthy, Carnarvon was at first best known as an owner of racehorses and a reckless driver of early automobiles, suffering in 1901 a serious motoring accident near Bad Schwalbach in Germany which left him significantly disabled. In 1902, he established Highclere Stud to breed thoroughbred racehorses.[tpl]cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1994 |title=Architecture |journal=House and Garden |publisher=Condé Nast Publications, Ltd |volume=160 |issue=1-4 |page=54 |url= |doi= [/tpl] In 1905, he was appointed one of the Stewards at the new Newbury Racecourse. His family has maintained the connection ever since. His grandson, the 7th Earl, was racing manager to Queen Elizabeth II from 1969, and one of Her Majesty's closest friends.

==Egyptology==

Lord Carnarvon was an enthusiastic amateur Egyptologist, undertaking in 1907 to sponsor the excavation of nobles' tombs in Deir el-Bahri (Thebes). Howard Carter joined him as his assistant in the excavations.[tpl]cite book|first=H. V. F.|last=Winstone|title=Howard Carter and the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun|location=Manchester|publisher=Barzan|edition=rev.|year=2006|isbn=1-905521-04-9[/tpl] It is now established that it was Gaston Maspero, then Director of the Antiquities Department, who proposed Carter to Lord Carnarvon.A letter of Maspero dated 14 October 1907, contained in his archives in the library of the Institut de France says: You have been kind enough to say to me that you could find a man who knows Egyptology to survey my works. Have you thought to anybody? I will leave the question of payment in your hands but I think I would prefer a compatriot (Manuscripts 4009, folios 292-293). On 16 January 1909, Carter writes to Maspero: Just a word to tell you that Lord Carnarvon has accepted my conditions. He will be there (in Egypt) from 12 February to 20 March. I have to thank you again... (Manuscripts 4009, folio 527) - from Elisabeth David. He received in 1914 the concession to dig in the Valley of the Kings, in replacement of Theodore Davis who had resigned. In 1922, he and Howard Carter together opened the tomb of Tutankhamun in the Valley of the Kings, exposing treasures unsurpassed in the history of archaeology.

==Family==

Lord Carnarvon married Almina Victoria Maria Alexandra Wombwell,Barnard Burke, 1914, p.387 illegitimate daughter of millionaire banker Alfred de Rothschild,[tpl]cite news|last=Seymour|first=Miranda|title=Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey by Fiona Carnarvon – review|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/15/lady-almina-downton-carnarvon-review|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 September 2011[/tpl] at St. Margaret's Church, Westminster, on 26 June 1895.

Some of Carnarvon's modern relatives (George Herbert, 8th Earl of Carnarvon and his family), who still live in England, owns Highclere Castle, which is the film location of the famous television series, Downton Abbey.

==Death==

On 25 March 1923 Carnarvon suffered a severe mosquito bite infected by a razor cut. On 5 April, he died in the Continental-Savoy Hotel in Cairo.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Carnarvon Is Dead Of An Insect's Bite At Pharaoh's Tomb.

His death is most probably explained by blood poisoning (progressing to pneumonia) after accidentally shaving a mosquito bite infected with erysipelas.  Carnarvon's tomb, appropriately for an archaeologist, is located within an ancient hill fort overlooking his family seat at Beacon Hill, Burghclere, Hampshire.Carnarvon's Tomb Carnarvon was survived by his wife Almina, who re-married, and their two children.
