[[David Attenborough's Life Stories]]

CATEGORIES: BBC Radio 4 programmes, 2009 radio programme debuts

David Attenborough's Life Stories is a series of monologues written and spoken by British broadcaster David Attenborough on the subject of natural history. They were broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2009 as part of the station's "Point of View" strand, in the weekly timeslot formerly occupied by Alistair Cooke's Letter from America. In each of the 20 programmes, Attenborough discusses a particular subject of personal resonance, drawing on his experience of six decades filming the natural world. The series was produced by Julian Hector, head of radio at the BBC Natural History Unit.
A second 20-part series of Life Stories called New Life Stories began on 18 February 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/radio/2011/wk7/fri.shtml#fri_life|title=Network Radio Programme Information: BBC Week 7|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=5 February 2011[/tpl]

==Reception==

The series drew widespread praise from the British press. Gillian Reynolds, radio critic for The Daily Telegraph, wrote "his opening talk, about his affinity with the gently ruminant three-toed sloth, was pure delight". She went on to describe Attenborough as a "gent, scholar, a brilliant communicator with a sense of humour", and added that "unlike many a radio broadcaster these days, he doesn’t drop his voice on the key word in any sentence."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/gillianreynolds/5478350/Radio-Review-If-the-BBC-had-elections-I-bet-Attenborough-would-win.html|title=Radio Review: 'If the BBC had elections, I bet Attenborough would win'|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|author=Reynolds, Gillian|date=8 June 2009 | location=London[/tpl] The Observer's Kate Kellaway, comparing the "Sloth" episode to Attenborough's television work, wrote "if the marvellous first programme is anything to go by, it will prove that we do not need to be on televisual safari to be completely intrigued."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/jun/07/david-attenborough-electric-ink-radio-review|title=In praise of a world turned upside down|publisher=The Observer|author=Kellaway, Kate|date=7 June 2009 | location=London[/tpl] Writing in The Times on Attenborough's delivery, Simon Barnes remarked that "all the time the lilting, dancing voice is alight with wonder and — let’s call a spade a spade — love.".
In May 2010, Attenborough won Speech Broadcaster of the Year at the Sony Radio Academy Awards for his work on Life Stories.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10106403.stm|title=6 Music and Asian Network win Sony radio awards|publisher=BBC News |date=11 May 2010[/tpl]

==Book and audio book==

The complete series was released in audio book form and the scripts compiled in a hardback volume. Attenborough went on a national book signing tour to promote the titles, and also appeared on the BBC One chatshow Friday Night with Jonathan Ross to talk about the book. This book contains the same text that was used in Attenborough's speeches, along with pictures at the end of each chapter, accompanied by captions written by Attenborough.
