==History==

During the occupation of New Mexico by the United States Military starting in 1846, a military governor was appointed to oversee the area; military governors at times were assisted by civilian governors. In 1850, New Mexico was organized as a Territory and the Governor was appointed by the President of the United States. The office of Governor of the State of New Mexico was created in 1912 when New Mexico was officially admitted to the United States as the 47th state.
