The Salmon River flows from the Central Oregon Coast Range to the Pacific Ocean coast of northwest Oregon in the United States. About [tpl]convert|24|mi|km[/tpl] long, it begins and ends in Lincoln County but also flows briefly through western Polk and southern Tillamook counties.[tpl]cite map  |publisher = DeLorme Mapping  |title = Oregon Atlas and Gazetteer  |edition = 2008  |section =52, 58 |isbn = 978-0-89933-347-2[/tpl]
Rising in the mountains near the Lincolnâ€“Polk county line, it flows east into Polk County, then north and west, re-entering Lincoln County, entering Tillamook County and re-entering Lincoln County near Oregon Route 18. It continues generally west-southwestward through the Siuslaw National Forest, turning west again to enter the Pacific near Cascade Head, about [tpl]convert|4|mi|km|0[/tpl] north of Lincoln City.
Following the river through the mountains, Route 18 connects to Sheridan, McMinnville and the South Yamhill River valley to the east and U.S. Route 101 to the west. The river and highway pass through the Van Duzer Forest Corridor State Wayside. The river supports populations of wild steelhead and coastal cutthroat trout, as well as chinook and coho salmon released each year from a hatchery at Otis.
