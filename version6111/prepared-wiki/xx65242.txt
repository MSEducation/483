Goalkeeper is a Dutch close-in weapon system (CIWS) introduced in 1979 and in use [tpl]As of|2014|lc=on[/tpl]. It is an autonomous and completely automatic weapon system for short-range defense of ships against highly maneuverable missiles, aircraft and fast
maneuvering surface vessels. Once activated the system automatically performs the entire process from surveillance and detection to destruction, including selection of the next priority target.

==Development==

Development of the system began in 1975 with Holland-Signaal (now Thales Nederland) working with General Dynamics, which supplied the GAU-8 gun. A prototype, the EX-83 was first demonstrated to the Royal Netherlands Navy in 1979.
In 2012 the Dutch ministry of defense announced that the Goalkeeper systems in use by the Netherlands Navy will receive radar upgrades, mechanical improvements, new high-precision frangible ammunition and a new electro-optical tracking system. Also the system's surface mode will be improved to counter high speed boats and fast attack craft. These upgrades will make the system more capable to defend ships against the latest threats such as modern anti-ship missiles, more effective in littoral environments and less vulnerable to malfunctions. It also expands the life of the system to at least 2025. The first of 16 systems will be upgraded and tested by Thales Nederland, the others at the naval base in Den Helder.http://www.thalesgroup.com/Press_Releases/Countries/Netherlands/2012/Goalkeeper_update_program_for_Netherlands/ article from Thales Nederland

==Description==

===Target selection===

Goalkeeper has two radar sub-systems, one to find threats and another to track and engage them, which operate together to identify and prioritise targets, and engage the highest priority one.
The 2D I band search radar, which can handle up to 18 targets at once, generates a threat picture which the gun system uses to identify and prioritize threats.  The system has identify friend or foe (IFF) functionality to rule out friendly traces.Goalkeeper CIWS at the Royal Netherlands Navy LCF Frigate information page The tracking radar operates in both I band and K band to enable quick acquisition on the threat bearing.  Data from both the I band and K band return signals indicate target range and can be used to identify, and respond to the use of, electronic countermeasures (ECM).  The dual band system also reduces the effect of clutter, which can mask the target at low altitude.  A camera system on the assembly provides a visual fallback for the system operator.

===Target engagement===

The GAU-8/A Avenger 30 mm Gatling gun, as used by the A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft, was selected for the system.  The 30 mm round has a greater mass than the M61 Vulcan used in the Phalanx CIWS, so it provides much greater destructive power with similar muzzle velocity and range.
The 30 mm round has a discarding nylon sleeve (sabot) with a 21 mm sub-calibre tungsten penetrator.  The nylon sabot provides a seal between penetrator and barrel, and reduces wear. 
The tracking radar is capable of monitoring the line of fire and commanding minor adjustments.
Supersonic missiles that are damaged may still have enough momentum to hit the ship—the only way to ensure the protection of the ship is either to detonate the warhead of the missile or obliterate the missile. 
The system's reaction time to a Mach 2 sea-skimming missile such as the Russian SS-N-22 Sunburn from automatic detection to kill is reported to be 5.5 seconds with the firing synchronized to start the engagement at a range of 1,500 m and ending with a kill at 300 m.

===Operational History===

Goalkeeper’s capabilities have been proven many times during sea-going trials.  During live-fire exercises, multiple different targets including Harpoons, Exocets and target drones were shot down by Goalkeeper. During anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia the system destroyed several pirate boats and skiffs that had been seized by the Netherlands Navy.http://www.marineschepen.nl/nieuws/Tromp_ontwapent_piraten.html
