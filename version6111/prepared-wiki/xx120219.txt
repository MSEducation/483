==Name==

Birtavarre is a former mining town with smelters in Ankerlia that are preserved by the Nord-Troms Museum.  It was during the mining period that the village adopted the name Birtavarre.  Up until that time the area had been called Kåfjordbotn, meaning the end of the Kåfjorden.  Since there was also mining in Kåfjord in the nearby municipality of Alta, many workers ended up in the wrong Kåfjord.  The name was changed simply for the practical reason of avoiding confusion. The Sámi name for the place, Gáivuonbahta, is translated from the old name Kåfjordbotn. The present name for the village comes from the nearby mountain Pirttivaara which is a Kven language name.
