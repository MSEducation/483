Hind wing uniform, but bearing a postdiscal row of from three to six black, white-centered, orange-ringed eyespot. Underside very pale greyish white; fore wing: disc orange, outwardly defined by a dark line, two lines across the discoidal cell, and a sinuous discal oblique line beyond its apex not extending to the tornus, orange-brown ; subterminal and terminal dark lines; a subapical eyespot, as on the upperside, but with the outer ring paler, and a much smaller ocellus beyond it towards apex of wing. Hind wing has the basal half crossed by two sinuous curved slender lines, a shorter line crossing the cell only, and another short line defining the discocellular veins, orange-brown; the curved row of ocelli as on the upperside, but each ocellus with rings of pale ochraceous and of brown, alternately two of each; lastly, a sub-terminal and a terminal brown line. Antennae brown; head and thorax studded with long dark grey pubescence; abdomen pale brown. Sex-mark present.
