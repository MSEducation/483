[[Brindas]]

CATEGORIES: Communes of Rhône (department)

Brindas is a commune of the Rhône department in eastern France, about 15km South-West of Lyon, but not included in the Urban Community of Lyon.
Brindas is often regarded as the second home of Guignol, a French puppet show from Lyon.  The name of the village was often quoted in parts of Guignol plays as several Guignol entertainers used to spend holiday time in this village.  Pierre Neichthauser, mayor of Brindas from 1929 until 1940, was also the puppeteer for the character Gnafron in his Guignol Mourguet theatre.
A Guignol museum-theater ("Musée-théâtre Guignol") was opened in Brindas in 2008 (year of Guignol's bicentenary).
