Brunswick Dock is a dock, on the River Mersey and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the southern dock system, connected to Coburg Dock to the north, Toxteth Dock to the south. The dock was opened in 1832, designed by Jesse Hartley, specifically as a timber dock. It consisted of two lock entrances from the river.
In 1854, Cato, Miller & Company built ships at Brunswick Dock.
The Royal Navy Headquarters (RNHQ) Merseyside is on Brunswick Dock, which includes the HMS Eaglet establishment of the Royal Naval Reserve.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/royal-naval-reserve/training-centres/hms-eaglet-liverpool/unit-information/ |title=HMS Eaglet (Liverpool)|publisher=Royal Navy|accessdate=5 July 2009[/tpl] As of 2011, the Archer class patrol vessels HMS Biter  and HMS Charger are based in the dock. Due to tidal restrictions at Brunswick however, the two ships spend most of their time at Langton Dock in the North dock system in order to enable them to carry out their University Royal Naval Unit training programs more effectively. 
This and the other docks in the southern system are owned by British Waterways, with part of the dock is set aside for moorings.
