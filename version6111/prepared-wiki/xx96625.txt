James Campbell, Esq. (1826–1900) was the founder of the Estate of James Campbell, one of the largest and wealthiest landowners in the United States Territory of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i and in the state of Hawaii until 2007. It then became the James Campbell Company.

==Early years==

James Campbell was born on February 4, 1826 to Scotch-Irish William Campbell (1788–1879) and Martha Adams (1794–1871) in Londonderry, Ireland. Campbell was the eighth child of twelve children.  At the age of thirteen, Campbell boarded a ship leaving Ireland for Canada. He then went to work for his brother John in New York City.  For two years in the United States, Campbell followed in his father's footsteps as a carpenter.  In 1841 he joined a whaling crew bound for the South Pacific where the vessel was shipwrecked in the Tuamotus.  Campbell and only two shipmates survived by clinging onto debris and floating to a nearby island.  They were captured by natives and held prisoner. He convinced the chief he could be useful by using his skill at improvised repairs and their lives were spared. After a few months he escaped on a ship bound for Tahiti where he settled and lived for several years.

==Lahaina, Maui==

In 1850, the young Irishman boarded another whaling ship which later arrived at the port of Lahaina on the Hawaiian island of Maui.  Campbell once again took up carpentry to make a living.  In Lahaina he married Hannah Barla, who died in 1858.[tpl]cite web |title=James Campbell, Esq. |publisher=James Campbell Company LLC |year=2003 |url=http://www.kapolei.com/pdf/jcbookletPDFoptimized.pdf |accessdate=2010-03-23 [/tpl]
In 1860, Campbell formed a partnership with entrepreneurs Henry Turton and James Dunbar.  They established a sugar processing plant, Pioneer Mill Company. Dunbar sold out of the business early on. The partners also bought the Lahaina Sugar Company when it went bankrupt in 1863. With the thriving sugar industry in the Kingdom of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, Campbell became one of the wealthiest people in Lahaina.  He used his profits to purchase land on the islands of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu, Maui and the Big Island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i.  In 1877, Campbell sold his interest in the Pioneer Mill for half a million dollars to Turton.

==Family life==

On October 30, 1877, Campbell married 19-year old Abigail Kuaihelani Maipinepine (1859–1908).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ulukau.org/gsdl2.7/cgi-bin/algene?a=d&d=D09-000038 |title=Marriage record, Oahu(1832–1910) |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate=2010-03-01 [/tpl]
In 1878 he bought the Honolulu house of Archibald Scott Cleghorn. Cleghorn was brother-in-law to King Kalākaua, and the heir to the throne. Victoria Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iulani was born in that house.
They had four children: Abigail Campbell Kawānanakoa, Alice Kamokila Campbell, Beatrice Campbell and Muriel Campbell. Four other children died young. The oldest, Abigail, would marry Prince David Kawānanakoa of the reigning House of Kalākaua and assume the title of Princess of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i.  Kawānanakoa had three children: Princess Abigail Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani Kawānanakoa, Prince David Kalākaua Kawānanakoa, and Princess Lydia Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani Kawānanakoa. These children would later become heirs to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i as the House of Kawānanakoa.

==Land holdings==

While raising his family, Campbell ventured into real estate with purchases of massive parcels of land.  One of his most controversial purchases was of flat, arid and barren 41,000 acres (166 km²) in the Ewa District of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu.  Other businessmen criticized Campbell for making such a wasteful, unproductive investment and called him insane.  Campbell hired in 1879 James Ashley of California to drill the first artesian water well in Hawaii to supply his purchase with fresh irrigation.  Campbell used the land for sugarcane production and profits poured into his coffers.  Campbell continued to purchase underestimated plots of real estate and transformed them into productive agricultural districts.
He was appointed to serve in the House of Nobles (upper house of the legislature) in 1887 and 1888.[tpl]cite web |url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH0122.dir/Campbell,%20James.jpg |title=Campbell, James office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate=2010-03-01 [/tpl]
He and his wife were loyal supporters of Queen Liliuokalani at the time of her overthrow in 1893.  In August 1896, while he was in San Francisco, he was kidnapped by Oliver Winthrop who pretended to be asking real estate advice. Winthrop and an unknown accomplice took $305 from him and threatened to shoot him if he did not write them a check for $20,000. After being held for two days without food or water and enduring several beatings, he still refused any ransom. The 70-year-old Campbell was released. Winthrop never testified, but was found guilty.[tpl]cite news |title=The Nerviest Man in Honolulu: Hilo-based historian Joe Theroux recounts the 1896 kidnapping of James Campbell |author=Joe Theroux  |newspaper=Honolulu Magazine |date=November 2009 |url=http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/November-2009/The-Nerviest-Man-in-Honolulu/ |accessdate=2010-03-23 [/tpl]
He died  April 21, 1900 with US$3 million to his name, left in trust to his children and their heirs.
It is on land owned by his estate that Kapolei was developed, a new suburb of Honolulu. In 2004 his 176 beneficiaries decided to form the "James Campbell Company".[tpl]cite news |title=Campbell heirs opt for private business: Estate beneficiaries will form a company to manage real estate |author=Allison Schaefers |newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date=October 6, 2004 |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/10/06/news/index4.html |accessdate=2010-01-14 [/tpl]
