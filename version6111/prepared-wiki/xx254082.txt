[[Finite element limit analysis]]

CATEGORIES: Structural analysis, Geotechnical engineering

A finite element limit analysis (FELA) uses optimisation techniques to directly compute the upper or lower bound plastic collapse load (or limit load) for a mechanical system rather than time stepping to a collapse load, as might be undertaken with conventional non-linear finite element techniques. The problem may be formulated in either a kinematic or equilibrium form.[ref]Lysmer, J. (1970). Limit analysis of plane problems in
soil mechanics. Journal of the Soil Mechanics and Foundations Division ASCE 96(4), 1311–1334.[/ref][ref]Sloan, S. (1988). Lower bound limit analysis using finite
elements and linear programming. Int. J. Num. Anal. Meth. in Geomech. 12(4), 61–77.[/ref]
The technique has been used most significantly in the field of soil mechanics for the determination of collapse loads for geotechnical problems (e.g. slope stability analysis). An alternative technique which may be used to undertake similar direct plastic collapse computations using optimization is Discontinuity layout optimization.
