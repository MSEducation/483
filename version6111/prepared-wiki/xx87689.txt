==History==

The original plan for the route of the line through Royal Park was to be east of the Zoological Gardens, but after local protests against the destruction of the park, a decision was made to build the line to the west for "reasons of economy". On opening only temporary station buildings were provided, along with a signal box and gatekeepers cottage.[tpl]cite book|author=Jon Saul and Wendy Moore|title=Down the line to Upfield|publisher=Coburg Public Transport Group|date=May 1990[/tpl]
On 8 May 1888 Royal Park became a junction station with the opening of the Inner Circle line to both Clifton Hill and Northcote. At the same time a timber station building and station masters residence were erected. Between 1889 and 1912 there was a goods siding near the station, named Royal Park Cutting Siding.
The current station building on the up platform was opened in 1920, with a tile roof in the "Gisborne style", and in 1936 a new waiting shed and ticket office replaced earlier structures on platform 2. Boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at Poplar Road in 1971 when automatic signaling reached the station from Jewell, with automatic signaling extended to Macaulay in 1972.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vrhistory.com/Locations/T1997.PDF|title=VR History by Andrew Waugh - Upfield Line|publisher=VR History|author=Andrew Waugh|accessdate=2009-02-24[/tpl] The Inner Circle line (by then a goods-only stub to Fitzroy) was closed in 1981 and the waiting shed on the down platform was destroyed by arson in 1989.
