The River Derwent is a river on the border between County Durham and Northumberland in the north east of England. It broadens into the Derwent Reservoir, west of Consett.  The Derwent is a tributary of the River Tyne, which it joins near the MetroCentre. The river flows for 35 miles from its origin, where two streams meet approximately a mile west of Blanchland, to Derwenthaugh where it flows into the River Tyne. On its journey, the river flows through places such as Allensford, Shotley Bridge, Blackhall Mill and Rowlands Gill. The river is known locally as "The Divvy"[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] . Derwent Walk Country Park named after it is at Rowlands Gill. Fishing permits on the river are usually priced at Â£3.00 on each stretch.
The name Derwent comes from the Brythonic/Early Welsh word for oak derw, harking back to the time when the Derwent Valley was inhabited by a British-speaking population.
