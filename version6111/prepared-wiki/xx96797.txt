The Parti marxiste–léniniste du Québec (PMLQ, in English: Marxist-Leninist Party of Quebec) is a communist political party in Quebec, Canada. Its ideology is Marxism-Leninism. The PMLQ is the Quebec branch of the Communist Party of Canada (Marxist–Leninist). It has run candidates in Quebec general elections in 1973, 1981 and since 1989 under various names: Parti communiste du Québec (marxiste-léniniste), Parti marxiste-léniniste (Québec) and Parti marxiste-léniniste du Québec.
