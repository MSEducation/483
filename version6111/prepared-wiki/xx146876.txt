In December that year, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) granted Tamim a one-year grade C contract, one of 22 central contracts with the Board at the time. Although he was still in the lowest tier of central contracts, it was an extension form his previous contract, which lasted six months.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/story/324038.html |title=Bangladesh board releases contracted players' list |publisher=Cricinfo |date=6 December 2007 |accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl]
On Bangladesh's tour of the West Indies in July and August 2009, Tamim scored his maiden Test century against a West Indies team weakened by disputes between players and administrators, which resulted in seven players making their Test debut in the match,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wivbdesh2009/content/story/413237.html |title=West Indies name replacement squad |publisher=Cricinfo |date=8 July 2009 |accessdate=25 July 2011[/tpl] His effort with the bat helped Bangladesh to a historic victory – their first against the West Indies in Tests, their first overseas Test victory and only their second Test win.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wivbdesh2009/content/story/414146.html |title=Shakib, Mahmudullah make up for Mortaza's absence |date=13 July 2009 |publisher=Cricinfo |accessdate=25 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/247/247186.html |title=West Indies v Bangladesh: Bangladesh in West Indies 2009 (1st Test) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=25 July 2011[/tpl] He ended up with 128, and was named as the Man of the Match for his performance (he also scored 33 in the first innings). Speaking of his innings, Tamim said "It was a flat wicket, and if you concentrate hard and look to bat straight, it's a good track to score on. I'm just 20 and have played only 11 Tests, I think there are a lot more like these to come".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wivbdesh2009/content/story/413237.html |title=West Indies name replacement squad |publisher=Cricinfo |date=8 July 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wivbdesh2009/content/story/414146.html|title=Shakib, Mahmudullah make up for Mortaza's absence|date=13 July 2009|publisher=Cricinfo |accessdate=18 July 2009[/tpl] Bangladesh went on to win the second Test, and in the process secured their first overseas series win.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wivbdesh2009/content/current/story/415358.html |title=Raqibul and Shakib inspire first overseas series win |last=Veera |first=Sriram |publisher=Cricinfo |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=25 July 2011[/tpl] Iqbal was Bangladesh's leading run-scorer in the series with 197 runs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=5037;type=series |title=Records / Bangladesh in West Indies Test Series, 2009 / Most runs |publisher=Cricinfo |accessdate=25 July 2011[/tpl]

The following game against England he scored a quick fire 38 to get his side off to another good start, Bangladesh eventually winning by two wickets.
Tamim became only the second Bangladeshi to play county cricket in England (Shakib Al Hasan was the first)[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/13793737.stm |title=Notts sign Tamim Iqbal to replace David Hussey in t20 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 June 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2011[/tpl] when he signed to play for Nottinghamshire in June 2011.
