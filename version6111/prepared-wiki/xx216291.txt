[[Seven (Enuff Z'nuff album)]]

CATEGORIES: Enuff Z'nuff albums, 1997 albums

Seven is the 7th studio album by American rock band Enuff Z'Nuff, which was originally released in Japan as ‘Brothers’ under the band name "Chip & Donnie" in 1994. Seven  was initially intended to form one half of a double-album for the Japanese market, paired with the record that would eventually become the album Tweaked. The sessions were split into two separate discs, with the pop sounding ‘Brothers’ LP getting re-branded as an Enuff Z'nuff album in 1997 for its stateside release. As well as the re-titling and new artwork, Seven contains two bonus tracks not available on the original ‘Brothers’ disc.
On Seven the band adopted a more acoustic sound compared to Tweaked, which may be seen as its heavier counterpart. Several tracks on the album are also significant to the band’s history:
"Down Hill" is thought by lead singer Donnie Vie to possibly contain late guitarist Derek Frigo’s last studio recorded solo with the band. "You And I" was played by Donnie Vie at bassist Chip Z’nuff’s wedding reception. "It’s No Good," an acoustic concert staple, was later re-recorded by and featured on Donnie Vie’s solo album Extra Strength. Other notable tracks are the lead single "Wheels," which was covered in 1998 by Arista recording artists The Tuesdays Album profile of The TuesdaysAllmusic.

Causing some confusion, Seven was later re-released under its original Japanese title, "Brothers" in the U.S. (featuring with new artwork and the Enuff Z'Nuff name) in 2008. The "Enuff Z'Nuff: Brothers" re-issue is the same as the original "Chip & Donnie" Japanese release in '94, meaning the bonus tracks from "Seven" are no longer present.z'nuff|chart=all}} Brothers album profile Billboard.
