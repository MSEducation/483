[[PMDTA]]

CATEGORIES: Polyamines

PMDTA, formally N,N,N′,N′,N′′-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine, is an organic compound with the formula Me2NCH2CH22NMe (Me is CH3). PMDTA is a basic, bulky, and flexible, tridentate ligand that is a used in organolithium chemistry.

==Synthesis==

PMDTA is prepared by methylating diethylenetriamine with formaldehyde and formic acid.[tpl]cite journal | author = Marxer, A.; Miescher, K. | title = Über die stufenweise Quaternisierung von aliphatischen Polyaminen.

==Comparison with diethylenetriamine==

Unlike diethylenetriamine, all three amines in PDMTA are tertiary. Both PMDTA and diethylenetriamine are tridentate ligands that form two five-membered chelate rings. The σ-donating properties of the amino groups of diethylenetriamine are greater than that of PMDTA in copper(II) complexes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Angelici, R. J.; Allison, J.

==Organolithium compounds and PMDTA==

Alkyllithium compounds such as n-butyllithium (BuLi) are used to deprotonate weak acids, e.g. hydrocarbons. It is well known that organolithium aggregates are broken up by Lewis bases to give reagents that EW a more efficient base than untreated BuLi.[tpl]cite journal | author = Strohmann, C.; Gessner, V.

PMDTA behaves analogously, but since it is tridentate, it binds more strongly to lithium.  In contrast to TMEDA, PMDTA forms monomeric complexes with organolithium compounds.  Both amines affect the regiochemistry of metalation.[tpl] cite encyclopedia | author = Fraenkel, G. | title =  PMDTA | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis | pages = 806–813 | year =  2002 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | doi = 10.1002/047084289X.rp028 | isbn = 0-471-93623-5 [/tpl]
In the PMDTA-n-BuLi adducts, the Li-C bonds are highly polarized, thus increasing the basicity of the butyl group.[tpl]cite book | author = Elschenbroich, C. | year = 2006 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | title = Organometallics | pages = 45–46 | isbn = 978-3-527-29390-2 [/tpl]
The effect of PMDTA on lithium anilide is illustrative of PMDTA's complexing power. The complex, {PhN(H)Li}3·2PMDTA, is trinuclear, featuring approximately colinear Li+ centers that are three-, four-, and five-coordinate. The central three-coordinate lithium atom is not bonded to PMDTA. One of the terminal Li centers is pseudo-tetrahedral in an N4 coordination sphere. The other terminal lithium atom is five-coordinate and binds to two anilino N centers and the PMDTA.[tpl]cite journal | author = Barr, D.; Clegg, W.; Cowton, L.; Horsburgh, L.; Mackenzie, F.

==Transition metal and aluminium complexes==

PMDTA often forms five-coordinate complexes due to steric bulk of the methyl groups.  PMDTA stabilize unusual cations. The first cationic derivative of alane. H2Al(PMDTA)+AlH4- was prepared by treating H3AlNMe3 with PMDTA.
