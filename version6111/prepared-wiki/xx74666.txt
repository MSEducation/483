The Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) is a bird of prey, one of three species colloquially known in the United States as the "chickenhawk," though it rarely preys on standard sized chickens.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red-tailed_Hawk/lifehistory |title=Red-tailed Hawk |work=All About Birds |publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=16 May 2011[/tpl] It breeds throughout most of North America, from western Alaska and northern Canada to as far south as Panama and the West Indies, and is one of the most common buteos in North America. Red-tailed Hawks can acclimate to all the biomes within their range. There are fourteen recognized subspecies, which vary in appearance and range. It is one of the largest members of the genus Buteo in North America, typically weighing from [tpl]Convert|690|to|1600|g|lbs|abbr = on[/tpl] and measuring [tpl]Convert|45|-|65|cm|abbr = on[/tpl] in length, with a wingspan from [tpl]Convert|110|-|145|cm|abbr = on[/tpl]. The Red-tailed Hawk displays sexual dimorphism in size, with females averaging about 25% heavier than males.[tpl]cite web |url=http://eol.org/pages/1049057/details |title=Red-tailed Hawk |work=Encyclopedia of Life |accessdate=21 March 2012[/tpl]
The Harlan's Hawk (B. j. harlani), often considered a separate species, is treated below in the Taxonomy section.
The Red-tailed Hawk occupies a wide range of habitats and altitudes, including deserts, grasslands, coniferous and deciduous forests, tropical rainforests, agricultural fields and urban areas. It lives throughout the North American continent, except in areas of unbroken forest or the high arctic. It is legally protected in Canada, Mexico and the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
Because they are so common and easily trained as capable hunters, the majority of hawks captured for falconry in the United States are Red-tails. Falconers are permitted to take only passage hawks (which have left the nest, are on their own, but are less than a year old) so as to not affect the breeding population. Adults, which may be breeding or rearing chicks, may not be taken for falconry purposes and it is illegal to do so. Passage red-tailed hawks are also preferred by falconers because these younger birds have not yet developed adult behaviors, which will make training substantially more challenging.

Red-tailed Hawk plumage can be variable, depending on the subspecies and the region. These color variations are morphs, and are not related to molting. The western North American population, B. j. calurus, is the most variable subspecies and has three color morphs: light, dark, and intermediate or rufus. The dark and intermediate morphs constitute 10–20% of the population.
Though the markings and hue vary across the subspecies, the basic appearance of the Red-tailed Hawk is consistent. Overall, this species is blocky and broad in shape, often appearing (and being) heavier than other Buteos of similar length. A whitish underbelly with a dark brown band across the belly, formed by horizontal streaks in feather patterning, is present in most color variations. Especially in younger birds, the underside may be otherwise covered with dark brown spotting. The red tail, which gives this species its name, is uniformly brick-red above and light buff-orange below. The bill is short and dark, in the hooked shape characteristic of raptors, and the head can sometimes appear small in size against the thick body frame. They have a relatively short, broad tails and thick, chunky wings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/Infocenter/i3370id.html|title=Buteo jamaicensis |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=5 June 2007[/tpl] The cere, the legs, and the feet of the Red-tailed Hawk are all yellow.[tpl]cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Buteo_jamaicensis.html|last=Dewey|first= T. |first2= D. |last2=Arnold|title=Buteo jamaicensis|accessdate=5 June 2007[/tpl]
Immature birds can be readily identified at close range by their yellowish irises. As the bird attains full maturity over the course of 3–4 years, the iris slowly darkens into a reddish-brown hue. In both the light and dark morphs, the tail of the immature Red-tailed Hawk are patterned with numerous darker bars.

==Taxonomy==

The Red-Tailed Hawk is a member of the genus Buteo, a group of medium-sized raptors with robust bodies and broad wings. Members of this genus are known as buzzards in Europe, but hawks in North America.[tpl]ITIS |id=175350 |taxon=Buteo jamaicensis (J. F. Gmelin, 1788) |accessdate=16 May 2011[/tpl]
There are at least 14 recognized subspecies of Buteo jamaicensis, which vary in range and in coloration:
The four island forms, jamaicensis, solitudinus, socorroensis, and fumosus, do not overlap in range with any other subspecies.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Red-tailed Hawk is one of the most widely distributed hawks in the Americas. It breeds from central Alaska, the Yukon, and the Northwest Territories east to southern Quebec and the Maritime Provinces of Canada, and south to Florida, the West Indies, and Central America. The winter range stretches from southern Canada south throughout the remainder of the breeding range.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/animals/bird/buja/all.html#DISTRIBUTION%20AND%20OCCURRENCE|title=Buteo jamaicensis|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |last=Tesky|first= Julie L.|accessdate=10 June 2007[/tpl]
Its preferred habitat is mixed forest and field, with high bluffs or trees that may be used as perch sites. It occupies a wide range of habitats and altitudes, including deserts, grasslands, coastal regions, mountains, foothills, coniferous and deciduous woodlands, tropical rainforests, agricultural fields and urban areas. It is second only to the Peregrine Falcon in the use of diverse habitats in North America.[tpl]cite web | last =Garrigues | first =Jeff | title =Biogeography of Red-tailed hawk | publisher =San Francisco State University Department of Geography | accessdate=28 June 2007 | url =http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/Fall00Projects/redtailedhawk.html [/tpl] It lives throughout the North American continent, except in areas of unbroken forest or the high Arctic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/id/special_areas/birds_of_prey_nca.Par.63269.File.dat/RedTailedHawk_r.pdf|title=Red-tailed Hawk|publisher=Bureau of Land Management|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl]
The Red-tailed Hawk is widespread in North America, partially due to historic settlement patterns, which have benefited it. The clearing of forests in the Northeast created hunting areas, while the preservation of woodlots left the species with viable nest sites. The planting of trees in the west allowed the Red-tailed Hawk to expand its range by creating nest sites where there had been none. The construction of highways with utility poles alongside treeless medians provided perfect habitat for perch-hunting. Unlike some other raptors, the Red-tailed Hawk are seemingly unfazed by considerable human activity and can nest and live in close proximity to large numbers of humans. Thus, the species can also be found in cities, where common prey such as rock pigeons and brown rats may support their populations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080517111759/http://www.sky-hunters.org/RTHA.pdf|title=Red-tailed Hawk|publisher=Sky-hunters.org|accessdate=16 June 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] One urban Red-tailed Hawk, known as "Pale Male", became famous for being the first Red-tail in decades to successfully nest and raise young in the crowded New York City borough of Manhattan.Pale Male – Introduction – Red-tailed Hawk in New York City | Nature.

==Behavior==

===Flight===

In flight, this hawk soars with wings often in a slight dihedral, flapping as little as possible to conserve energy. Active flight is slow and deliberate, with deep wing beats. In wind, it occasionally hovers on beating wings and remains stationary above the ground. When soaring or flapping its wings, it typically travels from 32 to [tpl]convert|64|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on[/tpl], but when diving may exceed [tpl]convert|190|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nysite.com/nature/fauna/redhawk.htm|author=Day, Leslie|publisher=79th Street Boat Basin Flora and Fauna Society|title=The City Naturalist – Red Tailed Hawk|accessdate=17 June 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Vocalization===

The cry of the Red-tailed Hawk is a two to three second hoarse, rasping scream, described as kree-eee-ar, which begins at a high pitch and slurs downward. This cry is often described as sounding similar to a steam whistle. The Red-tailed Hawk frequently vocalizes while hunting or soaring, but vocalizes loudest in annoyance or anger, in response to a predator or a rival hawk's intrusion into its territory. At close range, it makes a croaking "guh-runk".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oregonzoo.org/Cards/BirdsOfPrey/redtailedhawk.htm|publisher=Oregon Zoo|title=Red-Tailed Hawk|accessdate=16 June 2007[/tpl] Young hawks may utter a wailing klee-uk food cry when parents leave the nest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hawk-conservancy.org/priors/redtail.shtml|publisher=The Hawk Conservancy Trust|title=Red-tailed Hawk – Buteo jamaicensis|accessdate=5 June 2007[/tpl] The fierce, screaming cry of the Red-tailed Hawk is frequently used as a generic raptor sound effect in television shows and other media, even if the bird featured is not a Red-tailed Hawk.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-red_tailed_hawk.html|publisher=San Diego Zoo|title=San Diego Zoo's Animal Bytes: Red-Tailed Hawk|accessdate=3 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20131228034412/http://www.salon.com/2013/12/28/raptor_porn_the_ridiculous_proliferation_of_the_red_tail_call/|publisher=Salon.com|title=Raptor porn: The ridiculous proliferation of the red-tail call|accessdate=27 December 2013[/tpl]

===Diet===

The Red-tailed Hawk is carnivorous, and an opportunistic feeder. Its diet is mainly small mammals, but it also includes birds and reptiles. Prey varies with regional and seasonal availability, but usually centers on rodents, comprising up to 85% of a hawk's diet. Most commonly reported prey types include mice, including both native Peromyscus species and house mice, gophers, voles, chipmunks, ground squirrels and tree squirrels.[tpl]cite journal |first=Mark Andrew|last= Springer |first2= John Stephen |last2=Kirkley |year=1978 |title=Inter and Intraspecific interactions between Red-Tailed Hawks and Great Horned Owls in Central Ohio |journal=The Ohio Journal of Science |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages=323–328 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1811/22576[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |first=Carl D. |last=Marti |first2= Michael N.|last2= Kochert |year=1995 |title=Are Red-tailed Hawks and Great Horned Owls diurnal–nocturnal dietary counterparts? |journal=Wilson Bulletin |volume=107 |issue=4 |pages=615–628 |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v107n04/p0615-p0628.pdf |format=PDF |jstor=4163598[/tpl] Additional prey (listed by descending likelihood of predation) include lagomorphs, shrews, bats, pigeons, quail, corvids, waterfowl, other raptors, reptiles, fish, crustaceans, insects and earthworms. Where found in Caribbean islands, Red-tailed Hawks prey mostly on reptiles such as snakes and lizards, since these are perhaps the most predominant native land animals of that region. Prey specimens can range to as small a size as beetles and worms. However, they can also prey on marmots, White-tailed Jackrabbits, small domestic dogs, domestic cats, or female Wild Turkey, all of which are easily double the weight of most Red-tails. Although they prefer to feed on fresh prey they've killed themselves, these hawks are not above occasionally consuming carrion. During winter in captivity, an average Red-tail will eat about [tpl]Convert|135|g|abbr = on[/tpl] daily.
The Red-tailed Hawk commonly employ one of two hunting technique. Often, they scan for prey activity from an elevated perch site, swooping down from the perch to seize the prey. They also watch for prey while flying, either capturing a bird in flight or pursuing prey on the ground until they can pin them down in their talons. Red-tailed Hawks, like some other raptors, have been observed to hunt in pairs. This may consist of stalking opposites sides of a tree, in order to surround a tree squirrel and almost inevitably drive the rodent to be captured by one after being flushed by the other hawk.Red-tailed Hawk, Life History, All About Birds – Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Allaboutbirds.org. Retrieved on 2012-08-22. They are opportunistically attracted to conspicuous meals, such as displaying male Red-winged Blackbirds.
The Great Horned Owl occupies a similar ecological niche nocturnally to the Red-tail, taking similar prey. Competition may occur between the Red-tailed Hawk and the Great Horned Owl during twilight, although the differing nesting season and activity times usually results in a lack of direct competition. Although the Red-tailed's prey is on average larger (due in part to the scarcity of diurnal squirrels in the Owl's diet), the Great Horned Owl is an occasional predator of Red-tailed Hawks of any age, while the hawks are not known to predate adult Horned Owls. Other competitors include other large Buteos such as Swainson's Hawks and Rough-legged Hawks as well as the Northern Goshawk, since prey and foraging methods of these species occasionally overlap.[tpl]cite web |url=http://digital-desert.com/wildlife/red-tailed-hawk.html |title=Red-tailed Hawk |work=Desert Wildlife |publisher=Digital-Desert |author=Walter Feller |accessdate=16 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |first=Angela E. |last=Gatto|first2=Teryl G. |last2=Grubb |first3=Carol L.|last3= Chambers |year=2006 |title=Red-tailed Hawk dietary overlap with Northern Goshawks on the Kaibab Plateau, Arizona |journal=Journal of Raptor Research |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=439–444 |url=http://www.rmrs.nau.edu/publications/GattoEtal/GattoEtal.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl]

===Reproduction===

The Red-tailed Hawk reaches sexual maturity at two years of age. It is monogamous, mating with the same individual for many years. In general, the Red-tailed Hawk will only take a new mate when its original mate dies.[tpl]cite book | last =Terres | first =John K. | authorlink =John Kenneth Terres | title =The Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds | publisher =Knopf | year =1980 | location =New York | page =1109 | isbn =0-394-46651-9 [/tpl] The same nesting territory may be defended by the pair for years. During courtship, the male and female fly in wide circles while uttering shrill cries. The male performs aerial displays, diving steeply, and then climbing again. After repeating this display several times, he sometimes grasps her talons briefly with his own. Courtship flights can last 10 minutes or more. Copulation often follows courtship flight sequences, although copulation frequently occurs in the absence of courtship flights.
In copulation, the female, when perched, tilts forward, allowing the male to land with his feet lodged on her horizontal back. The female twists and moves her tail feathers to one side, while the mounted male twists his cloacal opening around the female's cloaca. Copulation lasts 5 to 10 seconds and during pre-nesting courtship in late winter or early spring can occur numerous times each day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oiseaux.net/oiseaux/accipitriformes/red-tailed.hawk.html|title=Buteo jamaicensis |publisher=Oiseaux.net |accessdate=7 June 2007[/tpl]
In the same period, the pair constructs a stick nest in a large tree [tpl]convert|4|to|21|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] off the ground or on a cliff ledge [tpl]Convert|35|m|ft|abbr = on[/tpl] or higher above the ground, or may nest on man-made structures. The nest is generally [tpl]Convert|71|to|97|cm|abbr = on[/tpl] in diameter and can be up to [tpl]Convert|90|cm|ft|abbr = on[/tpl] tall. The nest is constructed of twigs, and lined with bark, pine needles, corn cobs, husks, stalks, aspen catkins, or other plant lining matter.
Great Horned Owls compete with the Red-tailed Hawk for nest sites. Each species has been known to kill the young and destroy the eggs of the other, but in general, both species nest in adjacent or confluent territories without conflict. Great Horned Owls are incapable of constructing nests and typically expropriate existing Red-tail nests. Great Horned Owls begin nesting behaviors much earlier than Red-tails, often as early as December. Red-tails are therefore adapted to constructing new nests when a previous year's nest has been overtaken by owls or otherwise lost. New nests are typically within a kilometer or less of the previous nest. Often, a new nest is only a few hundred meters or less from a previous one. Being a large predator, most predation of these hawks occurs with eggs and nestlings, which are taken by owls, corvids and raccoons.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/red-tailed_hawk.htm |title=Red-tailed Hawk, Buteo jamaicensis |work=Study of Northern Virginia Ecology |publisher=Fairfax County Public Schools |accessdate=16 May 2011[/tpl]
A clutch of 1 to 3 eggs is laid in March or April, depending upon latitude. Clutch size depends almost exclusively on the availability of prey for the adults. Eggs are laid approximately every other day. The eggs are usually about [tpl]Convert|60|x|47|mm|abbr = on[/tpl]. They are incubated primarily by female, with the male substituting when the female leaves to hunt or merely stretch her wings. The male brings most food to the female while she incubates. After 28 to 35 days, the eggs hatch over 2 to 4 days; the nestlings are altricial at hatching. The female broods them while the male provides most of the food to the female and the young, which are known as eyasses (pronounced "EYE-ess-ez"). The female feeds the eyasses after tearing the food into small pieces. After 42 to 46 days, the eyasses begin to leave the nest. The fledging period follows, with short flights engaged in, after another 3 weeks. About 6 to 7 weeks after fledging, the young begin to capture their own prey. Shortly thereafter, when the young are around 4 months of age, they become independent of their parents. However, the hawks do not generally reach breeding maturity until they are around 3 years of age. In the wild, Red-tailed Hawks have lived for at least 21 years, for example, Pale Male was born in 1990, and in Spring 2014 is still raising eyasses. The oldest captive hawk of this species was at least 29 and a half years of age.

==Relationship with humans==

The non-fiction book Red-Tails in Love: A Wildlife Drama in Central Park by Marie Winn is about Pale Male, a famous urban Red-tailed Hawk in New York.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/07/10/sunday/main562715.shtml|publisher=CBS|last=Geist|first=Bill|title=In Love With A Hawk|accessdate=17 June 2007 | date=10 July 2003[/tpl]

===Use in falconry===

The Red-tailed Hawk is a popular bird in falconry, particularly in the United States where the sport of falconry is tightly regulated at the federal and state levels. There are fewer than 5,000 falconers in the United States, therefore any effect on the Red-tailed Hawk population, estimated to be about one million in the United States, is statistically insignificant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/05-2378.html|publisher=Department of the Interior: Fish and Wildlife Service|title=Migratory Bird Permits; Changes in the Regulations Governing Falconry; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment for Falconry and Raptor Propagation Activities; Proposed Rule and Notice|accessdate=14 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070311204705/http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/05-2378.html |archivedate = 11 March 2007[/tpl]
In the course of a hunt, a falconer using a Red-tailed Hawk most commonly releases the hawk and allows it to perch in a tree or other high vantage point. The falconer, who may be aided by a dog, then attempts to flush prey by stirring up ground cover. A well-trained Red-tailed Hawk will follow the falconer and dog, realizing that their activities produce opportunities to catch game. Once a raptor catches game, it does not bring it back to the falconer. Instead, the falconer must locate the bird and its captured prey, "make in", (carefully approach) and trade the bird its kill in exchange for a piece of offered meat.[tpl]cite book| last =McGranaghan| first =Liam J.| title =The Red-Tailed Hawk: A Complete Guide to Training and Hunting North America's Most Versatile Game Hawk.| publisher =Western Sporting Publications| year =2001| page =181| isbn =0-9709571-0-6[/tpl]

===Feathers and Native American use===

The feathers and other parts of the Red-tailed Hawk are considered sacred to many American indigenous people and, like the feathers of the Bald Eagle and Golden Eagle, are sometimes used in religious ceremonies and found adorning the regalia of many Native Americans in the United States; these parts, most especially their distinctive tail feathers, are a popular item in the Native American community.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pequotmuseum.org/Home/CrossPaths/CrossPathsSpring2003/TheSacredMessengers.htm|last=Collier|first= Julie|title=The Sacred Messengers|publisher=Mashantucket Pequot Museum|accessdate=20 June 2007[/tpl]
As with the other two species, the feathers and parts of the Red-tailed Hawk are regulated by the eagle feather law, which governs the possession of feathers and parts of migratory birds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pequotmuseum.org/Home/CrossPaths/CrossPathsSpring2003/FeatherLaw.htm|last=Cook|first=Stephen|title=Feather Law|publisher=Mashantucket Pequot Museum|accessdate=20 June 2007[/tpl]
