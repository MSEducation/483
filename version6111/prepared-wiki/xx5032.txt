The Jutland Peninsula ([tpl]lang-da|Den Jyske Halvø[/tpl] [tpl]lang-de|Jütische Halbinsel[/tpl]) or more historically the Cimbrian Peninsula ([tpl]lang-da|Den Kimbriske Halvø[/tpl] [tpl]lang-de|Kimbrische Halbinsel[/tpl]) is a peninsula in Europe, divided between Denmark and Germany. The names are derived from the Jutes and the Cimbri.
The historic region of Jutland, the area that was covered by Codex Holmiensis (Jyske Lov) covered the Jutland Peninsula area north of Eider River and included Funen, the North Jutlandic Island and other smaller islands.  Much of the varying definitions of what Jutland consists of are due to differences between the Jutland peninsula considered as a geographic feature and Jutland considered as a historical political territory.
Its terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east.

==Subregions==

Northern Schleswig and Southern Schleswig form the historic region Southern Jutland (Sønderjylland). The Duchy of Schleswig covered almost the same area.

==Geography==

Its terrain is relatively flat, with heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated, fertile and slightly hilly terrain in the east. The Danish portion has an area of [tpl]convert|29,775|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] and a population of 2,513,601 (2007). Population density is 84 per km² (218 per sq.mi.). 
The northernmost part of Jutland is separated by the Limfjord from the mainland, but is still commonly reckoned as part of the peninsula. It only became an island following a flood in 1825. The area is called the North Jutlandic Island, Vendsyssel-Thy (after its districts) or simply Jutland north of the Limfjord; it is only partly coterminous with the region called North Jutland.
The islands Læsø, Anholt and Samsø in Kattegat and Als at the rim of the Baltic Sea South are administratively and historically tied to Jutland, although especially the latter two are also regarded traditional districts of their own. Inhabitants of Als would agree to be South Jutlanders, but not necessarily Jutlanders.
The Danish Wadden Sea Islands and the German North Frisian Islands stretch along the southwest coast of Jutland in the German Bight.

==German part==

The southern third of the Jutland peninsula is made up of the German Bundesland of Schleswig-Holstein. Schleswig-Holstein comprises two parts, the former duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, both of which have passed back and forth between Danish and German rulers several times. The last adjustment of the Danish–German border followed the Schleswig Plebiscites in 1920 and resulted in Denmark's regaining Northern Schleswig ([tpl]lang-da|Nordslesvig[/tpl] or more commonly today: Sønderjylland). 
The historical southern border of Jutland is the river Eider, which is also the border between the former duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, as well as the historical border between the Danish and German realms from c. 800 to 1864. Although most of Schleswig-Holstein is geographically part of the Jutland peninsula, most German residents there would not identify themselves with Jutland or even as "Jutlanders", but rather with North Germany ([tpl]lang-de|Norddeutschland[/tpl]) and consider themselves Northern Germans ([tpl]lang-de|Norddeutsche[/tpl]). 
The medieval Code of Jutland applied for Schleswig until 1900 when it was replaced by the Prussian Civil Code. Some rarely used clauses of the Jutlandic Code still apply north of the Eider today, but not south of the Eider.

===Cities===

The largest cities in the German part of Jutland or the Jutland Peninsula are Kiel, Lübeck, Flensburg, and Neumünster.
