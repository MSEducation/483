==History==

The earliest flag of the Maldives consisted of a plain red field. Later, a black and white striped hoist called the Dhandimathi (Dhivehi: ދަނޑިމަތި) was added to the flag.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.maldivesroyalfamily.com/maldive_flags_romero_frias.shtml |title=Sultanate of the Maldives (-1949)|accessdate=2004-07-05 |author=Maldives Royal Family |coauthors=[/tpl] 
This version of the flag was used until early in the 20th century, when Abdul Majeed Didi added a crescent to the national flag. At the same time, a distinct state flag was made, which had the crescent on a green rectangle. These changes were made some time between 1926 and 1932, during Abdul Majeed's term as Prime Minister."http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Maldives.htm"
In 1953, the Maldives became a republic, resulting in another flag change. The national flag was dropped and the crescent on the state flag was reversed, so that it faced the hoist. The Sultanate was restored in 1954, but the flag was not changed back.[tpl]FOTW|id=mv_prot|title=Maldives: From protectorate to independence (1949-1968)[/tpl] Instead, Muhammad Fareed Didi created a new flag specifically for the Sultan, with a five-pointed star next to the crescent. A version of this flag is still used today as the Presidential Standard.
When the Maldives gained independence in 1965, the black and white hoist was removed, giving the flag its modern form.
