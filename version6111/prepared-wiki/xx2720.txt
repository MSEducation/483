Enzymes [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|z|aɪ|m|z[/tpl] are large biological molecules responsible for the thousands of metabolic processes that sustain life.[tpl]cite book |author=Smith AL (Ed) |title=Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford Oxfordshire |year=1997 |isbn=0-19-854768-4 |author-separator=, |display-authors=1[/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Grisham, Charles M.; Reginald H. Garrett |title=Biochemistry |publisher=Saunders College Pub |location=Philadelphia |year=1999 |pages=426–7 |isbn=0-03-022318-0[/tpl] They are highly selective catalysts, greatly accelerating both the rate and specificity of metabolic reactions, from the digestion of food to the synthesis of DNA. Most enzymes are proteins, although some catalytic RNA molecules have been identified. Enzymes adopt a specific three-dimensional structure, and may employ organic (e.g. biotin) and inorganic (e.g. magnesium ion) cofactors to assist in catalysis.
In enzymatic reactions, the molecules at the beginning of the process, called substrates, are converted into different molecules, called products. Almost all chemical reactions in a biological cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates sufficient for life. Since enzymes are selective for their substrates and speed up only a few reactions from among many possibilities, the set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell.
Like all catalysts, enzymes work by lowering the activation energy (Ea‡) for a reaction, thus dramatically increasing the rate of the reaction. As a result, products are formed faster and reactions reach their equilibrium state more rapidly. Most enzyme reaction rates are millions of times faster than those of comparable un-catalyzed reactions. As with all catalysts, enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyze, nor do they alter the equilibrium of these reactions. However, enzymes do differ from most other catalysts in that they are highly specific for their substrates. Enzymes are known to catalyze about 4,000 biochemical reactions.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110601003507/http://www.expasy.org/NAR/enz00.pdf|format=PDF|author=Bairoch A.|year=2000|title=The ENZYME database in 2000 |journal=Nucleic Acids Res|volume=28|pages=304–5|pmid=10592255|doi=10.1093/nar/28.1.304|issue=1|pmc=102465[/tpl] A few RNA molecules called ribozymes also catalyze reactions, with an important example being some parts of the ribosome.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lilley D |title=Structure, folding and mechanisms of ribozymes |journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=313–23 |year=2005 |pmid=15919196 |doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2005.05.002[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Cech T |title=Structural biology.

Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules. Inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity; activators are molecules that increase activity. Many drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. Activity is also affected by temperature, pressure, chemical environment (e.g., pH), and the concentration of substrate. Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of antibiotics. In addition, some household products use enzymes to speed up biochemical reactions (e.g., enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein or fat stains on clothes; enzymes in meat tenderizers break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew).

==Etymology and history==

As early as the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the digestion of meat by stomach secretions[tpl]cite journal|last = de Réaumur|first = RAF|authorlink = René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur|year = 1752|title = Observations sur la digestion des oiseaux|journal = Histoire de l'academie royale des sciences|volume = 1752|pages = 266, 461[/tpl] and the conversion of starch to sugars by plant extracts and saliva were known. However, the mechanism by which this occurred had not been identified.Williams, H. S. (1904) A History of Science: in Five Volumes. Volume IV: Modern Development of the Chemical and Biological Sciences Harper and Brothers (New York) Accessed 4 April 2007
In 1833, French chemist Anselme Payen discovered the first enzyme, diastase.Payen, A. et J.-F. Persoz (1833) "Mémoire sur la diastase, les principaux produits de ses réactions et leurs applications aux arts industriels" (Memoir on diastase, the principal products of its reactions and their applications to the industrial arts), Annales de chimie et de physique, 2nd series, 53 :  73–92. A few decades later, when studying the fermentation of sugar to alcohol by yeast, Louis Pasteur came to the conclusion that this fermentation was catalyzed by a vital force contained within the yeast cells called "ferments", which were thought to function only within living organisms. He wrote that "alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated with the life and organization of the yeast cells, not with the death or putrefaction of the cells."[tpl]cite journal |author=Dubos J.|year=1951|title=Louis Pasteur: Free Lance of Science, Gollancz. Quoted in Manchester K. L. (1995) Louis Pasteur (1822–1895)—chance and the prepared mind|journal=Trends Biotechnol|volume=13|issue=12|pages=511–5|pmid=8595136 |doi=10.1016/S0167-7799(00)89014-9[/tpl]
In 1877, German physiologist Wilhelm Kühne (1837–1900) first used the term enzyme, which comes from Greek ἔνζυμον, "leavened", to describe this process.Kühne coined the word "enzyme" in: W. Kühne (1877) "Über das Verhalten verschiedener organisirter und sog. ungeformter Fermente" (On the behavior of various organized and so-called unformed ferments), Verhandlungen des naturhistorisch-medicinischen Vereins zu Heidelberg, new series, vol. 1, no. 3, pages 190–193. The relevant passage occurs on page 190: "Um Missverständnissen vorzubeugen und lästige Umschreibungen zu vermeiden schlägt Vortragender vor, die ungeformten oder nicht organisirten Fermente, deren Wirkung ohne Anwesenheit von Organismen und ausserhalb derselben erfolgen kann, als Enzyme zu bezeichnen." (Translation: In order to obviate misunderstandings and avoid cumbersome periphrases, author, a university lecturer suggests designating as "enzymes" the unformed or not organized ferments, whose action can occur without the presence of organisms and outside of the same.) The word enzyme was used later to refer to nonliving substances such as pepsin, and the word ferment was used to refer to chemical activity produced by living organisms.
In 1897, Eduard Buchner submitted his first paper on the ability of yeast extracts that lacked any living yeast cells to ferment sugar. In a series of experiments at the University of Berlin, he found that the sugar was fermented even when there were no living yeast cells in the mixture.Nobel Laureate Biography of Eduard Buchner at http://nobelprize.org. Retrieved 4 April 2007. He named the enzyme that brought about the fermentation of sucrose "zymase".Text of Eduard Buchner's 1907 Nobel lecture at http://nobelprize.org. Retrieved 4 April 2007. In 1907, he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry "for his biochemical research and his discovery of cell-free fermentation". Following Buchner's example, enzymes are usually named according to the reaction they carry out. Typically, to generate the name of an enzyme, the suffix -ase is added to the name of its substrate (e.g., lactase is the enzyme that cleaves lactose) or the type of reaction (e.g., DNA polymerase forms DNA polymers).The naming of enzymes by adding the suffix "-ase" to the substrate on which the enzyme acts, has been traced to French scientist Émile Duclaux (1840–1904), who intended to honor the discoverers of diastase – the first enzyme to be isolated – by introducing this practice in his book Traité de Microbiologie, vol. 2 (Paris, France: Masson and Co., 1899). See Chapter 1, especially page 9.
Having shown that enzymes could function outside a living cell, the next step was to determine their biochemical nature. Many early workers noted that enzymatic activity was associated with proteins, but several scientists (such as Nobel laureate Richard Willstätter) argued that proteins were merely carriers for the true enzymes and that proteins per se were incapable of catalysis.Willstätter, R. (1927). Problems and Methods in Enzyme Research. Cornell University Press, Ithaca. quoted in [tpl]cite journal|author=Blow, David|year=2000|url=http://cmgm3.stanford.edu/biochem/sb241/Herschlag_lectures/papers/Blow.pdf|title=So do we understand how enzymes work?|format=pdf|journal=Structure|volume=8|issue=4|pages=R77–R81|doi=10.1016/S0969-2126(00)00125-8|pmid=10801479[/tpl] However, in 1926, James B. Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was a pure protein and crystallized it; Sumner did likewise for the enzyme catalase in 1937. The conclusion that pure proteins can be enzymes was definitively proved by Northrop and Stanley, who worked on the digestive enzymes pepsin (1930), trypsin and chymotrypsin. These three scientists were awarded the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.1946 Nobel prize for Chemistry laureates at http://nobelprize.org. Retrieved 4 April 2007.
This discovery that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures to be solved by x-ray crystallography. This was first done for lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears, saliva and egg whites that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by David Chilton Phillips and published in 1965.[tpl]cite journal |author=Blake CC, Koenig DF, Mair GA, North AC, Phillips DC, Sarma VR.|year=1965|title=Structure of hen egg-white lysozyme. A three-dimensional Fourier synthesis at 2 Angstrom resolution |journal=Nature |volume=206|issue=4986|pages=757–61|pmid=5891407|doi=10.1038/206757a0[/tpl] This high-resolution structure of lysozyme marked the beginning of the field of structural biology and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.

==Structures and mechanisms==

Enzymes are in general globular proteins and range from just 62 amino acid residues in size, for the monomer of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase,[tpl]cite journal |author=Chen LH, Kenyon GL, Curtin F, Harayama S, Bembenek ME, Hajipour G, Whitman CP |title=4-Oxalocrotonate tautomerase, an enzyme composed of 62 amino acid residues per monomer |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=267 |issue=25 |pages=17716–21 |year=1992 |pmid=1339435[/tpl] to over 2,500 residues in the animal fatty acid synthase.[tpl]cite journal |author=Smith S |title=The animal fatty acid synthase: one gene, one polypeptide, seven enzymes |journal=FASEB J. |volume=8 |issue=15 |pages=1248–59 |date=1 December 1994 |pmid=8001737[/tpl] A small number of RNA-based biological catalysts exist, with the most common being the ribosome; these are referred to as either RNA-enzymes or ribozymes. The activities of enzymes are determined by their three-dimensional structure.[tpl]cite journal|author=Anfinsen C.B.|year=1973|title=Principles that Govern the Folding of Protein Chains|journal=Science|pages=223–30|pmid=4124164|doi=10.1126/science.181.4096.223|volume=181|issue=4096[/tpl] However, although structure does determine function, predicting a novel enzyme's activity just from its structure is a very difficult problem that has not yet been solved.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dunaway-Mariano D |title=Enzyme function discovery |journal=Structure |volume=16 |issue=11 |pages=1599–600 |year=2008|pmid=19000810 |doi=10.1016/j.str.2008.10.001[/tpl]
Most enzymes are much larger than the substrates they act on, and only a small portion of the enzyme (around 2–4 amino acids) is directly involved in catalysis.The Catalytic Site Atlas at The European Bioinformatics Institute. Retrieved 4 April 2007. The region that contains these catalytic residues, binds the substrate, and then carries out the reaction is known as the active site. Enzymes can also contain sites that bind cofactors, which are needed for catalysis. Some enzymes also have binding sites for small molecules, which are often direct or indirect products or substrates of the reaction catalyzed. This binding can serve to increase or decrease the enzyme's activity, providing a means for feedback regulation.
Like all proteins, enzymes are long, linear chains of amino acids that fold to produce a three-dimensional product. Each unique amino acid sequence produces a specific structure, which has unique properties. Individual protein chains may sometimes group together to form a protein complex. Most enzymes can be denatured—that is, unfolded and inactivated—by heating or chemical denaturants, which disrupt the three-dimensional structure of the protein. Depending on the enzyme, denaturation may be reversible or irreversible.
Structures of enzymes with substrates or substrate analogs during a reaction may be obtained using Time resolved crystallography methods.

===Specificity===

Enzymes are usually very specific as to which reactions they catalyze and the substrates that are involved in these reactions. Complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics of enzymes and substrates are responsible for this specificity. Enzymes can also show impressive levels of stereospecificity, regioselectivity and chemoselectivity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Jaeger KE, Eggert T.|year=2004|title=Enantioselective biocatalysis optimized by directed evolution| journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=15 |issue=4|pages=305–13|pmid=15358000|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2004.06.007[/tpl]
Some of the enzymes showing the highest specificity and accuracy are involved in the copying and expression of the genome. These enzymes have "proof-reading" mechanisms. Here, an enzyme such as DNA polymerase catalyzes a reaction in a first step and then checks that the product is correct in a second step.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shevelev IV, Hubscher U.|year=2002|title=The 3' 5' exonucleases| journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology |volume=3|issue=5|pages=364–76|pmid=11988770|doi=10.1038/nrm804[/tpl] This two-step process results in average error rates of less than 1 error in 100 million reactions in high-fidelity mammalian polymerases.[tpl]cite book |author=Tymoczko, John L.; Stryer Berg Tymoczko; Stryer, Lubert; Berg, Jeremy Mark |title=Biochemistry |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2002 |isbn=0-7167-4955-6[/tpl] Similar proofreading mechanisms are also found in RNA polymerase,[tpl]cite journal |author=Zenkin N, Yuzenkova Y, Severinov K.|year=2006|title=Transcript-assisted transcriptional proofreading| journal=Science.|volume=313|pages=518–20|pmid=16873663|doi=10.1126/science.1127422 |issue=5786[/tpl] aminoacyl tRNA synthetases[tpl]cite journal |author=Ibba M, Soll D.|year=2000|title=Aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis|journal=Annu Rev Biochem. |volume=69 |pages=617–50 |pmid=10966471 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.617[/tpl] and ribosomes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rodnina MV, Wintermeyer W.|year=2001|title=Fidelity of aminoacyl-tRNA selection on the ribosome: kinetic and structural mechanisms| journal=Annu Rev Biochem.|volume=70|pages=415–35|pmid=11395413|doi =10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.415[/tpl]
Whereas some enzymes have broad-specificity, as they can act on a relatively broad range of different physiologically relevant substrates, many enzymes possess small side activities which arose fortuitously (i.e. neutrally), which may be the starting point for the evolutionary selection of a new function; this phenomenon is known as enzyme promiscuity.[tpl]cite pmid|20235827[/tpl]

===="Lock and key" model====

Enzymes are very specific, and it was suggested by Emil Fischer in 1894 that this was because both the enzyme and the substrate possess specific complementary geometric shapes that fit exactly into one another.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fischer E.|year=1894|title=Einfluss der Configuration auf die Wirkung der Enzyme|trans_title=Influence of configuration on the action of enzymes| journal=Berichte der Deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin|volume=27|pages=2985–93|url =http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90736r/f364.chemindefer|doi=10.1002/cber.18940270364 |issue=3[/tpl]  From page 2992:  "Um ein Bild zu gebrauchen, will ich sagen, dass Enzym und Glucosid wie Schloss und Schlüssel zu einander passen müssen, um eine chemische Wirkung auf einander ausüben zu können."  (To use an image, I will say that an enzyme and a glucoside glucose derivative must fit like a lock and key, in order to be able to exert a chemical effect on each other.) This is often referred to as "the lock and key" model. However, while this model explains enzyme specificity, it fails to explain the stabilization of the transition state that enzymes achieve.
In 1958, Daniel Koshland suggested a modification to the lock and key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.44.2.98|author=Koshland D. E.|year=1958|title=Application of a Theory of Enzyme Specificity to Protein Synthesis|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.|volume=44|issue=2|pages=98–104|pmid=16590179|pmc=335371[/tpl] As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains that make up the active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site.[tpl]cite journal|author=Vasella A, Davies GJ, Bohm M.|year=2002|title=Glycosidase mechanisms|journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology|volume=6|issue=5|pages=619–29|pmid=12413546|doi=10.1016/S1367-5931(02)00380-0[/tpl] The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge is determined.[tpl]cite book |last=Boyer |first=Rodney |title=Concepts in Biochemistry |origyear=2002|edition=2nd |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |location=New York, Chichester, Weinheim, Brisbane, Singapore, Toronto. |isbn=0-470-00379-0 |pages=137–8 |chapter=6 |year=2002 |oclc=51720783[/tpl]
Induced fit may enhance the fidelity of molecular recognition in the presence of competition and noise via the conformational proofreading mechanism.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000468 |year=2007|author =Savir Y & Tlusty T |title=Conformational proofreading: the impact of conformational changes on the specificity of molecular recognition |volume=2 |issue= 5|pages=e468 |journal=PLoS ONE|url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/PLoSONE2007.pdf |pmid=17520027 |pmc=1868595 |editor1-last=Scalas |editor1-first=Enrico[/tpl]
Based on Fischer's lock-and-key model and Koshland’s induced fit theory, the Chou’s distorted key theory for peptide drugs was proposed

===Mechanisms===

Enzymes can act in several ways, all of which lower ΔG‡ (Gibbs energy):[tpl]cite book |author=Fersht, Alan |title=Enzyme structure and mechanism |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=1985 |pages=50–2 |isbn=0-7167-1615-1[/tpl]
It is interesting that this entropic effect involves destabilization of the ground state,[tpl]cite book |author=Jencks, William P. |title=Catalysis in chemistry and enzymology |publisher=Dover |location=Mineola, N.Y |year=1987 |isbn=0-486-65460-5[/tpl] and its contribution to catalysis is relatively small.[tpl]cite journal |author=Villa J, Strajbl M, Glennon TM, Sham YY, Chu ZT, Warshel A |title=How important are entropic contributions to enzyme catalysis? |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=97 |issue=22 |pages=11899–904 |year=2000 |pmid=11050223 |doi=10.1073/pnas.97.22.11899 |pmc=17266[/tpl]

====Transition state stabilization====

The understanding of the origin of the reduction of ΔG‡ requires one to find out how the enzymes can stabilize its transition state more than the transition state of the uncatalyzed reaction. It seems that the most effective way for reaching large stabilization is the use of electrostatic effects, in particular, when having a relatively fixed polar environment that is oriented toward the charge distribution of the transition state.[tpl]cite journal |author=Warshel A, Sharma PK, Kato M, Xiang Y, Liu H, Olsson MH |title=Electrostatic basis for enzyme catalysis |journal=Chem. Rev. |volume=106 |issue=8 |pages=3210–35 |year=2006 |pmid=16895325|doi =10.1021/cr0503106[/tpl] Such an environment does not exist in the uncatalyzed reaction in water.

====Dynamics and function====

The internal dynamics of enzymes has been suggested to be linked with their mechanism of catalysis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Eisenmesser EZ, Bosco DA, Akke M, Kern D |title=Enzyme dynamics during catalysis |journal=Science |volume=295 |issue=5559 |pages=1520–3 |year=2002 |pmid=11859194 |doi=10.1126/science.1066176[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Agarwal PK |title=Role of protein dynamics in reaction rate enhancement by enzymes |journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc. |volume=127 |issue=43 |pages=15248–56 |year=2005 |pmid=16248667 |doi=10.1021/ja055251s[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Eisenmesser EZ, Millet O, Labeikovsky W |title=Intrinsic dynamics of an enzyme underlies catalysis |journal=Nature |volume=438 |issue=7064 |pages=117–21 |year=2005|pmid=16267559 |doi=10.1038/nature04105[/tpl]
Internal dynamics are the movement of parts of the enzyme's structure, such as individual amino acid residues, a group of amino acids, or even an entire protein domain. These movements occur at various time-scales ranging from femtoseconds to seconds. Networks of protein residues throughout an enzyme's structure can contribute to catalysis through dynamic motions.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.cell.com/structure/abstract/S0969-2126%2805%2900167-X |author=Yang LW, Bahar I |title=Coupling between catalytic site and collective dynamics: A requirement for mechanochemical activity of enzymes| journal=Structure |date=5 June 2005 |volume=13 |pages=893–904 |pmid=15939021 |doi=10.1016/j.str.2005.03.015|issue=6|pmc=1489920[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.052005999 |author=Agarwal PK, Billeter SR, Rajagopalan PT, Benkovic SJ, Hammes-Schiffer S.|title=Network of coupled promoting motions in enzyme catalysis| journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.|date=5 March 2002 |volume=99 |pages=2794–9 |pmid=11867722 |issue=5 |pmc=122427[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Agarwal PK, Geist A, Gorin A |title=Protein dynamics and enzymatic catalysis: investigating the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization activity of cyclophilin A |journal=Biochemistry |volume=43 |issue=33 |pages=10605–18 |year=2004 |pmid=15311922 |doi=10.1021/bi0495228[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Tousignant A, Pelletier JN.|title=Protein motions promote catalysis|journal=Chem Biol.|year=2004|volume=11|issue=8|pages=1037–42|pmid=15324804 |doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2004.06.007[/tpl] This is simply seen in the kinetic scheme of the combined process, enzymatic activity and dynamics; this scheme can have several independent Michaelis-Menten-like reaction pathways that are connected through fluctuation rates.[tpl]cite journal |author=Flomenbom O |title=Stretched exponential decay and correlations in the catalytic activity of fluctuating single lipase molecules |journal=Proc.

Protein motions are vital to many enzymes, but whether small and fast vibrations, or larger and slower conformational movements are more important depends on the type of reaction involved. However, although these movements are important in binding and releasing substrates and products, it is not clear if protein movements help to accelerate the chemical steps in enzymatic reactions.[tpl]cite journal|title=Dynamical Contributions to Enzyme Catalysis: Critical Tests of A Popular Hypothesis |journal=Chem. Rev. |volume=106 |issue=5 |pages=1737–56 |year=2006 |doi=10.1021/cr040427e |pmid=16683752 |last1=Olsson |first1=MH |last2=Parson |first2=WW |last3=Warshel |first3=A[/tpl] These new insights also have implications in understanding allosteric effects and developing new medicines.

===Allosteric modulation===

Allosteric sites are sites on the enzyme that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. The sites form weak, noncovalent bonds with these molecules, causing a change in the conformation of the enzyme. This change in conformation translates to the active site, which then affects the reaction rate of the enzyme.[tpl]cite journal |author=Neet KE |title=Cooperativity in enzyme function: equilibrium and kinetic aspects |journal=Meth. Enzymol. |volume=249 |pages=519–67 |year=1995 |pmid=7791626 |doi=10.1016/0076-6879(95)49048-5 |series=Methods in Enzymology |isbn=978-0-12-182150-0[/tpl] Allosteric interactions can both inhibit and activate enzymes and are a common way that enzymes are controlled in the body.[tpl]cite journal |author=Changeux JP, Edelstein SJ |title=Allosteric mechanisms of signal transduction |journal=Science |volume=308 |issue=5727 |pages=1424–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15933191 |doi=10.1126/science.1108595[/tpl]

==Cofactors and coenzymes==

===Cofactors===

Some enzymes do not need any additional components to show full activity. However, others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/bioinorg/CD.html#34 |title=Glossary of Terms Used in Bioinorganic Chemistry: Cofactor |accessdate=30 October 2007 |last=de Bolster |first=M.W.G. |year=1997 |publisher=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry[/tpl] Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). Organic cofactors can be either prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme, or coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction. Coenzymes include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate. These molecules transfer chemical groups between enzymes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/bioinorg/CD.html#33 |title=Glossary of Terms Used in Bioinorganic Chemistry: Coenzyme |accessdate=30 October 2007 |last=de Bolster |first=M.W.G. |year=1997 |publisher=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry[/tpl]
An example of an enzyme that contains a cofactor is carbonic anhydrase, and is shown in the ribbon diagram above with a zinc cofactor bound as part of its active site.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fisher Z, Hernandez Prada JA, Tu C, Duda D, Yoshioka C, An H, Govindasamy L, Silverman DN and McKenna R.|year=2005|title=Structural and kinetic characterization of active-site histidine as a proton shuttle in catalysis by human carbonic anhydrase II| journal=Biochemistry.|volume=44 |issue=4|pages=1097–115|pmid=15667203|doi=10.1021/bi0480279[/tpl] These tightly bound molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis. For example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in redox reactions.
Enzymes that require a cofactor but do not have one bound are called apoenzymes or apoproteins. An apoenzyme together with its cofactor(s) is called a holoenzyme (this is the active form). Most cofactors are not covalently attached to an enzyme, but are very tightly bound. However, organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase). The term "holoenzyme" can also be applied to enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as the DNA polymerases; here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the subunits needed for activity.

===Coenzymes===

Coenzymes are small organic molecules that can be loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Tightly bound coenzymes can be called prosthetic groups. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another.[tpl]cite book |author=Wagner, Arthur L. |title=Vitamins and Coenzymes |publisher=Krieger Pub Co |year=1975 |isbn=0-88275-258-8[/tpl] Some of these chemicals such as riboflavin, thiamine and folic acid are vitamins (compounds that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be acquired from the diet). The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H-) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.
Since coenzymes are chemically changed as a consequence of enzyme action, it is useful to consider coenzymes to be a special class of substrates, or second substrates, which are common to many different enzymes. For example, about 700 enzymes are known to use the coenzyme NADH.BRENDA The Comprehensive Enzyme Information System. Retrieved 4 April 2007.
Coenzymes are usually continuously regenerated and their concentrations maintained at a steady level inside the cell: for example, NADPH is regenerated through the pentose phosphate pathway and S-adenosylmethionine by methionine adenosyltransferase. This continuous regeneration means that even small amounts of coenzymes are used very intensively. For example, the human body turns over its own weight in ATP each day.[tpl]cite journal |author=Törnroth-Horsefield S, Neutze R |title=Opening and closing the metabolite gate |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=105 |issue=50 |pages=19565–6 |year=2008 |pmid=19073922 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0810654106 |pmc=2604989[/tpl]

==Thermodynamics==

As all catalysts, enzymes do not alter the position of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction. Usually, in the presence of an enzyme, the reaction runs in the same direction as it would without the enzyme, just more quickly. However, in the absence of the enzyme, other possible uncatalyzed, "spontaneous" reactions might lead to different products, because in those conditions this different product is formed faster.
Furthermore, enzymes can couple two or more reactions, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to "drive" a thermodynamically unfavorable one. For example, the hydrolysis of ATP is often used to drive other chemical reactions.[tpl]cite book |author=Ferguson, S. J.; Nicholls, David; Ferguson, Stuart |title=Bioenergetics 3 |publisher=Academic |location=San Diego |year=2002 |isbn=0-12-518121-3 |edition=3rd[/tpl]
Enzymes catalyze the forward and backward reactions equally. They do not alter the equilibrium itself, but only the speed at which it is reached. For example, carbonic anhydrase catalyzes its reaction in either direction depending on the concentration of its reactants.
Nevertheless, if the equilibrium is greatly displaced in one direction, that is, in a very exergonic reaction, the reaction is in effect irreversible. Under these conditions, the enzyme will, in fact, catalyze the reaction only in the thermodynamically allowed direction.

==Kinetics==

Enzyme kinetics is the investigation of how enzymes bind substrates and turn them into products. The rate data used in kinetic analyses are commonly obtained from enzyme assays, where since the 90s, the dynamics of many enzymes are studied on the level of individual molecules.
In 1902 Victor Henri proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics,[tpl]cite journal|author=Henri, V.|year=1902|title=Theorie generale de l'action de quelques diastases|journal=Compt. Rend. Hebd. Acad. Sci. Paris|volume=135|pages=916–9[/tpl] but his experimental data were not useful because the significance of the hydrogen ion concentration was not yet appreciated. After Peter Lauritz Sørensen had defined the logarithmic pH-scale and introduced the concept of buffering in 1909[tpl]cite journal|author=Sørensen,P.L.|year=1909|title=Enzymstudien {II}. Über die Messung und Bedeutung der Wasserstoffionenkonzentration bei enzymatischen Prozessen|journal=Biochem. Z.|volume=21|pages=131–304[/tpl] the German chemist Leonor Michaelis and his Canadian postdoc Maud Leonora Menten repeated Henri's experiments and confirmed his equation, which is referred to as Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics (termed also Michaelis-Menten kinetics).[tpl]cite journal|author=Michaelis L., Menten M.|year=1913|title=Die Kinetik der Invertinwirkung|journal=Biochem. Z.|volume=49|pages=333–369[/tpl] English translation. Retrieved 6 April 2007. Their work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely considered today a starting point in solving enzymatic activity.[tpl]cite journal|author=Briggs G. E., Haldane J. B. S.|year=1925|title=A note on the kinetics of enzyme action|journal=Biochem. J.|volume=19|pages=339–339|pmid=16743508|issue=2|pmc=1259181[/tpl]
The major contribution of Henri was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis complex. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. Note that the simple Michaelis Menten mechanism for the enzymatic activity is considered today a basic idea, where many examples show that the enzymatic activity involves structural dynamics. This is incorporated in the enzymatic mechanism while introducing several Michaelis Menten pathways that are connected with fluctuating rates. Nevertheless, there is a mathematical relation connecting the behavior obtained from the basic Michaelis Menten mechanism (that was indeed proved correct in many experiments) with the generalized Michaelis Menten mechanisms involving dynamics and activity;
 this means that the measured activity of enzymes on the level of many enzymes may be explained with the simple Michaelis-Menten equation, yet, the actual activity of enzymes is richer and involves structural dynamics.
Enzymes can catalyze up to several million reactions per second. For example, the uncatalyzed decarboxylation of orotidine 5'-monophosphate has a half life of 78 million years. However, when the enzyme orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase is added, the same process takes just 25 milliseconds.[tpl]cite journal |author=Radzicka A, Wolfenden R.|year=1995|title=A proficient enzyme |journal=Science |volume=267|issue=5194|pages=90–931|pmid=7809611|doi =10.1126/science.7809611[/tpl] Enzyme rates depend on solution conditions and substrate concentration. Conditions that denature the protein abolish enzyme activity, such as high temperatures, extremes of pH or high salt concentrations, while raising substrate concentration tends to increase activity when S is low. To find the maximum speed of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This is shown in the saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, more and more of the free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES form. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.
However, Vmax is only one kinetic constant of enzymes. The amount of substrate needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also important. This is given by the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a characteristic Km for a given substrate. Another useful constant is kcat
The efficiency of an enzyme can be expressed in terms of kcat/Km. This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the rate constants for all steps in the reaction. Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 108 to 109 (M−1 s−1). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called catalytically perfect or kinetically perfect. Example of such enzymes are triose-phosphate isomerase, carbonic anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, catalase, fumarase, β-lactamase, and superoxide dismutase.
Michaelis-Menten kinetics relies on the law of mass action, which is derived from the assumptions of free diffusion and thermodynamically driven random collision. However, many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of macromolecular crowding, phase-separation of the enzyme/substrate/product, or one or two-dimensional molecular movement.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ellis RJ |title=Macromolecular crowding: obvious but underappreciated |journal=Trends Biochem. Sci. |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=597–604 |year=2001 |pmid=11590012 |doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(01)01938-7[/tpl] In these situations, a fractal Michaelis-Menten kinetics may be applied.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kopelman R |title=Fractal Reaction Kinetics |journal=Science |volume=241 |issue=4873 |pages=1620–26 |year=1988|doi =10.1126/science.241.4873.1620 |pmid=17820893[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Savageau MA |title=Michaelis-Menten mechanism reconsidered: implications of fractal kinetics |journal=J.

Some enzymes operate with kinetics, which are faster than diffusion rates, which would seem to be impossible. Several mechanisms have been invoked to explain this phenomenon. Some proteins are believed to accelerate catalysis by drawing their substrate in and pre-orienting them by using dipolar electric fields. Other models invoke a quantum-mechanical tunneling explanation, whereby a proton or an electron can tunnel through activation barriers, although for proton tunneling this model remains somewhat controversial.[tpl]cite journal|author=Garcia-Viloca M., Gao J., Karplus M., Truhlar D. G.|year=2004|title=How enzymes work: analysis by modern rate theory and computer simulations|journal=Science|volume=303|issue=5655|pages=186–95|pmid=14716003 |doi=10.1126/science.1088172[/tpl][ref]

==Inhibition==

Enzyme reaction rates can be decreased by various types of enzyme inhibitors.
In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor and substrate compete for the enzyme (i.e., they can not bind at the same time).[tpl]cite journal |author=Price, NC. |year=1979 |title=What is meant by 'competitive inhibition'? |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |volume=4|pages=pN272 |doi=10.1016/0968-0004(79)90205-6 |issue=11[/tpl] Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of folic acid and this drug are shown in the figure to the right bottom. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change the shape of the usual binding-site. For example, strychnine acts as an allosteric inhibitor of the glycine receptor in the mammalian spinal cord and brain stem. Glycine is a major post-synaptic inhibitory neurotransmitter with a specific receptor site. Strychnine binds to an alternate site that reduces the affinity of the glycine receptor for glycine, resulting in convulsions due to lessened inhibition by the glycine.[tpl]cite book| title= Pharmacology for Nurse Anesthesiology |editor= Ouellette, Richard G.; Joyce, Joseph A. |year= 2011 |publisher= Jones & Bartlett Learning |isbn= 978-0-7637-8607-6 |chapter= Chapter 2. Pharmacodynamics: The Study of Drug Action |author= Dick, Ronald M. [/tpl] In competitive inhibition the maximal rate of the reaction is not changed, but higher substrate concentrations are required to reach a given maximum rate, increasing the apparent Km.
In uncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor cannot bind to the free enzyme, only to the ES-complex. The EIS-complex thus formed is enzymatically inactive. This type of inhibition is rare, but may occur in multimeric enzymes.
Non-competitive inhibitors can bind to the enzyme at the binding site at the same time as the substrate,but not to the active site. Both the EI and EIS complexes are enzymatically inactive. Because the inhibitor can not be driven from the enzyme by higher substrate concentration (in contrast to competitive inhibition), the apparent Vmax changes. But because the substrate can still bind to the enzyme, the Km stays the same.
This type of inhibition resembles the non-competitive, except that the EIS-complex has residual enzymatic activity.This type of inhibitor does not follow Michaelis-Menten equation.
In many organisms, inhibitors may act as part of a feedback mechanism. If an enzyme produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance may act as an inhibitor for the enzyme at the beginning of the pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance to slow down or stop when there is sufficient amount. This is a form of negative feedback. Enzymes that are subject to this form of regulation are often multimeric and have allosteric binding sites for regulatory substances. Their substrate/velocity plots are not hyperbolar, but sigmoidal (S-shaped).
Irreversible inhibitors react with the enzyme and form a covalent adduct with the protein. The inactivation is irreversible. These compounds include eflornithine a drug used to treat the parasitic disease sleeping sickness.[tpl]cite journal|author1 = R Poulin|last2 = Lu|first2 = L|last3 = Ackermann|first3 = B|last4 = Bey|first4 = P|last5 = Pegg|first5 = AE|title = Mechanism of the irreversible inactivation of mouse ornithine decarboxylase by alpha-difluoromethylornithine. Characterization of sequences at the inhibitor and coenzyme binding sites|journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume = 267|issue = 1|pages = 150–8|date = 5 January 1992|pmid = 1730582[/tpl] Penicillin and Aspirin also act in this manner. With these drugs, the compound is bound in the active site and the enzyme then converts the inhibitor into an activated form that reacts irreversibly with one or more amino acid residues.
Since inhibitors modulate the function of enzymes they are often used as drugs. A common example of an inhibitor that is used as a drug is aspirin, which inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes that produce the inflammation messenger prostaglandin, thus suppressing pain and inflammation. However, other enzyme inhibitors are poisons. For example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks cellular respiration.[tpl]cite journal|author=Yoshikawa S and Caughey WS.|date=15 May 1990|volume=265|issue=14|title=Infrared evidence of cyanide binding to iron and copper sites in bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase. Implications regarding oxygen reduction|journal=J Biol Chem.|pages=7945–58|pmid=2159465[/tpl]

==Biological function==

Enzymes serve a wide variety of functions inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal transduction and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hunter T.|year=1995|title=Protein kinases and phosphatases: the yin and yang of protein phosphorylation and signaling|journal=Cell.|volume=80 |issue=2|pages=225–36|pmid=7834742|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90405-0[/tpl] They also generate movement, with myosin hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction and also moving cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton.[tpl]cite journal |author=Berg JS, Powell BC, Cheney RE |title=A millennial myosin census |journal=Mol. Biol. Cell |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=780–94 |date=1 April 2001 |pmid=11294886 |pmc=32266 |doi=10.1091/mbc.12.4.780 [/tpl] Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies.[tpl]cite journal |author=Meighen EA |title=Molecular biology of bacterial bioluminescence |journal=Microbiol. Rev. |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=123–42 |date=1 March 1991 |pmid=2030669 |pmc=372803 [/tpl] Viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus neuraminidase.
An important function of enzymes is in the digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, so they can be absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mackie RI, White BA |title=Recent advances in rumen microbial ecology and metabolism: potential impact on nutrient output |journal=J. Dairy Sci. |volume=73 |issue=10 |pages=2971–95 |date=1 October 1990 |pmid=2178174 |doi=10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(90)78986-2[/tpl]
Several enzymes can work together in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways. In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme.
Enzymes determine what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither progress through the same steps nor be fast enough to serve the needs of the cell. Indeed, a metabolic pathway such as glycolysis could not exist independently of enzymes. Glucose, for example, can react directly with ATP to become phosphorylated at one or more of its carbons. In the absence of enzymes, this occurs so slowly as to be insignificant. However, if hexokinase is added, these slow reactions continue to take place except that phosphorylation at carbon 6 occurs so rapidly that, if the mixture is tested a short time later, glucose-6-phosphate is found to be the only significant product. As a consequence, the network of metabolic pathways within each cell depends on the set of functional enzymes that are present.

==Control of activity==

There are five main ways that enzyme activity is controlled in the cell.

==Involvement in disease==

Since the tight control of enzyme activity is essential for homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme can lead to a genetic disease. The importance of enzymes is shown by the fact that a lethal illness can be caused by the malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in our bodies.
One example is the most common type of phenylketonuria. A mutation of a single amino acid in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the first step in the degradation of phenylalanine, results in build-up of phenylalanine and related products. This can lead to intellectual disability if the disease is untreated.Phenylketonuria: NCBI Genes and Disease. Retrieved 4 April 2007. Another example of enzyme deficiency is pseudocholinesterase[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl], in which the body's ability to break down choline ester drugs is impaired.[tpl]cite web|title=Pseudocholinesterase deficiency|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/pseudocholinesterase-deficiency|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=5 September 2013[/tpl]
A further example is when germline mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes cause hereditary cancer syndromes such as xeroderma pigmentosum. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer since the body is less able to repair mutations in the genome. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results in the development of many types of cancer in the sufferer.
Oral administration of enzymes can be used to treat several diseases (e.g. pancreatic insufficiency and lactose intolerance). Since enzymes are proteins themselves they are potentially subject to inactivation and digestion in the gastrointestinal environment. Therefore a non-invasive imaging assay was developed to monitor gastrointestinal activity of exogenous enzymes (prolyl endopeptidase as potential adjuvant therapy for celiac disease) in vivo.[tpl]cite journal|author=Fuhrmann G, Leroux JC |year=2011|title= In vivo fluorescence imaging of exogenous enzyme activity in the gastrointestinal tract|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume= 108|pages= 9032–9037|doi=10.1073/pnas.1100285108|issue=22|pmid=21576491|pmc=3107327[/tpl]

==Naming conventions==

An enzyme's name is often derived from its substrate or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, with the word ending in -ase. Examples are lactase, alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase. This may result in different enzymes, called isozymes, with the same function having the same basic name. Isoenzymes have a different amino acid sequence and might be distinguished by their optimal pH, kinetic properties or immunologically. Isoenzyme and isozyme are homologous proteins. Furthermore, the normal physiological reaction an enzyme catalyzes may not be the same as under artificial conditions. This can result in the same enzyme being identified with two different names. For example, glucose isomerase, which is used industrially to convert glucose into the sweetener fructose, is a xylose isomerase in vivo (within the body).
The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology have developed a nomenclature for enzymes, the EC numbers; each enzyme is described by a sequence of four numbers preceded by "EC".
The first number broadly classifies the enzyme based on its mechanism.
The top-level classification isThe complete nomenclature can be browsed at Enzyme Nomenclature. Recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology on the Nomenclature and Classification of Enzymes by the Reactions they Catalyse.

According to the naming conventions, enzymes are generally classified into six main family classes and many sub-family classes. Some web-servers, e.g.,

==Industrial applications==

Enzymes are used in the chemical industry and other industrial applications when extremely specific catalysts are required. However, enzymes in general are limited in the number of reactions they have evolved to catalyze and also by their lack of stability in organic solvents and at high temperatures. As a consequence, protein engineering is an active area of research and involves attempts to create new enzymes with novel properties, either through rational design or in vitro evolution.[tpl]cite journal|author=Renugopalakrishnan V, Garduno-Juarez R, Narasimhan G, Verma CS, Wei X, Li P.|year=2005|title=Rational design of thermally stable proteins: relevance to bionanotechnology|journal=J Nanosci Nanotechnol.|volume=5|issue=11|pages=1759–1767|pmid=16433409|doi=10.1166/jnn.2005.441[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Hult K, Berglund P.|year=2003|title=Engineered enzymes for improved organic synthesis|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=14|issue=4|pages=395–400|pmid=12943848|doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(03)00095-8[/tpl] These efforts have begun to be successful, and a few enzymes have now been designed "from scratch" to catalyze reactions that do not occur in nature.[tpl]cite journal |author=Jiang L, Althoff EA, Clemente FR |title=De novo computational design of retro-aldol enzymes |journal=Science |volume=319 |issue=5868 |pages=1387–91 |year=2008 |pmid=18323453 |doi=10.1126/science.1152692 |last12=Houk |first12=KN |last13=Stoddard |first13=BL |last14=Baker |first14=D |pmc=3431203[/tpl]
