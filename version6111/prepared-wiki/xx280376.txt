==History==

In 1925, J.M. Smith Sr., R.Ph., founded Smith Drug Company as an indepentent pharmacy in Asheville, North Carolina. As the changing economy of the 1940's, rigors of contstant travel and shortages imposed by World War II began to take their toll, J.M. Smith began divesting his retail chain of drug stores and incorporated Smith Drug Company in 1943. The wholesale drug operation began in the attic of the original Smith Drug Store in Spartanburg, South Carolina and now manages three large distribution centers across the southeastern United States.
