[[Rhotic consonant]]

CATEGORIES: Consonants, Phonology, Phonetics

In phonetics, rhotic consonants, also called tremulants or "R-like" sounds, are liquid consonants that are traditionally represented orthographically by symbols derived from the Greek letter rho, including [tpl]angle bracket|R[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|r[/tpl] in the Latin script and [tpl]angle bracket|Р[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|p[/tpl] in the Cyrillic script. They are transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet by upper- or lower-case variants of Roman [tpl]angle bracket|R[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|r[/tpl]: [tpl]IPA link|r[/tpl],  [tpl]IPA link|ɾ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA link|ɹ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA link|ɻ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA link|ʀ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA link|ʁ[/tpl], [tpl]IPA link|ɽ[/tpl], and [tpl]IPA link|ɺ[/tpl].
This class of sounds is difficult to characterise phonetically; from a phonetic standpoint, there is no single articulatory correlate common to rhotic consonants.[tpl]Cite journal|last= Lindau |first= Mona |year= 1978 | title=Vowel features |journal=Language |volume=54 |pages=541–63 |doi= 10.2307/412786 |issue= 3 | jstor= 412786[/tpl] Rhotics have instead been found to carry out similar phonological functions or to have certain similar phonological features across different languages.[tpl]Cite book | last=Wiese |first=Richard |title=Distinctive Feature Theory |year=2001 | publisher =Mouton de Gruyter |location=Berlin |isbn= 3-11-017033-7 |chapter= The phonology of /r/ | editor= T Alan Hall[/tpl] Although some have been found to share certain acoustic peculiarities, such as a lowered third formant,[tpl]Citation needed| date=April 2010[/tpl] further study has revealed that this does not hold true across different languages.[tpl]Citation needed | date = April 2010[/tpl]  For example, the acoustic quality of lowered third formants pertains almost exclusively to American varieties of English.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] Being "R-like" is an elusive and ambiguous concept phonetically and the same sounds that function as rhotics in some systems may pattern with fricatives, semivowels or even stops in others—for example, "tt" in American English "better" is often pronounced as an alveolar tap, a rhotic consonant in many other languages.

==Types==

The most typical rhotic sounds found in the world's languages are the following:[tpl]Cite book|last=Ladefoged |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Ladefoged |coauthors=Ian Maddieson |title=The Sounds of the World's Languages |year=1996 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |isbn=0-631-19814-8 |chapter=Rhotics |pages=215–245[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

In broad transcription rhotics are usually symbolised as [tpl]IPA|/r/[/tpl] unless there are two or more types of rhotic in the same language; for example, most Australian Aboriginal languages, which contrast approximant [tpl]IPA|ɻ[/tpl] and trill [tpl]IPA|r[/tpl], use the symbols r and rr respectively.  The IPA has a full set of different symbols which can be used whenever more phonetic precision is required: an r rotated 180° [tpl]IPA|ɹ[/tpl] for the alveolar approximant, a small capital R [tpl]IPA|ʀ[/tpl] for the uvular trill, and a flipped small capital R [tpl]IPA|ʁ[/tpl] for the voiced uvular fricative or approximant.
The fact that the sounds conventionally classified as "rhotics" vary greatly in both place and manner in terms of articulation, and also in their acoustic characteristics, has led several linguists to investigate what, if anything, they have in common that justifies grouping them together. One suggestion that has been made is that each member of the class of rhotics shares certain properties with other members of the class, but not necessarily the same properties with all; in this case, rhotics have a "family resemblance" with each other rather than a strict set of shared properties. Another suggestion is that rhotics are defined by their behaviour on the sonority hierarchy, namely, that a rhotic is any sound that patterns as being more sonorous than a lateral consonant but less sonorous than a vowel. The potential for variation within the class of rhotics makes them a popular area for research in sociolinguistics.[tpl]Cite book|last=Scobbie |first=James |editor=Roger Brown|title=Encyclopaedia of Language and Linguistics | edition=2nd |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-08-044299-0 |chapter=(R) as a variable | pages=337–344[/tpl]
