[[White Peak]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Derbyshire, Geography of Staffordshire, Peak District, Natural regions of England

The White Peak is the lower, southern part of the Peak District in England. In contrast to the Dark Peak, the underlying limestone is not capped by impervious millstone grit, so caves and dry river valleys are common features of the area. The soils are poor and calcareous, creating grazing land for both sheep and cattle.
Broadly speaking, the White Peak covers the Staffordshire Peaks, the Cheshire Peaks around Macclesfield and the Derbyshire Peaks from the Hope Valley southwards.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.peakdistrictonline.co.uk/the-white-peak-c10738.html |title=The White Peak |publisher=peakdistrictonline.co.uk |accessdate=4 April 2013[/tpl] The White Peak is one of 159 National Character Areas defined by Natural England; their defined area covers an area of [tpl]convert|52,860|ha|sqmi|0[/tpl] and includes the area approximately bounded by Buxton, Castleston, Matlock, Wirksworth and Cheadle, Staffordshire.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/52_White_Peak_tcm6-32335.pdf |title=NCA 52: White Peak Key Facts & Data |publisher=Natural England |accessdate=4 April 2013[/tpl]
The largest towns in the White Peak are outside the area of the Peak District national park.  These towns include Matlock and Buxton, while Bakewell and most of the villages in the park are in the White Peak area. Round the areas of Tideswell, Flagg, Chelmorton and Youlgrave, you can see long thin fields created by the enclosure of medieval strip fields. The region is rich in footpaths, bridleways and green tracks that give access to the area. Longer distance ones include the Limestone Way and the Pennine Bridleway, and former railway trackbeds such as the Monsal Trail, the High Peak Trail, the Tissington Trail and the Manifold Way.
The area is of interest to geologists, since  much of the underlying strata have been exposed by extensive quarrying, and can be seen in the old railway cuttings along the Monsal Trail through Monsal Dale and Millers Dale.
