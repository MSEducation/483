CATEGORIES: Chromosomes, Nuclear substructures, Cytogenetics

A chromosome is a structure of DNA, protein, and RNA found in cells. It is a single piece of coiled DNA containing many genes, regulatory elements and other nucleotide sequences. Chromosomes also contain DNA-bound proteins, which serve to package the DNA and control its functions. Chromosomal DNA encodes most or all of an organism's genetic information; some species also contain plasmids or other extrachromosomal genetic elements.
Chromosomes vary widely between different organisms. The DNA molecule may be circular or linear, and can be composed of 100,000 to over 3,750,000,000[tpl]cite journal|author=Paux E, Sourdille P, Salse J, et al.|title=A Physical Map of the 1-Gigabase Bread Wheat Chromosome 3B|journal=Science|volume=322|issue=5898|pages=101–104|year=2008|doi=10.1126/science.1161847 |pmid=18832645[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Pellicer J, Fay M F and Leitch I J|title=The largest eukaryotic genome of them all?|journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=164|pages=10–15|year=2010|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2010.01072.x[/tpl] nucleotides in a long chain. Typically, eukaryotic cells (cells with nuclei) have large linear chromosomes and prokaryotic cells (cells without defined nuclei) have smaller circular chromosomes, although there are many exceptions to this rule. Cells may contain more than one type of chromosome; for example, mitochondria in most eukaryotes and chloroplasts in plants have their own small chromosomes.
In eukaryotes, nuclear chromosomes are packaged by proteins into a condensed structure called chromatin. This allows the very long DNA molecules to fit into the cell nucleus. The structure of chromosomes and chromatin varies through the cell cycle. Chromosomes are even more condensed than chromatin and are an essential unit for cellular division.  Chromosomes must be replicated, divided, and passed successfully to their daughter cells so as to ensure the genetic diversity and survival of their progeny. Chromosomes may exist as either duplicated or unduplicated. Unduplicated chromosomes are single linear strands, whereas duplicated chromosomes contain two identical copies (called chromatids or sister chromatids) joined by a centromere.
Compaction of the duplicated chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis results in the classic four-arm structure (pictured to the right) if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends. Chromosomal recombination plays a vital role in genetic diversity. If these structures are manipulated incorrectly, through processes known as chromosomal instability and translocation, the cell may undergo mitotic catastrophe and die, or it may unexpectedly evade apoptosis leading to the progression of cancer.
In practice "chromosome" is a rather loosely defined term. In prokaryotes and viruses, the term genophore is more appropriate when no chromatin is present. However, a large body of work uses the term chromosome regardless of chromatin content. In prokaryotes, DNA is usually arranged as a loop, which is tightly coiled in on itself, sometimes accompanied by one or more smaller, circular DNA molecules called plasmids. These small circular genomes are also found in mitochondria and chloroplasts, reflecting their bacterial origins. The simplest genophores are found in viruses: these DNA or RNA molecules are short linear or circular genophores that often lack structural proteins.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl][tpl]explain[/tpl]
The word chromosome comes from the Greek [tpl]lang|grc|χρῶμα[/tpl] (chroma, colour) and [tpl]lang|grc|σῶμα[/tpl] (soma, body) due to their property of being very strongly stained by particular dyes.

==History of discovery==

In a series of experiments beginning in the mid-1880s, Theodor Boveri gave the definitive demonstration that chromosomes are the vectors of heredity. His two principles were the continuity of chromosomes and the individuality of chromosomes.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl][tpl]explain[/tpl] It is the second of these principles that was so original.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl] Wilhelm Roux suggested that each chromosome carries a different genetic load. Boveri was able to test and confirm this hypothesis. Aided by the rediscovery at the start of the 1900s of Gregor Mendel's earlier work, Boveri was able to point out the connection between the rules of inheritance and the behaviour of the chromosomes. Boveri influenced two generations of American cytologists: Edmund Beecher Wilson, Walter Sutton and Theophilus Painter were all influenced by Boveri (Wilson and Painter actually worked with him).
In his famous textbook The Cell in Development and Heredity, Wilson linked together the independent work of Boveri and Sutton (both around 1902) by naming the chromosome theory of inheritance the Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory (the names are sometimes reversed).Wilson, E.B. (1925). The Cell in Development and Heredity, Ed. 3. Macmillan, New York. p. 923. Ernst Mayr remarks that the theory was hotly contested by some famous geneticists: William Bateson, Wilhelm Johannsen, Richard Goldschmidt and T.H. Morgan, all of a rather dogmatic turn of mind. Eventually, complete proof came from chromosome maps in Morgan's own lab.Mayr, E. (1982). The growth of biological thought. Harvard. p. 749.
The number of human chromosomes was published in 1923 by Theophilus Painter. By inspection through the microscope he counted 24. Surprisingly, his error was copied by others and it was not until 1956 that the true number, 23, was determined.[ref]

==Prokaryotes==

The prokaryotes – bacteria and archaea – typically have a single circular chromosome, but many variations exist.[tpl]cite journal|author=Thanbichler M, Shapiro L|title=Chromosome organization and segregation in bacteria|journal=J. Struct. Biol.|volume=156|issue=2|pages=292–303|year=2006|pmid=16860572|doi= 10.1016/j.jsb.2006.05.007[/tpl] Most bacteria's chromosome can range in size from only 160,000 base pairs in the endosymbiotic bacterium Candidatus Carsonella ruddii,[tpl]cite journal|author=Nakabachi A, Yamashita A, Toh H, Ishikawa H, Dunbar H, Moran N, Hattori M|title=The 160-kilobase genome of the bacterial endosymbiont Carsonella|journal=Science|volume=314|issue=5797|pages=267|year=2006|pmid=17038615|doi=10.1126/science.1134196[/tpl] to 12,200,000 base pairs in the soil-dwelling bacterium Sorangium cellulosum.[tpl]cite journal|author=Pradella S, Hans A, Spröer C, Reichenbach H, Gerth K, Beyer S|title=Characterisation, genome size and genetic manipulation of the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum So ce56|journal=Arch Microbiol|volume=178|issue=6|pages=484–92|year=2002|pmid=12420170|doi= 10.1007/s00203-002-0479-2[/tpl] Spirochaetes of the genus Borrelia are a notable exception to this arrangement, with bacteria such as Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease, containing a single linear chromosome.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hinnebusch J, Tilly K|title=Linear plasmids and chromosomes in bacteria|journal=Mol Microbiol|volume=10|issue=5 |pages=917–22 |year=1993|pmid = 7934868 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.1993.tb00963.x[/tpl] Some genes, known as Orphons, aren't even in a chromosome at all.

===Structure in sequences===

Prokaryotic chromosomes have less sequence-based structure than eukaryotes. Bacteria typically have a single point (the origin of replication) from which replication starts, whereas some archaea contain multiple replication origins.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kelman LM, Kelman Z|title=Multiple origins of replication in archaea|journal=Trends Microbiol.|volume=12|issue=9|pages= 399–401|year=2004|pmid=15337158|doi=10.1016/j.tim.2004.07.001[/tpl] The genes in prokaryotes are often organized in operons, and do not usually contain introns, unlike eukaryotes.

===DNA packaging===

Prokaryotes do not possess nuclei. Instead, their DNA is organized into a structure called the nucleoid.[tpl]cite journal|author=Thanbichler M, Wang SC, Shapiro L|title=The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure|journal= J. Cell. Biochem.|volume=96|issue=3|pages=506–21|year=2005|pmid=15988757|doi=10.1002/jcb.20519[/tpl] The nucleoid is a distinct structure and occupies a defined region of the bacterial cell. This structure is, however, dynamic and is maintained and remodeled by the actions of a range of histone-like proteins, which associate with the bacterial chromosome.[tpl]cite journal|author= Sandman K, Pereira SL, Reeve JN|title=Diversity of prokaryotic chromosomal proteins and the origin of the nucleosome|journal=Cell. Mol. Life Sci.|volume=54|issue=12|pages=1350–64|year=1998|pmid=9893710|doi=10.1007/s000180050259[/tpl] In archaea, the DNA in chromosomes is even more organized, with the DNA packaged within structures similar to eukaryotic nucleosomes.[tpl]cite journal|author=Sandman K, Reeve JN|title=Structure and functional relationships of archaeal and eukaryal histones and nucleosomes| doi=10.1007/s002039900122|journal=Arch.

Bacterial chromosomes tend to be tethered to the plasma membrane of the bacteria. In molecular biology application, this allows for its isolation from plasmid DNA by centrifugation of lysed bacteria and pelleting of the membranes (and the attached DNA).
Prokaryotic chromosomes and plasmids are, like eukaryotic DNA, generally supercoiled. The DNA must first be released into its relaxed state for access for transcription, regulation, and replication.

==Eukaryotes==

Eukaryotes (cells with nuclei such as those found in plants, yeast, and animals) possess multiple large linear chromosomes contained in the cell's nucleus. Each chromosome has one centromere, with one or two arms projecting from the centromere, although, under most circumstances, these arms are not visible as such. In addition, most eukaryotes have a small circular mitochondrial genome, and some eukaryotes may have additional small circular or linear cytoplasmic chromosomes.
In the nuclear chromosomes of eukaryotes, the uncondensed DNA exists in a semi-ordered structure, where it is wrapped around histones (structural proteins), forming a composite material called chromatin.

===Chromatin===

Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein found in the eukaryotic nucleus, which packages chromosomes. The structure of chromatin varies significantly between different stages of the cell cycle, according to the requirements of the DNA.

====Interphase chromatin====

During interphase (the period of the cell cycle where the cell is not dividing), two types of chromatin can be distinguished:

====Metaphase chromatin and division====

In the early stages of mitosis or meiosis (cell division), the chromatin strands become more and more condensed. They cease to function as accessible genetic material (transcription stops) and become a compact transportable form. This compact form makes the individual chromosomes visible, and they form the classic four arm structure, a pair of sister chromatids attached to each other at the centromere. The shorter arms are called p arms (from the French petit, small) and the longer arms are called q arms (q follows p in the Latin alphabet; q-g "grande"; alternatively it is sometimes said q is short for queue meaning tail in French"Chromosome Mapping: Idiograms" Nature Education - August 13, 2013). This is the only natural context in which individual chromosomes are visible with an optical microscope.
During mitosis, microtubules grow from centrosomes located at opposite ends of the cell and also attach to the centromere at specialized structures called kinetochores, one of which is present on each sister chromatid. A special DNA base sequence in the region of the kinetochores provides, along with special proteins, longer-lasting attachment in this region. The microtubules then pull the chromatids apart toward the centrosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromatids. Once the cells have divided, the chromatids are uncoiled and DNA can again be transcribed. In spite of their appearance, chromosomes are structurally highly condensed, which enables these giant DNA structures to be contained within a cell nucleus (Fig. 2).

===Human chromosomes===

Chromosomes in humans can be divided into two types: autosomes and sex chromosomes. Certain genetic traits are linked to a person's sex and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic hereditary information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the mitochondrial genome. Sequencing of the human genome has provided a great deal of information about each of the chromosomes. Below is a table compiling statistics for the chromosomes, based on the Sanger Institute's human genome information in the Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA) database.Vega.sanger.ad.uk, all data in this table was derived from this database, November 11, 2008. Number of genes is an estimate as it is in part based on gene predictions. Total chromosome length is an estimate as well, based on the estimated size of unsequenced heterochromatin regions.

==Number of chromosomes in various organisms==

===Eukaryotes===

These tables give the total number of chromosomes (including sex chromosomes) in a cell nucleus. For example, human cells are diploid and have 22 different types of autosome, each present as two copies, and two sex chromosomes. This gives 46 chromosomes in total. Other organisms have more than two copies of their chromosomes, such as bread wheat, which is hexaploid and has six copies of seven different chromosomes – 42 chromosomes in total.

Normal members of a particular eukaryotic species all have the same number of nuclear chromosomes (see the table). Other eukaryotic chromosomes, i.e., mitochondrial and plasmid-like small chromosomes, are much more variable in number, and there may be thousands of copies per cell.
Asexually reproducing species have one set of chromosomes, which are the same in all body cells. However, asexual species can be either haploid or diploid.
Sexually reproducing species have somatic cells (body cells), which are diploid 2n having two sets of chromosomes (23 pairs in humans with one set of 23 chromosomes from each parent), one set from the mother and one from the father. Gametes, reproductive cells, are haploid n: They have one set of chromosomes. Gametes are produced by meiosis of a diploid germ line cell. During meiosis, the matching chromosomes of father and mother can exchange small parts of themselves (crossover), and thus create new chromosomes that are not inherited solely from either parent. When a male and a female gamete merge (fertilization), a new diploid organism is formed.
Some animal and plant species are polyploid Xn: They have more than two sets of homologous chromosomes. Plants important in agriculture such as tobacco or wheat are often polyploid, compared to their ancestral species. Wheat has a haploid number of seven chromosomes, still seen in some cultivars as well as the wild progenitors. The more-common pasta and bread wheats are polyploid, having 28 (tetraploid) and 42 (hexaploid) chromosomes, compared to the 14 (diploid) chromosomes in the wild wheat.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Sakamura |first1=Tetsu |year=1918 |title= Kurze Mitteilung über die Chromosomenzahlen und die Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse der Triticum-Arten |journal= Shokubutsugaku Zasshi |volume=32 |issue=379 |pages=150–3 |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jplantres1887/32/379/32_379_150/_article[/tpl]

===Prokaryotes===

Prokaryote species generally have one copy of each major chromosome, but most cells can easily survive with multiple copies.Charlebois R.L. (ed) 1999. Organization of the prokaryote genome. ASM Press, Washington DC. For example, Buchnera, a symbiont of aphids has multiple copies of its chromosome, ranging from 10–400 copies per cell.[tpl]cite journal |author=Komaki K, Ishikawa H |title=Genomic copy number of intracellular bacterial symbionts of aphids varies in response to developmental stage and morph of their host |journal=Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=253–8 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10732993 |doi=10.1016/S0965-1748(99)00125-3[/tpl] However, in some large bacteria, such as Epulopiscium fishelsoni up to 100,000 copies of the chromosome can be present.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mendell JE, Clements KD, Choat JH, Angert ER |title=Extreme polyploidy in a large bacterium |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=105 |issue=18 |pages=6730–4 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18445653 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0707522105 |pmc=2373351[/tpl] Plasmids and plasmid-like small chromosomes are, as in eukaryotes, highly variable in copy number. The number of plasmids in the cell is almost entirely determined by the rate of division of the plasmid – fast division causes high copy number.

==Karyotype==

In general, the karyotype is the characteristic chromosome complement of a eukaryote species.[tpl]cite book |author=White, M. J. D. |title=The chromosomes |publisher=Chapman and Hall, distributed by Halsted Press, New York |location=London |year=1973 |pages=28 |isbn=0-412-11930-7 |edition=6th[/tpl] The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics.
Although the replication and transcription of DNA is highly standardized in eukaryotes, the same cannot be said for their karyotypes, which are often highly variable. There may be variation between species in chromosome number and in detailed organization.
In some cases, there is significant variation within species. Often there is:
Also, variation in karyotype may occur during development from the fertilised egg.
The technique of determining the karyotype is usually called karyotyping. Cells can be locked part-way through division (in metaphase) in vitro (in a reaction vial) with colchicine. These cells are then stained, photographed, and arranged into a karyogram, with the set of chromosomes arranged, autosomes in order of length, and sex chromosomes (here X/Y) at the end: Fig. 3.
Like many sexually reproducing species, humans have special gonosomes (sex chromosomes, in contrast to autosomes). These are XX in females and XY in males. 

===Historical note===

Investigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question: How many chromosomes does a normal diploid human cell contain? In 1912, Hans von Winiwarter reported 47 chromosomes in spermatogonia and 48 in oogonia, concluding an XX/XO sex determination mechanism.[tpl]cite journal |author=von Winiwarter H |title=Études sur la spermatogenese humaine |journal=Arch. Biologie |volume=27 |issue=93 |pages=147–9 |year=1912[/tpl] Painter in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid number of man is 46 or 48, at first favouring 46.[tpl]cite journal |author=Painter TS |title=The spermatogenesis of man |journal=Anat. Res. |volume=23 |issue= |pages=129 |year=1922[/tpl] He revised his opinion later from 46 to 48, and he correctly insisted on humans having an XX/XY system.[tpl]cite journal |author=Painter TS |title=Studies in mammalian spermatogenesis II. The spermatogenesis of man |journal=J. Exp. Zoology |volume=37 |issue= 3|pages=291–336 |year=1923 |doi=10.1002/jez.1400370303[/tpl]
New techniques were needed to definitively solve the problem:
It took until 1954 before the human diploid number was confirmed as 46.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1601-5223.1956.tb03010.x |author=Tjio JH, Levan A |title=The chromosome number of man |journal=Hereditas |volume=42 |issue= |pages=1–6 |year=1956[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Ford C.E, Hamerton J.L|title=The Chromosomes of Man|journal=Nature|volume=178|pages=1020–1023|year=1956|doi=10.1038/1781020a0|pmid=13378517|issue=4541[/tpl] Considering the techniques of Winiwarter and Painter, their results were quite remarkable.Hsu T.C. Human and mammalian cytogenetics: a historical perspective. Springer-Verlag, N.Y. p10: "It's amazing that he Painter even came close!" Chimpanzees (the closest living relatives to modern humans) have 48 chromosomes (as well as the other great apes: in humans two chromosomes fused to form chromosome 2).

==Aberrations==

Chromosomal aberrations are disruptions in the normal chromosomal content of a cell and are a major cause of genetic conditions in humans, such as Down syndrome, although most aberrations have little to no effect. Some chromosome abnormalities do not cause disease in carriers, such as translocations, or chromosomal inversions, although they may lead to a higher chance of bearing a child with a chromosome disorder. Abnormal numbers of chromosomes or chromosome sets, called aneuploidy, may be lethal or may give rise to genetic disorders. Genetic counseling is offered for families that may carry a chromosome rearrangement.
The gain or loss of DNA from chromosomes can lead to a variety of genetic disorders. Human examples include:
