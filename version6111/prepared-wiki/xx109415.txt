==Brewpubs==

Goose Island has two brewpubs which both serve brunch, lunch, and dinner. The Clybourn location has specialty food items, such as duck, rabbit, and truffle aioli served with French fries. They serve anything from a burger and fries to homemade sausages and PEI Mussels. The Wrigleyville location serves mostly pub food like burgers and chicken. The brewpubs are supplied by local farmers who raise natural meats; many of the animals are fed the same wheat and grain that was previously used to make the beer, as one sign reads "Beer Fed Pork Served Here."
The Goose Island brewpubs were not a part of the sale of Goose Island Beer Company to Anheuser Busch.[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.gooseisland.com/pages/press_release_03_28_2011/215.php |title=Press Release 03.28.2011: Goose Island Selects Current Partner Anheuser-Bush for Growth Strategy |date=March 28, 2011 |location=Chicago, Illinois |accessdate=July 14, 2012[/tpl]
