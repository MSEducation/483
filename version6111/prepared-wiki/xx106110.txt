[[Symphony No. 4 (Vaughan Williams)]]

CATEGORIES: 1935 compositions, Symphonies by Ralph Vaughan Williams, Compositions in F minor

The Symphony No. 4 in F minor by Ralph Vaughan Williams was dedicated by the composer to Arnold Bax.
Unlike Vaughan Williams's first three symphonies it was not given a title, the composer stating that it was to be understood as pure music, without any incidental or external inspiration. 
In contrast to many of Vaughan Williams's previous compositions, the symphony displays a severity of tone. The composer himself once observed of it, "I'm not at all sure that I like it myself now. All I know is that it's what I wanted to do at the time." The British composer Sir William Walton admired the work greatly, speaking of it as "the greatest symphony since Beethoven". Only two symphonies of Vaughan Williams end loudly, No.4 and No.8.
The work was first performed on 10 April 1935 by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Adrian Boult.  Its first recording, made two years later, featured the composer himself conducting the same orchestra in what proved to be his only commercial recording of any of his symphonies. It was released on 78-rpm discs in the U.K. by HMV and in the U.S. by RCA Victor, and has been reissued on LP and CD.Vaughan Williams conducts Vaughan Williams Amazon website. Retrieved 2011-07-10.

The earliest American performance to have survived in recorded form was the broadcast of 14 March 1943 by the  NBC Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski.

The Fourth is the only Vaughan Williams symphony to have received as many recordings by non-British conductors as by British ones. The list of the former includes Dimitri Mitropoulos and Leonard Bernstein, both with the New York Philharmonic. It was also recorded by André Previn, Leonard Slatkin, Paavo Berglund and Bernard Haitink. British conductors who have recorded the work—in addition to the composer himself—include Sir Adrian Boult, Vernon Handley, Paul Daniel, Richard Hickox and Sir Andrew Davis, as well as Leopold Stokowski in the 'live' war-time broadcast referred to above.
In 2011, the Oregon Symphony performed and recorded the composition for Music for a Time of War.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/music-for-a-time-of-war-mw0002216825|title=Music for a Time of War|accessdate=November 13, 2012|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation[/tpl]
