[[Picolaton]]

CATEGORIES: French mythology, Mythological birds

The picolaton (also known as the pique-au-mollet, quiperlibresson and cacalambri) is an imaginary bird present in the folklore of Franche-Comté.
It is best known as a creature used to threaten lazy children, by saying that the picolaton would nip their heels and buttocks if they did not hurry. It is thus akin to the bogeyman. Particularly irritating children are promised a visit to the incredible nest of the fabulous bird around April Fool's Day, provided they are very good and obedient.[tpl]cite book | language= French  | author=Brasey, Édouard | title=La Petite Encyclopédie du merveilleux| edition=Éditions le pré aux clercs|location =Paris |date=14 September 2007| |page=277|isbn=978-2842283216[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Revue des traditions populaires|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wwooAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA315|accessdate=13 August 2013|year=1908|publisher=École typographique des pupilles de la Seine|page=315[/tpl] It supposedly nests in thorn bushes.[tpl]cite book|author=Société d'émulation de Montbéliard|title=Mémoires|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=imhMAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA313|accessdate=13 August 2013|year=1897|page=313[/tpl]
