[[Ethnic elite]]

CATEGORIES: Ethnicity

An ethnic elite refers to an ethnic group which in a local context has gained a position of economic and power over that of other groups. Ethnic elites may also foster ideologies and beliefs which serve to sustain their relative power.
The ethnic elite may be divided in two basic ways â€” either an 'elite ethnic majority' or an 'elite ethnic minority.' The term market dominant minority has also been used.
