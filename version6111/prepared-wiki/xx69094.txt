Lincoln Davenport Chafee ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|eɪ|f|iː[/tpl]; born March 26, 1953) is an American politician who has been the 74th Governor of Rhode Island since January 2011. Prior to his election as governor, Chafee served in the United States Senate as a Republican from 1999 until losing his Senate re-election bid in 2006 to Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse. In 2007, he left the Republican Party and became an independent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/CHAFEE_GOP_09-16-07_DP751KF.31dd3fe.html |title=Chafee quietly quits the GOP |publisher=Projo.com |date=September 16, 2007 |archivedate=September 19, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070919175817/http://www.projo.com/news/content/CHAFEE_GOP_09-16-07_DP751KF.31dd3fe.html |accessdate=March 9, 2013[/tpl] He is the first independent to serve as Governor of Rhode Island since John Collins, who served 1786–1790.

A Rhode Island native educated at Phillips Academy and Brown University, Chafee worked as a professional farrier for seven years before entering state politics in 1985. He was a delegate to the Rhode Island State Constitutional Convention, a member of the Warwick, Rhode Island city council, and later the mayor of Warwick. Chafee was appointed to the United States Senate in 1999 upon the death of his father, Senator John Chafee, and was elected in the 2000 Senate election for a full six-year term.
Chafee was a supporter of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential bid and was a co-chair of Obama's re-election campaign. On January 4, 2010, Chafee declared his intent to run for Governor of Rhode Island.http://www.projo.com/news/efitzpatrick/edward_fitzpatrick_5_01-05-10_9JH0FGE_v16.3014a12.html Prior to entering the gubernatorial race, he was a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at Brown University's Watson Institute for International Studies.

==Early life, education, and racing career==

Chafee was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the son of Virginia (née Coates) and John Chafee. He attended public schools in Warwick, Rhode Island, Providence Country Day School, and Phillips Academy.  At Brown University, Chafee captained the wrestling team, and in 1975 earned a Bachelor of Arts in Classics. He then attended the Montana State University horseshoeing school in Bozeman. For the next seven years, he worked as a farrier at harness racetracks in the United States and Canada. One of the horses he shod, Overburden, set the track record at Northlands Park in Edmonton, Alberta.

==Local politics (1985–1999)==

Chafee entered politics in 1985 as a delegate to the Rhode Island Constitutional Convention. A year later, he was elected to the Warwick City Council, where he served until his election as Warwick's mayor in 1992, a post he held until his 1999 appointment to the U.S. Senate.

==United States Senate (1999–2007)==

===Tenure===

After his father announced he would not seek re-election in 2000, Lincoln Chafee announced he would run for the seat.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/13/AR2006041301917.html |work=The Washington Post |title=A Republican on the Edge |first=Shailagh |last=Murray |date=April 14, 2006 |accessdate=May 7, 2010[/tpl] When John Chafee died suddenly in October 1999, Governor Lincoln Almond appointed the younger Chafee to serve out the term.
Chafee's liberal stances as a Republican led to some conservatives to refer to him as a "Republican In Name Only", or RINO. Most notable among these was Human Events magazine, which named Chafee "the No. 1 RINO in the country."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/sarticle.php?id=11129 |title=Human Events |work=Human Events |date=December 27, 2005 |accessdate=November 3, 2010[/tpl] The National Journal has rated Chafee as The Least Conservative Republican in the Senate, and placed him to the left of two Democrats, Nebraska's Ben Nelson and Louisiana's Mary Landrieu (the only Republican ranked to the left of the latter senator).[tpl]dead link|date=November 2010[/tpl]
Known for often disagreeing with the Republican Party leadership, Chafee says he did not cast his ballot for President George W. Bush in the 2004 election, instead choosing to write in former president George H. W. Bush as a nod to the Republican Party of his father.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ramcigar.com/media/paper366/news/2004/10/05/News/Chafee.Speaks.With.Students.About.Election-741669.shtml |title=The Good 5 Cent Cigar |publisher=Ramcigar.com |accessdate=November 3, 2010[/tpl] Chafee frequently criticized the younger Bush's record on the environment, and expressed concern about the 2004 Republican platform and overall philosophical direction of the party. He described the younger Bush's presidency as "an agenda of energizing the far-right-wing base, which is divisive."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/ussenate/2004-11-03-ri-chaffee_x.htm# |work=USA Today |title=Sen.

Bush for re-nomination in the New Hampshire primary in 2004 on an anti- (Iraq and Afghanistan) war platform. In his autobiography, Against the Tide (2007), he states that "In the fall of 2003, part of me thought it was cowardly to oppose the president on so many issues and then not oppose him head-on as he sought renomination." However, he decided not to run after the capture of Saddam Hussein on December 13, 2003.Lincoln Chafee, Against the Tide (2007), p.119-120

====Fiscal policy====

Chafee opposes eliminating the federal estate tax. Chafee also voted against both the 2001 and 2003 congressional budget bills that cut and/or rebated individuals' federal income taxes. He pointed out that tax cuts reduce revenue to the federal government, thereby worsening the federal budget deficit and increasing the amount of money it has to borrow in order to operate.
On November 17, 2005, he was the only Republican to vote in favor of reinstating the top federal income tax rate of 39.6% (which last existed under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s) on the highest-income taxpayers.
Chafee was one of the few Republicans to vote against allowing drilling in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and was a member of the Republicans for Environmental Protection. He has been endorsed throughout his career by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters.
Chafee favors increased federal funding for health care, and supports an increase in the federal minimum wage. In 2003, Chafee voted against the Medicare Part D prescription drug expansion. However, Chafee also cast a crucial procedural vote against a Democratic attempt to kill that bill, which failed by only two votes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/mcharlesbakst/projo_20031202_mcbcol02.116926.html |title=Providence | Local News | M. Charles Bakst |publisher=Projo.com |date=December 2, 2003 |accessdate=November 3, 2010[/tpl] Chafee also co-sponsored the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, which expanded federal jurisdiction over class-action lawsuits, and voted against a wholesale ban on gifts from employees of lobbying companies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/SenateVote/Party_2006-080.htm |title=Senate Votes on 2006-080 |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date=March 29, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2010[/tpl]
Some Chafee's positions considered to be within the mainstream of the current Republican Party include his support of free trade agreements (e.g., North American Free Trade Agreement and Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA);[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Lincoln_Chafee.htm |title=Lincoln Chafee for Senate: Issues2000.org |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date=February 12, 2000 |accessdate=November 3, 2010[/tpl] Bankruptcy Reform; the partial privatization of Social Security;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Economic/Lincoln_Chafee_Social_Security.htm |title=Lincoln Chafee on Social Security |publisher=Ontheissues.org |accessdate=November 3, 2010[/tpl] and the USA Patriot Act.

====Social policy====

Chafee was a member of the Republican Majority for Choice and Republicans for Choice. Chafee was also a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership
Chafee is pro-choice.Lincoln Chafee on Abortion OnTheIssues.org In 2003, Chafee was one of the three Republican Senators to oppose the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. His 2005 senatorial re-election bid was endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice America. He also supported federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.
Chafee is a supporter and was one of three Republican senators to come out for same-sex marriage.
He supports affirmative action and gun control, and was one of only two Republicans to vote against the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (which prevents firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable for crimes committed with their products. On June 27, 2006, Chafee was one of only three Republicans to vote against the proposed Flag Desecration Amendment.
Chafee opposes the death penalty, and has consistently voted against limiting death penalty appeals in federal cases. He has also favored including racial statistics in death penalty appeals, and making DNA analysis a prerequisite for any federal-level, criminal executions.
On May 23, 2005, Chafee was one of 14 bipartisan senators to forge a compromise on the Democrats' use of the judicial filibuster, forestalling the Republican leadership's implementation of the so-called "nuclear option". Under the agreement, the Democrats would retain the power to filibuster a Bush II judicial nominee only in an "extraordinary circumstance", and three of the most conservative Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor) would receive a vote by the full Senate. Chafee was the only Republican to oppose George W. Bush's nomination of Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court. However, he voted to end debate on the nomination, helping to end any chance of a Democratic filibuster of it.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode_island/articles/2006/01/30/chafee_says_he_will_vote_against_alito/ |title=Chafee says he will vote against Alito |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Chafee did not announce his opposition to the nomination until a majority of Senators had already publicly said they would support Alito.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,183204,00.html |publisher=Fox News |title=Alito Filibuster Fails, Confirmation Vote Expected Tuesday |date=January 31, 2006[/tpl]

====Foreign policy====

Chafee was the only Republican in the Senate to have voted against authorization of the use of force in Iraq. On June 22, 2006, he was the only Republican to vote for the Levin amendment calling for a nonbinding timetable for a withdrawal of US troops from Iraq.[tpl]cite web|title=Roll Call|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&vote=00182|publisher=Senate|accessdate=May 15, 2012[/tpl] Chafee voted against the Kerry-Feingold amendment calling for a binding timetable.
Chafee is now involved in the J Street project, a liberal Jewish group that calls for Israel to withdraw from all occupied territories and advocates for a "two state" solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict.
In November 2006, immediately following the midterm elections, Chafee joined key Democrats in opposing President Bush's renomination of John Bolton as United States Ambassador to the United Nations. On December 4, 2006, the White House announced that Bolton would no longer seek the appointment, and would resign within a matter of weeks.

===Committee assignments===

===Elections===

He was elected to a full six-year term in 2000, defeating Democratic candidate then-U.S. Representative Robert Weygand by a 57%–41% in the heavily Democratic state.
In September 2005, Steve Laffey, the mayor of Cranston, Rhode Island, announced his intention to run against Chafee in the Republican primary election. Among other stances differing from those of Chafee, Mayor Laffey opposed abortion and stem cell research. Laffey was supported by notable conservative groups including the Club for Growth and several Ohio-based anti-abortion groups. Chafee went on to defeat Laffey in the primary on September 12 by a margin of 53%-47%, an unusually close margin for an incumbent Senator. The turnout for the Republican primary was the largest in Rhode Island history. In his victory speech, Chafee credited independent voters and disaffiliated Democrats for his victory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/extra/election/content/projo_20060913_newgop.37563ed.html |title=Extra: Election |work=The Providence Journal |date=September 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2010[/tpl]
Despite Chafee's high approval ratings statewide, the state had tended to lean heavily toward socially liberal or moderate candidates for many decades. As a result, Whitehouse succeeded by attacking the instances in which Chafee supported his party's conservative congressional leadership (whose personalities and policies were very unpopular, state-wide).
Chafee was defeated by Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse in the general election, 54%-46%. In response to a question at a news conference on November 9, 2006, Chafee stated he was unsure whether he would remain in the Republican Party after serving out the remainder of his term. According to Michelle R. Smith of the Associated Press, when asked whether he felt that his loss may have helped the country by switching control of power in Congress (toward liberal Democrats and away from conservative Republicans), he replied: "To be honest, yes."[tpl]cite news|last=Smith|first=Michelle|title=Chafee unsure of staying with GOP after losing election|url=http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=102x2606946|accessdate=May 28, 2012|newspaper=Associated Press|date=November 6, 2006[/tpl]

==Political hiatus (2007–2009)==

In December 2006, Chafee announced he was accepting a fellowship to serve as a "distinguished visiting fellow" at Brown University's Thomas J. Watson Jr. Institute for International Studies. The university had Chafee lead a student group studying U.S. foreign policy.Chafee takes fellowship at Brown. December 15, 2006, Providence Journal. Retrieved September 17, 2007.
In the September 2007, Chafee officially left the Republican Party, changing his affiliation to Independent. He said that he did so because of the Republicans' increasing conservatism, and particularly cited their reductions in funding to programs assisting middle- and low-income citizens (e.g., Pell Grants and Head Start).Former RI Sen.

On September 16, 2010, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (who had also switched from Republican to Independent in recent years) traveled to Rhode Island.

==Governor of Rhode Island (2011–present)==

===Activism===

In November 2011, it was reported that Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, the Chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, had asked Chafee to join the Democratic Party.  When asked if he was considering it, Chafee responded, "I’m happy where I am for now."[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.wpri.com/2011/11/29/democratic-governors-chief-woos-chafee-to-join-their-ranks/|title=Democratic governors’ chief woos Chafee to join Obama’s party|publisher=WPRI|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=November 29, 2011[/tpl]

===Fiscal issues===

A 2012 Poll showed that some of Chafee's proposed tax increases, intended to move the state from budget deficit to surplus status, had received negative feedback from Rhode Island residents. The majority of constituents opposed Chafee's proposed increase in driver's license and registration fees (67.5 percent), restoring tolls on the Sakonnet River bridge (57 percent), and raising the restaurant meals-and-beverage tax by two cents (80.3 percent).[tpl]cite news|last=Armental|first=Maria|title=Poll: R.I.

===Social issues===

On December 20, 2010, Chafee's spokesman Michael Trainor told Providence Journal that Chafee would skip Episcopalian services on January 4, 2011, to be at home with his family. Trainor elaborated, saying: "His point of view is that his Inauguration Day needs to respect the separation of church and state. Separation of church and state is an important constitutional principle."
In May 2012, Chafee resisted turning over a case to the U.S. Supreme Court due to his views on the death penalty. In regards to the case, which would likely result in a capital punishment ruling, Chafee said: "The State of Rhode Island must seek to protect both the strong states' rights issues at stake, and the legitimacy of its longstanding public policy against the death penalty."[tpl]cite news|last=Rivoli|first=Dan|title=Death Penalty Causes State-Fed Clash Over Accused Murderer In Rhode Island|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/340231/20120511/lincoln-chafee-rhode-island-death-penalty.htm|accessdate=May 28, 2012|newspaper=Business & Law|date=May 11, 2012[/tpl]

Chafee has shown some willingness to deviate from strict "War on Drugs" policies, in favor of alternative approaches to America's drug-crime problem.Nadelmann, Ethan (December 27, 2010) Breaking the Taboo, The Nation

===Education===

On "education reform" in general, Chafee does not believe the politically and publicly popular presumption that America's schools are failing, saying:
 This notion of all these failing schools, if this were true, how did America get to be at the status where we are in the world if it were that bad? So I don’t buy into the trashing of our public school system. Somehow Brown University, and University of Rhode Island and Bryant University, Providence College are full of public school students that are doing very, very well and leading America in many fields. Yes, there's room for improvement, I don't deny that and I want to be part of the improvement. But the notion that our public school systems are in disarray and failing, I don't buy that. 
Chafee opposes charter schools, saying, "I am wary of charter schools undermining and cherry picking and skimming off the top of our public school system."[tpl]cite web|author=on September 24, 2010  |url=http://rifuture.org/interview-lincoln-chafee-on-jobs-the-riedc-race-to-the-top-and-more.html|title=Lincoln Chafee on Jobs, the RIEDC, Race to the Top and More|publisher=Rifuture.org|date=September 24, 2010|accessdate=November 3, 2010[/tpl]
Chafee is "wary" of Race to the Top, "because Race to the Top includes money for charter schools". He says he would ask federal officials "what kind of flexibility we might have" to alter Race to the Top, were he elected Governor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/candidates_on_gist_09-28-10_FFK3HIM_v59.230cd9a.html|title=3 of 4 candidates for R.I. governor back Gist, Race to the Top, Providence Journal, September 28, 2010|publisher=Projo.com|date=September 28, 2010|accessdate=November 3, 2010[/tpl]

===Christmas controversy===

In 2012, for the second Christmas in a row, Chafee stirred up controversy during the annual Christmas tree lighting at the Rhode Island Statehouse when he called the towering fir, decorated with Christmas lights, tinsel and toys, a "holiday tree," insisting that "I’m representing all of Rhode Island, I have to be respectful of everyone.”[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/30/nation/la-na-nn-tree-lighting-20121130 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Tina | last=Susman | title='Christmas tree or holiday tree?' issue haunts R.I. lighting ceremony | date=November 30, 2012[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Chafee and his wife, Stephanie D. Chafee, have three children: Louisa, Caleb and Thea.
Chafee's great-great-grandfather, Henry Lippitt, was Governor of Rhode Island. Among his great-great-uncles are Rhode Island Governor Charles Warren Lippitt and United States Senator Henry Frederick Lippitt. His great-uncle, Zechariah Chafee, was a Harvard law professor and a notable civil libertarian. The Chafee family was among the earliest settlers of Hingham, Massachusetts, before moving south to Rhode Island.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cFc5AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA4&dq=%22daniel+cushing%22+hingham+clerk&lr=&ei=DdhJSYXxE5OeMqGA9fcM |title=The Chaffee Genealogy, William Henry Chaffee, 1635–1909, The Grafton Press, New York, 1909 |publisher=Google Books |date=September 2, 2000 |accessdate=November 3, 2010[/tpl]
