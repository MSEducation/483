The Mute Swan (Cygnus olor) is a species of swan, and thus a member of the waterfowl family Anatidae. It is native to much of Europe and Asia, and (as a rare winter visitor) the far north of Africa. It is also an introduced species in North America, Australasia and southern Africa. The name 'mute' derives from it being less vocal than other swan species.[tpl]cite book | editors = del Hoyo, J., et al.| title = Handbook of the Birds of the World|volume=1| publisher = Lynx Edicions| year = 1992 | location = Barcelona| pages = 577–78| isbn = 84-87334-10-5[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The Birds of the Western Palearctic |last=Snow |first=D.

==Taxonomy==

The Mute Swan was first formally described by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin as Anas olor in 1789, and was transferred by Johann Matthäus Bechstein to the new genus Cygnus in 1803. It is the type species of the genus Cygnus.[tpl]cite book | last = Cheng| first = Tso-hsin | title = A Synopsis of the Avifauna of China| publisher = Science Press| year = 1987 | location = Beijing| pages = 48–49 | isbn = 3-490-12518-5[/tpl] Both cygnus and olor mean "swan" in Latin; cygnus is related to the Greek kyknos.[tpl]cite book|authorlink=Henry George Liddell|last=Liddell|first=Henry George|authorlink2=Robert Scott (philologist)|last2= Scott|first2=Robert| year = 1980 | title = A Greek-English Lexicon |edition=Abridged| publisher = Oxford University Press | location = United Kingdom | isbn =0-19-910207-4[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Simpson | first = D.P. | title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary | publisher = Cassell | year = 1979 | edition = 5th | location = London | isbn = 0-304-52257-0[/tpl]
Despite its Eurasian origin, its closest relatives are the Black Swan of Australia and the Black-necked Swan of South America, not the other Northern Hemisphere swans. The species is monotypic with no living subspecies.

===Evolution===

Mute Swan subfossils, 6,000 years old, have been found in post-glacial peat beds of East Anglia, Great Britain.[tpl]cite journal |last=Northcote |first=E.M.|year=1981|title= Size difference between limb bones of recent and subfossil Mute Swans (Cygnus olor) |journal= J.

Young birds, called cygnets, are not the bright white of mature adults, and their bill is dull greyish-black, not orange, for the first year. The down may range from pure white to grey to buff, with grey/buff the most common. The white cygnets have a leucistic gene. All Mute Swans are white at maturity, though the feathers (particularly on the head and neck) are often stained orange-brown by iron and tannins in the water.[tpl]cite web|title=The Mute Swan [tpl]![/tpl] Birds of Eden|url=http://www.birdsofeden.co.za/index.php?comp=article&op=view&id=708|publisher=Birds of Eden|accessdate=26 March 2014[/tpl] 
The morph immutabilis ("Polish Swan") has pinkish (not dark grey) legs and dull white cygnets; as with white domestic geese, it is only found in populations with a history of domestication.[tpl]cite book |title=The Birds of the Western Palearctic |last=Cramp |first=S., chief editor | year=1977 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= Oxford|isbn= 0-19-857358-8[/tpl]

==Behaviour==

Mute Swans nest on large mounds that they build with waterside vegetation in shallow water on islands in the middle or at the very edge of a lake. They are monogamous and often reuse the same nest each year, restoring or rebuilding it as needed. Male and female swans share the care of the nest, and once the cygnets are fledged it is not uncommon to see whole families looking for food.They feed on a wide range of vegetation, both submerged aquatic plants which they reach with their long necks, and by grazing on land. The food commonly includes agricultural crop plants such as oilseed rape and wheat, and feeding flocks in the winter may cause significant crop damage, often as much through trampling with their large webbed feet, as through direct consumption.[tpl]cite journal|last=Parrott|first=D.|last2= McKay|first2=H. V. |year=2001|title= Mute swan grazing on winter crops: Estimation of yield loss in oilseed rape and wheat. Mute swans occasionally eat insects, amphibians and smaller birds|journal=J. Crop Protection|volume= 20|pages= 913–919[/tpl]
Unlike Black Swans, Mute Swans are usually strongly territorial with just a single pair on smaller lakes, though in a few locations where a large area of suitable feeding habitat is found they can be colonial. The largest colonies have over 100 pairs, such as at the colony at Abbotsbury Swannery in southern England, and at the southern tip of Öland Island, Ottenby Preserve, in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, and can have nests spaced as little as [tpl]Convert|2|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] apart.[tpl]cite book|author=Hogan, C. M.|title=Environmental Database for Oland, Sweden|publisher=Lumina Press|year=2006[/tpl] Non-mated juveniles up to 3–4 years old also commonly form larger flocks, which can total several hundred birds, often at regular traditional sites.[tpl]cite book|last=Scott|first= P. |coauthors= Wildfowl Trust|title=Behavioral patterns of juvenile Mute Swans|year=1972[/tpl] A notable flock of non-breeding birds is found on the River Tweed estuary at Berwick-upon-Tweed in northeastern England, with a maximum count of 787 birds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swan-trust.org/berwick_swans.htm|title= The Berwick Swan and Wildlife Trust[/tpl] Once the adults are mated they seek out their own territories and often live close to ducks and gulls, which may take advantage of the swan's ability to reach deep water weeds, which tend to spread out on the water surface.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
The Mute Swan is less vocal than the noisy Whooper and Bewick's Swans; they do, however, make a variety of grunting, hoarse whistling, and snorting noises, especially in communicating with their cygnets, and usually hiss at predators trying to enter their territory.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] The most familiar sound associated with Mute Swan is the vibrant throbbing of the wings in flight which is unique to the species, and can be heard from a range of [tpl]Convert|1|to|2|km|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=on[/tpl], indicating its value as a contact sound between birds in flight. 
Mute Swans can be very aggressive in defence of their nests. Most defensive attacks from a Mute Swan begin with a loud hiss and, if this is not sufficient to drive off the predator, are followed by a physical attack. Swans attack by smashing at their enemy with bony spurs in the wings, accompanied by biting with their large bill. The wings of the swan are very powerful, anecdotally reported to exert enough force to break an adult man's leg.http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/natbltn/600-699/nb616.htm Large waterfowl, such as Canada Geese, (more likely out of competition than in response to potential predation) may also be aggressively driven off, and Mute Swans regularly attack people who enter their territory. The cob is also responsible for defending the cygnets while on the water, and will sometimes attack small watercraft, such as canoes, that it feels are a threat to its young. The cob will additionally try and chase the predator out of his family territory, and will keep animals such as foxes and raptors at bay. In New York (outside its native range), the most common predators of cygnets are common snapping turtles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/7076.html |title=Mute Swan |publisher=New York Department of Environmental Conservation |accessdate=2012-05-03[/tpl] Healthy adults are rarely predated, though canids such as coyotes, felids such as lynxes, and bears can pose a threat to infirm ones (healthy adults can usually swim away from danger unless defending nests) and there are a few cases of healthy adults falling prey to Golden Eagles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Cygnus_olor.html |title=ADW: Cygnus olor: INFORMATION |publisher=Animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu |accessdate=2012-05-03[/tpl][tpl]cite book | author = Watson, Jeff |url = | title =The Golden Eagle: Second Edition | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-30017-019-1[/tpl]
The familiar pose with neck curved back and wings half raised, known as busking, is a threat display. Both feet are paddled in unison during this display, resulting in more jerky movement.[tpl]cite web|title=Topic: Busking|url=http://www.birdcare.com/bin/showdict?busking|publisher=Bird On!

==Distribution and habitat==

The Mute Swan is found naturally mainly in temperate areas of Europe across western Asia, as far east as the Russian Maritimes, near Sidemi.[tpl]cite book |title=Birds of the Soviet Union|volume= IV |last=Dement'ev |first=G.P. |first2 = N.A. |last2=Gladkov |year=1967 |publisher= U.S. Fish & Wildlife Translation |location= |isbn= |pages= [/tpl]
It is partially migratory throughout northern latitudes in Europe and Asia, as far south as north Africa and the Mediterranean. It is known and recorded to have nested in Iceland and is a vagrant to that area, as well as to Bermuda, according to the U.N. Environmental Programme chart of international status chart of bird species, which places it in 70 countries, breeding in 49 countries, and vagrant in 16 countries.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] While most of the current population in Japan is introduced, Mute Swans are depicted on scrolls more than a thousand years old, and wild birds from the mainland Asian population still occur rarely in winter. Natural migrants to Japan usually occur along with Whooper and sometimes Bewick's Swans.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
The Mute Swan is protected in most of its range, but this has not prevented illegal hunting and poaching. It is often kept in captivity outside its natural range, as a decoration for parks and ponds, and escapes have happened. The descendants of such birds have become naturalised in the eastern United States and Great Lakes, much as the Canada Goose has done in Europe.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

===World population===

====Native populations==== 
The total native population of Mute Swans is about 500,000 birds at the end of the breeding season (adults plus young), of which 350,000 are in the former Soviet Union. The largest single breeding concentration is 11,000 pairs in the Volga Delta.
The population in the United Kingdom is about 22,000 birds, as of the 2006–2007 winter,[tpl]cite book |title=Waterbirds in the UK 2006/07 |last=Austin |first= G. |coauthors = Collier, M.; Calbrade, N.; Hall, C.; & Musgrove, A.|year=2008 |publisher=Wetland Bird Survey|location= Thetford|isbn= 978-1-906204-33-4[/tpl] a slight decline from the peak of about 26,000-27,000 birds in 1990. This includes about 5,300 breeding pairs, the remainder being immatures.[tpl]cite journal |last=Baker |first=H.|year=2006|title= Population estimates of birds in Great Britain |journal= British Birds |volume=99|pages=25–44 |id= |display-authors=1 |author2= [/tpl] Other significant populations in Europe include 6,800-8,300 breeding pairs in Germany, 4,500 pairs in Denmark, 4,000-4,200 pairs in Poland, 3,000-4,000 pairs in the Netherlands, about 2,500 pairs in Ireland, and 1,200-1,700 pairs in Ukraine.
For many centuries, Mute Swans in Britain were domesticated for food, with individuals being marked by nicks on their webs (feet) or beaks to indicate ownership. These marks were registered with the Crown and a Royal Swanherd was appointed. Any birds not so marked became Crown property, hence the swan becoming known as the "Royal Bird". It is quite possible that this domestication saved the swan from being hunted to extinction in Britain.http://www.northwestswanstudy.org.uk/old/muteswan.htmhttp://www.thamesweb.co.uk/swans/upping2.html
Populations in western Europe were largely exterminated by hunting pressure in the 13th–19th centuries, with the exception of semi-domesticated birds maintained as poultry by large landowners. Better protection in the late 19th and early 20th centuries allowed birds to return to most or all of their former range.[tpl]cite book |title= The Mute Swan in England |last=Ticehurst|first= N. E.| year=1957|publisher= Cleaver-Hume Press|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The Historical Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland 1875–1900 |last=Holloway|first= S. | year=1996 |publisher=Poyser|location= London|isbn= 0-85661-094-1[/tpl] More recently in the period from about 1960 up to the early 1980s, numbers declined significantly again in many areas, primarily due to lead poisoning from birds swallowing discarded fishing sinkers made from lead. After lead weights were replaced by other less toxic alternatives, Mute Swan numbers increased again rapidly.

====Introduced populations====

Since being introduced into North America, the Mute Swan has increased greatly in number, to the extent that it is considered as an invasive species. Populations introduced into other areas remain are small, with around 200 in Japan, less than 200 in New Zealand and Australia, and about 120 in South Africa.

=====North America=====

The Mute Swan was introduced to North America in the late 19th century. Recently, it has been widely viewed as an invasive species because of its rapidly increasing numbers and adverse effects on other waterfowl and native ecosystems. For example, a study of population sizes in the lower Great Lakes from 1971 to 2000 found that Mute Swan numbers were increasing at an average rate of at least 10% per year, doubling the population every seven to eight years.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=14981898 |title=Rapid increase in the lower Great Lakes population of feral mute swans: a review and a recommendation |volume=31 |issue=2 |page=407 |year=2010 |last=Petrie |first= Scott A. |last2=Francis|first2=Charles M.[/tpl] Several studies have concluded that Mute Swans severely reduce densities of submerged vegetation where they occur.[tpl]cite journal| author =Allin, Charles C.; and Husband, Thomas P.|date=September 2003| title=Mute Swan (Cygnus olor) impact on submerged aquatic vegetation and macroinvertebrates in a Rhode Island coastal pond| journal=Northeastern Naturalist| volume=10| issue =3| pages =305–318| doi=10.1656/1092-6194(2003)0100305:MSCOIO2.0.CO;2| issn =1092-6194[/tpl]
In 2003, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to "minimize environmental damages attributed to Mute Swans" by reducing their numbers in the Atlantic Flyway to pre-1986 levels, a 67% reduction at the time. According to a report published in the Federal Register of 2003[tpl]cite journal|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2003/pdf/03-20281.pdf |format=PDF|journal=Federal Register |volume=68|issue=152|page= 47085|last=Williams|first=Steve|title=Finding of No Significant Impact and Final Environmental Assessment for the Management of Mute Swans in the Atlantic Flyway[/tpl] the proposal was supported by all thirteen state wildlife agencies which submitted comments, as well as by 43 bird conservation, wildlife conservation and wildlife management organisations. Ten animal rights organisations and the vast majority of comments from individuals were opposed. At this time Mute Swans were protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act due to a court order, but in 2005 the United States Department of the Interior officially declared them a non-native, unprotected species.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dodpif.org/downloads/MBTRA_70FR372final.pdf |format=PDF|title=Final List of Bird Species to Which the Migratory Bird Treaty Act Does Not Apply[/tpl] Mute Swans are protected in some areas of the U.S. by local laws, as for example in Connecticut.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2007/12/24/bird_lovers_conn_are_at_odds_on_swans/ |title=Bird lovers, Conn. are at odds on swans |newspaper=Boston Globe |accessdate=7 April 2009 |date=24 December 2007[/tpl]
The status of the Mute Swan as an introduced species in North America is disputed by the interest group "Save The Mute Swans".[tpl]cite web|url=http://muteswanadvocacy.com/ |title=Mute Swan Advocacy |publisher=Mute Swan Advocacy |accessdate=2012-05-03[/tpl] They assert that Mute Swans are native in the region and therefore deserving of protection. They claim that Mute Swans had origins from Russia and cite historical sightings and fossil records. These claims have been rejected as specious by the U.S. Department of the Interior.

=====Oceania=====

The Mute Swan had absolute protection in New Zealand under the Wildlife Act 1953 but this was changed in June 2010 to a lower level of protection. It still has protection, but is now allowed to be killed or held in captivity at the discretion of the Minister of Conservation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://feeds.beehive.govt.nz/release/protection+status+changes+wildlife+act|title=Protection status changes to Wildlife Act|date=10 June 2010|publisher=New Zealand Government[/tpl]
A small feral population exists in the vicinity of Perth, Australia, however is believed to number less than 100 individuals.
