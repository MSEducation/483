Taybarns is a British low-cost 'all-you-can-eat' restaurant chain owned by Whitbread, modelled on the US Golden Corral chain. Customers pay on arrival and can eat as much food as they like from a 34-metre food counter.
As with most buffets, there is a lower price at lunchtime than evenings, and at weekends and bank holidays a slightly higher charge is levied.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taybarns.com/home/menus/taybarns-menu.pdf|title=Menu|work=www.taybarns.com|publisher=Whitbread Group PLC|format=PDF|accessdate=7 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/28/taybarns-recession-restaurant|title=How Taybarns tasted success|work=The Guardian|date=28 July 2009|last=Rich|first=Tim|location=London|accessdate=7 July 2010[/tpl]
Food choices consist of themed counters, including: salad bar, soup, "Best Of British" (encapsulating the former "chip shop" and "carvery" counters), pizza, "The Spice Rack" (Tex-Mex), pasta, grill, and dessert, as well as free refills of soft drinks, and a separate drinks menu for alcoholic drinks.

==Locations==

The seven Taybarns restaurants are in Barnsley, Coventry, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Gateshead, South Shields, Swansea, and Wigan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taybarns.com/home/location-finder|title=Location finder|work=www.taybarns.com|publisher=Whitbread Group PLC|accessdate=7 July 2010[/tpl]
In late 2009, the company made public its intention to expand rapidly, with some Brewers Fayre pubs to be converted to the Taybarns brand and up to 30 new restaurants to open the following year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8320043.stm|title=Rise of the all-you-can-eat restaurant|work=BBC News|date=26 October 2009|last=Kent|first=Tamsyn|accessdate=7 July 2010[/tpl]  However, the company has not opened any additional restaurants and continues to operate solely from its seven original locations.
