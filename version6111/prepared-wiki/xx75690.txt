Philippine Airlines Flight 434 (PAL434, PR434) was the route designator of a flight from Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Pasay City in the Philippines, to New Tokyo International Airport (now Narita International Airport), Narita, in Japan, with one stop at Mactan-Cebu International Airport, Cebu, in the Philippines.
On December 11, 1994 the Boeing 747-283B with tail number EI-BWF was flying on the second leg of the route, from Cebu to Tokyo, when a bomb planted by terrorist Ramzi Yousef exploded, killing one passenger and damaging vital control systems. It was a part of the unsuccessful Bojinka terrorist attacks. 57-year-old Captain Eduardo "Ed" Reyes,GovTrack: Senate Record: TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN EDUARDO REYES (110-s20070215-46) an experienced veteran pilot, was able to land the aircraft, saving the plane and all the remaining passengers and crew.  The flight crew also consisted of First Officer Jaime Herrera and Systems Engineer Dexter Comendador.

==Bombing==

===Setting the bomb===

Yousef boarded the aircraft for the Manila to Cebu leg of the flight. After the plane was airborne, he went into the lavatory with his dopp kit in hand and took off his shoes to get out the batteries, wiring, and spark source hidden in the heel (below a level where metal detectors in use at the time could detect anything). Yousef removed an altered Casio digital watch from his wrist to be used as a timer, unpacked the remaining materials from his dopp kit, and assembled his bomb.  He set the timer for four hours later, which was approximately the time at which the plane would be far out over the ocean en route to Tokyo, put the entire bomb back into his dopp kit, and returned to his current seat.
After asking a flight attendant for permission to move to seat 26K, saying he could get a better view from that seat, Yousef moved to that seat and tucked the assembled bomb into the life vest pocket under that seat. He exited the aircraft in Cebu.[tpl]cite book|author=Simon Reeve|title=The New Jackals: Ramzi Yousef, Osama Bin Laden and the Future of Terrorism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VQjpziNmoE4C|year=2002|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-55553-509-4|pages=79[/tpl] Philippine domestic flight attendant Maria dela Cruz noticed that Yousef had switched seats during the course of the Manila to Cebu flight and got off the plane in Cebu with the rest of the domestic flight crew, but did not pass the information along to the international flight crew that boarded at Cebu for the trip to Tokyo. 25 other passengers also got off the plane at Cebu, where 256 more passengers and a new cabin crew boarded the plane for the final leg of the flight to Tokyo.

===Explosion===

After a 38-minute delay the flight took off with a total of 273 passengers on board and 24-year old [tpl]nihongo|Haruki Ikegami|池上春樹|Ikegami Haruki[/tpl], a Japanese industrial sewing machine maker returning from a business trip to Cebu, occupying 26K. Four hours after Yousef planted his bomb, the device exploded underneath Ikegami, killing him and injuring an additional 10 passengers in adjacent seats in front of and behind seat 26K. The blast blew a hole in the floor, and the cabin's rapid expansion from the explosion severed several control cables in the ceiling, which controlled the plane's right aileron, as well as cables that connected to both the pilot and first officer's steering controls. What kept the disaster from being worse was that this particular 747, formerly operated by Scandinavian Airlines, had a different seating configuration and seat 26K was two rows forward of the center fuel tank so that the hole in the floor punched through to the cargo hold instead and spared the plane from a fiery explosion.
The bomb's orientation, positioned front-to-back and upward angled from horizontal, caused the blast to expand vertically and lengthwise. This configuration meant that Ikegami's body absorbed most of the blast force and the plane's outer structure was spared. The lower half of his body fell into the cargo hold and ten passengers sitting in the seats in front of and behind Ikegami were also injured; one needed urgent medical care. The bomb tore out a two square foot (0.2 m2) portion of the cabin floor, revealing the cargo hold underneath, but the fuselage of the plane stayed intact. Additionally, the 38-minute delay in takeoff from Cebu meant the plane was not as far out to sea as anticipated, which contributed to the captain's options available for an emergency landing.
Masaharu Mochizuki, a passenger on the flight, recalled that passengers, both injured and uninjured, initially tried to move away from the blast site, but cabin crew told passengers to remain where they were until an assessment of the situation could be made. The chief economy class flight attendant, Fernando Bayot, moved an injured passenger named Yukihiko Osui away from the bomb site. Bayot then saw Ikegami and tried to pull him out of the hole, but soon realized that most of Ikegami's body below the waist was either damaged or missing entirely. Ikegami died minutes later. Bayot called another flight attendant over to pretend to minister to Ikegami's needs with a blanket and oxygen mask in order to prevent additional panic, then reported the extent of the passenger injuries to the cockpit. Cabin crew members* - who were later commended by President Fidel Ramos for their "professional handling of a potentially disastrous situation"  along with the flight deck crew - were Flight Purser Isidro Mangahas, Jr., Flight Stewards Fernando Bayot, Agustin Azurin, Ronnie Macapagal, E. Reyes, R. Santiago, Flight Attendants M. Alvar, Alpha Nicolasin, Cynthia Tengonciang, Andre Palma, Socorro Mendoza, E. Co, L. Garcia, N. dela Cruz, Adora Altarejos, L. Abella and Japanese Interpreter K. Okada. (* Manila Bulletin, December 18, 1994)

===Landing===

Immediately after the explosion, the aircraft banked hard to the right but the autopilot quickly corrected the bank. After the blast, Reyes asked Comendador to survey the blast site to check for damage. Reyes placed the Mayday call requesting landing at Naha Airport, Okinawa Island, Okinawa Prefecture. The Japanese air traffic controller experienced difficulty in trying to understand Reyes's request, so an American air traffic controller from a United States military base on Okinawa took over and processed Reyes's landing. The autopilot had stopped responding to Reyes's commands and the aircraft flew past Okinawa.
Reyes said in an interview for the Canadian TV series Mayday that when he disengaged the autopilot he feared that the aircraft would bank right again and the crew would lose control of the aircraft; however, because of the pressing need to land quickly to attend to the injured and inspect the plane for additional damage, Reyes instructed Herrera to take hold of his own controls and then Reyes deactivated the autopilot.  The aircraft did not bank after the disengagement of the autopilot, but neither would it respond to steering inputs from either controller due to the control cable damage caused by the bomb. The crew struggled to use the ailerons which could allow the aircraft to turn but were still unable to change the plane's direction. Finally the flight crew disengaged the auto-throttles and resorted to steering via throttle control reminiscent of United Airlines Flight 232.
By using the throttles to steer the plane, reducing air speed to both control the radius of turns and to allow the plane to descend, and dumping fuel to lessen the strain on the landing gear, the captain landed the damaged Boeing 747-283B at Naha Airport at 12:45 p.m., one hour after the bomb exploded. The aircraft's other 272 passengers and 20 crew members survived.

==The bomb==

United States prosecutors said the device was a "Mark II" "microbomb" constructed using Casio digital watches as described in Phase I of the Bojinka plot, for which this was a test.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] On Flight 434, Yousef used one tenth of the explosive power he planned to use on eleven U.S. airliners in January 1995.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] The bomb was, or at least all of its components were, designed to slip through airport security checks undetected.

==Aftermath==

Manila police were able to track the batteries used in the bomb and many of its contents from Okinawa back to Manila. Police uncovered Yousef's plan on the night of January 6 and the early morning of January 7, 1995, and Yousef was arrested a month later in Pakistan.
The aircraft, at the time having the tail number EI-BWF, was later converted to a cargo configuration Boeing 747-2XBF.  It  subsequently changed hands several times, always to air cargo companies, and was finally placed in storage in 2007.Boeing 747 – MSN 21575, airfleets.net

==The current Flight 434==
