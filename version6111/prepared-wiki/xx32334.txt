A number of invertebrates, collectively called cryptofauna, inhabit the coral skeletal substrate itself, either boring into the skeletons (through the process of bioerosion) or living in pre-existing voids and crevices. Those animals boring into the rock include sponges, bivalve mollusks, and sipunculans. Those settling on the reef include many other species, particularly crustaceans and polychaete worms.

===Seabirds===

Coral reef systems provide important habitats for seabird species, some endangered. For example, Midway Atoll in Hawaii supports nearly three million seabirds, including two-thirds (1.5 million) of the global population of Laysan albatross, and one-third of the global population of black-footed albatross.The.honoluluadvertiser.com. The.honoluluadvertiser.com (January 17, 2005). Retrieved on November 1, 2011. Each seabird species has specific sites on the atoll where they nest. Altogether, 17 species of seabirds live on Midway. The short-tailed albatross is the rarest, with fewer than 2,200 surviving after excessive feather hunting in the late19th century.[tpl]cite web | title = U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service – Birds of Midway Atoll | url = http://www.fws.gov/midway/midwaywildlifebirds.html | accessdate = August 19, 2009[/tpl]

==Importance==

Coral reefs deliver ecosystem services to tourism, fisheries and coastline protection. The global economic value of coral reefs has been estimated to be between US $29.8 billion[tpl]cite book|last=Cesar|first=H.J.S|title=The Economics of Worldwide Coral Reef Degradation|year=2003|publisher=Cesar Environmental Economics Consulting|location=The Netherlands|page=4|url=http://assets.panda.org/downloads/cesardegradationreport100203.pdf|coauthors=Burke, L., Pet-Soede, L.|accessdate=21 September 2013[/tpl] and $375 billion per year.[tpl]cite journal|last=Costanza|first=Robert|coauthors=Ralph d'Arge, Rudolf de Groot, Stephen Farber, Monica Grasso, Bruce Hannon, Karin Limburg, Shahid Naeem, Robert V.

To improve the management of coastal coral reefs, another environmental group, the World Resources Institute (WRI) developed and published tools for calculating the value of coral reef-related tourism, shoreline protection and fisheries, partnering with five Caribbean countries.

==Threats==

Coral reefs are dying around the world. In particular, coral mining, agricultural and urban runoff, pollution (organic and inorganic), overfishing, blast fishing, disease, and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems. Broader threats are sea temperature rise, sea level rise and pH changes from ocean acidification, all associated with greenhouse gas emissions. A study released in April 2013 has shown that air pollution can also stunt the growth of coral reefs; researchers from Australia, Panama and the UK used coral records (between 1880 and 2000) from the western Caribbean to show the threat of factors such as coal-burning coal and volcanic eruptions.[tpl]cite web|title=Air pollution casts a cloud over coral reef growth|url=http://theconversation.com/air-pollution-casts-a-cloud-over-coral-reef-growth-13319?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Latest+from+The+Conversation+for+9+April+2013&utm_content=Latest+from+The+Conversation+for+9+April+2013+CID_108dc635aa87df8ce801c5c3cc26a4cd&utm_source=campaign_monitor&utm_term=Air%20pollution%20casts%20a%20cloud%20over%20coral%20reef%20growth|work=The Conversation|publisher=The Conversation Media Group|accessdate=9 April 2013|author=Liz Minchin|date=8 April 2013[/tpl]
In 2011, researchers suggested that "extant marine invertebrates face the same synergistic effects of multiple stressors" that occurred during the end-Permian extinction, and that genera "with poorly buffered respiratory physiology and calcareous shells", such as corals, were particularly vulnerable.[tpl]cite journal|author=Clapham ME and Payne|doi=10.1130/G32230.1|title=Acidification, anoxia, and extinction: A multiple logistic regression analysis of extinction selectivity during the Middle and Late Permian|year=2011|journal=Geology|volume=39|issue=11|page=1059[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Payne JL and Clapham ME |doi=10.1146/annurev-earth-042711-105329|title=End-Permian Mass Extinction in the Oceans: An Ancient Analog for the Twenty-First Century?|year=2012|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|volume=40|page=89[/tpl]Life in the Sea Found Its Fate in a Paroxysm of Extinction New York Times, April 30, 2012.
Another cause for the death of coral reefs is bioerosion. Various fishes graze corals, dead or alive and change the morphology of coral reefs making them more susceptible to other physical and chemical threats. It has been generally observed that only the algae growing on dead corals is eaten and the live ones are not. However, this act still destroys the top layer of coral substrate and makes it harder for the reefs to sustain.[tpl]cite journal |last=Hutchings |first=P.A. |title=Biological destruction of coral reefs |doi=10.1007/BF00298083 |journal=Coral Reefs |publisher=Springer-Verlag |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |year=1986[/tpl]
In El Nino-year 2010, preliminary reports show global coral bleaching reached its worst level since another El Nino year, 1998, when 16% of the world's reefs died as a result of increased water temperature. In Indonesia's Aceh province, surveys showed some 80% of bleached corals died. Scientists do not yet understand the long-term impacts of coral bleaching, but they do know that bleaching leaves corals vulnerable to disease, stunts their growth, and affects their reproduction, while severe bleaching kills them.Losing Our Coral Reefs – Eco Matters – State of the Planet. Blogs.ei.columbia.edu. Retrieved on November 1, 2011. In July, Malaysia closed several dive sites where virtually all the corals were damaged by bleaching.
To find answers for these problems, researchers study the various factors that impact reefs. The list includes the ocean's role as a carbon dioxide sink, atmospheric changes, ultraviolet light, ocean acidification, viruses, impacts of dust storms carrying agents to far-flung reefs, pollutants, algal blooms and others. Reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]

==Protection==

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become increasingly prominent for reef management. MPAs promote responsible fishery management and habitat protection. Much like national parks and wildlife refuges, and to varying degrees, MPAs restrict potentially damaging activities. MPAs encompass both social and biological objectives, including reef restoration, aesthetics, biodiversity, and economic benefits. However there are very few MPAs that have actually made a substantial difference. Research in Indonesia, Philippines and Papua New Guinea shows that there is no significant difference between an MPA site and an unprotected site.[tpl]cite journal |last=McClanahan |first=Timothy |last2=Marnane |first2=Michael |title=A Comparison of Marine Protected Areas and Alternative Approaches to Coral-Reef Management |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.05.062 |journal=Current Biology |volume=16 |issue=14 |year=2006[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Christie |first=P. |title=Marine protected areas as biological successes and social failures in Southeast Asia |url=http://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-24344460900&origin=inward&txGid=D99709748F3514D3637554EEF14AEB58.53bsOu7mi7A1NSY7fPJf1g%3a7 |journal=American Fisheries Society Symposium |volume=2004 |issue=42 |pages=155–164 |year=2004[/tpl] Conflicts surrounding MPAs involve lack of participation, clashing views of the government and fisheries, effectiveness of the area, and funding.[tpl]cite journal |last=McClanahan |first=Timothy |last2=Davies |first2=Jamie |last3=Maina |first3=Joseph |title=Factors influencing resource users and managers' perceptions towards marine protected area management in Kenya |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=314300 |journal=Environmental Conservation |pages=42–49 |doi=10.1017/S0376892904001791 |year=2005[/tpl] In some situations, as in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, MPAs can also provide revenue, potentially equal to the income they would have generated without controls, as Kiribati did for its Phoenix Islands.
To help combat ocean acidification, some laws are in place to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.  The Clean Water Act puts pressure on state government agencies to monitor and limit runoff of pollutants that can cause ocean acidification. Stormwater surge preventions are also in place, as well as coastal buffers between agricultural land and the coastline. This act also ensures that delicate watershed ecosystems are intact, such as wetlands. The Clean Water Act is funded by the federal government, and is monitored by various watershed groups. Many land use laws aim to reduce CO2 emissions by limiting deforestation. Deforestation causes erosion, which releases a large amount of carbon stored in the soil, which then flows into the ocean, contributing to ocean acidification. Incentives are used to reduce miles traveled by vehicles, which reduces the carbon emissions into the atmosphere, thereby reducing the amount of dissolved CO2 in the ocean. State and federal governments also control coastal erosion, which releases stored carbon in the soil into the ocean, increasing ocean acidification.[tpl]cite journal |last=Kelly |first=R.P|first2=et al |year=2011|url=http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/iwgoa/documents/Science-2011-Kelly-1036-7.pdf |title=Mitigating local causes of ocean acidification with existing laws |journal=Science |volume=332 |pages=1036–1037 |doi=10.1126/science.1203815 |pmid=21617060 |last2=Foley |last3=Fisher |first3=WS |last4=Feely |first4=RA |last5=Halpern |first5=BS |last6=Waldbusser |first6=GG |last7=Caldwell |first7=MR |issue=6033 [/tpl]

Efforts to expand the size and number of coral reefs generally involve supplying substrate to allow more corals to find a home. Substrate materials include discarded vehicle tires, scuttled ships, subway cars, and formed concrete, such as reef balls. Reefs also grow unaided on marine structures such as oil rigs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] In large restoration projects, propagated hermatypic coral on substrate can be secured with metal pins, superglue or milliput.Superglue used for placement of coral. coralgarden.co.uk (May 8, 2009).

A substrate for growing corals referred to as Biorock is produced by running low voltage electrical currents through seawater to crystallize dissolved minerals onto steel structures. The resultant white carbonate (aragonite) is the same mineral that makes up natural coral reefs. Corals rapidly colonize and grow at accelerated rates on these coated structures. The electrical currents also accelerate formation and growth of both chemical limestone rock and the skeletons of corals and other shell-bearing organisms. The vicinity of the anode and cathode provides a high-pH environment which inhibits the growth of competitive filamentous and fleshy algae. The increased growth rates fully depend on the accretion activity.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Sabater |first1=Marlowe G. |last2=Yap |first2=Helen T. |year=2004 |title=Long-term effects of induced mineral accretion on growth, survival, and corallite properties of Porites cylindrica Dana |journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology |volume=311 |pages=355–374 | doi = 10.1016/j.jembe.2004.05.013 |url = http://people.uncw.edu/szmanta/2006%20pdfs/21%20Mineral%20accretion/Sabater%20and%20Yap%202004%20long%20term%20growth%20w%20mineral%20accretion.pdf | format=PDF |issue=2 [/tpl]
During accretion, the settled corals display an increased growth rate, size and density, but after the process is complete, growth rate and density return to levels comparable to natural growth, and are about the same size or slightly smaller.
One case study with coral reef restoration was conducted on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The University of Hawaii has come up with a Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program to help relocate and restore coral reefs in Hawaii. A boat channel on the island of Oahu to the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology was overcrowded with coral reefs. Also, many areas of coral reef patches in the channel had been damaged from past dredging in the channel. Dredging covers the existing corals with sand, and their larvae cannot build and thrive on sand; they can only build on to existing reefs. Because of this, the University of Hawaii decided to relocate some of the coral reef to a different transplant site. They transplanted them with the help of the United States Army Divers, to a relocation site relatively close to the channel. They observed very little, if any, damage occurred to any of the colonies while they were being transported, and no mortality of coral reefs has been observed on the new transplant site, but they will be continuing to monitor the new transplant site to see how potential environmental impacts (i.e. ocean acidification) will harm the overall reef mortality rate.  While trying to attach the coral to the new transplant site, they found the coral placed on hard rock is growing considerably well, and coral was even growing on the wires that attached the transplant corals to the transplant site. This gives new hope to future research on coral reef transplant sites. As a result of this coral restoration project, no environmental effects were seen from the transplantation process, no recreational activities were decreased, and no scenic areas were affected by the project. This is a great example that coral transplantation and restoration can work and thrive under the right conditions, which means there may be hope for other damaged coral reefs.[tpl]cite web |last1=Jokeil |first1=P.L. |last2=Ku’lei  |first2=S.R |year=2004 |title= Coral Relocation Project in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii: Report on Phase 1 |work=University of Hawaii | url = http://cramp.wcc.hawaii.edu/Downloads/Publications/TR_Coral_Relocation_Report_1.pdf[/tpl]
Another possibility for coral restoration is gene therapy. Through infecting coral with genetically modified bacteria, it may be possible to grow corals that are more resistant to climate change and other threats.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gene-therapy-help-corals-survive-climate-change |title=Gene Therapy Could Help Corals Survive Climate Change |publisher=Scientific American| date=February 29, 2012[/tpl]

==Reefs in the past==

Throughout Earth history, from a few thousand years after hard skeletons were developed by marine organisms, there were almost always reefs. The times of maximum development were in the Middle Cambrian (513–501 Ma), Devonian (416–359 Ma) and Carboniferous (359–299 Ma), owing to order Rugosa extinct corals, and Late Cretaceous (100–66 Ma) and all Neogene (23 Ma–present), owing to order Scleractinia corals.
Not all reefs in the past were formed by corals: those in the Early Cambrian (542–513 Ma) resulted from calcareous algae and archaeocyathids (small animals with conical shape, probably related to sponges) and in the Late Cretaceous (100–66 Ma), when there also existed reefs formed by a group of bivalves called rudists; one of the valves formed the main conical structure and the other, much smaller valve acted as a cap.
Measurements of the oxygen isotopic composition of the aragonitic skeleton of coral reefs, such as Porites, can indicate changes in the sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity conditions of the ocean during the growth of the coral. This technique is often used by climate scientists to infer the paleoclimate of a region.[tpl]cite journal | author = Cobb, K.| year = 2003 | title = El Nino/Southern Oscillation and tropical Pacific climate during the past millennium | journal = Nature | volume = 424 | pages = 271–6 | url = http://eas8001.eas.gatech.edu/papers/Cobb_Nature_2003.pdf | doi=10.1038/nature01779[/tpl]
