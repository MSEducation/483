==History==

Estadio Jalisco was the home ground of Guadalajara, one of the oldest football teams in Mexico, until 2010. It remains the home stadium of Club Atlas. Both teams play in Liga MX (Mexican First Division League). It is also the home ground of the Club Universidad de Guadalajara from the Liga de Ascenso. Several football preliminary matches took place for the 1968 Summer Olympics.http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1968/1968v2pt1.pdf 1968 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 2. Part 1. p. 79. The stadium has hosted the 1970 and 1986 FIFA World Cup. 
During both of those tourneys the Estadio Jalisco was the temporary home of the Brazilian national team and today remains a liaison between the people of Guadalajara and the Brazilian national team. The stadium is centrally located in the heart of the neighbourhood called Colonia Independencia, and is in front of the Plaza de Toros Nuevo Progreso ("New Progress" Bullring). Its address is Calle Siete Colinas.
After 50 years, Guadalajara moved to the Estadio Omnilife in 2010.
