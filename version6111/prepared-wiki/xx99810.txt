[[Iwasawa decomposition]]

CATEGORIES: Lie groups

In mathematics, the Iwasawa decomposition KAN of a semisimple Lie group generalises the way a square real matrix can be written as a product of an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix (a consequence of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization). It is named after Kenkichi Iwasawa, the Japanese mathematician who developed this method.

==Definition==

and the Iwasawa decomposition of G is 
Iwasawa decompositions also hold for some disconnected semisimple groups G, where K becomes a (disconnected) maximal compact subgroup provided the center of G is finite.
The restricted root space decomposition is

==Examples==

If G=SLn(R), then we can take K to be the orthogonal matrices, A to be the positive diagonal matrices, and N to be the unipotent group consisting of upper triangular matrices with 1s on the diagonal.
