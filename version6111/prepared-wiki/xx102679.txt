[[Lucas–Carmichael number]]

CATEGORIES: Integer sequences

In mathematics, a Lucas–Carmichael number is a positive composite integer n such that if p is a prime factor of n, then p + 1 is a factor of n + 1. 
By convention, a number is only regarded as a Lucas–Carmichael number if it is odd and square-free (not divisible by the square of a prime number), otherwise any cube of a prime number, such as 8 or 27, would be a Lucas–Carmichael number (since n3 + 1 = (n + 1)(n2 − n + 1) is always divisible by n + 1).
Thus the smallest such number is 399 = 3 × 7 × 19; 399+1 = 400; 3+1, 7+1 and 19+1 are all factors of 400.

The smallest LucasCarmichael number with 5 factors is 588455 = 5 × 7 × 17 × 23 × 43.
It is not known whether any Lucas–Carmichael number is also a Carmichael number.
