==Beneficial insects==

Alfalfa is considered an insectary, a place where insects are reared, and has been proposed as helpful to other crops, such as cotton, if the two are interplanted, because the alfalfa harbours predatory and parasitic insects that would protect the other crop.[tpl]cite web|title=Alfalfa as an insectary for beneficial insects|author=  Thomas F. Leigh|url=http://alfalfa.ucdavis.edu/+symposium/proceedings/1991/91-49.pdf ref|date=undated[/tpl] Harvesting the alfalfa by mowing the entire crop area destroys the insect population, but this can be avoided by mowing in strips so that part of the growth remains.

==Pests and diseases==

Like most plants, alfalfa can be attacked by various pests and pathogens. Diseases often have subtle symptoms which are easily misdiagnosed and can affect leaves, roots, and stems.
Some pests, such as the alfalfa weevil, aphids, armyworms, and the potato leafhopper, can reduce alfalfa yields dramatically, particularly with the second cutting when weather is warmest.Insect Pest Management on Alfalfa, FC-ENT-0031-00. Ohioline.osu.edu. Retrieved on 17 October 2011. Chemical controls are sometimes used to prevent this.

==Harvesting==

When alfalfa is to be used as hay, it is usually cut and baled.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uaex.edu/Other_Areas/publications/PDF/FSA-2005.pdf |title=Har vesting Alfalfa Hay |publisher=Uaex.edu |date= |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl] Loose haystacks are still used in some areas, but bales are easier for use in transportation, storage, and feed.G4570 Reducing Losses when Feeding Hay to Beef Cattle | University of Missouri Extension.

When using farm equipment rather than hand-harvesting, a swather cuts the alfalfa and arranges it in windrows.Hay harvesting by Self-Propelled Swather compared with mowing and raking. (PDF) . Retrieved on 17 October 2011. In areas where the alfalfa does not immediately dry out on its own, a machine known as a mower-conditioner is used to cut the hay. The mower-conditioner has a set of rollers or flails that crimp and break the stems as they pass through the mower, making the alfalfa dry faster.hay mower-conditioner (agriculture) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 17 October 2011. After the alfalfa has dried, a tractor pulling a baler collects the hay into bales.
There is also a species of yellow flowered lucerne that can grow fully in 36 hours in perfect conditions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Several types of bales are commonly used for alfalfa. For small animals and individual horses, the alfalfa is baled into small, two-string bales, commonly named by the strands of string used to wrap it. Other bale sizes are three-string, and so on up to half-ton (six-string) "square" bales – actually rectangular, and typically about 40 x 45 x 100 cm (14 x 18 x 38 in). Small square bales weigh from 25–30 kg (50–70 lb) depending on moisture, and can be easily hand separated into "flakes". Cattle ranches use large round bales, typically 1.4 to 1.8 m (4 to 6 ft) in diameter and weighing from 500 to 1,000 kg, (1000 to 2000 lbs). These bales can be placed in stable stacks or in large feeders for herds of horses, or unrolled on the ground for large herds of cattle. The bales can be loaded and stacked with a tractor using a spike, known as a bale spear, that pierces the center of the bale,Washburn Company Auger, Hay bale spear & attachments, Grain Equipment, Fence Line Mower or they can be handled with a grapple (claw) on the tractor's front-end loader. A more recent innovation is large "square" bales, roughly the same proportions as the small squares, but much larger. The bale size was set so stacks would fit perfectly on a large flatbed truck. These are more common in the western United States.
When used as feed for dairy cattle, alfalfa is often made into haylage by a process known as ensiling. Rather than drying it to make dry hay, the alfalfa is chopped finely and fermented in silos, trenches, or bags, where the oxygen supply can be limited to promote fermentation.http://ucanr.org/alf_symp/1995/95-55.pdf[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] The anaerobic fermentation of alfalfa allows it to retain high nutrient levels similar to those of fresh forage, and is also more palatable to dairy cattle than dry hay.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] In many cases, alfalfa silage is inoculated with different strains of microorganisms to improve the fermentation quality and aerobic stability of the silage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM417H.pdf |title=The Ensiling Process and Additives |publisher=Extension.iastate.edu |date= |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]

==Alfalfa and bees==

Alfalfa seed production requires the presence of pollinators when the fields of alfalfa are in bloom. Alfalfa pollination is somewhat problematic, however, because western honey bees, the most commonly used pollinator, are not suitable for this purpose; the pollen-carrying keel of the alfalfa flower trips and strikes pollinating bees on the head, which helps transfer the pollen to the foraging bee. Western honey bees, however, do not like being struck in the head repeatedly and learn to defeat this action by drawing nectar from the side of the flower. The bees thus collect the nectar, but carry no pollen, so do not pollinate the next flower they visit.[tpl]cite journal | first = Susan | last = Milius | date = 6 January 2007 | title = Most Bees Live Alone: No hives, no honey, but maybe help for crops | journal=Science News | volume = 171 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–3 |doi = 10.1002/scin.2007.5591710110[/tpl] Because older, experienced bees do not pollinate alfalfa well, most pollination is accomplished by young bees that have not yet learned the trick of robbing the flower without tripping the head-knocking keel. When western honey bees are used to pollinate alfalfa, the beekeeper stocks the field at a very high rate to maximize the number of young bees.
Western honey bee colonies may suffer protein stress when working alfalfa only, due to shortage of one of the amino acids comprising the pollen protein, isoleucine.
Today, the alfalfa leafcutter bee is increasingly used to circumvent these problems.Alfalfa Leafcutter Bee in California. Pollination.com. Retrieved on 17 October 2011. As a solitary but gregarious bee species, it does not build colonies or store honey, but is a very efficient pollinator of alfalfa flowers. Nesting is in individual tunnels in wooden or plastic material, supplied by the alfalfa seed growers. The leafcutter bees are used in the Pacific Northwest, while western honeybees dominate in California alfalfa seed production.
A smaller amount of alfalfa produced for seed is pollinated by the alkali bee, mostly in the northwestern United States. It is cultured in special beds near the fields. These bees also have their own problems. They are not portable like honey bees, and when fields are planted in new areas, the bees take several seasons to build up. Honey bees are still trucked to many of the fields at bloom time.

==Varieties==

Considerable research and development has been done with this important plant. Older cultivars such as 'Vernal' have been the standard for years, but many better public and private varieties better adapted to particular climates are available.Alfalfa Variety Characteristics, AGF-014-92. Ohioline.osu.edu. Retrieved on 17 October 2011. Private companies release many new varieties each year in the US.[tpl]cite web|url=http://msuextension.org/publications/AgandNaturalResources/MT199303AG.pdf |title=Alfalfa Variety Selection |publisher=Msuextension.org |date= |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]
Most varieties go dormant in the fall, with reduced growth in response to low temperatures and shorter days. 'Nondormant' varieties that grow through the winter are planted in long-seasoned environments such as Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California, whereas 'dormant' varieties are planted in the Upper Midwest, Canada, and the Northeast. 'Nondormant' varieties can be higher-yielding, but they are susceptible to winter-kill in cold climates and have poorer persistence.
Most alfalfa cultivars contain genetic material from sickle medick (M. falcata), a crop wild relative of alfalfa that naturally hybridizes with M. sativa to produce sand lucerne (M. sativa ssp. varia). This species may bear either the purple flowers of alfalfa or the yellow of sickle medick, and is so called for its ready growth in sandy soil.Joseph Elwyn Wing, Alfalfa Farming in the U.S. 79 (Sanders Publishing Co. 1912)".  Traits for insect resistance have also been introduced from M. glomerata and M. prostrata'', members of alfalfa's secondary gene pool.Vincent HA, Wiersema J, Dobbie SL, Kell SP, Fielder H, Castañeda Alvarez NP, Guarino L, Eastwood R, Leόn B, Maxted N. 2012.

Most of the improvements in alfalfa over the last decades have consisted of better disease resistance on poorly drained soils in wet years, better ability to overwinter in cold climates, and the production of more leaves. Multileaf alfalfa varieties have more than three leaflets per leaf, giving them greater nutritional content by weight because there is more leafy matter for the same amount of stem.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]

===Genetically modified alfalfa===

Roundup Ready alfalfa, a genetically modified variety was released by Forage Genetics International in 2005. This was developed through the insertion of a gene owned by Monsanto Company that confers resistance to glyphosate, a broad-spectrum herbicide, also known as Roundup. Although most grassy and broadleaf plants, including ordinary alfalfa, are killed by Roundup, growers can spray fields of Roundup Ready alfalfa with the glyphosate herbicide and kill the weeds without harming the alfalfa crop.

Monsanto had to seek deregulation to conduct field trials of RRA, because the RRA contains a promoter sequence derived from the plant pathogen figwort mosaic virus. The USDA granted the application for deregulation, stating that the RRA with its modifications: "(1) Exhibit no plant pathogenic properties; (2) are no more likely to become weedy than the nontransgenic parental line or other cultivated alfalfa; (3) are unlikely to increase the weediness potential of any other cultivated or wild species with which it can interbreed; (4) will not cause damage to raw or processed agricultural commodities; (5) will not harm threatened or endangered species or organisms that are beneficial to agriculture; and (6) should not reduce the ability to control pests and weeds in alfalfa or other crops."

Alfalfa is briefly mentioned in the fourth century AD book Opus Agriculturae by Palladius, stating: "One sow-down lasts ten years. The crop may be cut four or six times a year ... A jugerum of it is abundantly sufficient for three horses all the year ... It may be given to cattle, but new provender is at first to be administered very sparingly, because it bloats up the cattle."[tpl]cite book|last=Palladius|title=Opus Agriculturae|chapter=Book V, § I[/tpl] Links to online copies are listed at the foot of the Wikipedia article Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius. Palladius called alfalfa medica, a name that referred to the Medes, a people who lived in ancient Iran. The ancient Greeks and Romans believed, probably correctly, that alfalfa came from the Medes, in today's Iran. (The ancient Greeks and Romans also used the name medica to mean a citron fruit, once again because it was believed to have come from the Medes' land). This name is the root of the modern scientific name for the alfalfa genus, Medicago. Despite the report in Opus Agriculturae and in some other Roman and ancient Greek writers, there is little evidence that alfalfa was in widespread use in the Mediterranean region in those days.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Alfalfa was introduced to Spain in the eighth century during the Umayyad conquest of Hispania.

Alfalfa seeds were imported to California from Chile in the 1850s, beginning a rapid and extensive introduction of the crop over the western US States and introducing the word "alfalfa" to the English language. In the North American colonies of the eastern US in the 18th century, it was called "lucerne", and many trials at growing it were made. Its needs weren't well understood, and early attempts at growing it failed; relatively little alfalfa is grown in the southeastern United States today. "Lucerne" is the name currently used for alfalfa in France, Germany and Britain,and arose in the 16th century from the Provençal [tpl]lang|oci|luzerno[/tpl] ("glow worm"), due to its shiny seeds.[tpl]cite web|title=Lucerne|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/etymology/lucerne|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=28 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|title=Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415050774|page=825|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=728Q-hLxaD0C&pg=PT825[/tpl] Since North and South America now produce a large part of the world's output, the word "alfalfa" has been slowly entering other languages.

==Phytoestrogens in alfalfa==

Alfalfa, like other leguminous crops, is a known source of phytoestrogens,[tpl]cite journal|last=Saloniemi|first=Hannu|author2=Wähälä, Kristiina|author3=Nykänen-Kurki, Päivi|author4= Kallela, Kaarlo|author5= Saastamoinen, Ilkka|pmid=7892287|doi=10.3181/00379727-208-43825|volume=208|issue=1|title=Phytoestrogen content and estrogenic effect of legume fodder|date=January 1995|journal=Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine|pages=13–7[/tpl] including spinasterol,[tpl]cite web|title=Chemical Substance - alpha-Spinasterol|url=http://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/ingredReq.do?id=3052&lang=eng|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=3 August 2013|date=8 July 2013[/tpl] coumestrol, and coumestan.[tpl]cite web|title=Notes on poisoning: alfalfa|url=http://www.cbif.gc.ca/pls/pp/ppack.info?p_psn=235&p_type=all&p_sci=comm|work=Canadian Poisonous Plants Information System|publisher=Canadian Biodiversity Information Facility|accessdate=3 August 2013|date=9 January 2009[/tpl] Because of this, grazing on alfalfa has caused reduced fertility in sheep and in dairy cattle.

==Toxicity of canavanine==

Raw alfalfa seeds and sprouts are a source of the amino acid canavanine.  Canavanine competes with arginine, resulting in the synthesis of dysfunctional proteins.  Alfalfa has toxic effects in primates, including humans, which can result in lupus-like symptoms and other immunological diseases in susceptible individuals.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6178289http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1862241  Stopping consumption of alfalfa can reverse the effects.http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/60/4/639.full.pdf

===Sprouting===

Sprouting alfalfa seeds is the process of germinating seeds for consumption usually involving just water and a jar. Sprouting alfalfa usually takes three to four days with one tablespoon of seed yielding up to three full cups of sprouts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://coolshinystuff.com/how-to-sprout-alfalfa |title=How To Sprout Alfalfa |publisher=CoolShinyStuff |date= |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]
