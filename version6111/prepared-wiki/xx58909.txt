A new road (Vhiangburapha Road) which can be accessed by turning left upon exiting the airport also leads southbound to the city centre and is a less congested route, as it is not used by intercity buses heading north. The road joins up with Phahonyothin Road via Pao Khun Road which passes Chiang Rai Provincial Stadium.

The airport's IATA code is CEI and economical flights are made several times daily to Bangkok-Suvarnabhumi (BKK) which is a regional hub airport with daily flights to every major city in the world.
