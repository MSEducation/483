The Pont d'Arc (French pont = bridge) is a large natural bridge, located in the Ardèche département in the south of France, 5 km from the town of Vallon-Pont-d'Arc.http://www.showcaves.com/english/fr/caves/PontDArc.html
The arch, carved out by the Ardèche River, is [tpl]nowrap|60 m[/tpl] wide and [tpl]nowrap|54 m[/tpl] high.  It is a very popular canoeing and kayaking area and is heavily visited by tourists. It is usually described as the natural entrance to the Ardèche Canyon.
In the near vicinity of the arch is the Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave, containing the earliest known paleolithic cave paintings, about 30,000 years old (See also the 3D documentary Cave of Forgotten Dreams by film director Werner Herzog).
