The Supreme Court of the United States handed down nineteen per curiam opinions during its 2009 term, which began on October 5, 2009, and concluded October 3, 2010.The descriptions of three opinions have been omitted.  In Briscoe v. Virginia, 559 U.S. __ (2009).  In Sullivan v. Florida, 560 U.S. __ (2010), the Court vacated the lower court's decision and remanded for further consideration in light of Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. ___ (2010).
Because per curiam decisions are issued from the Court as an institution, these opinions all lack the attribution of authorship or joining votes to specific justices.  All justices on the Court at the time the decision was handed down are assumed to have participated and concurred unless otherwise noted.
