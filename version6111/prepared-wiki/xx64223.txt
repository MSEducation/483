==Impact on Tirana==

Rama's most noted impact on the city of Tirana has been the many kiosk demolitions in the city during his mayorship. Rama's Return to Identity project rid the city of many illegally constructed buildings on municipal lands such as local parks and the banks of the Lana. During this period as mayor he was heavily supported by the Prime Minister of Albania at the time, Ilir Meta, who channeled numerous funds from the central government to the local authority of Tirana, enabling Rama to implement the cleaning master project.
In an attempt to widen roads, he authorized the bulldozing of private properties so that they could be paved over, thus widening streets. He has been accused of corruption and mismanagement of funds by the opposition, including corruption in the issuance of building permits.
His Clean and Green project in 2000 resulted in the production of 96,700 square metres of green land and parks in the city and the planting of nearly 1,800 trees.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] He also ordered the painting of many old buildings in what has come to be known as Edi Rama colours (very bright pink, yellow, green, violet). Rama's critics claimed that he focused too much attention on cosmetic changes without fixing any of the major problems such as shortages of drinking water and electricity. As of the end of Rama's 11-year mayoral term, running water in Tirana continued to be available for only 6 hours a day.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]

==Politics==

Edi Rama is also the head of the left wing in Albania. He became head of SPA in October 2005. In the 2009 elections, SPA was the most voted party, but got only 65 seats on the parliament out of 140 because of the electoral system[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]. SMI and DPA formed a coalition and a government, while SPA started a few protests for "the transparency of vote". Nowadays, the SPA members of the parliament have joined the Parliament sessions and co-work with their right-wing colleagues.
Rama is being criticised by a group of SPA politicians like Fatos Nano, Arben Malaj, Kastriot Islami, Andis Harasani of leading the party with authoritarian methods. These accusations may be because he has excluded from the Socialist Party founding member with major contributions in the party and has not appreciated the great contribution of Fatos Nano in the Socialist Party. The second-most-powerful person in SPA is 59 year old Gramoz Ruçi, the head of the Parliamentarian group and former chief of secret police during communist dictatorship.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
Rama said of his time as mayor of Tirana: "It's the most exciting job in the world, because I get to invent and to fight for good causes everyday. Being the mayor of Tirana is the highest form of conceptual art. It's art in a pure state."http://www.internationalspecialreports.com/europe/albania/youvegottotear.html
On 21 January 2011, Rama took part in the 2011 Albanian opposition demonstrations, in which four people were killed and 150 injured.
