==Career==

===Dundee United===

Having been developed as a player through Dundee United's youth scheme, he turned professional with the club in July 1999. He was given his debut by then-manager Alex Smith in December 2001, when he was used as a right wing back in a match at Kilmarnock, and went on to make nine appearances that season, collecting the April 'Young Player of the Month' award.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scotprem.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Awards/0,,10002,00.html |title=SPL monthly awards|publisher=Scotprem.com|accessdate=2008-08-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080205182504/http://www.scotprem.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Awards/0,,10002,00.html |archivedate = 5 February 2008[/tpl] In 2002–03, Duff had his best run of league games, playing 34 times. When Ian McCall was appointed at the start of the 2003–04 season, Duff found himself more often as a substitute, playing in just 18 league games. During that season, Duff was part of the Scotland under-21 side that narrowly missed out on qualifying for the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, with Scotland losing to Croatia in the play-off.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/scotland/3279791.stm|title=Young Scots make brave exit|date=18 November 2003|publisher=BBC Sport website[/tpl] The following season, Duff played 25 league games, earning him a new three-year contract in March 2005.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee_utd/4249705.stm|title=Duff agrees new United contract|date=30 March 2005|publisher=BBC Sport website[/tpl] Shortly afterwards, Duff was part of the United side that lost narrowly to Celtic in the Scottish Cup final, with his 83rd-minute substitute appearance earning him a runners-up medal.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/4586123.stm|title=Celtic 1–0 Dundee United|publisher=BBC Sport website|date=28 May 2005[/tpl]
In 2005–06, with Gordon Chisholm the new manager, Duff played more first team games, with 29 league appearances. During February 2006, Duff alleged he was spat on by Hearts midfielder Rudi Skacel,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee_utd/4694108.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|date=10 February 2006|title=Skacel spit claim is not pursued[/tpl] a claim repeated two months later by Celtic captain Neil Lennon.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/4962096.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|date=1 May 2006|title=Lennon and Skacel row over spit[/tpl] No action was taken against Skacel in either incident. Duff scored an important goal in the 1–0 win over Rangers at Ibrox during the season, which helped United avoid relegation. Duff started the 2006–07 season as an attacking midfielder under Craig Brewster and scored once, although was used in a variety of defensive roles under Craig Levein. 
On 29 December 2006, Duff appeared before the Sheriff Court in Dundee and admitted to driving under the influence of alcohol on 17 December. He was fined £750 and banned from driving for 15 months. The judge, however, said Duff's reputation as 'a gentleman' was clear to see.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2006/12/29/newsstory9112373t0.asp|title=Drunken player's 'fall from grace'|publisher=The Courier|date=29 December 2006[/tpl]

===Aberdeen===

In January 2008, Levein told Duff he was free to leave Tannadice and find himself a new club, having been in good form until a freak motorcycle accident which saw him get '3 feet of air'. He was released on 17 January,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/|title=Stuart Duff released|publisher=Dundee United FC|date=17 January 2008[/tpl] after playing 170 games for the club, scoring four times. Duff began training with fellow SPL side Aberdeen and a short-term move to his home town club was confirmed the following day, seeing him become the third player to move from Tannadice to Pittodrie in eighteen months, following Lee Miller[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aberdeen/5295368.stm| title=Dons take Miller from Dundee Utd|publisher=BBC Sport website|date=31 August 2006[/tpl] and Lee Mair.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aberdeen/6447403.stm| title=Mair completes Pittodrie switch|publisher=BBC Sport website|date=1 May 2007[/tpl] Within six weeks of arriving, however, Duff was one of several players manager Jimmy Calderwood threatened to release at the end of the season, due to the club's poor performances.[tpl]cite news|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/spl/Calderwood-plans-39major--rebuilding39.3813899.jp|publisher=The Scotsman|date=26 February 2008|author=Wright, Angus|title=Calderwood plans 'major rebuilding'[/tpl] In May 2008, Duff instead signed a two-year contract extension with Aberdeen.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aberdeen/7423908.stm|title=Duff signs new deal at Pittodrie|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 May 2008 | date=28 May 2008[/tpl]

After his release by Aberdeen, Duff had a trial spell with St. Johnstone and turned down an approach from St. Mirren before signing for Inverness CT. Duff agreed a deal that was to run until the end of the 2010–11 season. Throughout the 2010/11 season he was a regular starter for Caley, and featured in most of their surprising results. These included a 1–1 draw against Rangers at Ibrox and a 2–2 draw with Celtic at Parkhead.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/198196/Duff-returns-for-a-second-stint-at-Caley |title=Duff returns for a second stint at Caley |work=Daily Express |date=8 September 2010 |accessdate=8 September 2010 |last=Esson |first=Blair[/tpl] His contract expired with ICT at the end of the 2010/11 season, and he stated his desire to stay with Inverness and said he would accept their contract offer after returning from holiday. In the summer of 2011, a contract was offered, but no deal was agreed and the contract offer was eventually withdrawn.
