</ref> They are employed in typical [[35 mm film|35mm]], [[IMAX]] and the new [[digital projectors]] [[Movie projector|film projection]] systems, automotive [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID]] headlights, high-end [[tactical light|"tactical" flashlights]] and other specialized uses. These arc lamps are an excellent source of short wavelength [[ultraviolet]] radiation and they have intense emissions in the near [[infrared]], which is used in some [[night vision]] systems.
The individual cells in a plasma display use a mixture of xenon and neon that is converted into a plasma using electrodes. The interaction of this plasma with the electrodes generates ultraviolet photons, which then excite the phosphor coating on the front of the display.[ref]

Xenon is used as a "starter gas" in high pressure sodium lamps. It has the lowest thermal conductivity and lowest ionization potential of all the non-radioactive noble gases. As a noble gas, it does not interfere with the chemical reactions occurring in the operating lamp. The low thermal conductivity minimizes thermal losses in the lamp while in the operating state, and the low ionization potential causes the breakdown voltage of the gas to be relatively low in the cold state, which allows the lamp to be more easily started.

In 1962, a group of researchers at Bell Laboratories discovered laser action in xenon,[ref]
