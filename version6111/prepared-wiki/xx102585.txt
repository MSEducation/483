Schmit (of the Eagles) who only recorded backing vocals.http://www.nysse.com/jw/anthology.html

==Critical reception==

Upon its release, the album was poorly conceived by many critics, but sold quite well, Writing for AllMusic, critic James Chrispell highly complimented the title track, but wrote of the album "Joe Walsh just hasn't been able to produce a complete album of great material, and The Confessor is no exception. The first half is dreck... Worthwhile for the title track alone."
Guitar World, critic Bruce Malamut wrote that the album is "the apologia of a strictly raised mid-western episcopalian after living in rock and roll sin for ‘Fifteen Years’ on the road," and that "The balance … is a sober retrospective from rock’s own Harpo Marx.",http://www.answers.com/topic/joe-walsh Rolling Stone said that "Walsh is trying to make the kind of record he used to make a decade ago, and the result is, well, out of date, sound like something out of a 1975 time capsule."

==Live performances and Tour==

After the release of the album, Walsh toured again with Joe Vitale in Australia and in the US. In Australia the band was called "Creatures From America". In the US they were the opening act on some gigs for Foreigner.http://waddywachtelinfo.com/JoeWalsh2.html
