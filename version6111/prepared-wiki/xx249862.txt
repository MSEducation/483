[[Hasta pura (military decoration)]]

CATEGORIES: Military awards and decorations of ancient Rome

The Hasta Pura or Hasta Donatica was a decoration for merit, awarded in Ancient Rome.[ref]See the German Source on http://www.gottwein.de/latine/LLLh1.php
"hasta Lanze, Stoßwaffe im Gegensatz zum Pilum, hasta pura Ehrenlanze, die einen Schaft aus Edelmetall und statt einer Spitze einen Knauf hatte. Sie wurde als Auszeichnung für Tapferkeit vergeben. (Source: Suetonius.Claud.28,1).[/ref] The Roman sources do not concur about the precise character of the decoration. Some call it a decoration for valour, others mention that it has been awarded to civilians.
The hasta was a thrusting weapon that was not thrown as were the later pilum, verutum or lancea. A hasta pura was a spear made "without iron"Pliny. 7, 28, 29, § 102Suet. Claud. 28Lewis&Short at Perseus and was in the earliest times the reward of a soldier the first time that he conquered in battle.Serv. ad Virg. Æn. vi. 760 Later it came to be awarded to a soldier who had struck down an enemy in a sally or skirmish.Lips. ad Polyb. de Milit. Rom. v. 17[tpl]cite book|last=Rev.

Tacitus records a hasta pura being given as a decoration, bestowed upon a soldier for saving the life of a fellow-citizen:
A civil servant called Tiberius Claudius Balbilus was awarded the hasta pura and perhaps also the corona aurea by Claudius during the Triumph to celebrate the conquest of Britain in 44AD.(Source: Suetonius.Claud.28,1). As a friend and part of the Emperor’s retinue, it seems likely that his awards, as much as his military rank, were honorary.See http://www.legioxx.org.uk/xxdona.html Maxfield 1981, 160-161 It is also mentioned in the article Hasta (spear).
The hasta pura was also recorded as being given to the Primus Pilus when he had completed his period of service.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] Also, such a gift is sometimes recorded in funereal inscriptions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
Some have taken "without iron" to mean that the hasta pura had no head at all. The main evidence in support of this conjecture is that representations on some coins show a blunt spear. However, other coins clearly show a sharp spearhead and those that do not may be explained by poorly made coins or poorly drawn representations of them in publications.[tpl]sfn|Maxfield|1992|pp=85-86[/tpl] The hasta pura is mentioned in the second part of the Claudius novels by Robert Graves. Graves calls the decoration an "Arrow without a head", and refers to its award to Balbilus.See Claudius the God and his Wife Messalina. London: Arthur Barker, 1934; New York: Smith & Haas, 1935.
