Comic Book Resources, also known as CBR, is a website dedicated to the coverage of comic book–related news and discussion.

==History==

Comic Book Resources was founded by Jonah Weiland in 1996 as a development of the Kingdom Come Message Board, a message forum that Weiland had created to discuss DC Comics's then-new miniseries of the same name.
In addition to having an active message board, Comic Book Resources also has weekly columns written by industry professionals that have included Warren Ellis, Erik Larsen, Steven Grant, Robert Kirkman, Gail Simone, Rich Johnston, Scott Shaw, Rob Worley, Rik Offenberger, Keith Giffen and Mark Millar. Other columns are published by comic-book historians and critics such as George Khoury and Timothy Callahan. Columns include "Comic Book Legends Revealed".

==Comic Book Idol==

Comic Book Idol, also known as CBI, is an amateur comic book art competition created and hosted by award-winning comic writer J. Torres, and sponsored by Comic Book Resources and its participating advertisers. Deriving the idea from the singing contest American Idol, CBI is a five-week and five-round competition in which each contestant is asked to draw a script provided by guest judges in a period of one week. These invited comic book professionals will then comment on the artists' work in each round. Fans will then determine which contestants will move on to subsequent rounds by voting in a weekly poll.Comic Book Idol 3 - The Amateur Art Contest from Comic Book Resources » Just the FAQs, m'am
