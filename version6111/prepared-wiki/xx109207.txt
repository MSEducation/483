[[Republic of Morac-Songhrati-Meads]]

CATEGORIES: Micronations, Spratly Islands, States and territories established in the 1870s

The Republic of Morac-Songhrati-Meads was originally a micronation in the Spratly Islands established by British naval captain James George Meads in the 1870s.

==History==

The republic's history begins with Captain Meads, who laid claim to the Islands in the 1870s. Meads was exploring the South China Sea and laid claim to the Spratly Islands. Descendants of Meads have continued to posit legitimacy over the islands, and ownership of the island's resources.[tpl]cite book|title=Law, Power, and the Sovereign State|last=Fowler|first=Michael|coauthor=Julie Marie Bunck|url=http://books.google.com/?id=oAp_97VvpMIC&pg=PA54&dq=%22James+George+Meads%22|pages=54–55|year=1995|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=0-271-01470-9[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Whiting|first=Kenneth|title=Asian Nations Squabble Over Obscure String of Islands|work=Los Angeles Times|page=A2|date=2 February 1992[/tpl] However, there is no contemporary evidence of the existence of this state. There is no reliable information available about the life of Meads: his name does not appear in the archives of the British armed forces.

===Kingdom of Humanity===

A rival entity called the "Kingdom of Humanity" formed in 1914 under the leadership of Franklin M. Meads, the son of James George. The two rival factions occupied the islands until World War II, when they were driven out by Japanese troops. Franklin died in 1945, and his son Josiah took over leadership; Josiah himself died soon after. His son, Morton F. Meads, was to succeed but was deemed too young.[tpl]cite book|last=Samuels|first=Marwyn|title=Contest for the South China Sea|year=1982|pages=169–71[/tpl] The Kingdom of Humanity reunified back into the republic in 1963.

===Legal attempts at legitimacy===

The Kingdom faded into obscurity over the next decade until 1972, when the then-ruling Morton Meads unsuccessfully petitioned the United Nations, Chiang Kai-Shek of the Republic of China, and the Republic of the Philippines to recognise the Kingdom and its claims. Later that year, the remainder of the Kingdom's governing body drowned in a shipwreck, except for Meads.
The Kingdom reappeared in 1985 when Meads sued the United States and others for $25 billion, claiming "unfair competition, harassment, and sabotage." The case was not heard.[tpl]cite news|author=Miami Herald Staff|title=Atlantis And Other Wild Claims|work=Miami Herald|date=31 May 1992|page=11F[/tpl]
