Whitworth Sharpshooters were the Confederates' answer to the Union sharpshooter regiments and used the English Whitworth rifle.Joseph G. Bilby, Civil War Firearms: Their Historical Background and Tactical Use, (Da Capo Press, 1996), 119. These men accompanied regular infantrymen- their occupation was usually eliminating Union artillery gun crews.

==The rifle==

The gun proved to be an accurate and deadly instrument. Its most remembered act was on May 9, 1864 at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, where Union General John Sedgwick urged his men to leave a ditch in which they lay in order to cover from the Confederate snipers hidden 800 to 1000 yards away. According to Martin T. McMahon, Brevet Major-General, U.S.V. Sixth Corps, he and General Sedgwick were walking along the line when he Sedgwick noticed a soldier dodging a near-passing bullet, and said to him - 
Just seconds later he fell forward with a bullet hole below his left eye.According to Rhea, the preeminent historian of the Overland Campaign, pp. 93-96, there is no record of the identity or location of the sharpshooter. Union troops from the 6th Vermont claim to have shot an unidentified sharpshooter as they crossed the fields seeking revenge. Ben Powell of the 12th South Carolina claimed credit, although his account has been discounted because the general he shot at with a Whitworth rifled musket was mounted, probably Brig Gen. William H. Morris. Thomas Burgess of the 15th South Carolina has also been cited by some veterans.[tpl]Cite book|last=Crocker III|first=H.
