Watchers 3 is the 1994 sequel to the horror film Watchers directed by Jeremy Stanford.  Starring B movie veteran Wings Hauser, the film is loosely based on the novel Watchers by Dean Koontz.  Produced by Roger Corman, Watchers 3 was shot entirely on location in Peru. 

==Plot==

A top secret experiment spawns two highly intelligent life-forms: Einstein, a golden retriever with an IQ of 175; and the Outsider, a deformed monstrosity that exists to kill and to avenge its creators. When the Outsider escapes into the jungles of South America, the government sends in Ferguson (Wings Hauser) and some ex-military convicts to catch the beast. But what starts out as a high-speed chase ends in carnage. Only Einstein knows the Outsider's motives, and only the canine can outsmart the creature.

==Release==

This sequel did not receive the benefit of a theatrical release as the original did.  Instead, the film went straight-to-video.  The film was released on a DVD by New Concorde Home Entertainment in 2003.  The film is notable in that many reviewers remarked how the plot copied the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Predator.
