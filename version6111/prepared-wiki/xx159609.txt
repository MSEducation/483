[[Johannes Pedersen (theologian)]]

CATEGORIES: 1883 births, 1977 deaths, Danish theologians, Linguists from Denmark

Johannes Pedersen (1883-1977) was a noted theologian and linguist.
Pedersen believed that "objective thought, that is to say, inactive, disinterested thought" does not exist in most instances.  Pederson was committed to the assumption that the full social context is necessary to understanding written texts.
Pedersen pointed out that in Genesis a soul is a person, not some invisible something inside a person.  Consistently, passage after passage in Genesis, this is shown to be the case.
He brilliantly understood the ideas behind the unity of the soul and body and helped many notable students write their papers. Including Peter Atkinson, who went on to become the renowned theologian of his day.
