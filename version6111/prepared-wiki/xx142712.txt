Young Dracula was a British teenage  horror drama television series airing on CBBC, loosely based on Young Dracula and Young Monsters, a children's book by Michael Lawrence. The final episode aired on March 31, 2014.
The first two series follow the Dracula family, a family of vampires: Vladimir (Vlad), his father Count Dracula, and paternal older half- sister Ingrid. Having lived in Transylvania, they move to Stokely, a small town in Wales after various incidents involving angry peasant mobs. It was filmed in various locations around Wales, including Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf, Caerphilly Castle, Tretower Court and parts of Llantrisant. Directed by Joss Agnew, the first series was broadcast in 2006, and the second series, which started in late 2007, concluded in early 2008.
The third series, commissioned three years after the second, sees Vlad and the Count flee both vampires and slayers, while the Count is determined that Vlad should fulfil his destiny to become "the Chosen One". This series was filmed in Liverpool during 2011, in various locations including the disused Margaret Bevan School, Croxteth Hall and Stanley Docks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.how-do.co.uk/north-west-media-news/north-west-broadcasting/waterloo-road-heads-to-scotland-20110823100955217 |title=Waterloo Road heads to Scotland |publisher=How-Do |date=23 August 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016vvt0 |title=CBBC Programmes - Young Dracula, Series 3, Hide and Seek |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=1 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Behind the scenes at Young Dracula|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/clips/p00lr6wd|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 March 2013[/tpl] It began airing on 31 October 2011.
