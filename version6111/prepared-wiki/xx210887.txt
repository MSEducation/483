Ahmad Abdul-Jabar ([tpl]lang-ar|احمد عبدالجبار[/tpl]) (born 8 January 1978 in Iraq) is an Iraqi football player who currently plays for Baghdad FC in Iraq and Iraq national football team player.
Ahmed, known as Al-Alemane ('The German') by his team-mates, due to his fair skin and hair. He beared a slight  resemblance to Brazilian Juninho of Middlesbrough and Atletico Madrid.
The qualified engineer also had the diminutive Brazilian's same penchant for taking on defenders with mazey runs and is often employed to support the front two. In 1996, he moved to Al-Zawraa from Al-Karkh formerly known as Al Rasheed, a club he joined at the age of 11 and flourished under coaches Amer Jamil and then Adnan Hamad.
It was Hamad who encouraged him to use his imagination more on the field, by thinking of himself as a fox; cunning and clever.[tpl]cite web|publisher=www.iraqsport.com|author=Hassanin Mubarak & Salem Dawood|title=Player Database |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010424230233/http://iraqsport.com/cgi-bin/db/db.cgi?db=players&uid=default&view_records=1&ID=*&nh=3[/tpl]
