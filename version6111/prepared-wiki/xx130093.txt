The album features remix version of "Tokyo Maigo", a song released as a less successful lead single in June 1991. Gospelesque "Odayaka na Jidai" is a remake version of a song that she originally contributed for the news program News Station aired on TV Asahi in the mid 1980s. "Ta-Wa-Wa" features horn sections that played by the members of a group Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra who were still not famous at that time.
Backing tracks of the songs like "Nagisa e" and "Minami Sanjou" were mostly recorded with North American session musicians including Abe Laboriel, Paulinho da Costa and Dean Parks. In addition to such musicians, Rita Coolidge participated in "Odayaka na Jidai" as one of the backing vocalists. Since Uta de shika Ienai album, Nakajima came to appoint those distinguished players for her recording.
