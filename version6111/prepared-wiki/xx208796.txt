The Building at 614 Main Street in Barnstable, Massachusetts is a modest commercial building built in 1910.  Stylistically, the single story wood frame building is similar to 606 Main Street, although it has more obvious Arts and Crafts features, including exposed rafters.  The building has a gable roof, whose front slope includes a shed-roof dormer providing access to storage space above the stores.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=BRN.630|title=MACRIS inventory record for 614 Main Street|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2014-03-30[/tpl]
