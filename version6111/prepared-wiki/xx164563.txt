The 1947 Philadelphia Athletics season involved the A's finishing fifth in the American League with a record of 78 wins and 76 losses.
Except for a fifth-place finish in 1944, the A’s finished in last or next-to-last place every year from 1935–1946. In 1947, Connie Mack not only got the A’s out of last place, but actually finished with a winning record for the first time in 14 years.
