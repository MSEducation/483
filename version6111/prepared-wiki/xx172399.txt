Gilwern stands on the edge of the Brecon Beacons National Park. The local area has a history of iron and lime production.http://www.ggat.org.uk/cadw/historic_landscape/clydach_gorge/english/clydach_008.htm The Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, which has a wharf at Gilwern, was built to transport coal, limestone and iron products from the surrounding area using a network of tramways and railroads. The Clydach Railroad and the Llam-march Tramroad both serviced the wharf with materials gathered and produced further up the Clydach Gorge. Both are still visible, the former being a road and the latter a footpath between Gilwern and Clydach. The canal crosses the River Clydach on the Gilwern Aqueduct, an embankment over 90 feet highhttp://www.visitoruk.com/Abergavenny/gilwern-C592-V3122.html just next to Gilwern Wharf.
Gilwern Hill lies to the south of the village.
