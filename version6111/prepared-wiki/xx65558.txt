A political party platform or platform is a list of the values and actions which are supported by a political party or individual candidate, in order to appeal to the general public, for the ultimate purpose of garnering the general public's support and votes about complicated topics or issues. "Plank" is the term often given to the componentry of the political platform, in terms of the opinions and viewpoints about individual topics, as held by a party, person, or organization.
