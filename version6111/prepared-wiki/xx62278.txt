Golden World Records was a record label owned by Ed Wingate and Joanne Bratton (n√©e Jackson, widow of boxing champion Johnny Bratton). The recording studio was located in Detroit, MI., first on 11801 12th Street (Rosa Parks), and then on 3246 West Davison, within the area of the present-day Davison Freeway. A business office on some of the labels reads 4039 Buena Vista. 
Besides the following discography, the studio's national hits included "Oh How Happy" by Livonia, Michigan's Shades of Blue and "Cool Jerk" by the Capitols. The early, pre-Motown songs by Edwin Starr (War! What is it Good For?) such as "Agent Double-O-Soul" were recorded in the Golden World studio.
Golden World operated from 1962 to 1968. 
The label and its subsidiaries were purchased by Berry Gordy in 1966, and folded into Gordy's Motown Record Corporation. The Golden World studio became Motown's "Studio B", working in support of the original Motown recording studio (Studio A) at Hitsville USA.  Before its purchase by Gordy, the studio's recordings often included moonlighting Motown back-up musicians, including James Jamerson on bass and George McGregor, who was the studio percussionist.
The famous clock that hung in Golden World Records is currently owned by Melodies and Memories in Eastpointe, Michigan and is on display there.
