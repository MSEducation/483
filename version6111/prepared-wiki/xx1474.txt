A former owner of a minor league franchise in Milwaukee, Veeck brought to Cleveland a gift for promotion. At one point, Veeck hired rubber-faced[tpl]cite news |title=Baseball's Clown Prince Dies |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/10/30/archive/main68511.shtml |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2008-02-17[/tpl] Max Patkin, the "Clown Prince of Baseball" as a coach. Patkin's appearance in the coaching box was the sort of promotional stunt that delighted fans but infuriated the American League front office.
Recognizing that he had acquired a solid team, Veeck soon abandoned the aging, small and lightless League Park to take up full-time residence in massive Cleveland Municipal Stadium.[tpl]cite book | last =Borsvold | first = David  | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = The Cleveland Indians: Cleveland Press Years, 1920–1982 | publisher = Arcadia Publishing  | year = 2003 | location = | pages =37–38  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=v0hgrNuScVMC&pg=PA37&dq= | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7385-2325-9[/tpl] The Indians had briefly moved from League Park to Municipal Stadium in mid-1932, but moved back to League Park due to complaints about the cavernous environment.  From 1936 onward, however, the Indians began playing an increasing number of games at Municipal, until by 1940 they played most of their home slate there.[tpl]cite book|last=Lowry|first=Phillip|title=Green Cathedrals|year=2005|publisher=Walker & Company|location=New York City|isbn=0-8027-1562-1[/tpl] League Park was demolished in 1951, although a portion of the original ticket booth remains.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070806&content_id=2133242&vkey=cle_gameface&fext=.jsp&c_id=cle |title= League Park may glisten once again|accessdate=2008-06-28 |work= |publisher=Cleveland Indians.com |date= [/tpl]
Making the most of the cavernous stadium, Veeck had a portable center field fence installed, which he could move in or out depending on how the distance favored the Indians against their opponents in a given series. The fence moved as much as [tpl]convert|15|ft|m|0[/tpl] between series opponents. Following the 1947 season, the American League countered with a rule change that fixed the distance of an outfield wall for the duration of a season.  The massive stadium did, however, permit the Indians to set the then record for the largest crowd to see a Major League baseball game.  On October 10, 1948, Game 5 of the World Series against the Boston Braves drew over 84,000. The record stood until the Los Angeles Dodgers drew a crowd in excess of 92,500 to watch Game 5 of the 1959 World Series at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum against the Chicago White Sox.
Under Veeck's leadership, one of Cleveland's most significant achievements was breaking the color barrier in the American League by signing Larry Doby, formerly a player for the Negro League's Newark Eagles in [tpl]By|1947[/tpl], eleven weeks after Jackie Robinson signed with the Dodgers.  Similar to Robinson, Doby battled racism on and off the field but posted a .301 batting average in 1948, his first full season. A power-hitting center fielder, Doby led the American League twice in homers.
In 1948, needing pitching for the stretch run of the pennant race, Veeck turned to the Negro League again and signed pitching great Satchel Paige amid much controversy.  Barred from Major League Baseball during his prime, Veeck's signing of the aging star in 1948 was viewed by many as another publicity stunt. At an official age of 42, Paige became the oldest rookie in Major League baseball history, and the first black pitcher. Paige ended the year with a 6–1 record with a 2.48 ERA, 45 strikeouts and two shutouts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CLE/1948.shtml |title= Satchel Paige 1948 Statistics|accessdate=2008-06-28 |work=|publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date= [/tpl]
In [tpl]MLBy|1948[/tpl], veterans Boudreau, Keltner, and Joe Gordon had career offensive seasons, while newcomers Doby and Gene Bearden also had standout seasons. The team went down to the wire with the Boston Red Sox, winning a one-game playoff, the first in American League history, to go to the World Series. In the series, the Indians defeated the Boston Braves four games to two for their first championship in 28 years. Boudreau won the American League MVP Award.
The Indians would appear in a film the following year titled The Kid From Cleveland, in which Veeck had an interest.  The film portrayed the team helping out a "troubled teenaged fan"[tpl]cite web |title=The Kid from Cleveland |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041545/ |publisher=IMDB.com | accessdate=2009-02-17[/tpl] and featured many members of the Indians organization. However, filming during the season cost the players valuable rest days leading to fatigue towards the end of the season.  That season, Cleveland again contended before falling to third place. On September 23, 1949, Bill Veeck and the Indians buried their 1948 pennant in center field the day after they were mathematically eliminated from the pennant race.
Later in 1949, Veeck's first wife (who had a half-stake in Veeck's share of the team) divorced him. With most of his money tied up in the Indians, Veeck was forced to sell the team[tpl]cite book | last =Ribowsky | first = Mark | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Don't Look Back: Satchel Paige in the Shadows of Baseball  | publisher = De Capo Press  | year = 2000  | location =  | page =286  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=LT2pirW9nSYC&pg=RA1-PA286&dq= | doi =  | id = | isbn = 0-306-80963-X[/tpl] to a syndicate headed by insurance magnate Ellis Ryan.

===The 1950s: Near misses===

Ryan was forced out in [tpl]MLBy|1953[/tpl] in favor of Myron Wilson, who in turn gave way to William Daley in [tpl]MLBy|1956[/tpl].  Despite this turnover in the ownership, a powerhouse team composed of Feller, Doby, Minnie Miñoso, Luke Easter, Bobby Ávila, Al Rosen, Early Wynn, Bob Lemon, and Mike Garcia continued to contend through the early 1950s. However, Cleveland only won a single pennant in the decade, in 1954, finishing second to the New York Yankees five times.
The winningest season in franchise history came in 1954, when the Indians finished the season with a record of 111-43 (.721). That mark set an American League record for wins which stood for 44 years until the Yankees won 114 games in 1998 (a 162-game regular season). The Indians 1954 winning percentage of .721 is still an American League record. The Indians returned to the World Series to face the New York Giants. The team could not bring home the title, however, ultimately being upset by the Giants in a sweep. The series was notable for Willie Mays' over-the-shoulder catch off the bat of Vic Wertz in Game 1.

===1960–1993: The 30-year slump===

From 1960 to 1993, the Indians managed one third-place finish (in 1968) and six fourth-place finishes (in 1960, 1974 to 1976, 1990, and 1992) but spent the rest of the time at or near the bottom of the standings.

====Frank Lane becomes general manager====

The Indians hired general manager Frank Lane, known as "Trader" Lane, away from the St. Louis Cardinals in 1957. Lane over the years had gained a reputation as a GM who loved to make deals.  With the White Sox, Lane had made over 100 trades involving over 400 players in seven years.[tpl]cite book | last =Eisenbath  | first = Mike  | authorlink =  | coauthors =Stan Musial  | title = The Cardinals Encyclopedia | publisher = Temple University Press  | year = 1999  | location =  | pages =  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=hymGG28xYcoC&pg=PA410&lpg=PA410&dq=  | doi =  | id = | isbn = 1-56639-703-0[/tpl]  In a short stint in St. Louis, he traded away Red Schoendienst and Harvey Haddix.  Lane summed up his philosophy when he said that the only deals he regretted were the ones that he didn't make.
One of Lane's early trades in Cleveland was to send Roger Maris to the Kansas City Athletics in the middle of 1958. Indians executive Hank Greenberg was not happy about the trade[tpl]cite book  | last =Rosenfeld  | first = Harvey  | authorlink =  | coauthors = | title = Still a Legend: The Story of Roger Maris | publisher = iUniverse | year = 2002 | location = | pages = | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=LIQLHXQrAssC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq= | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-595-24615-X[/tpl] and neither was Maris, who said that he could not stand Lane.  After Maris broke Babe Ruth's home run record, Lane defended himself by saying he still would have done the deal because Maris was unknown and he received good ballplayers in exchange.
After the Maris trade, Lane acquired 25-year old Norm Cash from the White Sox for Minnie Miñoso and then traded him to Detroit before he ever played a game for the Indians; Cash went on to hit over 350 home runs for the Tigers. The Indians received Steve Demeter in the deal, who would have only five at-bats for Cleveland.[tpl]cite news | last = Dow  | first = Bill | title = Former Tiger Norm Cash  | work = Baseball Digest  | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_9_60/ai_76928886  |date=September 2001 | accessdate = 2006-08-11 [/tpl]

====Curse of Rocky Colavito====

In 1960, Lane made the trade that would define his tenure in Cleveland when he dealt slugging right fielder and fan favorite[tpl]cite book | last =Borsvold | first = David | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Cleveland Indians: Cleveland Press Years, 1920–1982  | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | year =1960 | location = | page =81  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=v0hgrNuScVMC&pg=PA81&dq=%2B%22colavito%22+%2Bfan+%2Bfavorite | doi = | id = | isbn =0-7385-2325-9 [/tpl] Rocky Colavito to the Detroit Tigers for Harvey Kuenn just before Opening Day in [tpl]MLBy|1960[/tpl].
It was a blockbuster trade that swapped the [tpl]MLBy|1959[/tpl] AL home run co-champion (Colavito) for the AL batting champion (Kuenn). After the trade, however, Colavito hit over 30 home runs four times and made three All-Star teams for Detroit and Kansas City before returning to Cleveland in [tpl]MLBy|1965[/tpl]. Kuenn, on the other hand, would play only one season for the Indians before departing for San Francisco in a trade for an aging Johnny Antonelli and Willie Kirkland. Akron Beacon Journal columnist Terry Pluto documented the decades of woe that followed the trade in his book The Curse of Rocky Colavito.[tpl]cite news |first= Steve|last= Gietschier |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= The Curse of Rocky Colavito: A Loving Look at a Thirty-Year Slump. - book reviews |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n17_v217/ai_15355261 |work= The Sporting News|publisher= |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=1994-09-25 |accessdate=2008-06-10 |language= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= [/tpl]  Despite being attached to the curse, Colavito said that he never placed a curse on the Indians but that the trade was prompted by a salary dispute with Lane.[tpl]cite news |first= Stan|last= Grossfeld |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= Colavito Always Straight Shooter |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2007/10/12/colavito_always_straight_shooter/ |work= The Boston Globe|publisher= |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2008-06-29 |language= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= [/tpl]
Lane also engineered a unique trade of managers in mid-season 1960, sending Joe Gordon to the Tigers in exchange for Jimmy Dykes. Lane left the team in 1961, but ill-advised trades continued. In 1965, the Indians traded pitcher Tommy John, who would go on to win 288 games in his career, and 1966 Rookie of the Year Tommy Agee to the White Sox to get Colavito back.

====1969 Move to the East Division====

The 1970s were not much better, with the Indians trading away several future stars, including Graig Nettles, Dennis Eckersley, Buddy Bell and 1971 Rookie of the Year Chris Chambliss,[tpl]cite book | last =Riess | first = Steven  | title = Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball Clubs: Volume 1 | publisher = Univ of South Carolina Press | year = 2006 | location = | page =1067 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ZCcJVZyl5oYC | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-313-32993-1[/tpl] for a number of players who made no impact.[tpl]cite web |title=The 10-best Yankee Trades of All Time |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=list/bestyankeetrades |publisher=ESPN.com |date=2004-03-01[/tpl]
Constant ownership changes did not help the Indians. In 1963, Daley's syndicate sold the team to a group headed by general manager Gabe Paul.  Three years later, Paul sold the Indians to Vernon Stouffer,[tpl]cite news |author=Murray Chass |title=BASEBALL; Demise and Pall Of the Indians |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D91130F931A35754C0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |work=New York Times |date=1991-07-02 |accessdate=2008-02-17[/tpl] of the Stouffer's frozen-food empire. Prior to Stouffer's purchase, the team was rumored to be relocated due to poor attendance. Despite the potential for a financially strong owner, Stouffer had some non-baseball related financial setbacks and, consequently, the team was cash-poor.  In order to solve some financial problems, Stouffer had made an agreement to play a minimum of 30 home games in New Orleans with a view to a possible move there.[tpl]cite news |author=Ron Fimrite |title=Circle The Wagons, Indian Uprising! |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1086136/index.htm |work=Sports Illustrated |date=1972-05-29 |accessdate=2008-02-16[/tpl]  After rejecting an offer from George Steinbrenner and former Indian Al Rosen, Stouffer sold the team in 1972 to a group led by Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland Barons owner Nick Mileti.  Steinbrenner went on to buy the New York Yankees in 1973.[tpl]cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | page =352  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-58261-376-1[/tpl]
Only five years later, Mileti's group sold the team for $11 million to a syndicate headed by trucking magnate Steve O'Neill and including former general manager and owner Gabe Paul.[tpl]cite news |author=Richard Goldstein |title=Gabe Paul, Ex-Yankee Official, Dies at 88 |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E5DC1F3FF93BA15757C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |work=New York Times |date=1998-04-28 |accessdate=2008-02-16[/tpl]  O'Neill's death in 1983 led to the team going on the market once more. His son, Patrick O'Neill, did not find a buyer until real estate magnates Richard and David Jacobs purchased the team in 1986.
The team was unable to move out of the cellar, with losing seasons between 1969 and 1975. One highlight was the acquisition of Gaylord Perry in [tpl]MLBy|1972[/tpl]. The Indians traded fireballer "Sudden Sam" McDowell for Perry, who became the first Indian pitcher to win the Cy Young Award. In [tpl]MLBy|1975[/tpl], Cleveland broke another color barrier with the hiring of Frank Robinson as Major League Baseball's first African American manager. Robinson served as player-manager and would provide a franchise highlight when he hit a pinch hit home run on Opening Day. But the high profile signing of Wayne Garland, a 20-game winner in Baltimore, proved to be a disaster after Garland suffered from shoulder problems and went 28–48 over five years.[tpl]cite book | last = Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | title = More Tales From the Tribe Dugout | publisher = Sports Publishing, LLC | series = | year = 2005  | url= http://books.google.com/?id=2UHG0hiDunkC  | doi = | isbn = 1-58261-680-9 [/tpl] The team failed to improve with Robinson as manager and he was fired in [tpl]MLBy|1977[/tpl]. In 1977, pitcher Dennis Eckersley threw a no-hitter against the California Angels. The next season, he would be dealt to the Boston Red Sox where he won 20 games in 1978 and another 17 in 1979.
The 1970s also featured the infamous Ten Cent Beer Night at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The ill-conceived promotion at a 1974 game against the Texas Rangers ended in a riot by fans and a forfeit by the Indians.[tpl]cite web | last = Jackson | first = Paul | title = The night beer and violence bubbled over in Cleveland | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=beernight/080604&sportCat=mlb | date=2008-06-04 |accessdate = 2009-02-17 [/tpl]
There were more bright spots in the 1980s. In May 1981, Len Barker threw a perfect game against the Toronto Blue Jays, joining Addie Joss as the only other Indian pitcher to do so.[tpl]cite web |author= Anthony Castrovince |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060514&content_id=1453617&vkey=news_cle&fext=.jsp&c_id=cle |title=Barker's special night remains vivid |date=2006-05-15 |accessdate=2008-07-01 |work=MLB.com[/tpl]  "Super Joe" Charbonneau won the American League Rookie of the Year award.

Eventually, the Indians traded Barker to the Atlanta Braves for Brett Butler and Brook Jacoby, who would become mainstays of the team for the remainder of the decade. Butler and Jacoby were joined by Joe Carter, Mel Hall, Julio Franco and Cory Snyder, which brought new hope to fans in the late 1980s.[tpl]cite news |author=Ron Fimrite  |title=Pow!

Cleveland's struggles over the 30-year span were highlighted in the 1989 film Major League, which comically depicted a hapless Cleveland ball club going from worst to first by the end of the film.

====Organizational turnaround====

Throughout the 1980s, the Indians' owners had pushed for a new stadium. Cleveland Stadium had been a symbol of the Indians' glory years in the 1940s and 1950s. However, during the lean years even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the cavernous environment. The old stadium was not aging gracefully; chunks of concrete were falling off in sections and the old wooden pilings now petrified.[tpl]cite news |author=Jon Morgan |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/bal-modell121795,1,3690562.story?page=1 |title=Inside the Browns deal |date=1995-12-17 |accessdate=2008-07-01 |work=Baltimore Sun, reprinted by the Chicago Tribune[/tpl]  In 1984, a proposal for a $150 million domed stadium was defeated in a referendum 2–1.[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E0DE1E38F933A25756C0A962948260 |title=Tax Rise and Domed Stadium Are Voted Down in Cleveland |date=05-10-1984 |accessdate=2008-07-01 |agency=Associated Press | work=The New York Times[/tpl]
Finally, in May 1990, Cuyahoga County voters passed an excise tax on sales of alcohol and cigarettes in the county. The tax proceeds would be used to finance the building of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex which would include Jacobs Field and Gund Arena for the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team.[tpl]cite news |author=Jennifer Stoffel |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DC1F31F930A25755C0A966958260 |title=New Sports Complex for Cleveland |date=1990-06-13 |accessdate=2008-07-01 |work=New York Times[/tpl]  The team had new ownership and a new stadium on the way. They now needed a winning team.
The team's fortunes started to turn in [tpl]By|1989[/tpl], ironically with a very unpopular trade. The team sent power-hitting outfielder Joe Carter to the San Diego Padres for two unproven players, Sandy Alomar, Jr. and Carlos Baerga. Alomar made an immediate impact, not only being elected to the All-Star team but also winning Cleveland's fourth Rookie of the Year award and a Gold Glove. Baerga would become a three-time All-Star with consistent offensive production.
Indians general manager John Hart made a number of moves that would finally bring success to the team. In [tpl]MLBy|1991[/tpl], he hired former Indian Mike Hargrove to manage and traded catcher Eddie Taubensee to the Houston Astros who, with a surplus of outfielders, were willing to part with Kenny Lofton. Lofton finished second in AL Rookie of the Year balloting with a .285 average and 66 stolen bases.
The Indians were named "Organization of the Year" by Baseball America[tpl]cite web |title=The Official Site of The Cleveland Indians: History: Indians History |url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/cle/history/cle_history_overview.jsp?story=5 |publisher=Major League Baseball, Cleveland Indians |accessdate=2009-02-17[/tpl] in 1992, in response to the appearance of offensive bright spots and an improving farm system.
The team suffered a tragedy during spring training of [tpl]MLBy|1993[/tpl], when a boat carrying pitchers Steve Olin, Tim Crews, and Bob Ojeda crashed into a pier. Olin and Crews were killed, and Ojeda was seriously injured. (Ojeda missed most of the season, and would retire the following year).[tpl]cite web |author=Jayson Stark |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1527339&type=columnist |title=Ten years later, the pain is still there |date=2003-03-21 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |work=ESPN.com[/tpl]
By the end of the 1993 season, the team was in transition, leaving Cleveland Stadium and fielding a talented nucleus of young players. Many of those players came from the Indians' new AAA farm team, the Charlotte Knights, who won the International League title that year.

===1994–2000: New beginnings===

====1994: Jacobs Field opens====

Indians General Manager John Hart and team owner Richard Jacobs managed to turn the team's fortunes around. The Indians opened Jacobs Field in 1994 with the aim of improving on the prior season's sixth-place finish. The Indians were only one game behind the division-leading Chicago White Sox on August 12 when a players strike wiped out the rest of the season.

====1995 season: first Pennant since 1954====

Having contended for the division in the aborted 1994 season, Cleveland sprinted to a 100–44 record (18 games were lost to player/owner negotiations) in 1995 winning its first ever divisional title. Veterans Dennis Martínez, Orel Hershiser and Eddie Murray combined with a young core of players including Albert Belle, Jim Thome, Manny Ramírez and Charles Nagy to lead the league in team batting average as well as team ERA.
After defeating the Boston Red Sox in the Division Series and the Seattle Mariners in the ALCS, Cleveland clinched a World Series berth, for the first time since 1954. The World Series ended in disappointment with the Indians falling in six games to the Atlanta Braves.

====1996====

The Indians repeated as AL Central champions in 1996, but lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the Division Series. Notably in 1996, tickets for every home game for the Indians sold out before opening day.

====1997: Two outs away====

In 1997 Cleveland started slow but finished with an 86–75 record. Taking their third consecutive AL Central title, the Indians defeated the New York Yankees in the Division Series, 3–2. After defeating the Baltimore Orioles in the ALCS, Cleveland went on to face the Florida Marlins in the World Series which featured the coldest game in World Series history. With the series tied after Game Six, the Indians went into the ninth inning of Game Seven with a 2–1 lead, but closer José Mesa allowed the Marlins to tie the game. In the eleventh inning, Edgar Rentería drove in the winning run giving the Marlins their first championship.  Cleveland became the first team to lose the World Series after carrying the lead into the ninth inning of the seventh game.

====1998–2001====

In 1998, the Indians made the playoffs for the fourth straight year. After defeating the wild-card Boston Red Sox 3-1 in the Division Series, Cleveland lost the 1998 ALCS in six games to the New York Yankees, who had come into the playoffs with a then-AL record 114 wins in the regular season.[tpl]cite news |title=No work Yankees |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/1998/postseason/news/1998/10/14/series_yankees/ |work=Sports Illustrated |date=1998-10-15 |accessdate=2008-09-08[/tpl]
For the 1999 season, Cleveland added relief pitcher Ricardo Rincón and second baseman Roberto Alomar, brother of catcher Sandy Alomar, Jr,[tpl]cite news |first=Ros|last=Newhan |title=Early Returns Favor Braves|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/29/sports/sp-48911 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1998-11-29 |accessdate=2008-09-08[/tpl] and won the Central Division title for the fifth consecutive year. The team scored 1,009 runs, becoming the first (and to date only) team since the 1950 Boston Red Sox to score more than 1,000 runs in a season. This time, Cleveland did not make it past the first round, losing the Division Series to the Red Sox, despite taking a 2-0 lead in the series.

In 2000, the Indians had a 44–42 start, but caught fire after the All Star break and went 46–30 the rest of the way to finish 90–72. The team had one of the league's best offenses that year and a defense that yielded three gold gloves. However, they ended up five games behind the Chicago White Sox in the Central division and missed the wild card by one game to the Seattle Mariners. Mid-season trades brought Bob Wickman and Jake Westbrook to Cleveland.  After the season and free agent outfielder Manny Ramírez departed for the Boston Red Sox.
In 2000, Larry Dolan bought the Indians for $320 million from Richard Jacobs, who, along with his late brother David, had paid $45 million for the club in 1986. The sale set a record at the time for the sale of a baseball franchise.[tpl]cite web |title=Cleveland Indians sold to Dolan|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/-cleveland-indians-sold-dolan/story.aspx?guid=%7B30D9D583-27E3-4DC4-88E4-46E59CB9252B%7D|work=CBS Marketwatch |date=1999-11-04 |accessdate=2008-09-08[/tpl]
2001 saw a return to the playoffs. After the departures of Ramírez and Sandy Alomar, Jr., the Indians signed Ellis Burks and former MVP Juan González, who helped the team win the Central division with a 91–71 record.  One of the highlights came on August 5, when the Indians completed the biggest comeback in MLB History. Cleveland rallied to close a 14–2 deficit in the seventh inning to defeat the Seattle Mariners 15–14 in 11 innings. The Mariners, who won a MLB record-tying 116 games that season, had a strong bullpen, and Indians manager Charlie Manuel had already pulled many of his starters with the game seemingly out of reach.
Seattle and Cleveland met in the first round of the playoffs, however the Mariners won the series 3-2. In the 2001-02 offseason, GM John Hart resigned and his assistant, Mark Shapiro, took the reins.

===2002–2010: The Shapiro/Wedge years===

====First "rebuilding of the team"====

Shapiro moved to rebuild by dealing aging veterans for younger talent. He traded Roberto Alomar to the New York Mets for a package that included outfielder Matt Lawton and prospects Alex Escobar and Billy Traber. When the team fell out of contention in mid-[tpl]MLBy|2002[/tpl], Shapiro fired manager Charlie Manuel and traded pitching ace Bartolo Colón for prospects Brandon Phillips, Cliff Lee, and Grady Sizemore; acquired Travis Hafner from the Rangers for Ryan Drese and Einar Díaz; and picked up Coco Crisp from the St. Louis Cardinals for aging starter Chuck Finley. Jim Thome left after the season, going to the Phillies for a larger contract.
Young Indians teams finished far out of contention in 2002 and [tpl]MLBy|2003[/tpl] under new manager Eric Wedge. They posted strong offensive numbers in [tpl]MLBy|2004[/tpl], but continued to struggle with a bullpen that blew more than 20 saves. A highlight of the season was a 22–0 victory over the New York Yankees on August 31, one of the worst defeats suffered by the Yankees in team history.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=240831110 |title=Vizquel's six hits tie AL record |accessdate=2008-06-08 |publisher=ESPN |date=2004-08-31[/tpl]
In early [tpl]MLBy|2005[/tpl], the offense got off to a poor start. After a brief July slump, the Indians caught fire in August, and cut a 15.5 game deficit in the Central Division down to 1.5 games. However, the season came to an end as the Indians went on to lose six of their last seven games, five of them by one run, missing the playoffs by only two games. Shapiro was named Executive of the Year in 2005.http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/1194342071241541.xml&coll=2 The next season, the club made several roster changes, while retaining its nucleus of young players. The off-season was highlighted by the acquisition of top prospect Andy Marte from the Boston Red Sox.  The Indians had a solid offensive season, led by career years from Travis Hafner and Grady Sizemore. Hafner, despite missing the last month of the season, tied the single season grand slam record of six, which was set in [tpl]MLBy|1987[/tpl] by Don Mattingly.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E2DC173EF937A2575BC0A9609C8B63|title=BASEBALL; Hafner's 6th Grand Slam Ties Mattingly |date=2006-08-14|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-20[/tpl] Despite the solid offensive performance, the bullpen struggled with 23 blown saves (a Major League worst), and the Indians finished a disappointing fourth.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/mlb031/11405274/detail.html|title=Cleveland Indians 2007 Preview|last=Ruddick|first=Chris|date=2007-03-27|publisher=News Net 5|accessdate=2009-03-21[/tpl]
In [tpl]MLBy|2007[/tpl], Shapiro signed veteran help for the bullpen and outfield in the offseason.

The Indians began their playoff run by defeating the New York Yankees in the American League Division Series three games to one. This series will be most remembered for the swarm of bugs that overtook the field in the later innings of Game Two. They also jumped out to a three-games-to-one lead over the Red Sox in the American League Championship Series. The season ended in disappointment when Boston swept the final three games to advance to the 2007 World Series.
Despite the loss, Cleveland players took home a number of awards. Grady Sizemore, who had a .995 fielding percentage and only two errors in 405 chances, won the Gold Glove award, Cleveland's first since 2001.[tpl]cite news|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071106&content_id=2293684&vkey=news_cle&fext=.jsp&c_id=cle|title=Sizemore earns first Gold Glove Award|last=Castrovince|first=Anthony|date=2007-11-06|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=2009-03-20[/tpl] Indians Pitcher CC Sabathia won the second Cy Young Award in team history with a 19–7 record, a 3.21 ERA and an MLB-leading 241 innings pitched.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3108321|title=Sabathia only second Indians pitcher to win Cy Young|date=2007-11-14|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2009-03-21[/tpl] Eric Wedge was awarded the first Manager of the Year Award in team history.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/story/2007/11/14/baseball-managers.html?ref=rss|title=Wedge, Melvin voted baseball's top managers|date=2007-11-14|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2009-03-20[/tpl] Shapiro was named to his second Executive of the Year in 2007.

On January 18, 2011, longtime popular former first baseman and manager Mike Hargrove was brought in as a special adviser. The Indians started the 2011 season strong - going 30-15 in their first 45 games and seven games ahead of the Detroit Tigers for first place. Injuries led to a slump where the Indians fell out of first place.

==Season-by-season results==

==Rivalries==

===Interleague===

The Ohio Cup was an annual pre-season baseball game, which pitted the Ohio rivals Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds.
In its first series it was a single-game cup, played each year at minor-league Cooper Stadium in Columbus, Ohio, and was staged just days before the start of each new Major League Baseball season. A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, in 1989 to 1996, with the Indians winning six of them. It stopped because interleague play started in 1997. The winner of the game each year was awarded the Ohio Cup in postgame ceremonies. The Ohio Cup was a favorite among baseball fans in Columbus, with attendances regularly topping 15,000.
In 1997 and after, the two teams competed annually in the regular-season Battle of Ohio/Buckeye Series.  In 2008 the Ohio Cup restarted.  The Indians lead the interleague series 44-41.  The two clubs have played six games against each other every season through 2012, featuring a three game series in each city.  Beginning in 2013, the Indians and Reds will only play four games against each other, two in each city.
The Indians also have had an on-and-off rivalry with the Pittsburgh Pirates, as the two teams have played an annual three game series during interleague play in June from 1997-2001, and again from 2009-12.  This rivalry stems from the close proximity of the two cities, and features some carryover elements from the longstanding rivalry from the two cities' NFL teams (Browns and Steelers).  Beginning in 2013, the Indians and Pirates will only play each other every third season (when the AL Central plays the NL Central), as MLB assigned each team one "permanent rival."  The Indians' assigned rival is the Reds.

===Divisional===

As the Indians play 19 games every year with their A.L. Central competitors, several rivalries have developed.
The Indians have a rivalry with the Detroit Tigers due to the fact that the two cities are fairly close to each other, the teams have been battling for the A.L. Central championship in recent years, and has some carryover elements from the Ohio State-Michigan rivalry.
The Indians have had an on and off rivalry with the Chicago White Sox since the 1959 season (when the Sox slipped past the Tribe to win the A.L. pennant), and has intensified since both clubs moved to the A.L. Central.  Probably the most infamous moment in the White Sox rivalry was in 1994 when the White Sox confiscated Albert Belle's corked bat, and the ensuing attempt by Indians pitcher Jason Grimsley to crawl through the Comiskey Park (now U.S. Cellular Field) clubhouse ceiling to retrieve it. Belle later moved to the White Sox in 1997, making the rivalry even more intense.
The Indians also have a divisional rivalry with the Kansas City Royals, mainly due to numerous bench clearing brawls in the recent past.  The rivalry has intensified when Indians closer Chris Perez used WWE star John Cena's signature "You can't see me" hand gesture towards KC outfielder Jarrod Dyson after striking him out in a game on May 28, 2012.

==Uniforms==

The Indians' home uniform is white with navy piping around each sleeve. Across the front of the jersey in script font is the word "Indians" in red with a navy outline. The jersey has the Chief Wahoo logo on the left sleeve. The home cap is navy blue with a red bill and features the Chief Wahoo logo on the front.
The road uniform is gray, with "Cleveland" in navy blue block letters trimmed in red is across the front of the jersey, navy blue piping around the sleeves, and the Chief Wahoo logo located on the left sleeve. The road cap is navy blue with a red block "C" on the front.
The alternate home uniform is cream colored with "Indians" across the front in red block lettering with a dark navy blue outline. The Chief Wahoo logo is located on the left sleeve. This jersey is the only Indians jersey to not have the players' names on the back. The alternate home cap is red with a navy blue block "C" on the front. This uniform is worn during weekend and holiday home games.
The alternate road jersey is navy blue with white piping around each sleeve. Script "Indians" is located across the front of the jersey in the same fashion as the home uniform (red lettering with a white outline); the Chief Wahoo logo is on the left sleeve. The alternate road cap is navy blue with the Chief Wahoo logo on the front. The blue jersey is also worn during Tuesday home games with the standard home cap.
For all games, the team will use a navy blue batting helmet with a red block "C" on the front.Indians To Go With Just Block “C” On Batting Helmets For 2013 Season « CBS Cleveland

===Sellout streak===

Between June 12, 1995 and April 4, 2001, the Indians sold out 455 consecutive home games, drawing a total of 19,324,248 fans to Jacobs Field. The demand for tickets was so great that all 81 home games were sold out before Opening Day on at least three separate occasions. The sellout streak set a Major League Baseball record; this was broken by the Boston Red Sox on September 8, 2008, though Boston's Fenway Park is considerably smaller than Progressive Field.[tpl]cite web |url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20080908&content_id=3440276&vkey=pr_bos&fext=.jsp&c_id=bos |title=Red Sox fans break MLB record for most consecutive sellouts |accessdate=February 9, 2009 |date=September 8, 2008 |publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.[/tpl] One night after the streak ended, the Indians honored the fans by retiring the number 455.

==Nickname and logo controversy==

The club nickname and its cartoon logo have been criticized for perpetuating Native American stereotypes. In 1997 and 1998, protesters were arrested after effigies were burned. Charges were dismissed in the 1997 case, and were not filed in the 1998 case. Protesters arrested in the 1998 incident subsequently fought and lost a lawsuit alleging that their First Amendment rights had been violated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://courttv.com/archive/verdicts/bellecourt.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012183735/http://courttv.com/archive/verdicts/bellecourt.html |archivedate=2007-10-12 |title=court TV becomes truTV |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2013-01-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.workers.org/ww/1997/cleveland1106.html |title=Workers World Nov. 6, 1997: Native leaders arrested during World Series |publisher=Workers.org |date=1997-11-06 |accessdate=2013-01-23[/tpl][ref]
