The Church at Auvers is an oil painting created by Dutch post-impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh in June 1890 which now hangs in the Musée_d'Orsay in Paris, France. The actual church is in Place de l'Eglise, Auvers-sur-Oise, France, 27km northwest of Paris.

==History==

The Church at Auvers — along with other canvases such as The Town Hall at Auvers and several paintings of small houses with thatched roofs — is reminiscent of scenes from the northern landscapes of his childhood and youth.Lubin, Stranger on the earth: A psychological biography of Vincent van Gogh, Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1972. ISBN 0-03-091352-7, page 230.  A certain nostalgia for the north had already been apparent in his last weeks at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence: in a letter written a couple of weeks before his departure, he wrote "While I was ill I nevertheless did some little canvases from memory which you will see later, memories of the North"Letter 629, 30 April 1890
He specifically refers to similar work done back at Nuenen when he describes this painting in a letter to his sister Wilhelmina on 5 June 1890:
The "simple deep blue" was also used in Portrait of Adeline Ravoux, painted in the same short period in Auvers-sur-Oise.
The foreground of The Church at Auvers is brightly lit by the sun, but the church itself sits in its own shadow, and "neither reflects nor emanates any light of its own."Erickson, Kathleen Powers. At Eternity's Gate: The Spiritual Vision of Vincent van Gogh, 1998, ISBN 0-8028-4978-4. Page 171. After Van Gogh had been dismissed from the evangelical career he had hoped to continue in the Borinage, Belgium, he wrote to his brother Theo from Cuesmes in July 1880, and quoted Shakespeare's image from Henry IV, Part 1"And I have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I am a peppercorn, a brewer’s horse: the inside of a church!" — Act 3, Scene iii. of the dark emptiness inside a church to symbolize "empty and unenlightened preaching":Erickson, page 172 "Their God is like the God of Shakespeare's drunken Falstaff, 'the inside of a church'"Letter 133
The motif of diverging paths also appears in his painting Wheat Field with Crows.

==In popular culture==

The Church at Auvers plays a prominent role in "Vincent and the Doctor", the tenth episode of the fifth series of the revived science-fiction television programme Doctor Who in 2010. In it, the painting depicts a strange, griffin-esque creature (called a "krafayis") at a window of the church, which signifies to the show's time-travelling protagonist, the Doctor, that something evil was lurking in Auvers-sur-Oise in June 1890. Only when van Gogh himself, played by Tony Curran, defeats the creature at the church, does the painting revert to its original, unaltered, state. The krafayis is later revealed to have been blind, with blindness to the colors and shapes of the world and sky (as Vincent saw them) being a recurring theme of the episode.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.denofgeek.com/television/500159/doctor_who_series_5_episode_10_review_vincent_and_the_doctor.html|title= Doctor Who series 5 episode 10 review: Vincent And The Doctor|author= John Moore|date= 5 June 2010|work= Den of Geek|publisher= |accessdate=6 June 2010[/tpl]
