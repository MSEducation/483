Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is a wildlife refuge in New York City that is managed by the National Park Service as part of Gateway National Recreation Area.
It is composed of the open water and intertidal salt marshes of Jamaica Bay.  It lies entirely within the boundaries of New York City, divided between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. It is near John F. Kennedy International Airport, which was built upon a portion of the wetlands in Jamaica Bay.  In April 1942, the City of New York started placing hydraulic fill over the marshy tidelands of the area.[tpl]cite web|title=History of JFK International Airport|url=http://www.panynj.gov/airports/jfk-history.html|publisher=The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|accessdate=3 October 2013[/tpl]  JFK International Airport is now the sixth busiest airport in the United States with 125 gates serving over 70 airlines[tpl]cite web|title=(JFK) John F.

The refuge provides habitat for a wide variety of flora and fauna, both marine and terrestrial.  It is a prime location for viewing birds and bird migrations, diamondback turtle egg-laying and horseshoe crab mating and egg laying.  The primary diet of the Diamondback terrapins include fish, snails, worms, clams, crabs and marsh plants, many of which are abundant in these particular marshlands.[tpl]cite web|title=Diamondback Terrapin|url=https://www.defenders.org/diamondback-terrapin/basic-facts|publisher=Defenders of Wildlife|accessdate=3 October 2013[/tpl]  Ospreys are currently being captured, tagged and studied in the Wildlife Refuge to help scientists better understand the birds' habits.[tpl]cite news|last=Foderaro|first=Lisa|title=An Earth-Bound View Of Where Ospreys Soar.|accessdate=4 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 May 2012[/tpl]  Small mammals such as Eastern Gray Squirrels[tpl]cite journal|last=Huynh|first=Howard|coauthors=Williams, Geoffrey; McAlpine, Donald; Thorington, Richard|title=Establishment of the Eastern Gray Squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) in Nova Scotia, Canada|journal=Northeastern Naturalist|date=December 2010|volume=17|issue=4|pages=673–677|accessdate=3 October 2013|doi=10.1656/045.017.0414[/tpl]  and raccoon[tpl]cite journal|last=Burke|first=Russell|coauthors=Felice, Susan; Sobel, Sabrina|title=Changes in Raccoon (Procyon lotor) Predation Behavior Affects Turtle (Malaclemys terrapin) Nest Census.|journal=Chelonian Conservation & Biology|date=December 2009|volume=8|issue=2|pages=208–211|accessdate=October 3, 2013|doi=10.2744/ccb-0775.1[/tpl]  are also present in the area.  The recently increased raccoon population however has developed a taste for diamondback turtle eggs and many nests are often destroyed only 24 hours after being laid.[tpl]cite news|last=Newman|first=Andy|title=Turtle Soup?

It is the only "wildlife refuge" in the National Park System. Originally created and managed by New York City as a wildlife refuge, the term was retained by Gateway when the site was transferred in 1972. Usually, federal wildlife refuges are managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Features created under city ownership include two large freshwater ponds. A  visitor center with a parking lot provides free permits to walk the trails.Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge New York Harbor Parks
