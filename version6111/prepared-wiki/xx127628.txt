==Caveat Emptor==

Each volume of Dick's Picks has its own "caveat emptor" label, advising the listener of the sound quality of the recording.  The label for Volume 3 reads:
"This show was originally recorded on analog tape manufactured in the late 1970s. Many tapes from this period have exhibited severe deterioration in recent years. The chemical formulation has failed over time, causing the magnetic oxide (which holds the musical information) to separate from the mylar backing. Fortunately we were able to recover the music on these tapes by using a baking process which rebonded the oxide to the tape. While the results of this restoration were quite remarkable, occasional weirdness remains."
