Blacktronic Science is the third solo album by former Parliament-Funkadelic keyboardist Bernie Worrell. The album was released by Gramavision records in 1993 and was produced by Bill Laswell and Bernie Worrell. The album represents a P-Funk reunion of sorts, as it features guest appearances by George Clinton, bassist Bootsy Collins, trombonist Fred Wesley, saxophonist Maceo Parker and P-Funk vocalist Gary Cooper. It would also be the last album that Bernie Worrell would record for the Gramavision label.
