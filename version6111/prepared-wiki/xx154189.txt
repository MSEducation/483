CATEGORIES: Elsinoë, Plant pathogens and diseases

Elsinoë australis is a plant pathogen that causes sweet orange scab. The disease only attacks the fruit of citrus trees, causing the formation of pustules and lesions on the skin of the fruit. The spores of the fungus are spread from tree to tree by rain splash. It can be controlled by the use of various fungicides including strobulins and thiophanate methyl.[tpl]cite web |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/PP147 |title=Citrus Diseases Exotic to Florida: Sweet Orange Scab (SOS) |accessdate=2008-08-01 |last=Chung |first=K.
