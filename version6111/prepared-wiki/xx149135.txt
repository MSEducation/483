===TSV 1860 München===

Recruited from the Cape Town based club Hellenic F.C. at age 15 by TSV 1860 München, Lance Davids is a youth product of the Bavarian club to which he transferred in 2001. He made his debut in the German 2. Bundesliga in the 2004–05 season, playing for TSV 1860 München making 21 league appearances before transferring to the Swedish Djurgårdens IF from Stockholm.

===Djurgården IF===

Davids came to Djurgårdens IF from TSV 1860 München in Germany at the start of the 2006 season, but had a tough time establishing himself as a starter at the beginning of the season.

During the 2007 season, Davids played on the right as a midfielder or as a defender.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.kickoff.com/static/news/article.php?id=555 | title=Player ratings vs Canada | publisher=Kickoff.com | first = Nick | last = Said | accessdate= 2 January 2008 | date = 20 November 2007[/tpl]
