Rufus Rivers Meadows (born August 25, 1907 in Chase City, Virginia) was a left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds in 1926. He appeared in just one game, an 18-1 loss to the Chicago Cubs. Meadows faced the Cubs' final batter of the game, inducing an out to finish off the blowout loss by his Reds. He holds the record for facing the fewest batters by a pitcher who played only one MLB game.[tpl]cite web|title=Baseball-Reference|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/friv/coffee.shtml|work=Cup of Coffee Pitchers|accessdate=1 May 2012[/tpl] He also batted once in the game and did not reach base, finishing with a lifetime batting average of .000 to match his lifetime ERA of 0.00. 
Meadows was only 18 when he had his brief moment as a major leaguer, and he was the second-youngest player to play in the National League that season, trailing only future Hall of Famer Mel Ott.
Meadows died May 10, 1970 in Wichita, Kansas.
