The World Championship of Drivers was contested over a nine race series which commenced on 17 January and ended on 24 October 1954.

==Championship summary==

With Formula One changing to 2.5 litre unsupercharged engines for 1954, Mercedes re-entered grand prix racing for the first time since the Second World War at the French Grand Prix with a streamlined single seater which Fangio and Karl Kling took to a dominating 1–2 win. Fangio's French success had come after switching from the Maserati team with whom he had won the first two Grands Prix of the season.  Although the streamlined, closed-wheel body proved unsuitable for Silverstone, Mercedes produced a more conventional open-wheel body for the Nürburgring and Fangio won three of the remaining four races.
Reigning champion Alberto Ascari had a less successful switch of teams, choosing to leave Ferrari for the newly formed Lancia team. Unfortunately for him, Lancia's car, the D50, was not ready until the final World Championship race, meaning he had to sit out most of his title defence.
Championship points were awarded for first five places in each race on an 8, 6, 4, 3, 2 basis with 1 point awarded for the fastest lap.Mike Lang, Grand Prix!, Volume 1 1950 to 1965, Haynes Publishing Group, 1981, page 7 Only the best five of nine scores counted towards the championship.Mike Lang, Grand Prix!, Volume 1 1950 to 1965, Haynes Publishing Group, 1981, page 80 Points for shared drives were divided equally between the drivers, regardless of who had driven more laps unless one of the drivers was deemed to have completed "insufficient distance". Drivers who shared more than one car during a race received points only for their highest finish.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
