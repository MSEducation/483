Jeffrey D. Sharples (born July 28, 1967 in Terrace, British Columbia) is a retired Canadian ice hockey defenceman who played 105 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Detroit Red Wings.  He was a second round selection of the Red Wings, 29th overall, at the 1985 NHL Entry Draft and made his NHL debut late in the 1986–87 NHL season.  He spent the majority of two seasons with the Red Wings until he was traded to the Edmonton Oilers on November 2, 1989.  He never appeared in a regular-season game with Edmonton; his only action with the team was in an exhibition game against the Soviet club team, Khimik Voskresensk. Sharples spent most of the 1989–90 AHL season with the Cape Breton Oilers before he was again traded, this time to the New Jersey Devils on March 6, 1990.  Sharples played ten more seasons in the minor leagues but never played in the NHL again.  He retired in 2000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=11487 |title=Jeff Sharples player profile |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl]
