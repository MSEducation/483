Following the 2002 general election Harney led the Progressive Democrats, who had doubled their seats from four to eight, back into coalition with Fianna Fáil, the first time a government had been re-elected since 1969. She was re-appointed Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In a government reshuffle on 29 September 2004, she was appointed Minister for Health and Children.
Harney was Ireland's representative to the European Council of Ministers for the Software Patents Directive.At a time when Ireland held the rotating Presidency of the European Union Since the Council's first reading fell during the Irish Presidency of the European Council, she was chair of the meeting that discarded the amendments by the European Parliament which confirmed the exclusion of software innovations from what constitutes patentable subject matter.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
In December 2001, Harney used a Government plane,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2002/0117/aircorps.html|title=Tánaiste stands over use of Air Corps aircraft|work=RTÉ News|date=17 January 2002[/tpl] 50% funded by the European Commission, to travel to County Leitrim to open a friend's off-licence in Manorhamilton. Harney later apologised for having abused her position in using the plane for non-government business and admitted that using the plane was wrong. The aircraft was to be used 90% of the time exclusively for maritime surveillance.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&si=673919&issue_id=6744|title=Harney's humble pie over plane 'outrage'|work=Irish Independent|date=19 January 2002[/tpl]
In May 2006, the Irish Nurses Organisation unanimously passed a motion of no confidence in Mary Harney, accusing her of being negative and antagonistic towards nurses.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0505/nurses.html|title=INO passes vote of no confidence in Harney|work=RTÉ News|date=5 May 2006[/tpl] Her policy of transferring private beds in public hospitals to privately operated hospitals has also attracted criticism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tascnet.ie/upload/Connor%20Sunday%20Business%20Post,%20Aug%2028th%202005.pdf|title=The regressive nature of Mary Harney's proposals leaves them open to abuse|author=Tom O'Connor|work=Sunday Business Post|date=28 August 2005[/tpl]
In March 2006, 16 months after she took office as health minister, the INO claimed that a record number of 455 people were waiting on hospital trolleys on one day (although the Health Service Executive gave a figure of 363 people waiting on hospital trolleys for the same day).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0307/trolleys.html|title=Dispute over A&E trolley counts|work=RTÉ News|date=7 March 2006[/tpl] In June 2006, the Health Consumer Powerhouse ranked the Irish health service as the second least "consumer-friendly" in the European Union and Switzerland, coming 25th out of 26 countries, ahead of Lithuania.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=133&si=1641366&issue_id=14261|title=Our health service is the shame of Europe|work=Irish Independent|date=27 June 2006[/tpl] However, in the same survey conducted a year later, the Irish health service showed significant improvement, coming 16th out of 29 countries. Ireland even scored higher than Britain's NHS which came 17th in the survey.
In July 2006, Ireland on Sunday reported that Mary Harney's mother, Mrs Sarah Harney, jumped a queue of two emergency cases to receive hip surgery at The Adelaide and Meath Hospital in Tallaght. The allegation was strongly denied by the minister.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0731/harneym.html|title=Tánaiste reacts angrily to mother story|work=RTÉ News|date=31 July 2006[/tpl] Sixty percent of respondents to an Irish Times/TNS mrbi poll in December 2006 said that the appointment of Harney to the position of Minister for Health had not led to any improvement in the health service. Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Harney's own Progressive Democrats supporters were those who expressed most satisfaction with people in Dublin also feeling most dissatisfaction regionally.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/?jp=CWIDQLSNSNKF|title=Majority unhappy with Harney's performance in Health|work=Breakingnews.ie|date=5 December 2006[/tpl] Harney rejected criticisms from Fine Gael during the same month that there had been a 25% increase in people waiting on trolleys in regional hospitals during the past two years; she claimed Health Service Executive statistics showed otherwise.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1205/hospitals.html|title=Harney rejects claims over A&E|work=RTÉ News|date=5 December 2006[/tpl]
In July and August 2006, she issued three orders exempting two new community nursing units, to be built at St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park, from the usual legally required planning permission, despite the Park being a designated and protected national monument. The Department of Health said the decision was made because of what it called the department's "emergency response to the accident and emergency crisis at the time", although the nursing units, in use since 2008, are mainly for geriatric care.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0518/1224246810397.html|title=Harney exempted Phoenix Park plan|work=The Irish Times|date=5 May 2009|accessdate=11 August 2010[/tpl]
The same year, in her capacity as Minister for Health, Mary Harney introduced risk equalisation into the Irish healthcare market. This was hugely resisted by BUPA. However, despite High Court proceedings, the controversial law was upheld. This forced BUPA out of the Irish healthcare market (BUPA Ireland was since bought by the Irish owned Quinn Group, averting any fear of redundancies). In January 2007, a leaked memo said that the planned Cancer Care Strategy, due for completion in 2011, would not be delivered on time. Harney denied this and said that since the leaking of the memo there had been much progress, although she did not elaborate. The plan was to allow for nationwide radiotherapy services by 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0119/cancer.html|title=Harney defends cancer care strategy timescale|work=RTÉ News|date=19 January 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/?jp=CWSNEYKFIDOJ|title=Kenny: Govt's cancer-treatment delays a 'hoax'|work=Breakingnews.ie|date=19 January 2007[/tpl]

===Resignation as party leader===

On 7 September 2006, Mary Harney announced that she was resigning as leader of the Progressive Democrats and that she would remain leader until a successor was chosen. She said she wanted to continue as Minister for Health[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0907/harneym.html|title=Harney steps down as leader of PDs|work=RTÉ News|date=7 September 2006[/tpl] but stated that it was a matter for her successor and the Taoiseach. She was succeeded by then Justice Minister Michael McDowell after Tom Parlon and backbencher Liz O'Donnell nominated him.

===2007 election aftermath===

Following the poor performance of the Progressive Democrats at the 2007 general election in which the party lost 6 of its 8 seats, including that of party leader Michael McDowell, Harney resumed her role as party leader. The Progressive Democrats' rules at the time stipulated that the leader of the party must be a TD, and since Harney was one of only two remaining TDs, she resumed the leadership in a caretaker capacity. Following a rule change that broadened the eligibility, she was succeeded by Senator Ciarán Cannon as party leader on 17 April 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/0417/breaking3.htm|title=Cannon elected leader of the Progressive Democrats|work=Irish Times|date=17 April 2008|accessdate=17 April 2008[/tpl]

====FÁS expenditure controversy====

It emerged in November 2008, that Harney personally requested the use of the Government jet for a FÁS trip to Florida in 2004, at a cost of up to €80,000 to taxpayers. She travelled to Florida with senior FÁS executives, department officials, and her husband, Brian Geoghegan, and was receiving more than €100-a-day subsistence money from the taxpayer when FÁS picked up her hairdressing bill in a Florida hotel. Like all government ministers travelling abroad, she was entitled to a daily allowance for "incidental expenses".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/revealed-skyhigh-cost-of-fas-florida-trip-1556226.html|title=Revealed: sky-high cost of FAS Florida trip|work=Irish Independent|date=28 November 2008|accessdate=28 November 2008[/tpl]
In a RTÉ Radio 1 interview on 27 November 2008, Fianna Fáil TD Mary O'Rourke described Harney's involvement in the scandal as "a load of hoo-hah". On 28 November 2008, Harney defended her use of expenses while on a FÁS trip to the US, saying that she was "not on holiday", had not used public taxes for her own personal grooming, said the use of the government jet for the trip was made by the Taoiseach, and had followed advice in claiming her expenses. She acknowledged meeting a relative for an hour while in the United States. The Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore told his party conference that Harney should resign because of her performance as Minister for Health.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1128/fas.html|title=Harney defends FÁS trip expenses|work=RTÉ News|date=28 November 2008|accessdate=28 November 2008[/tpl]
