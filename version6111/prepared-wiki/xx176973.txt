==Injury==

In 2008 the club doctor for FC Thun announced that, though it had already been operated on for a torn ACL and cartilage damage, his knee would probably no longer permit a professional career. Because of this, at the age of 25 Zahnd was forced to retire from professional football due to his extensive knee injury and an associated osteoarthritis.http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/sport/fussball/Das-Knie-spielt-nicht-mehr-mit/story/25012337
