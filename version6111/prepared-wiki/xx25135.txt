Poverty  is  general scarcity or dearth, or the state of one who lacks a certain amount of material possessions or money.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poverty|title=Poverty|publisher=merriam-webster|accessdate=2013-11-18[/tpl] Absolute poverty or destitution refers to the deprivation of basic human needs, which commonly includes food, water, sanitation, clothing, shelter, health care and education.

After the industrial revolution, mass production in factories made production goods increasingly less expensive and more accessible.  Of more importance is the modernization of agriculture, such as fertilizers, to provide enough yield to feed the population.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/europe/09food.html|title=Obama enlists major powers to aid poor farmers with $15 billion|work=The New York Times |accessdate=2011-05-27|first1=Peter|last1=Baker|first2=Celia W.|last2=Dugger|date=9 July 2009[/tpl] The supply of basic needs can be restricted by constraints on government services such as corruption, tax avoidance, debt and loan conditionalities and by the brain drain of health care and educational professionals. Strategies of increasing income to make basic needs more affordable typically include welfare, economic freedoms, and providing financial services.
Poverty reduction is a major goal and issue for many international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank. The World Bank estimated 1.29 billion people were living in absolute poverty in 2008. Of these, about 400 million people in absolute poverty lived in India and 173 million people in China. In terms of percentage of regional populations, sub-Saharan Africa at 47% had the highest incidence rate of absolute poverty in 2008. Between 1990 and 2010, about 663 million people moved above the absolute poverty level. Still, extreme poverty is a global challenge; it is observed in all parts of the world, including developed economies.[tpl]cite web|title=World Bank Sees Progress Against Extreme Poverty, But Flags Vulnerabilities|publisher=The World bank|date=February 29, 2012|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/02/29/world-bank-sees-progress-against-extreme-poverty-but-flags-vulnerabilities[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/country/IND |title=Poverty and Equity - India, 2010 World Bank Country Profile |publisher=Povertydata.worldbank.org |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2013-07-26[/tpl] UNICEF estimates half the worlds children (or 1.1 billion) live in poverty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/rightsite/364_617.htm|author=Ernest C.

==Etymology==

The word poverty comes from old French poverté (Modern French: pauvreté), from Latin paupertās, from pauper (poor).[tpl]cite book|title=An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language|author=Walter Skeat|year=2005|isbn=978-0486440521|publisher=Dover Publications[/tpl]
The English word "poverty" via Anglo-Norman povert.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] There are several definitions of poverty depending on the context of the situation it is placed in, and the views of the person giving the definition.

==Measuring poverty==

===Definitions===

United Nations: Fundamentally, poverty is the inability of getting choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity. It means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It means not having enough to feed and clothe a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one’s food or a job to earn one’s living, not having access to credit. It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities. It means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living in marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unyin/documents/ydiDavidGordon_poverty.pdf|title=Indicators of Poverty & Hunger|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2011-05-27[/tpl]
World Bank: Poverty is pronounced deprivation in well-being, and comprises many dimensions. It includes low incomes and the inability to acquire the basic goods and services necessary for survival with dignity. Poverty also encompasses low levels of health and education, poor access to clean water and sanitation, inadequate physical security, lack of voice, and insufficient capacity and opportunity to better one’s life.

Poverty is usually measured as either absolute or relative (the latter being actually an index of income inequality).

===Absolute poverty===

Absolute poverty refers to a set standard which is consistent over time and between countries. First introduced in 1990, the dollar a day poverty line measured absolute poverty by the standards of the world’s poorest countries. The World Bank defined the new international poverty line as $1.25 a day for 2005 (equivalent to $1.00 a day in 1996 US prices).[tpl]cite report|first1=Martin|last1=Ravallion|first2=Shaohua|last2=Chen|first3=Prem|last3=Sangraula|date=May 2008|title=Dollar a Day Revisited|publisher=The World Bank|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/09/02/000158349_20080902095754/Rendered/PDF/wps4620.pdf|format=PDF|location=Washington DC|accessdate=10 June 2013[/tpl] but have recently been updated to be $1.25 and $2.50 per day.[tpl]cite journal|first1=Martin|last1=Ravallion|first2=Shaohua|last2=Chen|first3=Prem|last3=Sangraula|journal=The World Bank Economic Review|volume=23|pages=163–184|doi=10.1093/wber/lhp007|title=Dollar a day|accessdate=11 June 2013|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4499/wber_23_2_163.pdf?sequence=1|format=PDF|issue=2[/tpl] Absolute poverty, extreme poverty, or abject poverty is "a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information. It depends not only on income but also on access to services." UN declaration at World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen in 1995 The term 'absolute poverty', when used in this fashion, is usually synonymous with 'extreme poverty': Robert McNamara, the former President of the World Bank, described absolute or extreme poverty as, "...a condition so limited by malnutrition, illiteracy, disease, squalid surroundings, high infant mortality, and low life expectancy as to be beneath any reasonable definition of human decency".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.worldbank.org/poverty/mission/up2.htm |title=Poverty |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=23 April 2010[/tpl]In his book entitled The End of Poverty Jeffrey Sachs argued that extreme global poverty could be eliminated by 2025 if the wealthy countries of the world were to increase their combined foreign aid budgets to between $135 billion and $195 billion from 2005 to 2015. In 2004, 1.1 billion people lived in extreme poverty on less than a dollar a day.[tpl]cite book|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey D.|title=The End of Poverty|publisher=Penguin Press|date=30 December 2005|page=416|isbn=1-59420-045-9[/tpl] p. 20 Australia is one of the world's wealthier nations. In his article published in Australian Policy Online, Robert Tanton notes that, "While this amount is appropriate for third world countries, in Australia, the amount required to meet these basic needs will naturally be much higher because prices of these basic necessities are higher."
However as the amount of wealth required for survival is not the same in all places and time periods, particularly in highly developed countries where few people would fall below the World Bank's poverty lines, countries often develop their own National poverty lines.
An absolute poverty line was calculated in Australia for the Henderson poverty inquiry in 1973. It was $62.70 a week, which was the disposable income required to support the basic needs of a family of two adults and two dependent children at the time. This poverty line has been updated regularly by the Melbourne Institute according to increases in average incomes; for a single employed person it was $391.85 per week (including housing costs) in March 2009.[tpl]cite web|last=Tanton|first=Robert|title=Poverty versus inequality|publisher=Australian Policy Online|date=6 July 2009|url=http://apo.org.au/commentary/poverty-versus-inequality[/tpl] In Australia the OECD poverty would equate to a "disposable income of less than $358 per week for a single adult (higher for larger households to take account of their greater costs).[tpl]cite report|first=Peter|last=Davidson|title=Poverty in Australia|year=2012|publisher=Australian Council of Social Service|url=http://www.acoss.org.au/uploads/ACOSS%20Poverty%20Report%202012_Final.pdf|format=PDF|ISSN=1326 7124|ISBN=978085871082|accessdate=10 June 2013|location=Strawberry Hills, NSW[/tpl]
For a few years starting 1990, The World Bank anchored absolute poverty line as $1 per day. This was revised in 1993, and through 2005, absolute poverty was $1.08 a day for all countries on a purchasing power parity basis, after adjusting for inflation to the 1993 U.S. dollar. In 2005, after extensive studies of cost of living across the world, The World Bank raised the measure for global poverty line to reflect the observed higher cost of living.[tpl]cite web|title=Dollar a Day Revisited|publisher=The World Bank|year=2008|author=Martin Ravallion, Shaohua Chen and Prem Sangraula|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2008/09/02/000158349_20080902095754/Rendered/PDF/wps4620.pdf[/tpl] Now, the World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than US$1.25 (PPP) per day, and moderate poverty[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] as less than $2 or $5 a day (but note that a person or family with access to subsistence resources, e.g. subsistence farmers, may have a low cash income without a correspondingly low standard of living – they are not living "on" their cash income but using it as a top up). It estimates that "in 2001, 1.1 billion people had consumption levels below $1 a day and 2.7 billion lived on less than $2 a day."[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/0,,contentMDK:20153855~menuPK:373757~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:336992,00.html |title=The World Bank, 2007, Understanding Poverty |publisher=Web.worldbank.org |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2010-10-24[/tpl] A dollar a day, in nations that do not use the U.S. dollar as currency, does not translate to living a day on the equivalent amount of local currency as determined by the exchange rate.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7122356.stm|title=When a dollar a day means 25 cents|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=2011-05-28|first=Mukul|last=Devichand|date=2007-12-02[/tpl] Rather, it is determined by the purchasing power parity rate, which would look at how much local currency is needed to buy the same things that a dollar could buy in the United States. Usually, this would translate to less local currency than the exchange rate in poorer countries as the United States is a relatively more expensive country.
The poverty line threshold of $1.25 per day, as set by The World Bank, is controversial. Each nation has its own threshold for absolute poverty line; in the United States, for example, the absolute poverty line was US$15.15 per day in 2010 (US$22,000 per year for a family of four),[tpl]cite web|title=Poverty Definitions|publisher=US Census Bureau|year=2011|url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/methods/definitions.html[/tpl] while in India it was US$ 1.0 per day and in China the absolute poverty line was US$ 0.55 per day, each on PPP basis in 2010.[tpl]cite web|title=New Progress in Development-oriented Poverty Reduction Program for Rural China (1,274 yuan per year = US$ 0.55 per day)|publisher=The Government of China|year=2011|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/official/2011-11/16/content_1994729_3.htm[/tpl] These different poverty lines make data comparison between each nation's official reports qualitatively difficult. Some scholars argue that The World Bank method sets the bar too high, others argue it is low. Still others suggest that poverty line misleads as it measures everyone below the poverty line the same, when in reality someone living on $1.2 per day is in a different state of poverty than someone living on $0.2 per day. In other words, the depth and intensity of poverty varies across the world and in any regional populations, and $1.25 per day poverty line and head counts are inadequate measures.[tpl]cite web|title=World Bank's $1.25/day poverty measure- countering the latest criticisms|publisher=The World Bank|year=2010|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:22510787~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:469382,00.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Poverty Measures|publisher=The World Bank|year=2009|url=http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/93518/Hung_0603/Hu_0603/Module4MeasuringPovertyMeasures.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Poverty: An Ordinal Approach to Measurement|author=Amartya Sen|journal=Econometrica|volume= 44|date= March 1976|pages= 219–231|jstor=1912718|issue= 2|doi=10.2307/1912718[/tpl]

===Relative poverty===

Relative poverty views poverty as socially defined and dependent on social context, hence relative poverty is a measure of income inequality. Usually, relative poverty is measured as the percentage of population with income less than some fixed proportion of median income. There are several other different income inequality metrics, for example the Gini coefficient or the Theil Index.
Relative poverty is the "most useful measure for ascertaining poverty rates in wealthy developed nations."[tpl]cite journal|journal=Canadian Journal of Nursing Research (CJNR)|volume=41|date=June 2009.

"Once economic development has progressed beyond a certain minimum level, the rub of the poverty problem – from the point of view of both the poor individual and of the societies in which they live – is not so much the effects of poverty in any absolute form but the effects of the contrast, daily perceived, between the lives of the poor and the lives of those around them.

In 1979, British sociologist, Peter Townsend published his famous definition, "individuals ... can be said to be in poverty when they lack the resources to obtain the types of diet, participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are customary, or are at least widely encouraged or approved, in the societies to which they belong (page 31)."[tpl]cite book|author=Townsend, P.|year=1979|title=Poverty in the United Kingdom|location=London|publisher=Penguin[/tpl]
Brian Nolan and Christopher T. Whelan of the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Ireland explained that, "Poverty has to be seen in terms of the standard of living of the society in question."[tpl]cite journal|author1=Callan, T.|author2=Nolan, Brian|author3=Whelan, Christopher T. |year=1993|journal=Journal of Social Policy|volume=22|pages=141–172|doi=10.1017/S0047279400019280|title=Resources, Deprivation and the Measurement of Poverty|issue=2[/tpl]
Relative poverty measures are used as official poverty rates by the European Union, UNICEF and the OEDC. The main poverty line used in the OECD and the European Union is based on "economic distance", a level of income set at 60% of the median household income.

===Other aspects===

Economic aspects of poverty focus on material needs, typically including the necessities of daily living, such as food, clothing, shelter, or safe drinking water. Poverty in this sense may be understood as a condition in which a person or community is lacking in the basic needs for a minimum standard of well-being and life, particularly as a result of a persistent lack of income.
Analysis of social aspects of poverty links conditions of scarcity to aspects of the distribution of resources and power in a society and recognizes that poverty may be a function of the diminished "capability" of people to live the kinds of lives they value. The social aspects of poverty may include lack of access to information, education, health care, or political power.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.paho.org/english/sha/be_v23n1-glossary.htm |title=A Glossary for Social Epidemiology |publisher=World Health Organization |date=March 2002 |accessdate=2011-06-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.journalofpoverty.org/JOPPURP/JOPPURP.HTM |title=Journal of Poverty |publisher=Journal of Poverty |accessdate=2010-10-24[/tpl]
Poverty levels are snapshot picture in time that omits the transitional dynamics between levels. Mobility statistics supply additional information about the fraction who leave the poverty level. For example, one study finds that in a sixteen-year period (1975 to 1991 in the U.S.) only 5% of those in the lower fifth of the income level were still in that level, while 95% transitioned to a higher income category.[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/fed/annual/1999/ar95.pdf|page=6|title=By Our Own Bootstraps|author=W. Michael Cox |author2=Richard Alm|year=1995|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas[/tpl] Poverty levels can remain the same while those who rise out of poverty are replaced by others. The transient poor and chronic poor differ in each society. In a nine-year period ending in 2005 for the U.S., 50% of the poorest quintile transitioned to a higher quintile.[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/incomemobilitystudy03-08revise.pdf| title=Income Mobility in the U.S. from 1996 to 2005| publisher=Department of the Treasury| date=Nov 13, 2007[/tpl]
Poverty may also be understood as an aspect of unequal social status and inequitable social relationships, experienced as social exclusion, dependency, and diminished capacity to participate, or to develop meaningful connections with other people in society.H Silver, 1994, social exclusion and social solidarity, in International Labour Review, 133 5–6G Simmel, The poor, Social Problems 1965 13P Townsend, 1979, Poverty in the UK, Penguin Such social exclusion can be minimized through strengthened connections with the mainstream, such as through the provision of relational care to those who are experiencing poverty.
The World Bank's "Voices of the Poor," based on research with over 20,000 poor people in 23 countries, identifies a range of factors which poor people identify as part of poverty. These include:
David Moore, in his book The World Bank, argues that some analysis of poverty reflect pejorative, sometimes racial, stereotypes of impoverished people as powerless victims and passive recipients of aid programs.Chapter on Voices of the Poor in David Moore's edited book The World Bank: Development, Poverty, Hegemony (University of KwaZulu-Natal Press, 2007)
Ultra-poverty, a term apparently coined by Michael Lipton,Lipton, Michael (1986), 'Seasonality and ultra-poverty', Sussex, IDS Bulletin 17.3 connotes being amongst poorest of the poor in low-income countries. Lipton defined ultra-poverty as receiving less than 80 percent of minimum caloric intake whilst spending more than 80% of income on food. Alternatively a 2007 report issued by International Food Policy Research Institute defined ultra-poverty as living on less than 54 cents per day.International Food Policy Research Institute, The World's Most Deprived.

A pair of studies of the influence of poverty on the ability to reason about complicated issues requiring an immediate solution found that poverty directly impedes cognitive function.

===Hunger===

Rises in the costs of living making poor people less able to afford items. Poor people spend a greater portion of their budgets on food than richer people.

===Education===

Research has found that there is a high risk of educational underachievement for children who are from low-income housing circumstances. This is often a process that begins in primary school for some less fortunate children. Instruction in the US educational system, as well as in most other countries, tends to be geared towards those students who come from more advantaged backgrounds. As a result, children in poverty are at a higher risk than advantaged children for retention in their grade, special deleterious placements during the school's hours and even not completing their high school education.Huston, A. C. (1991). Children in Poverty: Child Development and Public Policy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. There are indeed many explanations for why students tend to drop out of school. One is the conditions of which they attend school. Schools in poverty-stricken areas have conditions that hinder children from learning in a safe environment. Researchers have developed a name for areas like this: an urban war zone is a poor, crime-laden district in which deteriorated, violent, even war-like conditions and underfunded, largely ineffective schools promote inferior academic performance, including irregular attendance and disruptive or non-compliant classroom behavior.Garbarino, J., Dubrow, N., Kostelny, K., & Pardo, C. ~1992!. Children in Danger: Coping with the Consequences. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. Print. For children with low resources, the risk factors are similar to others such as juvenile delinquency rates, higher levels of teenage pregnancy, and the economic dependency upon their low income parent or parents.
Families and society who submit low levels of investment in the education and development of less fortunate children end up with less favorable results for the children who see a life of parental employment reduction and low wages. Higher rates of early childbearing with all the connected risks to family, health and well-being are major important issues to address since education from preschool to high school are both identifiably meaningful in a life.
Poverty often drastically affects children's success in school. A child's "home activities, preferences, mannerisms" must align with the world and in the cases that they do not these students are at a disadvantage in the school and most importantly the classroom.Solley, Bobbie A. (2005). When Poverty's Children Write: Celebrating Strengths, Transforming Lives. Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann, Inc. Therefore, it is safe to state that children who live at or below the poverty level will have far less success educationally than children who live above the poverty line. Poor children have a great deal less healthcare and this ultimately results in many absences from the academic year. Additionally, poor children are much more likely to suffer from hunger, fatigue, irritability, headaches, ear infections, flu, and colds. These illnesses could potentially restrict a child or student's focus and concentration.

It is speculated that, flush with money, orphanages are increasing and push for children to join even though demographic data show that even the poorest extended families usually take in children whose parents have died.

===Utilities===

Water utility subsidies tend to subsidize water consumption by those connected to the network, which typically includes the richer segment of the population. As a result, the price of water decreases to the extent that only 30%, on average, of the supplying costs in developing countries is covered.
This results in a lack of incentive to maintain delivery systems, leading to losses from leaks annually that is enough for 200 million people.
This also leads to a lack of incentive to invest in expanding the network, resulting in much of the poor population being unconnected to the network. Instead, the poor buy water from water vendors for, on average, about five to 16 times the metered price. However, subsidies for laying new connections to the network rather than for consumption has shown more promise for the poor.
Similarly, the poorest fifth receive 0.1% of the world’s lighting but pay a fifth of total spending on light, accounting for 25 to 30 percent of their income.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Making-a-difference/Change-Agent/2012/0216/Solar-power-cheap-electricity-for-world-s-poor|title=Solar power: Cheap electricity for the world's poor |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=2012-02-16|accessdate=2012-07-26|first=Carl|last=Pope[/tpl] Indoor air pollution from burning fuels kills 2 million, with almost half the deaths from pneumonia in children under 5.[tpl]cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/in-africas-vanishing-forests-the-benefits-of-bamboo/?ref=global-home|title=In Africa's vanishing forests, the benefits of bamboo|work=New York Times|date=2012-03-13|accessdate=2012-07-26|first=Tina|last=Rosenberg[/tpl] Fuel from Bamboo burns more cleanly and also matures much faster than wood, thus also reducing deforestation.

==Poverty reduction==

Various poverty reduction strategies are broadly categorized here based on whether they make more of the basic human needs available or increase the disposable income needed to purchase those needs. Some strategies such as building roads can both bring access to various basic needs, such as fertilizer or healthcare from urban areas, as well as increase incomes, by bringing better access to urban markets.

===Increasing the supply of basic needs===

====Food and other goods====

ISBN 0-631-22028-3 The initial industrial revolution led to high economic growth and eliminated mass absolute poverty in what is now considered the developed world.

Even with new products, such as better seeds, or greater volumes of them, such as industrial production, the poor still require access to these products. Improving road and transportation infrastructure helps solve this major bottleneck.  In Africa, it costs more to move fertilizer from an African seaport 60 miles inland than to ship it from the United States to Africa because of sparse, low quality roads, leading to fertilizer costs two to six times the world average.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/world/africa/31soil.html?_r=0|title=Overfarming African land is worsening Hunger Crisis|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=February 9, 2013|first=Celia|last=Dugger|date=March 31, 2006[/tpl] Microfranchising models such as door to door businesses are used to sell basic needs to remote areas for below market prices.[tpl]cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/the-avon-ladies-of-africa/|title=The 'Avon Ladies' of Africa|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=February 9, 2013|first=Tina|last=Rosenberg|date=October 10, 2012[/tpl]

Illicit capital flight from the developing world is estimated at ten times the size of aid it receives and twice the debt service it pays.

The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as primary holders of developing countries' debt, attach structural adjustment conditionalities in return for loans which generally include the elimination of state subsidies and the privatization of state services.

Raising farm incomes is described as the core of the antipoverty effort as three quarters of the poor today are farmers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/world/africa/20worldbank.html|title=World Bank report puts agriculture at core of antipoverty effort|work=The New York Times |accessdate=2011-05-27|first=Celia W.|last=Dugger|date=2007-10-20[/tpl] Estimates show that growth in the agricultural productivity of small farmers is, on average, at least twice as effective in benefiting the poorest half of a country’s population as growth generated in nonagricultural sectors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/0,,contentMDK:21893554~menuPK:2643747~pagePK:64020865~piPK:149114~theSitePK:336992,00.html|title=Climate Change: Bangladesh facing the challenge|publisher=The World Bank|date=2008-09-08|accessdate=2011-07-05[/tpl]

====Income grants====

A guaranteed minimum income ensures that every citizen will live be able to purchase a desired level of basic needs. A basic income (or negative income tax) is a system of social security, that periodically provides each citizen, rich or poor, with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on. Studies of large cash-transfer programs in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi show that the programs can be effective in increasing consumption, schooling, and nutrition, whether they are tied to such conditions or not.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,642310,00.html|title=A new approach to aid: How a basic income program saved a Namibian village|work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=2011-05-28[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7415814.stm|title=Namibians line up for free cash|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=2011-05-28|date=2008-05-23[/tpl] Proponents argue that a basic income is more economically efficient than a minimum wage and unemployment benefits, as the minimum wage effectively imposes a high marginal tax on employers, causing losses in efficiency. In 1968, Paul Samuelson, John Kenneth Galbraith and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce a system of income guarantees.Economists' Statement on Guaranteed Annual Income, 1/15/1968-4/18/1969 folder, General Correspondence Series, Papers of John Kenneth Galbraith, John F.

Income grants are argued to be vastly more efficient in extending basic needs to the poor than subsidies. This is largely because the beneficiaries of such subsidies are the general population, including the non-poor. Its effectiveness in poverty alleviation is diluted by the non-poor who enjoy the same subsidized prices. In some countries, fuel subsidies are a larger part of the budget than health and education.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/12/20121210104516139607.htm |title= How to end fossil fuel subsidies without hurting the poor|publisher=Aljazeera|accessdate=23 January 2013|date=11 December 2012[/tpl] A 2008 study concluded that the money spent on in-kind transfers in India in a year could lift all India’s poor out of poverty for that year if transferred directly.

====Financial services====

Microloans, made famous by the Grameen Bank, is where small amounts of money are loaned to farmers or villages, mostly women, who can then obtain physical capital to increase their economic rewards.

However, researchers[tpl]Who|date=November 2009[/tpl] have gathered evidence that suggest that values are not as deeply ingrained and that changing economic opportunities explain most of the movement into and out of poverty, as opposed to shifts in values.Kerbo, Harold. 2006.

==Climate change==

A report published in 2013 by the World Bank, with support from the Climate & Development Knowledge Network, found that climate change was likely to hinder future attempts to reduce poverty. The report presented the likely impacts of present day, 2 °C and 4 °C warming on agricultural production, water resources, coastal ecosystems and cities across Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and South East Asia. The impacts of a temperature rise of 2 °C included: regular food shortages in Sub-Saharan Africa; shifting rain patterns in South Asia leaving some parts under water and others without enough water for power generation, irrigation or drinking; degradation and loss of reefs in South East Asia, resulting in reduced fish stocks; and coastal communities and cities more vulnerable to increasingly violent storms.REPORT: Warmer world will keep millions of people trapped in poverty.

==Voluntary==

Among some individuals, poverty is considered a necessary or desirable condition, which must be embraced to reach certain spiritual, moral, or intellectual states. Poverty is often understood to be an essential element of renunciation in religions such as Buddhism (only for monks, not for lay persons) and Jainism, whilst in Roman Catholicism it is one of the evangelical counsels.  The main aim of giving up materialistic world is to withdraw oneself from sensual pleasures (as they are fake and temporary in some religions). This self-invited poverty (or giving up pleasures) is different from the one caused by economic imbalance.
Benedict XVI distinguishes “poverty chosen” (the poverty of spirit proposed by Jesus), and “poverty to be fought” (unjust and imposed poverty). He considers that the moderation implied in the former favors solidarity, and is a necessary condition so as to fight effectively to eradicate the abuse of the latter.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20090101_world-day-peace_en.html|title=World Peace Day Address 2009|publisher=The Vatican|date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2011-06-21[/tpl]
