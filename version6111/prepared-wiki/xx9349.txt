The Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist bomb attack on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. The bombing killed 168 people and injured more than 680 others.[tpl]cite web|last=Shariat|first=Sheryll|coauthors=Sue Mallonee and Shelli Stephens-Stidham|title=Summary of Reportable Injuries in Oklahoma|publisher=Oklahoma State Department of Health|url=http://www.health.state.ok.us/PROGRAM/injury/Summary/bomb/OKCbomb.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080110063748/http://www.health.state.ok.us/PROGRAM/injury/Summary/bomb/OKCbomb.htm|archivedate=January 10, 2008|date=December 1998[/tpl] The blast destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a 16-block radius, destroyed or burned 86 cars, and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings,[tpl]cite web|title=Oklahoma City Police Department Alfred P.

Within 90 minutes of the explosion, Timothy McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma State Trooper Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for unlawfully carrying a weapon.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36557212|title=Timothy McVeigh is apprehended|work=NBC News Report|date=April 22, 1995|format=Video, 3 minutes|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wovbHymi|archivedate=February 27, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Ottley|first=Ted|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/mcveigh/snag_2.html|title=License Tag Snag|publisher=truTV|date=April 14, 2005|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5woveWodn|archivedate=February 27, 2011[/tpl] Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Terry Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, an American militia movement sympathizer who was a Gulf War veteran, had detonated an explosive-filled Ryder rental truck parked in front of the building. McVeigh's co-conspirator, Terry Nichols, had assisted in the bomb preparation. Motivated by his hatred of the federal government and angered by what he perceived as its mishandling of the 1993 Waco siege and the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at Waco.[tpl]cite news|last=Feldman|first=Paul|title=Militia Groups Growing, Study Says Extremism: Despite negative publicity since Oklahoma bombing, membership has risen, Anti-Defamation League finds|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/21526848.html?dids=21526848:21526848&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+18%2C+1995&author=PAUL+FELDMAN&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=Militia+Groups+Growing%2C+Study+Says+Extremism%3A+Despite+negative+publicity+since+Oklahoma+bombing%2C+membership+has+risen%2C+Anti-Defamation+League+finds.&pqatl=google|format=Fee required|date=June 18, 1995|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 7, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=McVeigh offers little remorse in letters|url=http://www.cjonline.com/stories/061001/new_mcveigh.shtml|date=June 10, 2001|publisher=The Topeka Capital-Journal|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wovjJCKV|archivedate=February 27, 2011[/tpl]
The official investigation, known as "OKBOMB", saw FBI agents conduct 28,000 interviews, amass [tpl]convert|3.5|ST|MT|abbr=on[/tpl] of evidence, and collect nearly one billion pieces of information.[tpl]cite book|last=Serano|first=Richard|title=One of Ours: Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing|pages=139–141[/tpl][tpl]cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Lessons learned, and not learned, 11 years later|publisher=MSNBC|date=April 16, 2006|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12343917/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wovkrtuQ|archivedate=February 27, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Apocalypse in Oklahoma|last=Hamm|first=Mark S|page=vii|isbn=1-55553-300-0[/tpl] The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997. McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001, and Nichols was sentenced to life in prison. Michael and Lori Fortier testified against McVeigh and Nichols; Michael was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to warn the U.S. government, and Lori received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony.
As a result of the bombing, the U.S. government passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which tightened the standards for habeas corpus in the United States,[tpl]cite web|last=Doyle|first=Charles|title=Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996: A Summary|publisher=FAS|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/96-499.htm|date=June 3, 1996|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGXWAzia|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl] as well as legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks. On April 19, 2000, the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated on the site of the Murrah Federal Building, commemorating the victims of the bombing. Annual remembrance services are held at the same time of day as the explosion occurred.

==Planning==

===Motivation===

The chief conspirators, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, met in 1988 at Fort Benning during basic training for the U.S. Army. Michael Fortier, McVeigh's accomplice, was his Army roommate. The three shared interests in survivalism. They expressed anger at the federal government's handling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) standoff with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge as well as the Waco siege—a 1993 51-day standoff between the FBI and Branch Davidian members which began with a botched ATF attempt to execute a search warrant leading to a fire fight (it is unknown whether ATF agents or Branch Davidians fired the first shot) and ended with the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 75 others. In March 1993, McVeigh visited the Waco site during the standoff, and then again after its conclusion. McVeigh later decided to bomb a federal building as a response to the raids.

===Target selection===

McVeigh initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing.[tpl]cite book|last=Michel|first=Lou|coauthors=Dan Herbeck|title=American Terrorist|page=224|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl] McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law-enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law-enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.[tpl]cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|page=167|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl]
McVeigh, a resident of Kingman, Arizona, considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. McVeigh stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize nongovernmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because of the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor.[tpl]cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|pages=168–169|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl] In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The Murrah building had been previously targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell. The group had plotted to park "a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer."[tpl]cite news|last=Thomas|first=Jo|coauthor=Ronald Smothers|title=Oklahoma City Building Was Target Of Plot as Early as '83, Official Says|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/20/us/oklahoma-city-building-was-target-of-plot-as-early-as-83-official-says.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|work=The New York Times|date=May 20, 1995|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/606v3z6yB|archivedate=July 11, 2011[/tpl] After Snell's appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied, he was executed the same day as the Murrah bombing.[tpl]cite news|title=White Supremacist Executed For Murdering 2 in Arkansas|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/21/us/white-supremacist-executed-for-murdering-2-in-arkansas.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 21, 1995|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/606vGXinb|archivedate=July 11, 2011[/tpl]
The nine-story building, built in 1977, was named for a federal judge and housed fourteen federal agencies including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Carol W.|title=The Terror that Failed: Public Opinion in the Aftermath of the Bombing in Oklahoma City|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=60|issue=3|date=May–June 2000|pages=201–210|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-63060012/terror-failed-public-opinion.html|format=Registration required|doi=10.1111/0033-3352.00080[/tpl] The Murrah building was chosen for its glass front—which was expected to shatter under the impact of the blast—and its adjacent large, open parking lot across the street, which might absorb and dissipate some of the force, and protect the occupants of nearby non-federal buildings. In addition, McVeigh believed that the open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes. The attack was planned to take place on April 19, 1995, to coincide with the anniversary of the Waco Siege and the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord.[tpl]cite book|last=Michel|first=Lou|coauthors=Dan Herbeck|title=American Terrorist|page=226|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl]

They allegedly robbed gun collector Roger E. Moore in his home of $60,000 worth of guns, gold, silver, and jewels, transporting the property in the victim's own van. McVeigh had previously visited Moore's ranch, but doubts have been raised about Nichols and McVeigh's involvement in the robbery for several reasons. The robbers wore ski masks (making a positive identification impossible), and the physical description given did not match Nichols.[tpl]cite news|last=McCoy|first=Max|url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/140/timothy_mcveigh_and_the_neonazi_bankrobbers.html |title=Timothy McVeigh and the neo-Nazi Bankrobbers|work=Fortean Times|date=November 2004|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5woxP0H7c|archivedate=February 27, 2011[/tpl] Also, Aryan Republican Army robbers were operating in the area of Moore's ranch at the time.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-02-25-mcveigh-fbi_x.htm|title=AP: FBI suspected McVeigh link to supremacist robbers|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|date=February 25, 2004|accessdate=March 24, 2009[/tpl] McVeigh did not need to raise money for the bomb, which only cost about $5,000.

In October 1994, McVeigh showed Michael Fortier and his wife, Lori, a diagram he had drawn of the bomb he wanted to build. McVeigh planned to construct a bomb containing more than [tpl]convert|5000|lb|kg[/tpl] of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, mixed with about [tpl]convert|1200|lb|kg[/tpl] of liquid nitromethane and [tpl]convert|350|lb|kg[/tpl] of Tovex. Including the weight of the sixteen 55-U.S.-gallon drums in which the explosive mixture was to be packed, the bomb would have a combined weight of about [tpl]convert|7000|lb|kg[/tpl].[tpl]cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|pages=163–164|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl] McVeigh had originally intended to use hydrazine rocket fuel, but it proved to be too expensive. In October 1994, posing as a motorcycle racer, McVeigh obtained three [tpl]convert|55|U.S.gal|impgal L|adj=on[/tpl] drums of nitromethane on the pretense that he and some fellow bikers needed the fuel for racing.[tpl]cite news|last=Florio|first=Gwen|title=McVeigh's Sister Takes the Stand Against Him He Spoke of Moving From Antigovernment Talk to Action, She Testified, and of Transporting Explosives|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=May 6, 1997[/tpl]
McVeigh rented a storage space, in which he stockpiled seven crates of 18-inch-long Tovex sausages, 80 spools of shock tube, and 500 electric blasting caps, which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in Marion, Kansas. He decided not to steal any of the [tpl]convert|40000|lb|kg[/tpl] of ANFO (ammonium nitrate fuel oil) he found at the scene, as he did not believe it to be powerful enough (although he did obtain seventeen bags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb). McVeigh made a prototype bomb using a plastic Gatorade jug containing ammonium nitrate prills, liquid nitromethane, a piece of Tovex sausage, and a blasting cap.[tpl]cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|page=165|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl] The prototype was detonated in the desert to avoid detection.

Later, speaking about the military mindset with which he went about the preparations, he said, "You learn how to handle killing in the military. I face the consequences, but you learn to accept it." He compared his actions to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, rather than the attack on Pearl Harbor, reasoning it was necessary to prevent more lives from being lost.
On April 14, 1995, McVeigh paid for a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in Junction City, Kansas.[tpl]cite book|last=Michel|first=Lou|coauthors=Dan Herbeck|title=American Terrorist|page=209|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl] The following day he rented a 1993 Ford F-700 truck from Ryder under the name Robert D.

===Building the bomb===

On April 17–18, 1995, McVeigh and Nichols removed their supplies from their storage unit in Herington, Kansas, where Nichols lived. They loaded their bomb supplies into a Ryder rental truck.[tpl]cite book|last=Michel|first=Lou |coauthors=Dan Herbeck|title=American Terrorist|page=215|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl] The two then drove to Geary Lake State Park, where they nailed boards onto the floor of the truck to hold the 13 barrels in place and mixed the chemicals using plastic buckets and a bathroom scale.[tpl]cite book|last=Michel|first=Lou|coauthors=Dan Herbeck|title=American Terrorist|page=216|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl] Each filled barrel weighed nearly [tpl]convert|500|lb|kg[/tpl].[tpl]cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|pages=217–218|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl] McVeigh added more explosives to the driver's side of the cargo bay, which he could ignite (killing himself in the process) at close range with his Glock 21 pistol in case the primary fuses failed.[tpl]cite book|last=Michel|first=Lou|coauthors=Dan Herbeck|title=American Terrorist|page=219|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl] During McVeigh's trial, Lori Fortier (the wife of Michael Fortier) stated that McVeigh claimed to have arranged the barrels in order to form a shaped charge. This was achieved by tamping the aluminum side panel of the truck with bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to direct the blast laterally towards the building.[tpl]cite web|title=Some Practical Applications of Forensic Seismology|last=Rogers|first=J. David|coauthors=Keith D. Koper|publisher=Missouri University of Science and Technology|url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/Forensic%20Seismology-revised.pdf|format=PDF|pages=25–35|accessdate=June 5, 2009[/tpl] Specifically, McVeigh arranged the barrels in the shape of a backwards J; he later said that for pure destructive power, he would have put the barrels on the side of the cargo bay closest to the Murrah Building; however, such an unevenly distributed [tpl]convert|7000|lb|kg|adj=on[/tpl] load might have broken an axle, flipped the truck over, or at least caused it to lean to one side, which could have drawn attention.
McVeigh then added a dual-fuse ignition system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled two holes in the cab of the truck under the seat, while two holes were also drilled in the body of the truck. One green cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab of the truck, through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit, to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around 350 pounds of high grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck's livery, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make them harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the [tpl]convert|350|lb|kg[/tpl] of Tovex Blastrite Gel "sausages", which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13 filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about [tpl]convert|4|U.S.gal|impgal L|adj=on[/tpl] of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast. After finishing the truck bomb, the two men separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh with the truck to Junction City.

==Bombing==

McVeigh's original plan had been to detonate the bomb at 11:00 am, but at dawn on April 19, 1995, he decided instead to destroy the building at 9:00 am.[tpl]cite book|last=Michel|first=Lou|coauthors=Dan Herbeck|title=American Terrorist|page=220|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl] As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck, McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from The Turner Diaries—a fictional account of white supremacists who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9:15 one morning using a truck bomb. McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with the motto of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Sic semper tyrannis ("Thus always to tyrants", according to legend what Brutus said as he assassinated Julius Caesar, also shouted by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln) and "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants" (from Thomas Jefferson). He also carried an envelope of anti-government materials that included a bumper sticker with Thomas Jefferson slogan, "When the government fears the people, there is liberty.

==Arrests==

Initially, the FBI had three hypotheses regarding who might have been responsible for the bombing. The first was international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a drug cartel might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by Christian fascists acting on conspiracy theories.[tpl]cite book|title=Apocalypse in Oklahoma|last=Hamm|first=Mark S|pages=62–63|isbn=1-55553-300-0[/tpl]

While investigating the VIN from an axle of the truck used in the explosion and the remnants of the license plate, federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City. Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing.[tpl]cite book|title=Apocalypse in Oklahoma|last=Hamm|first=Mark S|page=65|isbn=1-55553-300-0[/tpl] McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. However, McGown noted, "People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name, they almost always go to write, and then look up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use. That's what McVeigh did, and when he looked up I started talking to him, and it threw him."
After an April 21, 1995, court hearing on the gun charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents took him into custody as they continued their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off by the arrival of police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail.

Within 23 minutes of the bombing, the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) was set up, consisting of representatives from the state departments of public safety, human services, military, health, and education.

The EMS command post was set up almost immediate following the attack and oversaw triage, treatment, transportation, and decontamination. A simple plan/objective was established: treatment and transportation of the injured was to be done as quickly as possible, supplies and personnel to handle a large amount of patients was needed immediately, the dead needed to be moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred to the coroner's office, and measures for a long-term medical operation needed to be established.[tpl]cite journal|last=Davis|first=G|title=Victims by the Hundreds: EMS Response and Command|journal=Fire Engineering|year=1995|volume=148|issue=10|pages=98–107|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu/ehost/detail?vid=4&hid=120&sid=addefe36-e54d-4fd6-b9b5-8e7d53deac96%40sessionmgr110&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&AN=9511202906|accessdate=November 17, 2012[/tpl] The triage center was set up near the Murrah Building and all the wounded were directed there.

One nurse was killed in the rescue attempt after she was hit on the head by debris, and 26 other rescuers were hospitalized because of various injuries.[tpl]cite book|last=Figley|first=Charles R|title=Treating Compassion Fatigue|page=62|isbn=1-58391-053-0[/tpl] Twenty-four K-9 units and out-of-state dogs were brought in to search for survivors and bodies in the building debris.[tpl]cite book|last=Irving|first=Clive|title=In Their Name|page=103|isbn=0-679-44825-X[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Giordano|first=Geraldine|title=The Oklahoma City Bombing|page=34|isbn=0-8239-3655-4[/tpl] In an effort to recover additional bodies, [tpl]convert|100|to|350|ST|MT|abbr=on[/tpl] of rubble were removed from the site each day from April 24 to April 29, 1995.[tpl]cite book|last=Irving|first=Clive|title=In Their Name|page=86|isbn=0-679-44825-X[/tpl]

===Humanitarian aid===

The national humanitarian response was immediate, and in some cases even overwhelming. Large numbers of items such as wheelbarrows, bottled water, helmet lights, knee pads, rain gear, and even football helmets were donated. The sheer quantity of such donations caused logistical and inventory control problems until drop-off centers were set up to accept and sort the goods. The Oklahoma Restaurant Association, which was holding a trade show in the city, assisted rescue workers by providing 15,000 to 20,000 meals over a ten-day period.[tpl]cite book|last=Linenthal|first=Edward|title=The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory|page=47|isbn=0-19-516107-6[/tpl]

===Federal and state government aid===

At 9:45 am, Governor Frank Keating declared a state of emergency and ordered all non-essential workers in the Oklahoma City area to be released from their duties for their safety. President Bill Clinton learned about the bombing at around 9:30 am while he was meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Çiller at the White House.[tpl]cite book|title=Apocalypse in Oklahoma|last=Hamm|first=Mark S|page=46|isbn=1-55553-300-0[/tpl] Prior to addressing the nation, President Clinton wanted to ground all planes in the Oklahoma City area to prevent the bombers from escaping by air, but decided against it. At 4:00 pm, President Clinton declared a federal emergency in Oklahoma City and spoke to the nation: [tpl]quote|The bombing in Oklahoma City was an attack on innocent children and defenseless citizens. It was an act of cowardice and it was evil. The United States will not tolerate it, and I will not allow the people of this country to be intimidated by evil cowards.[/tpl]

No major federal financial assistance was made available to the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing, but the Murrah Fund set up in the wake of the bombing attracted over $300,000 in federal grants. Over $40 million was donated to the city to aid disaster relief and to compensate the victims. Funds were initially distributed to families who needed it to get back on their feet, and the rest was held in trust for longer-term medical and psychological needs. By 2005, $18 million of the donations remained, some of which was earmarked to provide a college education for each of the 219 children who lost one or both parents in the bombing.[tpl]cite news|last=Witt|first=Howard|title=Torment lingers in OK City|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0504170293apr17,0,6613315.story|date=April 17, 2005|work=Chicago Tribune|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5woyfQS4l|archivedate=February 27, 2011[/tpl]  A committee chaired by Daniel Kurtenbach of Goodwill Industries provided financial assistance to the survivors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gimv.org/about_us/ceo.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070426071526/http://www.gimv.org/about_us/ceo.htm|archivedate=April 26, 2007|title=Meet Our President/CEO|publisher=Goodwill Industries[/tpl]

===International reaction===

International reactions to the bombing varied. President Clinton received many messages of sympathy, including those from Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Narasimha Rao of India.[tpl]cite news|title=Friend, Foe United in Vilifying Attack Reaction: Compassion for victims' families, disgust at blast's callousness run as common threads through world leaders' responses|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/21401509.html?dids=21401509:21401509&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+21%2C+1995&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=TERROR+IN+OKLAHOMA+CITY+Friend%2C+Foe+United+in+Vilifying+Attack+Reaction%3A+Compassion+for+victims%27+families%2C+disgust+at+blast%27s+callousness+run+as+common+threads+through+world+leaders%27+responses.&pqatl=google|format=Fee required|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 21, 1995|accessdate=April 7, 2010[/tpl] Iran condemned the bombing as an attack on innocent people, but also blamed U.S. policy for inciting it. Kuwaiti parliament member Ahmed Baqer stated "This is a criminal act. No religion and no law permit such acts. A lot of civilians and children were killed. This is against human rights. This is against logic. We as a movement reject this kind of action." Other condolences came from Russia, Canada, Australia, the United Nations, and the European Union, among other nations and organizations.[tpl]cite news|title='How Deeply We Share the Sorrow' Rabin Also Offers Help; Boutros-Ghali Condemns 'Cowardly Attack'|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=April 20, 1995[/tpl]
Several countries offered to assist in the rescue efforts and investigation. France offered a special rescue unit, and Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin offered to send agents with anti-terrorist expertise to help in the investigation. President Clinton declined Israel's offer, believing that to accept it would increase anti-Muslim sentiments and endanger Muslim-Americans.[tpl]cite book|title=Apocalypse in Oklahoma|last=Hamm|first=Mark S|pages=57–58|isbn=1-55553-300-0[/tpl]

===Children affected===

In the wake of the bombing, the national media seized upon the fact that 19 of the victims had been babies and children, many in the day-care center. At the time of the bombing, there were 100 day-care centers in the United States in 7,900 federal buildings. McVeigh later stated that he was unaware of the day-care center when choosing the building as a target, and if he had known "... it might have given me pause to switch targets. That's a large amount of collateral damage."[tpl]cite news|title=FBI: McVeigh knew children would be killed in OKC blast|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/03/29/mcveigh.book.01/|date=March 29, 2001|publisher=CNN|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5woyrpnH6|archivedate=February 27, 2011[/tpl] The FBI stated that McVeigh scouted the interior of the building in December 1994 and likely knew of the day-care center before the bombing. In April 2010, Joseph Hartzler, the prosecutor at McVeigh's trial, questioned how he could have decided to pass over a prior target building because of an included florist shop but at the Murrah building not "... notice that there's a child day-care center there, that there was a credit union there and a Social Security office?"[tpl]cite news|last=Schoenburg|first=Bernard|url=http://www.sj-r.com/top-stories/x57956772/McVeigh-prosecutor-Focus-on-victims-of-Oklahoma-City-bombing|title=McVeigh prosecutor: Focus on victims of Oklahoma City bombing|work=The State Journal-Register|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5woytrGdL|archivedate=February 27, 2011[/tpl]
Schools across the country were dismissed early and ordered closed. A photograph of firefighter Chris Fields emerging from the rubble with infant Baylee Almon, who later died in a nearby hospital, was reprinted worldwide and became a symbol of the attack.

These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of middle and high school students conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.[tpl]cite journal|last=Pfefferbaum|first=Betty|coauthors=Sconzo, Guy M.

Children were also affected through the loss of parents in the bombing. Many children lost one or more parents in the blast, with a reported seven children that lost their only remaining parent. Children of the disaster have been raised by single parents, foster parents, and other family members. Adjusting to the loss has made these children suffer psychologically and emotionally. One interview revealed the sleepless nights and obsession with death of one of the at least 10 orphaned children.[tpl]cite journal|last=Leland|first=John|title=The orphans of Oklahoma City|journal=Newsweek|date=22 April 1996|volume=127|issue=17|page=40|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu/ehost/detail?vid=6&hid=5&sid=707c93db-5d99-4077-abc0-8b54065a360e%40sessionmgr4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&AN=9604167868|accessdate=27 November 2012[/tpl]

===Media coverage===

Hundreds of news trucks and members of the press arrived at the site to cover the story. The press immediately noticed that the bombing took place on the second anniversary of the Waco incident. Many initial news stories hypothesized the attack had been undertaken by Islamic terrorists, such as those who had masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.[tpl]cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|page=249|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Guys and Guns Amok|last=Kellner|first=Douglas|page=102|isbn=1-59451-493-3[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Apocalypse in Oklahoma|last=Hamm|first=Mark S|page=55|isbn=1-55553-300-0[/tpl] Some responded to these reports by attacking Muslims and people of Arab descent.[tpl]cite journal|last=Progler|first=J.A|title=The Utility of Islamic Imagery in the West|journal=Al-Tawhid|volume=14|issue=4|url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/islamicimageryinwest.htm|accessdate=June 5, 2009[/tpl]

===Timothy McVeigh===

Opening arguments in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States was represented by a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137 witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it.[tpl]cite book|title=Patriots, Politics, and the Oklahoma City Bombing|last=Wright|first=Stuart|page=10|isbn=0-521-69419-1[/tpl] Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mcveigh/mcveighaccount.html|title=The Oklahoma City Bombing & The Trial of Timothy McVeigh|last=Linder|first=Douglas O.|year=2006|work=Famous Trials: Oklahoma City Bombing Trial|publisher=University of Missouri–Kansas City|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wozOiWjC|archivedate=February 27, 2011[/tpl]
McVeigh was represented by a defense counsel team of six principal attorneys led by Stephen Jones.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/mcveigh/front.htm|title=Petition for Writ of Mandamus of Petitioner-Defendant, Timothy James McVeigh and Brief in Support|work=Case No. 96-CR-68-M|date=March 25, 1997|publisher=United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wozSLp4c|archivedate=February 27, 2011[/tpl] According to law professor Douglas O. Linder, McVeigh wanted Jones to present a "necessity defense"—which would argue that he was in "imminent danger" from the government (that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government, such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents). McVeigh argued that "imminent" does not mean "immediate": "If a comet is hurtling toward the earth, and it's out past the orbit of Pluto, it's not an immediate threat to Earth, but it is an imminent threat."[tpl]cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|pages=285–286|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl] Despite McVeigh's wishes, Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution's case in an attempt to instill reasonable doubt. Jones also believed that McVeigh was part of a larger conspiracy, and sought to present him as "the designated patsy", but McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense. After a hearing, Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible. In addition to arguing that the bombing could not have been carried out by two men alone, Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near the scene of the crime, and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks. Jones presented 25 witnesses over a one-week period, including Dr. Frederic Whitehurst. Although Whitehurst described the FBI's sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence, he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated.
A key point of contention in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined to be that of Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing.[tpl]cite news|last=Johnston|first=David|title=Leg in the Oklahoma City Rubble Was That of a Black Woman|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/31/us/leg-in-the-oklahoma-city-rubble-was-that-of-a-black-woman.html|date=August 31, 1995|work=The New York Times|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wozdqYws|archivedate=February 27, 2011[/tpl] Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.[tpl]cite book|title=Writing at the End of the World|author=Miller, Richard Earl|page=100[/tpl]
Numerous damaging leaks, which appeared to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession said to have been inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial. A gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.[tpl]cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|pages=315–317|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl]

===Michael Fortier===

Michael and Lori Fortier were considered accomplices for their foreknowledge of the planning of the bombing. In addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver's license which was later used to rent the Ryder truck. Michael agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a reduced sentence and immunity for his wife.[tpl]cite news|title=Transcripts|publisher=CNN|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0601/20/sitroom.01.html|date=January 20, 2006|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGWgPluS|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl] He was sentenced on May 27, 1998 to twelve years in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack.[tpl]cite news|title=12-Year Sentence Given Again to Witness in Oklahoma Bombing|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/09/us/12-year-sentence-given-again-to-witness-in-oklahoma-bombing.html|date=October 9, 1999|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGWhzciu|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl] On January 20, 2006, after serving ten and a half years of his sentence, including time already served, Fortier was released for good behavior into the Witness Protection Program and given a new identity.[tpl]cite news|first=Arnold|last=Hamilton|title=New life, identity await Fortier as he leaves prison|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/011906dntexfortier.1742cf8f.html|work=The Dallas Morning News|date=January 18, 2006|publisher=HighBeam Research|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGWseZUR|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl]

===Others===

No "John Doe #2" was ever identified, nothing conclusive was ever reported regarding the owner of the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: "Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?"[tpl]cite news|first=Thomas|last=Jo|title='No Sympathy' for Dead Children, McVeigh Says|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/29/us/no-sympathy-for-dead-children-mcveigh-says.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2001|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGWwL6JH|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl] On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written "For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else.

===Legislation===

In the wake of the bombing the U.S. government enacted several pieces of legislation, notably the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20, 1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings. In response to passing the legislation, Clinton stated that "when someone is a victim, he or she should be at the center of the criminal justice process, not on the outside looking in."[tpl]cite journal|last=Cassell|first=Paul|title=Barbarians at the Gates?

====Oklahoma School Curriculum====

In the decade following the bombing, there was criticism of Oklahoma public schools for not requiring the bombing to be covered in the curriculum of mandatory Oklahoma history classes. Oklahoma History is a one-semester course required by state law for graduation from high school; however, the bombing was only covered for one to two pages at most in textbooks. The state's PASS standards (Priority Academic Student Skills) did not require that a student learn about the bombing, and focused more on other subjects such as corruption and the Dust Bowl.[tpl]cite web|author=Alex Cameron |url=http://www.newson6.com/story/12224663/15-years-later-time-to-teach-students-the-murrah-bombing |title=15 Years Later: Time To Teach Students The Murrah Bombing? |publisher=NewsOn6 |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2012[/tpl] On April 6, 2010, "House Bill 2750" was signed by Governor Brad Henry, requiring the bombing to be entered into the school curriculum for Oklahoma, U.S. and world history classes.[tpl]cite news|author=Ed Vulliamy |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/11/oklahoma-bombing-15-years-on |title=Oklahoma: the day homegrown terror hit America |publisher=the Guardian |date=11 April 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2012 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Jennifer Pierce |url=http://www.news9.com/Global/story.asp?S=12264522 |title=Governor Henry Signs Bill Making Murrah Bombing Required Learning |publisher=News9 |date=6 April 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Ricky Maranon |url=http://www.oudaily.com/news/2010/apr/07/bill-adds-okc-bombing-education-curriculum/ |title=Bill adds OKC bombing to education curriculum |publisher=The Oklahoma Daily |date=7 April 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]
On the signing, Governor Henry said “Although the events of April 19, 1995 may be etched in our minds and in the minds of Oklahomans who remember that day, we have a generation of Oklahomans that has little to no memory of the events of that day,”... “We owe it to the victims, the survivors and all of the people touched by this tragic event to remember April 19, 1995 and understand what it meant and still means to this state and this nation.”

===Discussion of the nature of dissent===

Even many who agreed with some of McVeigh's politics viewed his act as counterproductive, with much of the criticism focused on the deaths of innocent children; critics expressed chagrin that McVeigh had not assassinated specific government leaders. McVeigh had indeed contemplated the assassinations of Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead.[tpl]cite news|title=McVeigh Considered Assassination of Reno, Other Officials|date=April 27, 2001|publisher=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,17501,00.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGY3FIxG|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl] Those who expressed sympathy for McVeigh typically described his deed as an act of war, as in the case of Gore Vidal's essay The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh.[tpl]cite news|last=Vidal|first=Gore|title=The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh|date=September 2001|work=Vanity Fair|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2001/09/mcveigh200109|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGY5KeHI|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Gibbons|first=Fiachra|title=Vidal Praises Oklahoma Bomber for Heroic Aims|date=August 17, 2001|publisher=guardian.co.uk|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/aug/17/edinburghbookfestival2001.mcveigh|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGY9Jsdm|archivedate=March 17, 2011|location=London[/tpl] Other journalists compared him to John Brown.[tpl]cite news|last=Finkelman|first=Paul|title=Analogies: Was Timothy McVeigh Our John Brown?|date=July 6, 2001|publisher=History News Network|url=http://hnn.us/articles/139.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGYDpCAr|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl]
McVeigh believed that the bomb attack had a positive impact on government policy. In evidence he cited the peaceful resolution of the Montana Freemen standoff in 1996, the government's $3.1 million settlement with Randy Weaver and his surviving children four months after the bombing, and April 2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting his decision to storm the Branch Davidian compound. McVeigh stated, "Once you bloody the bully's nose, and he knows he's going to be punched again, he's not coming back around."[tpl]cite book|title=American Terrorist|pages=378–383|author=Michel, Lou|coauthor=Dan Herbeck|isbn=0-06-039407-2[/tpl]

===Conspiracy theories===

==Evacuation issues==

Once the explosion took place at the Alfred P. Murrah building, chaotic response filled the surrounding streets. Those who were able to flee the Murrah building did so, while others, stuck in the rubble, awaited the assistance of rescue workers and volunteers. As reported on CNN,OK City other federal buildings in the downtown area were not fully evacuated, but those who were able to leave the city were encouraged to do so. This traffic, along with the people leaving places around the Murrah Building clogged streets, delaying the arrival of rescue crews and relief agencies. 
Several agencies, including the Federal Highway AdministrationManaging Pedestrians During Evacuation of Metropolitan Areas - Introduction and the City of Oklahoma have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing, and have proposed plans for a better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded streets, and the number of response agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma, in their After Action Report,http://www.ok.gov/OEM/documents/Bombing%20After%20Action%20Report.pdf declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aide of those in disastrous situations.
Following the events of September 11, 2001, with consideration of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased.Homeland Security Affairs: Article - Lessons We Don't Learn: A Study of the Lessons of Disasters, Why We Repeat Them, and How We Can Learn Them

==Memorial observances==

===Oklahoma City National Memorial===

For two years after the bombing the only memorials to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding the site of the building.[tpl]cite book|title=Tourists of History|last=Sturken|first=Marita|page=105|isbn=0-8223-4122-0[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Yardley|first=Jim|title=Uneasily, Oklahoma City Welcomes Tourists|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/11/us/uneasily-oklahoma-city-welcomes-tourists.html|date=June 11, 2001|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xGYKmfcr|archivedate=March 17, 2011[/tpl] Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996,[tpl]cite book|last=Linenthal|first=Edward|title=The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory|page=119|isbn=0-19-516107-6[/tpl] when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350 members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing.

The memorial includes a reflecting pool flanked by two large gates, one inscribed with the time 9:01, the other with 9:03, the pool representing the moment of the blast. On the south end of the memorial is a field of symbolic bronze and stone chairs—one for each person lost, arranged according to what floor of the building they were on. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The seats of the children killed are smaller than those of the adults lost. On the opposite side is the "survivor tree", part of the building's original landscaping that survived the blast and fires that followed it. The memorial left part of the foundation of the building intact, allowing visitors to see the scale of the destruction. Part of the chain link fence put in place around the site of the blast, which had attracted over 800,000 personal items of commemoration later collected by the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation, is now on the western edge of the memorial.White, Zachary.
