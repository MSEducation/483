A posset (also spelled poshote, poshotte) was a British hot drink of milk curdled with wine or ale, often spiced, which was popular from medieval times to the 19th century. The word is mainly used nowadays for a related dessert similar to syllabub. In the Middle Ages, it was used as a cold and flu remedy and was more of a drink than a mousse. 
To make the drink, milk was heated to a boil, then mixed with wine or ale, which curdled it, and the mixture was usually spiced.Item 130, An Ordinance of Pottage, Hieatt 1988.
It was considered a specific remedy for some minor illnesses, such as a cold, and a general remedy for others, as even today people drink hot milk to help them get to sleep.

==History==

The OED traces the word to the 15th century: various Latin vocabularies translate balducta, bedulta, or casius as "poshet", "poshoote", "possyt", or "possot".Oxford English Dictionary, "posset"  Russell's Boke of Nurture (c. 1460) lists various dishes and ingredients that "close a mannes stomak", including "횧e possate".  Posset is frequently used as a starting point for other recipes (e.g. "Make a styf Poshote of Milke an Ale", and "Take cowe Mylke, & set it ouer 횧e fyre, & 횧row 횧er-on Saunderys, & make a styf poshotte of Ale", each of which is the first sentence of a longer recipe).Harleian ms. 279, reprinted in Two Fifteenth Century Cookery Books, EETS 1888  Recipes for it appear in other 15th-century sources: boil milk, add either wine or ale "and no salt", let it cool, gather the curds and discard the whey, and season with ginger, sugar, and possibly "sweet wine" and candied anise.Item 130, Yale ms. Beinecke 163, edited and reprinted in An Ordinance of Pottage, Hieatt 1988"A posthot", Holkham ms. ???, edited and reprinted as A Noble Boke off Cookry ffor a Prynce Houssolde or Eny Other Estately Houssolde, Napier 1888
In 14th- and 15th-century cookery manuals, a possibly-related word spelled variously "possenet", "postnet", or "posnet" is used to mean a small pot or saucepan.Item 1, Diversa Cibaria; items 32, 54, Forme of Cury; item 26, Diuersa Servicia; item 32, Utilis Coquinario; all reprinted in Curye on Inglysch, Hieatt and Butler, 1985.Item 89, Harleian ms. 279; "Stwed Beef" and "Stwed Mutton", Harleian ms. 4016; both reprinted in Two Fifteenth Century Cookery Books, ibid.
In 16th-century and later sources, possets are generally made from lemon or other citrus juice, cream and sugar. Eggs are often added.
"Posset sets" for mixing and serving possets were popular gifts, and valuable ones (often made of silver) were heirlooms.  Such sets contained a posset "pot", or "bowl", or "cup" to serve it in, a container for mixing it in, and usually various containers for the ingredients, as well as spoons.  The posset set that the Spanish ambassador gave Queen Mary I of England and King Philip II of Spain when they became betrothed in 1554 is believed to have been made by Benvenuto Cellini and is of crystal, gold, precious gems, and enamel.  It is on display at Hatfield House in England and consists of a large, stemmed, covered bowl, two open, stemmed vessels, a covered container, three spoons, and two forks.
The word "posset" is mostly used nowadays for a cold set dessert loosely based on the drink, containing cream and lemon, similar to syllabub.  It is also used to refer to the semi-digested milk brought up by babies after a feed.[tpl]cite book|last=Waddilove|first=Rachel|title=The Babybook: How to Enjoy Year One|year=2006|publisher=Lion|location=Oxford|isbn=9780745952130|page=65|edition=1st[/tpl]
