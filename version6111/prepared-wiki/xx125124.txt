CATEGORIES: 2006 debut albums

Growing Flowers By Candlelight is the debut album by Ainslie Henderson, released independently in July 2006.  Written by Henderson and Hobotalk frontman Marc Pilley, it features original artwork by brothers Joseph and Tobias Feltus from design company FeltusFeltus, who also designed and created Henderson's official website.
Henderson signed and numbered the first 1000 copies of the CD,  which is available only from his official website and from the Edinburgh branches of Fopps and HMV.
The Daily Record described the album as "a reflective and introspective record which could find a home with fans of Damien Rice, Nick Drake and acoustic R.E.M.... littered with sparse and dusty story songs about girls, love and breakups."
In August 2006, tracks from the album received airplay during Jim Gellatly's evening radio show on XFM Scotland.
