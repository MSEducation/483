[[Scleronomous]]

CATEGORIES: Mechanics, Classical mechanics, Lagrangian mechanics

A mechanical system is scleronomous if the equations of constraints do not contain the time as an explicit variable. Such constraints are called scleronomic constraints.

==Application==

Velocity is the derivative of position with respect time.  Use chain rule for several variables:
Therefore,

Kinetic energy is a homogeneous function of degree 2 in generalized velocities .

==Example: pendulum==

As shown at right, a simple pendulum is a system composed of a weight and a string.  The string is attached at the top end to a pivot and at the bottom end to a weight.  Being inextensible, the stringâ€™s length is a constant.  Therefore, this system is scleronomous; it obeys scleronomic constraint
Take a more complicated example. Refer to the next figure at right, Assume the top end of the string is attached to a pivot point undergoing a simple harmonic motion
Although the top end of the string is not fixed, the length of this inextensible string is still a constant.  The distance between the top end and the weight must stay the same.  Therefore, this system is rheonomous; it obeys rheonomic constraint
