Grey Towers was a crenellated mansion with 85 acres of grounds on Hornchurch Road in Hornchurch, England. It was built in 1876 and brought into public use as the New Zealand Convalescent Hospital during the First World War. In the interwar period Hornchurch was developed as a suburb and Grey Towers was demolished to be used for housing.

===Demolition===

In the interwar period Hornchurch developed as a suburb of London and land was required for house building. Grey Towers was demolished in 1931. The driveway to the house is now a road of suburban houses called Grey Towers Avenue and the entrance gates were moved to Hylands Park. Towers Cinema opened on part of the site on 3 August 1935. The two lodges, built in the same crenellated style as the house survived to the 1960s and were used as dwellings.
