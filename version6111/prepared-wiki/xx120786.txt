Warner Channel (commonly shortened to WBTV, but not to be confused with the WB Television Network or Charlotte, North Carolina station WBTV, and currently referred to in promos as simply Warner in Latin America and WarnerTV in Asia) is a Latin American and Asian cable television channel owned by Time Warner's HBO Asia/HBO Latin America Group (as a joint venture with sister company Warner Bros.) that focuses on airing U.S. American-produced series and films. Most of the shows air in their original English language audio, with subtitles in Spanish (for Latin American countries except Brazil), Portuguese (for Brazil), Chinese (for Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore),  Malaysian (for Malaysia) and Indonesian (for Indonesia), but there are also some dubbed shows.
Warner Channel headquarters are located in Brazil, Venezuela, Chile, Singapore and Malaysia; the broadcasting, however, is generated in Miami for Latin American and Singapore for Asian viewers.
Most, but not all, series that air on the channel are in the Warner Bros. library.
