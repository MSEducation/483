[[Erbium]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Lanthanides, Erbium, Reducing agents

Erbium is a chemical element in the lanthanide series, with the symbol Er and atomic number 68. A silvery-white solid metal when artificially isolated, natural erbium is always found in chemical combination with other elements on Earth. As such, it is a rare earth element which is associated with several other rare elements in the mineral gadolinite from Ytterby in Sweden.
Erbium's principal uses involve its pink-colored Er3+ ions, which have optical fluorescent properties particularly useful in certain laser applications. Erbium-doped glasses or crystals can be used as optical amplification media, where erbium (III) ions are optically pumped at around 980 nm or 1480 nm and then radiate light at 1530 nm in stimulated emission. This process results in an unusually mechanically simple laser optical amplifier for signals transmitted by fiber optics. The 1550 nm wavelength is especially important for optical communications because standard single mode optical fibers have minimal loss at this particular wavelength. In addition to optical fiber lasers, a large variety of medical applications (i.e. dermatology, dentistry) utilize the erbium ion's 2940 nm emission (see Er:YAG laser), which is highly absorbed in water in tissues, making its effect very superficial. Such shallow tissue deposition of laser energy is helpful in laser surgery, and for the efficient production of steam for laser enamel ablation in laser dentistry.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===

A trivalent element, pure erbium metal is malleable (or easily shaped), soft yet stable in air, and does not oxidize as quickly as some other rare-earth metals. Its salts are rose-colored, and the element has characteristic sharp absorption spectra bands in visible light, ultraviolet, and near infrared. Otherwise it looks much like the other rare earths. Its sesquioxide is called erbia. Erbium's properties are to a degree dictated by the kind and amount of impurities present. Erbium does not play any known biological role, but is thought  to be able to stimulate metabolism.[tpl]cite book | title = Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements  | last = Emsley | first = John | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2001 | location = Oxford, England, UK | isbn = 0-19-850340-7 | chapter = Erbium | pages = 136–139 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC[/tpl]

==History==

Erbium (for Ytterby, a village in Sweden) was discovered by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1843.[tpl]cite journal|author=Mosander, C. G. |year=1843|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CJEOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA241|title=On the new metals, Lanthanium and Didymium, which are associated with Cerium; and on Erbium and Terbium, new metals associated with Yttria|journal=Philosophical Magazine|volume= 23|issue=152| pages =241–254[/tpl]  Note:  The first part of this article, which does NOT concern erbium, is a translation of:  C. G. Mosander (1842) "Något om Cer och Lanthan" (news) about cerium and lanthanum, Förhandlingar vid de Skandinaviske naturforskarnes tredje möte (Stockholm) of the Third Scandinavian Scientist Conference (Stockholm), vol. 3, pp. 387–398. Mosander separated "yttria" from the mineral gadolinite into three fractions which he called yttria, erbia, and terbia. He named the new element after the village of Ytterby where large concentrations of yttria and erbium are located. Erbia and terbia, however, were confused at this time. After 1860, terbia was renamed erbia and after 1877 what had been known as erbia was renamed terbia. Fairly pure Er2O3 was independently isolated in 1905 by Georges Urbain and Charles James. Reasonably pure metal wasn't produced until 1934 when Klemm and Bommer reduced the anhydrous chloride with potassium vapor. It was only in the 1990s that the price for Chinese-derived erbium oxide became low enough for erbium to be considered for use as a colorant in art glass.[tpl]cite book| pages =378–379| url =http://books.google.com/?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&pg=PA377| title = The development of modern chemistry| author= Ihde, Aaron John | publisher = Courier Dover Publications| year = 1984| isbn =0-486-64235-6[/tpl]

==Occurrence==

The concentration of erbium in the Earth crust is about 2.8 mg/kg and in the sea water 0.9 ng/L.[tpl]cite book | last =Patnaik | first =Pradyot  | year = 2003 | title =Handbook of Inorganic Chemical Compounds | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = 293–295| isbn =0-07-049439-8 |  url= http://books.google.com/?id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC&pg=PA293 | accessdate = 2009-06-06[/tpl] This concentration is enough to make erbium about 45th in elemental abundance in the Earth's crust.
Like other rare earths, this element is never found as a free element in nature but is found bound in monazite  sand ores. It has historically been very difficult and expensive to separate rare earths from each other in their ores but ion-exchange production techniquesEarly paper on the use of displacement ion-exchange chromatography to separate rare earths:  [tpl]cite journal | last1 = Spedding | first1 = F.H. | last2 = Powell | first2 = J.E. | year = 1954 | title = A practical separation of yttrium group rare earths from gadolinite by ion-exchange | url = | journal = Chemical Engineering Progress | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 7–15 [/tpl] developed in the late 20th century have greatly brought down the cost of production of all rare-earth metals and their chemical compounds.
The principal commercial sources of erbium are from the minerals xenotime and euxenite, and most recently, the ion adsorption clays of southern China; in consequence, China has now become the principal global supplier of this element. In the high-yttrium versions of these ore concentrates, yttrium is about two-thirds of the total by weight, and erbia is about 4–5%.  When the concentrate is dissolved in acid, the erbia liberates enough erbium ion to impart a distinct and characteristic pink color to the solution. This color behavior is similar to what Mosander and the other early workers in the lanthanides would have seen in their extracts from the gadolinite minerals of Ytterby.

==Production==

Crushed minerals are attacked by hydrochloric or sulfuric acid that transforms insoluble rare-earth oxides into soluble chlorides or sulfates. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) to pH 3–4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. The solution is treated with magnesium nitrate to produce a crystallized mixture of double salts of rare-earth metals. The salts are separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Erbium metal is obtained from its oxide or salts by heating with calcium at 1450 °C under argon atmosphere.

==Applications==

Erbium's everyday uses are varied. It is commonly used as a photographic filter, and because of its resilience it is useful as a metallurgical additive. Other uses:

==Biological role==

Erbium does not have a biological role, but erbium salts can stimulate metabolism. Humans consume 1 milligram of erbium a year on average. The highest concentration of erbium in humans is in the bones, but there is also erbium in the human kidneys and liver.

===Toxicity===

Erbium is slightly toxic if ingested, but erbium compounds are not toxic. Metallic erbium in dust form presents a fire and explosion hazard.[tpl]cite pmid|5921895[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1002/jps.2600540502[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1016/0041-008X(63)90067-X[/tpl]
