From 2000 to 2005, the band had been working as a back up musical band for Swedish singer Christina Lindberg under the name Christina Lindbergs orkester in addition to releasing albums in their own name and touring various Scandinavian countries. When Lindberg became pregnant and wanted to put her musical career on hold, the band decided to continue under the new name Stensons, after Kalle Stenson, the guitarist / saxophonist of the band.
