</ref>  Suffering from malignant [[melanoma]] and missing the first few months of the 1995–96 season, Robson still successfully led Porto in defence of their league title.<ref name=tactical/> Such was the success of the team Robson had created, that they managed to claim three more consecutive championships after he had left.
A phone call during the summer of 1996 from Barcelona's vice-president Joan Gaspart to discuss Luís Figo resulted in an offer of employment with the Spanish club. Robson took over in July 1996, where once again his assistant was Mourinho; Robson had made Mourinho's move with him to the Camp Nou a condition of his employment. One of the key decisions Robson made during his brief tenure at Barcelona was the US$19.5 million signing of Ronaldo, who was influential in a season when Barcelona won the Spanish Cup, Spanish Super Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup. Robson himself was voted European Manager of the Year for 1996–97, while Ronaldo stated, "as a trainer without doubt Robson is one of the greatest in the world".
The 1997–98 season saw Robson moved "upstairs" to the position of General Manager by Barcelona, with Louis van Gaal taking over the managerial reins,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-315978/Sir-Bobby-Robsons-career-highlights.html |title=Sir Bobby Robson's career highlights |publisher=Daily Mail |date=30 August 2004|accessdate=17 November 2013 |location=London[/tpl] but he stayed in this position for only one season before returning to manage PSV on a short-term deal for the 1998–99 season. PSV missed out on the league title, finishing third behind Feyenoord and Willem II, but Robson still led the club to victory in the Dutch supercup and also qualification for the Champions League on the last day of the season.

===Return to England===

After Robson's contract expired, he returned to England to take up a position in the Football Association's technical department, but following the resignation of Ruud Gullit at Newcastle United, Robson moved to St James' Park in September 1999. Robson was disappointed with the club's opening salary offer, stating "...it was miles below the going rate", but negotiated a one year, £1 million deal.
In Robson's first home match in charge, bottom-placed Newcastle faced second bottom Sheffield Wednesday, thrashing them 8–0. In his first season in charge, 1999–2000, Robson led the club to an 11th place finish, with 14 wins from his 32 games in charge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng00.html|title=England 1999/2000|work=rsssf.com|accessdate=26 August 2007[/tpl]  In late 2000, following the resignation of ex Magpies boss Kevin Keegan as England manager, the Football Association asked Newcastle Chairman Freddy Shepherd to permit Robson to take over in a part-time caretaker capacity but the request was refused.  Robson guided Newcastle from bottom of the Premier League to a fourth-place finish in the 2001–02 season. The following season, Newcastle finished third, ensuring qualification for the Champions League for the second consecutive year.
Despite the qualification of third place however, Robson was unable to guide Newcastle through the Champions League qualifying rounds and the club was pushed back into the UEFA Cup for the 2003–04 season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/aug/29/newsstory.sport4 |title=Newcastle pay price of failure , Football , The Guardian |work=The Guardian |location=UK |author=Michael Walker |date= 29 August 2003|accessdate=17 November 2013 [/tpl]  At the end of the 2003–04 season, Newcastle United finished fifth in the table, five points short of the Champions League qualifying fourth place but reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup before losing to Marseille.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/3685411.stm |title=Newcastle's Euro dream over|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=4 February 2013| date = 6 May 2004[/tpl]
Robson held the Newcastle post until 30 August 2004, when he was dismissed by Freddy Shepherd, after a poor start to the Premier League season and alleged discontent in the dressing room.  Robson's dismissal followed publication of his off the record observation of his disappointment that only 5,000 fans stayed to see the traditional lap of honour made by the players at St James' Park at the end of the previous season. However, he remains held in the highest esteem by the fans; he was granted the Freedom of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne on 2 March 2005.
Robson's autobiography, entitled Bobby Robson: Farewell but not Goodbye was released in 2005.
The title is based on one of his quotes upon leaving the England job in 1990: "I'm here to say goodbye—maybe not goodbye but farewell". In the book, Robson was critical of Shepherd, claiming that while manager he was denied information regarding the players' contracts and transfer negotiations. He also criticised Shepherd and the club's deputy chairman Douglas Hall, for their focus on the first team and St James' Park, causing them to neglect less glamorous issues, such as the training ground, youth development and talent scouts.  The club's training ground was later blamed by Graeme Souness, Robson's successor, for a series of injuries to first team players.

===Football consultant===

On 7 June 2005 Robson declined the invitation to become Director of Football of Heart of Midlothian because he wanted to stay in the Newcastle area.  On 13 January 2006, Steve Staunton was appointed manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, with Robson named in a support role as International Football Consultant. Robson stepped down from his role of consultant on 17 November 2007, after the Republic's final match in their unsuccessful qualifying campaign for Euro 2008. Robson was a former Vice President of the League Managers Association, a non-executive role.

===Personal life===

Robson met Elsie Gray on a trip back to his parents' home in Langley Park.  She was a student nurse, and later a teacher.  They were married in June 1955.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.medindia.net/news/view_news_main.asp?x=20669 |title=Bobby Robson diagnosed With Cancer for Fifth time |publisher=Medindia.net |date=7 May 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2009[/tpl]
