"My Love Is Like...Wo" is a song by American recording artist Mýa, released as the lead single from her third studio album, Moodring (2003). Mýa re-teamed up with rapper Missy Elliott after the global success of "Lady Marmalade" (2001) to record the song. Before being released, it took Mýa a whole year to decide to record the song because of its graphic lyrical content. The song was written by Elliott along with brothers Charles and Kenneth Bereal. Lyrically, the mid-tempo song is about self-love.
The song received generally mixed to positive reviews from contemporary music critics, applauding Mýa for her newfound sexual freedom. "My Love Is Like...Wo" became a top twenty hit on the Billboard Hot 100 for week of September 6, 2003; peaking and spending four consecutive weeks at number thirteen. It performed similarly on Billboard[tpl]'[/tpl]s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where it peaked at number seventeen. Internationally, the single charted within the top forty in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. 
The song's accompanying music video was filmed by director Paul Hunter, who envisioned Harrison to perform a one-woman show. The video earned her two nominations at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Dance Video and Best Choreography, while choreographer Travis Payne garnered a nomination at the American Choreography Awards for Outstanding Achievement – Music Video.

==Background and composition==

Recorded in 2001, "My Love Is Like...Wo" was written and produced by American rapper Missy Elliott along with production duo CKB, consisting of brothers Charles and Kenneth Bereal. Additional production on the song was handled by Ron Fair. Before Harrison decided to release "My Love Is...Wo" as the first single from Moodring (2003), she admitted she was not always comfortable with the song and its graphic lyric content. Speaking to Billboard magazine, she explained, "Back then, I wasn't so confident in saying, 'My a** is like wo' ... I was coming out of doing a program with young girls that talked about self-esteem and body image. I realized that I really couldn't worry about what people think of me. I'm at that point in my life now where I can say, 'My ass is like wo.' I wasn't even considering the song to be on the album at that time, but I later fought for it to be the single."[tpl]cite journal |last=Hall |first=Rashaun |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/70355/music-best-fits-myas-mood |title=Music Best Fits Mya's 'Mood' |journal=Billboard |page=13 |volume=115 |issue=27 |date=July 5, 2003 |accessdate=November 30, 2012[/tpl]

==Critical reception==

Billboard magazine gave the song a positive review:
 
 "The doe-eyed girl next door is proving to be quite a versatile performer, with a decidedly vampish performance in the movie Chicago and new imaging that redresses Mýa as a sexy and certain young woman. The first single from forthcoming Moodring ... is a playfully coy call to arms for the singer's more tactile attributes, from her love, her kiss, and her touch to her sex, ass, and body—all of which 'are like wo.' Get it? An appropriately hip-swaying beat swirls around the vocal, courtesy of ever-hitworthy producer Missy Elliott. This is the record that will propel Mýa to the A-list among today's pop/R&B icons; throughout the song, she delivers womanly strength and sass with a knowing wink. Moodring sounds like a perfect fit."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/70600/my-love-is-like-wo |title=My Love Is Like . . .

The video was filmed and directed by Paul Hunter, who had previously worked with Mýa on "Lady Marmalade" (2001) with Christina Aguilera, Pink, Lil' Kim, and Missy Elliott. His concept for the video was to have Mýa act as a one-woman show. Although this initially was not Mýa's vision or idea for the song's video, she agreed to it.
