Seamus Leydon is a Gaelic footballer from County Galway. He was a vital part of Galway’s great "Three In A Row" side of the Mid 60’s.http://www.hoganstand.com/Galway/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=88755 The "Dunmore Dynamo" was the scourge of all right half backs up and down the county for a decade.
The groundwork for Seamus’ outstanding career was laid from an early stage. He attended the great footballing college, St. Jarlath's College of Tuam, the home of so much football tradition. In 1960, the Dunmore man helped St. Jarlath's to an All-Ireland Colleges Championship. That year Leydon was also in the Galway Minor team which convincingly won the All-Ireland title, winning the Connacht final against Roscommon by 20 points and then overwhelming Cork in the All-Ireland final, 4-09 to 1-05.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
His first Connacht Senior medal came in ’63 when Galway hammered Leitrim by 14 points in the final. They then accounted for Kerry in the All-Ireland semi final by four points. They lost to Dublin in the final but the big breakthrough came the next year when Kerry were toppled by the Connacht champions in the final, with Seamus marking Denis O’Sullivan, one of many formidable wing backs he came up against in his time. Further success was to follow for the tribesmen when Enda Colleran captained them to another victory over Kerry in the ’65 final and a six point win in the decider against Meath the following September. That victory ensured a memorable "Three In A Row" for Galway. It would be 32 years before the county would win another one. Seamus featured in the 1971 final when Offaly beat them by three points.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
The Dunmore man himself quit the intercounty scene in 1972 when his job with Cantrell and Cochrane forced him to move to Cork to take up a position as regional manager for Munster. After having won six or seven Galway Championships with Dunmore, he started playing for Nemo Rangers in Cork who, at that time, didn’t enjoy the same reputation nationally as they do now as one of the best club footballing sides in Ireland. Since that time Nemo Rangers have won several All-Ireland Club Championships but Seamus’ only final came in 1975 when they were beaten by two points by a very strong UCD side.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
In 1999, Seamus was voted on the Galway "Team Of The Millennium".[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
