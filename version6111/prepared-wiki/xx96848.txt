Carl H. Storck (born January 22, 1887 â€“ March 13, 1950) was a co-founder of the National Football League, as well as the founding owner of the Dayton Triangles. He was also the Triangles coach from 1922 until 1926. Storck served as the secretary-treasurer of the NFL from 1921 to 1939. Upon the death of Joe Carr, he served as president of the National Football League. Citing ill health, Storck only held the title of president until 1941.
Storck started his football career as a local football hero in Dayton, Ohio, playing for St. Mary's College (now known as the University of Dayton). After graduation, Stork played semi-pro football for a local team that would later become the Dayton Triangles. Storck became the team's manager in 1918 and guide his team into the NFL (then called the American Professional Football Association). He represented Dayton at Ralph Hay's Hupmobile dealership on September 17, 1920. This meeting marked the formation of the NFL. Like nearly all managers, Storck was an unpaid volunteer; he also worked full-time as a foreman in the Inspection and Packing Department at the National Cash Register Company.
The Triangles would have trouble competing in the increasingly competitive NFL, and Storck would eventual sell them in 1930 to Bill Dwyer, who moved the team to Brooklyn and renamed them the Brooklyn Dodgers.
