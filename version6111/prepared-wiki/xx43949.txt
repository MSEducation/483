The year 1939 in motion pictures is widely considered the most outstanding one ever,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-1939-the-best-year-f_b_86897.html|title=Michael Giltz: DVDs: 1939 – The Best Year For Movies...Ever!|last=Giltz|first=Michael|date=February 15, 2008|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=January 10, 2012[/tpl] when it comes to the high quality and high attendance at the large set of the best films that premiered in the year (considered as a percentage of the population in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom at that time).

==Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture==

1939 was one of the years in which the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated ten films for Best Picture:
These films came from a wide variety of film genres and sources for their stories and settings, including these:
Historical novels (Gone with the Wind), contemporary affairs (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Of Mice and Men), love stories, classic novels (Wuthering Heights), a fantasy-musical (The Wizard of Oz), a tragedy (Dark Victory), a story of the Old West (Stagecoach), and a comedy (Ninotchka).
The five nominees for Best Director of 1939 all went on to become legendary film directors with multiple stellar films to their credit. [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] In alphabetical order: Frank Capra, Victor Fleming, John Ford, Sam Wood, and William Wyler.

These figures are not necessarily the sums that were taken in during 1939 – and in particularly for films that made their premieres in October, November, and December. Note that the number one film in this list premiered in mid-December, and it certainly did not take in $200,000,000 in December 1939.  At the time, box office numbers were reported as a percentage of business for each theater in comparison to 'normal' business. For example, Jesse James performed at 182% and The Wizard of Oz at 156%.  This puts the astounding 388% that Gone with the Wind performed at in perspective for the time.  This type of reporting is why exact dollar grosses for films of this period are unreliable at best.
