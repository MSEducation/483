==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars and states "The music falls between funky soul-jazz and hard bop, and each of the performances (particularly "Star Eyes" and "Well You Needn't") is enjoyable".Yanow, S. Allmusic Review accessed 20 October 2009 The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album 3 stars stating "''Plus brings in Wynton Kelly on a few tracks, enabling Feldman to play some more vibes, but it's otherwise a routine Adderley band date".
