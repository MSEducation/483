Catherine "Kate" Bush, CBE (born 30 July 1958)[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3805|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=allmusic ((( Kate Bush > Biography ))) |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=20 May 2009 |last= Eder|first= Bruce[/tpl] is an English singer-songwriter, musician and record producer. Her eclectic musical style and idiosyncratic vocal style have made her one of the United Kingdom's most successful solo female performers of the past 35 years.
In 1978, at the age of 19, Bush topped the UK Singles Chart for four weeks with her debut single "Wuthering Heights", becoming the first woman to have a UK number one with a self-written song.[tpl]cite news|author=Graeme Thomson |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/may/13/kate-bush-only-tour-live |title=Kate Bush's only tour: pop concert or disappearing act? The Guardian 13 May 2010 |work=The Guardian  |date= 13 May 2010|accessdate=29 May 2010|location=London[/tpl] She has since released ten albums, three of which topped the UK Albums Chart. She has had 25 UK Top 40 hit singles, including the Top 10 hits "Wuthering Heights", "The Man with the Child in His Eyes", "Babooshka", "Running Up that Hill",  "Don't Give Up" (a duet with Peter Gabriel) and "King of the Mountain".
In 1987, she won a Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist, and in 2002, her song writing ability was recognised with an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.  During the course of her career, she has also been nominated for three Grammy Awards. After her 1979 tour – the only concert tour of her career before 2014 – Bush released the 1980 album Never for Ever, which made her the first British solo female artist to top the UK album charts and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at Number 1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/albuminfo.php?id=5079 |title=Kate Bush – Never For Ever |publisher=Chart Stats |accessdate=29 May 2010|archiveurl=http://archive.is/85bC|archivedate=28 July 2012[/tpl] She is also the first (and to date only) female artist to have Top 5 albums in the UK charts in five successive decades.
Bush was appointed Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to music.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20860327|title=BBC News - New Year Honours 2013: At a glance|work=BBC Online|accessdate=29 December 2012|date=29 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]LondonGazette |issue=60367 |date=29 December 2012 |startpage=7 |supp=yes [/tpl] She received the award from Queen Elizabeth II on 10 April 2013 at Windsor Castle.[tpl]cite web|last=McAlpine|first=Fraser|title=Kate Bush Takes Her CBE From The Queen|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2013/04/kate-bush-takes-her-cbe-from-the-queen/|publisher=BBC America|accessdate=12 April 2013[/tpl]

==Early life==

Bush was born in Welling, Kent (now London), to English medical doctor Robert Bush and his Irish wife, Hannah Daly.[tpl]cite news|title = Kate Bush: Return of the recluse|work=The Independent |author=Sweeting, Adam|url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/kate-bush-return-of-the-recluse-509224.html| date =2 October 2005|accessdate =15 May 2008|location=London[/tpl] She was raised as a Roman Catholic[tpl]cite news|title = Kate Bush @ Paradise Place – Q interview.|work=Q |url = http://www.paradiseplace.org.uk/Kate/Katep15.htm| date =2 September 1999|accessdate =30 June 2012[/tpl] in their farmhouse in East Wickham with her older brothers, John and Paddy.[tpl]cite web |title = Kate Bush |publisher=Salon.com|url = http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/03/20/kate_bush/index.html |accessdate =22 April 2007 [/tpl] Bush came from an artistic background: her mother was a former Irish folk dancer, her father was an accomplished pianist, Paddy worked as a musical instrument maker and John was a poet and photographer. Both brothers were involved in the local folk music scene.[tpl]cite news  |last=Young |first=David |title = Haunting Kate Bush |work=NZ Listener |date=2 December 1978 [/tpl]
John was a karateka at Goldsmiths College karate club and Kate also trained there, becoming known as "Ee-ee" because of her squeaky kiai. One of the instructors, Dave Hazard, later noted in his autobiography that her dance moves seemed to owe something to karate.[tpl]cite book |title= Born Fighter|last= Hazard|first= Dave|year= 2007|publisher=John Blake Publishing|location= London|isbn= 978-1-84454-480-6|page= 114[/tpl]
Her family's musical influence inspired the young Kate to teach herself to play the piano at the age of 11. She also played the organ in a barn behind her parents' house and studied the violin.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3805|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Allmusic Kate Bush Biography[/tpl] She soon began writing her own tunes and eventually added lyrics to them.[tpl]cite book|last = Gaar|first = Gillian|title = She's a Rebel |year=1993 [/tpl]

==Career==

Bush attended St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, South East London, in the mid-1970s. During this time her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which was turned down by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded that would be more saleable to the record companies.[tpl]cite news |last = Cowley |first = Jason |title = The Wow Factor |work=New Statesman |date=7 February 2005[/tpl] Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour.Rolling Stone magazine, 8 February 1990, pp 21–2:  "The Sensual Woman" by Sheila Rogers. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick.[tpl]cite journal |title=The Rightful Heir?| work=Q |number= 48 |date=September 1990[/tpl] The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her.[tpl]cite web |title = Kate Bush |publisher=EMI|url = http://www.emi-premier.co.uk/loader.html |accessdate =3 April 2007 [/tpl] The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/TRA/Kate_Bush.shtml |title=Kate Bush: Enigmatic chanteuse as pop pioneer |last=Kruse |first=Holly |date=November 2000 |journal=Soundscapes.info, Online Journal on Media Culture|volume=3 |issn=1567-7745 |accessdate=7 May 2009  [/tpl], Originally published in [tpl]cite journal|title=Tracking: Popular Music Studies |year=1988|volume=1 |issue=1[/tpl] Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.
Bush was put on retainer for two years by Bob Mercer, managing director of EMI group-repertoire division. According to Mercer he felt Bush's material was good enough to be released but felt that if the album failed it would be demoralising and if it was successful Bush was too young to handle it.http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UyFOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QRMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6211,4646428&dq=kate-bush&hl=en [tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] For the first two years of her contract, Bush spent more time on school work than making an album. She left school after doing her mock A-levels and having gained ten GCE O-Level qualifications.[tpl]cite news |last = Williamson |first = Nigel |title = The Mighty Bush |work=Scotland on Sunday|date=2 October 2005[/tpl] In 2005, Bush stated in an interview with Mark Radcliffe on BBC Radio 2 that she believed EMI signed her before she was ready to make an album so that no other record company could offer her a contract. After the contract signing, EMI forwarded her a sizeable advance which she used to enroll in interpretive dance classes taught by Lindsay Kemp, a former teacher of David Bowie,[tpl]cite news |title = Today's Style And Looks |work=Face & Figure  |year=1979 [/tpl] and mime training with Adam Darius.Darius, A. (1984) The Adam Darius Method, page 236–240. Latonia. ISBN 0-9502707-2-5 Mime Centre
Bush also wrote and made demos of close to 200 songs, a few of which today can be found on bootleg recordings and are known as the Phoenix Recordings.[tpl]cite web |title = Demos: The Phoenix recordings |publisher=Last.fm|url = http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/Demos%253A+The+Phoenix+recordings+%252F+Studio+Sessions |accessdate =3 April 2007 [/tpl] From March to August 1977, she fronted the KT Bush Band at public houses around London – specifically at the Rose of Lee public house (now Dirty South) in Lewisham. The other three band members were Del Palmer (bass), Brian Bath (guitar), and Vic King (drums). She began recording her first album in August 1977, although two tracks had been recorded during the summer of 1975.

===The Kick Inside and Lionheart===

As part of her preparation for entering the studio, Bush toured pubs with the KT Bush Band. However, for her début album The Kick Inside (1978) she was persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain even after she had brought her bandmates back on board.[tpl]cite web |title = Kate Bush Biography |publisher=Lyricsystem.com|url = http://www.lyricsystem.com/kate-bush/ |accessdate =22 April 2007 [/tpl] Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin, unlike on later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as the balalaika and didgeridoo. Stuart Elliott played some of the drums and would become her main drummer on subsequent albums.[tpl]cite book |title = Lyrics booklets from Kate Bush's albums|publisher=EMI [/tpl]
Bush released The Kick Inside when she was 19 years old, but some of the songs had been written when she was as young as 13. EMI originally wanted the more rock-oriented track "James and the Cold Gun" to be her début single, but Bush insisted that it should be "Wuthering Heights". Even at this early stage of her career, she had gained a reputation for her determination to have a say in decisions affecting her work. "Wuthering Heights" topped the UK and Australian charts and became an international hit.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/kate%20bush/#singles |title=Kate Bush in the UK singles charts |work=The Official Charts |accessdate=21 January 2012[/tpl] Bush became the first woman to reach number one in the UK charts with a self-penned song.[tpl]cite news|last = Barkham |first = Patrick|title = Guardian profile: Kate Bush|url = http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1581815,00.html|work=The Guardian |date=30 September 2005|accessdate =10 September 2007|location=London[/tpl] A second single, "The Man with the Child in His Eyes", reached number six in the UK charts.[tpl]cite web |title = The Man with the Child in His Eyes |publisher=Songfacts.com|url = http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4831 |accessdate =22 April 2007 [/tpl] It also made it onto the American Billboard Hot 100 where it reached number 85 in early 1979. Bob Mercer felt that Bush's relative lack of success in the United States compared to the rest of the world was due to her music being a poor fit for American radio formats and that there were no outlets for the visual presentation central to Bush's appeal. "The Man with the Child in His Eyes" went on to win her an Ivor Novello Award in 1979 for Outstanding British Lyric.[tpl]cite news|title = Awards Database|publisher=The Envelope|url = http://theenvelope.latimes.com |accessdate =3 April 2007 [/tpl]
EMI capitalised on Bush's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top that emphasised her breasts. In an interview with NME magazine in 1982, Bush criticised the marketing technique, stating: "People weren't even generally aware that I wrote my own songs or played the piano. The media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist in a female body." In late 1978, EMI persuaded Bush to quickly record a follow-up album, Lionheart, to take advantage of the success of The Kick Inside. Bush has often expressed dissatisfaction with Lionheart, feeling that she had needed more time to get it right. The album was produced by Andrew Powell, assisted by Bush. While it had spawned several hit singles, most notably "Wow", it did not garner the same reception as her first album, reaching number six in the UK album charts.[tpl]cite book |title = The Whole Story album lyrics booklet |publisher=EMI |year=1986  [/tpl]
Bush was displeased with being rushed into making the second album. She set up her own publishing company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors. Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour, the only one of her career.[tpl]cite news|title=Stand By Your Mantra |work=Classic Rock |year=2004[/tpl] The tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.magicweek.co.uk/magic_profiles/magicprofile_0001_simon_drake.htm|title=Simon Drake – The Illusionist|year=2000|publisher=magicweek.co.uk|accessdate=15 March 2011[/tpl] Typical of her determination to have control, she was involved in every aspect of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.[tpl]cite news| last=Badhorn|first=Philippe|title=Interview in Rolling Stone (France)|work=Rolling Stone |date=February 2006[/tpl]

===Never for Ever and The Dreaming===

Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first time as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker "Violin" to the wistful waltz of hit single "Army Dreamers".

Never for Ever was the first Kate Bush album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top. The top-selling single from the album was "Babooshka", which reached number five in the UK singles chart.[tpl]cite web  |title = Kate Bush|publisher=UnderGroundOnline|url = http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?artist=katebush&cat=Alternative&full=Kate%20Bush |accessdate =27 July 2007 [/tpl] In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single "December Will Be Magic Again", which reached number 29 in the UK charts.
September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself.[tpl]cite news  |title = Something from Kate, at last|work=The Age |location=Australia| url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/something-from-kate/2005/10/06/1128562936076.html?page=3| date = 8 October 2005 |accessdate =21 November 2010 [/tpl] With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed critical reception in the UK, and many were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become "less accessible".Smash Hits magazine, reviews of The Dreaming (September 1982) In a 1993 interview with Q, Bush stated: "That was my 'She's gone mad' album." However, the album became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart, albeit only reaching number 157. The album entered the UK album chart at number three, but is to date her lowest-selling album, garnering only a silver disc.
"Sat in Your Lap" was the first single from the album to be released. It pre-dated the album by over a year and peaked at number 11 in the UK.[tpl]cite web  |title =  Kate Bush| publisher=TheOfficialCharts.com|url = http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/kate%20bush/|accessdate =21 November 2010 [/tpl] The album's title track, featuring the talents of Rolf Harris and Percy Edwards, stalled at number 48, while the third single, "There Goes a Tenner", failed to chart, despite promotion from EMI and Bush. The track "Suspended in Gaffa" was released as a single in Europe, but not in the UK.
Continuing in her storytelling tradition, Bush looked far outside her own personal experience for sources of inspiration. She drew on old crime films for "There Goes a Tenner", a documentary about the war in Vietnam for "Pull Out the Pin", and the plight of Indigenous Australians for "The Dreaming". "Houdini" is about the magician's death, and "Get Out of My House" was inspired by Stephen King's novel The Shining.[tpl]cite journal |title=Dreamtime Is Over |author=Simper, Paul |work=Melody Maker |date=16 October 1982[/tpl]

===Hounds of Love and The Whole Story===

Hounds of Love was released in 1985. Because of the high cost of hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace.[tpl]cite news|last = Ellen| first =Barbara| title = Comeback Kate|work=The Observer | url = http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1582789,00.html|date =2 October 2005| accessdate =4 April 2007|location=London[/tpl] Hounds of Love ultimately topped the charts in the UK, knocking Madonna's Like a Virgin from the number one position.[tpl]cite book |last = Fitzgerald Morris |first = Peter |title = Hounds of Love lyrics booklet  |publisher=EMI |year=1997[/tpl]
The album takes advantage of the vinyl and cassette formats with two very different sides. The first side, Hounds of Love, contains five "accessible" pop songs, including the four singles "Running Up that Hill", "Cloudbusting", "Hounds of Love", and "The Big Sky". "Running Up that Hill" reached number 3 in the UK charts and also re-introduced Bush to American listeners, climbing to number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1985. The second side of the album, The Ninth Wave, takes its name from Tennyson's poem, "Idylls of the King", about the legendary King Arthur's reign, and is seven interconnecting songs joined in one continuous piece of music.[tpl]cite news |title = Kate Bush radio interview|publisher=Rock Over London with Paul Cooke  |year=1985 [/tpl]
The album earned Bush nominations for Best Female Solo Artist, Best Album, Best Single, and Best Producer at the 1986 BRIT Awards. In the same year, Bush and Peter Gabriel had a UK top ten hit with the duet "Don't Give Up" (Dolly Parton, Gabriel's original choice to sing the female vocal, turned his offer down),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/peter-gabriel/59311|title=Peter Gabriel: 'Kate Bush replaced Dolly Parton on 'Don't Give Up NME 19 September 2011|work=NME|date=19 September 2011|accessdate=16 January 2012[/tpl] and EMI released her "greatest hits" album, The Whole Story''. Bush provided a new lead vocal and refreshed backing track on "Wuthering Heights," and recorded a new single, "Experiment IV," for inclusion on the compilation. At the 1987 BRIT Awards, Bush won the award for Best Female Solo Artist.

===The Sensual World and The Red Shoes===

The increasingly personal tone of her writing continued on 1989's The Sensual World. One of the quirkiest tracks on the album, touched by Bush's black humour, is "Heads We're Dancing", about a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to discover in the morning that he is Adolf Hitler. The title track drew its inspiration from James Joyce's novel Ulysses.[tpl]cite web |title = Kate Bush's dream world|work=The Telegraph|url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2fYlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TfwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=7016,7079481&dq=hitler+heads-we-re-dancing+kate-bush&hl=en|date = 26 November 1989|accessdate =21 November 2010 [/tpl]
The Sensual World went on to become her biggest-selling album in the US, receiving an RIAA Gold certification four years after its release for 500,000 copies sold. In the United Kingdom album charts, it reached the number two position.[tpl]cite web |title = Kate Bush Biography |publisher=Starpulse.com|url = http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Bush,_Kate/Biography/ |accessdate =22 April 2007 [/tpl]

In 1990, the boxed-set This Woman's Work was released and included all of her albums with their original cover art, as well as two discs of all single B sides recorded from 1978 to 1990. In 1991, Bush released a cover of Elton John's "Rocket Man", which reached number 12 in the UK singles chart,[tpl]cite web|title =UK Top 40 Hit Database|publisher=EveryHit.com|url = http://www.everyhit.com/|accessdate =15 May 2008 [/tpl] and went as high as number two in Australia, and in 2007, was voted the greatest cover ever by readers of The Observer newspaper.[tpl]cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/ttremastered/story/0,,2166706,00.html|work=The Observer |title = The top 50 greatest covers as voted by you|accessdate =26 October 2007|location=London[/tpl] She recorded "Candle in the Wind", as the single's b-side.[tpl]cite book |title=The Great Rock Discography |last=Strong |first=Martin|year=1994 |publisher=Cannongate |isbn=1-84195-615-5 |page=218[/tpl]
Bush's seventh studio album, The Red Shoes, was released in November 1993. The album features more high-profile cameo appearances than her previous efforts, including contributions from composer and conductor Michael Kamen, comedy actor Lenny Henry, Prince, Eric Clapton, Gary Brooker of Procol Harum, Trevor Whittaker, and Jeff Beck. Both The Sensual World and The Red Shoes featured contributions from Trio Bulgarka, the Bulgarian female vocal trio who sang on several tracks including "You're The One" and "Rocket's Tail". The album gave Bush her highest chart position in the US, reaching number 28, although the only song from the album to make the US singles chart was "Rubberband Girl", which peaked at number 88 in January 1994. In the UK, the album reached number two, and the singles "Rubberband Girl", "The Red Shoes", "Moments of Pleasure", and "And So Is Love" all reached the top 30.[tpl]cite web |title = Back On Stage After 12 Years |publisher=Softpedia.com|url = http://news.softpedia.com/news/Kate-Bush-Back-On-Stage-After-12-Years-7653.shtml |accessdate =23 April 2007 [/tpl] In 1994, Bush released an accompanying short film, The Line, the Cross & the Curve. Written, directed by, and starring Bush, along with English actress Miranda Richardson,[tpl]cite web |title = The Line, The Cross & The Curve  |publisher=Amazon.co.uk|url = http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00003JA23 |accessdate =23 April 2007 [/tpl] the film was based around the concept of The Red Shoes and featured six of the songs from the album.
The initial plan had been to take the songs out on the road, but no new tour transpired. Thus, Bush deliberately aimed for a live-band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and which would have been too difficult to re-create on stage.[tpl]cite news |title = Well red |work=Future Music  |date=November 1993[/tpl] The result alienated some of her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions,[tpl]cite news |last = Gettelman|first = Parry|title = The Red Shoes review |work=The Orlando Sentinel  |year=1993[/tpl] but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.[tpl]cite news |title = The Red Shoes review |work=Request |date=November 1993[/tpl]
This period had been a troubled time for Bush. She had suffered a series of bereavements, including the loss of guitarist Alan Murphy, who had started working with her on The Tour of Life in 1979, and her mother Hannah, to whom she was exceptionally close. Many of the people she lost are honoured in the ballad "Moments of Pleasure." However, Bush's mother was still alive when "Moments of Pleasure" was written and recorded. Bush describes playing the song to her mother, who thought the line where she is quoted by Bush as saying, "Every old sock meets an old shoe," was hilarious and "couldn't stop laughing."[tpl]cite web|title=Interview with Ken Bruce on Radio 2 09 May 2011|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gtnyf|work=Radio 2|accessdate=9 May 2011[/tpl]

After the release of The Red Shoes, Bush dropped out of the public eye for many years, although her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours of a new album release.

===Director's Cut===

On 16 May 2011, Bush released the album Director's Cut.  The album, which Bush has described as an entirely new project rather than a collection of mere remixes, contains 11 tracks of substantially reworked material from her earlier albums The Sensual World and The Red Shoes, all of which have been recorded using analogue, rather than digital, equipment to create "a warmer sound". All the tracks have new lead vocals, new drums, and radically reworked instrumentation. Some of them have been transposed to a lower key to accommodate her lowering voice. Three of the songs, including "This Woman's Work", have been completely re-recorded, with lyrics often changed in places.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b010vxyv/Front_Row_Kate_Bush_in_a_rare_interview_and_John_Cleese_reviewed/ |title=BBC iPlayer - Front Row: Kate Bush in a rare interview; and John Cleese reviewed |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-05-04 |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl] The album has been met with a wide range of reviews with most reviewers a bit confused about the concept of the album itself, while responding with varying degrees of enthusiasm about its revamped tracks. Of particular note is the warmer, more intimate tone of the songs and the richer, more mature sound of her voice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.katebushnews.com/index.php/page/2/ |title=Kate Bush News |publisher=Katebushnews.com |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.katebushnews.com/index.php/page/1/ |title=Kate Bush News |publisher=Katebushnews.com |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl] This is the first album on her new label, Fish People, a division of EMI Records, with whom she's had a relationship since she started recording. In addition to the album Director's Cut in both its single CD form and in a box-set with The Sensual World and the analogue re-mastered The Red Shoes, Fish People will be releasing re-mastered editions of The Hounds of Love and The Dreaming.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.katebushnews.com/ |title=Kate Bush News |publisher=Katebushnews.com |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl] The album debuted at number 2 on the United Kingdom chart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/471173/pitbull-tops-uk-singles-chart-kate-bush-album-debuts-at-no-2 |title=Pitbull Tops U.K. Singles Chart; Kate Bush Album Debuts At No. 2 |publisher=Billboard |date=2011-05-23 |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl]
The song "The Sensual World" has been renamed "Flower of the Mountain" and contains a passage of Molly Bloom's famous soliloquy from James Joyce's novel Ulysses. Bush said, "Originally when I wrote the song "The Sensual World", I had used text from the end of Ulysses. When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then wrote my own lyrics for the song, although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting. Well, I'm not James Joyce am I? When I came to work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes."[tpl]cite web|author=Sean Michaels |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/apr/05/kate-bush-new-album-james-joyce |title=Kate Bush reveals guest lyricist on new album – James Joyce | Culture |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl]
The first single released from the album was "Deeper Understanding" and contains a new chorus featuring computerised vocals from Bush's son, Albert. A video for the song, directed by Bush, has been released through her channel on YouTube. It features Robbie Coltrane as a man consumed by his relationship with his computer (voiced by Bush's son). Frances Barber plays the man's wife, and Noel Fielding also appears.

===50 Words for Snow===

Bush's next studio album, 50 Words for Snow, was released on 21 November 2011. The album contains seven new songs "set against a backdrop of falling snow," with a total running time of 65 minutes.[tpl]cite web|first=Matthew|last=Perpetua|authorlink=Matthew Perpetua|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kate-bush-first-new-album-in-six-years-20110912|title=Kate Bush: First New Album in Six Years|work=Rolling Stone|date=12 September 2011|accessdate=12 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.katebush.com/news/kate-release-brand-new-album-50-words-snow-november |title=News |publisher=Kate Bush |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl] A radio edit of the first single, "Wild Man," was played on BBC Radio 2's 'Ken Bruce' show on 10 October.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/kate-bush/12361|title=Review of "Wild Man"|work=NME|date=10 October 2011|accessdate=16 January 2012[/tpl] and was released as a digital download on 11 October.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.katebush.com/news/wildman-single-released-11-october |title=Fish People |publisher=Katebush.com |accessdate=16 January 2012[/tpl] The album is distributed in the United States by Anti-Records.

The album's songs are built around Bush's quietly jazzy piano and Steve Gadd's drums, and utilise both sung and spoken word vocals in what Classic Rock's Stephen Dalton calls "a ... supple and experimental affair, with a comtemporary chamber pop sound grounded in crisp piano, minimal percussion and light-touch electronics ... billowing jazz-rock soundscapes, interwoven with fragmentary narratives delivered in a range of voices from shrill to Laurie Anderson-style cooing."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.katebushnews.com/index.php/author/peter/ |title=Stephen Dalton describes 50 Words for Snow |publisher=Katebushnews.com |accessdate=16 January 2012[/tpl] Bassist Danny Thompson appears on the album, which also features performances by Elton John and actor Stephen Fry.
On the first track, "Snowflake," in a song written specifically to use his still high choir-boy voice,[tpl]cite web|url=http://avro.nl/audioplayer/?p=podcast_schiffersxtra&pc=schiffersxtra_17391&stream=undefined |title=Bush tells Jamie Cullum "Snowflake" was written for her son |publisher=Avro.nl |accessdate=16 January 2012[/tpl] Bush's son Albert (Bertie) sings the role of a falling snowflake in a song expressing the hope of a noisy world soon being hushed by snowfall. "Snowflake" drifts into "Lake Tahoe", where choral singer Stefan Roberts and Bush sing about a rarely seen ghost: a woman who appears in a Victorian gown to call to her dog, Snowflake. Bush explained to fellow musician Jamie Cullum in an interview on Dutch Radio[tpl]cite web|url=http://avro.nl/audioplayer/?p=podcast_schiffersxtra&pc=schiffersxtra_17391&stream=undefined |title=Bush explains decisions regarding 50 Words for Snow |publisher=Avro.nl |accessdate=16 January 2012[/tpl] that she wished to explore using high male voices in contrast to her own, deeper, voice. "Misty" is about a snowman lover who melts away after a night of passion, while "Wild Man" tells the story of a group of climbers in the Himalayas who, upon finding evidence of a nearby Yeti, erase all traces of it to protect it from discovery. Elton John and Bush as eternally divided lovers trade vocals on "Snowed in at Wheeler Street", while Stephen Fry recites the "50 Words for Snow". The quiet "Among Angels" finishes the album.[tpl]cite news|author=Greg Kot Music critic 11:35 am CST, 18 November 2011 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/turnitup/chi-kate-bush-album-review-50-words-for-snow-reviewed-20111118,0,6147350.column |title=Chicago Tribune review of 50 Words for Snow |work= Chicago Tribune  |date=18 November 2011 |accessdate=16 January 2012[/tpl]

Bush released an exclusive limited-edition 10" picture disc of the 2012 remix of Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God) as part of Record Store Day 2013 on 20 April 2013.

==Musical style==

Bush has a soprano vocal range.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2005-11-17-kate-bush_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Elysa | last1=Gardner | title=Kate Bush picks it up in 'Aerial' | date=17 November 2005[/tpl] Her music is eclectic, varying styles even within an album. Her songs span genres as diverse as rock, pop, alternative and art rock. Even in her earliest works where the piano was a primary instrument, she wove together many diverse influences, combining classical music, rock, and a wide range of ethnic and folk sources, and this has continued throughout her career.
In an interview with Melody Maker magazine in 1977, she revealed that male artists had more influence on her work than females, stating: "Every female you see at a piano is either Lynsey de Paul, or Carole King. And most male music—not all of it but the good stuff—really lays it on you. It really puts you against the wall and that's what I like to do. I'd like my music to intrude. Not many females succeed with that."
The experimental nature of her music has led it to be described as a later, more technological, and more accessible manifestation of the British progressive rock movement. Southern England was the home to the most influential and successful acts of the progressive rock movement and, like other artists in this genre, Bush rejects the classic American style of making pop music, which was adopted by most UK pop artists. Bush's vocals contain elements of British, Anglo-Irish and most prominently (southern) English accents and, in its utilisation of musical instruments from many periods and cultures, her music has differed from American pop norms. Elements of Bush's lyrics tend to be more unusual and less clichéd than American-style pop lyrics, often employing historical or literary references and avoiding autobiographical lyrics. She considers herself a storyteller who embodies the character singing the song and strenuously rejects efforts by others to insist that her songs are autobiographical.[tpl]cite web|last =Moy|first =Ron| title = Kate Bush and mythologies of Englishness|publisher=Popular Musicology Online| url = http://www.popular-musicology-online.com/issues/02/moy-01.html| year =2006| accessdate =6 April 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13281337 |title=BBC News - Kate Bush admits frustration over time between albums |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-05-04 |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01131qg |title=BBC Radio 2 - Mark Radcliffe's Music Club, 17/05/2011 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl]
Reviewers have used the term "surreal" to describe her music.[tpl]cite journal |title=The Unique Poetry Of Kate Bush |work=Hi-Fi & Record Review |first=Sue|last= Hudson |date= December 1985[/tpl] Many of her songs have a melodramatic emotional and musical surrealism that defies easy categorisation.[tpl]cite news|last = Hudson| first =Sue| title = The Back Page|work=Hi-Fi and Record Review[/tpl] It has been observed that even the more joyous pieces are often tinged with traces of melancholy, and even the most sorrowful pieces have elements of vitality struggling against all that would oppress them.[tpl]cite news|last = Davis| first =Erik| title = Red Shoes review|work=Spin |year=1993 [/tpl]
Her lyrics have referenced a wide array of subject matter, often relatively obscure, as in G. I. Gurdjieff in the song "Them Heavy People", while "Deeper Understanding", from The Sensual World, portrays a person who stays indoors, obsessively talking to a computer and shunning human contact. "Cloudbusting" was inspired by Peter Reich's autobiography, "Book of Dreams", about his relationship with his father, Wilhelm Reich. In a retrospective review of "Cloudbusting", Allmusic journalist Amy Hanson praised the song for "the rich earth of imagery that Bush has tilled throughout her entire career, emerging both tender and brutal." Commending the song for having "a thoughtful lyric and a compulsive cello-driven melody", Hanson wrote: "Even more startling, but hardly surprising, is the ease with which Bush was able to capture the moment when a child first realizes that adults are fallible and the parental cocoon is tenuous at best."[tpl]cite web|last=Hanson |first=Amy |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/cloudbusting-mt0003655152 |title=Cloudbusting - Kate Bush : Listen, Appearances, Song Review |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=9 November 2012[/tpl]
Comedy is also a big influence on her and is a significant component of her work. She has cited Woody Allen,[tpl]cite news |last=Brown |first=Len |title=In the Realm of the Senses |work=New Musical Express  |date=7 October 1989[/tpl] Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, and The Young Ones as particular favourites. Horror movies are another interest of Bush's and have influenced the gothic nature of several of her songs, such as "Hounds of Love", inspired by the 1957 horror movie Night of the Demon.[tpl]cite news |last=Sutcliffe |first=Phil |title=Hounds of Love Sleeve Notes |work=Q magazine |date=June 1991[/tpl] Her songs have occasionally combined comedy and horror to form dark humour, such as murder by poisoning in "Coffee Homeground", an alcoholic mother in "Ran Tan Waltz" and the upbeat "The Wedding List", a song inspired by François Truffaut's 1967 film of Cornell Woolrich's The Bride Wore Black about the death of a groom and the bride's subsequent revenge against the killer.[tpl]cite journal |author=Irwin, Colin |title=Paranoia and Passion of the Kate Inside |work=Melody Maker |date= 10 October 1980[/tpl]

==Length of time between albums and perception of perfectionism==

The length of time between album releases has led to rumours in the media concerning her health or appearance.[tpl]cite news |title = Little Miss Can't Be Wrong |work=Q magazine |date=December 1993[/tpl] In the past, stories of weight gain or mental instability have been disproved by Bush's periodic reappearance.[tpl]cite news|last=Ziegler|first=Mollie|title=The Return of a Sultry Songstress |work=The New York Sun|date=8 November 2005 [/tpl] In 2011 Bush told BBC Radio 4 that the amount of time between album releases is extremely stressful noting: "It's very frustrating the albums take as long as they do ... I wish there weren't such big gaps between them." In the same interview Bush denied she was a perfectionist in the studio, saying: "I think it's important that things are flawed ... That's what makes a piece of art interesting sometimes – the bit that's wrong or the mistake you've made that's led onto an idea you wouldn't have had otherwise," and reiterated her prioritisation of her family life.

==Live performances==

Bush's only tour took place 2 April – 13 May 1979, after which she has given only the occasional live performance. Several reasons have been suggested as to why she abandoned touring, among them her reputed need to be in total control of the final product, which is incompatible with live stage performance, a rumour of a crippling fear of flying,[tpl]cite news |last = Littlejohn|first = Maureen |title = The Sensual Woman |work=Network |date=March 1990[/tpl] and the suggestion that the death of 21-year-old Bill Duffield severely affected her.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26680147 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=22 March 2014 |title=Why did Kate Bush never tour after 1979? |date=21 March 2014[/tpl] Duffield, her lighting engineer, was killed in an accident during her 2 April 1979 concert at Poole Arts Centre. Bush held a benefit concert on 12 May 1979, with Peter Gabriel and Steve Harley at London's Hammersmith Odeon for his family. Duffield would be honoured in two later songs: "Blow Away" on Never for Ever and "Moments of Pleasure" on The Red Shoes. Bush explained in a BBC Radio 2 interview with Mark Radcliffe that she actually enjoyed the tour but was consumed with producing her subsequent records. A BBC film crew followed the preparation for the tour which was shown on the BBC Nationwide program as a 30-minute special.
During the same period as her tour, she made numerous television appearances around the world, including Top of the Pops in the United Kingdom, Bios Bahnhof in Germany, and Saturday Night Live in the United States (with Paul Shaffer on piano).[tpl]cite news|last=Gambaccini|first=Paul|title=Kate Bush Smiles in Her New Red Shoes|work=New York Press|date=24 November 1993[/tpl] On 28 December 1979, BBC TV aired the Kate Bush Christmas Special.

After the Tour of Life, Bush desired to make two more albums before touring again. At that point, she got involved with production techniques and sound experimentation that took up a lot of time and prevented her from touring. She came close to touring again following the release of The Dreaming and The Red Shoes, but live shows never materialized."Kate Bush – The reclusive first lady of art rock: when she's not admiring John Lydon, she's pestering the Queen", Classic Rock, Issue 160
In 1982, Bush participated in the first benefit concert in aid of The Prince's Trust alongside artists such as Madness, Midge Ure, Phil Collins, Mick Karn and Pete Townshend. On 25 April 1986 Bush performed live for British charity event Comic Relief, singing "Do Bears... ?", a humorous duet with Rowan Atkinson, and a rendition of "Breathing". On 28 June 1987, she made a guest appearance to duet with Peter Gabriel on "Don't Give Up" at Earl's Court, London as part of his "So" tour. In March 1987, Bush sang "Running Up that Hill" at The Secret Policeman's Third Ball accompanied by David Gilmour.
On 17 January 2002, Bush appeared with her long-time champion, David Gilmour, singing the part of the doctor in "Comfortably Numb" at the Royal Festival Hall in London.
In 2011 Bush told the magazine Classic Rock: "I do hope that some time I get a chance to do some shows. Maybe not a tour, but something" 
In March 2014 Bush announced a 22-night residency called "Before the Dawn" in London from 26 August – 1 October 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo, her first live shows in 35 years. The tickets sold out in 15 minutes.[tpl]cite web|author=Guardian music |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/21/kate-bush-announces-first-series-of-shows-since-1979 |title=Kate Bush announces first live shows since 1979 | Music |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2586053/Kate-Bush-announces-new-London-tour-35-years-retirement.html|title= Kate Bush announces new London residency... 35 years after her retirement from touring|date=21 March 2014|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=21 March 2014|first1=Alison|last1=Boshoff|first2=Sarah|last2=Bull[/tpl]

==Video projects==

In 1979 Bush's one live show, The Tour of Life, was recorded for the BBC and for release on VHS as Kate Bush Live at Hammersmith Odeon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kate-bush-p3805/discography/dvds-videos |title=Kate Bush DVDs & Videos |publisher=allmusic.com |accessdate=10 May 2011[/tpl]
Bush has appeared in innovative music videos designed to accompany her singles releases. Among the best known are those for "Running Up that Hill", "Babooshka", "Breathing", "Wuthering Heights", and "The Man with the Child in His Eyes", and "Cloudbusting", featuring actor Donald Sutherland, who made time during the filming of another project to take part in the video.[tpl]cite news| title = Kate Bush radio interview|publisher=CBAK 4011 (Australia)|year=1985[/tpl] EMI has released collections of her videos, including The Single File, Hair of the Hound, The Whole Story, a career video overview released in conjunction with the 1986 compilation album of the same title, and The Sensual World.
In 1993, she directed and starred in the short film, The Line, the Cross & the Curve, a musical co-starring Miranda Richardson, featuring music from Bush's album The Red Shoes, which was inspired by the classic movie of the same name. It was released on VHS in the UK in 1994 and also received a small number of cinema screenings around the world. In recent interviews, Bush has said that she considers it a failure, and stated in 2001: "I'm very pleased with four minutes of it, but I'm very disappointed with the rest."[tpl]cite journal |author=Aizlewood, John |title = The Big Sleep |work=Q magazine |date = December 2001 [/tpl] In a 2005 interview, she described the film as "A load of bollocks."Mojo Magazine, page 81, October 2005 edition
In 1994, Bush provided the music used in a series of psychedelic-themed television adverts for the soft drink Fruitopia that appeared in the United States. The same company aired the adverts in the United Kingdom, but the British version featured singer Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins instead of Bush.[tpl]cite web| title = Cocteau Twins Discography|publisher=CocteauTwins.org| url = http://www.cocteautwins.org/~leesa/cocteautwins/cHTML/html/soundtracks.html |accessdate=4 April 2007 [/tpl]
In late 2006, a DVD documentary titled Kate Bush Under Review was released by Sexy Intellectual, which included archival interviews with Bush, along with interviews with a selection of music historians and journalists (including Phil Sutcliffe, Nigel Williamson, and Morris Pert).

Bush has released four short videos for the album 50 Words for Snow. One is an advertisement for the album. Two stop-motion "Animation Segments" were posted on the Kate Bush Official website and YouTube, one to accompany a 2-minute 25 second section of "Misty", called "Mistraldespair", the other to accompany a 2-minute 33 second section of "Wild Man". "Mistraldespair" was directed by Bush and animated by Gary Pureton,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.katebush.com/news/mistraldespair-animation |title=Mistraldespair - Animation |publisher=Kate Bush |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl] while the "Wild Man" segment was created by Finn and Patrick at Brandt Animation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.katebush.com/news/wild-man-animation |title=Wild Man - Animation |publisher=Kate Bush |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl] On 24 January 2012, a third piece called "Eider Falls at Lake Tahoe", was premiered on her website and on YouTube.

==Film projects==

In 1990, Bush starred in the black comedy film Les Dogs, produced by The Comic Strip for BBC television. Aired on 8 March 1990, Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic version of Britain. While Bush's is a silent presence in a wedding dress throughout most of the film, she does have several lines of dialogue with Peter Richardson in two dream sequences. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced the theme song "Ken", which includes a vocal performance by Bush. The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council, who would later be elected as mayor of London and at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/04999-ken-livingstone-interview-music-politics |title=Features | Ten Songs | Ken Livingstone Interviewed: Boris, The Other Boris, Music, Politics & London |publisher=The Quietus |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl]
She also produced all the incidental music, which is synthesiser based. Bush wrote and performed the song "The Magician", in a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/music/kate-bush-faq/ |title=FAQ: rec.music.gaffa – Love-Hounds – Kate Bush |publisher=Faqs.org |accessdate=29 May 2010[/tpl] In 1985, Bush contributed a darkly melancholic version of the Ary Barroso song "Brazil" to the soundtrack of the Terry Gilliam film Brazil. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded "Be Kind to My Mistakes" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway. An edited version of this track was used as the B-side to her 1989 single "This Woman's Work". In 1988, the song "This Woman's Work" was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World.[tpl]cite web|last=Holmes |first=Linda |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2009/08/five_great_john_hughes_moments.html |title=Five Great John Hughes Moments National Public Radio (United States) 6 August 2009 |publisher=Npr.org |date=6 August 2009 |accessdate=29 May 2010[/tpl] The song has since appeared on numerous television shows, and in 2005 reached number eight on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=16666&sectioncode=1 |title=Eighties Kate Bush track goes Top 10 on download chart|publisher=Music Week|date=24 November 2005 |accessdate=21 November 2010[/tpl]
In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the Disney film Dinosaur, but the track was ultimately not included on the soundtrack. According to the winter 1999 issue of HomeGround, a Bush fanzine, it was scrapped when Disney asked her to rewrite the song and she refused. Also in 1999, Bush's song "The Sensual World" was featured prominently in Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan's film "Felicia's Journey".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165773/soundtrack|title= "Soundtracks for Felicia's Journey"|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl] "The Man with the Child in His Eyes" is on the soundtrack for the 2007 British romantic comedy film Starter for 10.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7318125/a/Starter+For+Ten.htm |title=Starter For Ten Soundtrack CD |publisher=CD Universe |date=13 February 2007 |accessdate=29 May 2010[/tpl]
In 2007, Bush was asked to write a song for The Golden Compass soundtrack which made reference to the lead character, Lyra Belacqua. The song, "Lyra", was used in the closing credits of the film, reached number 187 in the UK Singles Chart[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_B.HTM |title=Chart Log UK: Darren B - David Byrne |publisher=Zobbel.de |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl] and was nominated for the International Press Academy's Satellite Award for original song in a motion picture.[tpl]cite web | title = Tis the Awards Season: Lots of Green & "Golden" Loving Stars| publisher =Hollywood Today | url = http://www.hollywoodtoday.net/?p=3036| date =30 November 2007 |author=Silberman, Stacey | accessdate =15 May 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385752/awards|title= Awards for The Golden Compass : Satellite Awards|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl]
According to Del Palmer, Bush was asked to compose the song on very short notice and the whole project was completed in 10 days.[tpl]cite web | title = Lyra| publisher = DelPalmer.com| url =http://www.delpalmer.com/page14.htm | author = Palmer, Del| accessdate =15 May 2008 [/tpl] The song was produced and recorded by Bush in her own studio, and features the Magdalen College, Oxford choir.

==Collaborations==

Bush provided vocals on two of Peter Gabriel's albums, including the hits "Games Without Frontiers" and "Don't Give Up", as well as "No Self-Control". Gabriel appeared on Bush's 1979 television special, where they sang a duet of Roy Harper's "Another Day". She has sung on two Roy Harper tracks, "You", on his 1979 album, "The Unknown Soldier", and "Once", the title track of his 1990 album. She has also sung on the title song of the 1986 Big Country album The Seer, the Midge Ure song "Sister and Brother" from his 1988 album Answers to Nothing, Go West's 1987 single "The King Is Dead" and two songs with Prince – "Why Should I Love You?", from her 1993 album The Red Shoes, and in 1996, the song "My Computer" from Prince's album Emancipation. In 1987, she sang a verse on the charity single "Let It Be" by Ferry Aid. She sang a line on the charity single "Spirit of the Forest" by Spirit of the Forest in 1989.
1990 saw Kate producing, for the only time in her career, one song for another artist, Alan Stivell's "Kimiad", on his album Again. Stivell had appeared on The Sensual World. In 1991, Kate Bush was invited to perform a cover of Elton John 1972 song Rocket Man for the tribute album Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin. In 2011, Elton John collaborated with Bush once again in Snowed In A Wheeler Street for her most recent album 50 Words for Snow. In 1994, Bush covered George Gershwin's "The Man I Love" for the tribute album The Glory of Gershwin. In 1996, Bush contributed a version of "Mná na hÉireann" (Irish for "Women of Ireland") for the Anglo-Irish folk-rock compilation project Common Ground: The Voices of Modern Irish Music. Bush had to sing the song in Irish, which she learned to do phonetically.[tpl]cite news| title = Mna Na h-Éireann|work=Hot Press| date =29 May 1996 [/tpl]
Artists who have contributed to Bush's own albums include Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, David Gilmour, Nigel Kennedy, Gary Brooker, and Prince. Bush provided backing vocals for a song that was recorded during the 1990s titled Wouldn't Change a Thing by Lionel Azulay, the drummer with the original band that was later to become the KT Bush Band.  The song, which was engineered and produced by Del Palmer, is available for download and will be on Azulay's upcoming CD.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/lionelazulayLionel |title=Lionel Azulay MySpace Page |publisher=Myspace.com |accessdate=29 May 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.katebushnews.com/katenews.htm |title=Kate Bush News and Information 26 August 2008 |publisher=Katebushnews.com |accessdate=29 May 2010[/tpl]
Bush declined a request by Erasure to produce one of their albums because "she didn't feel that that was her area".[tpl]cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/01240-erasure-wanted-to-work-with-kate-bush |title=Erasure & Kate Bush: The Lost Collaboration The Quietus 4 March 2009 |publisher=Thequietus.com |accessdate=29 May 2010[/tpl]
In 2010, Bush provided vocals for Rolf Harris's cover of the traditional Irish song "She Moves Through the Fair".

==Influence==

From the 1980s onward, it has become almost standard for individualistic female singer-songwriters to be compared to Bush by the media. She has been noted as an influence on female artists such as Madonna,[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/livingicons/bio04.shtml |title=Living Icons - Kate Bush |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.channel4.com/news/wow-kate-bush-live-comeback-concerts-london-hammersmith-apollo-tickets|title= Wow!
