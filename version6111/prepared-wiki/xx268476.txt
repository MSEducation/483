==History==

Their self-titled debut album, Treefight for Sunlight, was released in the United Kingdom in February 2011, and received mixed reviews. Whilst general critical opinion was rarely against the album, concerns were raised that there wasn't enough power in it to ensure a successful career. Music blog DrownedinSound noted that while the album 'suggested potential' it was not well enough formed to earn a place in the UK music scene.
