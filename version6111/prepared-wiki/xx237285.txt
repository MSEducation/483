Wood Old Homestead, also known as Bob Evans Farm is the farm where Bob Evans and his wife Jewell lived for nearly 20 years, raising their six children.  The large brick farmhouse was a stagecoach stop, an inn, and now serves as a company museum.  It  features exhibits about Bob Evans Restaurants, the Homestead, and local history.  There is a reconstruction of the original steakhouse, company television commercials, and life-size dioramas and memorabilia of the Evans family.http://www.bobevans.com/ourfarms/bobevansfarm/homestead.aspx  Bob Evans Farm Homestead Museum
The farm also features the Adamsville Village, a 19th-century log cabin village, trails, and opportunities for camping, horseback riding, canoeing and special events.  The farm is still a working farm.  There is an annual Bob Evans Farm Festival. The original Bob Evans Restaurant on the farm is open year round.
