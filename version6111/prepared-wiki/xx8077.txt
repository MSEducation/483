[[Majority function]]

CATEGORIES: Logic gates, Circuit complexity, Boolean algebra

In Boolean logic, the majority function (also called the median operator)  is a function from n inputs to one output. The value of the operation is false when n/2 or more arguments are false, and true otherwise.
Alternatively, representing true values as 1 and false values as 0, we may use the formula
The "−1/2" in the formula serves to break ties in favor of zeros when n is even. If the term "−1/2" is omitted, the formula can be used for a function that breaks ties in favor of ones.

==Boolean circuits==

A majority gate is a logical gate used in circuit complexity and other applications of Boolean circuits.  A majority gate returns true if and only if more than 50% of its inputs are true.
For instance, in a full adder, the carry output is found by applying a majority function to the three inputs, although frequently this part of the adder is broken down into several simpler logical gates.
A major result in circuit complexity asserts that the majority function cannot be computed by AC0 circuits of subexponential size.

==Monotone formulae for majority==

For n = 1 the median operator is just the unary identity operation x.  For n = 3 the ternary median operator can be expressed using conjunction and disjunction as xy + yz + zx.  Remarkably this expression denotes the same operation independently of whether the symbol + is interpreted as inclusive or or exclusive or.
For an arbitrary n there exists a monotone formula for majority of size O(n5.3) [tpl]harv|Valiant|1984[/tpl]. This is proved using probabilistic method. Thus, this formula is non-constructive. However, one can obtain an explicit formula for majority of polynomial size using a sorting network of Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi.

==Properties==

Among the properties of the ternary median operator < x,y,z > are:
An abstract system satisfying these as axioms is a median algebra.
