CATEGORIES: Cat breeds, Cat breeds originating in the United States

The Ocicat is an all-domestic breed of cat which resembles a wild cat but has no wild DNA in its gene pool. The breed is unusual in that it is spotted like a wild cat but has the temperament of a domestic animal. It is named for its resemblance to the ocelot. The breed was established from Siamese and Abyssinian stock; later, American Shorthairs (silver tabbies) were added to the mix and gave the breed their silver color, bone structure and distinct markings.

==History==

The first breeder of Ocicats was Virginia Daly,http://www.ocicatinfo.com/daly.htm of Berkley, Michigan, who attempted to breed an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese in 1964. The first generation of kittens appeared Abyssinian, but the result in the second generation was not only the Abyssinian-pointed Siamese, but a spotted kitten, Tonga, nicknamed an 'ocicat' by the breeder's daughter. Tonga was neutered and sold as a pet, but further breedings of his parents produced more spotted kittens, and became the basis of a separate Ocicat breeding program.[tpl]Cite book|last=McKee |first=Bill |title=The Guide to Owning an Ocicat |publisher=TFH Publications |location=Neptune City, New Jersey |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-7938-2195-9 |oclc=47037281[/tpl] Other breeders joined in and used the same recipe, Siamese to Abyssinian, and offspring to Siamese. In addition, due to an error by CFA in recording the cross that produced the Ocicat, the American Shorthair was introduced to the Ocicat giving the breed larger boning and adding silver to the 6 colors. The Ocicat was initially accepted for registration in The Cat Fanciers' Association, Inc., and was moved into Championship for showing in 1987.[tpl]Cite book|first=Stephanie |last=Thompson |title=The Ocicat |publisher=Stephanie Thompson |location=Buenva Vista, CO |year=1999 |pages=14â€“15[/tpl] Other registries followed. Today the Ocicat is found all around the world, popular for its all-domestic temperament but wild appearance.

==Temperament==

Ocicats are said to be a very outgoing breed. Many owners say that their temperament is similar to a dogs.  Most can easily be trained to fetch, walk on a leash and harness, come when called, speak, sit, lie down on command and a large array of other dog-related tricks. Most are especially good at feline agility because they are very toy-driven. Some even take readily to the water. Ocicats are also very friendly and sociable. They are not often shy around strangers. This makes them great family pets, and most can also get along well with animals of other species,http://www.acfacat.com/ocicat_synopsis.htm although they are likely to assert their dominance over all involved [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]. Ocicats make excellent pets for people who want to spend a lot of time with their cat, but they do require more attention than cats who aren't so people-oriented.
