This page lists state and national mottos for the world's nations. The mottos for some states lacking general international recognition, extinct states, non sovereign nations and territories are  listed, but their names are not bolded.
A state motto is used to describe the intent or motivation of the state in a short phrase. For example, it can be included on a country's flag, coat of arms, or currency. Some countries choose not to have a national motto.
