Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew is a spinoff of Celebrity Rehab, in which celebrities who have substance addictions deal with their illness.  Unlike its predecessor, this show specifically addresses sexual addiction.  The participants live in a facility for 21 days with Dr. Drew Pinsky and Jill Vermeire providing daily one-on-one and group therapy sessions in order to address the psychological and psychiatric roots of their compulsive behavior.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.vh1.com/2009-10-06/sex-rehab-with-dr-drew-peep-the-full-cast/ |title=Sex Rehab With Dr. Drew - Peep The Full Cast |publisher=vh1.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-16[/tpl]

Patient Kari Ann Peniche's participation in the treatment program was marred by her aggressive and erratic behavior; verbally abusing the staff and other patients, refusing to participate in group discussions or obey rules, and voicing various bizarre or paranoid ideations, such as that people were laughing at her when they apparently were not, and smiling uncontrollably even when she was angry or discussing very sad topics. Dr. Pinsky became suspicious that she was using illicit substances, or had been prior to being admitted, and the staff psychiatrist diagnosed her as having Borderline Personality Disorder, both of which require treatment before any treatment can be done for sexual addiction.[tpl]Cite web | title = Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew | number =episode  102 | url = http://www.vh1.com/video/play.jhtml?id=1625684|publisher = VH1 | date = November 9, 2009 | accessdate = 11 December 2009[/tpl]  She was eventually discharged involuntarily for failing to obey the rules. Pinsky offered her an alternative program at a psychiatric hospital nearby, but she angrily refused.[tpl]Cite web|last=|first=|title=Full Episode Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew, Ep. 107|url=http://www.vh1.com/video/play.jhtml?id=1627940|publisher=|date=|accessdate=15 December 2009[/tpl]

==Criticism==

Drew Pinsky, producer John Irwin and Irwin Entertainment, which produce the show, have been criticized by addiction specialists in regard to Celebrity Rehab, from which Sex Rehab was spun off, for allegedly poor treatment techniques.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/magazine/03Pinsky-t.html?pagewanted=4|last= Norris|first= Chris|title = Hitting Bottom|work = The New York Times|date = December 30, 2009|page= 4 of 6[/tpl] With respect to Sex Rehab in particular, alumnus Duncan Roy has criticized the show's producers for prioritizing titilation and drama over rehabilitation for the patients in terms of casting, filming tactics and their editing choices, claiming that they instigated the behavior that resulted in Kari Ann Peniche's expulsion from the program in order to create a more watchable program. Roy has also questioned Pinsky's competence, saying that Jill Vermeire and Dr. John Sealy were his true source of therapeutic insight, and that while Pinsky is adept at treating drug and alcohol addiction, he is not knowledgeable in sex addiction, and merely repeated Vermeire's ideas. Roy further alleged that Sealy, whom Roy perceived as genuinely interested in helping sex addicts, confided in him that the producers had other motivations, and kept his involvement in the show minimal because he was not telegenic enough.
