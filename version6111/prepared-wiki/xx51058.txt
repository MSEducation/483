J. R. Hartley is the name of a fictional character in a popular British advertisement promoting the Yellow Pages which was first shown in 1983.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/nov/30/advertising.broadcasting|title=Veteran singer-actor who found fame in TV ad dies, 95 | work = The Guardian |accessdate=13 March 2013|location=London|first=Sarah|last=Hall|date=30 November 2001[/tpl]  
The advertisement shows an elderly man (actor Norman Lumsden) asking in several second-hand bookshops for  "Fly Fishing by J. R. Hartley". Every attempt fails, and the next scene shows him at home looking dejected. His daughter, sympathising, hands him the Yellow Pages (The UK's telephone directory for local businesses); in the next scene he looks delighted as his end of a telephone conversation reveals that a shop has a copy of the book. He asks them to keep it for him. He responds at dictation speed to a question: 'My name? Oh, yes, it's J. R. Hartley.' The advertisement ends by promoting the Yellow Pages, the voiceover provided by actor Joss Ackland. In Britain's 2000 "Greatest TV Ads" poll, the advertisement was voted in the top 15.[tpl]cite book |author=Owen, James |title=Trout |publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd |location=London |year=2012 |isbn=9781861898777 |page=125 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VHtZtD3RrdsC&pg=PA125&dq=J+R+Hartley&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eVZAUeDRHsXE4AOZkIHYAg&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=J%20R%20Hartley&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_ads/results.html | title=Channel 4 - 100 Greatest TV Ads | year=2000[/tpl] - 13th position [tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]
