Red Butte is a butte located in the Kaibab National Forest in Coconino County, Arizona. (On some maps, named Red Mountain, southeast side of U.S. Route 180, from Flagstaff to Valle.) It is known to the Havasupai nation as Wii'i Gdwiisa, "clenched fist mountain," and is regarded as a sacred site.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ratical.org/ratville/native/havasupi.txt |title=Religious Freedom The Environment And Uranium |accessdate=2014-02-08[/tpl]
Red Butte is the most notable feature on the Coconino Plateau between the San Francisco volcanic field and the Grand Canyon. Its base is formed of sandstones of the Moenkopi Formation. Above that are strata of the Shinarump Conglomerate; the summit is capped with volcanic rocks.
A trail leads to the summit along the west side.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/kaibab/specialplaces/recarea/?recid=11684&actid=119 |title=Red Butte Trail |publisher=Kaibab National Forest |accessdate=2014-02-08[/tpl] The summit affords a good view of the San Francisco Peaks, but because of the slope of the Coconino Plateau, only the uppermost part of the North Rim of the Grand Canyon can be seen.

==Lookout tower==

The Red Butte tower design is based on the USFS CL 100 plan with modifications. The 14' x 14' cab with tinted windows has a permanent roof overhang for shade. There is a metal catwalk and two cistern tanks for lookout staff water supply.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nhlr.org/lookouts/Lookout.aspx?id=408 |title=Red Butte Lookout  |publisher=National Historic Lookout Register |accessdate=2014-02-08[/tpl]
