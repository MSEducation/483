Sinkhorn's theorem is a mathematical theorem governing numerical computation.

==Theorem==

If A is an n × n matrix with strictly positive elements, then there exist diagonal matrices D1 and D2 with strictly positive diagonal elements such that D1AD2 is doubly stochastic.Marshall, A.W., & Olkin, I.
