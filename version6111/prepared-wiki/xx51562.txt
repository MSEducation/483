The New River Gorge Bridge is a steel arch bridge [tpl]convert|3030|ft|m|0[/tpl] long over the New River Gorge near Fayetteville, West Virginia, in the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. With an arch [tpl]convert|1700|ft|m|0[/tpl] long, the New River Gorge Bridge was for many years the world's longest steel single-span arch bridge;George R.

Part of U.S. Route 19, its construction marked the completion of Corridor L of the Appalachian Development Highway System.  The bridge is crossed by an average of 16,200 motor vehicles per day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wvdot.com/3_ROADWAYS/RP/TA%20Traffic%20files/GCnt/Fayette106.pdf|title=WVDOH: 2006 Fayette County Traffic Counts|year=2006|publisher=West Virginia Division of Highways|accessdate=2008-11-24[/tpl]

When it opened in 1977, the New River Gorge Bridge was the highest vehicular bridge in the world, a record it kept until the 2004 opening of the Millau Viaduct in France.  Several suspension bridges in China have since surpassed both of these bridges in height, with the current record holder being the Si Du River Bridge which opened in November 2009, with 1,549 feet (472 m) of clearance above the Si Du River.
In 2005, the structure gained nationwide attention when the US Mint issued the West Virginia state quarter with the bridge depicted on one side. In 2013, the bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

Construction began on the bridge in June 1974, and completed on October 22, 1977.  It was designed by the Michael Baker Company, under the direction of Chief Engineer Clarence V. Knudsen, and executed by U.S. Steel's American Bridge Division. Final cost of construction was $37 million (approximately $4 million over bid). It is made from COR-TEN steel. The use of COR-TEN in construction presented several challenges; notable among them was ensuring that the weld-points weathered at the same rate as the rest of the steel.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
Completion of the bridge cut the vehicle travel time from one side of the gorge to the other from about 45 minutes to 45 seconds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thebestofwv.com/WV/pictures/imageswv.htm|title=Images of West Virginia|work=The Best of West Virginia|publisher=The Gallery|accessdate=2009-11-11[/tpl]

==Tourism==

The New River Gorge Bridge is within the National Park Service's New River Gorge National River area, which protects this portion of the New River Gorge. At the northern end of the bridge, the Park Service operates a visitor center; it has scenic overlooks and a staircase that descends part of the way into the gorge.
A steel catwalk two feet (60 cm) wide runs the full length of the bridge underneath the roadway.  Originally built to facilitate inspections, the catwalk is open for guided, handicapped-accessible quarter-mile "Bridge Walk" tours; visitors use safety rigging.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bridgewalk.com/|title=Bridge Walk|accessdate=2009-11-11[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Green|first=Diana Kile|title=Bridge Walk Wows|journal=Wonderful West Virginia|date=October 2011|pages=8–9[/tpl]
Since its opening, the bridge has been the centerpiece of Fayette County's "Bridge Day",  held the third Saturday of every October. This festival includes demonstrations of rappelling, ascending, and BASE jumping."BASE" is an acronym that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: buildings, antennas, spans (bridges), and earth (cliffs).  Bungee jumping, however, has been banned during Bridge Day since 1993.
The bridge is closed to vehicular traffic during the festival. Prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks, two of the bridge's four lanes were open to traffic during the festivals. Since 2001, security concerns have caused the entire span to be closed to vehicles during these events.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
The first person to jump off the New River Gorge Bridge was Burton Ervin, who lives in Cowen, West Virginia, and was a coal-mine foreman. Burton jumped on August 1, 1979, using a conventional North American Aerodynamics Mini Rig System with a 32-foot Lopo canopy.  Four BASE jumpers have died at the bridge, three of these during Bridge Day festivals,Complete Bridge Day History, My West Virginia Home websiteBASE Jumping Fatality List[tpl]cite web | title=Californian Dies in Bridge Day Jump When Chute Fails to Open in Time | date=2006-10-22 | publisher=Huntington News | url=http://www.huntingtonnews.net/state/061022-seaton-day.html| accessdate=2010-11-12[/tpl] and one other killed while performing an illegal jump.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
