[tpl]Zoology[/tpl]Zoology [tpl]IPAc-en|z|oʊ|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i[/tpl], or animal biology, is the branch of biology that relates to the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct. The term is derived from Ancient Greek ζῷον, zōon, i.e. "animal" and λόγος, logos, i.e. "knowledge, study".[tpl]cite web|title=zoology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=zoology&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary[/tpl]

==History==

===Ancient history to Darwin===

The history of zoology traces the study of the animal kingdom from ancient to modern times. Although the concept of zoology as a single coherent field arose much later, the zoological sciences emerged from natural history reaching back to the works of Aristotle and Galen in the ancient Greco-Roman world. This ancient work was further developed in the Middle Ages by Muslim physicians and scholars such as Albertus Magnus.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mehmet Bayrakdar |year=1983 |title=Al-Jahiz and the rise of biological evolution |journal=The Islamic Quarterly |volume=21 |issue= |pages=149–55 |url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/37/772/9842.pdf |accessdate=21 December 2012 [/tpl][tpl]Cite book|title=Thinking about Life: The History and Philosophy of Biology and Other Sciences|author=Paul S.

Prominent in this movement were Vesalius and William Harvey, who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as Carl Linnaeus and Buffon who began to classify the diversity of life and the fossil record, as well as the development and behavior of organisms. Microscopy revealed the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for cell theory.[tpl]cite book |author=Lois N. Magner |coauthors= |title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |pages=133–144 |isbn=0-8247-0824-5 [/tpl]  The growing importance of natural theology, partly a response to the rise of mechanical philosophy, encouraged the growth of natural history (although it entrenched the argument from design).
Over the 18th and 19th centuries, zoology became an increasingly professional scientific discipline. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography, laying the foundations for biogeography, ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species. Cell theory provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life.[tpl]cite book |author=Jan Sapp |coauthors= |title=Genesis: The Evolution of Biology |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Chapter 7 |isbn=0-19-515619-6 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=William Coleman |coauthors= |title=Biology in the Nineteenth Century |year=1978 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Chapter 2 |isbn=0-521-29293-X [/tpl]

===Post-Darwin===

These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. In 1859, Darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by his discovery of a process by which organic evolution can occur, and provided observational evidence that it had done so.[tpl]cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |author=Jerry A. Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn=0-19-923084-6 |page=17[/tpl]
Darwin gave new direction to morphology and physiology, by uniting them in a common biological theory: the theory of organic evolution. The result was a reconstruction of the classification of animals upon a genealogical basis, fresh investigation of the development of animals, and early attempts to determine their genetic relationships. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation and the rise of the germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery. In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of Mendel's work led to the rapid development of genetics by Thomas Hunt Morgan and his students, and by the 1930s the combination of population genetics and natural selection in the "neo-Darwinian synthesis".[tpl]cite book |title= Science and Creationism: a view from the National Academy of Sciences |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&page=28 |format=php |accessdate= September 24, 2009 |edition=Second |year= 1999 |publisher=The National Academy of Sciences |location=Washington, DC |isbn=-0-309-06406-6 |page=28 |chapter=Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions |chapterurl=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&page=27#p200064869970027001 |ref=NAS [/tpl]

==Research==

===Structural===

Cell biology studies the structural and physiological properties of cells, including their behavior, interactions, and environment. This is done on both the microscopic and molecular levels, for single-celled organisms such as bacteria as well as the specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as humans.  Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.
Anatomy considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as organs and organ systems.[tpl]cite book |author=Henry Gray |coauthors= |title=Anatomy of the Human Body |year=1918 |publisher=Lea & Febiger |url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html |isbn= [/tpl]

===Physiological===

Physiology studies the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into plant physiology and animal physiology, but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular organism is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of yeast cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of human physiology to non-human species. Physiology studies how for example nervous, immune, endocrine, respiratory, and circulatory systems, function and interact.

===Evolutionary===

Evolutionary research is concerned with the origin and descent of species, as well as their change over time, and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines. For example, it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular organisms such as mammalogy, ornithology, or herpetology, but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution.
Evolutionary biology is partly based on paleontology, which uses the fossil record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution,[tpl]cite journal |author=Jablonski D |title=The future of the fossil record |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5423 |pages=2114–16 |year=1999 |pmid=10381868 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2114 |ref=harv [/tpl] and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics[tpl]cite book |author=John H. Gillespie |coauthors= |title=Population Genetics: A Concise Guide |year=1998 |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |isbn=0-8018-8008-4 [/tpl] and evolutionary theory. In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology.[tpl]cite book |author=Vassiliki Betty Smocovitis |coauthors= |title=Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology |year=1996 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03343-9 [/tpl] Related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy.

===Systematics===

Scientific classification in zoology, is a method by which zoologists group and categorize organisms by biological type, such as genus or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern biological classification has its root in the work of Carolus Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the Darwinian principle of common descent. Molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue to do so. Biological classification belongs to the science of zoological systematics.
Many scientists now consider the five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally start with the three-domain system: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); Bacteria (originally Eubacteria); Eukaryota (including protists, fungi, plants, and animals)[tpl]cite journal | author = Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | pmc = 54159 | ref = harv | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W[/tpl]  These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors.
Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:
Domain; Kingdom; Phylum; Class; Order; Family; Genus; Species. The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.[tpl]cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=hVUU7Gq8QskC&lpg=PA198&dq=species%20epithet%20capitalize&pg=PA198#v=onepage&q=species%20epithet%20capitalize | page = 198 | title = Writing for Science and Engineering: Papers, Presentation | author = Heather Silyn-Roberts | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-7506-4636-5 | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | location = Oxford[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/frameset/0065Ch7OaGoNSec1a60.htm#recF | title = Recommendation 60F | work = International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, Vienna Code | year = 2006 | pages = 60F.1[/tpl]
The dominant classification system is called the Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The classification, taxonomy, and nomenclature of zoological organisms is administered by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, and International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria for animals and bacteria, respectively. The classification of viruses, viroids, prions, and all other sub-viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the International Code of Virus classification and nomenclature.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp |title=Virus Taxonomy: 2011 Release (current) |date= |author= |publisher=, International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses |accessdate=21 December 2012 [/tpl] However, several other viral classification systems do exist.
A merging draft, BioCode, was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these areas, but has yet to be formally adopted.[tpl]cite conference | title=The BioCode: Integrated biological nomenclature for the 21st century? | booktitle=Proceedings of a Mini-Symposium on Biological Nomenclature in the 21st Century | author=John McNeill | date=4 November 1996[/tpl] The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed.  However, a 2004 paper concerning the cyanobacteria does advocate a future adoption of a BioCode and interim steps consisting of reducing the differences between the codes. The International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN) remains outside the BioCode.

===Ethology===

Ethology is the scientific and objective study of animal behavior.  The focus of ethology is on animal behavior under natural conditions,[tpl]cite web|title=Definition of ETHOLOGY|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethology|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=30 October 2012|quote=2 : the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour especially under natural conditions [/tpl]  as opposed to behaviourism, which focuses on behavioral response studies in a laboratory setting.  Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, influenced many future ethologists.[tpl]Cite journal | pmc = 1279921 | pmid = 12042386 |date=Jun 2002 | author = Black, J | title = Darwin in the world of emotions | volume = 95 | issue = 6 | pages = 311–3 | issn = 0141-0768 | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | url = http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12042386 | format = Free full text | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.95.6.311 | ref = harv [/tpl]
Biogeography studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the Earth,[tpl]cite journal |author=Wiley, R. H. |year=1981 |title=Social structure and individual ontogenies: problems of description, mechanism, and evolution |journal= Perspectives in ethology |volume=4 |issue= |pages=105–133 |url=http://www.unc.edu/home/rhwiley/pdfs/IndividualOntogenies.pdf |accessdate=21 December 2012 [/tpl] focusing on topics like plate tectonics, climate change, dispersal and migration, and cladistics.

==Branches of zoology==

Although the study of animal life is ancient, its scientific incarnation is relatively modern. This mirrors the transition from natural history to biology at the start of the nineteenth century. Since Hunter and Cuvier, comparative anatomical study has been associated with morphography shapins the modern areas of zoological investigation:  anatomy, physiology, histology, embryology, teratology and ethology. Modern zoology first arose in German and British universities. In Britain, Thomas Henry Huxley was a prominent figure. His ideas were centered on the morphology of animals. Many consider him the greatest comparative anatomist of the latter half of the nineteenth century. Similar to Hunter, his courses were composed of lectures and laboratory practical classes in contrast to the previous format of lectures only.
Gradually zoology expanded beyond Huxley's comparative anatomy to include the following sub-disciplines:
