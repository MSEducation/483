GJ 1061 is a small red dwarf approximately 12 light-years from Earth in the southern constellation of Horologium. Even though it is a relatively nearby it is very dim with a magnitude of about 13 so it can only be seen with at least a moderately-sized telescope.

==Significance==

The proper motion of GJ 1061 has been known for some time, but it was thought to be much further away. Its distance was only accurately determined in 1997 by the RECONS team. At that time it was the 20th nearest star system to the Sun. The discovery team noted that many more stars such as this are likely to be discovered nearby.

==Properties==

This star is a very small, dim, red dwarf, close to the lower mass limit for a star. It has an estimated mass of about 11.3% of the Sun and is only 0.1% as luminous.
