</ref>), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon, though rare, has proven to be much more successful as a life base than the much more abundant silicon, may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets. For example: silicon is less versatile than carbon in forming compounds; the compounds formed by silicon are unstable and it blocks the flow of heat.<ref name=BC>[tpl]cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet[/tpl]</ref> Even so, [[biogenic silica]] is used by some Earth life, such as the silicate skeletal structure of [[diatom]]s. This suggests that extraterrestrial life forms may have silicon-based structure molecules and carbon-based proteins for metabolic purposes, therefore enabling the ability to feed on a common resource on a terrestrial planet like Earth for building up the silicon-based part of their body.
Silicon compounds may possibly be biologically useful under temperatures or pressures different from the surface of a terrestrial planet, either in conjunction with or in a role less directly analogous to carbon.

In cinematic and literary science fiction, a moment when man-made machines cross from nonliving to living, it is often posited, this new form would be the first example of non-carbon-based life. Since the advent of the microprocessor in the late 1960s, these machines are often classed as computers (or computer-guided robots) and filed under "silicon-based life", even though the silicon backing matrix of these processors is not nearly as fundamental to their operation as carbon is for "wet life".

===Other exotic element-based biochemistries===

==Chlorine as an alternative to oxygen==

A number of alternatives to molecular oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor are known from anaerobic life forms on Earth. However, it has been proposed that chlorine might serve as a more general biological alternative to oxygen,[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] either in carbon-based biologies or hypothetical non-carbon-based ones. But chlorine is much less abundant than oxygen in the universe, and so planets with a sufficiently chlorine-rich atmosphere are likely to be rare, if they exist at all. Chlorine will, instead, likely be bound up as salts and other inert compounds.

==Arsenic as an alternative to phosphorus==

Arsenic, which is chemically similar to phosphorus, while poisonous for most life forms on Earth, is incorporated into the biochemistry of some organisms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://umbbd.ethz.ch/periodic/elements/as.html |title=Biochemical Periodic Table – Arsenic |publisher=UMBBD |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2010-05-29[/tpl] Some marine algae incorporate arsenic into complex organic molecules such as arsenosugars and arsenobetaines. Fungi and bacteria can produce volatile methylated arsenic compounds. Arsenate reduction and arsenite oxidation have been observed in microbes (Chrysiogenes arsenatis).[tpl]cite journal| journal= Appl Environ Microbiol|date=December 2001| volume=67| issue=12| pages=5568–80| title= Isolation and characterization of a novel As(V)-reducing bacterium: implications for arsenic mobilization and the genus Desulfitobacterium| last= Niggemyer| first= A| coauthors= Spring S, Stackebrandt E, Rosenzweig RF| doi=10.1128/AEM.67.12.5568-5580.2001| pmid= 11722908| pmc= 93345[/tpl] Additionally, some prokaryotes can use arsenate as a terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic growth and some can utilize arsenite as an electron donor to generate energy.
It has been speculated that the earliest life forms on Earth may have used arsenic in place of phosphorus in the structure of their DNA.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/mg19826533.600-early-life-could-have-relied-on-arsenic-dna.html| journal=New Scientist| title= Early life could have relied on 'arsenic DNA'| date= 26 April 2008| first= Michael| last= Reilly| issue= 2653| doi= 10.1016/S0262-4079(08)61007-6| volume= 198| page= 10[/tpl] A common objection to this scenario is that arsenate esters are so much less stable to hydrolysis than corresponding phosphate esters that arsenic would not be suitable for this function.[ref]

The authors of a 2010 geomicrobiology study, supported in part by NASA, have postulated that a bacterium, named GFAJ-1, collected in the sediments of Mono Lake in eastern California, can employ such 'arsenic DNA' when cultured without phosphorus.[tpl]cite web |title=NASA-Funded Research Discovers Life Built With Toxic Chemical |publisher=NASA.gov |date=2 December 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-02 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/astrobiology_toxic_chemical.html[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Wolfe-Simon |first=Felisa |last2=Blum |first2=Jodi Switzer |last3=Kulp |first3=Thomas R. |last4=Gordon |first4=Shelley E. |last5=Hoeft |last6=Pett-Ridge |first6=Jennifer |last7=Stolz |first7=John F. |last8=Webb |first8=Samuel M. |last9=Weber |first9=Peter K. |last13=Oremland |first13=Ronald S. |title=A Bacterium That Can Grow by Using Arsenic Instead of Phosphorus |journal=Science |date=2 December 2010 |doi=10.1126/science.1197258 |pmid=21127214 |url=http://www.ironlisa.com/WolfeSimon_etal_Science2010.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-09 |first5=S.

This claim was heavily criticized almost immediately after publication for the perceived lack of appropriate controls. Science writer Carl Zimmer contacted several scientists for an assessment: "I reached out to a dozen experts ... Almost unanimously, they think the NASA scientists have failed to make their case".
Other authors were unable to reproduce their results and showed that the NASA scientists had issues with phosphate contamination (3 μM), which could sustain extremophile lifeforms.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/news/Arsenic-Life-Claim-Refuted/biotechniques-332691.html#.UQBYhx3O3zk | title = "Arsenic Life" Claim Refuted | accessdate = 2013-01-23 | last = Williams | first = Sarah | date = 07/11/2012 | work = BioTechniques[/tpl]

==Non-water solvents==

In addition to carbon compounds, all currently known terrestrial life also requires water as a solvent. This has led to discussions about whether water is the only liquid capable of filling that role. The idea that an extraterrestrial life-form might be based on a solvent other than water has been taken seriously in recent scientific literature by the biochemist Steven Benner,[ref]

Carl Sagan once described himself as both a carbon chauvinist and a water chauvinist;
however on another occasion he said he was a carbon chauvinist but "not that much of a water chauvinist". He considered hydrocarbons, hydrofluoric acid, and ammonia  as possible alternatives to water.
Some of the properties of water that are important for life processes include a large temperature range over which it is liquid, a high heat capacity (useful for temperature regulation), a large heat of vaporization, and the ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds. Water is also amphoteric, meaning it can donate and accept an H+ ion, allowing it to act as an acid or a base. This property is crucial in many organic and biochemical reactions, where water serves as a solvent, a reactant, or a product. There are other chemicals with similar properties that have sometimes been proposed as alternatives. Additionally, water has the unusual property of being less dense as a solid (ice) than as a liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds), then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.
Not all properties of water are necessarily advantageous for life, however.Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 70 For instance, water ice has a high albedo, meaning that it reflects a significant quantity of light and heat from the Sun. During ice ages, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.
There are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be does the prospective solvent remain liquid, but at what pressure. For example, hydrogen cyanide has a narrow liquid phase temperature range at 1 atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of Venus, with [tpl]convert|92|bar|MPa[/tpl] of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.

===Ammonia===

The ammonia molecule (NH3), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen. The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea that goes back at least to 1954, when J.B.S. Haldane raised the topic at a symposium about life's origin.
Numerous chemical reactions are possible in an ammonia solution, and liquid ammonia has chemical similarities with water.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David[/tpl] Ammonia can dissolve most organic molecules at least as well as water does and, in addition, it is capable of dissolving many elemental metals. Haldane made the point that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogs; for instance the ammonia-related amine group (-NH2) is analogous to the water-related alcohol group (-OH).
Ammonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H+ ion. When ammonia accepts an H+, it forms the ammonium cation (NH4+), analogous to hydronium (H3O+). When it donates an H+ ion, it forms the amide anion (NH2−), analogous to the hydroxide anion (OH−). Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H+ ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger nucleophile. Ammonia added to water functions as Arrhenius base: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide. Conversely, using a solvent system definition of acidity and basicity, water added to liquid ammonia functions as an acid, because it increases the concentration of the cation ammonium. The carbonyl group (C=O), which is much used in terrestrial biochemistry, would not be stable in ammonia solution, but the analogous imine group (C=N) could be used instead.
However, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The hydrogen bonds between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's heat of vaporization to be half that of water, its surface tension to be a third, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a hydrophobic effect. Gerald Feinberg and Robert Shapiro have questioned whether ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together well enough to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system.[tpl]cite book| title=Life Beyond Earth| first=Gerald| last= Feinberg|coauthors=Robert Shapiro|publisher=Morrow| year=1980|isbn=0688036422 |id=ISBN 9780688036423[/tpl] cited in [tpl]cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html/ | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David[/tpl] Ammonia is also flammable in oxygen, and could not exist sustainably in an environment suitable for aerobic metabolism.[tpl]cite book| title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints| first=Dirk | last= Schulze-Makuch|first2=Louis Neal|last2=Irwin|publisher=Springer| edition=2| year=2008|isbn=9783540768166|page=119[/tpl]
A biosphere based on ammonia would likely exist at temperatures or air pressures that are extremely unusual in relation to life on Earth. Life on Earth usually exists within the melting point and boiling point of water at normal pressure, between 0 °C (273 K) and 100 °C (373 K); at normal pressure ammonia's melting and boiling points are between −78 °C (195 K) and −33 °C (240 K). Chemical reactions generally proceed more slowly at a lower temperature. Therefore, ammonia-based life, if it exists, might metabolize more slowly and evolve more slowly than life on Earth. On the other hand, lower temperatures could also enable living systems to use chemical species which at Earth temperatures would be too unstable to be useful.
Ammonia could be a liquid at Earth-like temperatures, but at much higher pressures; for example, at 60 atm, ammonia melts at −77 °C (196 K) and boils at 98 °C (371 K).
Ammonia and ammonia–water mixtures remain liquid at temperatures far below the freezing point of pure water, so such biochemistries might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based habitability zone. Such conditions could exist, for example, under the surface of Saturn's largest moon Titan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/research/planetary/undergraduate/dom/titan/titan.htm|title=Exobiological Implications of a Possible Ammonia-Water Ocean Inside Titan|last=Fortes|first=A.

===Methane and other hydrocarbons===

Methane (CH4) is a simple hydrocarbon: that is, a compound of two of the most common elements in the cosmos, hydrogen and carbon. It has a cosmic abundance comparable with ammonia. Hydrocarbons could act as a solvent over a wide range of temperatures, but would lack polarity. Isaac Asimov, the biochemist and science fiction writer, suggested in 1981 that poly-lipids could form a substitute for proteins in a non-polar solvent such as methane. Lakes composed of a mixture of hydrocarbons, including methane and ethane, have been detected on Titan by the Cassini spacecraft.
There is debate about the effectiveness of methane and other hydrocarbons as a medium for life compared to water or ammonia.Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 74. Water is a stronger solvent than the hydrocarbons, enabling easier transport of substances in a cell.[tpl]cite web|title= What is Consuming Hydrogen and Acetylene on Titan?|publisher=NASA/JPL|year=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-06|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-190[/tpl] However, water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the threat of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way. Also, the water molecule's tendency to form strong hydrogen bonds can interfere with internal hydrogen bonding in complex organic molecules. Life with a hydrocarbon solvent could make more use of hydrogen bonds within its biomolecules. Moreover, the strength of hydrogen bonds within biomolecules would be appropriate to a low-temperature biochemistry.
Astrobiologist Chris McKay has argued, on thermodynamic grounds, that if life does exist on Titan's surface, using hydrocarbons as a solvent, it is likely also to use the more complex hydrocarbons as an energy source by reacting them with hydrogen, reducing ethane and acetylene to methane.[tpl]cite journal| journal = Icarus|volume= 178| issue = 1|pages = 274–276|year= 2005|doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2005.05.018| title = Possibilities for methanogenic life in liquid methane on the surface of Titan|author = McKay, C. P.; Smith, H. D.|bibcode=2005Icar..178..274M[/tpl] Possible evidence for this form of life on Titan was identified in 2010 by Darrell Strobel of Johns Hopkins University; a greater abundance of molecular hydrogen in the upper atmospheric layers of Titan compared to the lower layers, arguing for a downward diffusion at a rate of roughly 1025 molecules per second and disappearance of hydrogen near Titan's surface. As Strobel noted, his findings were in line with the effects Chris McKay had predicted if methanogenic life-forms were present.[tpl]cite journal| title=Molecular hydrogen in Titan's atmosphere: Implications of the measured tropospheric and thermospheric mole fractions|author=Strobel, Darrell F.| journal=Icarus |volume=208| issue=2| pages=878–886| year=2010| doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.03.003| url=http://astrobiology.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Icarus-2010-Strobel.pdf |bibcode=2010Icar..208..878S[/tpl] The same year, another study showed low levels of acetylene on Titan's surface, which were interpreted by Chris McKay as consistent with the hypothesis of organisms reducing acetylene to methane. While restating the biological hypothesis, McKay cautioned that other explanations for the hydrogen and acetylene findings are to be considered more likely: the possibilities of yet unidentified physical or chemical processes (e.g. a non-living surface catalyst enabling acetylene to react with hydrogen), or flaws in the current models of material flow.[tpl]cite web|title= Have We Discovered Evidence For Life On Titan|author=Mckay, Chris|year=2010|url=http://www.ciclops.org/news/making_sense.php?id=6431&js=1| publisher=SpaceDaily| accessdate=2014-04-04[/tpl] He noted that even a non-biological catalyst effective at 95 K would in itself be a startling discovery.
(Although Mars is not known to have liquid methane, methane gas in its atmosphere is of astrobiological interest as a substance that might be produced by living organisms.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Oze |first1=Christopher |last2=Jones |first2=Camille |last3=Goldsmith |first3=Jonas I. |last4=Rosenbauer |first4=Robert J. |title=Differentiating biotic from abiotic methane genesis in hydrothermally active planetary surfaces |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/25/9750.abstract |date=June 7, 2012 |journal=PNAS |volume=109| issue = 25 |pages=9750–9754 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1205223109 |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.9750O |pmid=22679287 |pmc=3382529[/tpl] See Life on Mars.)

===Hydrogen fluoride===

Hydrogen fluoride (HF), like water, is a polar molecule, and due to its polarity it can dissolve many ionic compounds. Its melting point is −84 °C and its boiling point is 19.54 °C (at atmospheric pressure); the difference between the two is a little more than 100 K. HF also makes hydrogen bonds with its neighbor molecules, as do water and ammonia. It has been considered as a possible solvent for life by scientists such as Peter Sneath and Carl Sagan.
The biota in an HF ocean could use the fluorine as an electron acceptor to photosynthesize energy. HF is dangerous to the systems of molecules that Earth-life is made of, but certain other organic compounds, such as paraffin waxes, are stable with it. Like water and ammonia, liquid hydrogen fluoride supports an acid-base chemistry. Using a solvent system definition of acidity and basicity, nitric acid functions as a base when it is added to liquid HF.[tpl]cite book| title=Chemistry in Nonaqueous Ionizing solvents: Inorganic Chemistry in Liquid Hydrogen Cyanide and Liquid hydrogen Fluoride| first=Gerhart| last= Jander| first2=Hans| last2= Spandau| first3=C.C.|last3=Addison|publisher=Pergamon Press| location=N.Y.| year=1971|volume=II[/tpl] cited in [tpl]cite book| title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization| first=Robert A.| last= Freitas| publisher=Xenology Research Institute| location=Sacramento, CA| year=1979|chapter=8.2.2|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/8.2.2.htm[/tpl]
