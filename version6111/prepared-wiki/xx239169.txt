[[Miranda do Douro Municipality]]

CATEGORIES: Municipalities of Bragança

Miranda do Douro is a municipality covering an area of 487.17 km², with a population of approximately 7,707 inhabitants in the northeast corner of Portugal. Referred to as the "Cidade  Museu" of the Trás-os-Montes region, it is located 86 kilometres from the district capital, preserving many of its medieval and Renaissance-era traditions and architecture. Its seventeen civil parishes offer different facets of these traditions, that include a language of its own (Mirandese) which enjoys official status in Portugal, in addition to cultural and historical discontinuity with the rest of the Portuguese state.

==History==

Around 716 A.D., the Moors defeated local Visigothic tribes, and occupied some of the lands, calling the area Mir-Hândul.David J.J. Evans (2004), p. 132
By the late 11th century, Castile coveted the region as a stepping-stone to Portugal. The settlement of the village of Miranda developed through the initiative of King Denis, in an area that lay between the lateral slopes of the Douro and Fresno Rivers. It was in Miranda that the Treaty of Alcanices was signed between Denis and Ferdinand IV of Castile, setting the border between the two kingdoms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cm-mdouro.pt/historia/|title=O Concelho: Historia|editor=Câmara Municipal|location=Miranda do Douro, Portugal|publisher=Câmara Municipal de Miranda do Douro|language=Portuguese|accessdate=10 May 2011|year=2008[/tpl] Miranda was founded on 18 December 1286, and immediately elevated to the status of vila ([tpl]lang-en|town[/tpl]), with one of its prerequisites declaring that the administrative division would be a Crown fief. From that period forward, Miranda became progressively one of the most important towns that skirted the Trás-os-Montes region.
The Castilians finally occupied Miranda do Douro during the late 14th century, and would remain there until they were expelled by John I of Portugal.
On 10 July 1545, King John III elevated Miranda do Douro to the status of city, at the same time becoming the first diocese in Trás-os-Montes (in a papal bull on 22 May 1545 by Pope Paul III, which segmented a major part of the archdiocese of Braga. Miranda, therefore, became the capital of the Trás-os-Montes, seat of the bishopric (that included the residence of the bishop, canons and ecclesiastical authorities), military governorship and civil centre.
In 1762, during the Seven Years War, the army of Edward III invaded the Trás-os-Montes. During the course of his invasion, the gunpowder magazine (with over 500 barrels of powder) was hit by a cannon, destroying the four towers of the castle and many of the barrios in the vicinity. Approximately a third of the city's population (about 400 residents) were killed, resulting in the ruin of the religious, demographic and urbanized portion of Miranda. It was almost two years later (1764) that friar Aleixo Miranda Henriques (then the twenty-third bishop) would abandon Miranda, moving to Bragança, which had become a rival episcopal seat in the northeast part of Portugal. By 1680, it was the only ecclesiastical seat in the region.
The area was served by a narrow gauge railway, the Sabor line (Linha do Sabor), which ran over 100 km between Duas Igrejas-Miranda and the southern terminus at Pocinho, where connections could be made to the main line to Oporto. The Sabor line closed in 1988.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===

Miranda do Douro is located in a region that skirts the border between the Portuguese Trás-os-Montes region, and the Spanish autonomous community of Castile and León. The relief in this region is influenced by hard quartzite depoists near the border region, making erosion difficult, resulting in high escarpments and cliffs. The soils are composed of schists and granite bedrocks.

====Ecoregions/Protectet areas====

The Parque Natural do Douro Internacional ([tpl]lang-en|Douro International Nature Park[/tpl]), which encompasses the municipalities of Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo Municipality, Freixo de Espada à Cinta, Miranda do Douro and Mogadouro, includes an area of [tpl]convert|85150|ha|sqmi[/tpl], along the border portion of the Douro River. It was created on 11 May 1998 to encompass the constituent territories that encompass the Rivers  Douro and Águeda, along the Spain-Portugal border that include similar geological and climatic conditions, and to help support flora and fauna in the region, while allowing appropriate human activities. The creation of the complementary Parque Natural de Arribes in Spain, allowed the systematic protection of an area that encompassed the larger ecosystem and biome.
