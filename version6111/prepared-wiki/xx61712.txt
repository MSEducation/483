Jacques Santer (born 18 May 1937 in Wasserbillig) is a Luxembourg politician.
He was finance minister of Luxembourg from 1979 until 1989, and the 22nd Prime Minister of Luxembourg from 1984 to 1995, as a member of the Christian Social People's Party, which has been the leading party in the Luxembourg government since 1979. As Prime Minister of Luxembourg he also led the negotiations on the Single European Act, which effectively set aside the 20-year-old Luxembourg Compromise.

===Revelation of a stay-behind network in Luxemburg===

On November 10, 1990 an article appeared in the newspaper vum Lëtzebuerger Vollek, which translates into "Five years of state secret - The bombing NATO terror commando" that caused a parliament inquiry in which Santer was forced to reveal the existence of a stay-behind army in Luxembourg and being politically responsible to call for its dissolution.http://www.revue.lu/dossier-bommeleeer/verbrechen-im-namen-des-staates The organisation was active since its creation by the then prime minister Pierre Werner in 1959 and was organised by the secret service of Luxembourg, the Service de Renseignement de l'Etat (SREL) and coordinated by the NATO.http://revue.lu/aktuelles/verbrechen-im-namen-des-staates/?p=1&mid=21401, retrieved 9 May 2013 (German) On December 17, 1990 he told the constitutional committee the organisation had never more than 12 members and was only foreseen to handle intelligence operations, as well as escape and evasion manoeuvers. There were weapons cashes established in 1973, but direct access would not have been granted, according to Santer.  On October 14, 1990 the remaining members of the organisation were informed and requested to return their radio communication equipment.http://www.wort.lu/de/view/luxemburgs-schattenkaempfer-4f6f2707e4b02e2664d0f215

===Presidency of the European Commission===

Santer became the ninth President of the European Commission in 1995 as a compromise choice between the United Kingdom and a Franco-German alliance, after the Franco-German nominee Jean-Luc Dehaene was vetoed by British prime minister John Major.[tpl]Citation | title = Europe's presidential race: the form | url = http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TPQSST&source=login_payBarrier | journal=The Economist | date = 11 June 1998 | accessdate =16 September 2009 [/tpl] Santer selection was barely ratified by a European Parliament upset with the process for which Commission presidents are selected.[tpl]Citation  | title = The European Union: Politics and Policies  | year = 2004  | author=McCormick, John [/tpl]
In the same year, 1995, Santer became the first recipient of the Vision for Europe Award.
Allegations of corruption concerning individual EU-commissioners led to an investigation into administrative failings (incompetence and malpractice) by an independent group of experts. Despite clearing most commissioners, the report stated that they had not found a single person showing the slightest sense of responsibility. Because the implicated commissioners refused to resign and because the President of the European Commission did not have the power to dismiss individual commissioners, Santer and his entire commission resigned on 15 March 1999, the very day of the report's publication (see Santer Commission: Resignation).

===2000 to now===

From 1999 until 2004, Santer was a member of the European Parliament. He also was on General Mediterranean Holdings' board, a financial holding owned by Anglo-Iraqi Nadhmi Auchi.
