Waubay Wetland Management District is located in the "Coteau des Prairies," or prairie hills region of South Dakota. It includes more than 300 waterfowl production areas (WPA) in six counties of northeastern South Dakota. The WPAs range from [tpl]convert|40|acre|ha[/tpl] to more than [tpl]convert|1600|acre|ha[/tpl] in size, comprising a total of [tpl]convert|40000|acre|km2[/tpl]. WPAs provide vital wildlife habitat in a landscape of cropland and pasture.
Access to all WPAs is limited to foot traffic only. Grass parking lots are available at many of the larger WPAs to provide off-road parking. There are no facilities or designated hiking trails. WPAs tend to be used very heavily during hunting seasons, but they also provide wonderful opportunities to explore the natural areas of South Dakota at other times of the year. 
Waubay Wetland Management District includes the very first waterfowl production area - McCarlson WPA, acquired in January 1959 from Arnold and Lydia McCarlson.
