==Introduction==

In medicine, cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) is an umbrella term that defines  disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby “acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other”. [tpl]cite journal|last=Ronco|first=C.|coauthors=McCullough, S.D.|title=Cardio-renal syndromes: Reports from the consensus conference of the acute dialysis quality initiative|journal=European Heart Journal|year=2010|volume=31|issue=6|page=703-711[/tpl] The heart and the kidneys are involved in maintaining hemodynamic stability and organ perfusion through an intricate network. These two organs communicate with one another through a variety of pathways in an interdependent relationship. In a 2004 report from National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, CRS was defined as a condition where treatment of congestive heart failure is limited by decline in kidney function. [tpl]cite web|last=Evans|first=Frank|title=Cardio-Renal Connections in Heart Failure and Cardiovascular Disease|url=http://nhlbi.nih.gov/meeting/workshops/cardiorenal-hf-hd.htm|publisher=NHLBI Working Group|accessdate=22 November 2013[/tpl] This definition has since been challenged repeatedly but there still remains little consensus over a universally accepted definition for CRS. At a consensus conference of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI), the CRS was sub-classified into 5 types primarily based upon the organ that initiated the insult as well as the acuity and chronicity of disease.

==Classification==

Ronco et al. first proposed a five-part classification system for CRS in 2008 which was also accepted at ADQI consensus conference in 2010.  [tpl]cite journal|last=Ronco|first=C.|coauthors=McCullough, S.D.|title=Cardio-renal syndromes: Reports from the consensus conference of the acute dialysis quality initiative|journal=European Heart Journal|year=2010|volume=31|issue=6|page=703-711[/tpl] These include:
The distinction between CRS type 2 and CRS type 4 is based on the assumption that, also in advanced and chronic disease, two different pathophysiological mechanisms can be distinguished, whereas both CKD and HF often develop due to a common pathophysiological background, most notably hypertension and diabetes. Furthermore, the feasibility of the distinction between CRS type 2 and 4 in terms of diagnosis can be questioned.
Others view the Cardiorenal Syndrome in a more holistic, integrative manner.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bongartz LG, Cramer MJ, Doevendans PA, Joles JA, Braam B. |title=The severe cardiorenal syndrome: 'Guyton revisited'. |journal=Eur. Heart J. |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=11–17 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15615794 |doi= 10.1093/eurheartj/ehi020 |url=http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/1/11.full[/tpl] They defined the Cardiorenal Syndrome as a pathophysiological condition in which combined cardiac and renal dysfunction amplifies progression of failure of the individual organ, by inducing similar pathophysiological mechanisms. Therefore, regardless of which organ fails first, the same neurohormonal systems are activated causing accelerated cardiovascular disease, and progression of damage and failure of both organs.

==Risk factors==

The following risk factors have been associated with increased incidence of CRS.[tpl]cite journal|last=Tang|first=W. H. W.|coauthors=W. Mullens|title=Cardiorenal syndrome in decompensated heart failure|journal=Heart|year=2010|volume=96|issue=4|pages=255-260[/tpl] 

==Epidemiology==

Renal failure is very common in patients suffering from congestive heart failure. It was shown that renal failure complicates one-third of all admissions for heart failure, which is the leading cause of hospitalization in the United States among adults over 65 years old. [tpl]cite journal|last=Viswanathan|first=Gautham|coauthors=Scott Gilbert|title=The Cardiorenal Syndrome: Making the Connection|journal=International Journal of Nephrology|year=2010|volume=2011[/tpl] These complications led to longer hospital stay, higher mortality, and greater chance for re-admission. Another study found that 39% of patients in NYHA class 4 and 31% of patients in NYHA class 3 had severely impaired renal function. [tpl]cite journal|last=McAlister|first=F. A.|coauthors=Ezekowitz, M|title=Renal insufficiency and heart failure: prognostic and therapeutic implications from a prospective cohort study|journal=Circulation|year=2004|volume=109|issue=8|pages=1004-1009[/tpl]  Similarly, renal failure can have deleterious effects on cardiovascular function. It was estimated that about 44% of deaths in patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRF) are due to cardiovascular disease.

==Pathophysiology==

The pathophysiology of CRS can be attributed to low cardiac output, elevation of both intra-abdominal and central venous pressures, and neurohormonal and inflammatory activation. It was previously believed that low cardiac output in heart failure patients result in decreased blood flow to the kidneys which can lead to progressive deterioration of renal function. As a result diuresis of these patients will result in hypovolemia and pre-renal azotemia. However, several studies did not find an association between kidney dysfunction and cardiac output or other hemodynamic parameters. [tpl]cite journal|last=Schetz|first=Miet|title=Cardiorenal syndrome|journal=Medicine reports|year=2009|volume=78|pages=1-5[/tpl]  In addition, CRS has been observed in patients with diastolic dysfunction who have normal left ventricular systolic function. [tpl]cite journal|last=Viswanathan|first=Gautham|coauthors=Scott Gilbert|title=The Cardiorenal Syndrome: Making the Connection|journal=International Journal of Nephrology|year=2010|volume=2011[/tpl] Therefore, there must be additional mechanisms involved in the progression of CRS. Elevated intra-abdominal pressures resulting from ascites and abdominal wall edema may be associated with worsening kidney functions in heart failure patients. Several studies have shown that as a result of this increased intra-abdominal pressure there is increased central venous pressure and renal venous congestion which can lead to worsening renal function. [tpl]cite journal|last=Viswanathan|first=Gautham|coauthors=Scott Gilbert|title=The Cardiorenal Syndrome: Making the Connection|journal=International Journal of Nephrology|year=2010|volume=2011[/tpl] In addition, many neurohormonal and inflammatory agents are implicated in the progression of CRS. These include increased formation of reactive oxygen species, endothelin, arginine vasopressin, and excessive sympathetic activity which can result in myocardial hypertrophy and necrosis.

==Diagnosis==

It is critical to diagnose CRS at an early stage in order to achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy. However, unlike cardiac markers such as troponin, creatine kinase, natriuretic peptides, the field of nephrology is lacking reliable markers for acute kidney injury. Recently, research has found several biomarkers that can be used for early detection of acute kidney injury before serious loss of organ function may occur. Several of these biomarkers include neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), N-acetyl-B-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), Cystatin C, and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) which have been shown to be involved in tubular damage. [tpl]cite journal|last=Viswanathan|first=Gautham|coauthors=Scott Gilbert|title=The Cardiorenal Syndrome: Making the Connection|journal=International Journal of Nephrology|year=2010|volume=2011[/tpl] Other biomarkers that have been shown to be useful include BNP, IL-18, and fatty acid binding protein (FABP). [tpl]cite journal|last=Viswanathan|first=Gautham|coauthors=Scott Gilbert|title=The Cardiorenal Syndrome: Making the Connection|journal=International Journal of Nephrology|year=2010|volume=2011[/tpl] However, there is great variability in the measurement of these biomarkers and their use in diagnosing CRS must be assessed.

==Management==

Medical management of patients with CRS is often challenging as focus on treatment of one organ may have worsening outcome on the other. It is known that many of the medications used to treat HF may worsen kidney function. In addition, many trials on HF excluded patients with advanced renal dysfunction. Therefore, our understanding of CRS management is still limited to this date.
