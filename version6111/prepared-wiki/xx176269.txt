"Waiting in Vain" is a song written by reggae musician Bob Marley and recorded by Bob Marley & The Wailers, for his 1977 album Exodus.  Released as a single, it hit number twenty-seven in the UK Singles Chart. 
The single was one of only a few of Marley's Island singles to feature a non-album B-Side, this being the song "Roots", an outtake from the Rastaman Vibration sessions. This later appeared on the compilation Rebel Music and on Exodus (Deluxe Edition). The 1981 reissue of Waiting In Vain featured a megamix called Marley Mix Up Medley instead.

"Waiting in Vain" was covered by Annie Lennox for her album Medusa. It was released as the album's third single in 1995 and reached number thirty-one on the UK singles chart. Lennox's version was used in the 2001 film Serendipity and the 2002 film Changing Lanes.
