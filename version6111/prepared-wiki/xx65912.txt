[[Xin dynasty]]

CATEGORIES: States and territories established in 9, Imperial Chinese dynasties, 23 disestablishments, 1st century in China

The Xin dynasty ([tpl]zh|c=新朝|p=Xīn Cháo|w=Hsin Ch'ao[/tpl]) was a Chinese dynasty (although strictly speaking it had only one emperor) which lasted from AD 9 to 23. It interrupted the Han dynasty, dividing it in the periods of the Western Han and the Eastern Han.
The sole emperor of the Xin dynasty, Wang Mang (王莽), was the nephew of Grand Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun. After the death of her step-grandson Emperor Ai in 1 BC, Wang Mang rose to power. After several years of cultivating a personality cult, he finally proclaimed himself emperor in AD 9. However, while a creative scholar and politician, he was an incompetent ruler, and his capital Chang'an was besieged by peasant rebels in AD 23. He died in the siege, and the Han dynasty was restored by descendants of the former imperial clan.
