Thalion Software was a personal computer game company, during the time of the 16-bit home computers, like the Atari ST and Amiga.
The company was formed by members of the Atari ST demo scene  in October 1988, in Gütersloh, Germany. The main aim of Thalion Software was to produce cutting edge technology games. Despite the technical quality, sales of the games never really matched expectations and by the end of 1994 the developers had left and the company eventually closed. The two founders were Erik Simon (of The Exceptions) and Holger Flöttmann. Flottmann later went on to found another video games company, Ascaron.
