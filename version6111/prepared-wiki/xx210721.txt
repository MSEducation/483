==Competition==

Aliwan Fiesta is divided into three categories:  Cultural Street Dance Competition (the main event), Float Parade, and Reyna ng Aliwan (Queen of Entertainment/Amusement) beauty pageant.  Each of the country's 17 regions have the option to send up to two contingents representing its respective cultural festival, as well as an option to send a representing float and or beauty pageant contestant.[tpl]cite news| first=Maricar M| last=Calubiran| title=P2.5M at stake in Aliwan Fiesta| publisher=The News Today| date=April 20, 2007| url=http://www.thenewstoday.info/2007/04/20/p2.5m.at.stake.in.aliwan.fiesta.html| accessdate=2008-07-27[/tpl]  However, the roster of entries for the cultural dance and float competitions are limited.  In 2008, the number of slots for cultural dance was increased from 20 to 24 groups, which was completed as early as January.  Each contingent in the cultural street dance competition—totaling up to 100 dancers as well as hundreds of musicians and support staff members—have undergone stringent elimination cycles during various local festivals before being chosen to compete in Aliwan Fiesta.  The highlight of the event is when all competing festivals show off their dance skills while parading for four kilometers (about 2½ miles) along Roxas Boulevard from Quirino Grandstand to Aliw Theater grounds located near CCP.  The festivals range from the well-known such as Sinulog of Cebu City, and Panagbenga of Baguio City, to the obscure but just-as-interesting feasts like Alikaraw of Hilongos, Leyte, Padang-Padang of Parang, Shariff Kabunsuan, and Pamitinan Festival of Rodriguez, Rizal.  Side events also include a bazaar featuring different regional products, a photography contest, an inter-scholastic dance competition (interpreting dance tunes played on MBC radio stations), Filipino street games, and a fireworks display.[tpl]cite news| title=Aliwan Fiesta: Festival of champions| date=April 4, 2008| publisher=Malaya| url=http://www.malaya.com.ph/apr04/ente1.htm| accessdate=2008-07-27[/tpl]
Meanwhile, the participating floats are only allowed to use local textiles, produce, flowers, and other products specific in their representing city in decorating the vehicles.  Each float, portraying local folklore and indigenous traditions, is topped by a participant of Reyna ng Aliwan serving as muse.[tpl]cite news| first=Lex| last=Artifex| title=Aliwan Fiesta: A celebration of diversity| publisher=The Daily Tribune| date=April 27, 2008| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080430220909/http://www.tribune.net.ph/life/20080427lif1.html| accessdate=2008-07-28[/tpl]  The beauty pageant contestants have competed a day before the parade.[tpl]cite news| title=Reyna ng Aliwan| publisher=Abante Tonite| date=April 13, 2008| url=http://www.abante-tonite.com/issue/apr1308/entertainment2.htm| accessdate=2008-07-28[/tpl]

==Coffee table book==

MBC presented a coffee table book in 2008 entitled Aliwan Fiesta: Celebrating Life In These 7,107 Islands.  It was documented by cultural affairs specialist Susan Isorena-Arcega, featuring various photographs taken during Aliwan Fiesta's first five years.
