[[Shock mount]]

CATEGORIES: Microphones

In a variety of applications, a shock mount is a mechanical fastener that connects two parts elastically.
The main part of the shock mount is the elastic frame on the exterior.
This helps reduce noise from the surrounding area, without affecting the sound of the microphone.
Shock mounts are commonly used on studio microphones to prevent unwanted noise.  The shock mount is used to partially isolate the mic from vibrations that might otherwise be transmitted through the mic stand, causing unwanted sounds to be added to the output signal.
In order to avoid microphonism, particularly in the input stages of high-gain amplifiers, design engineers used to shock-mount the tube-socket assemblies in these stages by means of small rubber grommets placed in the screw holes, leaving them in a "floating" situation.[tpl]cite book|author1=Granino Arthur Korn|author2=Theresa M.

==Compact disc players==

A different design is found in some compact disc players, in which soft bushings are all that mechanically hold the disk and reading assembly, thereby isolating it from outside vibrations and from other outside loads such as torsion.

==Use in furniture==

A similar idea, also known as a shock mount, is found in furniture design, introduced by Charles and Ray Eames. This provides some shock absorption and serves as a living hinge, allowing the seat back to pivot.
