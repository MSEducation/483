The Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova ([tpl]lang-ro|Declaraţia de independenţă a Republicii Moldova[/tpl]) was a document adopted by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova following the failure of the August coup attempt. 
The document claims "millennial history" and "uninterrupted statehood" within historic and ethnic borders and refers to the official language as "Romanian.".[tpl]ro icon[/tpl] Declaration of Independence of the Republic of MoldovaA Field Guide to the Main Languages of Europe - Spot that language and how to tell them apart, on the website of the European Commission This founding act of the Republic of Moldova from 1991 is celebrated on August 27, the National Day or Independence Day.

The Moldovan Declaration of Independence clearly and directly claims Moldovan sovereignty over the territory of Transnistria as it is "a component part of the historical and ethnic territory of our people". However the Moldovan Declaration of Independence is itself used as an argument against Moldovan sovereignty over Transnistria as it denounces the agreement of August 23, 1939, between the government of the USSR and the government of Germany "null and void" being the only formal union between the two territories.Tiraspol Times; Former ASSR Pridnestrovie reminds Moldova: "You yourself denounced our union"
