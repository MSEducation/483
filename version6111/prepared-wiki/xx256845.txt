CATEGORIES: United States national commissions, Pan Am Flight 103, Presidency of George H. W. Bush

Pan American Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, on December 21, 1988. 
243 passengers, 16 crew members, and 11 people on the ground were killed by the explosion. It was the second most disastrous passenger airline explosion up to that time”Explosions Aboard Aircraft—1949 through 1989” Report of the President’s Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism, pp. 160-166. 
By the next day, experts found enough evidence to declare the explosion to be deliberate sabotage.Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 . See also Steven emerson and Brian duffy, The Fall of Pan am 103: Inside the Lockerbie Investigation New York, NY: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1990. Within days intelligence sources reported an anonymous telephone call to the United States embassy in Helsinki, Finland, on December 5, 1988, warned of possible sabotage on the flight.Saundra Torry, “Legal Issues Complicated by Dec. 5 Phone Tip of Possible Attack on Plane” Washington Post (December 29, 1988), p.

Newly elected President George H. W. Bush met with victims’ families in April 1989. Relatives present asked for an independent investigation of airline security which, they claimed, should have prevented the disaster. Bush promised he would look into establishing just such a commission. Relatives also complained about the State Department’s poor consular services for assisting victims’ family members.  This news seemed to shock the President.Laura Parker, “U.S. Agency Orders Measures to Improve Airline Security—Bush Meets with Families of Bombing Victims” Washington Post (April 4, 1989), p. A1
U.S. government personnel were belatedly reported to be deeply involved in the investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was working closely with its European counterparts Laura Parker, “Aftermath of Flight 103 Probe…” Washington Post (July 9, 1989) The Department of Justice was conducting a criminal investigation, and the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) was investigating its internal securities procedures.Senator George Mitchell (D-Maine)Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774-Present http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000811. “Presidential Commission to Investigate Aviation Security and the Bombing of Pan Am Flight 103” Congressional Record (August 4, 1989), p S10143
U.S. Congressional response to the disaster came when Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) >Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774-Present http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=L000123
introduced Senate Resolution S. Res. 86, calling on the President to appoint a special commission “to investigate the events surrounding the destruction of Pan Am 103”Congressional Record pp. S10143-10144 (August 4, 1989) That same day, President Bush did so.
