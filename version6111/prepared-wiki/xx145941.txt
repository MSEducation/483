Woodsdale is a ghost town in Stevens County, Kansas, United States.  It was involved in a county seat war with Hugoton.

==History==

Samuel Newitt Wood and I. C. Price developed the town and it was named for Col. Wood. Its post office was established November 11, 1886,[tpl]cite web | title = Post Offices in Stevens County Kansas, 1828-1961 | publisher = Kansas Historical Society | url = http://www.kshs.org/genealogists/places/postoffices.php?county=SV | accessdate = 2008-05-19[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and the town incorporated April 11. 1887. Following the bloody county seat contest in which the governor had to send in two National Guard companies, and which Woodsdale lost to Hugoton, Woodsdale declined. The post office closed March 31, 1915, and there are now no traces of the town remaining. It was located two miles east of Hugoton and six miles north at the intersections of sections 11, 12, 13, & 14.
