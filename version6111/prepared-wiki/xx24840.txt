In a July 1998 interview with George magazine, he stated:
[tpl]quote|Organized religions in general, in my opinion, are dying forms. ... They were all very important when we didn't know why the sun moved, why weather changed, why hurricanes occurred, or volcanoes happened. ... Modern religion is the end trail of modern mythology.

==Political views==

In 1988, he and then-wife Demi Moore openly campaigned for Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis's Presidential bid. Four years later, he supported President George H. W. Bush for reelection and he was an outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. However, in 1996, he declined to endorse Clinton's Republican opponent Bob Dole, because Dole had criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film Striptease.[tpl]cite news|last=Vincent|first=Mal|title=Playing the bad boy is a natural for Bruce Willis|publisher=HamptonRoads.com|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2006/03/playing-bad-boy-natural-bruce-willis|date=March 3, 2006|accessdate=May 10, 2009[/tpl] Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention,[tpl]cite news|title=Bush and Cheney head toward Philadelphia as party vanguard makes preparations |publisher=CNN |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/07/28/convention.wrap/index.html|date=July 28, 2000|accessdate=May 10, 2009[/tpl] and openly supported George W.

In February 2006, Willis appeared in Manhattan to talk about 16 Blocks with reporters. One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on the current government, but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence: "I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of... every year.

==Military interests==

Throughout his film career, Willis has depicted several military characters in films such as The Siege, Hart's War, Tears of the Sun, Grindhouse and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Growing up in a military family, Willis has publicly sold Girl Scout cookies for the United States armed forces. In 2002, Willis's second youngest daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase Girl Scout cookies to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS John F. Kennedy and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time.[tpl]cite news|last=Smith|first=Leah N.|title=Bruce Willis Moonlights as Off-Screen Hero with Cookie Donation|publisher=USS John F.

Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war:
 I went to Iraq because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, X number of people were killed today, which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these young men and women who are over there fighting to help this country.[tpl]cite web|title=Willis Fights for Iraqi Troops |publisher=Hollywood.com |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Bruce_Willis_Fights_for_Iraqi_Troops_/2436202 |date=March 9, 2005|accessdate=May 10, 2009|archiveurl=http://archive.is/Qcqf|archivedate=June 28, 2012[/tpl]

Willis described the plot of the film as "these guys who do what they are asked for very little money to defend and fight for what they consider to be freedom."[tpl]cite web|title=Willis to Make Movie Honoring U.S. Troops in Iraq |publisher=Hollywood.com |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Willis_to_Make_Movie_Honoring_US_Troops_in_Iraq/3469589 |date=November 28, 2005|accessdate=May 10, 2009|archiveurl=http://archive.is/ERCV|archivedate=June 28, 2012[/tpl]

==Controversy==

===Comments at playoffs===

Willis, an avid New Jersey Nets fan, made controversial comments on April 29, 2007 during a live broadcast of a Nets home playoff game on TSN by saying a catch phrase from his Die Hard films, "Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker", at the end of the interview. Reacting to the backlash, he later blamed his actions on jet lag, stating: "Sometimes I overestimate my ability to function under duress with less than enough sleep".

==="Walter_B"===

On May 5, 2007, someone using the screen name "Walter_B" started posting detailed responses onto Ain't it Cool News, where people were discussing the fact that Live Free or Die Hard received a PG-13 rating, instead of an R rating like the earlier three Die Hard films.[tpl]cite web|title=Bruce Willis|work=Ain't it Cool News|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/talkback_display/32511#comment_1493497|accessdate=May 10, 2009[/tpl] The responses included detailed information on Live Free or Die Hard, which was yet to be released; the theme of the Die Hard film series, direct criticisms of other film crews and casts, and many film trivia answers. Many people were skeptical that "Walter_B" was indeed Willis, but on May 9, Willis revealed his identity during a video chat session.[tpl]cite web|title=Is Bruce Willis a Talkbacker?|publisher=Freeze Dried Movies|url=http://www.freezedriedmovies.com/blog/index.php?/archives/81-Is-Bruce-Willis-a-talkbacker.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071103000430/http://www.freezedriedmovies.com/blog/index.php?/archives/81-Is-Bruce-Willis-a-talkbacker.html|archivedate=November 3, 2007|accessdate=May 10, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Shamoon|first=Evan|title=Bruce Willis Knows How to Use the Internet(s)|publisher=Switched.com|url=http://www.switched.com/2007/05/11/bruce-willis-knows-how-to-use-the-internet-s/|date=May 11, 2007|accessdate=May 10, 2009[/tpl]

In 1996, Roger Director, a writer and producer from Moonlighting, wrote a roman à clef on Willis titled A Place to Fall.[tpl]cite news |last=Gates |first=Anita |title=Moonlighting |work=The New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E5DC1439F937A15750C0A960958260 |date=March 24, 1996|accessdate=May 10, 2009[/tpl] Cybill Shepherd wrote in her 2000 autobiography, Cybill Disobedience, that Willis was angry at Director, because the character was written as a "neurotic, petulant actor."
In 1998, Willis participated in Apocalypse, a PlayStation video game. The game was originally announced to feature Willis as a sidekick, not as the main character. The company reworked the game using Willis's likeness and voice and changed the game to use him as the main character.
