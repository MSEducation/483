</ref> it merges into [[Penzance]] and the path now follows the promenade through the town, passing [[Penzance railway station]] and continuing past the [[Penzance TMD|railway engine shed]] along the shore of Mount's Bay with its views of [[St Michael's Mount]]. This is an island at high tide but can be reached from [[Marazion]] by a causeway at low tide.
The path now turns south again, passing the village of Perranuthnoe (or Perran) and Perran Sands, then skirting inland across the neck of Cudden Point to Prussia Cove and Bessy's Cove. A larger sandy beach is Praa Sands after which the path climbs up onto a series of cliff tops such as Trewavas Head. This area shows many signs of Cornwall's mining history with abandoned engine houses such as Wheal Prosper close to the path.
After passing through Porthleven the path crosses the shingle bank of Loe Bar with the freshwater Loe Pool behind. At Gunwalloe more cliffs appear, leading to Poldhu Cove overlooked by the radio station on Poldhu Point, then Porth Mellin on Mullion Cove with Mullion Island offshore. Rounding Predannack Head, Vellan Head, and Rill Head (where the Spanish Armada was first sighted on 29 July 1588),[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cornishman.com/penzance-to-lizard/porthleven_to_the_lizard.htm |title=Porthleven, Cornwall to the Lizard, Cornwall |accessdate=9 January 2008 |work=Cornwall Coastal Path [/tpl] the path leads to Kynance Cove and Lizard Point, the lighthouse of which has been visible for some distance. Lizard Point is the most southerly point of the British mainland.

===South Cornwall===

After passing The Lizard the path turns northwards, continuing past Housel Bay and a building used by Guglielmo Marconi for radio experiments,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lizardwireless.org/history.html |title=A brief history of the station |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=Lizard Wireless [/tpl] then Bass Point with its Coastguard Station. The Lizard lifeboat station is a sheltered position in Kilcobben Cove. Passing through Cadgwith and across Kennack Sands, the path heads towards Black Head then into Coverack. Once around Lowland Point, The Manacles lie a mile offshore, a reef that has wrecked many ships.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.st-keverne.com/Treleague/wrecks.html |title=A Diver's Guide to The Shipwrecks of The Lizard |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=St Keverne.com [/tpl] The path passes through Porthoustock and Porthallow, then around Nare Point lies Gillan Creek. This can be crossed at very low tide, but most walkers follow the lanes round the head of the creek to reach Dennis Head at the mouth of the Helford River. To cross this wider river means following it inland to Helford where there is a ferry across to Helford Passage on the north bank. Some people take a short cut from Gillan Creek to Helford by a path through Manaccan.
After following the river back through Durgan to the open waters beyond Toll Point, the path skirts Falmouth Bay along Maenporth, Swanpool and Gyllyngvase beaches before passing around the headland beneath Pendennis Castle to enter bustling Falmouth. The castle was built, along with its twin at St Mawes, to protect the deep water of Carrick Roads from attack. This natural haven is what made Falmouth such an important harbour, it being the last good shelter for ships heading westwards towards the Atlantic Ocean.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.falmouthport.co.uk/pdf/ports_handbook.pdf |title=Falmouth and Truro Ports Handbook |accessdate=25 November 2007 |format=PDF |work=Falmouth Port [/tpl]
The path crosses the harbour on the St Mawes Ferry and then passes St Anthony Head and Zone Point and northwards past the village of Portscatho and around Gerrans Bay. Beyond Nare Head is Portloe in Veryan Bay. The next big headland is Dodman Point after which the coast path resumes its northwards course through Gorran Haven and the fishing harbour at Mevagissey to Pentewan where the once busy dock has silted up with sand.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.historic-cornwall.org.uk/cisi/pentewan/CISI_pentewan_report%20.pdf | format=PDF | title=Cornwall Industrial Settlements Initiative PENTEWAN |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=Historic Cornwall[/tpl] The path then climbs up around Black Head to reach Portpean and then Charlestown. This was the first harbour to serve the china clay industry around St Austell and has featured in several films as it is home to a heritage fleet of sailing ships.[tpl]cite web | url=http://uk.imdb.com/List?endings=on&&locations=Charlestown,%20Cornwall,%20England,%20UK&&heading=18;with+locations+including;Charlestown,%20Cornwall,%20England,%20UK | author=IMDb | title=Titles with locations including Charlestown, Cornwall, England, UK | accessdate=26 November 2007[/tpl]
After passing Carlyon Bay the path comes to the much busier china-clay exporting port of Par, where it goes inland of the dock site. After passing through the village the path regains the coast at Par Sands and links with the Saints' Way, a coast-to-coast path across Cornwall, at Polmear. It then follows the cliff tops through Polkerris and around Gribbin Head. From here to Polperro is designated as a heritage coast.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.countryside.gov.uk/LAR/Landscape/DL/heritage_coasts/Cornwallhc.asp |title=Heritage Coast in Cornwall |accessdate=25 November 2007 |work=Natural England [/tpl]
The path now passes Polridmouth (pronounced 'Pridmouth') and Readymoney Cove to enter Fowey ('Foy'), another busy harbour but this time the deep water quays are situated up river above the town. The River Fowey is crossed on the Polruan ferry, beyond which are some steep cliffs with spectacular views. Beyond Lantic Bay lies Pencarrow Head then the larger Lantivet Bay with further cliffs and small coves leading to Polperro, a fishing village which bans cars during the summer.
Beyond Polperro lies Talland Bay and Portnadler Bay, with the bird reserve of Looe Island (also known as St George's island) off shore. The path now enters Looe, passing through Hannafore, West Looe then, after crossing the River Looe on a seven-span bridge. The path continues up onto the cliff then heads towards Millendreath then along more cliffs, running past a 60-ft sevenfold labyrinth carved into the turf of the hillside[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/things-to-see-and-do/view-page/item903855/|title=Millendreath and Bodigga Loop|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=26 January 2013[/tpl] to Seaton, Downderry, and Portwrinkle.
The long beach of Whitsand Bay has a fast-rising tide and is a military firing range so the path runs inland behind Tregantle Fort to reach Freathy and Rame Head. Beyond this lies Penlee Point and then the path turns northwards into Plymouth Sound, skirting Cawsand Bay and Mount Edgcumbe Country Park to reach the ferry at Cremyll. Beyond here lies the Hamoaze, the combined estuary of the Tamar and other rivers.

===South Devon===

The Cremyll Ferry lands in Devon at Stonehouse, one of the Three Towns that make up the modern city of Plymouth. The path follows roads past Stonehouse Barracks and Millbay Docks to Plymouth Hoe with its views across Plymouth Sound. It then crosses Sutton Harbour by the Mayflower Steps then skirts the hill of Cattedown to cross the River Plym by the Laira Bridge to Plymstock. Passing round the edge of the tidal Hooe Lake, the path regains the countryside above Jennycliff Bay, part of the Plymouth Sound, Shores and Cliffs (Site of Special Scientific Interest), and follows the cliffs past Bovisand to Wembury, Wembury Marine Centre.
From Wembury the path travels east into the South Hams district to the Warren Point Ferry, across the River Yealm, near Newton Ferrers. The River Erme near Kingston must be forded at Erme Mouth within one hour of low tide. The view to the southwest is then over Bigbury Bay past Burgh Island and Hope Cove to the promontory known as Bolt Tail. The next 6 miles (10 km) of cliff top paths from Bolberry Down past Bolt Head and the tidal ria of Kingsbridge Estuary to Prawle Point, belong to the National Trust. The estuary is crossed using the Salcombe Ferry, from Salcombe to East Portlemouth, close to Salcombe Castle and within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The path passes through the Prawle Point and Start Point Site of Special Scientific Interest which is recognised as being an important site for solitary bees and wasps, the rare cuckoo bee Nomada sexfasciata, and the Cirl bunting.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002757.pdf |title=Prawle Point and Start Point Site of Special Scientific Interest |accessdate=3 January 2008 |format=PDF |work=English Nature [/tpl]
The path then continues around Lannacombe Bay to Start Point and its Lighthouse and then through Start Bay along a 3-mile (5 km) shingle causeway between Slapton Sands and the Slapton Ley freshwater lake and nature reserve before entering the estuary of the River Dart and historic port of Dartmouth. From Dartmouth, the route uses either the Lower Ferry or Passenger Ferry to cross the river to Kingswear.
Kingswear is the terminus of the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway which follows the River Dart, but the coast path climbs out of the village in the opposite direction to reach Torbay, known as "The English Riviera".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.englishriviera.co.uk/ | title=The English Riviera | quote=The Official Tourist Board website covering the three towns of Torquay, Paignton and Brixham.| accessdate=26 November 2007 [/tpl] It passes the historic harbour of Brixham and the seaside towns of Goodrington, Paignton, Torquay, Babbacombe. The coast path then passes along wooded cliffs to reach Shaldon and the River Teign.
Crossing the river by ferry or the long Shaldon Bridge brings walkers to Teignmouth, beyond which the coast path follows the South Devon Railway sea wall to Hole Head where the Parson and Clerk rocks look out to sea. Passing beneath the railway, the path climbs up to the main road, which it follows for a few yards before turning back towards the cliff top (in stormy weather the sea wall is too dangerous and this road must be followed most of the way from Teignmouth). Entering Dawlish along a now by-passed toll road, the coast path descends back to the level of the railway which it follows to Dawlish Warren, although a slightly more landward route is necessary at high tides.
Dawlish Warren is a sand spit and nature reserve that lies at the mouth of the River Exe. The route now turns away from the coast and follows the Exe estuary past Cockwood to Starcross where the seasonal Exmouth to Starcross Ferry crosses to Exmouth. The Exe Valley Way continues beyond Starcross towards Exeter, but when the ferry is not running it is possible to catch a train from either Dawlish Warren or Starcross railway stations to Exmouth railway station.
On the eastern side of Exmouth, the coast path climbs up onto the High Land of Orcombe. This is the start of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site.[tpl]cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=1029 | author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre | title=Dorset and East Devon Coast | accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl] The next town is Budleigh Salterton, beyond which lies the River Otter. The path then skirts Chiselbury Bay and Ladram Bay towards Sidmouth which sits at the mouth of the River Sid. Access to the beach is via a wooden staircase known as Jacob's ladder. Sidmouth is surrounded by the East Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Erosion remains a serious concern east of the mouth of the River Sid.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/doc-tunnel-4.pdf?url=/dcc/committee/reports/ed0366hq.pdf |title=East Devon District: Proposed Rock Revetment Designed to Reduce Erosion of the Cliff Face at Pennington Point, Sidmouth |accessdate=26 November 2007 |format=PDF |work=Devon County Council Development Control Committee [/tpl] The cliffs have been heavily eroded, threatening cliff top homes and the footpath, which passes along the tops of the cliff, around Lyme Bay, avoiding The Undercliff towards Branscombe. The path then follows Seaton Bay past Beer, with Beer Caves a man-made cave complex, resulting from the quarrying of Beer stone and Seaton before going through The Undercliff SSSI and NNR[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/geological/sites/local_ID19.asp | title=Axmouth-Lyme Regis Undercliffs (SSSI and NNR) | author=Natural England | accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl] and crossing the border into Dorset shortly before reaching Lyme Regis.

===Dorset===

Across the Dorset border, the Coast Path runs through the town of Lyme Regis where the Cobb breakwater was seen in the film The French Lieutenant's Woman and features on the film's poster.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.lyme-regis-dorset.co.uk/library/the-french-lieutenants-woman.html| author=Welcome to Lyme Regis| title=The French Lieutenant's Woman | accessdate=9 January 2008[/tpl] Further east, where it shares its route with the Monarch's Way, the path passes by Golden Cap, the highest point on the south coast,[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-walk-golden_cap.pdf |format=PDF| author=National Trust | title=Coastal walk | accessdate=25 November 2007 | authorlink=National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty[/tpl] and on through Charmouth and West Bay (near Bridport), to Burton Bradstock at the start of Chesil Beach, an [tpl]convert|18|mi|km|0|adj=on[/tpl] long tombolo. At Abbotsbury, the path leaves Chesil beach to follow the shores of the Fleet lagoon, until it reaches the terminus of Chesil beach next to the villages of Fortuneswell and Chiswell on the Isle of Portland. The path circumnavigates the Isle of Portland, passing the lighthouses at Portland Bill and the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy in Chiswell, and returns across Chesil beach to Wyke Regis (encompassing the Rodwell Trail) and along the shores of Portland Harbour to the Nothe Fort in the resort of Weymouth.
In Weymouth the coast path runs along Weymouth Harbour and the Wey Estuary up to Radipole Lake, through the town centre to the Esplanade on the shore of Weymouth Bay, and on to Ringstead Bay, with White Nothe at its eastern end, near the village of Osmington Mills. There is an alternative route around Weymouth and Portland along the South Dorset Downs, which reduces the footpath distance by [tpl]convert|19.25|mi|km|0[/tpl]. Just the loop around the Isle of Portland can be omitted, reducing the journey by [tpl]convert|13.2|mi|km|1[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/main/walks_content/distancecalculator.cfm | author=SWCPA | title=Distance Calculator | accessdate=19 November 2007[/tpl]
The Coast path then follows the shores of the Isle of Purbeck – past Bat's Head and Swyre Head, and on to Durdle Door, a natural arch which has been described as "one of Dorset's most recognisable features".[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dorset/content/panoramas/durdle_360.shtml | author=BBC Dorset | title=Coast: Durdle Door | accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl] This lies just to the west of the Lulworth Cove, "the most visited geological locality in Britain".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/Lulworth.htm | last=West | first=Ian | title=Lulworth Cove, Dorset | accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl] Further east lies the ghost village of Tyneham, beside Worbarrow Bay, and Kimmeridge, next to Kimmeridge Bay, with its rocky shore and wave cut platform. Between Lulworth Cove and Kimmeridge the path passes through the Lulworth Ranges, which are not always open to the public.[tpl]cite web | author=Lulworth Estate | title=Army Ranges: opening times | url=http://www.lulworth.com/ranges.htm | accessdate=19 November 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/DefenceEstateandEnvironment/AccessRecreation/SouthWest/LulworthRanges.htm | title=MOD defence/about defence: Lulworth ranges | accessdate=19 December 2010[/tpl] When the ranges are in use a [tpl]convert|12|mi|km|0|adj=on[/tpl] road detour is needed.
The coast path then reaches St Alban's Head, just to the south of the village of Worth Matravers. Between St Alban's Head and the resort of Swanage is Durlston Country Park nature reserve. North of Swanage is the chalk Ballard Down, the eastern tip of which has been eroded to form Old Harry Rocks – a series of stacks, arches and caves jutting into the sea between Swanage Bay and Studland Bay. This headland marks the end of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. Behind Studland beach, an extensive system of sand dunes have formed a psammosere, stretching for miles across the Studland peninsula. The peninsula forms one shore of Poole Harbour, one of the largest natural harbours in the world. Part of Studland beach is the National Trust's only official naturist beach.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-studlandbeachandnaturereserve |author=National Trust | title= Studland Beach & Nature Reserve | accessdate=5 December 2007 | quote=The Trust's only designated naturist beach at Knoll Beach | authorlink= National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author=British Naturism | title=Studland Bay – official beach | url=http://www.british-naturism.org.uk/beaches/beaches_detail.asp?beach_ID=2 | accessdate=5 December 2007[/tpl] The South West Coast Path ends at South Haven Point, where there is a commemorative marker. The Sandbanks Ferry links this to the Sandbanks area of Poole on the eastern edge of the harbour.

==Intersecting and connecting paths==

From Plymouth to Poole the South West Coast Path forms part of the route of the E9 European Coastal Path which runs for 3,125 miles (5,000 km) from Cabo de São Vicente in Portugal to Narva-Jõesuu in Estonia. The route crosses by ferry from Roscoff to Plymouth, and beyond Poole the path follows the Bournemouth Coast Path to Milford on Sea, then the Solent Way (with an Isle of Wight option), South Downs Way, 1066 Country Walk and Saxon Shore Way to Dover, from where it returns to continental Europe.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ramblers.org.uk/info/paths/e9.html | author = Ramblers Association | title=E9 European Coastal Path / Sentier Européen du Littoral | accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl]
The South West Coast Path, covering such a wide area, inevitably intersects with other, more local, routes, and it connects with many other long-distance paths offering opportunities for even longer expeditions:

==Public transport==

There are regular train services from other parts of the UK to the south west, principal destination stations being Barnstaple, Exeter, Newquay, Penzance and Plymouth. From these places local trains or buses connect to many points of the path. Airports at Exeter and Newquay are served from a range of national and international destinations.
Using public transport for at least part of the journey means that walkers can plan walks that start and finish at different places, rather than having to circle back to their start point to collect their cars.
More than twenty railway stations give options either for short walks – such as Dawlish to Paignton — or for longer walks over several days. The West Somerset Railway offers steam and diesel services from Taunton to Minehead at the Somerset end of the path (using a connecting bus from Taunton railway station to [tpl]stnlnk|Bishops Lydeard[/tpl]), and the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway connects Kingswear and Paignton.
Long-distance bus services connect some coastal towns with railway stations:
A boat service runs down the River Fal from Truro to Falmouth and can be used as an interesting method to get to the path.

==Charity fundraising==

Many individuals or organisations use a walk on all or part of the path to raise money for charity.[tpl]cite web | author=SWCPA | title=Walks for charities | url=http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/charity-walks.html | accessdate=9 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080103024250/http://www.swcp.org.uk/walk/charity-walks.html |archivedate = 3 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author=Water Aid | title=Coast along: Thank you | url=http://www.coastalongforwateraid.org/[/tpl]https://sites.google.com/site/coastpathrun/home
