Compared to many other data-sparse representations of non-sparse matrices, hierarchical matrices offer a major advantage:
the results of matrix arithmetic operations like matrix multiplication, factorization or inversion can be approximated

==Basic idea==

Hierarchical matrices rely on local low-rank approximations:
Large submatrices are stored in factorized representation, while small submatrices are stored in standard representation
in order to improve the efficiency.
Low-rank matrices are closely related to degenerate expansions used in panel clustering and the fast multipole method
to approximate integral operators.
In this sense, hierarchical matrices can be considered the algebraic counterparts of these techniques.

==Application to integral operators==

Hierarchical matrices are successfully used to treat integral equations, e.g., the single and double layer potential operators
appearing in the boundary element method.
A typical operator has the form
The Galerkin method leads to matrix entries of the form

with the coefficients
would also allow us to split the double integral into two single integrals and thus arrive at a similar factorized low-rank matrix.
Of particular interest are cross approximation techniques

==Application to elliptic partial differential equations==

Since the solution operator of an elliptic partial differential equation can be expressed as an integral operator involving
can be approximated by a hierarchical matrix.
Green's function depends on the shape of the computational domain, therefore it is usually not known.
Nevertheless, approximate arithmetic operations can be employed to compute an approximate inverse without knowing the
function explicitly.
Surprisingly, it is possible to prove that the inverse can be approximated even if
the differential operator involves non-smooth coefficients and Green's function is therefore not smooth.

==Arithmetic operations==

The most important innovation of the hierarchical matrix method is the development of efficient algorithms for performing
(approximate) matrix arithmetic operations on non-sparse matrices, e.g., to compute approximate inverses, LU decompositions
and solutions to matrix equations.
The algorithm requires the submatrices of the hierarchical matrices to be organized in a block tree structure and takes
Taking advantage of the block structure, the inverse can be computed by using recursion to compute inverses and
Schur complements of diagonal blocks and combining both using the matrix-matrix multiplication.
In a similar way, the LU decomposition

can be constructed using only recursion and multiplication.

==H2-matrices==

In order to treat very large problems, the structure of hierarchical matrices can be improved:
