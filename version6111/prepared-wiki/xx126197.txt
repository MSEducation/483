==History and building==

The Brooklyn Historical Society was founded in 1863 by Henry Pierrepont (1808–1888)[tpl]cite book|last=Benardo|first=Leonard|title=Brooklyn by Name|year=2006|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York and London|isbn=978-0-8147-9945-1|pages=42[/tpl]  as the Long Island Historical Society', with a charter from the New England Historical Society in Boston.[tpl]cite inside[/tpl] pp. 145–146. In 1985, the society changed its name to the Brooklyn Historical Society.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/29/opinion/l-a-historic-change-for-a-historical-name-113004.html?scp=2&sq=%22long+Island+historical+society%22+%22brooklyn+historical+society%22&st=nyt| title=Historic Change for Historical Name | newspaper=New York Times | date=October 29, 1985 [/tpl]
The society's headquarters building, on the corner of Pierrepoint and Clinton Streets, was built in 1878–81 and was designed by George B. Post in the Renaissance revival style. Post was selected as a result of a competition between 14 architects.  The building's design utilizes terra cotta ornamentation made by the Perth Amboy Terra Cotta Company, and has architectural sculptures by Olin Levi Warner,[tpl]cite aia5[/tpl] pp.605–606 including busts of Michelangelo, Beethoven, Gutenberg, Shakespeare, Columbus, Benjamin Franklin, a Viking and a Native American.
The building has been described as "one of the City's great architectural treasures", and the interior as "one of New York's great 19th-century interiors."  It is part of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission's Brooklyn Heights Historic District, designated in 1966, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1991.[tpl]Cite web|url=[tpl]PDFlink|"Brooklyn Historical Society Building", December 10, 1990, by Carolyn Pitts|341 KB[/tpl]|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration|date=19839|publisher=National Park Service[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=[tpl]PDFlink|Brooklyn Historical Society Building--Accompanying 7 photos, exterior and interior, undated.|1.99 MB[/tpl]|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination|year=1983|publisher=National Park Service[/tpl] In October 1999, BHS began a full-scale restoration of the building, supervised by architect Jan Hird Pokorny, and reopened in 2003.Overview of History of the Brooklyn Historical Society

==Programs==

Principal activities of BHS include education programs, which are organized around a central educational concept of encouraging students to understand that history is connected to their lives.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] BHS programs link the study of American history to events and sites in the students’ own communities by introducing the investigation of primary source documents and neighborhood histories. BHS’ education programs largely focus on the ability of students to “read” primary source documents, including works of art, maps, photographs, and other artifacts.
BHS offers a schedule of programs designed to engage a broad range of audiences.  Programs range from topics in history and current affairs to exhibition related lectures, to musical events, walking tours, readings and plays.
Up to eight exhibitions each year are presented by BHS, ranging from comprehensive retrospectives and historical surveys to more focused presentations that explore specific themes and topics. Installations from the collection have included a gallery of family portraits and another of landscape paintings. These installations rotate over time, providing visitors with greater access to BHS’ fine arts collections.
In December 2007, BHS opened the first gallery in the United States devoted to oral history.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] The first exhibition installed in the gallery was an installation of oral histories, photographs, documents, and artifacts called "In Our Own Words: Portraits of Brooklyn's Vietnam Veterans".
