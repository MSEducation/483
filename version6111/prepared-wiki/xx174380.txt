[[Dala Township]]

CATEGORIES: Townships of Yangon

Dala Township ([tpl]lang-my|ဒလ မြို့နယ်[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-my|dəla̰ mjo̰nɛ̀|pron[/tpl]) is located on the southern bank of Yangon river across from downtown Yangon, Myanmar. The township, consisted of 23 wards, is bounded by the Yangon river in the north and east, the Twante Canal in the west, and Twante Township in the south. Despite its strategic location across downtown Yangon, the township is still largely rural and undeveloped mainly because it still lacks a bridge across the Yangon river to downtown.
Dala has 16 primary schools, and one high school.
