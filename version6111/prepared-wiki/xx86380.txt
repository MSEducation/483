The Maury Island Incident refers to claims made by Fred Crisman and Harold Dahl of falling debris and threats by men in black following sightings of unidentified flying objects in the sky over Maury Island in Puget Sound in June 1947. Dahl later retracted his claims, stating the story was a hoax. 
Crisman and Dahl said they were harbor patrolmen on a workboat who saw six doughnut shaped objects in the sky near Maury Island. According to Crisman and Dahl, one of the objects dropped a substance that resembled lava or "white metal" onto their boat, breaking a worker's arm and killing a dog. Dahl claimed he was later approached by a man in a dark suit and told not to talk about the incident.[tpl]cite book|author=Albert A.

The substance claimed to have been dropped by the objects was found to be slag from a local smelter. Years later, Dahl confessed to a reporter that the incident was a hoax.
