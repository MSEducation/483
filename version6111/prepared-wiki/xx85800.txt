CATEGORIES: Splatterpunk, Horror fiction

Splatterpunk—a term coined in 1986 by David J. Schow at the Twelfth World Fantasy Convention in Providence, Rhode Island—refers to a movement within horror fiction distinguished by its graphic, often gory, depiction of violence and "hyperintensive horror with no limits."[tpl]cite web |author=Carroll, David|title=Splatterpunk |date=1995 |work=Tabula Rasa #6 |url=http://www.tabula-rasa.info/Horror/Splatterpunk.html |accessdate=2008-10-10 [/tpl]000407 - Splatterpunk[ref]"Schow, David J." by

Splatterpunk has been defined as a "literary genre characterised by graphically described scenes of an extremely gory nature."Warren Clements, "A quick course in Euro-surgery". The Globe and Mail September 28, 1996. 
Michael Shea's short fiction "The Autopsy" (1980) has been described as a "proto-splatterpunk" 
story.[ref]Robert A. Collins, Robert Latham, Science Fiction and Fantasy Book Review Annual Meckler, 1989

Splatterpunk provoked considerable controversy among horror writers. Robert Bloch criticised the movement, stating "there is a distinction to be made between that which inspires terror and that which inspires nausea".[ref]Paul Bail,

the movement.[ref] Rob Latham,

the latter stating splatterpunk was a "survivalist" literature that "reflects the moral chaos of 
our times".
Though the term gained some prominence in the 1980s and 1990s, and, as a movement, attracted a cult following, the term "splatterpunk" has since been replaced by other synonymous terms for the genre.[tpl]cite web |url=http://diewachen.com/2007/07/types-of-horror_24.html |title=Types of Horror/All Sorts of Punk |accessdate=2008-10-10 |author=Remy, J.E. |date=2007-07-24 |work=Die Wachen[/tpl] The last major commercial endeavor aimed at the Splatterpunk audience was 1995's Splatterpunks II: Over the Edge, an anthology of short stories which also included essays on horror cinema and an interview with Anton LaVey. By 1998, one
commentator was stating that interest in splatterpunk was declining, noting such interest "seemed to have reached a peak" in 
the mid-1990s.Jane Sullivan, "Schlock Horror". Sunday Age July, 19th, 1998, (p. 15).  
The term is still sometimes used for horror with a strong gruesome element, such as Philip Nutman's novel Cities of Night.[ref]Publisher's Weekly's review described 
Cities of Night as "seasoned with a dash of splatterpunk".
Publishers' Weekly, May 22, 2010. [/ref]
