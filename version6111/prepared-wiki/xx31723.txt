Sir David Frederick Attenborough [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|t|ən|b|ər|ə[/tpl] OM CH CVO CBE FRS FZS FSA (born 8 May 1926)http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/42130/Sir-David-Attenborough is an English broadcaster and naturalist.
His career as the face and voice of natural history programmes has endured for 60 years. He is best known for writing and presenting the nine Life series, in conjunction with the BBC Natural History Unit, which collectively form a comprehensive survey of all life on the planet. He is also a former senior manager at the BBC, having served as controller of BBC Two and director of programming for BBC Television in the 1960s and 1970s. He is the only person to have won BAFTAs for programmes in each of black and white, colour, HD and 3D.
Attenborough is widely considered a national treasure in Britain, although he himself does not like the term.[tpl]cite web|last=Waldemayer |first=Winston |url=http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/01/eye-burrowing-worms-national-t.html |title=Short Sharp Science: Eye-burrowing worms, national treasures... and creationism |work=New Scientist |date=28 January 2009 |accessdate=26 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/4413130/Sir-David-Attenborough-Man-was-given-permission-to-exploit-the-natural-world-by-the-Bible.html |title=Sir David Attenborough: 'Man was given permission to exploit the natural world by the Bible' |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 31 January 2009|accessdate=26 November 2011 |location=London |first=Paul |last=Kendall[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2982907/Margaret-Thatcher-Richard-Branson-and-Judi-Dench-picked-as-National-Treasures.html |title=Margaret Thatcher, Richard Branson and Judi Dench picked as National Treasures |work=The Telegraph |date=18 September 2008 |accessdate=26 November 2011 |location=London[/tpl] In 2002 he was named among the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-134458/100-great-Britons--A-complete-list.html |title=100 great Britons - A complete list |work=Daily Mail |date=21 August 2002 |accessdate=5 August 2012[/tpl] He is a younger brother of the director, producer and actor Richard Attenborough.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.richardattenborough.com/Biography/ |title=Richard Attenborough's official website: Biography |publisher=Richardattenborough.com  |accessdate=2 January 2011[/tpl]

==Early life and family==

Attenborough was born in Isleworth, west London, but grew up in College House on the campus of the University College, Leicester, where his father, Frederick, was principal.[tpl]Wayback |df=yes|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/careers/collegehouse.html |title=History of College House |date=20060924005526[/tpl] He is the middle of three sons (his elder brother, Richard, became an actor and his younger brother, John, an executive at Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo).[tpl]Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20001126/ai_n14516598/|title=The Missing Link; We find Attenborough brother No. 3|last=O'Hanlon|first=Terry|date=26 November 2000|work=Sunday Mirror|accessdate=23 November 2009|location=London[/tpl] During World War II, through a British government initiative known as Kindertransport, his parents also fostered two Jewish refugee girls from Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/comment/essays/britain-refuge-real-story |title=Britain as refuge: the real story |publisher=The Jewish Chronicle|date=23 October 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2013[/tpl]
Attenborough spent his childhood collecting fossils, stones and other natural specimens. He received encouragement in this pursuit at age seven, when a young Jacquetta Hawkes admired his "museum." 
He also spent a considerable amount of his time in the grounds of the university and aged 11 he heard that the zoology department needed a large supply of newts which he offered via his father to supply for 3d a newt. The source, which wasn't revealed at the time, was a pond less than 5 metres from the department.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Picture-day-12-Leicester-celebs-famous/story-20596134-detail/story.html|title=Picture of the day: Leicester celebs, before they were famous|work=Leicester Mercury|date=11 February 2014|accessdate=11 February 2014[/tpl]  A few years later, one of his adoptive sisters gave him a piece of amber filled with prehistoric creatures; some 50 years later, it would be the focus of his programme The Amber Time Machine.
Attenborough was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and then won a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge in 1945, where he studied geology and zoology and obtained a degree in natural sciences.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clarealumni.com/s/845/file_lib/1/1/clarenews11_633540413018489651.pdf |title=Cover.Qxd |format=PDF |accessdate=4 November 2009[/tpl] In 1947 he was called up for national service in the Royal Navy and spent two years stationed in North Wales and the Firth of Forth.
In 1950 Attenborough married Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel; the marriage lasted until her death in 1997. The couple had two children, Robert and Susan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/plain/A20218628 |title=Sir David Attenborough - Naturalist |publisher=BBC |accessdate=26 November 2011[/tpl] Robert is a senior lecturer in bioanthropology for the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University in Canberra.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archanth.anu.edu.au/staff/dr-robert-attenborough |title=Dr Robert Attenborough - School of Archaeology & Anthropology - ANU |publisher=Arts.anu.edu.au |date=9 July 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2009[/tpl]

==First years at the BBC==

After leaving the Navy, Attenborough took a position editing children's science textbooks for a publishing company. He soon became disillusioned with the work and in 1950 applied for a job as a radio talk producer with the BBC. Although he was rejected for this job, his CV later attracted the interest of Mary Adams, head of the Talks (factual broadcasting) department of the BBC's fledgling television service. Attenborough, like most Britons at that time, did not own a television, and he had seen only one programme in his life.[tpl]Cite book|author=Attenborough, David|title=Life on Air|publisher=BBC Books|year=2002|isbn=0-563-53461-3[/tpl] pp. 10-11. However, he accepted Adams' offer of a three-month training course, and in 1952 he joined the BBC full-time. Initially discouraged from appearing on camera because Adams thought his teeth were too big,Life on Air, p.13. he became a producer for the Talks department, which handled all non-fiction broadcasts. His early projects included the quiz show Animal, Vegetable, Mineral? and Song Hunter, a series about folk music presented by Alan Lomax.
Attenborough's association with natural history programmes began when he produced and presented the three-part series The Pattern of Animals. The studio-bound programme featured animals from London Zoo, with the naturalist Julian Huxley discussing their use of camouflage, aposematism and courtship displays. Through this programme, Attenborough met Jack Lester, the curator of the zoo's reptile house, and they decided to make a series about an animal-collecting expedition. The result was Zoo Quest, first broadcast in 1954, where Attenborough became the presenter at short notice due to Lester being taken ill.
In 1957 the BBC Natural History Unit was formally established in Bristol. Attenborough was asked to join it, but declined, not wishing to move from London where he and his young family were settled. Instead, he formed his own department, the Travel and Exploration Unit,Life on Air, pp.60-61. which allowed him to continue to front Zoo Quest as well as produce other documentaries, notably the Travellers' Tales and Adventure series.
In the early 1960s, Attenborough resigned from the permanent staff of the BBC to study for a postgraduate degree in social anthropology at the London School of Economics, interweaving his study with further filming.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/helpers/force-download.php?file=pdf/David_Attenborough.pdf |title=Transcript of interview with David Attenborough |format=PDF |accessdate=4 November 2009[/tpl] However, he accepted an invitation to return to the BBC as controller of BBC Two before he could finish the degree.

==BBC administration==

Attenborough became the controller of BBC Two in March 1965, but had a clause inserted in his contract that would allow him to continue making programmes on an occasional basis. Later the same year, he filmed elephants in Tanzania, and in 1969, he made a three-part series on the cultural history of the Indonesian island of Bali. For the 1971 film A Blank on the Map, he joined the first Western expedition to a remote highland valley in New Guinea to seek out a lost tribe.
BBC Two was launched in 1964, but had struggled to capture the public's imagination. When Attenborough arrived as controller, he quickly abolished the channel's quirky kangaroo mascot and shook up the schedule. With a mission to make BBC Two's output diverse and different from that offered by other networks, he began to establish a portfolio of programmes that defined the channel's identity for decades to come. Under his tenure, music, the arts, entertainment, archaeology, experimental comedy, travel, drama, sport, business, science and natural history all found a place in the weekly schedules. Often, an eclectic mix was offered within a single evening's viewing. Programmes he commissioned included Man Alive, Call My Bluff, Chronicle, Life, One Pair of Eyes, The Old Grey Whistle Test, Monty Python's Flying Circus and The Money Programme. When BBC Two became the first British channel to broadcast in colour in 1967, Attenborough took advantage by introducing televised snooker, as well as bringing rugby league to British television on a regular basis via the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy.
One of his most significant decisions was to order a 13-part series on the history of Western art, to show off the quality of the new UHF colour television service that BBC Two offered. Broadcast to universal acclaim in 1969, Civilisation set the blueprint for landmark authored documentaries, which were informally known as "tombstone" or "sledgehammer" projects. Others followed, including Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man (also commissioned by Attenborough), and Alistair Cooke's America. Attenborough thought that the story of evolution would be a natural subject for such a series. He shared his idea with Chris Parsons, a producer at the Natural History Unit, who came up with the title Life on Earth and returned to Bristol to start planning the series. Attenborough harboured a strong desire to present the series himself, but this would not be possible so long as he remained in a management post.
In 1969 Attenborough was promoted to director of programmes, making him responsible for the output of both BBC channels. His tasks, which included agreeing budgets, attending board meetings and firing staff were now far removed from the business of filming programmes. When Attenborough's name was being suggested as a candidate for the position of Director General of the BBC in 1972 he phoned his brother Richard to confess that he had no appetite for the job. Early the following year, he left his post to return to full-time programme-making, leaving him free to write and present the planned natural history epic.

==Return to broadcasting==

After his resignation, Attenborough became a freelance broadcaster and immediately started work on his next project, a pre-arranged trip to Indonesia with a crew from the Natural History Unit. It resulted in the 1973 series Eastwards with Attenborough, which was similar in tone to the earlier Zoo Quests but without the animal-collecting element.
After his return, he began to work on the scripts for Life on Earth. Due to the scale of his ambition, the BBC decided to partner with an American network to secure the necessary funding. While the negotiations were proceeding he worked on a number of other television projects. He presented a series on tribal art (The Tribal Eye, 1975) and another on the voyages of discovery (The Explorers, 1975). He also presented a BBC children's series about cryptozoology entitled Fabulous Animals (1975), which featured mythical creatures such as the griffin and kraken.[tpl]cite web|last=Gately |first=Martin |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/101/attenboroughs_fabulous_animals.html |title=Fortean Times episode guide to Fabulous Animals |publisher=Forteantimes.com |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=4 November 2009[/tpl] Eventually, the BBC signed a co-production deal with Turner Broadcasting and Life on Earth moved into production in 1976.

===Life series===

Beginning with Life on Earth in 1979, Attenborough set about creating a body of work which became a benchmark of quality in wildlife film-making and influenced a generation of documentary film-makers. The series also established many of the hallmarks of the BBC's natural history output. By treating his subject seriously and researching the latest discoveries, Attenborough and his production team gained the trust of scientists, who responded by allowing him to feature their subjects in his programmes. In Rwanda, for example, Attenborough and his crew were granted privileged access to film Dian Fossey's research group of mountain gorillas. Innovation was another factor in Life on Earth's success: new film-making techniques were devised to get the shots Attenborough wanted, with a focus on events and animals that were hitherto unfilmed. Computerised airline schedules, which had only recently been introduced, enabled the series to be elaborately devised so that Attenborough visited several locations around the globe in each episode, sometimes even changing continents mid-sentence. Although appearing as the on-screen presenter, he consciously restricted his pieces to camera to give his subjects top billing.
The success of Life on Earth prompted the BBC to consider a follow-up, and five years later, The Living Planet was screened. This time, Attenborough built his series around the theme of ecology, the adaptations of living things to their environment. It was another critical and commercial success, generating huge international sales for the BBC. In 1990 The Trials of Life completed the original Life trilogy, looking at animal behaviour through the different stages of life. The series drew strong reactions from the viewing public for its sequences of killer whales hunting sea lions on a Patagonian beach and chimpanzees hunting and violently killing a colobus monkey.
In the 1990s, Attenborough continued to use the "Life" moniker for a succession of authored documentaries. In 1993 he presented Life in the Freezer, the first television series to survey the natural history of Antarctica. Although past normal retirement age, he then embarked on a number of more specialised surveys of the natural world, beginning with plants. They proved a difficult subject for his producers, who had to deliver five hours of television featuring what are essentially immobile objects. The result, The Private Life of Plants (1995), showed plants as dynamic organisms by using time-lapse photography to speed up their growth.
Prompted by an enthusiastic ornithologist at the BBC Natural History Unit, Attenborough then turned his attention to the animal kingdom and in particular, birds. As he was neither an obsessive twitcher, nor a bird expert, he decided he was better qualified to make The Life of Birds (1998) on the theme of behaviour. The order of the remaining "Life" series was dictated by developments in camera technology. For The Life of Mammals (2002), low-light and infrared cameras were deployed to reveal the behaviour of nocturnal mammals. The series contains a number of memorable two shots of Attenborough and his subjects, which included chimpanzees, a blue whale and a grizzly bear. Advances in macro photography made it possible to capture natural behaviour of very small creatures for the first time, and in 2005, Life in the Undergrowth introduced audiences to the world of invertebrates.
At this point, Attenborough realised that he had spent 20 years unconsciously assembling a collection of programmes on all the major groups of terrestrial animals and plants – only reptiles and amphibians were missing. When Life in Cold Blood was broadcast in 2008, he had the satisfaction of completing the set, brought together in a DVD encyclopaedia called Life on Land. In an interview that year, Attenborough was asked to sum up his achievement, and responded:
However, in 2010 Attenborough asserted that his First Life — dealing with evolutionary history before Life on Earth — should also be included within the "Life" series. In the documentary Attenborough's Journey he stated, "This series, to a degree which I really didn't fully appreciate until I started working on it, really completes the set."Attenborough's Journey, BBC Two, 24 October 2010

===Other documentaries===

Alongside the "Life" series, Attenborough has continued to work on other television documentaries, mainly in the natural history genre. He wrote and presented a series on man's influence on the natural history of the Mediterranean basin, The First Eden, in 1987. Two years later, he demonstrated his passion for fossils in Lost Worlds Vanished Lives.
Attenborough narrated every episode of Wildlife on One, a BBC One wildlife series which ran for 253 episodes between 1977 and 2005. At its peak, it drew a weekly audience of eight to ten million, and the 1987 episode "Meerkats United" was voted the best wildlife documentary of all time by BBC viewers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/film/151/Meerkats+United.html |title=Meerkats United |publisher=WildFilmistory.org |accessdate=20 January 2010[/tpl] He has also narrated over 50 episodes of Natural World, BBC Two's flagship wildlife series. (Its forerunner, The World About Us, was created by Attenborough in 1969, as a vehicle for colour television.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/madeintheuk/pdfs/5_david_attenborough_where_the_wild_things_are.pdf |title="Where the Wild Things Are" (Essay for BBC "Made in the Uk") |publisher=BBC |first=David |last=Attenborough |accessdate=20 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]) In 1997 he narrated the BBC Wildlife Specials, each focussing on a charismatic species, and screened to mark the Natural History Unit's 40th anniversary.
As a writer and narrator, he continued to collaborate with the BBC Natural History Unit in the new millennium. Alastair Fothergill, a senior producer with whom Attenborough had worked on The Trials of Life and Life in the Freezer, was making The Blue Planet (2001), the Unit's first comprehensive series on marine life. He decided not to use an on-screen presenter due to difficulties in speaking to camera through diving apparatus, but asked Attenborough to narrate the films. The same team reunited for Planet Earth (2006), the biggest nature documentary ever made for television and the first BBC wildlife series to be shot in high definition. In 2011 Fothergill gave Attenborough a more prominent role in Frozen Planet, a major series on the natural history of the polar regions. Attenborough appeared on screen and authored the final episode, in addition to performing voiceover duties.
In 2009 he co-wrote and narrated Life, a ten-part series focussing on extraordinary animal behaviour,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/sep/21/bbc.television1 |title=Attenborough is back - again |date=21 September 2007 |work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood | accessdate=28 March 2010[/tpl] and narrated Nature's Great Events, which showed how seasonal changes trigger major natural spectacles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/01_january/05/nature.shtml |title=Nature's Great Events Press Pack |publisher=BBC Press Office |date=11 February 2009[/tpl]
By the turn of the millennium, Attenborough's authored documentaries were adopting a more overtly environmentalist stance. In State of the Planet (2000), he used the latest scientific evidence and interviews with leading scientists and conservationists to assess the impact of man's activities on the natural world. He later turned to the issues of global warming (The Truth about Climate Change, 2006) and human population growth (How Many People Can Live on Planet Earth?, 2009). He also contributed a programme which highlighted the plight of endangered species to the BBC's Saving Planet Earth project in 2007, the 50th anniversary of the Natural History Unit.
Attenborough is also forging a new partnership with Sky, working on documentaries for the broadcaster's new 3D network, Sky 3D. Their first collaboration was Flying Monsters 3D, a film about pterosaurs which debuted on Christmas Day of 2010.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8606923.stm |title=Sir David Attenborough to front Sky 3D wildlife show |publisher=BBC News Online |date=7 April 2010[/tpl] A second film, The Bachelor King 3D, followed a year later, and further collaborations are planned.

===Current projects===

Attenborough celebrated his 60th year in broadcasting in 2012 and continues to work on a number of television, film and radio projects. In fall 2013 he will return to BBC television for a two-part series on the origins of vertebrates, provisionally titled Rise of Animals, a follow-up to the 2010 series First Life.[tpl]cite web |last=Rajesh |first=Monisha |title=Attenborough, Atlantic teaming up for second "First Life" |url=http://realscreen.com/2011/12/23/exclusive-attenborough-atlantic-teaming-up-for-second-first-life/ |publisher=realscreen.com |accessdate=16 May 2012[/tpl] Later in the year David Attenborough's Natural Curiosities will return to Eden for a second series, this time with an extended run of ten episodes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvwise.co.uk/2013/04/eden-renews-david-attenboroughs-natural-curiosities-for-10-episode-second-season/|title=Eden Renews 'David Attenborough's Natural Curiosities' For 10 Episode Second Season|publisher=TVWise.co.uk|accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl]

On radio, Attenborough has recently contributed to BBC Radio 4's "Tweet of the Day", a series of short guides to 265 British birds through their songs and calls. A third series of David Attenborough's Life Stories has also been commissioned by the station.

==Other work==

From 1983 Attenborough worked on two environmentally themed musicals with the WWF and writers Peter Rose and Anne Conlon. Yanomamo was the first, about the Amazon rainforest, and the second, Ocean World, premiered at the Royal Festival Hall in 1991. They were both narrated by Attenborough on their national tour, and recorded on to audio cassette. Ocean World was also filmed for Channel 4 and later released.

===Recognition===

Attenborough has been featured as the subject of a number of BBC television programmes. Life on Air (2002) examined the legacy of his work and Attenborough the Controller (2002) focused on his time in charge of BBC Two. He was also featured prominently in The Way We Went Wild (2004), a series about natural history television presenters, and 100 Years of Wildlife Films (2007), a special programme marking the centenary of the nature documentary. In 2006 British television viewers were asked to vote for their Favourite Attenborough Moments for a UKTV poll to coincide with the broadcaster's 80th birthday. The winning clip showed Attenborough observing the mimicry skills of the superb lyrebird.
Attenborough was named as the most trusted celebrity in Britain in a 2006 Reader's Digest poll,.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,1696927,00.html |title=In David we trust ... but not Peter |work=The Guardian |last=Hoggart |first=Simon |date=28 January 2006 |location=London[/tpl] and the following year he won The Culture Show's Living Icon Award.[tpl]cite web|author=culture show |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/livingicons/bio01.shtml |title=Living Icons - David Attenborough |publisher=BBC |accessdate=31 October 2009[/tpl] He has also been named among the 100 Greatest Britons in a 2002 BBC poll and is one of the top ten "Heroes of Our Time" according to New Statesman magazine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200605220016 |title=Heroes of our time - the top 50 |work=New Statesman |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110428104750/http://www.newstatesman.com/200605220016|archivedate=28 April 2011[/tpl]
He has the distinction of having a number of newly discovered species and fossils being named in his honour. In 1993 after discovering that the Mesozoic reptile Plesiosaurus conybeari had not, in fact, been a true plesiosaur, the palaeontologist Robert Bakker renamed the species Attenborosaurus conybeari.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dinosauria.com/dml/names/ples.html |title=Plesiosauria Translation and Pronunciation Guide |publisher=Dinosauria.com |accessdate=4 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] A fossilised armoured fish discovered at the Gogo Formation in Western Australia in 2008 was given the name Materpiscis attenboroughi, after Attenborough had filmed at the site and highlighted its scientific importance in Life on Earth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/05/080528-mother-fossil.html |title=Oldest Live-Birth Fossil Found; Fish Had Umbilical Cord |publisher=National Geographic News |date=28 May 2008[/tpl] The Materpiscis fossil is believed to be the earliest organism capable of internal fertilisation.
He has also lent his name to a species of Ecuadorian flowering tree (Blakea attenboroughi), one of the world's largest-pitchered carnivorous plants (Nepenthes attenboroughii), a Madagascan ghost shrimp, the millimetre-long Attenborough's goblin spider and one of only four species of long-beaked echidna, the critically endangered Zaglossus attenboroughi, discovered by explorer and zoologist Tim Flannery in the Cyclops Mountains of New Guinea in 1998.
In September 2009 London's Natural History Museum opened the Attenborough Studio, part of its Darwin Centre development.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8254804.stm |title=Prince opens £78m Darwin Centre |publisher=BBC News |date=14 September 2009[/tpl] In December 2013, he was awarded the freedom of the city of Bristol.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-25413238|title=BBC News - Sir David Attenborough awarded freedom of Bristol|date=17 December 2013|work=BBC Online|accessdate=17 December 2013[/tpl]

In 1973 he was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on The Language of Animals.

==Views and advocacy==

===Environmental causes===

Attenborough's programmes have often included references to the impact of human society on the natural world. The last episode of The Living Planet, for example, focuses almost entirely on humans' destruction of the environment and ways that it could be stopped or reversed. Despite this, he has been criticised for not giving enough prominence to environmental messages. Some environmentalists feel that programmes like Attenborough's give a false picture of idyllic wilderness and do not do enough to acknowledge that such areas are increasingly encroached upon by humans.James Fair, "Small Things Bright and Beautiful", BBC Wildlife Magazine, November 2005, pp. 25-26.
However, his closing message from State of the Planet was forthright:
 The future of life on earth depends on our ability to take action. Many individuals are doing what they can, but real success can only come if there's a change in our societies and our economics and in our politics. I've been lucky in my lifetime to see some of the greatest spectacles that the natural world has to offer. Surely we have a responsibility to leave for future generations a planet that is healthy, inhabitable by all species. 
Attenborough has subsequently become more vocal in his support of environmental causes. In 2005 and 2006 he backed a BirdLife International project to stop the killing of albatross by longline fishing boats.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.savethealbatross.net/the_latest/the_latest_item.asp?newsid=24 |title=Personal plea by David Attenborough |publisher=savethealbatross.net |date=27 January 2006[/tpl] He gave public support to WWF's campaign to have 220,000 square kilometres of Borneo's rainforest designated a protected area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wwf.org.uk/core/about/ta_0000001801.asp |title=Sir David Attenborough: Heart of Borneo is a global heritage |publisher=WWF-UK press release[/tpl] He also serves as a vice-president of BTCV, vice-president of Fauna and Flora International, president of Butterfly Conservation and president of Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust. In 2003 he launched an appeal on behalf of the World Land Trust to create a rainforest reserve in Ecuador in memory of Christopher Parsons, the producer of Life on Earth and a personal friend, who had died the previous year. The same year, he helped to launch ARKive,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/conservation/story/0,,969572,00.html |title=Arkive sets sail on the web |work=The Guardian |date=20 May 2003 |location=London |first=Ashley |last=Davies[/tpl] a global project instigated by Parsons to gather together natural history media into a digital library. ARKive is an initiative of Wildscreen, of which Attenborough is a patron.[tpl]cite book|title=WildScreen Annual Review 2010|url=http://www.wildscreen.org.uk/downloads/AnnualReview2010.pdf|accessdate=11 July 2011|publisher=Wildscreen[/tpl] He later became patron of the World Land Trust, and an active supporter. He supported Glyndebourne in their successful application to obtain planning permission for a wind turbine in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and gave evidence at the planning inquiry arguing in favour of the proposal.
Attenborough has repeatedly said that he considers human overpopulation to be the root cause of many environmental problems. In The Life of Mammals, he made a plea for humans to curb population growth so that other species will not be crowded out. In 2009 he became a patron of Population Matters (formerly known as the Optimum Population Trust), a UK charity advocating sustainable human populations.
He has written and spoken publicly about the fact that, despite past scepticism, he believes the Earth's climate is warming in a way that is cause for concern, and that this can likely be attributed to human activity.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/article570935.ece |title=Climate change is the major challenge facing the world |last=Attenborough |first=David |work=The Independent |date=24 May 2006 |location=London[/tpl] He summed up his thoughts at the end of his 2006 documentary "Can We Save Planet Earth?" as follows:
 In the past, we didn't understand the effect of our actions. Unknowingly, we sowed the wind and now, literally, we are reaping the whirlwind. But we no longer have that excuse: now we do recognise the consequences of our behaviour. Now surely, we must act to reform it —  individually and collectively, nationally and internationally — or we doom future generations to catastrophe. 
In a 2005 interview with BBC Wildlife magazine, Attenborough said he considered George W. Bush to be the era's top "environmental villain". In 2007 he further elaborated on the USA's consumption of energy in relation to its population. When asked if he thought America to be "the villain of the piece", he responded:
 I don't think whole populations are villainous, but Americans are just extraordinarily unaware of all kinds of things. If you live in the middle of that vast continent, with apparently everything your heart could wish for just because you were born there, then why worry? ... If people lose knowledge, sympathy and understanding of the natural world, they're going to mistreat it and will not ask their politicians to care for it.Interview in the Radio Times 23–29 June 2007 
In 2012 Attenborough was quoted as saying that the planet has always and will always look after itself but:
  what worries him most about the future of the natural world is that people are out of touch with it ... over half the world is urbanised; some people don't see any real thing except a rat or a pigeon ... ecosystems are incredibly complex and you fiddle with them at your peril."[tpl]cite journal|last=Wheatley|first=Jane|title=The Life of Attenborough - a rare glimpse into the private world of Sir David|journal=Good Weekend in The Sydney Morning Herald|date=28 July 2012|pages=12–15[/tpl] 

===Attitude to religion and creationism===

In a December 2005 interview with Simon Mayo on BBC Radio Five Live, Attenborough stated that he considers himself an agnostic.Interview[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] with Simon Mayo, BBC Radio Five Live, 2 December 2005 When asked whether his observation of the natural world has given him faith in a creator, he generally responds with some version of this story, making reference to the Onchocerca volvulus parasitic worm:
 My response is that when Creationists talk about God creating every individual species as a separate act, they always instance hummingbirds, or orchids, sunflowers and beautiful things. But I tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through the eye of a boy sitting on the bank of a river in West Africa, worm that's going to make him blind. And ask them, 'Are you telling me that the God you believe in, who you also say is an all-merciful God, who cares for each one of us individually, are you saying that God created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent child's eyeball? Because that doesn't seem to me to coincide with a God who's full of mercy'.David Attenborough, 2003. "Wild, wild life." Sydney Morning Herald, 25 March. Attenborough has also told this story in numerous other interviews. 
He has explained that he feels the evidence all over the planet clearly shows evolution to be the best way to explain the diversity of life, and that "as far as he's concerned, if there is a supreme being then he chose organic evolution as a way of bringing into existence the natural world." In a BBC Four interview with Mark Lawson, he was asked if he at any time had any religious faith. He replied simply, "No."BBC Today programme, 31 January 2009 He has also said "It never really occurred to me to believe in God".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mandrake/4347954/Sir-David-Attenborough-questioned-on-faith-naturally.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph |  author=Walker, Tim | title=Sir David Attenborough questioned on faith, naturally | date=26 January 2009[/tpl]
In 2002 Attenborough joined an effort by leading clerics and scientists to oppose the inclusion of creationism in the curriculum of UK state-funded independent schools which receive private sponsorship, such as the Emmanuel Schools Foundation.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/27/david-attenborough-science|title=Attenborough reveals creationist hate mail for not crediting God|last=Butt|first=Riazat|date=27 January 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=27 January 2009[/tpl]
In 2009 he stated that the Book of Genesis, by saying that the world was there for people to dominate, had taught generations that they can "dominate" the environment, and that this has resulted in the devastation of vast areas of the environment. He further explained to the science journal Nature, "That's why Darwinism, and the fact of evolution, is of great importance, because it is that attitude which has led to the devastation of so much, and we are in the situation that we are in."[tpl]cite web |url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/01/david_attenborough_on_darwin_e.html |title=The Great Beyond: David Attenborough on Darwin, evolution and the Bible |work=Nature |accessdate=14 February 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid|19225509[/tpl]
Also in early 2009, the BBC broadcast an Attenborough one-hour special, Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life. In reference to the programme, Attenborough stated that "People write to me that evolution is only a theory. Well, it is not a theory. Evolution is as solid a historical fact as you could conceive. Evidence from every quarter. What is a theory is whether natural selection is the mechanism and the only mechanism. That is a theory. But the historical reality that dinosaurs led to birds and mammals produced whales, that's not theory." He strongly opposes creationism and its offshoot "intelligent design", saying that a survey that found a quarter of science teachers in state schools believe that creationism should be taught alongside evolution in science lessons was "really terrible".
In March 2009 Attenborough appeared on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. Attenborough stated that he felt evolution did not rule out the existence of a God and accepted the title of agnostic saying, "My view is: I don't know one way or the other but I don't think that evolution is against a belief in God."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvoJSlcIYmM |title=David Attenborough on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross |publisher=YouTube |date=31 October 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2009[/tpl]
Attenborough has joined the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and other top scientists in signing a campaign statement coordinated by the British Humanist Association (BHA). The statement calls for "creationism to be banned from the school science curriculum and for evolution to be taught more widely in schools."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8769353/David-Attenborough-joins-campaign-against-creationism-in-schools.html| title=David Attenborough joins campaign against creationism in schools| work=The Daily Telegraph| date=19 September 2011| accessdate=22 September 2011| author=Collins, Nick[/tpl]

===BBC and public service broadcasting===

Attenborough is a lifelong supporter of the BBC, public broadcasting and the television licence. He has said:
 PSB, to me, is not about selecting individual programme strands here or there, financing them from some outside source and then foisting them upon commercial networks. Public Service Broadcasting, watched by a healthy number of viewers, with programmes financed in proportion to their intrinsic needs and not the size of the audience, can only effectively operate as a network — a network whose aim is to cater for the broadest possible range of interests, popular as well as less popular, a network that measures its success not only by its audience size but by the range of its schedule.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/thefuture/transcript_atten6.shtml | title= The BBC and the future of public service broadcasting[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] 
 Public service broadcasting is one of the things that distinguishes this country and makes me want to live here. I have spent all my life in it. I would be very distressed if public service broadcasting was weakened. I have been at the BBC since 1952, and know the BBC is constantly being battered. It is today.[tpl]Cite news| url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1921592/Sir-David-Attenborough-enters-political-jungle.html | title= Sir David Attenborough enters political jungle | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Pierce | date=2 May 2008 | accessdate=28 March 2010[/tpl] 
 If you could demonstrate that the BBC was grossly extravagant there might be a case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There is a lot of people who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling. 
 There have always been politicians or business people who have wanted to cut the BBC back or stop it saying the sort of things it says. There's always been trouble about the licence and if you dropped your guard you could bet our bottom dollar there'd be plenty of people who'd want to take it away. The licence fee is the basis on which the BBC is based and if you destroy it, broadcasting... becomes a wasteland.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/news/attenborough-backs-ross/1925560.article | title= Attenborough backs Ross[/tpl] 
Attenborough expressed regret at some of the changes made to the BBC in the 1990s by its Director-General, John Birt, who introduced an internal market at the corporation, slimmed and even closed some departments and outsourced much of the corporation’s output to private production companies, in line with the Broadcasting Act 1990. He has said:
 There is no question but that Birtism... has had some terrible results. On the other hand, the BBC had to change. Now it has to produce programmes no one else can do. Otherwise, forget the licence fee.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.newstatesman.com/199812180019 | title= The New Statesman Interview - David Attenborough[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] 
 The Bristol Unit has suffered along with the rest of the BBC from recent staff cuts. Yet it remains confident in the belief that the BBC will maintain it, in spite of the vagaries of fashion, because the Corporation believes that such programmes deserve a place in the schedules of any broadcaster with pretensions of providing a Public Service. In due course, similar specialist Units were also established in London, in order to produce programmes on archaeology and history, on the arts, on music and on science. They too, at one time, had their successes. But they have not survived as well as the Unit in Bristol. The statutory requirement that a certain percentage of programmes must come from independent producers has reduced in-house production and the Units necessarily shrank proportionately in size. As they dwindled, so the critical mass of their production expertise has diminished. The continuity of their archives has been broken, they have lost the close touch they once had worldwide with their subjects and they are no longer regarded internationally as the centres of innovation and expertise that they once were.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/thefuture/transcript_atten4.shtml | title= The BBC and the future of public service broadcasting[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] 
 When Birt gets up and says the whole of the BBC was a creative mess and it was wasteful, I never saw any evidence of that. I absolutely know it wasn’t so in my time. Producers now spend all their time worrying about money, and the thing has suffered for it.[tpl]Cite news| url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article820515.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1 | title= Interview: Marguerite Driscoll meets Sir David Attenborough: So much jollier than being DG | location=London | work=The Times | date=3 November 2002 | accessdate=28 March 2010 | first=Fiona | last=Hamilton[/tpl] 
In 2008 he criticised the BBC’s television schedules:
 I have to say that there are moments when I wonder — moments when its two senior networks, first set up as a partnership, schedule simultaneously programmes of identical character, thereby contradicting the very reason that the BBC was given a second network. Then there are times when both BBC One and BBC Two, intoxicated by the sudden popularity of a programme genre, allow that genre to proliferate and run rampant through the schedules. The result is that other kinds of programmes are not placed, simply because of a lack of space. Do we really require so many gardening programmes, make-over programmes or celebrity chefs? Is it not a scandal in this day and age, that there seems to be no place for continuing series of programmes about science or serious music or thoughtful in-depth interviews with people other than politicians? 
In 2009 Attenborough commented on the general state of British television, describing the newly introduced product placement on commercial television as something he considered an "appalling" idea 20 years earlier:
 I think it's in great trouble. The whole system on which it was built — a limited number of networks, with adequate funding — is under threat. That funding is no longer there. As stations proliferate, so audiences are reduced. The struggle for audiences becomes ever greater, while money diminishes. I think that's a fair recipe for trouble. Inevitably, this has an impact on the BBC ... Fortunately, the BBC doesn't think natural history programmes must compete with Strictly Come Dancing in terms of audience. The BBC says, 'Make proper, responsible natural history programmes.'[tpl]Cite news| url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6261612/David-Attenborough-says-TV-is-in-Big-Trouble.html | title= David Attenborough says TV is in 'Big Trouble' | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | date=5 October 2009 | accessdate=28 March 2010 | first=Urmee | last=Khan[/tpl] 

==Filmography==

David Attenborough's television credits span seven decades and his association with natural history programmes dates back to The Pattern of Animals and Zoo Quest in the early 1950s. His most influential work, 1979's Life on Earth, launched a strand of nine authored documentaries with the BBC Natural History Unit which shared the Life moniker and spanned 30 years. He narrated every episode of the long-running BBC series Wildlife on One and in his later career has voiced several high-profile BBC wildlife documentaries, among them The Blue Planet and Planet Earth. He became a pioneer in the 3D documentary format with Flying Monsters in 2010.

==Books==

David Attenborough's work as an author has strong parallels with his broadcasting career. In the 1950s and 1960s his published work included accounts of his animal collecting expeditions around the world, which became the Zoo Quest series. He wrote an accompanying volume to each of his nine Life documentaries, along with books on tribal art and birds of paradise. His autobiography, Life on Air, was published in 2002, revised in 2009 and is one of a number of his works which is available as a self-narrated audiobook. Attenborough has also contributed forewords and introductions to many other works, notably those accompanying Planet Earth, Frozen Planet, Africa and other BBC series he has narrated.

==Audio recordings==

In addition, Attenborough has recorded some of his own works in audiobook form, including Life on Earth, Zoo Quest for a Dragon and his autobiography Life on Air: Memoirs of a Broadcaster.
