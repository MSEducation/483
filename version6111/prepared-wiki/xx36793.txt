==Dialects==

Today's dialects of Romani are differentiated by the vocabulary accumulated since their departure from Anatolia, as well as through divergent phonemic evolution and grammatical features. Many Roma no longer speak the language or speak various new contact languages from the local language with the addition of Romani vocabulary.
Dialect differentiation began with the dispersal of the Romani from the Balkans around the 14th century and on, and with their settlement in areas across Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Matras|2006|loc=Dialect diversity[/tpl] The two most significant areas of divergence are the southeast (with epicenter of the northern Balkans) and west-central Europe (with epicenter Germany). The central dialects replace s in grammatical paradigms with h. The west-northern dialects append j-, simplify ndř to r, retain n in the nominalizer -ipen/-iben, and lose adjectival past-tense in intransitives (gelo, geli → geljas 'he/she went'). Other isoglosses (esp. demonstratives, 2/3pl perfective concord markers, loan verb markers) motivate the division into Balkan, Vlax, Central, Northeast, and Northwest dialects.
A long-standing common categorisation was a division between the Vlax (from Vlach) from non-Vlax dialects. Vlax are those Roma people who lived many centuries in the territory of Romania in slavery. The main distinction between the two groups is the degree to which their vocabulary is borrowed from Romanian. Bernard Gilliath-Smith first made this distinction, and coined the term Vlax in 1915 in the book The Report on the Gypsy tribes of North East Bulgaria. The Vlax dialect group, now seen as just one of about ten groups (see below), has nevertheless become very widespread geographically.
Matras (2002, 2005) has argued for a theory of geographical classification of Romani dialects, which is based on the diffusion in space of innovations. According to this theory, Early Romani (as spoken in the Byzantine Empire) was brought to western and other parts of Europe through population migrations of Rom in the 14th-15th centuries.
These groups settled in the various European regions during the 16th and 17th centuries, acquiring fluency in a variety of contact languages. Changes emerged then, which spread in wave-like patterns, creating the dialect differences attested today. According to Matras, there were two major centres of innovations: some changes emerged in western Europe (Germany and vicinity), spreading eastwards; other emerged in the Wallachian area, spreading to the west and south. In addition, many regional and local isoglosses formed, creating a complex wave of language boundaries. Matras points to the prothesis of j- in aro > jaro 'egg' and ov > jov 'he' as typical examples of west-to-east diffusion, and of addition of prothetic a- in bijav > abijav as a typical east-to-west spread. His conclusion is that dialect differences formed in situ, and not as a result of different waves of migration.Norbert Boretzky: Kommentierter Dialektatlas des Romani. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2004 p. 18-26
According to this classification, the dialects are split as follows:
editor1-first=Barbara|editor1-last=Schrammel
|editor2-first=Dieter W.|editor2-last=Halwachs
|editor3-first=Gerd|editor3-last=Ambrosch |accessdate=14 September 2013}}[/ref]
SIL Ethnologue has the following classification:
In a series of articles (beginning from 1982), Marcel Courthiade proposed a different kind of classification. He concentrates on the dialectal diversity of Romani in three successive strata of expansion, using the criteria of phonological and grammatical changes. Finding the common linguistic features of the dialects, he presents the historical evolution from the first stratum (the dialects closest to the Anatolian Romani of the 13th century) to the second and third strata. He also names as "pogadialects" (after the Pogadi dialect of Great Britain) those with only a Romani vocabulary grafted into a non-Romani language (normally referred to as Para-Romani).
A table of some dialectal differences:
The first stratum includes the oldest dialects: Mećkari (of Tirana), Kabuʒi (of Korça), Xanduri, Drindari, Erli, Arli, Bugurji, Mahaʒeri (of Pristina), Ursari (Rićhinari), Spoitori (Xoraxane), Karpatichi, Polska Roma, Kaale (from Finland), Sinto-manush, and the so-called Baltic dialects.
In the second there are Ćergari (of Podgorica), Gurbeti, Jambashi, Fichiri, Filipiʒi (of Agia Varvara)
The third comprises the rest of the so-called Gypsy dialects, including Kalderash, Lovari, Machvano.

===Mixed languages===

Some Romanies have developed creole languages or mixed languages (chiefly by retaining Romani lexical items and adopting second language grammatical structures), including:

==Geographic distribution==

Romani is the only Indo-Aryan language spoken almost exclusively in Europe (apart from emigrant populations).
The most concentrated areas of Romani speakers are found in southeastern and central Europe, in particular in Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia. Although there are no reliable figures for the exact number of Romani speakers, it may be the largest minority language of the European Union.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Matras|2005|loc=1.2 Numbers and distribution[/tpl]
The following table shows the distribution of Romani speakers in Europe according to Bakker et al. (2000). The last column shows the percentage of Romani speakers in the Romani population in each country.

==Status==

The language is recognized as a minority language in many countries. At present the only place in the world where Romani is employed as an official language is the Municipality of Shuto Orizari within the administrative borders of the Macedonian capital of Skopje.
The first efforts to publish in Romani were undertaken in the interwar Soviet Union (in Cyrillic) and in communist Yugoslavia.Kamusella, T. Language in Central Europe's History and Politics: From the Rule of cuius regio, eius religio to the National Principle of cuius regio, eius lingua? Journal of Globalization Studies. Volume 2, Number 1, May 2011 http://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/140661/
Some traditional communities have expressed opposition to codifying Romani or having it used in public functions. However, the mainstream trend has been towards standardization.
Different variants of the language are now in the process of being codified in those countries with high Romani populations (for example, Slovakia). There are also some attempts currently aimed at the creation of a unified standard language.
A standardized form of Romani is used in Serbia, and in Serbia's autonomous province of Vojvodina, Romani is one of the officially recognized languages of minorities having its own radio stations and news broadcasts.
In Romania, a country with a sizable Romani minority (3.3% of the total population), there is a unified teaching system of the Romani language for all dialects spoken in the country. This is primarily a result of the work of Gheorghe Sarău, who made Romani textbooks for teaching Romani children in the Romani language. He teaches a purified, mildly prescriptive language, choosing the original Indo-Aryan words and grammatical elements from various dialects. The pronunciation is mostly like that of the dialects from the first stratum. When there are more variants in the dialects, the variant that most closely resembles the oldest forms is chosen, like byav, instead of abyav, abyau, akana instead of akanak, shunav instead of ashunav or ashunau, etc.
An effort is also made to derive new words from the vocabulary already in use, i.e., xuryavno (airplane), vortorin (slide rule), palpaledikhipnasko (retrospectively), pashnavni (adjective). There is an ever-changing set of borrowings from Romanian as well, including such terms as vremea (weather, time), primariya (town hall), frishka (cream), sfïnto (saint, holy). Hindi-based neologisms include bijli (bulb, electricity), misal (example), chitro (drawing, design), lekhipen (writing), while there are also English-based neologisms, like printisarel Romani is now used on the internet, in some local media, and in some countries as a medium of instruction.

==Alphabet==

Historically, Romani was an exclusively unwritten language;[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Matras|2006|loc=Definitions[/tpl] for example, Slovakian Romani's orthography was codified only in 1971.Šebková, Hana; Žlnayová, Edita (1998). Nástin mluvnice slovenské romštiny (pro pedagogické účely). Ústí nad Labem: Pedagogická fakulta Univerzity J. E. Purkyně v Ústí nad Labem: p. 4. ISBN 80-7044-205-0. "U nás k tomu došlo v roce 1971, kdy jazyková komise při tehdy existujícím Svazu Cikánů-Romů (1969 - 1973) přijala závaznou písemnou normu slovenského dialektu romštiny."
The overwhelming majority of academic and non-academic literature produced currently in Romani is written using a Latin-based orthography.[tpl]Wikicite | id= Matras-2002 | reference= Matras, Yaron (2002). Romani: A Linguistic Introduction, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-02330-0.[/tpl]
The proposals to form a unified Romani alphabet and one standard Romani language by either chosing one dialect as a standard, or by merging more dialects together, have not been successful - instead, the trend is towards a model, where each dialect has its own writing system.[ref]
Matras, Yaron. "The Future of Romani: Toward a Policy of Linguistic Pluralism". http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2165.[/ref] Among native speakers, the most common pattern for individual authors to use an orthography based on the writing system of the dominant contact language: thus Romanian in Romania, Hungarian in Hungary and so on.
To demonstrate the differences, the phrase tʃʰib, which means "Romani Language" in all the dialects, can be written as románi szib, románi čib, romani tschib, románi tschiwi, romani tšiw, romeni tšiv, romanitschub, rromani čhib, romani chib, rhomani chib, romaji šjib
Šebková, Hana; Žlnayová, Edita (1998). Nástin mluvnice slovenské romštiny (pro pedagogické účely). Ústí nad Labem: Pedagogická fakulta Univerzity J. E. Purkyně v Ústí nad Labem: p. 5. ISBN 80-7044-205-0. and so on.
A currently observable trend, however, appears to be the adoption of a loosely English-oriented orthography, developed spontaneously by native speakers for use online and through email. Most linguists adhere to a system Hancock calls Pan-Vlax.[tpl]Wikicite | id= Hancock-1995 | reference= Hancock, Ian (1995). A Handbook of Vlax Romani, Columbus: Slavica Publishers. ISBN 0-89357-258-6.[/tpl]
The Pan-Vlax system is as follows:
The use of the above graphemes is relatively stable and universal, taking into account dialectal mergers and so on. However, in certain areas there is somewhat more variation. A typically diverse area is in the representation of sounds not present in most varieties of Romani. For example, the centralised vowel phonemes of several varieties of Vlax and Xaladitka, when they are indicated separately from the non-centralised vowels, can be represented using ə, ъ or ă. Another particularly variant area is the representation of palatalised consonants, which are absent from a number of dialects. Some variant graphemes for [tpl]IPA|/tʲ/[/tpl] include tj, ty, ć, čj and t᾿. Finally, the representation of the phoneme [tpl]IPA|/ɻ/[/tpl] (the reflex of the Sanskrit retroflex series[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]), which in several dialects has been merged with [tpl]IPA|/r/[/tpl], tends to vary between rr, ř and rh, and sometimes even gh, with the first two being the most frequently found variants.
The English-based orthography commonly used in North America is, to a degree, an accommodation of the Pan-Vlax orthography to English-language keyboards, replacing those graphemes with diacritics with digraphs, such as the substitution of ts ch sh zh for c č š ž.
An orthographical standard intended for cross-dialect use was introduced by Marcel Courthiade in 1989Courthiade, Marcel. 1989. La langue Romani (Tsigane): Évolution, standardisation, unification, réforme. In:Language Reform. History and Future, Vol IV, edited by Fodor, I. & Hagège, C. Hamburg: Helmut Buske Verlag. 87-110. and has been adopted by the International Romani Union.Matras, Yaron (1999). Writing Romani: The pragmatics of codification in a stateless language. Applied Linguistics, vol. 20, pp 481-502. However, the IRU standard has yet to find a broad base of support from Romani writers. One reason for the reluctance to adopt this standard, according to Canadian Rom Ronald Lee, is that the proposed orthography contains a number of specialized characters not regularly found on European keyboards, such as θ and ʒ.[tpl]Wikicite | id= Lee-2005 | reference= Lee, Ronald (2005). Learn Romani: Das-dúma Rromanes, Hatfield: University of Hertfordshire Press. ISBN 1-902806-44-1.[/tpl]
The International Standard orthography, uses similar conventions to the Pan-Vlax system outlined above. Several of the differences are simply graphical, such as replacing carons with acute accents, transforming č š ž into ć ś ź. However, its most distinctive feature is the use of "meta-notations", which are intended to cover cross-dialectal phonological variation, particularly in degrees of palatalisation; and morpho-graphs, which are used to represent the morphophonological alternation of case suffixes Whether these endings are to be analysed as postpositions or case endings is still a matter of debate in Romani linguistics. See, for example, Hancock (1995) and Matras (2002) for varying approaches. in different phonological environments.[tpl]Wikicite | id= Matras-1999 | reference= Matras, Yaron (1999). Writing Romani: The pragmatics of codification in a stateless language. Applied Linguistics, vol. 20, pp 481-502.[/tpl] The three "morpho-graphs" are ç, q and θ, which represent the initial phonemes of a number of case suffixes, which are realised [tpl]IPA|/s/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/k/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/t/[/tpl] after a vowel and [tpl]IPA|/ts/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/ɡ/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/d/[/tpl] after a nasal consonant. The three "meta-notations" are ʒ, ŏ and ă, the realisation of which varies by dialect. The latter two, for example, are pronounced [tpl]IPA|/o/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/a/[/tpl] in Lovaricka, but [tpl]IPA|/jo/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ja/[/tpl] in Kalderash.

==Phonology==

The Romani sound system is not highly unusual among European languages. Its most marked features are a three-way contrast between unvoiced, voiced, and aspirated stops: p t k č, b d g dž, and ph th kh čh,[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Matras|2006|loc=The sound system[/tpl] and the presence in some dialects of a second rhotic ř, realized as uvular ʀ, a long trill r:, or retroflex ɽ or ɻ.
The following is the core sound inventory of Romani. Phonemes in parentheses are only found in some dialects:
Eastern and Southeastern European Romani dialects commonly have palatalized consonants, either distinctive or allophonic. Some dialects add the central vowel ə or ɨ. Vowel length is often distinctive in Western European Romani dialects. Loans from contact languages often allow other non-native phonemes.
Conservative dialects of Romani have final stress, with the exception of some unstressed affixes (e.g. the vocative ending, the case endings added on to the accusative noun, and the remoteness tense marker). Central and western European dialects often have shifted stress earlier in the word.
At the end of the word, voiced consonants become voiceless and aspirated ones lose aspiration. However, both are kept written as voiced / aspirated one. Examples:

==Lexicon==

==Morphology, parts of speech==

===Nominals===

Nominals in Romani are nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and numerals. Some sources describe article as a nominal, too.
The indefinite article is often borrowed from the local contact language.

====Types====

General Romani is an unusual language, in having two classes of nominals, based on the historic origin of the word, that have a completely different morphology. The two classes can be called inherited and borrowed, but this article uses names from Matras (2006) [tpl]Harvcoltxt|Matras|2006[/tpl] xenolitic and ikeoclitic. To which of the two classes a word belongs is obvious from its ending.

=====Ikeoclitic=====

The first class is the old, Indian vocabulary (and to some extent Farsi, Armenian and Greek loanwords). The ikeoclitic class can also be divided into two sub-classes, based on the ending.

=====Nominals ending in o/i=====

The ending of words in this sub-class is -o with masculines, -'i with feminines. -'i marks "add suffix and change d, t, n, l before the suffix to ď, ť, ň, ľ".
Examples:

=====Nominals without ending=====

All words in this sub-class have no endings, independent of gender.
Examples:Hübschmannová, Milena (1974). Základy Romštiny

=====Xenolitic=====

The second class are the loanwords from European languages.Matras 2002: p. 73 (Matras adds, that the morphology of the new loanwords is maybe borrowed from Greek.)
The ending of borrowed masculine is -os, -is, -as, -us, the borrowed feminine ends on -a.
Examples, from Slovakian Romani:

====Basics of morphology====

Romani has two grammatical genders (masculine / feminine) and two numbers (singular / plural).
All nominals can be in singular or plural.Hübschmannová 1974: p.4, V 1.3

====Cases====

Nouns are marked for case, the most basic of which are the nominative and accusative case. 
The vocative, nominative and indirect case are a bit "outside" of the case systemŠebková, Žlnayová 1998, p. 52-54 - they are produced with only adding suffixes to the root.
Example: the suffix for singular masculine vocative of ikeoclitic types is -eja.Šebková, Žlnayová 1998, p. 47Hübschmannová 1974 - p. 31, V2,1.
The other five cases are a little different. They are all derived from a "indirect root", that is made a little differently for each type; the indirect root is the same as the accusative case. To this root, every case is adding its own suffix - with disregard to gender or type. These are: -te/-de (locative and prepositional), -ke/-ge (dative), -tar/-dar (ablative), -sa(r) (instrumental and comitative), and -ker-/-ger- (genitive).
Example: The endings for o/i ending nominals are as follows:
Example: the suffix for indirect root for masculine plural for all inherited words is -en,Hübschmannová 1974 - p. 43, V4 the dativ suffix is -ke.Šebková, Žlnayová 1998, p. 76-78Hübschmannová 1974 - p. 60, V7.
There are many declension classes of nouns that decline differently, and show dialectal variation.
Slovakian Romani also uses these nine cases:Šebková, Žlnayová 1998, p. 21
The indirect case is used when a word functions as an attribute before a word,Šebková, Žlnayová 1998, p. 52 and is not considered  a case in some literature.

====Agreement====

Romani shows the typically Indo-Aryan pattern of the genitive agreeing with its head noun.
Example:
Adjectives and the definite article show agreement with the noun they modify.
Example:

===Verbs===

Romani derivations are highly synthetic and partly agglutinative. However, they are also sensitive to recent development - for example, in general, Romani in Slavic countries show an adoption of productive aktionsart morphology.Matras 2002 - pg 117
The core of the verb is the lexical root, verb morphology is suffixed.
The verb stem (including derivation markers) by itself has non-perfective aspect and is present or subjunctive.

====Types====

Similarly to nominals, verbs in Romani belongs to several classes, but unlike nominals, it is not based on historic origin. However, the loaned verbs can be recognized, again, by specific endings, which some argue are Greek origin.

=====Irregular verbs=====

Some words are irregular, like te jel - to be.

=====Class I=====

The next three classes are recognizable by suffix in 3rd person singular.
The first class, called I.,Hübschmannová 1974 - p. 20, V1. have a suffix -el in 3rd person singular.
Examples, in 3 ps. sg:

=====Class II=====

Words in the second category, called II.,Hübschmannová 1974 - p. 20, V1. have a suffix -l in 3rd person singular.
Examples, in 3 ps. sg:

=====Class III=====

All the words in the third class are semantically causative pasivum.Hübschmannová 1974 - p. 57, V4,1.
Examples:Hübschmannová 1974 - p. 54, S.

=====Borrowed verbs=====

Borrowed verbs from other languages are marked with affixes taken from Greek tense/aspect suffixes, including -iz-, -in-, and -is-.

====Morphology====

Romani has three verb persons (it doesn't distinguish between masculine and feminine in either one), it has number, that can be either plural or singular.
Romani tenses are, not exclusively, present tense, future tense, two past tenses (perfect and imperfect), present or past conditional and present imperative.
Depending on the dialect, the suffix -a marks the present, future, or conditional. There are many perfective suffixes, which are determined by root phonology, valency, and semantics: e.g. ker-d- 'did'.
There are two sets of personal conjugation suffixes, one for non-perfective verbs, and another for perfective verbs. The non-perfective personal suffixes, continued from Middle Indo-Aryan, are as follows:
These are slightly different for consonant- and vowel-final roots (e.g. xa-s 'you eat', kam-es 'you want'').
The perfective suffixes, deriving from late Middle Indo-Aryan enclitic pronouns, are as follows:
Verbs may also take a further remoteness suffix -as/-ahi/-ys/-s. With non-perfective verbs this marks the imperfect, habitual, or conditional. With the perfective, this marks the pluperfect or counterfactual.

=====Class I=====

All the persons and numbers of present tense of the word te kerelŠebková, Žlnayová 1998, p. 38
Various tenses of the same word, all in 2nd person singular.

=====Class II=====

All the persons and numbers of present tense of the word te paťal
Various tenses of the word te chal, all in 2nd person singular.

=====Class III=====

All the persons and numbers of present tense of the word te pašľol. Note the added -uv-, which is typical for this group.
Various tenses of the same word, all in 2nd person singular again.

====Valency====

Valency markers are affixed to the verb root either to increase or decrease valency.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Matras|2006|loc=Morphology[/tpl] There is dialectal variation as to which markers are most used; common valency-increasing markers are -av-, -ar-, and -ker, and common valency-decreasing markers are -jov- and -áv-. These may also be used to derive verbs from nouns and adjectives.

==Syntax==

Romani syntax is quite different from most Indo-Aryan languages, and shows more similarity to the Balkan languages.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Matras|2006|loc=Syntax[/tpl]
Šebková and Žlnayová, while describing Slovakian Romani, argues that Romani is a free word order language  and that it allows for theme-rheme structure, similarly to Czech, and that in some Romani dialects in East Slovakia, there is a tendency to put a verb at the end of a sentence.
However, Matras describes it further.Matras 2002 - p. 167-168 According to Matras, in most dialects of Romani, Romani is a VO language, with SVO order in contrastive sentences and verb-subject-object order in thetic sentences. The tendency to put verb on the end in some dialects is the Slavic influence.
Examples, from Slovakian Romani:Hübschmannová, Milena (1974). Základy Romštiny. Praha: Academia Praha: p. 7, par. 1,1.
Clauses are usually finite. Relative clauses, introduced by the relativizer kaj, are postponed. Factual and non-factual complex clauses are distinguished.

==Romani in Modern times==

Romani has lent several words to English such as pal (ultimately from Sanskrit bhrātar "brother"Hoad, TF (ed.) Oxford Concise Dictionary of Etymology (1996) Oxford University Press ISBN 0-19-283098-8) and nark "informant" (from Romani nāk "nose"). Other Romani words in general slang are gadgie (man), shiv or chiv (knife). Urban British slang shows an increasing level of Romani influence,[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] with some words becoming accepted into the lexicon of standard English (for example, chav from an assumed Anglo-Romani word, meaning "small boy", in the majority of dialects). There are efforts to teach and familiarise Vlax - Romani to new generation of Romani so that Romani spoken in different parts of the world are connected through single dialect of Romani. Indian Institute of Romani Studies, Chandigarh published several Romani language lessons through its journal Roma during 1970s.[tpl]cite book|last=Lee|first=Ronald|title=Learn Romani|year=2005|publisher=Univ of Hertfordshire Press|location=Hertfordshire, UK |isbn=9781907396427|page=foreword|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ENqAjucuu4MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=romani&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1KIuU6-nB8Kzrgf1_4Fw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=romani&f=false[/tpl] 
Occasionally loanwords from other Indo-Iranian languages such as Hindi are mistakenly labelled as Romani due to surface similarities (due to a shared root), such as cushy, which is from Hindi (itself a loan from Persian kuš) meaning "excellent, healthy, happy".
