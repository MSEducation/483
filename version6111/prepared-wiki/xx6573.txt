</ref>  Since the foil must exert a [[force]] on the air to change its direction, the air must exert a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on the foil.  In the case of an airplane wing, the wing exerts a downward force on the air and the air exerts an upward force on the wing.
<ref>"Essentially, due to the presence of the wing (its shape and inclination to the incoming flow, the so-called angle of attack), the flow is given a downward deflection, as shown in Fig. 2. It is Newton’s third law at work here, with the flow then exerting a reaction force on the wing in an upward direction, thus generating lift."
