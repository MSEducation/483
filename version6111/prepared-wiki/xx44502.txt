[[Panopticon]]

CATEGORIES: Prisons, Philosophical concepts, Surveillance, Penal imprisonment

The Panopticon is a type of institutional building designed by the English philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham in the late 18th century. The concept of the design is to allow a single watchman to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) inmates of an institution without them being able to tell whether they are being watched or not. Although it is physically impossible for the single watchman to observe all cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that all inmates must act as though they are watched at all times, effectively controlling their own behaviour constantly. The name is also a reference to Panoptes from Greek mythology; he was a giant with a hundred eyes and thus was known to be a very effective watchman.
The design consists of a circular structure with an “inspection house” at its centre, from which the manager or staff of the institution are able to watch the inmates, who are stationed around the perimeter. Bentham conceived the basic plan as being equally applicable to hospitals, schools, sanatoriums, daycares, and asylums, but he devoted most of his efforts to developing a design for a Panopticon prison, and it is his prison which is most widely understood by the term.
Bentham himself described the Panopticon as “a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example.”Bentham, Jeremy. Panopticon (Preface). In Božovič 1995, pp. 29–95. Elsewhere, he described the Panopticon prison as “a mill for grinding rogues honest”.Semple 1993, p. 152.

==Conceptual history==

In 1786 and 1787, Bentham travelled to Krichev in White Russia (modern Belarus) to visit his brother, Samuel, who was engaged in managing various industrial and other projects for Prince Potemkin. It was Samuel (as Jeremy later repeatedly acknowledged) who conceived the basic idea of a circular building at the hub of a larger compound as a means of allowing a small number of managers to oversee the activities of a large and unskilled workforce.Semple 1993, pp. 99–100.[tpl]citation|title=Prisons and prison systems: a global encyclopedia|author=Mitchel P. Roth|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RTH31DgbTzgC&pg=PA33|page=33[/tpl] Jeremy began to develop this model, particularly as applicable to prisons, and outlined his ideas in a series of letters sent home to his father in England.Semple 1993, pp. 99–101. He supplemented the supervisory principle with the idea of contract management; that is, an administration by contract as opposed to trust, where the director would have a pecuniary interest in lowering the average rate of mortality.Semple 1993, pp. 134–40.
The Panopticon was intended to be cheaper than the prisons of his time, as it required fewer staff; “Allow me to construct a prison on this model,” Bentham requested to a Committee for the Reform of Criminal Law, “I will be the gaoler. You will see ... that the gaoler will have no salary—will cost nothing to the nation.” As the watchmen cannot be seen, they need not be on duty at all times, effectively leaving the watching to the watched.  According to Bentham's design, the prisoners would also be used as menial labour walking on wheels to spin looms or run a water wheel.  This would decrease the cost of the prison and give a possible source of income.In Božovič 1995, pp. 29–95.

==The abortive Panopticon prison project==

On his return to England from Russia, Bentham continued to work on the idea of a Panopticon prison, and commissioned drawings from an architect, Willey Reveley.Semple 1993, p. 118. In 1791, he published the material he had written as a book, although he continued to refine his proposals for many years to come. He had by now decided that he wanted to see the prison built: when finished, it would be managed by himself as contractor–governor, with the assistance of Samuel. After unsuccessful attempts to interest the authorities in Ireland and revolutionary France,Semple 1993, pp. 102–4, 107–8. he started trying to persuade the prime minister, William Pitt, to revive an earlier abandoned scheme for a National Penitentiary in England, this time to be built as a Panopticon. He was eventually successful in winning over Pitt and his advisors, and in 1794 was paid £2000 for preliminary work on the project.Semple 1993, pp. 108–10, 262.
The intended site was that authorized (under an act of 1779) for the earlier Penitentiary, at Battersea Rise; but the new proposals ran into technical legal problems and objections from the local landowner, Earl Spencer.Semple 1993, pp. 169–89. Other sites were considered, including one at Hanging Wood, near Woolwich, but all proved unsatisfactory.Semple 1993, pp. 194–7. Eventually Bentham turned to a site at Tothill Fields, near Westminster. Although this was common land, with no landowner, there were a number of parties with interests in it, including Earl Grosvenor, who owned a house on an adjacent site and objected to the idea of a prison overlooking it. Again, therefore, the scheme ground to a halt.Semple 1993, pp. 197–217. At this point, however, it became clear that a nearby site at Millbank, adjoining the Thames, was available for sale, and this time things ran more smoothly. Using government money, Bentham bought the land on behalf of the Crown for £12,000 in November 1799.Semple 1993, pp. 217–22.
From his point of view, the site was far from ideal, being marshy, unhealthy, and too small. When he asked the government for more land and more money, however, the response was that he should build only a small-scale experimental prison—which he interpreted as meaning that there was little real commitment to the concept of the Panopticon as a cornerstone of penal reform.Semple 1993, pp. 226–31.  Negotiations continued, but in 1801 Pitt resigned from office, and in 1803 the new Addington administration decided not to proceed with the project.Semple 1993, pp. 236–9. Bentham was devastated: “They have murdered my best days.”Quoted in Semple 1993, p. 244.
Nevertheless, a few years later the government revived the idea of a National Penitentiary, and in 1811 and 1812 returned specifically to the idea of a Panopticon.Semple 1993, pp. 265–79. Bentham, now aged 63, was still willing to be governor. However, as it became clear that there was still no real commitment to the proposal, he abandoned hope, and instead turned his attentions to extracting financial compensation for his years of fruitless effort. His initial claim was for the enormous sum of nearly £700,000, but he eventually settled for the more modest (but still considerable) sum of £23,000.Semple 1993, pp. 279–81. An Act of Parliament in 1812 transferred his title in the site to the Crown.Penitentiary House, etc. Act: 52 Geo. III, c. 44 (1812).
Bentham remained bitter about the rejection of the Panopticon scheme throughout his later life, convinced that it had been thwarted by the King and an aristocratic elite. It was largely because of his sense of injustice that he developed his ideas of “sinister interest”—that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest—which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform.[tpl]cite book |first=Philip |last=Schofield |title=Bentham: a guide for the perplexed |year=2009 |place=London |publisher=Continuum |ISBN=978-0-8264-9589-1 |pages=90–93 [/tpl]
The National Penitentiary was indeed subsequently built on the Millbank site, but to a design by William Williams that owed little to the Panopticon, beyond the fact that the governor's quarters, administrative offices, and chapel were placed at the centre of the complex. It opened in 1816.

==Panopticon prison designs==

[tpl]quote|text= The architecture incorporates a tower central to a circular building that is divided into cells, each cell extending the entire thickness of the building to allow inner and outer windows. The occupants of the cells are thus backlit, isolated from one another by walls, and subject to scrutiny both collectively and individually by an observer in the tower who remains unseen. Toward this end, Bentham envisioned not only venetian blinds on the tower observation ports but also maze-like connections among tower rooms to avoid glints of light or noise that might betray the presence of an observer. |sign=Ben and Marthalee Barton, 1993[tpl] cite journal |last1=Barton |first1=Ben F. |first2=Marthalee S. |last2=Barton |title=Modes of Power in Technical and Professional Visuals |journal=Journal of Business and Technical Communication |volume=7 |issue=1 |year=1993 |pages=138–62 |doi=10.1177/1050651993007001007[/tpl][/tpl]
No true Panopticon prisons to Bentham's designs have ever been built[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]. The closest are the buildings of the now abandoned Presidio Modelo in Cuba (constructed 1926–28). Although most prison designs have included elements of surveillance, the essential elements of Bentham's design were not only that the custodians should be able to view the prisoners at all times (including times when they were in their cells), but also that the prisoners should be unable to see the custodians, and so could never be sure whether or not they were under surveillance.
This objective was extremely difficult to achieve within the constraints of the available technology, which is why Bentham spent so many years reworking his plans. Subsequent 19th-century prison designs enabled the custodians to keep the doors of cells and the outsides of buildings under observation, but not to see the prisoners in their cells. Something close to a realization of Bentham's vision only became possible through 20th-century technological developments—notably closed-circuit television (CCTV)—but these eliminated the need for a specific architectural framework.
It has been argued that the Panopticon influenced the radial design of 19th-century prisons built on the principles of the "separate system" (including Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, opened in 1829, and the later Pentonville Prison in London and Armagh Gaol in Northern Ireland).[tpl]cite book |last=Andrzejewski |first=Anna Vemer |title=Building Power: Architecture and Surveillance in Victorian America |place=Knoxville |publisher=University of Tennessee Press |year=2008 |ISBN=9781572336315 |pages=18–19 [/tpl] In these prisons control was exercised through strict prisoner isolation rather than surveillance, but they also incorporated a design of radiating wings, allowing a centrally located guard to observe the door of every cell.

===Prisons for which a “Panoptic” influence has been claimed===

As noted above, none of these prisons—with the arguable exception of the Presidio Modelo—are true Panopticons in the Benthamic sense. In some cases, the claims for any influence are very dubious indeed, and seem to be based on little more than the fact that (for example) the design is circular.

==The Information Panopticon==

The Information Panopticon (also referred to as the Virtual or Electronic Panopticon) also ties in with Jeremy Bentham’s idea, used as a metaphor by writer Shoshana Zuboff.  With this idea, they do not need a building set up in a certain way, or personnel constantly patrolling the area.  In this case, ICTs are the tools that are used to control certain subjects and their information.  It is more complicated for these subjects to remain anonymous.  This is how managers can keep track of worker behavior, through technological systems that the manager maintains authority over, rather than face-to-face.  Because of this change, rather than evaluating the workers themselves, the managers are evaluating their actual work, or objective data.  The workers also can focus more on performance rather than the people around them.  They do not need to worry as much about their relationships and interactions with one another.  Managers no longer have to utilize their interpersonal skills the way they would face-to-face.  Workers will never know whether or not they are being watched, pressuring them to be on their best behavior at all times or complete their tasks in a timely manner or with high quality work.
The question of whether or not this sort of surveillance would be taken for granted is something that has been analyzed by historians such as Michel Foucault.  Zuboff describes some of these behaviors as “the secret comfort of the one-way mirror, the yearning for omniscience in the fact of uncertainty, the conformity-inducing power of involuntary display.”  A difference between this and Bentham’s Panopticon is that this has a hierarchal structure.  Each position in the organization is likely to be watched by someone of more authority.   For example, while workers may be watched by their managers, those managers could be watched by the company’s executives, who have to respond to the vice president or someone of higher power.  If something goes wrong in the workplace, it seems that those with higher power are more likely to be held liable for what has happened.
Managers are able to keep this sort of power over their workers by being more knowledgeable about these systems.  This is how they are able to keep such information at a distance from workers.  There is the constant question of how much power these individuals should have over the information of the workers.  To what extent should they be allowed to observe workers?

==Other panoptic structures==

Bentham always conceived the Panopticon principle as being beneficial to the design of a variety of institutions where surveillance was important, including hospitals, schools, workhouses, and lunatic asylums, as well as prisons. In particular, he developed it in his ideas for a "chrestomathic" school (one devoted to useful learning), in which teaching was to be undertaken by senior pupils on the monitorial principle, under the overall supervision of the Master;M.J. Smith and W.H. Burston (eds), Chrestomathia, Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham (Oxford, 1983), pp. 106, 108–9, 124. and for a pauper “industry-house” (workhouse).M. Quinn (ed.), Writings on the Poor Laws: Volume II, Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham (Oxford, 2010), pp. 98–9, 105–6, 112–3, 352–3, 502–3.C.F. Bahmueller, The National Charity Company: Jeremy Bentham's Silent Revolution (Berkeley, 1981).
A wooden Panopticon factory, capable of holding 5000 workers, was constructed by Samuel Bentham in Saint Petersburg, on the banks of the Neva River, between 1805 and 1808: its purpose was to educate and employ young men in trades connected with the navy. It burned down in 1818.Semple 1993, pp. 214–5.
The Round Mill in Belper, Derbyshire, England, is supposed to have been built on the Panopticon principle with a central overseer. Designed by William Strutt, and constructed in 1811, it had fallen into disuse by the beginning of the 20th century and was demolished in 1959.[tpl]cite book |last=Farmer |first=Adrian |title=Belper and Milford |publisher=Tempus |place=Stroud |year=2004 |page=119 [/tpl]
The Worcester State Hospital, constructed in the late 19th century, extensively employed panoptic structures to allow more efficient observation of the wards. It was considered a model facility at the time.
The Panopticon has been suggested as an "open" hospital architecture:

==Criticism and the Panopticon as A Metaphor==

Despite the fact that no Panopticon was built during Bentham's lifetime (and virtually none since), his concept has prompted considerable discussion and debate. Whereas Bentham himself regarded the Panopticon as a rational and enlightened, and therefore just, solution to societal problems, his ideas have been repeatedly criticised by others for their reductive, mechanistic and inhumane approach to human lives. Thus, in 1841, Augustus Pugin published the second edition of his work, Contrasts, in which one plate showed a "Modern Poorhouse" (clearly modelled on a Panopticon), a bleak and comfortless structure in which the pauper is separated from his family, subjected to a harsh discipline, fed on a minimal diet, and consigned after death to medical dissection, contrasted with an "Antient Poor House", an architecturally inspiring religious institution in which the pauper is treated throughout with humanity and dignity.[tpl]cite book |first=Margaret |last=Belcher |chapter=Pugin Writing |editor1-first=Paul |editor1-last=Atterbury |editor2-first=Clive |editor2-last=Wainwright |title=Pugin: a Gothic Passion |publisher=Yale University Press |place=London |year=1994 |ISBN=0300060122 |pages=105–116 (108–9) [/tpl] In 1965, American historian Gertrude Himmelfarb published an essay, "The Haunted House of Jeremy Bentham", in which she depicted Bentham's mechanism of surveillance as a tool of oppression and social control.[tpl]cite book |first=Gertrude |last=Himmelfarb |authorlink=Gertrude Himmelfarb |chapter=The Haunted House of Jeremy Bentham |editor1-first=Richard |editor1-last=Herr |editor2-first=Harold T. |editor2-last=Parker |title=Ideas in History: essays presented to Louis Gottschalk by his former students |publisher=Duke University Press |place=Durham, N.C. |year=1965 [/tpl] Parallel arguments were put forward by French psychoanalyst Jacques-Alain Miller in an essay entitled "Le despotisme de l'utile: la machine panoptique de Jeremy Bentham", written in 1973 and published in 1975.[tpl]cite journal |first=Jacques-Alain |last=Miller |authorlink=Jacques-Alain Miller |title=La despotisme de l'utile: la machine panoptique de Jeremy Bentham |journal=Ornicar? |volume=3 |year=1975 |pages=3–36 [/tpl]; published in English as [tpl]cite journal |first=Jacques-Alain |last=Miller |authorlink=Jacques-Alain Miller |title=Jeremy Bentham's Panoptic Device |journal=October |volume=41 |year=1987[/tpl].

Most influentially, the idea of the panopticon was invoked by Michel Foucault, in his Discipline and Punish (1975), as a metaphor for modern "disciplinary" societies and their pervasive inclination to observe and normalise. "On the whole, therefore, one can speak of the formation of a disciplinary society in this movement that stretches from the enclosed disciplines, a sort of social 'quarantine', to an indefinitely generalizable mechanism of 'panopticism'".Foucault 1995, pp. 195–210: quotation at p. 216. The Panopticon is an ideal architectural figure of modern disciplinary power. The Panopticon creates a consciousness of permanent visibility as a form of power, where no bars, chains, and heavy locks are necessary for domination any more.Thomas Allmer (2012), Towards a Critical Theory of Surveillance in Informational Capitalism, Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, p. 22. Foucault proposes that not only prisons but all hierarchical structures like the army,  schools, hospitals and factories have evolved through history to resemble Bentham's Panopticon. The notoriety of the design today (although not its lasting influence in architectural realities) stems from Foucault's famous analysis of it.
Building on Foucault, contemporary social critics often assert that technology has allowed for the deployment of panoptic structures invisibly throughout society. Surveillance by CCTV cameras in public spaces is an example of a technology that brings the gaze of a superior into the daily lives of the populace. Furthermore, a number of cities in the United Kingdom, including Middlesbrough, Bristol, Brighton and London have added loudspeakers to a number of their existing CCTV cameras. They can transmit the voice of a camera supervisor to issue audible messages to the public.Cameras Help Stop Crime The Hoya, 22 September 20062006, But Has 1984 Finally Arrived? Indymedia UK, 19 September 2006 Similarly, critical analyses of internet practice have suggested that the internet allows for a panoptic form of observation.The New Panopticon:  The Internet Viewed as a Structure of Social Control ISPs are able to track users' activities, while user-generated content means that daily social activity may be recorded and broadcast online.[tpl]cite web| url=http://mobimundi.net| title=WORKSHOP: Exploring the Impact of User-generated Mobile Content – The Participatory Panopticon| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120311061007/http://mobimundi.net/| deadurl=yes| archivedate=11 March 2012| accessdate=25 January 2013[/tpl]
Shoshana Zuboff used the metaphor of the panopticon in her book In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power (1988) to describe how computer technology makes work more visible. Zuboff examined how computer systems were used to track the behavior and output of workers. She used the term panopticon because the workers could not tell that they were being spied on, while the manager was able to check their work continuously. As the book was written in 1988, Zuboff's arguments were based on Dialog rather than the World Wide Web. Shoshana Zuboff argues that there is a collective responsibility formed by the hierarchy in the Information Panopticon that eliminates subjective opinions and judgements of managers on their employees. She argued that because each employee’s contribution to the production process is translated into objective data, it becomes more important for managers to be able to analyze the work rather than analyze the people.[tpl]citation|title= In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power |author=Shoshana Zuboff |year=1988|publisher=New York: Basic Books |url=https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/pluginfile.php/227065/mod_resource/content/1/zuboff_info_panopticon.pdf|pages=315–361[/tpl]
Like a physical Panopticon prison, some Information Communication Technologies (ICT’s) can make individuals feel as though they are being watched at all times. This can occur at home when a user is on the internet and feels that nothing they do on the internet is private. It is as though they are inmates in a Panopticon, forced to be on their best behavior at all times because of the ambiguity of observation. One never knows who is seeing what they post on the internet, and therefore has to monitor their posts constantly.
In 1991 Mohammad Kowsar used the metaphor in the title of his book “The Critical Panopticon: Essays in the Theatre and Contemporary Aesthetics” (American University Studies Series Xxvi Theatre Arts). Derrick Jensen and Gerge Draffan's 2004 book Welcome to the Machine: Science, Surveillance, and the Culture of Control seeks to demonstrate how our society, by techniques like the use of biometric passports to identity chips in consumer goods, from nanoparticle weapons to body-enhancing and mind-altering drugs for soldiers, is being pushed towards a panopticon-like state.
The panopticon has also become a symbol of the extreme measures that some companies take in the name of efficiency as well as to guard against employee theft, documented in a 2009 paper by Max Haiven and Scott Stoneman entitled, Wal-Mart: The Panopticon of TimeHaiven, Max and Stoneman, Scott (2009) Wal-Mart: The Panopticon of Time, pp. 3-7. and the 2014 book by Simon Head, Mindless: Why Smarter Machines Are Making Dumber Humans[tpl]cite book |first=Simon |last=Head |authorlink=Simon Head |chapter=Walmart and Amazon |editor1-first=Tim |editor1-last=Bartlett |title=Mindless: Why Smarter Machines Makes Dumber Humans |publisher=Basic Books |place=New York, N.Y. |year=2014 |ISBN=0465018440 [/tpl] that describes conditions at an Amazon.com depot in Augsburg, Germany. Both argue that catering at all times to the desires of the customer can lead to increasingly oppressive corporate environments and quotas in which many warehouse workers can no longer keep up with demands of management.
