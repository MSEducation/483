The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is an American twin-engine, tandem rotor heavy-lift helicopter.  Its primary roles are troop movement, artillery placement and battlefield resupply.  It has a wide loading ramp at the rear of the fuselage and three external-cargo hooks.  With a top speed of 170 knots (196 mph, 315 km/h) the helicopter is faster than contemporary utility and attack helicopters of the 1960s. The CH-47 is among the heaviest lifting Western helicopters.  Its name is from the Native American Chinook people.
The Chinook was designed and initially produced by Boeing Vertol in the early 1960s; it is now produced by Boeing Rotorcraft Systems.  It is one of the few aircraft of that era – along with the fixed-wing Lockheed C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft – that remain in production and frontline service, with over 1,200 built to date. The helicopter has been sold to 16 nations with the U.S. Army and the Royal Air Force (see Boeing Chinook (UK variants)) being its largest users.  The U.S. Army plans to operate the CH-47 Chinook until 2038.Boeing to deliver 28 Chinooks to US Army - Flightglobal.com, 26 December 2013

==Design and development==

===Early development===

In late 1956, the United States Department of the Army announced plans to replace the Sikorsky CH-37 Mojave, which was powered by piston engines, with a new, turbine-powered helicopter.[tpl]cite book |url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/vietnam/airmobility/airmobility-fm.html |title = Vietnam Studies: Airmobility 1961–71 |work=Department of the Army |author=Leuutenant General John J. Tolson |year = 1989 |publisher=US Government Printing Office| id = CMH Pub 90-4[/tpl] Turbine engines were also a key design feature of the smaller UH-1 "Huey" utility helicopter. Following a design competition, in September 1958, a joint Army–Air Force source selection board recommended that the Army procure the Vertol medium transport helicopter.  However, funding for full-scale development was not then available, and the Army vacillated on its design requirements.  Some in the Army aviation corps thought that the new helicopter should be a light tactical transport aimed at taking over the missions of the old piston-engined H-21 and H-34 helicopters, and be consequently capable of carrying about fifteen troops (one squad).  Another faction in the Army aviation corps thought that the new helicopter should be much larger to be able to airlift a large artillery piece, and have enough internal space to carry the new MGM-31 "Pershing" Missile System.
Vertol began work on a new tandem-rotor helicopter designated Vertol Model 107 or V-107 in 1957.Apostolo, Giorgio. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Helicopters. New York: Bonanza Books. 1984. ISBN 978-0-517-43935-7.Goebel, Greg. Origins: Vertol V-107 & V-114. Vectorsite.net, 1 December 2009. In June 1958, the U.S. Army awarded a contract to Vertol for the aircraft under the YHC-1A designation.Spenser, Jay P. Whirlybirds, A History of the U.S. Helicopter Pioneers. University of Washington Press, 1998. ISBN 0-295-97699-3. The YHC-1A had a capacity for 20 troops. Three were tested by the Army for deriving engineering and operational data. However, the YHC-1A was considered by most of the Army users to be too heavy for the assault role and too light for the transport role. The decision was made to procure a heavier transport helicopter and at the same time upgrade the UH-1 "Huey" as a tactical troop transport. The YHC-1A would be improved and adopted by the Marines as the CH-46 Sea Knight in 1962.[tpl]cite news |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/454317782.html?dids=454317782:454317782&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+26%2C+1962&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=The+Quiet+Americans--Our+Marines+Overseas&pqatl=google |title = The Quiet Americans-Our Marines Overseas |first = Alexander |last = Holmes |work=Los Angeles Times |date = 26 October 1962[/tpl] The Army then ordered the larger Model 114 under the designation HC-1B.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/04/01/222553/chinook-five-decades-of-development.html |title = Chinook: Five decades of development |first = Graham |last = Warwick |work=Flight International |date = 1 April 2008[/tpl] The pre-production Boeing Vertol YCH-1B made its initial hovering flight on 21 September 1961. In 1962 the HC-1B was redesignated the CH-47A under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system.  It was named "Chinook", which alludes to the Chinook people of the Pacific Northwest.
The CH-47 is powered by two turboshaft engines, mounted on each side of the helicopter's rear pedestal and connected to the rotors by driveshafts. Initial models were fitted with Lycoming T-53 jet engines with a combined rating of 2,200 shaft horsepower. Subsequent versions of the Chinook were configured with improved Lycoming engines and later with General Electric turbines. The counter-rotating rotors eliminate the need for an anti-torque vertical rotor, allowing all power to be used for lift and thrust. The ability to adjust lift in either rotor makes it less sensitive to changes in the center of gravity, important for the cargo lifting role. If one engine fails, the other can drive both rotors.Chinook Information and diagrams about the transmission system The "sizing" of the Chinook was directly related to the growth of the Huey and the Army's tacticians' insistence that initial air assaults be built around the squad. The Army pushed for both the Huey and the Chinook, and this focus was responsible for the acceleration of its air mobility effort.

===Improved and later versions===

Improved and more powerful versions of the CH-47 have been developed since the helicopter entered service. The U.S. Army's first major design leap was the now-common CH-47D, which entered service in 1982. Improvements from the CH-47C included upgraded engines, composite rotor blades, a redesigned cockpit to reduce pilot workload, improved and redundant electrical systems, an advanced flight control system and improved avionics.[tpl]cite news |url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB293DCB78A3557&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title = This Whirlybird's an early bird: Boeing Vertol's Army copter delivered on budget |first = Tom |last = Belden |publisher=Philadelphia Inquirer |date = 21 May 1982[/tpl] The latest mainstream generation is the CH-47F, which features several major upgrades to reduce maintenance, digitized flight controls, and is powered by two 4,733-horsepower Honeywell engines.[tpl]cite web |url = http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=784 |title = Boeing Receives $1.15B Contract for 15 Canadian Chinooks, Announces Matching Reinvestment in Industry |publisher=Boeing |date = 10 August 2009[/tpl]
A commercial model of the Chinook, the Boeing-Vertol Model 234, is used worldwide for logging, construction, fighting forest fires, and supporting petroleum extraction operations. On 15 December 2006, the Columbia Helicopters company of the Salem, Oregon, metropolitan area, purchased the Type certificate of the Model 234 from Boeing.[tpl]cite web |title = Type Certificate Data Sheet No. H9EA |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |date = 17 January 2007 |url = http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgMakeModel.nsf/0/84EBE8780BF584058625726B00657D0E/$FILE/H9EA.pdf |format = .pdf |accessdate =8 February 2007[/tpl] The Chinook has also been licensed to be built by companies outside the United States, such as Elicotteri Meridionali (now AgustaWestland) in Italy, and Kawasaki in Japan.

==Operational history==

===Vietnam War===

The Army finally settled on the larger Chinook as its standard medium transport helicopter and as of February 1966, 161 aircraft had been delivered to the Army. The 1st Cavalry Division had brought their organic Chinook battalion with them when they arrived in 1965 and a separate aviation medium helicopter company, the 147th, had arrived in Vietnam on 29 November 1965.[tpl]cite news |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40D10FF3C5A157A93C3A81783D85F418685F9 |title = Chinook Copter to Vietnam |work=The New York Times |date = 11 August 1965[/tpl] This latter company was initially placed in direct support of the 1st Infantry Division.
The most spectacular mission in Vietnam for the Chinook was the placing of artillery batteries in perilous mountain positions inaccessible by any other means, and then keeping them resupplied with large quantities of ammunition. The 1st Cavalry Division found that its CH-47s were limited to a [tpl]convert|7000|lb|adj=on[/tpl] payload when operating in the mountains, but could carry an additional [tpl]convert|1000|lb[/tpl] when operating near the coast. The early Chinook design was limited by its rotor system which did not permit full use of the installed power, and users were anxious for an improved version which would upgrade this system.
As with any new piece of equipment, the Chinook presented a major problem of "customer education". Commanders and crew chiefs had to be constantly alert that eager soldiers did not overload the temptingly large cargo compartment. It would be some time before troops would be experts at using sling loads.  The Chinook soon proved to be such an invaluable aircraft for artillery movement and heavy logistics that it was seldom used as an assault troop carrier. Some of the Chinook fleet were used for casualty evacuation, due to the very heavy demand for the helicopters they were usually overburdened with wounded.[tpl]cite journal |url = http://wjn.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/22/5/526 |title = Hardships and Personal Strategies of Vietnam War Nurses |first = Elizabeth A. |last = Scannell-Desch |author2=Marion Anderson |journal=Western Journal of Nursing Research |volume = 22 |number = 5 |pages = 526–550 |year = 2000[/tpl]  Perhaps the most cost effective use of the Chinook was the recovery of other downed aircraft.[tpl]cite book |url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=P-C6dCXJ4zgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA9&dq=Vietnam+Chinook&ots=s2elEs6cj_&sig=IhopePl5z_GtOAQMmc21R55UsTA#v=onepage&q=Chinook&f=false |title = Vietnam choppers: helicopters in battle 1950–75 |first = Simon |last = Dunstan |publisher=Osprey Publishing |year = 2003 |page = 81[/tpl]
The CH-47s are generally armed with a single 7.62-millimeter M60 machine gun on a pintle mount on either side of the machine for self-defense, with stops fitted to keep the gunners from firing into the rotor blades. Dust filters were also added to improve engine reliability. At its peak employment in Vietnam, there were 22 Chinook units in operation. Of the nearly 750 Chinook helicopters in the U.S. and South Vietnam fleets, about 200 were lost in combat or wartime operational accidents.Anderton, David & Miller, Jay – Boeing Helicopters CH-47 Chinook.

===Iran-Iraq War===

During the 1970s, the United States and Iran had a strong relationship, in which the Iranian armed forces began to use many American military aircraft, most notably the F-14 Tomcat, as part of a modernization program.[tpl]cite web |url = http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=2r4bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WFoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4795,3807638&dq=f14+iran&hl=en |title = Oil pact with U.S. firm: Iran signs agreement |first = Murray |last = Marder |publisher=Victoria Advocate |date = 26 July 1973[/tpl] After an agreement signed between Boeing and Elicotteri Meridionali, the Imperial Iranian Air Force purchased 20 Elicotteri Meridionali-built CH-47Cs in 1971.[tpl]cite news |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00A13FF3455127B93C7AB178CD85F458785F9 |title = U.S., Britain Quietly Back Military Build-Up of Iran |first = Tad |last = Szulcs |work=The New York Times |date = 25 July 1971[/tpl] The Imperial Iranian Army Aviation purchased 70 CH-47Cs from Elicotteri Meridionali during the period of 1972–1976.

In the 1978 Iranian Chinook shootdown, four Iranian CH-47Cs penetrated 15–20 km into Soviet airspace in the Turkmenistan Military District. They were intercepted by a MiG-23M which shot down one Chinook, killing eight crew members, and forced a second one to land. Chinook helicopters were used in efforts by the Imperial Iranian loyalist forces to resist the 1979 Iranian revolution.[tpl]cite web |url= http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=zbMwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-PoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4025,4705243&dq=iran+orders+chinook&hl=en |title= Iranian troops smash four-day siege by Kurds |publisher=Lakeland Ledger |date = 27 August 1979[/tpl] 
During the war with Iraq, Iran made heavy use of its US-bought equipment, and lost at least 8 CH-47s during the 1980–1988 period; most notably during a clash on 15 July 1983, where an Iraqi Mirage F-1 destroyed three Iranian CH-47s transporting troops to the front line, and on 25–26 February 1984, when Iraqi MiG-21 fighters shot down two Chinooks.Iraqi Air-to-Air Victories since 1967

===Afghanistan and Iraq wars===

Approximately 163 CH-47Ds of various operators were deployed to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq during Operation Desert Shield and the subsequent Operation Desert Storm in 1990–91.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.army-technology.com/projects/chinook/|title=CH-47D/MH-47E Chinook|work=Army Technology|accessdate=27 August 2006|year= 2006|publisher=SPG Media Limited[/tpl]
The CH-47D has seen wide use in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. The Chinook is being used in air assault missions, inserting troops into fire bases and later bringing food, water, and ammunition. It is also the casualty evacuation (casevac) aircraft of choice in the British Armed Forces.[tpl]cite news |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/60610400.html?dids=60610400:60610400&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+12%2C+2000&author=&pub=The+Herald&desc=Paras+tell+of+their+fear+under+fire%3B+'It+was+scary+but+once+we+got+into+the+fighting%2C+the+training+took+over'&pqatl=google |title = Paras tell of their fear under fire |work=The Herald |date = 12 September 2000[/tpl] In combat theaters, it is typically escorted by attack helicopters such as the AH-64 Apache for protection.[tpl]cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/367078.stm |title = UK leads Nato into Kosovo |publisher=BBC News |date = 12 June 1999[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url = http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16627753&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=scots-set-for-taliban-hotspots--name_page.html |title = Scots set for Taliban Hotspots |first = Pippa |last = Crerar |work=Daily Record |date = 26 January 2006[/tpl] Its lift capacity has been found of particular value in the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan where high altitudes and temperatures limit the use of helicopters such as UH-60 Black Hawk; reportedly, one Chinook can replace up to five UH-60s in the air assault transport role.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htairmo/20080305.aspx |title = Chinook Replaces Blackhawk in Combat |publisher=Air Transportation |date = 5 March 2008[/tpl]
The Chinook helicopters of several nations have participated in the Afghanistan War, including aircraft from Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Canada, and Australia. Despite the age of the Chinook, it is still in heavy demand, in part due its proven versatility and ability to operate in demanding environments such as Afghanistan."Boeing Receives $1.15B Contract for 15 Canadian Chinooks, Announces Matching Reinvestment in Industry".

===Disaster relief and other roles===

Since the type's inception, the Chinook has carried out secondary missions including medical evacuation, disaster relief, search and rescue, aircraft recovery, fire fighting, and heavy construction assistance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/rotorcraft/military/ch47d/index.htm|title=CH-47D/F Chinook page|publisher=Boeing[/tpl] According to Suresh Abraham, the Chinook's ability to carry large underslung loads has been of significant value in relief operations in the aftermath of natural disasters.Abraham, Suresh. "Tactical Transport Helicopters in Humanitarian Relief Operations." ADJ, April 2009. Chinooks operators have often deployed their fleets overseas to support humanitarian efforts in stricken nations; Chinooks of the Republic of Singapore Air Force assisted in relief operations in neighboring Indonesia following the 2004 Asian Tsumani, and after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake the Royal Air Force dispatched Chinooks to Northern Pakistan to assist in recovery efforts.

==Variants==

===HC-1B===

The pre-1962 designation for Model 114 development aircraft that would be re-designated CH-47 Chinook.

===CH-47A===

The all-weather, medium-lift CH-47A Chinook was powered initially by Lycoming T55-L-5 engines rated at [tpl]convert|2200|hp|kW|sigfig=3|lk=in[/tpl] but then replaced by the T55-L-7 rated at [tpl]convert|2650|hp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on[/tpl] engines or T55-L-7C engines rated at [tpl]convert|2850|hp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on[/tpl]. The CH-47A had a maximum gross weight of [tpl]convert|33000|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. allowing for a maximum payload of approximately [tpl]convert|10000|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]http://www.airforceworld.com/heli/eng/ch47.htm Initial delivery of the CH-47A Chinook to the U.S. Army was in August 1962. A total of 349 were built.

===ACH-47A===

The ACH-47A was originally known as the Armed/Armored CH-47A (or A/ACH-47A). It was officially designated ACH-47A by U.S. Army Attack Cargo Helicopter and unofficially Guns A Go-Go. Four CH-47A helicopters were converted to gunships by Boeing Vertol in late 1965. Three were assigned to the 53rd Aviation Detachment in South Vietnam for testing, with the remaining one retained in the U.S. for weapons testing. By 1966, the 53rd was redesignated the 1st Aviation Detachment (Provisional) and attached to the 228th Assault Support Helicopter Battalion of the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). By 1968, only one gunship remained, and logistical concerns prevented more conversions. It was returned to the United States, and the program stopped.
The ACH-47A carried five M60D 7.62 × 51 mm machine guns or M2HB .50 caliber machine guns, provided by the XM32 and XM33 armament subsystems, two M24A1 20 mm cannons, two XM159B/XM159C 19-Tube [tpl]convert|2.75|in|adj=on[/tpl] rocket launchers or sometimes two M18/M18A1 7.62 × 51 mm gun pods, and a single M75 40 mm grenade launcher in the XM5/M5 armament subsystem (more commonly seen on the UH-1 series of helicopters). The surviving aircraft, Easy Money, has been restored and is on display at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.Guns a Go-Go. chinook-helicopter.com

===CH-47B===

The CH-47B was an interim solution while Boeing worked on a more substantially improved CH-47C. The CH-47B was powered by two Lycoming T55-L-7C 2,850 shp (2,130 kW) engines. It featured a blunted rear rotor pylon, redesigned asymmetrical rotor blades, and strakes along the rear ramp and fuselage to improve flying characteristics. It could be equipped with two door-mounted M60D 7.62 mm NATO machine guns on the M24 armament subsystem and a ramp-mounted M60D using the M41 armament subsystem. Some CH-47 "bombers" were equipped to drop tear gas or napalm from the rear cargo ramp onto NLF (aka Việt Cộng) bunkers. The CH-47 could be equipped with a hoist and cargo hook. The Chinook proved especially valuable in "Pipe Smoke" aircraft recovery missions. The "Hook" recovered about 12,000 aircraft valued at over $3.6 billion during the war. 108 were built.

===CH-47C===

The CH-47C featured more powerful engines and transmissions.US Army CH-47A / CH-47B / CH-47C / CH-47D / SOA Chinooks. Vectorsite.net, 1 July 2004. Three versions of the "C model" were built. The first had Lycoming T55-L-7C engines delivering [tpl]convert|2850|shp|abbr=on[/tpl]. The "Super C" included Lycoming T55-L-11 engines delivering [tpl]convert|3750|shp|abbr=on[/tpl], an upgraded maximum gross weight of [tpl]convert|46000|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and a pitch stability augmentation system (PSAS). Due to difficulties with the T55-L-11 engines, which were hurriedly introduced to increase payload, they were temporarily removed and the reliable Lycoming T55-L-7C's were installed. The type was distinguishable from the standard "C" by the uprated maximum gross weight.
The type was unable to receive FAA certification to engage in civil activities due to the non-redundant hydraulic flight boost system drive. A redesign of the hydraulic boost system drive was incorporated in the succeeding CH-47D, allowing that model to achieve certification as the Boeing Model 234. A total of 233 CH-47Cs were built. Canada bought a total of eight CH-47Cs, deliveries of the type began in 1974. Receiving the Canadian designation "CH-147", these were fitted with a power hoist above the crew door, other changes included a flight engineer station in the rear cabin, Boeing referred to the configuration as the "Super C".[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] The CH-47C saw wide use during the Vietnam war, eventually replacing the older H-21 Shawnee in the combat assault support role.

===CH-47D===

The CH-47D shares the same airframe as earlier models, the main difference being the adoption of more powerful engines. Early CH-47Ds were originally powered by two T55-L-712 engines, the most common engine is the later T55-GA-714A. With its triple-hook cargo system, the CH-47D can carry heavy payloads internally and up to [tpl]convert|26000|lb|t[/tpl] (such as [tpl]convert|40|ft|m|adj=on|disp=or[/tpl] containers) externally. The D-model was first introduced into service in 1979. In air assault operations, it often serves as the principal mover of the 155 mm M198 howitzer, accompanying 30 rounds of ammunition and an 11-man crew. The CH-47D also has advanced avionics, such as the Global Positioning System. Nearly all US Army CH-47D were conversions from previous A, B, and C models, a total of 472 converted into D-models. The last U.S. Army D-model built was delivered to the U.S. Army Reserve, located at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2002.Boeing CH-47D model Chinook helicopters. chinook-helicopter.com
The Netherlands acquired all seven of the Canadian Forces' surviving CH-147s and upgraded them to CH-47D standard. Six more new-build CH-47Ds were delivered in 1995 for a total of 13. The Dutch CH-47D feature a number of improvements over U.S. Army CH-47Ds, including a long nose for Bendix weather radar, a "glass cockpit", and improved T55-L-714 engines. As of 2011, the Netherlands shall upgrade 11 of these which will be updated to the CH-47F standard at a later date.Boeing, Netherlands MOD Mark 1st Flight of Royal Netherlands Air Force CH-47F (NL) Chinook 26 January 2011.

===MH-47D===

The MH-47D variant was developed for special forces operations and has inflight refueling capability, a fast rope-rappelling system and other upgrades. The MH-47D was used by U.S. Army 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. 12 MH-47D helicopters were produced. Six were conversions from CH-47A models and six were conversions from CH-47C models.Boeing MH-47D model Chinook helicopters. chinook-helicopter.com

===MH-47E===

The MH-47E has been used by U.S. Army Special Operations. Beginning with the E-model prototype manufactured in 1991, there were a total of 26 Special Operations Aircraft produced. All aircraft were assigned to 2–160th SOAR(A) "Nightstalkers", home based at Fort Campbell Kentucky. E models were conversions from existing CH-47C model airframes. The MH-47E has similar capabilities as the MH-47D, but includes an increased fuel capacity similar to the CH-47SD and terrain following/terrain avoidance radar.Boeing MH-47E model Chinook helicopters. chinook-helicopter.com
In 1995, the Royal Air Force ordered eight Chinook HC3s, effectively a low-cost version of the MH-47E for the special forces operations role. They were delivered in 2001 but never entered operational service due to technical issues with their avionics fit, unique to the HC3. In 2008, work started to downgrade the HC3s to HC2 standard, to enable them to enter service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/06/06/224470/uk-starts-chinook-hc3-reversion-work-amid-criticism.html |title=UK starts Chinook HC3 'reversion' work, amid criticism |last=Hoyle |first=Craig |date=6 June 2008 |work=Flight International |accessdate=19 January 2009[/tpl]

===MH-47G===

The MH-47G Special Operations Aviation (SOA) version is currently being delivered to the U.S. Army. It is similar to the MH-47E, but features more sophisticated avionics including a digital Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS). The CAAS is a common glass cockpit used by different helicopters such as MH-60K/Ls, CH-53E/Ks, and ARH-70As.Warwick, Graham. "Chinook: CAAS unites rotorcraft cockpits".

===HH-47===

On 9 November 2006, the HH-47, a new variant of the Chinook based on the MH-47G, was selected by the U.S. Air Force as the winner of the Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR-X) competition. Four development HH-47s were to be built, with the first of 141 production aircraft planned to enter service in 2012.http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2006/q4/061109f_nr.html Boeing News Releasehttp://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/hh-47.htm Global Security.org However, in February 2007 the contract award was protested and the GAO ordered the CSAR-X project to be re-bid."Bowing To GAO, USAF Likely To Recompete CSAR-X". Aviation Week, 28 February 2007. In February 2010, the U.S. Air Force announced plans to replace aging HH-60G helicopters.

===Other export models===

The Royal Air Force variant of the CH-47C is known as the Chinook HC1. The export version of the CH-47C Chinook for the Italian Army was designated "CH-47C Plus". The Royal Air Force versions of the CH-47D are known as the Chinook HC2 and HC2A.
The HH-47D is a search and rescue version for the Republic of Korea Air Force. The CH-47DG is an upgraded version of the CH-47C for Greece. While the CH-47SD (also known as the "Super D") is a modified variant of the CH-47D, with extended range fuel tanks and higher payload carrying capacity; the CH-47SD is currently in use by the Republic of Singapore Air Force, Hellenic Army and the Republic of China Army.
Eight CH-47Cs were delivered to the Canadian Forces in 1974. These helicopters were in Canadian service until 1991, with the designation CH-147. These aircraft were subsequently sold to the Netherlands and are now operated by the Royal Netherlands Air Force as CH-47Ds. Plans are to completely replace the current fleet of 17 CH-47Ds with the F-model and enlarge the fleet to 20 aircraft, pending funding.

===Derivatives===

In 1969, work on the experimental Model 347 was begun. It was a CH-47A with a lengthened fuselage, four-blade rotors, detachable wings mounted on top of the fuselage and other changes. It first flew on 27 May 1970 and was evaluated for a few years.Goebel, Greg. "ACH-47A Gunship / Model 347 / XCH-62 HLH (Model 301) / Model 360". Vectorsite.net, 1 December 2009.
In 1973, the Army contracted Boeing to design a "Heavy Lift Helicopter" (HLH), designated XCH-62A. It appeared to be a scaled-up CH-47 without a conventional body, in a configuration similar to the S-64 Skycrane (CH-54 Tarhe), but the project was canceled in 1975. The program was restarted for test flights in the 1980s and was again not funded by Congress. The scaled up model of the HLH was scrapped at the end of 2005 at Fort Rucker, Alabama.XCH-62 with photo
