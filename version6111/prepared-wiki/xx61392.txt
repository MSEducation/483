==History==

In 1989, Boca Raton, Florida, communications attorney Mitchell Rubenstein and his wife Laurie Silvers devised the concept for the Sci-Fi Channel, and planned to have it begin 
broadcasting in December 1990, but lacked the resources to launch it.[tpl]cite web|url= http://thethunderchild.com/Television/Networks/SciFiChannel.html|publisher=The Thunder Child|title=The Sci-Fi Channel, a History of the First Two Years|first=Averil|last= Chase|date=Undated[/tpl] In March 1992, the concept was picked up by USA Networks, then a joint venture between Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/28/business/the-media-business-television-will-there-be-any-space-for-outer-space-on-cable.html?scp=5&sq=%22Sci+fi+channel%22&st=nyt|title=Will There Be Any Space For Outer Space on Cable?|last=Carter|first=Bill |date=September 28, 1992|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 7, 2009[/tpl] The channel was seen as a natural fit with classic film and television series that both studios had in their vaults, including Universal's Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Rod Serling TV series Night Gallery, and Paramount's Star Trek. Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and author Isaac Asimov were among those on the advisory board;[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-11-28/business/9011280833_1_disney-mgm-studios-channel-sci-fi|title=Sci-fi Channel Picks Disney As Home Port|last=Himna|first=Catherine|work=Orlando Sentinel[/tpl] when the channel was launched, Rubenstein recalled, "The first thing that was on the screen was 'Dedicated to the memories of Isaac Asimov and Gene Roddenberry,' members of the Channel's Board of Advisors.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.hollywood.com/news/tv/5414665/syfy-say-it-s-not-so?page=all|date=March 22, 2009 |title=Syfy, Say Iy's Not So!|first=Mitchell|last=Rubenstein|publisher=Hollywood.com|accessdate=May 29, 2013[/tpl] Leonard Nimoy was master of ceremonies at the channel's launch party, held at the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan; Asimov's widow Janet and Roddenberry's widow, Majel Barrett, were in attendance. The first program shown on the network was the film Star Wars.
In 1994, Paramount was sold to Viacom, followed by Seagram's purchase of a controlling stake in MCA (of which Universal was a subsidiary) from Matsushita the next year. In 1997, Viacom sold its stake in USA Networks to Universal, who spun off all its television assets to Barry Diller the next year. Three years later, Diller would sell these assets back to Universal, by then a subsidiary of Vivendi SA (at the time known as Vivendi Universal). Vivendi's film and television production, and cable television assets were then merged with General Electric's NBC to form NBC Universal in 2004.
A high definition version of the channel launched on October 3, 2007 on DirecTV.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tvpredictions.com/dsix100307.htm|title=DirecTV Adds Six HD Channels |first=Phillip|last=Swann|date=October 3, 2007|publisher=TVPredictions.com |accessdate=July 7, 2009[/tpl] In 2013, Syfy was awarded the James Randi Educational Foundation's Pigasus Award.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/2074-jrefs-pigasus-awards-to-honor-dubious-peddlers-of-woo.html|title=JREF's Pigasus Awards "Honors" Dubious Peddlers of "Woo" |publisher=James Randi Educational Foundation|accessdate=April 1, 2013[/tpl]

===Branding history===

For most of its history, the network's logos mostly consisted of a planet with a ring. The first depicted a ringed planet with the words "SCI-FI CHANNEL" embedded. The second, introduced in March 1999, retained the Saturn-like planet but dropped the hyphen and "Channel" from the name.[tpl]cite web|last=Bianculli|first=David|title=Freaky Fridays On Revised Sci-fi Cabler Gets Busy As Networks Nap|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-03-19/entertainment/18094908_1_sci-fi-channel-death-row-lineup|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=November 3, 2012|date=March 19, 1999[/tpl] The third, designed by Lambie-Nairn, debuted on December 2, 2002, with the launch of the Steven Spielberg miniseries Taken. The network also launched a new image campaign with the tagline "If," which expresses the limitless possibilities of the imagination. Identification bumps depicted surreal situations (such as a baby breathing fire; or a woman in a stately sitting room kissing a bug-eyed, big eared animal).[tpl]cite web|title=SCI FI Channel Re-Positions Itself as "The Channel of Imagination"|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SCI+FI+Channel+Re-Positions+Itself+as+%22The+Channel+of+Imagination%22-a095538548|work=Free Online Library|accessdate=November 3, 2012|date=Dec 17, 2002[/tpl]
On March 16, 2009, Sci-Fi announced it was changing its name to "Syfy," to end confusion over how to capitalize and stylize its name and as part of an ongoing rebranding effort. Network officials also noted that, unlike the generic term "sci fi", which represents the entire science fiction genre, the term "Syfy" as a sensational spelling can be protected by trademark and therefore would be easier to market on other goods or services without fear of confusion with other companies' products. The only significant previous use of the term "Syfy" in relation to science fiction was by the website SyFy Portal, which became Airlock Alpha after selling the brand to NBC Universal (represented by a shell company) in February 2009 for $250,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airlockalpha.com/news426164.html |title=SciFi Channel Changes Name ... To Syfy|first=Michael|last=Hinman|publisher=Airlock Alpha|date=March 15, 2009|accessdate=July 7, 2009[/tpl]
Reaction to the new name was largely negative at first, with people often pronouncing Syfy as "Siffy", "Skiffy", or "Si Fi" to make fun of the name change. The parody news anchor Stephen Colbert made fun of the name change on The Colbert Report by giving the channel a "Tip of the Hat" for "spelling the name the way it's pronounced" and noting that "the tide is turning in my long fought battle against the insidious 'soft C[tpl]'"[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/222070/march-18-2009/tip-wag---mississippi--talk-shows---syfy|title=Tip/Wag - Mississippi, Talk Shows, SyFy|date=March 18, 2009|accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl] The new name took effect on July 7, 2009. Syfy has since added reality shows and edged further from strictly science fiction, fantasy and horror programming.Syfy is Turning Into VH1: More Reality TV and Tracy Morgan, io9, March 18, 2010Syfy Announces New Programming for 2010-2011, The Flick Cast, March 19, 2010Syfy Channel 2010: More Reality, More Games, Inside TV, March 23, 2010
The rebranding efforts at NBC Universal's Sci Fi Channels worldwide resulted in most rebranding as "Syfy" or "Syfy Universal", however, over one-third of the channels did not take on "Syfy" as any part of their names: channels in Japan and the Philippines rebranded to or were replaced by Universal Channel, while each of the channels in Poland, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia would become Sci Fi Universal. In Australia, the Sci Fi channel was a joint venture not solely owned by NBC Universal; the channel was uniquely rebranded as "SF" until its closure, and was replaced by a NBC Universal solely-owned version of Syfy, branded as such, matching the standard international "Syfy" branding. "Syfy", in several languages, does not suggest imagination or science fiction so much as the syphilitic.SCI FI president Dave Howe answers your Syfy questions, Sci Fi Wire, March 20, 2009

==Programming==

Syfy's programming includes original made-for-cable movies, miniseries, and series. In the past, the channel concentrated on classic science fiction shows. However under NBCUniversal ownership, the channel has altered its schedule in the past few years to expand its lineup of programs, and Syfy now airs shows including WWE's SmackDown, changing from the original niche programming to offerings more towards general-entertainment in nature.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/television/gail-pennington/article_70d3801c-e44f-57fd-9814-2f1ceef3e8c2.html|title='Haven' widens reach of Syfy programming|first=Gail|last=Pennington|work=Tube Talk (with Gail Pennington)|publisher=stltoday.com (St. Louis Post-Dispatch)|date=July 9, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2011[/tpl]
The network had gained significant international attention for its very successful original miniseries and subsequent four-season series Battlestar Galactica. In addition to many awards,[tpl]cite web|title=List of awards and nominations received by Battlestar Galactica|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Battlestar_Galactica|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=July 15, 2012[/tpl] the United Nations invited the main cast to a retrospective and discussion.[tpl]cite web|title=UN and Battlestar Galactica host discussion of human rights and armed conflict|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30217&Cr=television&Cr1|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=July 15, 2012[/tpl]
Coupled with Battlestar Galactica, Syfy gained national prominence in 2003 with the airing of Steven Spielberg Presents: Taken, which won the Emmy Award that year for best miniseries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/nominations/2003/Outstanding%20Miniseries|title=Outstanding Miniseries 2003|accessdate=April 22, 2012|work=Emmys.com|publisher=Emmy Award[/tpl] In 2006, it also began including several non-science-fiction programs in its lineup, such as Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, ECW (changed to WWE NXT in 2010) and WCG Ultimate Gamer.
Syfy has aired anime programming off and on throughout its history. It first began airing English dubbed anime films and original video animations in the early 1990s, although the programs were often edited in order to fit the market pressures typically placed on basic cable. It was the first to show the Streamline Pictures English dubs of the films Robot Carnival, Lensman and Akira, as well as airing Central Park Media's Dominion: Tank Police, Gall Force and Project A-ko. Eventually the channel stopped airing anime, until June 11, 2007, when it began airing a weekly two-hour programming block called "Ani-Monday".[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-05-05/sci-fi-channel-launches-anime-block|title=Sci Fi Channel Launches Monday Night Anime Block|date=May 5, 2007|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=July 7, 2009[/tpl] Intended to directly compete with Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, the block features English dubs of various anime series licensed by Manga Entertainment. During February 2008, the channel also aired anime on Tuesday nights in a second programming block.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-01-03/america's-sci-fi-channel-adds-anime-on-tuesdays|title=America's Sci Fi Channel Adds Anime on Tuesdays |date=January 3, 2008|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=July 7, 2009 [/tpl] In July 2009, Syfy announced that they had renewed and expanded their licensing agreement with Manga Entertainment to continue the "Ani-Monday" block, as well as to add a similar two-hour block of horror anime, also called "Ani-Monday", to its sister channel Chiller.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/syfy-chiller-take-more-anime_article_116327.html|title=Syfy, Chiller Take On More Anime|first=Chris|last=Beveridge|publisher=ManiaEntertainment|date=July 15, 2009 |accessdate=July 15, 2009[/tpl] Syfy's anime block was moved to Thursday nights starting March 14, 2011 where is remained until all anime programming was abruptly removed from the schedule on June 9, 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-02-23/u.s-syfy-tv-channel-moves-anime-to-thursdays-in-march|title=U.S. Syfy TV Channel Moves Anime to Thursdays in March|publisher=Anime News Network|date=February 23, 2011|accessdate=January 28, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-05-27/u.s-syfy-channel-lists-no-more-anime-after-june-9|title=U.S. SyFy Channel Lists No More Anime After June 9|publisher=Anime News Network|date=May 27, 2011|accessdate=January 28, 2014[/tpl]
On April 13, 2010, World Wrestling Entertainment announced it had signed a multi-year agreement that would move WWE SmackDown from MyNetworkTV to Syfy, starting on October 1, 2010. The WWE said the show would assist Syfy with targeting of young male and female audiences."SmackDown" Goes Syfy, World Wrestling Entertainment, April 13, 2010

===Syfy original films===

Spearheaded and originally launched by Thomas Vitale in 2001, and managed by Vitale, Chris Regina, Ray Cannella, with the later additions of Karen O'Hara and Macy Lao, Sci Fi Pictures original films are typically independently-made B-movies with production budgets of $1 million to $2 million each. These films usually premiere on Saturday nights. They are also one of the sponsors for the Coalition for Freedom of Information. The movies have become one of the longest-lasting vestiges of Syfy's schedule. One of the most memorable campaigns for the movies presented these films as part of "The Most Dangerous Night of Television" (Saturdays). Over the years, Syfy's promotion of the movies leans into the escapist fun promised by them, with titles such as Sharktopus, Mansquito, Two-Headed Shark Attack, Ogre, Ice Twisters, Star Runners and Sharknado. Since 2001, Syfy has worked with a number of different production companies (most of them independent) to make over 200 original movies of this type.
