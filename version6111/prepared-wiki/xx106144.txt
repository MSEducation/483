Equal Vision Records is a record label based in Albany, New York, which has a focus in metal or punk-based rock genres. Equal Vision Records was founded in the early 1990s by Ray Cappo (Youth of Today, Shelter, Better Than a Thousand).
The label originally existed solely to distribute Shelter and other Krishna releases. In 1992, label manager Steve Reddy bought EVR from Cappo. The focus was expanded and a wider variety of bands were brought on board. According to Punk News,http://www.punknews.org/labels/equalvision "The mid-to-late '90s saw a redoubling of the Equal Vision's hardcore efforts with such signings as One King Down and Ten Yard Fight. By the end of the '90s EVR found itself with an impressive stable of hardcore and punk bands, having added Bane, Trial, Converge and Saves the Day to its roster in the latter part of the decade."
