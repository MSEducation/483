The Court has granted preliminary approval to the settlement agreement.
Charleston County, S.C, sued Tata Consultancy Services for delivering a botched software. TCS won the contract to create an online tax system (digiTax) for a $1.2 million. The system was supposed to go live in July, 2004 but was plagued by several delays. Tata developed the software at its offshore development center in Chennai, India. The software was rejected by Charleston County during user acceptance testing where it failed to meet even the basic requirements. County sued Tata and it agreed to pay back $1 million in out of court settlement. County finally bought out of box solution.
