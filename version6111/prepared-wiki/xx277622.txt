==Founder==

Founded by the Austrian inventor Albert J. Dremel in 1932, the company is located in Racine, Wisconsin. Albert J. Dremel held 55 patents across a wide range of inventions,[tpl]cite web|title=Albert J Dremel Patents|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=pts&hl=en&q=ininventor:%22Albert+J+Dremel%22|publisher=Google Patents|accessdate=14 November 2013[/tpl]  including the electric eraser, electric fish scaler, electric shoe polisher, electric screwdriver, power sanders, scroll saws, a device to keep tabs on chicken's egg production and first design of the now standard walk behind rotary lawn mower. His first product released within the company was with an electric razor blade sharpener. This success was soon brought to a halt after popularity of cheap, disposable razors came into effect. This then forced Albert J. Dremel to come up with his next invention, seen as the most important of his career – the high speed rotary tool, later named the Dremel Multitool. Compact, lightweight and versatile, this invention was successful in the hobby and craft market.
In 1948, Dremel gave his employees 3.0% year-end profit sharing (something that at the time was seen as a radical idea). Dremel helped introduce the notion that it was the employer’s responsibility to ensure all employees were working in a safe and comfortable working environment. He died on 18 July 1968 at the age of 81.
People found many ways to use the rotary tools that Dremel created. In the 1940s the Defense Department used them to create the first atomic bomb.[tpl]cite web|title=Dremel Company|url=http://www.insidewoodworking.com/companiesbrands/dremel.html|publisher=Inside Woodworoking|accessdate=14 November 2013[/tpl]  Military doctors used the tools in dermal abrasion techniques to reduce scar tissue from battle wounds. Dremel tools are also used in tattoo removal.It is also used by Podorthists for use on shoe inserts and Dentists use them for crafting dentures.
There are more than 17 million rotary tools in use today.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dremel.com/es-es/misc/history/Pages/default.aspx |title=Dremel History |work=http://www.dremel.com/ |publisher=Dremel |accessdate=2013-10-31[/tpl]
