[[America the Beautiful Silver Bullion Coins]]

CATEGORIES: Coins of the United States, United States silver coins, Silver coins

The America the Beautiful Silver Bullion Coins comprise a series of silver bullion coins with a face value of a quarter dollar. The coins contain five troy ounces of silver making them the largest silver bullion coins ever issued by the United States Mint. The design of the coins duplicate exactly—though enlarged—each of the America the Beautiful Quarters. They have been issued by the United States Mint since 2010 and will continue to be issued until at least 2021. The coins are available for sale during the year in which their corresponding circulating coin is issued. The coins are distributed by the United States Mint's network of authorized bullion dealers and also may be resold at the discretion of the Director of the National Park Service.

==Differences between coin and bullion version==

There are four main differences between the coin version (for collectors) and the bullion version (for investors). 
As of the last part of 2013, there are not considerable price differences between the two versions.

The obverse of all the coins will depict George Washington in a restored version of the portrait created by John Flanagan for the 1932 Washington Quarter, while the reverse is set to feature five new designs annually (one in 2021), each depicting a national park or national site (one from each state, the federal district, and each territory).

==Legislative history==

The program is authorized by Title II of the America’s Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008.
