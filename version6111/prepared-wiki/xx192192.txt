==Betting scandal==

After the 21 August 2010 Canterbury match against the North Queensland Cowboys Tandy became embroiled in a betting scandal. The Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) announced that 95 per cent of bets placed on the first scoring play of this match were for the unusual option of a Cowboys penalty goal. Tandy is alleged to have placed some of these bets himself, [tpl]fact|date=May 2012[/tpl] and then taken action in the match to allow the opposing side to score a penalty goal. Tandy gave away possession to the Cowboys in the opening moments of the match by knocking on, and then gave away a penalty. These actions put the Cowboys in a position where a penalty goal was a likely outcome. However, the Cowboys decided on an attacking option and scored a try instead.
Tandy strongly denied the accusations of deliberately giving away possession and a penalty to allow the exotic option on the bets to be successful. Despite this, he was arrested on 2 February 2011[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] for providing false evidence to a law enforcement agency during the investigation of the betting scandal.[tpl]cite news |author=Ben Horne |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/nrl-wont-speculate-on-punting-penalty-20100830-14766.html |title=NRL won't speculate on punting penalty |work=Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=News.smh.com.au |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=28 April 2014[/tpl] He received an intensive correction order for six months.
