Lake Kipawa (in French: Lac Kipawa) is a lake in far south-west Quebec, Canada, near the border with Ontario, north of Témiscaming, Quebec.  Also see Kipawa River which is the only natural outflow of Kipawa Lake, the southern Gordon Creek in Temiskaming sud being a man made channel.
Lake Kipawa is currently the source of debate among Innergex and Hydro Quebec concerning water rights for their competing hydro electric projects.
Lake Kipawa is highly irregularly shaped, with deep bays (such as Chemagan, des Plongeurs, du Huard, Dorval, Pratt, des Anglais, and Campbell) and large islands (notably McKenzie and aux Ours). It forms a vast labyrinth with many other interconnecting bodies of water.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/CT/toposweb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=32541 |title=Lac Kipawa |accessdate=2009-11-17 |publisher=Commission de toponymie du Québec |language=French[/tpl] Bordering the lake are the communities of Kipawa, Laniel, and the Keboawek Reserve. The lake is popular with fishermen for its walleye and northern pike abundance, as well as a supply of trout. Various lodges (such as Kipawa Lodge which is located at Edward's Narrows) bordering the lake offer hunting and fishing tours and accommodations.
The lake's name, of Algonquin origin, has been written in many different forms before "Kipawa" became official in 1968: Kippawa, Kippewa, Kepawa, Keepawe (1884), Kipawe, Kipakowe, Kipahowe.
Lake Kipawa was the epicenter of the 2000 Kipawa earthquake.
