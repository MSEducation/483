CATEGORIES: Hyperbolic geometry, Curves

In hyperbolic geometry, a hypercycle, hypercircle or equidistant curve is a curve whose points have the same orthogonal distance from a given straight line.

==Construction==

Given a straight line L and a point P not on L, 
we can construct a hypercycle by taking all points Q on the same side of L as P, with perpendicular distance to L equal to that of P.
The line L is called the axis, center, or base line of the hypercycle.
The orthogonal segments from each point to L are called radii.
Their common length is called distance.
In the Poincar√© disk and half-plane models of the hyperbolic plane, hypercycles are represented by lines and circle arcs that intersect the boundary circle/line at non-right angles. The representation of the axis intersects the boundary circle/line in the same points, but at right angles.
The hypercycles through a given point that share a tangent through that point converge towards a horocycle as their distances go towards infinity.

==Properties==

Hypercycles in hyperbolic geometry have some properties similar to those of circles in Euclidean geometry:
