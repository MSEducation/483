[[Flag of Guyana]]

CATEGORIES: National flags, National symbols of Guyana

The flag of Guyana, known as The Golden Arrow, has been the national flag of Guyana since May 1966 when the country became independent from the United Kingdom.  It was designed by Whitney Smith, an American vexillologist (though originally without the black and white fimbriations, which were later additions suggested by the College of Arms in the United Kingdom).  
The proportions of the national flag are 3:5.  The colours are symbolic, with green for agriculture and forests, white for rivers and water, gold for mineral wealth, black for endurance, and red for zeal and dynamism.
