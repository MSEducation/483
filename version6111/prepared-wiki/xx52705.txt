Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fia.com/en-GB/the-fia/about-fia/Pages/AboutFIA.aspx |title=About FIA |publisher=Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) |accessdate=31 October 2008 [/tpl] The "formula" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and vehicles must conform. The F1 World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. The results of each race are combined to determine two annual Championships, one for drivers and one for constructors.
The first World Championship Grand Prix was held in [tpl]F1|1950[/tpl] at Silverstone; since then 69 circuits have hosted a Grand Prix. Circuits such as the Nürburgring have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations. The first race at the Nürburgring used the [tpl]convert|22.835|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] configuration, but concerns over safety meant that more recent Grands Prix have used a shorter, safer circuit.[tpl]harvnb|Hughes|Tremayne|2002|p=76[/tpl] F1 circuits were predominately in Europe during the early years of the championship, as the sport has expanded so has the location of its circuits. The expansion into Asia and America has been a recent occurrence. Of the 20 circuits that hosted a Grand Prix in [tpl]F1|2012[/tpl], nearly half were not on the calendar before [tpl]F1|1999[/tpl].[tpl]cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/formula-1/news/22058/7283408/A-truly-global-sport |title=A truly global sport |publisher=Sky Sports |date=31 October 2011 |accessdate=18 June 2012 |first=Pete |last=Gill [/tpl]
The Autodromo Nazionale Monza has hosted the most Grands Prix; it has been used as the circuit for the Italian Grand Prix 63 times. The only season it did not host a race was in [tpl]F1|1980[/tpl], when the Italian Grand Prix was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2006/9/4900.html |title=Facts and figures – Italian Grand Prix |publisher=Formula 1 |date=7 September 2006 |accessdate=22 June 2012 [/tpl] The Circuit of the Americas became the 69th circuit to host a Grand Prix, when it held the United States Grand Prix in 2012. The longest circuit to have hosted a Grand Prix is the Pescara Circuit, which hosted the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix. The [tpl]convert|25.800|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long circuit in Pescara, Italy, held the annual Coppa Acerbo race; in [tpl]F1|1957[/tpl] it was included as part of the World Championship, a race which Stirling Moss won.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.espnf1.com/italy/motorsport/circuit/1273.html |title=Pescara Circuit |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=18 June 2012 [/tpl]
As some circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations, the most recent configuration used is listed in the table below.
