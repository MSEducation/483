The sex of many fishes is not fixed, but can change with physical and social changes to the environment where the fish lives.Chan STH and Yeung WSB (1983) "Sex control and sex reversal in fish under natural conditions". Pages 171–222 in WS Hoar, DJ Randall and EM Donaldson, eds., Fish physiology 9B: Reproduction, behavior and fertility control. Academic Press. "Sex change occurs mainly in fishes in which one sex had higher survival and reproductive rates, usually as the result of larger size. In such situations it may pay for an individual of the smaller sex to change to the larger sex when the opportunity arises.[tpl]cite journal | doi= 10.1023/A:1007389519702 | year= 1998 | last1= Kuwamura | first1= Tetsuo | last2= Nakashima | first2= Yasuhiro | journal= Environmental Biology of Fishes | volume= 52 | pages= 125–135 [/tpl] For example anemone fishes live as monogamous pairs in single anemones, protected from predators by the stings of the anemone. Female anemone fish are typically larger than males, because a male does not have to vigorously compete for mates once he has paired with a female.

===Unisexuality===

Unisexuality occurs when a species is all-male or all-female. Unisexuality occurs in some fish species, and can take complex forms. Squalius alburnoides, a minnow found in several river basins in Portugal and Spain, appears to be an all-male species. The existence of this species illustrates the potential complexity of mating systems in fish. The species originated as a hybrid between two species, and is diploid, but not hermaphroditic. It can have triploid and tetraploid forms, including all-female forms that reproduce mainly through hybridogenesis.[tpl]cite journal | author = Alves MJ, Collarea-Pereira MJ, Dowling TE, Coelho MM | year = 2002 | title = The genetics of maintenance of an all-male lineage in the Squalius alburnoides complex | url = | journal = J.

==Spawning strategies==

This section is patterned after a classification of the spawning behaviours of fish by Balon (1975, 1984) into reproductive guilds. This classification is based on how the eggs are fertilized (internal or external spawners), where the eggs are deposited (pelagic or benthic spawners), and whether and how the parents look after the eggs after spawning (bearers, guarders and nonguarders).[ref]Adapted from

===Nonguarders===

Nonguarders do not protect their eggs and offspring after spawning

====Open substrate spawners====

Open substrate spawners scatter their eggs in the environment. They usually spawn in shoals without complex courtship rituals, and males outnumber females.
Broadcast spawners: release their gametes (sperm and eggs) into open water for external fertilisation. There is no subsequent parental care.Broadcast spawners Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 3 February 2011. About 75% of coral species are broadcasters, the majority of which are hermatypic, or reef-building corals.

====Brood hiders====

Brood hiders hide their eggs but do not give parental care after they have hidden them. Brood hiders are mostly benthic spawners that bury the fertilized eggs. For example, among salmon and trout the female digs a nest with her tail in gravel.  These nests are called redds. The female then lays her eggs while the male fertilizes them, while both fish defend the redd if necessary from other members of the same species. Then the female buries the nest, and the nest site is abandoned. In North America, some minnows build nests out of piles of stones rather than dig holes. The minnow males have tubercles on their head and body which they use to help them defend the nest site.[tpl]rp|145[/tpl]
Bitterlings have a remarkable reproduction strategy where parents transfer responsibility for the care of their young to mussels. The female extends her ovipositor into the mantle cavity of the mussel and deposits her eggs between the gill filaments. The male then ejects his sperm into the mussel's inhalant water current and fertilization takes place within the gills of the host. The same female may use a number of mussels, and she deposits only one or two yellow, oval eggs into each. Early developmental stages are protected from predation within the body of the mussel. After 3 to 4 weeks larvae swim away from the host to continue life on their own.

===Guarders===

Guarders protect their eggs and offspring after spawning by practicing parental care (also called brood care). Parental care is an "investment by parents in offspring that increases the offsprings' chances of surviving (and hence reproducing). In fish, parental care can take a variety of forms including guarding, nest building, fanning, splashing, removal of dead eggs, retrieval of straying fry, external egg carrying, egg burying, moving eggs or young, ectodermal feeding, oral brooding, internal gestation, brood-pouch egg carrying, etc."Parental care Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 3 February 2011.
Territorial behaviour is generally necessary for guarders, and the embryos are almost always guarded by males (apart from cichlids). There is a need to be territorial because looking after embryos usually includes defending the site where they are being looked after. It also often means there is competition for the best egg-laying sites. Elaborate courtship behaviour is usual among guarders.[tpl]Rp|145[/tpl]
Guarding males keep the embryos safe from predators, keep oxygen levels high by fanning water currents, and keep the area free from dead embryos and debris. They protect the embryos until they hatch, and often look after the larval stages as well. The time spent guarding can range from a few days to several months.[tpl]Rp|145[/tpl]

====Substrate spawners====

Some guarders build nests (nest spawners) and some do not (substrate spawners), though the difference between the two groups can be small.[tpl]Rp|142[/tpl] Substrate spawners clean off a suitable area of surface suitable for egg laying, and look after the area, but they do not actively build a nest.

====Nest spawners====

Nest spawners construct "some sort of structure, cavity, or pit in which the eggs are laid and fertilized and the embryos are defended. The young are often defended in a nest as well, and in some species, the parents even herd schools of young around for a period of time. Pit nests can be made of a wide variety of material, but the most common are nests of gravel and rocks. Such nests are typically shallow depressions that are carefully constructed and tended by territorial  males. Most sunfishes and black basses (Centrarchidae) construct nests of this sort, often in colonies. The males defend the embryos and the young until the young become too active to be kept in the nest. In some cichlids eggs are laid and incubated in one nest depression, but the young are tended (by both parents) in one or more additional depressions that are constructed nearby."[tpl]Rp|146[/tpl]
"A few species construct nests on sandy bottoms. Either the eggs and embryos in such nests have special adaptations (e.g., semibuoyancy) to reduce the possibility of being smothered, or the parent fish must spend considerable time handling them."[tpl]Rp|146[/tpl]
"In areas where bottoms are muddy, nest-building fish commonly build nests of plant material. Usually plant-nesting fishes construct loose aggregations of material in which the eggs are laid. One special type of plant-nest builder uses a kidney secretion to glue the pieces of plant together to form a tight nest. The main examples of this type of nesting are the sticklebacks in which the male builds a tube which is usually attached to rooted plants or is placed in a small pit. By means of a complicated courtship ritual, a female is enticed into a nest, where she deposits some eggs after being nudged by the male. After the eggs are laid, he chases the female out and fertilizes them. This process is repeated several times, until enough embryos are in the nest and the male begins to incubate them by fanning currents of water across them. After the embryos hatch, the male guards the young for several days, first in the nest, and then in a shoal outside the nest."[tpl]Rp|146[/tpl]
"Perhaps the most common type of nests among fishes are those in caves, cavities, or burrows. These nests are characteristic of fish that live in active habitats, such as rocky intertidal zone or streams. For stream-dwelling fishes, the typical cave nest is the underside of a flat rock in midstream, which has plenty of current to keep the water well oxygenated. Sculpins and many darters deposit their eggs in clusters on the roofs of such shelters and then guard the embryos until they hatch. In quieter water, minnows, such as the fathead minnow, lay their eggs on the underside of a log or a board in an area that has been cleaned off by the male. Spawning males develop a thick horny pad on their head, which is used for rubbing algae and other materials of the spawning surface. Many large catfishes lay their eggs in cavities ranging from hollow logs to old muskrat burrows to oil drums, where the embryoes are guarded by the males. These catfish also guard schools of young for one or more weeks after they emerge from the nest."[tpl]Rp|146[/tpl]

===Bearers===

Bearers are fish that carry their embryos (and sometimes their young) around with them, either externally or internally.

====External bearers====

"Fishes that carry their embryos externally have developed a wide variety of ways for doing so, ranging from the short-term attachment of embryos to the adult until a suitable place is found to put them (transfer brooders) to the carrying of embryos and young in special pouches. Good examples of various kinds of bearers can be found amongst pipefishes and seahorses. In this family, only the males do the brooding. After the eggs are fertilized, the female places the embryos on the male. Herald (1950) notes a continuum of forms in the Syngnathidae, starting with skin-brooding pipefishes and ending with seahorses, which have closed pouches with only one opening. In seahorses, after an extended courtship period, the female deposits eggs in the pouch (marsupium) of the male by means of a penis-like oviduct. The eggs are fertilized as they enter the marsupium, and 25 to 100 embryos are provided with nutrients, oxygen and protection (Jones and Avise 1997). After hatching, the free embryos are carried in the pouch until they are capable of fairly active swimming, at which time they are expelled by the brooding male."[tpl]Rp|146–147[/tpl]
"Another method of internally carrying young that are spawned externally occurs in mouth brooders. This method is found in families as diverse as sea catfishes, cichlids, cardinal fishes and bonytongues. Mouthbrooders carry the large, yolky embryos until they hatch, and these brooders typically carry the free embryos about as well. Even after the young become active, they are usually closely associated with the parent fish for a period of time and may flee back into the mouth cavity when threatened. In cichlids, both sexes may participate in some species, but the female usually carries the embryos, which she picks up quickly after spawning."[tpl]Rp|147[/tpl]
Mouth brooders - carry eggs or larvae in their mouth. Mouth brooders can be ovophiles or larvophiles. Ovophile or egg-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs in a pit, which are sucked up into the mouth of the female. The small number of large eggs hatch in the mother's mouth, and the fry remain there for a period of time. Fertilization often occurs with the help of egg-spots, which are colorful spots on the anal fin of the male. When the female sees these spots, she tries to pick up the egg-spots, but instead gets a mouthful of sperm, fertilizing the eggs in her mouth. Many cichlids and some labyrinth fish are ovophile mouthbrooders. Larvophile or larvae-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs on a substrate and guard them until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the female picks up the fry and keeps them in her mouth. When the fry can fend for themselves, they are released. Some eartheaters are larvophile mouthbrooders.

====Internal bearers====

"Internal bearers may have similarities to pouch brooders, although fertilization is internal and females always carry the embryos and/or young. Internal bearers typically produce only a small number of large,  active young, which is a strategy characteristic of all sharks and rays and a few bony fish. There seems to be no strong correlation between internal bearing families and the elaborateness of courtship behaviour. In guppies, mosquitofish and other livebearing poeciliids. the most important trait of the courtship behaviour of males that successfully copulate with females seems to be persistence (although subtle interactions among competing males and other courtship-related behaviour do exist). In contrast, some surfperches have fairly elaborate courtship behaviour, with males establishing breeding territories to attract passing females."[tpl]Rp|147[/tpl]
Facultative internal bearers: The beginning of the evolutionary process of livebearing starts with facultative (optional) internal bearing. The process occurs in several species of oviparous (egg-laying) killifishes which spawn in the normal way on the substrate, but in the process accidentally fertilize eggs which the female retains and does not spawn. These eggs are spawned later, usually without allowing much time for embryonic development.[tpl]Rp|147[/tpl]

Obligate internal bearers: The next step in the evolution of livebearing is obligate (by necessity) internal bearing, where  the female retains all the embryos. "The only source of nutrition for these embryos, however, is the egg yolk, as in externally spawned eggs. This situation, also referred to as ovoviviparity, is characteristic of marine rock fishes and the Lake Baikal sculpins. This strategy allows these fish to have fecundities approaching those of pelagic fish with external fertilization, but it also enables them to protect the young during their most vulnerable stage of development. By contrast, sharks and rays using this strategy produce a relatively small number of embryos and retain them for a few weeks to 16 months or longer. The shorter times spans are characteristic of species that eventually deposit their embryos in the environment, surrounded by a horny capsule; whereas the longer periods are characteristic of sharks that retain the embryos until they are ready to emerge as actively swimming young."[tpl]Rp|147[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Wourms JP | year = 1981 | title = Viviparity: The Maternal-Fetal Relationship in Fishes | url = http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/473.abstract | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 473–515 | doi = 10.1093/icb/21.2.473 [/tpl]
Viviparous fish: "Given the advantages of retaining the embryos internally, it is not surprising that a number of fishes have developed means to provide additional nutrition for their young while the female is carrying them and then give birth to large, active young (viviparity). Viviparous fishes provide nutrition for their young in various ways. The greatest variety occurs in sharks, but the teleosts also show a considerable range of methods. In the superperches, the young develop in the mother's ovary and obtain nutrients through the close contact of the extra-large fins with the ovarian wall. Many poeciliid embryos have highly vascular pericardial tissue that loops around the neck and is in close contact with the ovarian wall of the mother, through which nutrients are exchanged."[tpl]Rp|148[/tpl]
However, some fish do not fit these categories. The livebearing largespring gambusia (Gambusia geiseri) was thought to be ovoviviparous until it was shown in 2001 that the embryos received nutrients from the mother.Marsh-Matthews E, Skierkowski P and DeMarais A (2001) "Direct Evidence for Mother-to-Embryo Transfer of Nutrients in the Livebearing Fish Gambusia geiseri" Copeia, 2001: 1(1-6).

==Spawning grounds==

Spawning grounds are the areas of water where aquatic animals spawn, or produce their eggs. After spawning, the spawn may or may not drift to new grounds which become their nursery grounds. Many species undertake migrations each year, and sometimes great migrations, to reach their spawning grounds. For example, lakes and river watersheds can be major spawning grounds for anadromous fish such as salmon. These days, it is often necessary to construct fish ladders and other bypass systems so salmon can navigate their way past hydroelectric dams or other obstructions such as weirs on their way to spawning grounds.Office Of Technology Assessment Washington DC (1995) Fish passage technologies : protection at hydropower facilities Diana Publishing, ISBN 1-4289-2016-1.To Save the Salmon (1997) US Army Corps of Engineers. Coastal fish often use mangroves and estuaries as spawning grounds, while reef fish can find adjacent seagrass meadows that make good spawning grounds. Short-finned eels can travel anything up to three or four thousand kilometres to their spawning ground in deep water somewhere in the Coral Sea.
Forage fish often make great migrations between their spawning, feeding and nursery grounds. Schools of a particular stock usually travel in a triangle between these grounds. For example, one stock of herrings have their spawning ground in southern Norway,  their feeding ground in Iceland, and their nursery ground in northern Norway. Wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish, when feeding, cannot distinguish their own offspring.[tpl]cite journal | author = Dragesund O, Johannessen A, Ulltang Ø | year = 1997 | title = Variation in migration and abundance of Norwegian spring spawning herring (Clupea harengus L.) | url = http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/31859.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Sarsia | volume = 82 | issue = | pages = 97–105 [/tpl]
Capelin are a forage fish of the smelt family found in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. In summer, they graze on dense swarms of plankton at the edge of the ice shelf. Larger capelin also eat krill and other crustaceans. The capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between Iceland, Greenland, and Jan Mayen. The migration is affected by ocean currents. Around Iceland maturing capelin make large northward feeding migrations in spring and summer. The return migration takes place in September to November. The spawning migration starts north of Iceland in December or January.Vilhjalmsson H (2002) "Capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the Iceland–East Greenland–Jan Mayen ecosystem" ICES Journal of Marine Science, 59: 870–883. [tpl]doi|10.1006/jmsc.2002.1233[/tpl] available online.
The diagram on the right shows the main spawning grounds and larval drift routes. Capelin on the way to feeding grounds is coloured green, capelin on the way back is blue, and the breeding grounds are red. In a paper published in 2009, researchers from Iceland recount their application of an interacting particle model to the capelin stock around Iceland, successfully predicting the spawning migration route for 2008.Barbaro1 A, Einarsson B, Birnir1 B, Sigurðsson S, Valdimarsson S, Pálsson ÓK, Sveinbjörnsson S and Sigurðsson P (2009)  "Modelling and simulations of the migration of pelagic fish" Journal of Marine Science, 66(5):826-838.
Referred to as "the greatest shoal on earth", the sardine run occurs when millions of sardines migrate from their spawning grounds south of the southern tip of Africa northward along the Eastern Cape coastline. Chinook salmon make the longest freshwater migration of any salmon, over [tpl]convert|3000|km[/tpl] up the Yukon River to spawning grounds upstream of Whitehorse, Yukon. Some green sea turtles swim more than [tpl]convert|2600|km[/tpl] to reach their spawning grounds.

==Examples==

===Fish===

Goldfish, like all cyprinids, are egg-layers. They usually start breeding after a significant temperature change, often in spring. Males chase females, prompting them to release their eggs by bumping and nudging them. As the female goldfish spawns her eggs, the male goldfish stays close behind fertilizing them. Their eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic vegetation. The eggs hatch within 48 to 72 hours. Within a week or so, the fry begins to assume its final shape, although a year may pass before they develop a mature goldfish colour; until then they are a metallic brown like their wild ancestors. In their first weeks of life, the fry grow quickly—an adaptation born of the high risk of getting devoured by the adult goldfish.
A member of the Cyprinidae family, carp spawn in times between April and August, largely dependant upon the climate and conditions they live in. Oxygen levels of the water, availability of food, size of each fish, age, number of times the fish has spawned before and water temperature are all factors known to effect when and how many eggs each carp will spawn at any one time.http://www.carp.me.uk Carp Spawning Information
Prior to spawning, male Siamese fighting fish build bubble nests of varying sizes at the surface of the water. When a male becomes interested in a female, he will flare his gills, twist his body, and spread his fins. The female darkens in colour and curves her body back and forth. The act of spawning takes place in a "nuptial embrace" where the male wraps his body around the female, each embrace resulting in the release of 10-40 eggs until the female is exhausted of eggs. The male, from his side, releases milt into the water and fertilization takes place externally. During and after spawning, the male uses his mouth to retrieve sinking eggs and deposit them in the bubble nest (during mating the female sometimes assists her partner, but more often she will simply devour all the eggs that she manages to catch). Once the female has released all of her eggs, she is chased away from the male's territory, as it is likely that she'll eat the eggs due to hunger.Leong, Paul (2004). http://www.cbsbettas.org/doc/articles/Tips_on_Spawning_Bettas.htm. Retrieved on March 13, 2009. The eggs then remain in the male's care. He keeps them in the bubble nest, making sure none fall to the bottom and repairing the nest as needed. Incubation lasts for 24–36 hours, and the newly hatched larvae remain in the nest for the next 2–3 days, until their yolk sacs are fully absorbed. Afterwards the fry leave the nest and the free-swimming stage begins.Rainwate FL and Miller EJ (1967) "Courtship and reproductive behavior of the Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens Regan" Proceedings of the Oklahoma  Academy of Science, Oklahoma State University.
