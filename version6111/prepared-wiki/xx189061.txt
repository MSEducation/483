Kingsland Homestead, located in Flushing, Queens is a New York City landmark and member of the Historic House Trust. It is the home of the remains of a landmarked, weeping beech tree, believed planted in 1847 and located 
near the 17th Century Bowne House, the location of the first Quaker meeting place in New Amsterdam. The homestead houses and is operated by the Queens Historical Society and is open to the public as a museum.

==About the house==

Kingsland was built by Charles Doughty in approximately 1785 and the name "Kingsland" is believed to derive from Doughty's son-in-law, British sea captain Joseph King, who bought the home in 1801.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_about/parks_divisions/historic_houses/hh_kingsland_homestead.html|title=Kingsland Homestead, Weeping Beech Park|accessdate=2008-04-28|publisher=New York City Department of Parks & Recreation[/tpl] The house was moved for the first time in 1923 when a proposed subway extension put it in danger and it was moved to the site of a stable, also built by King. The house was threatened again in 1965, by the construction of the Murray Hill Shopping Center, but the community was able to save the house and in that same year it was one of the first buildings in the City to be declared a landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40C15FC3C54167A93CAA8178BD95F418685F9|title=First Official Landmarks of City Designated|accessdate=2008-04-28|date=1965-10-18|author=Farnsworth Fowle|work=The New York Times[/tpl] When further construction threatened the house in 1968, the then three-year old Kingsland Preservation Committee (now the Queens Historical Society) arranged for the transfer of the house to its present location. After significant delays, the Homestead was officially dedicated as a museum in March 1973.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60813FC385F107A93C7AB1788D85F478785F9|title=Kingsland Homestead Now a Museum; Many Delays|accessdate=2008-04-28|date=1973-03-25|work=The New York Times[/tpl] In October 1996 a $330,000 renovation that completely restored the house and included the addition of track lighting and a sprinkler system to protect the house was completed.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/ny_local/1996/10/13/1996-10-13_kingsland_s_royal_rehab_done.html|title=Kingsland's Royal Rehab Done 1785 Home set to Show New Look|accessdate=2008-04-28|date=1996-10-13|author=Donald Bertrand|work=Daily News[/tpl] Further structural work was required in 1999.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/ny_local/1999/11/18/1999-11-18_neighborhood_news__state_to_.html|title=State to Provide $10,000 for Kingsland Restoration|accessdate=2008-04-28|date=1999-11-18|work=Daily News[/tpl]

==Weeping Beech==

Within the main park that houses the Homestead is the [tpl]convert|2|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] Weeping Beech Park,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=222|title=Weeping Beech Park|accessdate=2008-04-28|publisher=New York City Department of Parks & Recreation|date=2001-11-01[/tpl] once dominated by a landmarked [tpl]convert|60|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] weeping beech tree.

The tree survived for 151 years before succumbing, following a 30-year decline and fear that she would fall.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E4DC1539F932A25756C0A961958260|title=Venerable Beech Makes it to Her Party|accessdate=2008-04-28|date=1997-05-11|author=Charlie Leduff|work=The New York Times[/tpl] Seven direct descendants remain in the park, shadowing the Homestead.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.historichousetrust.org/item.php?i_id=18|title=Kingsland Homestead|accessdate=2008-04-28|publisher=Historic House Trust of New York City[/tpl] A funeral was held for the tree in December 1998 by the city's Parks Commissioner while they decided what to do with the remains of the tree. In March 1999 it was decided that the remains of the tree, save for a ten-foot section that would remain in the park as a memorial, would be given to artists to use for sculptures and benches along a heritage trail in downtown Flushing.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E7DE153EF937A25750C0A96F958260|title=Update; Weeping Beech Will Live On in Memory, and in Art|accessdate=2008-04-28|date=1999-03-14|author=Richard Weir|work=The New York Times[/tpl]
