==U.S. service==

The USCGC Jarvis was named for David H. Jarvis, a hero of the United States Revenue Cutter Service. During the harsh winter of 1897–1898, Lieutenant Jarvis of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Bear led the Overland Relief Expedition to bring needed food to 265 whalers whose ships had been stranded in the ice off the northern coast of Alaska.[tpl]cite book|first=Irving H.|last=King|title=The Coast Guard Expands, 1865-1915: New Roles, New Frontiers|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1996|pages=94–107|isbn=1-55750-458-X[/tpl] The high endurance cutter was launched 24 April 1971 at Avondale Shipyard near New Orleans, Louisiana and was commissioned 4 August 1972 at Honolulu, Hawaii, where she would be based for the rest of her career. She received a $55 million Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization Program (FRAM) upgrade at Todd Pacific Shipyards in Seattle, Washington between July 1990 and December 1992. Jarvis completed her final cruise in late September 2012, and was removed from active service the following week.
