[[Shenzhou (album)]]

CATEGORIES: 2002 albums, Biosphere albums, Touch Music albums

Shenzhou is an album by ambient musician Biosphere which was released on June 3, 2002.  The structure and sound of this album is drastically minimalistic in comparison with Geir Jenssen's previous work up to this point, a concept that would be further elaborated upon with the next album. Samples are taken from several of Claude Debussy's orchestral works, particularly La Mer and Rondes de printemps. The album's name, "Shenzhou", aside from being the name of the Chinese manned-spaceflight vehicles, means magic vessel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/709-shenzhou |title=Biosphere: Shenzhou | Album Reviews |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2002-11-13 |accessdate=2012-03-09[/tpl]
