Michel Chion born in 1947 in Creil, France, is a composer of experimental music. He teaches at several institutions within France and currently holds the post of Associate Professor at the University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle where he is a theoretician and teacher of audio-visual relationships.
After studying literature and music he began to work for the ORTF (French Radio and Television Organisation) Service de La recherche as assistant to Pierre Schaeffer in 1970. He was a member of the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM) between 1971 - 1976.
His compositional pieces elaborate on schaeffarian theories and methodologies which Schaeffer referred to as musique concrète.
He has also written a number of books as well as essays expounding his theories of the interaction between sound and image within the medium of film.
In particular, the book titled L’audio-vision. Son et image au cinéma, originally published in France in 1990
, has been considered by the critics as the definitive book on the relations between sound and image, which are described as two different languages within the multimedia art form, discussing the argument from both technical-linguistic and aesthetic points of view, where before it was discussed principally in terms of narrative implications.
