Thomas 'Tommy' Jenkins (born 6 June 1902, date of death unknown) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Essendon and North Melbourne in the VFL during the 1920s. 
Jenkins arrived at Essendon in 1921 after his VFA club North Melbourne had disbanded and spent five seasons with the Bombers. Short but large, Jenkins played mostly as a full-forward and was a premiership player in 1923 and 1924. He twice topped Essendon's goalkicking, in 1924 with 50 goals and 1925 with 37 goals. His best tally in a game was 9 goals against North Melbourne in 1925, who had by then got back together and joined the VFL. In 1927 he returned to his old club but could manage only three senior games.
