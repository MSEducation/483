==Television show==

The Live Prayer television program began March 3, 2003 as a late-night show on WTOG where Bill Keller discussed current events from in relation to the ministry's theology and took phone calls. Callers would mostly ask Keller to pray with them over specific issues in their lives, occasionally contributing testimony of religious experience and their comments on scripture. Keller would sometimes encourage his opponents to call in and debate with him on contentions issues such as evolution, abortion, and homosexuality. Each episode ended with Keller inviting viewers to "accept Jesus" and recite a sinner's prayer with him.
Starting July 2006, the show was seen nationwide on ION Television, however this ended in November when Keller could not raise enough money to pay the significantly higher airtime fees. Live Prayer was, up until this point, shown without advertising and paid for entirely by donations. However, near the end of his time on ION, Keller began showing a limited number of ads from companies promoting gold investment schemes. Keller made a point of criticizing other televangelists for continually begging for money and misappropriating the donations they received. Keller also made his personal financial records available to reporters on request and informed viewers that his studio was austerely located on the donated grounds of a used car lot.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://liveprayer.com/ddarchive3.cfm?id=4140|publisher=Live Prayer Daily Devotional|title=Over the Years You have been an Incredible Blessing to Me and the Work of God at Liveprayer|date=2010-07-27 |accessdate=2011-12-17[/tpl] After leaving ION, the show returned to its more economical spot on WTOG.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.liveprayer.com/ddarchive3.cfm?id=2770|title=Being Faithful and Obedient to Serve the Lord|publisher=Live Prayer Daily Devotional|date=2006-12-15 |accessdate=2011-12-17[/tpl]

On November 19, 2007, Keller announced that he was suspending his television program after the telecast on Friday, November 23, after officials from ION told Keller that it will no longer carry live programming. The ministry shows on public records that the income is about $500,000 a year gross, of which is claimed to have most of the money spent on internet band width. Keller made plans to revive the show on his website as an Internet-only live call-in broadcast in January 2008.

==Controversy==

===Criticism of Mitt Romney===

On May 11, 2007, Keller wrote that "a vote for Romney is a vote for Satan" in his daily devotional because Mitt Romney is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (commonly referred to as Mormonism), an organization that he considers to be a "cult".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/06/02/evangelist_in_hot_water_over_romney_remark/|title=Evangelist in hot water over Romney remark - The Boston Globe|publisher=boston.com|accessdate=2008-12-31 | date=June 2, 2007[/tpl][ref]
