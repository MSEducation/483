[[Motorola Type II SmartZone OmniLink]]

CATEGORIES: Trunked radio systems

Type II SmartZone OmniLink is a type of Trunked radio system with multiple sites, providing a broad range of robust system features and utilizing a distributed call processing architecture linking up to four multi-site systems together into one seamless network, supporting up to 192 sites. Typical users of SmartZone OmniLink systems include organizations who have vast geographic requirements such as electric and gas utilities and extremely large public safety agencies.
Each Zone in an OmniLink network is considered its own SmartZone network, with its own unique system ID, and is controlled by its own Zone Controller. Radios can be permitted or restricted to roam from one Zone to another. The OmniLink infrastructure permits each Zone Controller to communicate and coordinate these roaming actions. (This is similar to cellular networks and roaming onto another carrier's network)
