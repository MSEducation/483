The player must quickly capture Ontama with the stylus while keeping up with the beat.

==Plot==

Taking place on a tropical island, the focus of the story are the Ontama spirits. Someone steals the Ontama by hypnotizing the island's people. Beat and Rest, the main characters, are both "Ontamaestros" and they attempt to free the Ontama by battling the islanders in musical fights.

===Storyline===

Ontama are colorful musical spirits that exist in the world of Ontamarama, a peaceful world of beauty and natural rhythm. Ontama are extremely precious to the people there because their playful nature and soothing music bring happiness to everyone; Ontamaestros devote their lives to study the Ontama and learn how to orchestrate them to make music.
A young boy and girl, Beat and Rest live on a small tropical island in this world. As childhood friends as well as friendly rivals who aspire to become famous Ontamaestros, they compete to see who will be the one to achieve their dream first. One day, on their way back home from the OntaConservatory, where they study to become Ontamaestros, Beat and Rest find a weakened Otama in the middle of the road. This surprises them because Otama rarely appear in these places. It turns out that Blast, a demon seeking power, is capturing all of the Otamas. The player picks to play as either Beat or Rest, and must play against various enemy ontamaestros who use captured Otamas.[tpl]cite web | publisher=Atlus USA | year=2007 | title=Official Ontamarama Website | url = http://www.atlus.com/ontamarama/ | work= | accessdate=February 4, 2013[/tpl]

===Characters===

Gig and Club: Club and his pet alligator, Gig, grew up together. Although Gig was too wild to be a house pet, Club found a way to calm Gig down using the music of Ontamas. The two of them are in search of an Ontama that will play music by itself without having to be conducted.
Elegy: An infernal robot created by Blast to collect the Ontamas. Elegy cannot speak but is able to fly.

Rubato: A butler who has served and raised many princes in the demonic realm. He follows Blast in order to keep an eye on him.
Blast: A prince of demons who yearns for greater power because he is insecure about his short stature and weaknesses. He escaped to the human world in order to gather Ontama to strengthen his powers.

==Gameplay==

Ontamarama's gameplay is a combination of games like Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) and Elite Beat Agents. The player must hit a D-pad direction as it passes through a circle, similar to DDR, but with the stylus. Each arrow has a color and will only register if enough colored energy is stored. To store energy, the player must touch colored Ontama that move across the touch screen. Black Ontama's may appear and block the colored ones, and some Ontama need to be touched twice. Blowing into the microphone allows the player to clear the screen of all Ontama, but this can only be used a limited amount of times.
The player should focus on clearing all the Ontamas on the screen. Ontama can be freed by tapping them with the stylus or drawing a circle around a group of Ontama of the same color. The player can also hold or swing Otama to clear them. Points are rewarded when Ontama are freed. However, Black Ontamas penalize the player for clearing them. Chains and bonus multipliers increase the score. For example, three Ontama cleared in a row gives the player a 3x multiplier. Once an Otama is freed, it fills its corresponding colored note, which corresponds to an arrow on the control pad that must be pressed at the time when it reaches the circle at the end. Hold notes require the player to press the button down at the start of the note and release it at the end of the note. Depending on the player's timing, a score (Good/Great/Master) is added to the overall performance score.
There is a performance gauge that indicates how well the player is doing. The player will have to replay the song if performance falls to zero.[tpl]cite web | last=Wang | first=Bo (Anjelous) | year=2007 | title=Ontamarama: FAQ | url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/ds/941964-ontamarama/faqs/50786 | accessdate=February 4, 2013[/tpl]
In addition to gameplay, Ontama Points can be used to buy items from the shop.

==Development==

According to Atlus USA, Ontamarama was a worthy project for them to take on because "it stood out as a lively and fun game that is easy to learn, yet challenging to master."
The North American version of the game has almost all the same songs as the Japanese release. However, a few songs had to be dropped due to licensing issues.
