In the United States, about 6% of men and 18% of women get a migraine in a given year, with a lifetime risk of about 18% and 43% respectively. In Europe, migraines affect 12–28% of people at some point in their lives with about 6–15% of adult men and 14–35% of adult women getting at least one yearly. Rates of migraines are slightly lower in Asia and Africa than in Western countries.The Headaches, pp. 238–40[tpl]Cite journal|author=Wang SJ |title=Epidemiology of migraine and other types of headache in Asia |journal=Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=104–8 |year=2003|pmid=12583837| doi = 10.1007/s11910-003-0060-7[/tpl] Chronic migraines occur in approximately 1.4 to 2.2% of the population.[tpl]cite journal|last=Natoli|first=JL|coauthors=Manack, A; Dean, B; Butler, Q; Turkel, CC; Stovner, L; Lipton, RB|title=Global prevalence of chronic migraine: a systematic review|journal=Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache|date=May 2010|volume=30|issue=5|pages=599–609|pmid=19614702|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2982.2009.01941.x[/tpl]
These figures vary substantially with age: migraines most commonly start between 15 and 24 years of age and occur most frequently in those 35 to 45 years of age.

==History==

An early description consistent with migraines is contained in the Ebers papyrus, written around 1500 BCE in ancient Egypt.[tpl]cite book|last=Miller|first=Neil|title=Walsh and Hoyt's clinical neuro-ophthalmology.|year=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=9780781748117|pages=1275|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=9RA2ZOPRuhgC&pg=PA1275|edition=6[/tpl] In 200 BCE, writings from the Hippocratic school of medicine described the visual aura that can precede the headache and a partial relief occurring through vomiting.[tpl]cite book|last=Borsook|first=David|title=The migraine brain : imaging, structure, and function|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780199754564|pages=3–11|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=5GVVJS_fCAkC&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3[/tpl] thumb|left|A trepanated skull, from the Neolithic. The perimeter of the hole in the skull is rounded off by ingrowth of new bony tissue, indicating that the person survived the operation. A second-century description by Aretaeus of Cappadocia divided headaches into three types: cephalalgia, cephalea, and heterocrania.[tpl]cite book|last=Waldman|first=by Steven D.|title=Pain management|year=2011|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9781437736038|pages=2122–2124|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=O6AojTbeXoEC&pg=PT2122&lpg=PT2122|edition=2[/tpl] Galen of Pergamon used the term hemicrania (half-head), from which the word migraine was eventually derived. He also proposed that the pain arose from the meninges and blood vessels of the head. Migraines were first divided into the two now used types - migraine with aura (migraine ophthalmique) and migraine without aura (migraine vulgaire) in 1887 by Louis Hyacinthe Thomas, a French Librarian.
Trepanation, the deliberate drilling of holes into a skull, was practiced as early as 7,000 BCE. While sometimes people survived, many would have died from the procedure due to infection.[tpl]cite book|last=Mays|first=eds.

While many treatments for migraines have been attempted, it was not until 1868 that use of a substance which eventually turned out to be effective began. This substance was the fungus ergot from which ergotamine was isolated in 1918.[tpl]cite journal|last=Tfelt-Hansen|first=PC|coauthors=Koehler, PJ|title=One hundred years of migraine research: major clinical and scientific observations from 1910 to 2010|journal=Headache|date=May 2011|volume=51|issue=5|pages=752–78|pmid=21521208|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2011.01892.x[/tpl] Methysergide was developed in 1959 and the first triptan, sumatriptan, was developed in 1988. During the 20th century with better study design effective preventative measures were found and confirmed.

==Society and culture==

Migraines are a significant source of both medical costs and lost productivity. It has been estimated that they are the most costly neurological disorder in the European Community, costing more than €27 billion per year.[tpl]cite journal|last=Stovner|first=LJ|coauthors=Andrée, C; Eurolight Steering, Committee|title=Impact of headache in Europe: a review for the Eurolight project|journal=The journal of headache and pain|date=June 2008|volume=9|issue=3|pages=139–46|pmid=18418547|doi=10.1007/s10194-008-0038-6|pmc=2386850[/tpl] In the United States direct costs have been estimated at $17 billion,[tpl]cite journal|last=Mennini|first=FS|coauthors=Gitto, L; Martelletti, P|title=Improving care through health economics analyses: cost of illness and headache|journal=The journal of headache and pain|date=August 2008|volume=9|issue=4|pages=199–206|pmid=18604472|doi=10.1007/s10194-008-0051-9|pmc=3451939[/tpl] Nearly a tenth of this cost is due to the cost of triptans. including $15 billion in indirect costs, of which missed work is the greatest component. In those who do attend work with a migraine, effectiveness is decreased by around a third. Negative impacts also frequently occur for a person's family.

==Research==

Calcitonin gene related peptides (CGRPs) have been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of the pain associated with migraine. CGRP receptor antagonists, such as olcegepant and telcagepant, have been investigated both in vitro and in clinical studies for the treatment of migraine.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Tepper SJ, Stillman MJ |title=Clinical and preclinical rationale for CGRP-receptor antagonists in the treatment of migraine |journal=Headache |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=1259–68 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18808506 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2008.01214.x [/tpl] In 2011, Merck stopped phase III clinical trials for their investigational drug telcagepant.[tpl]cite web|last=Merck & Co., Inc.|title=SEC Annual Report, Fiscal Year Ending Dec 31, 2011|url=http://www.merck.com/investors/financials/form-10-k-2011.pdf|publisher=SEC|accessdate=21 May 2012|page=65|date=February 28, 2012|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01315847|Position Emission Tomography Study of Brain CGRP Receptors After MK-0974 Administration (MK-0974-067 AM1)[/tpl] Transcranial magnetic stimulation shows promise[tpl]cite journal|last=Magis|first=D|coauthors=Jensen, R; Schoenen, J|title=Neurostimulation therapies for primary headache disorders: present and future.|journal=Current opinion in neurology|date=June 2012|volume=25|issue=3|pages=269–76|pmid=22543428|doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e3283532023[/tpl] as has transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Jürgens|first=TP|coauthors=Leone, M|title=Pearls and pitfalls: neurostimulation in headache.|journal=Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache|date=Jun 2013|volume=33|issue=8|pages=512–25|pmid=23671249|doi=10.1177/0333102413483933[/tpl]
