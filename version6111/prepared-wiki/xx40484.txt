[[El Reencuentro]]

CATEGORIES: Puerto Rican musical groups, Menudo (band)

 
 
El Reencuentro was the name that six ex-members of famous group Menudo used for their comeback concert remembering Menudo's Golden Era. Ricky Melendez, Rene Farrait, Miguel Cancel, Johnny Lozada, Ray Reyes and Charlie Masso re-joined to celebrate the 15th Anniversary of their success in Latin America, North America, Spain and several other countries in the world.  They started in 1998 as an experimental project and they had an unexpected success they continued until 2000 through North and Latin America. As of 2013, El Reencuentro continues to perform. 
The group could not use the name Menudo because Edgardo Diaz threatened to take legal action if they did.
