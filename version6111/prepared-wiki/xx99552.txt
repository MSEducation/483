Toxteth Dock was a dock, on the River Mersey and part of the Port of Liverpool. Situated in the southern dock system, it was connected to Brunswick Dock to the north and Harrington Dock to the south. It was built by George Fosbery Lyster and opened in 1841.
The dock closed in 1972 and has since been filled in. Most of the dock buildings still exist and are split up into small business units as part of Brunswick Business Park.
