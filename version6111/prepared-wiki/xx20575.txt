[[Wavelet]]

CATEGORIES: Wavelets, Time–frequency analysis, Signal processing

A wavelet is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero, increases, and then decreases back to zero. It can typically be visualized as a "brief oscillation" like one might see recorded by a seismograph or heart monitor. Generally, wavelets are purposefully crafted to have specific properties that make them useful for signal processing. Wavelets can be combined, using a "reverse, shift, multiply and integrate" technique called convolution, with portions of a known signal to extract information from the unknown signal.
For example, a wavelet could be created to have a frequency of Middle C and a short duration of roughly a 32nd note. If this wavelet was to be convolved with a signal created from the recording of a song, then the resulting signal would be useful for determining when the Middle C note was being played in the song. Mathematically, the wavelet will correlate with the signal if the unknown signal contains information of similar frequency. This concept of correlation is at the core of many practical applications of wavelet theory.
As a mathematical tool, wavelets can be used to extract information from many different kinds of data, including – but certainly not limited to – audio signals and images. Sets of wavelets are generally needed to analyze data fully. A set of "complementary" wavelets will decompose data without gaps or overlap so that the decomposition process is mathematically reversible. Thus, sets of complementary wavelets are useful in wavelet based compression/decompression algorithms where it is desirable to recover the original information with minimal loss.
In formal terms, this representation is a wavelet series representation of a square-integrable function with respect to either a complete, orthonormal set of basis functions, or an overcomplete set or frame of a vector space, for the Hilbert space of square integrable functions.

==Name==

The word wavelet has been used for decades in digital signal processing and exploration geophysics.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Ricker |first1=Norman |year=1953 |title=WAVELET CONTRACTION, WAVELET EXPANSION, AND THE CONTROL OF SEISMIC RESOLUTION |journal=Geophysics |volume= 18|issue= 4 |doi=10.1190/1.1437927[/tpl] The equivalent French word ondelette meaning "small wave" was used by Morlet and Grossmann in the early 1980s.

==Wavelet theory==

Wavelet theory is applicable to several subjects. All wavelet transforms may be considered forms of time-frequency representation for continuous-time (analog) signals and so are related to harmonic analysis. Almost all practically useful discrete wavelet transforms use discrete-time filterbanks.  These filter banks are called the wavelet and scaling coefficients in wavelets nomenclature.  These filterbanks may contain either finite impulse response (FIR) or infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. The wavelets forming a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) are subject to the uncertainty principle of Fourier analysis respective sampling theory: Given a signal with some event in it, one cannot assign simultaneously an exact time and frequency response scale to that event. The product of the uncertainties of time and frequency response scale has a lower bound. Thus, in the scaleogram of a continuous wavelet transform of this signal, such an event marks an entire region in the time-scale plane, instead of just one point. Also, discrete wavelet bases may be considered in the context of other forms of the uncertainty principle.
Wavelet transforms are broadly divided into three classes: continuous, discrete and multiresolution-based.

===Continuous wavelet transforms (continuous shift and scale parameters)===

In continuous wavelet transforms, a given signal of finite energy is projected on a continuous family of frequency bands (or similar subspaces of the Lp function space L2(R) ). For instance the signal may be represented on every frequency band of the form 2f for all positive frequencies f > 0. Then, the original signal can be reconstructed by a suitable integration over all the resulting frequency components.
The frequency bands or subspaces (sub-bands) are scaled versions of a subspace at scale 1. This subspace in turn is in most situations generated by the shifts of one generating function ψ in L2(R), the mother wavelet. For the example of the scale one frequency band 2 this function is
with the (normalized) sinc function. That, Meyer's, and two other examples of mother wavelets are:
The subspace of scale a or frequency band 2/a is generated by the functions (sometimes called child wavelets)
where a is positive and defines the scale and b is any real number and defines the shift. The pair (a, b) defines a point in the right halfplane R+ × R.
The projection of a function x onto the subspace of scale a then has the form
with wavelet coefficients
See a list of some Continuous wavelets.
For the analysis of the signal x, one can assemble the wavelet coefficients into a scaleogram of the signal.

===Discrete wavelet transforms (discrete shift and scale parameters)===

It is computationally impossible to analyze a signal using all wavelet coefficients, so one may wonder if it is sufficient to pick a discrete subset of the upper halfplane to be able to reconstruct a signal from the corresponding wavelet coefficients. One such system is the affine system for some real parameters a > 1, b > 0. The corresponding discrete subset of the halfplane consists of all the points (am, namb) with m, n in Z. The corresponding baby wavelets are now given as
A sufficient condition for the reconstruction of any signal x of finite energy by the formula

===Multiresolution based discrete wavelet transforms===

In any discretised wavelet transform, there are only a finite number of wavelet coefficients for each bounded rectangular region in the upper halfplane. Still, each coefficient requires the evaluation of an integral. In special situations this numerical complexity can be avoided if the scaled and shifted wavelets form a multiresolution analysis. This means that there has to exist an auxiliary function, the father wavelet φ in L2(R), and that a is an integer. A typical choice is a = 2 and b = 1. The most famous pair of father and mother wavelets is the Daubechies 4-tap wavelet. Note that not every orthonormal discrete wavelet basis can be associated to a multiresolution analysis; for example, the Journe  wavelet admits no multiresolution analysis.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Larson |first1=David R. |year=2007 |title= Wavelet Analysis and Applications|chapter=Unitary systems and wavelet sets |series = Appl. Numer. Harmon. Anal. |publisher=Birkhäuser|pages=143–171[/tpl]
From the mother and father wavelets one constructs the subspaces
From these it is required that the sequence
In analogy to the sampling theorem one may conclude that the space Vm with sampling distance 2m more or less covers the frequency baseband from 0 to 2−m-1. As orthogonal complement, Wm roughly covers the band 2−m.
The second identity of the first pair is a refinement equation for the father wavelet φ. Both pairs of identities form the basis for the algorithm of the fast wavelet transform.
From the multiresolution analysis derives the orthogonal decomposition of the space L2 as
where the coefficients are

==Mother wavelet==

Being in this space ensures that one can formulate the conditions of zero mean and square norm one:
For ψ to be a wavelet for the continuous wavelet transform (see there for exact statement), the mother wavelet must satisfy an admissibility criterion (loosely speaking, a kind of half-differentiability) in order to get a stably invertible transform.
For the discrete wavelet transform, one needs at least the condition that the wavelet series is a representation of the identity in the space L2(R). Most constructions of discrete WT make use of the multiresolution analysis, which defines the wavelet by a scaling function. This scaling function itself is solution to a functional equation.
In most situations it is useful to restrict ψ to be a continuous function with a higher number M of vanishing moments, i.e. for all integer m The mother wavelet is scaled (or dilated) by a factor of a and translated (or shifted) by a factor of b to give (under Morlet's original formulation):
For the continuous WT, the pair (a,b) varies over the full half-plane R+ × R; for the discrete WT this pair varies over a discrete subset of it, which is also called affine group.
These functions are often incorrectly referred to as the basis functions of the (continuous) transform. In fact, as in the continuous Fourier transform, there is no basis in the continuous wavelet transform. Time-frequency interpretation uses a subtly different formulation (after Delprat).

==Comparisons with Fourier transform (continuous-time)==

The wavelet transform is often compared with the Fourier transform, in which signals are represented as a sum of sinusoids.  In fact, the Fourier transform can be viewed as a special case of the continuous wavelet transform with the choice of the mother wavelet 
The main difference in general is that wavelets are localized in both time and frequency whereas the standard Fourier transform is only localized in frequency.  The Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is similar to the wavelet transform, in that it is also time and frequency localized, but there are issues with the frequency/time resolution trade-off.
In particular, assuming a rectangular window region, one may think of the STFT as a transform with a slightly different kernel
From this, the square of the temporal support of the window offset by time u is given by
A given resolution cell’s time-bandwidth product may not be exceeded with the STFT.   All STFT basis elements maintain a uniform spectral and temporal support for all temporal shifts or offsets, thereby attaining an equal resolution in time for lower and higher frequencies.  The resolution is purely determined by the sampling width.
In contrast, the wavelet transform’s multiresolutional properties enables large temporal supports for lower frequencies while maintaining short temporal widths for higher frequencies by the scaling properties of the wavelet transform.  This property extends conventional time-frequency analysis into time-scale analysis.Mallat, Stephane. "A wavelet tour of signal processing. 1998." 250-252.thumb|STFT time-frequency atoms (left) and DWT time-scale atoms (right).  The time-frequency atoms are four different basis functions used for the STFT (i.e. four separate Fourier transforms required).  The time-scale atoms of the DWT achieve small temporal widths for high frequencies and good temporal widths for low frequencies with a single transform basis set.
The discrete wavelet transform is less computationally complex, taking O(N) time as compared to O(N log N) for the fast Fourier transform.  This computational advantage is not inherent to the transform, but reflects the choice of a logarithmic division of frequency, in contrast to the equally spaced frequency divisions of the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) which uses the same basis functions as DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform).The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing By Steven W. Smith, Ph.D. chapter 8 equation 8-1: http://www.dspguide.com/ch8/4.htm It is also important to note that this complexity only applies when the filter size has no relation to the signal size. A wavelet without compact support such as the Shannon wavelet would require O(N2). (For instance, a logarithmic Fourier Transform also exists with O(N) complexity, but the original signal must be sampled logarithmically in time, which is only useful for certain types of signals.http://homepages.dias.ie/~ajones/publications/28.pdf)

==Definition of a wavelet==

There are a number of ways of defining a wavelet (or a wavelet family).

===Scaling filter===

An orthogonal wavelet is entirely defined by the scaling filter – a low-pass finite impulse response (FIR) filter of length 2N and sum 1.  In biorthogonal wavelets, separate decomposition and reconstruction filters are defined.
For analysis with orthogonal wavelets the high pass filter is calculated as the quadrature mirror filter of the low pass, and reconstruction filters are the time reverse of the decomposition filters.
Daubechies and Symlet wavelets can be defined by the scaling filter.

===Scaling function===

Wavelets are defined by the wavelet function ψ(t) (i.e. the mother wavelet) and scaling function φ(t) (also called father wavelet) in the time domain.
The wavelet function is in effect a band-pass filter and scaling it for each level halves its bandwidth.  This creates the problem that in order to cover the entire spectrum, an infinite number of levels would be required.  The scaling function filters the lowest level of the transform and ensures all the spectrum is covered.  See http://www.polyvalens.com/blog/?page_id=15#7.+The+scaling+function+%5B7%5D for a detailed explanation.
For a wavelet with compact support, φ(t) can be considered finite in length and is equivalent to the scaling filter g.
Meyer wavelets can be defined by scaling functions

===Wavelet function===

The wavelet only has a time domain representation as the wavelet function ψ(t).
For instance, Mexican hat wavelets can be defined by a wavelet function. See a list of a few Continuous wavelets.

==History==

The development of wavelets can be linked to several separate trains of thought, starting with Haar's work in the early 20th century. Later work by Dennis Gabor yielded Gabor atoms (1946), which are constructed similarly to wavelets, and applied to similar purposes. Notable contributions to wavelet theory can be attributed to Zweig’s discovery of the continuous wavelet transform in 1975 (originally called the cochlear transform and discovered while studying the reaction of the ear to sound),[ref]http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Zweig.html
