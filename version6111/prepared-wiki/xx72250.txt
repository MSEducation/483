Bare-knuckle boxing (also known as bare-knuckle, prizefighting, or fisticuffs) is the original form of boxing, closely related to ancient combat sports. It involves two individuals fighting without boxing gloves or other padding on their hands.
The difference between a streetfight and a bare-knuckle boxing match is an accepted set of rules, such as not striking a downed opponent.

==Irish Stand Down==

"Irish Stand Down" is a term for a type of traditional bare knuckle fighting where the aspect of maneuvering around the ring is removed, leaving only the less nuanced aspects of punching and "taking" punches. This form of combat was popular in Irish American ghettos in the United States in the late 19th century but was eclipsed in the Irish American community first by bare knuckle boxing and then later by regulation boxing. The Irish Stand Down is also known as strap fighting or toe to toe.

==Modern Bare Knuckle Boxing==
