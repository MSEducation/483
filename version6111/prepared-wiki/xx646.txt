Croatia ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Croatia.ogg|k|r|oʊ|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ə[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-hr|Hrvatska[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-sh|xř̩ʋaːtskaː|pron[/tpl]), officially the Republic of Croatia ([tpl]lang-hr|Republika Hrvatska[/tpl] [tpl]Audio|Republika_Hrvatska.ogg|listen[/tpl]), is a unitary democratic parliamentary republic at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital and largest city is Zagreb. The country is divided into 20 counties and the city of Zagreb. Croatia covers [tpl]convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off[/tpl] and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism.  
The Croats arrived in the area of present-day Croatia during the early part of the 7th century AD. They organised the state into two duchies by the 9th century. Tomislav became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom. The Kingdom of Croatia retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries, reaching its peak during the rule of Kings Peter Krešimir IV and Dmitar Zvonimir. Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102. In 1527, faced with Ottoman conquest, the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg to the Croatian throne. In 1918, after World War I, Croatia was included in the unrecognised State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs which seceded from Austria–Hungary and merged into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. A fascist Croatian puppet state existed during World War II. After the war, Croatia became a founding member and a federal constituent of Second Yugoslavia, a socialist state. In June 1991, Croatia declared independence, which came into effect on 8 October of the same year. The Croatian War of Independence was fought successfully during the four years following the declaration.
Croatia today has a very high Human Development Index. The International Monetary Fund classified Croatia as an emerging and developing economy, and the World Bank identified it as a high income economy. Croatia is a member of the European Union, United Nations, the Council of Europe, NATO, the World Trade Organization and a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean. As an active participant in the UN peacekeeping forces, Croatia has contributed troops to the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan and took a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2008–2009 term.
The service sector dominates Croatia's economy, followed by the industrial sector and agriculture. Tourism is a significant source of revenue during the summer, with Croatia ranked the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world. The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government expenditure. The European Union is Croatia's most important trading partner. Since 2000, the Croatian government has invested in infrastructure, especially transport routes and facilities along the Pan-European corridors. Internal sources produce a significant portion of energy in Croatia; the rest is imported. Croatia provides a universal health care system and free primary and secondary education, while supporting culture through numerous public institutions and through corporate investments in media and publishing.

==Etymology==

The name of Croatia derives from Medieval Latin Croātia – compare DUX CRUATORVM [tpl]sic[/tpl] ("Duke of the Croats") attested in the Branimir inscription –, itself a derivation of North-West Slavic *Xrovat-, by liquid metathesis from proposed Common Slavic period *Xorvat-, from proposed Proto-Slavic *Xarwāt- (*Xъrvatъ) or *Xŭrvatŭ (*xъrvatъ).[tpl]cite book|author=Alemko Gluhak|title=Hrvatski etimološki rječnik|trans_title=Croatian Etymological Dictionary|language=Croatian|publisher=August Cesarec|year=1993|isbn=953-162-000-8[/tpl]
The origin of the name is uncertain, but is thought to be a Gothic or Indo-Aryan term assigned to a Slavic tribe.[tpl]cite web| publisher=University of Kansas| author= Marc L.

The first attestation of the Latin term is attributed to a charter of duke Trpimir from the year 852. The original is lost, and just a 1568 copy is preserved—leading to doubts on the authenticity of the claim.Mužić (2007), p. 27 The oldest preserved stone inscription is the 9th-century Branimir Inscription (found near Benkovac), where Duke Branimir is styled as Dux Cruatorvm. The inscription is not dated accurately, however, Branimir ruled Croatia in 879–892.Mužić (2007), pp. 195–198

The area known as Croatia today was inhabited throughout the prehistoric period.

The ethnogenesis of Croats is uncertain and there are several competing theories, Slavic and Iranian being the most frequently put forward. The most widely accepted of these, the Slavic theory, proposes migration of White Croats from the territory of White Croatia during the Migration Period. Conversely, the Iranian theory proposes Iranian origin, based on Tanais Tablets containing Greek inscription of given names Χορούαθος, Χοροάθος and Χορόαθος (Khoroúathos, Khoroáthos, and Khoróathos) and their interpretation as anthroponyms of Croatian people.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Migracijske i etničke teme|issn= 1333-2546|publisher=Institute for Migration and Ethnic Studies|date=September 2007|volume=23|issue=3|pages=251–268|author1=Emil Heršak|author2=Boris Nikšić|language=Croatian|title=Hrvatska etnogeneza: pregled komponentnih etapa i interpretacija (s naglaskom na euroazijske/nomadske sadržaje)|trans_title=Croatian Ethnogenesis: A Review of Component Stages and Interpretations (with Emphasis on Eurasian/Nomadic Elements) | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=28729&lang=en[/tpl]

===Middle Ages===

According to the work De Administrando Imperio written by the 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, the Croats had arrived in what is today Croatia in the early 7th century, however that claim is disputed and competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries.Mužić (2007), pp. 249–293 Eventually two dukedoms were formed—Duchy of Pannonia and Duchy of Dalmatia, ruled by Ljudevit Posavski and Borna, as attested by chronicles of Einhard starting in 818. The record represents the first document of Croatian realms, vassal states of Francia at the time.Mužić (2007), pp. 157–160
The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of Mislav two decades later.Mužić (2007), pp. 169–170 According to the Constantine VII Christianization of Croats began in the 7th century, but the claim is disputed and generally Christianization is associated with the 9th century.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Bogoslovska smotra|publisher=University of Zagreb, Catholic Faculty of Theology|issn=0352-3101|date=April 1968|issue=3–4|volume=37|author=Antun Ivandija|title=Pokrštenje Hrvata prema najnovijim znanstvenim rezultatima|trans_title=Christianization of Croats according to the most recent scientific results|language=Croatian|pages=440–444 | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=64623&lang=en[/tpl] The first native Croatian ruler recognised by the Pope was duke Branimir, whom Pope John VIII referred to as Dux Croatorum ("Duke of Croats") in 879.
Tomislav was the first ruler of Croatia who was styled a king in a letter from the Pope John X, dating kingdom of Croatia to year 925. Tomislav defeated Hungarian and Bulgarian invasions, spreading the influence of Croatian kings.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Radovi Zavoda za hrvatsku povijest|volume=30|issue=1|issn=0353-295X|pages=281–290|title=Povijesni zemljovidi i granice Hrvatske u Tomislavovo doba|trans_title= Historical maps and borders of Croatia in age of Tomislav|language=Croatian|author=Vladimir Posavec|date=March 1998|accessdate=16 October 2011|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=62779[/tpl] The medieval Croatian kingdom reached its peak in the 11th century during the reigns of Petar Krešimir IV (1058–1074) and Dmitar Zvonimir (1075–1089).[tpl]cite journal|journal=Radovi Zavoda za hrvatsku povijest|volume=29|issue=1|issn=0353-295X|pages=11–20|title=Regnum Croatiae et Dalmatiae u doba Stjepana II.|trans_title=Regnum Croatiae et Dalmatiae in age of Stjepan II|language=Croatian|author=Lujo Margetić|date=January 1997|accessdate=16 October 2011|url= http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=76963[/tpl] When Stjepan II died in 1091 ending the Trpimirović dynasty, Ladislaus I of Hungary claimed Croatian crown.

For the next four centuries, the Kingdom of Croatia was ruled by the Sabor (parliament) and a Ban (viceroy) appointed by the king.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=404|title=Povijest saborovanja|trans_title=History of parliamentarism|language=Croatian|publisher=Sabor|accessdate=18 October 2010|archivedate=26 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69Qkc8832[/tpl] The period saw increasing threat of Ottoman conquest and struggle against the Republic of Venice for control of coastal areas. The Venetians gained control over most of Dalmatia by 1428, with exception of the city-state of Dubrovnik which became independent. Ottoman conquests led to the 1493 Battle of Krbava field and 1526 Battle of Mohács, both ending in decisive Ottoman victories. King Louis II died at Mohács, and in 1527, the Croatian Parliament met in Cetin and chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as new ruler of Croatia, under the condition that he provide protection to Croatia against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights.Frucht 2005, p. 422–423 This period saw the rise of influential nobility such as the Frankopan and Zrinski families to prominence and ultimately numerous Bans from the two families.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Povijesni prilozi|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=13778|issn=0351-9767|publisher=Croatian Institute of History|date=July 2005|volume=28|issue=28|pages=7–22|author=Márta Font|title=Ugarsko Kraljevstvo i Hrvatska u srednjem vijeku|language=Croatian|trans_title=Hungarian Kingdom and Croatia in the Middlea Ages|accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl] In practice Croatia was a free and independent kingdom only from 910 till 1102.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.fr/books?hl=fr&id=T_1bA7hj3lcC&dq=kotor+Southern+Dalmatia+google+books&q=dalmatia |title=Carol Greene, Yugoslavia, Children Press 1960 - Page 60 |publisher=Books.google.fr |date=12 January 1935 |accessdate=6 October 2013[/tpl]

===Habsburg Monarchy and Austria-Hungary (1538–1918)===

Following the decisive Ottoman victories, Croatia was split into civilian and military territories, with the partition formed in 1538. The military territories would become known as the Croatian Military Frontier and were under direct Imperial control. Ottoman advances in the Croatian territory continued until the 1593 Battle of Sisak, the first decisive Ottoman defeat, and stabilisation of borders.
During the Great Turkish War (1667–1698), Slavonia was regained but western Bosnia, which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, remained outside Croatian control. The present-day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome. Dalmatia, the southern part of the border, was similarly defined by the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars.Lane (1973), p. 409
The Ottoman wars instigated great demographic changes. Croats migrated towards Austria and the present-day Burgenland Croats are direct descendants of these settlers.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Croatian Cultural Association in Burgenland|url=http://www.hkd.at/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61&Itemid=102&lang=hr|language=Croatian|title=Povijest Gradišćanskih Hrvatov|trans_title=History of Burgenland Croats|accessdate=17 October 2011|archivedate=26 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69Qku2uNT[/tpl] To replace the fleeing population the Habsburgs encouraged the Christian populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier.

Between 1797 and 1809 the First French Empire gradually occupied the entire eastern Adriatic coastline and a substantial part of its hinterland, ending the Venetian and the Ragusan republics, establishing the Illyrian Provinces. In response the Royal Navy started the blockade of the Adriatic Sea leading to the Battle of Vis in 1811.Adkins, pp. 359–362 The Illyrian Provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813, and absorbed by the Austrian Empire following the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This led to formation of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and restoration of the Croatian Littoral to the Kingdom of Croatia, now both under the same crown.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZTC3IWC_py8C|author=Harold Nicolson|title=The Congress of Vienna: A Study in Allied Unity: 1812–1822|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=978-0-8021-3744-9|page=180|year=2000|accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl]
The 1830s and 1840s saw romantic nationalism inspire the Croatian National Revival, a political and cultural campaign advocating the unity of all South Slavs in the empire.

By the 1860s, failure of the policy became apparent, leading to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and creation of a personal union between the crowns of the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary. The treaty left the issue of Croatia's status to Hungary, and the status was resolved by the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement of 1868, when kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia were united.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~habsweb/sourcetexts/nagodba1.htm|title=Constitution of Union between Croatia-Slavonia and Hungary|publisher=H-net.org|accessdate=16 May 2010[/tpl] The Kingdom of Dalmatia remained under de facto Austrian control, while Rijeka retained the status of Corpus separatum introduced in 1779.

In April 1941, Yugoslavia was occupied by Germany and Italy. Following the invasion the territory, parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the region of Syrmia were incorporated into the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a Nazi-backed puppet state. Parts of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy and the northern Croatian regions of Baranja and Međimurje were annexed by Hungary.Klemenčić, Žagar 2004, p. 153–156 The NDH regime was led by Ante Pavelić and ultranationalist Ustaše.

==Geography==

Croatia is located in Central and Southeast Europe, bordering Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the southeast,  Montenegro to the southeast, the Adriatic Sea to the southwest and Slovenia to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 13° and 20° E. Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave connected to the rest of the mainland by territorial waters, but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around Neum.
The territory covers [tpl]convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off[/tpl], consisting of [tpl]convert|56414|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off[/tpl] of land and [tpl]convert|128|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off[/tpl] of water. It is the 127th largest country in the world. Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Dinaric Alps with the highest point of the Dinara peak at [tpl]convert|1831|m|ft|abbr=off[/tpl] near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the south to the shore of the Adriatic Sea which makes up its entire southwest border. Insular Croatia consists of over a thousand islands and islets varying in size, 48 of which are permanently inhabited. The largest islands are Cres and Krk, each of them having an area of around [tpl]convert|405|km2|abbr=off[/tpl].
The hilly northern parts of Hrvatsko Zagorje and the flat plains of Slavonia in the east (which is part of the Pannonian Basin) are traversed by major rivers such as Sava, Drava, Kupa and Danube. The Danube, Europe's second longest river, runs through the city of Vukovar in the extreme east and forms part of the border with Serbia. The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands. Natural resources found in the country in quantities significant enough for production include oil, coal, bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, silica, mica, clays, salt and hydropower.
Karst topography makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geografija.hr/clanci/1011/rasirenost-krsa-u-hrvatskoj|title=Raširenost krša u Hrvatskoj|trans_title=Presence of Karst in Croatia|language=Croatian|publisher=Croatian Geographic Society|date=18 December 2006|author=Mate Matas|accessdate=18 October 2011|work=geografija.hr|archivedate=8 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69lbXToZS[/tpl] There are a number of deep caves in Croatia, 49 of which are deeper than [tpl]convert|250|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl], 14 of them deeper than [tpl]convert|500|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl] and three deeper than [tpl]convert|1000|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl]. Croatia's most famous lakes are the Plitvice lakes, a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over dolomite and limestone cascades. The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours, ranging from turquoise to mint green, grey or blue.[tpl]cite web|publisher=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20110617-the-best-national-parks-of-europe|title=The best national parks of Europe|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=11 October 2011|archivedate=4 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69fOQEt30[/tpl]

===Climate===

Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy continental climate as defined by the Köppen climate classification. Mean monthly temperature ranges between [tpl]convert|-3|°C|°F|lk=on[/tpl] (in January) and [tpl]convert|18|°C|°F|lk=off[/tpl] (in July). The coldest parts of the country are Lika and Gorski Kotar where snowy forested climate is found at elevations above [tpl]convert|1200|m|ft|abbr=off[/tpl]. The warmest areas of Croatia are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland characterised by the Mediterranean climate, as the temperature highs are moderated by the sea. Consequently, temperature peaks are more pronounced in the continental areas—the lowest temperature of [tpl]convert|-35.5|°C|°F|lk=off[/tpl] was recorded on 3 February 1919 in Čakovec, and the highest temperature of [tpl]convert|42.4|°C|°F|lk=off[/tpl] was recorded on 5 July 1950 in Karlovac.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Croatian Bureau of Statistics|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/ljetopis/2010/SLJH2010.pdf|format= PDF|title=2010 – Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Croatia|date=December 2010|accessdate=7 October 2011[/tpl]
Mean annual precipitation ranges between [tpl]convert|600|mm|in|abbr=off[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|3500|mm|in|abbr=off[/tpl] depending on geographic region and prevailing climate type. The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands (Vis, Lastovo, Biševo, Svetac) and in the eastern parts of Slavonia, however in the latter case, it is mostly occurring during the growing season. The maximum precipitation levels are observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski kotar.
Prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest, and in the coastal area prevailing winds are determined by local area features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as bura or less frequently as sirocco. The sunniest parts of the country are the outer islands, Hvar and Korčula, where more than 2700 hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the southern Adriatic Sea area in general, northern Adriatic coast, and Slavonia, all with more than 2000 hours of sunshine per year.

===Biodiversity===

Croatia can be subdivided between a number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology, and the country is consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia—Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas. One of the most significant are karst habitats which include submerged karst, such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats. The karst geology harbours approximately 7,000 caves and pits, some of which are habitat of the only known aquatic cave vertebrate—the olm. Forests are also significantly present in the country, as they cover [tpl]convert|2490000|ha|abbr=off[/tpl] representing 44% of Croatian land surface. The other habitat types include wetlands, grasslands, bogs, fens, scrub habitats, coastal and marine habitats.[tpl]cite book|publisher=State Institute for Nature Protection, Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|format=PDF|url=http://www.dzzp.hr/dokumenti_upload/20120515/dzzp201205151608230.pdf|title=Biodiversity of Croatia|year= 2006|editor=Jasminka Radović|editor2=Kristijan Čivić|editor3= Ramona Topić|isbn=953-7169-20-0|accessdate=13 October 2011[/tpl]
In terms of phytogeography, Croatia is a part of the Boreal Kingdom and is a part of Illyrian and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region and the Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region. The World Wide Fund for Nature divides Croatia between three ecoregions—Pannonian mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests.[tpl]cite web|publisher=6th Dubrovnik Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems|url=http://www.dubrovnik2011.sdewes.org/venue.php|title=Venue|accessdate=13 October 2011[/tpl]
There are 37,000 known species in Croatia, but their actual number is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000. The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia in the first half of the 2000s (decade) alone. There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.
The most serious threat to species is loss and degradation of habitats. A further problem is presented by appearance of invasive alien species, especially Caulerpa taxifolia algae. The invasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to protect the benthic habitat. Indigenous sorts of cultivated plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous. Those include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.
There are 444 protected areas of Croatia, encompassing 9% of the country. Those include eight national parks, two strict reserves, and ten nature parks. The most famous protected area and the oldest national park in Croatia is the Plitvice Lakes National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme. The strict and special reserves, as well as the national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central government, while other protected areas are managed by counties. In 2005, the National Ecological Network was set up, as the first step in preparation of the EU accession and joining of the Natura 2000 network.

==Politics==

Croatia is a unitary democratic parliamentary republic. With the collapse of the ruling communist party in SFR Yugoslavia, Croatia adopted its present constitution in 1990 and organised its first multi-party elections.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/09/world/evolution-in-europe-conservatives-win-in-croatia.html?ref=croatia|title=EVOLUTION IN EUROPE; Conservatives Win in Croatia|date=9 May 1990|accessdate=14 October 2011[/tpl] It declared independence on 8 October 1991 leading to the break-up of Yugoslavia and the country was internationally recognised by the United Nations in 1992.

The President of the Republic ([tpl]lang-hr|Predsjednik Republike[/tpl]) is the head of state, directly elected to a five-year term and is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of two terms. In addition to being the commander in chief of the armed forces, the president has the procedural duty of appointing the prime minister with the consent of the parliament, and has some influence on foreign policy. The most recent presidential elections were held on 10 January 2010, when Ivo Josipović won.

The parliament ([tpl]lang-hr|Sabor[/tpl]) is a unicameral legislative body. A second chamber, the House of Counties, set up in 1993 pursuant to the 1990 Constitution, was abolished in 2001. The number of Sabor members can vary from 100 to 160; they are all elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The sessions of the Sabor take place from 15 January to 15 July, and from 15 September to 15 December.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Sabor|url= http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=713|title=About the Parliament|accessdate=14 October 2011[/tpl] The two largest political parties in Croatia are the Croatian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Croatia.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Sabor|title= Members of the 6th Parliament|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=776|accessdate=14 October 2011[/tpl]

===Administrative divisions===

Croatia was first subdivided into counties in the Middle Ages.[tpl]cite journal |publisher=Školska knjiga |journal=Historijski zbornik |volume=5 |issue=1–2 |year=1952 |format=PDF |url=http://www.historiografija.hr/hz/1952/HZ_5_11_MANDIC.pdf |author=Oleg Mandić |language=Croatian |title=O nekim pitanjima društvenog uređenja Hrvatske u srednjem vijeku |trans_title=On some issues of social system of Croatia in the Middle Ages |pages=131–138 |accessdate=9 September 2011[/tpl] The divisions changed over time to reflect losses of territory to Ottoman conquest and subsequent liberation of the same territory, changes of political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Istria. Traditional division of the country into counties was abolished in the 1920s, when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and subsequent Kingdom of Yugoslavia introduced oblasts and banovinas respectively.Frucht 2005, pp. 429–429
Communist ruled Croatia, as a constituent part of post-WWII Yugoslavia, abolished earlier divisions and introduced municipalities, subdividing Croatia into approximately one hundred municipalities. Counties were reintroduced in 1992 legislation, significantly altered in terms of territory relative to the pre-1920s subdivisions: In 1918, the Transleithanian part of Croatia was divided into eight counties with their seats in Bjelovar, Gospić, Ogulin, Požega, Vukovar, Varaždin, Osijek and Zagreb, and the 1992 legislation established 14 counties in the same territory.Biondich 2000, p. 11[tpl]cite news |newspaper=Narodne novine |date=30 December 1992 |accessdate=9 September 2011 |language=Croatian |title=Zakon o područjima županija, gradova i općina u Republici Hrvatskoj |trans_title=Territories of Counties, Cities and Municipalities of the Republic of Croatia Act |url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1992_12_90_2333.html[/tpl]
Since the counties were re-established in 1992, Croatia is divided into 20 counties and the capital city of Zagreb, the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time. Borders of the counties changed in some instances since, with the latest revision taking place in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Narodne novine|date=28 July 2006|accessdate=9 September 2011|language=Croatian|title=Zakon o područjima županija, gradova i općina u Republici Hrvatskoj|trans_title=Territories of Counties, Cities and Municipalities of the Republic of Croatia Act|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2006_07_86_2045.html[/tpl] Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) division of Croatia is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level places the entire country in a single unit, while there are three NUTS 2 regions. Those are Northwest Croatia, Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia and Adriatic Croatia. The latter encompasses all the counties along the Adriatic coast. The Northwest Croatia includes the city of Zagreb, Zagreb, Krapina-Zagorje, Varaždin, Koprivnica-Križevci and Međimurje counties, and the Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia includes the remaining areas—Bjelovar-Bilogora, Virovitica-Podravina, Požega-Slavonia, Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Syrmia, Karlovac and Sisak-Moslavina counties. Individual counties and the city of Zagreb also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia. The NUTS Local administrative unit divisions are two-tiered. LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the city of Zagreb in effect making those the same as NUTS 3 units, while LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to the cities and municipalities of Croatia.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Council of Europe|format=PDF|language=Croatian|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/heritage/cemat/confminist1-15/15eCEMAT_National_Report_Croatia_2010_HR.pdf|title=Nacionalno izviješće Hrvatska|trans_title=Croatia National Report|date=January 2010|accessdate=25 February 2012[/tpl]

===Military===

Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) consist of the Army, Navy and Air Force branches in addition to the Education and Training Command and Support Command. The CAF is headed by the General Staff, which reports to the Defence Minister, who in turn reports to the President of Croatia. According to the constitution, the President is commander-in-chief of the armed forces and in case of immediate threat during wartime he issues orders directly to the General Staff.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.osrh.hr/prikaz_en.asp?idi=100&kati=2|title=Chain of Command in the CAF|publisher=Croatian Ministry of Defence|accessdate=2 July 2012[/tpl]
Following the 1991–95 war defence spending and CAF size have been in constant decline. As of 2005 military spending was an estimated 2.39% of the country's GDP, which placed Croatia 64th in a ranking of all countries.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/hr.html|title=World Factbook|accessdate=9 September 2011|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency[/tpl] Since 2005 the budget was kept below 2% of GDP, down from the record high of 11.1% in 1994.[tpl]cite web|url=http://milexdata.sipri.org/|title=SIPRI Military Expenditure Database|publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|accessdate=9 September 2011[/tpl] Traditionally relying on a large number of conscripts, CAF also went through a period of reforms focused on downsizing, restructuring and professionalisation in the years prior to Croatia's accession to NATO in April 2009. According to a presidential decree issued in 2006 the CAF is set to employ 18,100 active duty military personnel, 3,000 civilians and 2,000 voluntary conscripts between the ages of 18 and 30 in peacetime.
Compulsory conscription was abolished in January 2008. Until 2008 military service was compulsory for men at age 18 and conscripts served six-month tours of duty, reduced in 2001 from the earlier scheme of nine-month conscription tours. Conscientious objectors could instead opt for an eight-month civilian service.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.monitor.hr/clanci/vojni-rok-u-hrvatskoj-kraci-nego-drugdje-u-europi-i-nato-u/11191/|title=Vojni rok u Hrvatskoj kraći, nego drugdje u Europi i NATO-u|author=Milan Jelovac|date=23 January 2001|newspaper=Vjesnik|language=Croatian|accessdate=9 September 2011[/tpl]

===Tourism===

Tourism dominates the Croatian service sector and accounts for up to 20% of Croatian GDP. Annual tourist industry income for 2011 was estimated at €6.61 billion. Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy of Croatia in terms of increased business volume observed in retail business, processing industry orders and summer seasonal employment. The industry is considered an export business, because it significantly reduces the country's external trade imbalance.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Vjesnik|url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/Article.aspx?ID=D37B6CB1-C728-44FE-94C7-8C80B4EA582F|archivedate=14 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68PYhbBry|language=Croatian|title=Iako čini gotovo petinu BDP-a, i dalje niskoprofitabilna grana domaće privrede|trans_title=Even though it comprises nearly a fifth of the GDP, it is still a low-profit branch of the national economy|author1=Tomislav Pili|author2=Davor Verković|date=1 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2011[/tpl] Since the conclusion of the Croatian War of Independence, the tourist industry has grown rapidly, recording a fourfold rise in tourist numbers, with more than 10 million tourists each year.

==Demographics==

With its population of 4.28 million in 2011, Croatia ranks 125th by population in the world. Its population density stands at 75.9 inhabitants per square kilometre. The overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth is 75.7 years. The total fertility rate of 1.5 children per mother, is one of the lowest in the world. Since 1991, Croatia's death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate. Since the late 1990s, there has been a positive net migration into Croatia, reaching a level of more than 7,000 net immigrants in 2006.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Limun.hr|url=http://limun.hr/main.aspx?id=178599&NadID=178578|title=U Hrvatskoj dvostruko više doseljenika|trans_title=Twice as many immigrants in Croatia|date=21 July 2007|accessdate=12 October 2011[/tpl]

The population decrease was also a result of the Croatian War of Independence. During the war, large sections of the population were displaced and emigration increased.

Croatians are protective of their Croatian language from foreign influences, as the language was under constant change and threats imposed by previous rulers (i.e. Austrian German, Hungarian, Italian and Turkish words were changed and altered to "Slavic" looking/sounding ones). Efforts made to impose policies to alter Croatian into "Serbo-Croatian" or "South Slavic" language, met resistance from Croats in form of Croatian linguistic purism.

==Culture==

===Arts and literature===

Architecture in Croatia reflects influences of bordering nations. Austrian and Hungarian influence is visible in public spaces and buildings in the north and in the central regions, architecture found along coasts of Dalmatia and Istria exhibits Venetian influence.[tpl]cite book|title=A short history of Yugoslavia from early times to 1966|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-09531-0|author1=Stephen Clissold|author2=Henry Clifford Darby|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_G43AAAAIAAJ|year=1968|pages=51–52|accessdate=30 November 2011[/tpl] Large squares named after culture heroes, well-groomed parks, and pedestrian-only zones, are features of these orderly towns and cities, especially where large scale Baroque urban planning took place, for instance in Osijek (Tvrđa), Varaždin and Karlovac.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/croatia/10124483/Varazdin-Croatias-little-Vienna.html|title=Varaždin: Croatia's 'little Vienna'|date=17 June 2013|last=MacGregor|first=Sandra|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=4 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|newspaper=Jutarnji list|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/najljepsi-gradovi-sjeverne-hrvatske---karlovac--ozalj--ogulin/877654/| title= Najljepši gradovi Sjeverne Hrvatske – Karlovac, Ozalj, Ogulin|trans_title=The Most Beautiful Cities of the Northern Croatia – Karlovac, Ozalj, Ogulin|language=Croatian|date=14 August 2010|accessdate=10 October 2011[/tpl] Subsequent influence of the Art Nouveau was reflected in contemporary architecture.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Radovi Instituta za povijest umjetnosti|issn=0350–3437| publisher=Institute of Art History (Croatia)|format=PDF|language=Croatian|url=http://www.hart.hr/uploads/documents/354.pdf|author=Darja Radović Mahečić|title=Sekvenca secesije – arhitekt Lav Kalda|trans_title=Sequence of the Art Nouveau – Architect Lav Kalda|year=2006|volume=30|pages= 241–264|accessdate=10 October 2011[/tpl] Along the coast, the architecture is Mediterranean with a strong Venetian and Renaissance influence in major urban areas exemplified in works of Giorgio da Sebenico and Niccolò Fiorentino such as the Cathedral of St. James in Šibenik.

Besides the architecture encompassing the oldest artworks in Croatia, there is a long history of artists in Croatia reaching to the Middle Ages. In that period the stone portal of the Trogir Cathedral was made by Radovan, representing the most important monument of Romanesque sculpture in the Balkans. The Renaissance had the greatest impact on the Adriatic Sea coast since the remainder of Croatia was embroiled in the Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War. With the waning of the Ottoman Empire, art flourished during the Baroque and Rococo. The 19th and the 20th centuries brought about affirmation of numerous Croatian artisans, helped by several patrons of the arts such as bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Essehist|publisher=University of Osijek – Faculty of Philosophy|issn=1847-6236|date=September 2011|volume=2|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=95675|title=Josip Juraj Strossmayer – Rođeni Osječanin|trans_title=Josip Juraj Strossmayer – Native of Osijek|language=Croatian|pages=70–73|author=Pavao Nujić|accessdate=10 October 2011[/tpl] Croatian artists of the period achieving worldwide renown were Vlaho Bukovac and Ivan Meštrović.

===Cuisine===

Croatian traditional cuisine varies from one region to another. Dalmatia and Istria draw upon culinary influences of Italian and other Mediterranean cuisines which prominently feature various seafood, cooked vegetables and pasta, as well as condiments such as olive oil and garlic. The continental cuisine is heavily influenced by Hungarian, Austrian and Turkish culinary styles. In that area, meats, freshwater fish and vegetable dishes are predominant.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Croatian National Tourist Board|url=http://croatia.hr/en-GB/Discover-Croatia/Gastronomy-and-enology|accessdate=13 October 2011|title=Gastronomy and enology[/tpl]
There are two distinct wine-producing regions in Croatia. The continental region in the north-east of the country, especially Slavonia is capable of producing premium wines, particularly whites.
