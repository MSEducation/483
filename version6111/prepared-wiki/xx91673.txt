</ref> However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected [[Emmett Quinn]] of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria challenge was accepted.<ref>[tpl]cite news |work=Montreal Daily Mail |date=March 19, 1914 |title=A Tempest In a Teapot |page=9[/tpl]</ref><ref>[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Globe and Mail |title=Stanley Cup Muddle Cleared Up |date=March 19, 1914 |page=[/tpl]</ref> Nevertheless, the Torontos defeated Victoria in a best-of-five series played in Toronto in three straight games.

===The Livingstone era===

Quinn left the team after the Stanley Cup win to return to business and his absence was felt.[tpl]sfn|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=86[/tpl] The next season, the team fell to fourth place in the six-team NHA with a record of 8 wins and 12 losses (down from 13 wins and 7 losses). 
Before the 1915–16 season, several events occurred that changed the NHA and the Blueshirts specifically. Robinson joined the Canadian military in 1915 and put the Blueshirts up for sale.[tpl]sfn|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|pp=85-86[/tpl] Robinson received two offers for the club; the McNamara brothers and Eddie Livingstone, owner of the Toronto Shamrocks. Livingstone was from Toronto and offered more, and Robinson accepted his bid.[tpl]sfn|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=86[/tpl] At the same time, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association—upset over the NHA's efforts to bring Cyclone Taylor back east—broke all ties with the NHA and conducted a player raid. The PCHA created a new team in Seattle and stocked it with the Torontos' two leading scorers in Wilson and Foyston, their goaltender, Hap Holmes, and two other key members of the Toronto team in Jack Walker and Eddie Carpenter. The only regular Blue Shirt players to remain in Toronto were Cameron and Roy McGiffin.[tpl]sfn|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=88[/tpl] Livingstone announced he planned to sell the Shamrocks.[tpl]sfn|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=89[/tpl] After the dust settled, the Patricks had stocked their new team, conducted a raid on the NHA, Robinson was able to sell his team and Livingstone had the Toronto market to himself. Despite the raid, Livingstone did not retaliate against the PCHA and never did. According to authors Morey Holzman and Joseph Nieforth, this strongly suggested a deal had been made between Livingstone, Robinson and the Patricks.[tpl]sfn|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=91[/tpl] To make up for the players lost in the raid, Livingstone transferred Shamrocks players to the Blueshirts and allowed the Shamrock franchise to go dormant. The Torontos, composed mostly of former Shamrock players, skated to a record of 9 wins, 14 losses and 1 tie in the 1915–16 NHA season, finishing in last place in the five-team league.
Livingstone was frequently at odds with his fellow owners, particularly Sam Lichtenhein of the Montreal Wanderers. Tempers boiled over when the NHA added a second Toronto team in 1916–17, representing the 228th Battalion of the Canadian army. The 228th was forced to withdraw its team in mid-season when the unit was called overseas. That left the NHA with an odd number of teams, and the team owners—at a meeting that did not include Livingstone—decided to even-up the number of teams by suspending operations of the Torontos for the rest of the season. All players were given to other NHA teams for the rest of the season. At the time, the plan was to return the players to the Toronto franchise, but the rest of the league wanted Livingstone out. At the end of the season, Toronto was reinstated, with the condition that the club was to be sold within 60 days. However, Livingstone obtained a court order to prevent the sale.[tpl]cite news |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=March 19, 1917 |title=Suit Against N.H.A. Clubs |page=16[/tpl]

===1917–19: Arena era===

Before the start of the 1917–18 season, the NHA owners announced that the league would not operate in the 1917–18 season. About two weeks later, all of the owners except Livingstone announced that they were creating a new league, the National Hockey League.  Livingstone was not invited to participate in the new league.  However, the other teams wished to continue a team in Toronto, and also needed a fourth team to balance the schedule due to the Quebec Bulldogs' decision to sit out the season.  Accordingly, Livingstone's landlord, the Toronto Arena Company, was given a temporary Toronto franchise in the NHL and leased Livingstone's Torontos players for the inaugural 1917–18 NHL season.[tpl]sfn|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=157[/tpl] At the time, Frank Calder, the NHL president, was demanding that the Arena Company and Livingstone come to an agreement to transfer the franchise. 
To Toronto fans, it would have looked like little had changed.  Although the team had no official name, it was made up mostly of former Blue Shirts.  As a result, the newspapers still called the team the Blue Shirts or the Torontos, as they always had.[tpl]Cite book |title=The Toronto Blue Shirts a.k.a. The Torontos, the NHL's first Stanley Cup champions 1917-1918| last=Morrison |first=John |last2=Mclatchy |first2=Doug |publisher=Hockey Information Service Inc. |year=1996 |isbn=1-894014-00-6 |postscript=[/tpl] Led by general manager Charlie Querrie and coach Dick Carroll, the team won the Stanley Cup in 1918. In fitting fashion, no winner was engraved on the Stanley Cup. However, in 1947, the NHL added the name of the Toronto Arenas for 1918.
The Arena Company had originally promised to return the Toronto players to Livingstone if no transfer could be arranged. Instead, before the 1918–19 season, it formed a new club, the Toronto Arena Hockey Club.[tpl]sfn |Holzman |Nieforth |2002 |pp=197–198[/tpl] This new franchise was separated from the Arena Company because it was due money to Livingstone from the players and the Stanley Cup revenues (fixed later by court at $20,000).  Additionally, it could exist separately from any legal action filed by Livingstone. On paper, the new club was owned by Querrie and Hubert Vearncombe, Secretary-Treasurer of the Arena Co.[tpl]sfn |Holzman |Nieforth |2002 |p=198[/tpl] The NHL readily admitted this new team as a member in good standing. Querrie remained as general manager. However, the team had a dismal five-win season and was forced to suspend operations in February, and blamed Livingstone for interference.
By 1919, the NHA owners had established that there would be no revival of the NHA. However, the dispute with Livingstone forced the Arena Company into bankruptcy.  The Arenas were sold to a group headed by Querrie, who renamed them the Toronto St. Patricks.  This team became the Toronto Maple Leafs midway through the 1926–27 season. The NHA/NHL claimed the $5000 franchise fee from the 1919 St. Patricks was to 'buy' Livingstone's hockey club. The proceeds appear to have gone into Mr. Calder's pocket.[tpl]sfn |Holzman |Nieforth |2002 |p=212[/tpl]
Despite the ties to the Torontos, the Maple Leafs do not claim the Blue Shirts' history as their own (unlike the Canadiens or Senators, the other NHL franchises with NHA roots).  They do, however, claim the history of the "temporary" Toronto NHL franchise of 1917–18.
