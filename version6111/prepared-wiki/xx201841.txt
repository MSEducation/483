Cheap Monday is a Swedish clothing label. It was founded in 2000 by Örjan Andersson and Adam Friberg, originally as a second-hand clothing store, in a suburb of Stockholm. The clothes started selling on March 10, 2004, and from the beginning in only one store called Weekday. The name of the brand originates from the fact that the original store was only open on Sunday. http://www.cheapmonday.com The brand is known for their idiosyncratic designs, and has expanded from their original focus on jeans to include sneakers, flannel, and shirts. Current creative director is Ann-Sofie Back.
Cheap Monday clothes are distributed in a variety of stores worldwide, including Urban Outfitters and Barneys New York. Recently, Cheap Monday has also found strong popularity in Melbourne, Australia. They are recognized by their distinctive logo of a skull, which originally included an inverted crucifix. The designers of the logo, Björn Atldax and Karl Grandin of the design group Vår, meant it as an anti-Christian statement, citing the religion as the cause of many wars.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,180171,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Anti-Christian Jeans Are a Trend in Sweden | date=December 30, 2005[/tpl] By January 2010, the logo was altered with the inverted crucifix replaced by a single vertical line.
