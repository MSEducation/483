The series aired in many of the stations that would later become either UPN or WB affiliates. She-Wolf of London premiered along with two other shows, Shades of L.A. and They Came from Outer Space on October 9, 1990 in 1990-91, in 1994, the Action Pack initially ran a series of television movies, which led to the run of several television shows the following year.Mysteries Surrounding the Creation of the Syndicated Television Show XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS Whoosh Online Edition.
