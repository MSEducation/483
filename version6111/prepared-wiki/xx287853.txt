The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi will be televised by a number of broadcasters throughout the world. As with previous years, Olympic Broadcasting Services will produce the world feed provided to local broadcasters for use in their coverage. In most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 and 2016 Olympics were packaged together, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well, while in Australia, the 2014 Games were offered individually after all three major networks were unable to reach a deal for both.

In the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics will be the first in a US$4.38 billion contract with NBC Sports, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020 (with broadcast rights to Sochi valued at US$775 million alone). As it did during the 2012 Summer Olympics (which brought strong viewership, and ultimately turned a profit of $88 million, unlike the previous Winter Olympics, which resulted in a loss of US$223 million), NBC offered live and tape-delayed coverage of events on television across its free-to-air network and a number of pay TV channels, and provided streaming of all events online and on mobile platforms.[tpl]cite web|title=Lazarus: We Believe Sochi Olympics Will Be Profitable|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/491704-Lazarus_We_Believe_Sochi_Olympics_Will_Be_Profitable.php|work=Broadcasting & Cable|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl]
In Europe, sports marketing agency Sportfive replaced the European Broadcasting Union as the sales agency of broadcast rights to the 2014 and 2016 Olympics in 40 European countries.[tpl]cite news|title=IOC awards European broadcast rights to SPORTFIVE|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=oly&id=3915074|accessdate=13 August 2013|newspaper=ESPN|date=18 February 2009[/tpl] The IOC still separately negotiated broadcast rights in larger European countries such as the United Kingdom, where after uncertainty over whether rights to the Games could be picked up by a pay television broadcaster such as Sky Sports (but shared with a free-to-air broadcaster to comply with the laws forbidding certain major sporting events from being exclusively broadcast on pay channels), the BBC announced prior to the 2012 Summer Olympics that it would maintain exclusive rights to the Games through 2020.[tpl]cite news|last=Gibson|first=Owen|title=BBC's Olympic rights under threat from new TV deal|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/26/bbc-olympic-rights-new-tv-deal|accessdate=13 August 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=BBC strikes gold as network secures exclusive Olympics rights until 2020|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/olympics/article-2175304/London-2012-BBC-secures-exclusive-Olympics-broadcast-rights-2020.html|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=18 July 2012[/tpl]
In Australia, after all three major commercial networks (among the only entities which can hold the rights due to similar anti-siphoning laws) pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Games due to cost concerns (which included Nine Network, who had lost AUD$22 million on its joint coverage of the 2012 Games with Foxtel, and Seven Network, whose bid was rejected for being lower than what Nine/Foxtel paid), the IOC awarded broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics to Network Ten for AUD$20 million; a fraction of the amount paid by Nine and Foxtel for their own coverage.[tpl]cite news|title=Olympic fury over rules for TV sport|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/media/olympic-fury-over-rules-for-tv-sport/story-e6frg996-1226320796182|accessdate=13 August 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=7 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Seven withdraws from bidding for Olympics as price tag proves too great for TV networks|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/other-sports/seven-withdraws-from-bidding-for-olympics-as-price-tag-proves-too-great-for-tv-networks/story-e6frf56c-1226614918163#.UgooyX_4Xmt|accessdate=13 August 2013|newspaper=Fox Sports|date=8 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=MacKay|first=Duncan|title=Ten Network signs $20 million deal to broadcast Sochi 2014 in Australia, claim reports|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/winter-olympics/2014/1014188-ten-network-sign-20-million-deal-to-broadcast-sochi-2014-in-australia-claim-reports|accessdate=13 August 2013|newspaper=Inside the Games|date=12 May 2013[/tpl]
In Canada, where the 2010 and 2012 Games were broadcast by a consortium of Bell Media and Rogers Media properties, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation announced in August 2012 that it had acquired the Canadian broadcast rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games, returning the Olympics to CBC Television and Ici Radio-Canada Télé for the first time since 2008. While financial details were not announced, the CBC did state that it was a "financially and fiscally responsible bid", which would carry on the organization's 60 year history of Olympic broadcasting.[tpl]cite news|title=CBC wins rights to 2014, 2016 Olympic Games|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2012/08/01/cbc-olympics-rights.html|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=1 August 2012[/tpl] The CBC sub-licensed pay TV rights to TSN and Sportsnet (who served as the primary channels for pay TV coverage during the previous arrangement) in English, along with Réseau des sports and TVA Sports in French.[tpl]cite web|title=Sportsnet to air 200 hours of Sochi Games|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/2013/02/07/sportsnet_reaches_olympic_sub_license_deal/|publisher=Sportsnet|accessdate=8 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=CBC/Radio Canada welcomes partners in 2014 Sochi Olympics coverage|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/story/2013/02/07/sp-cbc-sports-sochi-olympics-tv-coverage.html|publisher=CBC|accessdate=8 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=CBC/Radio-Canada seals agreement with TVA Sports for the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1157471/cbc-radio-canada-seals-agreement-with-tva-sports-for-the-sochi-2014-olympic-winter-games|accessdate=3 May 2013|newspaper=Canada Newswire|date=2 May 2013[/tpl]
