[tpl]legend|#66B2FF|Signatories of Partnership for Peace with NATO[/tpl]]]
The United States is a founding member of NATO, the world's largest military alliance. The 28-nation alliance consists of Canada and much of Europe, including the nation with NATO's second largest military, the United Kingdom. Under the NATO charter, the United States is compelled to defend any NATO state that is attacked by a foreign power. NATO is restricted to within the North American and European areas. In 1989, the United States also granted five nations the major non-NATO ally status (MNNA); this number was increased in the late 1990s and following the September 11 attacks; it currently includes 15 nations. Each such state has a unique relationship with the United States, involving various military and economic partnerships and alliances.

==Geography==

===United Kingdom===

United States foreign policy affirms its alliance with the United Kingdom as its most important[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] bilateral relationship in the world, evidenced by aligned political affairs between the White House and 10 Downing Street, as well as joint military operations carried out between the two nations. While both the United States and the United Kingdom maintain close relationships with many other nations around the world, the level of cooperation in military planning, execution of military operations, nuclear weapons technology, and intelligence sharing with each other has been described as "unparalleled" among major powers throughout the 20th and early 21st century.[tpl]Cite journal |last=James |first=Wither |date=March 2006 |title=An Endangered Partnership: The Anglo-American Defence Relationship in the Early Twenty-first Century |journal=European Security |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=47–65 |doi=10.1080/09662830600776694 |accessdate=2007-01-09 |issn=0966-2839[/tpl]
The United States and Britain share the world's largest foreign direct investment partnership. American investment in the United Kingdom reached $255.4 billion in 2002, while British direct investment in the United States totaled $283.3 billion.US Department of State, Background Note on the United Kingdom

===Canada===

The bilateral relationship between Canada and the United States is of notable importance to both countries. About 75–85% of Canadian trade is with the United States, and Canada is the United States' largest trading partner and chief supplier of oil. While there are disputed issues between the two nations, relations are close and the two countries share the "world's longest undefended border."John Herd Thompson, and Stephen J. Randall, Canada and the United States: Ambivalent Allies (4th ed. McGill-Queen's University Press, 2008) is the standard scholarly survey The border was demilitarized after the War of 1812 and, apart from minor raids[tpl]clarify|date=November 2013[/tpl], has remained peaceful. Military collaboration began during World War II and continued throughout the Cold War on both a bilateral basis and a multilateral relationship through NATO. A high volume of trade and migration between the United States and Canada since the 1850s has generated closer ties, despite continued Canadian fears of being culturally overwhelmed by its neighbor, which is nine times larger in terms of population and eleven times larger in terms of economy.[tpl]cite news |title= 5.

===Mexico===

The United States shares a unique and often complex relationship with Mexico. A history of armed conflict goes back to the Texas Revolution in the 1830s, the Mexican–American War in the 1840s, and an American invasion in the 1910s. Important treaties include the Gadsden Purchase, and multilaterally with Canada, the North American Free Trade Agreement. The central issue in recent years has been illegal immigration, followed by illegal gun sales (from the U.S.), drug smuggling (to the U.S.) and escalating drug cartel violence just south of the U.S.-Mexico border.Tim Padgett, "Mexico's Calderón Needs to Listen, Not Just Lecture U.S." TIME May 19, 2010 onlineBurton Kirkwood, The History of Mexico (2010) pp 97–99, 138-52, 216

===Australia===

The United States' relationship with Australia is a very close one, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stating that "America doesn't have a better friend in the world than Australia".http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/25/2525854.htm The relationship is formalized by the ANZUS treaty and the Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement.
The two countries have a shared history, both have previously been British Colonies and many Americans flocked to the Australian goldfields in the 19th century. At a strategic level, the relationship really came to prominence in World War II, when the two nations worked extremely closely in the Pacific War against Japan, with General Douglas MacArthur undertaking his role as Supreme Allied Commander based in Australia, effectively having Australian troops and resources under his command. During this period, the cultural interaction between Australia and the U.S. were elevated to a higher level as over 1 million U.S. military personnel moved through Australia during the course of the war. The relationship continued to evolve throughout the second half of the 20th Century, and today now involves strong relationships at the executive and mid levels of government and the military, leading Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Kurt M. Campbell to declare that "in the last ten years, Australia has ascended to one of the closest one or two allies the U.S. on the planet".[tpl]cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/q-and-a-news/q-guyon-espiner-interviews-kurt-campbell-3065958 |title=Q+A: Guyon Espiner interviews Kurt Campbell |date=October 11, 2009 |work=Television New Zealand |accessdate=September 30, 2011[/tpl]

===Middle East===

The United States has many important allies in the Greater Middle East region. These allies are Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel, Egypt, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Morocco. Israel and Egypt are leading recipients of United States foreign aid, receiving $2.775 billionhttp://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/aid2010.html Congress Approves FY2010 Aid to Israel and 1.75 billion in 2010. Turkey is an ally of the United States through its membership in NATO, while all of the other countries except Saudi Arabia and Qatar are major non-NATO allies.
The United States invested several hundred billion dollars in the destruction of Iraq's infrastructure and military in 2003 invasion of Iraq.http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf The Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and other Global War on Terror Operations since 9/11 Turkey is host to approximately 90 B61 nuclear bombs at Incirlik Air Base.http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-206266-report-us-considers-withdrawing-nuclear-bombs-from-turkey.html Other allies include Qatar, where 3,500 U.S. troops are based,http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=130093&page=1 and Bahrain, where the United States Navy maintains NSA Bahrain, home of NAVCENT and the Fifth Fleet.

===Japan===

The relationship began in the 1850s as the U.S. was a major factor in forcing Japan to resume contacts with the outer world beyond a very restricted role. In the late 19th century the Japanese sent many delegations to Europe, and some to the U.S., to discover and copy the latest technology and thereby modernize Japan very rapidly and allow it to build its own empire. There was some friction over control of Hawaii and the Philippines, but Japan stood aside as the U.S. annexed those lands in 1898. Likewise the U.S. did not object when Japan took control of Korea. The two nations cooperated with the European powers in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900, but the U.S. was increasingly troubled about Japan's denial of the Open Door Policy that would ensure that all nations could do business with China on an equal basis.Foster Rhea Dulles, Yankees and Samurai: America's Role in the Emergence of Modern Japan, 1791–1900 (1965)
President Theodore Roosevelt admired Japan's strength as it defeated a major European power, Russia. He brokered an end to the war between Russia and Japan in 1905–6. Anti-Japanese sentiment (especially on the West Coast) soured relations in the 1907–24 era. In the 1930s the U.S. protested vehemently against Japan's seizure of Manchuria (1931), its war against China (1937–45), and its seizure of Indochina (Vietnam) 1940–41. American sympathies were with China and Japan rejected increasingly angry American demands that Japan pull out of China. The two nations fought an all-out war 1941–45; the U.S. won a total victory, with heavy bombing (including two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki) that devastated Japan's 50 largest industrial cities. The American army under Douglas MacArthur occupied and ruled Japan, 1945–51, with the successful goal of sponsoring a peaceful, prosperous and democratic nation.Walter LaFeber, The Clash: A History of US–Japan Relations (W.W. Norton, 1997)
In 1951, the U.S. and Japan signed Treaty of San Francisco and Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan, subsequently revised as Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan in 1960, relations since then have been excellent. The United States considers Japan to be one of its closest allies, and it is both a Major Non-NATO ally and NATO contact country. The United States has several military bases in Japan including Yokosuka, which harbors the U.S. 7th Fleet. The JSDF, or Japanese Self Defense Force, cross train with the U.S. Military, often providing auxiliary security and conducting war games. When the U.S.President Barack Obama met with Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso in 2009, he said the relationship with Japan as the "cornerstone of security in East Asia".[tpl]cite news|title=Japanese Prime Minister Meets With Obama, Says Economy Complicates North Korea Talks|work=Washington Post|date=2009-02-25|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/24/AR2009022403404.html|accessdate=2013-01-24[/tpl] After the several years of critical moment during Japan's Democratic Party administration, President Obama and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reconfirmed the importance of its alliance and currently the U.S. and Japan negotiating to participate Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership.[tpl]cite news|title=Japan and United States Reaffirm Their Close Ties|work=New York Times|date=2013-02-22|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/world/asia/japan-and-united-states-reaffirm-their-close-ties.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|accessdate=2013-02-23[/tpl]Joint Statement by the United States and Japan

===South Korea===

South Korea–United States relations have been most extensive since 1945, when the United States helped establish capitalism in South Korea and led the UN-sponsored Korean War against North Korea and China (1950–1953).Jae Ho  Chung, Between Ally and Partner: Korea-China Relations and the United States (2008) excerpt and text search Stimulated by heavy American aid[tpl]by whom|date=February 2013[/tpl], South Korea's rapid economic growth, democratization and modernization greatly reduced its U.S. dependency. Large numbers of U.S. forces remain in Korea. At the 2009 G-20 London summit, U.S. President Barack Obama called South Korea "one of America's closest allies and greatest friends." http://seoul.usembassy.gov/rok_040209.html

===China===

American relations with the People's Republic of China are complex. A great amount of trade between the two countries necessitates positive political relations, although occasional disagreements over tariffs, currency exchange rates and the Political status of Taiwan do occur. The U.S. criticizes China on human rights issues.

===Taiwan===

Taiwan (officially the Republic of China), does not have official diplomatic relations with America and no longer receives diplomatic recognition from the State Department of the United States, but it conducts unofficial diplomatic relations through its de facto embassy, commonly known as the "American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)", and is considered to be a strong Asian ally and supporter of the United States.Nancy Bernkopf Tucker, ed., Dangerous Strait: The U.S.-Taiwan-China Crisis (2005)

===ASEAN===

Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is an important partner for United States in both economic and geostrategic aspects. ASEAN's geostrategic importance stems from many factors, including: the strategic location of member countries, the large shares of global trade that pass through regional waters, and the alliances and partnerships which the United States shares with ASEAN member states. In July 2009, the United States signed ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, which establishes guiding principles intended to build confidence among its signatories with the aim of maintaining regional peace and stability.ASEAN Matters for America ASEAN's Importance Trade flows are robust and increasing between America and the ASEAN region. Since 2002 exports to the United States have gained 40% in value while U.S. exports to ASEAN increased 62%.ASEAN Matters for America US-ASEAN Relationship

====Indonesia====

As the largest ASEAN member, Indonesia has played an active and prominent role in developing the organization.Jakarta Post Editorial: The ASEAN cage For United States, Indonesia is important for dealing with certain issues; such as terrorism,U.S.-Indonesia Military Relations in The Anti-Terror War democracy, and how United States project its relations with Islamic world, since Indonesia has the world's largest Islamic population, and one that honors and respects religious diversity.Indonesia: An Important Focus Point for World Security US eyes Indonesia as potential strategic allies in Southeast Asia.US Eyes Indonesia, Vietnam as Potential Strategic Allies in Southeast Asia During his stately visit to Indonesia, U.S. President Barack Obama has held up Indonesia as an example of how a developing nation can embrace democracy and diversity.Obama hails Indonesia as example for worldObama delivers a speech in the University of Indonesia

====Malaysia====

Despite poor relations under the Mahathir Mohamad government, ties have been thawed under Najib Razak's administration. Economic ties are particularly robust, with the United States being Malaysia's largest trading partner and Malaysia is the tenth-largest trading partner of the U.S. Annual two-way trade amounts to $49 billion. The United States and Malaysia launched negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) in June 2006.
The United States and Malaysia enjoy strong security cooperation. Malaysia hosts the Southeast Asia Regional Center for Counterterrorism (SEARCCT), where over 2000 officials from various countries have received training. The United States is among the foreign countries that has collaborated with the center in conducting capacity building programmes. The U.S. and Malaysia share a strong military-to-military relationship with numerous exchanges, training, joint exercises, and visits.

====Myanmar====

Bilateral ties have generally been strained but are slowly improving. The United States has placed broad sanctions on Burma because of the military crackdown in 1988 and the military regime's refusal to honour the election results of the 1990 People's Assembly election. Similarly, the European Union has placed embargoes on Burma, including an arms embargo, cessation of trade preferences, and suspension of all aid with the exception of humanitarian aid.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/external_relations/myanmar/intro/index.htm |title= The EU's relations with Burma / Myanmar |accessdate=2006-07-13 |publisher=European Union|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060725000750/http%3A//ec.europa.eu/comm/external_relations/myanmar/intro/index.htm |archivedate = 25 July 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
US and European government sanctions against the military government, alongside boycotts and other types direct pressure on corporations by western supporters of the Burmese democracy movement, have resulted in the withdrawal from Burma of most U.S. and many European companies. However, several Western companies remain due to loopholes in the sanctions.The List: Burma's Economic Lifelines. Foreign Policy. October 2007 Asian corporations have generally remained willing to continue investing in Myanmar and to initiate new investments, particularly in natural resource extraction.
Ongoing reforms have improved relations between Burma and the United States.

====Philippines====

The United States ruled the Philippines from 1898 to 1946. The Spanish government ceded the Philippines to the United States in the 1898 Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish-American War. The United States finally recognized Philippine independence on July 4, 1946 in the Treaty of Manila. July 4 was observed in the Philippines as Independence Day until August 4, 1964 when, upon the advice of historians and the urging of nationalists, President Diosdado Macapagal signed into law Republic Act No. 4166 designating June 12 as the country's Independence Day.  Since 2003 the U.S. has designated the Philippines as a Major Non-NATO Ally.
According to Brewer,[tpl]cite book|last=Brewer|first=Susan|title=Why America Fights: Patriotism and War Propaganda from the Philippines to Iraq|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-538135-1[/tpl] the United States has consistently used propaganda to give a false impression of a war for democracy, while fighting wars in far off countries.

====Thailand====

Thailand and the US are both former Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) members, being close partners throughout the Cold War, and are still close allies. Since 2003, the U.S. has designated the Thailand as a Major Non-NATO Ally.

====Vietnam====

United States involved in Vietnam War in 1955 to 1975. In 1995, President Bill Clinton announced the formal normalization of diplomatic relations with Vietnam.  Today US eyes Vietnam as a potential strategic ally in Southeast Asia.

===Eastern Europe===

American relations with Eastern Europe are influenced by the legacy of the Cold War. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, former Communist-bloc states in Europe have gradually transitioned to democracy and capitalism. Many have also joined the European Union and NATO, strengthening economic ties with the broader Western world and gaining the military protection of the United States via the North Atlantic Treaty.

===Kosovo===

The UN Security Council remains divided on the question of Kosovo's declaration of independence. Kosovo declared its independence on February 17, 2008, whilst Serbia maintains that Kosovo is part of its territory. Of the five members with veto power in the UN Security Council, the USA, UK, and France recognized the declaration of independence, and China has expressed concern, while Russia considers it illegal. "In its declaration of independence, Kosovo committed itself to the highest standards of democracy, including freedom and tolerance and justice for citizens of all ethnic backgrounds", former President George W Bush of the US Republican party said on February 19, 2008.Bush Hails Kosovo Independence, U.S. Department of State's Bureau of International Information ProgramsBush insists Kosovo must be independent and receives hero's welcome in Albania, The Guardian

===Hub and spoke vs multilateral===

While America's relationships with Europe have tended to be in terms of multilateral frameworks, such as NATO, America's relations with Asia have tended to be based on a series of bilateral relationships where the client states would coordinate with the United States in order to not have to deal directly with each other.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] On May 30, 2009, at the Shangri-La Dialogue Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged the nations of Asia to build on this hub and spoke model as they established and grew multilateral institutions such as ASEAN, APEC and the ad hoc arrangements in the area.Gates Delivers Keynote Address to Open Asia Security Conference However in 2011 Gates said that the United States must serve as the "indispensable nation," for building multilateral cooperation.Shanker, Tom. "Gates Talks of Boosting Asian Security Despite Budget Cuts." New York Times, 1 June 2011.

==Oil==

===Persian Gulf===

The U.S. currently produces about 40% of the oil that it consumes; its imports have exceeded domestic production since the early 1990s. Since the U.S.'s oil consumption continues to rise, and its oil production continues to fall, this ratio may continue to decline.Crude Oil and Total Petroleum Imports Top 15 Countries Former U.S. President George W. Bush identified dependence on imported oil as an urgent "national security concern".Bush Leverage With Russia, Iran, China Falls as Oil Prices Rise, Bloomberg.com
Two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves are estimated to be found in the
Persian Gulf.Shrinking Our Presence in Saudi Arabia, New York TimesThe End of Cheap Oil, National Geographic Despite its distance, the Persian Gulf region was first proclaimed to be of national interest to the United States during World War II. Petroleum is of central importance to modern armies, and the United States—as the world's leading oil producer at that time—supplied most of the oil for the Allied armies. Many U.S. strategists were concerned that the war would dangerously reduce the U.S. oil supply, and so they sought to establish good relations with Saudi Arabia, a kingdom with large oil reserves.Crude Designs: The Rip-Off of Iraq's Oil Wealth
The Persian Gulf region continued to be regarded as an area of vital importance to the United States during the Cold War. Three Cold War United States Presidential doctrines—the Truman Doctrine, the Eisenhower Doctrine, and the Nixon Doctrine—played roles in the formulation of the Carter Doctrine, which stated that the United States would use military force if necessary to defend its "national interests" in the Persian Gulf region.The war is about oil but it's not that simple, msnbc.com Carter's successor, President Ronald Reagan, extended the policy in October 1981 with what is sometimes called the "Reagan Corollary to the Carter Doctrine", which proclaimed that the United States would intervene to protect Saudi Arabia, whose security was threatened after the outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War.The United States Navy and the Persian Gulf Some analysts have argued that the implementation of the Carter Doctrine and the Reagan Corollary also played a role in the outbreak of the 2003 Iraq War.What if the Chinese were to apply the Carter Doctrine?, Haaretz - Israel NewsSelling the Carter Doctrine, TIMEAlan Greenspan claims Iraq war was really for oil, Times OnlineOil giants to sign contracts with Iraq, The Guardian

===Canada===

Almost all of Canada's energy exports go to the United States, making it the largest foreign source of U.S. energy imports: Canada is consistently among the top sources for U.S. oil imports, and it is the largest source of U.S. natural gas and electricity imports.See Energy Information Administration, "Canada" (2009 report)

===Africa===

In 2007 the U.S. was Sub-Saharan Africa's largest single export market accounting for 28.4% of exports (second in total to the EU at 31.4%). 81% of U.S. imports from this region were petroleum products.http://www.agoa.gov/resources/US_African_Trade_Profile_2009.pdf

==Foreign aid==

Foreign assistance is a core component of the State Department's international affairs budget, which is $49 billion in all for 2014.See "FY 2014 Omnibus – State and Foreign Operations Appropriations" (Jan 2014   Aid is considered an essential instrument of U.S. foreign policy. There are four major categories of non-military foreign assistance: bilateral development aid, economic assistance supporting U.S. political and security goals, humanitarian aid, and multilateral economic contributions (for example, contributions to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund).Foreign Aid: An Introductory Overview of U.S. Programs and Policy
In absolute dollar terms, the United States government is the largest international aid donor ($23 billion in 2014).  The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) manages the bulk of bilateral economic assistance; the Treasury Department handles most multilateral aid.  In addition many private agencies, churches and philanthropies provide aid.
Although the United States is the largest donor in absolute dollar terms, it is actually ranked 19 out of 27 countries on the Commitment to Development Index. The CDI ranks the 27 richest donor countries on their policies that affect the developing world. In the aid component the United States is penalized for low net aid volume as a share of the economy, a large share of tied or partially tied aid, and a large share of aid given to less poor and relatively undemocratic governments.

==Military==

The United States has fought wars and intervened militarily on many occasions. See, Timeline of United States military operations. The U.S. also operates a vast network of military bases around the world. See, List of United States military bases.
In recent years, the U.S. has used its military superiority as sole superpower to lead a number of wars, including, most recently, the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 as part of its global "War on Terror."

===Aid===

The U.S. provides military aid through many different channels. Counting the items that appear in the budget as 'Foreign Military Financing' and 'Plan Colombia', the U.S. spent approximately $4.5 billion in military aid in 2001, of which $2 billion went to Israel, $1.3 billion went to Egypt, and $1 billion went to Colombia.http://www.amnestyusa.org/all-countries/colombia/us-military-aid-to-colombia/page.do?id=1101863 Since 9/11, Pakistan has received approximately $11.5 billion in direct military aid.http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=226110

===Exporting democracy===

In United States history, critics have charged that presidents have used democracy to justify military intervention abroad.[ref]
 Also see this page.[/ref] Critics have also charged that the U.S. overthrew democratically elected governments in Iran, Guatemala, and in other instances. Studies have been devoted to the historical success rate of the U.S. in exporting democracy abroad. Some studies of American intervention have been pessimistic about the overall effectiveness of U.S. efforts to encourage democracy in foreign nations.[ref]
PDF file.[/ref] Until recently, scholars have generally agreed with international relations professor Abraham Lowenthal that U.S. attempts to export democracy have been "negligible, often counterproductive, and only occasionally positive." Other studies find U.S. intervention has had mixed results, and another by Hermann and Kegley has found that military interventions have improved democracy in other countries.[tpl]cite journal |first=Margaret G. |last=Hermann |year=1998 |title=The U.S. Use of Military Intervention to Promote Democracy: Evaluating the Record |journal=International Interactions  |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=91–114 |doi=10.1080/03050629808434922 |last2=Kegley |first2=Charles[/tpl]

====Opinion that U.S. intervention does not export democracy====

Professor Paul W. Drake argued that the U.S. first attempted to export democracy in Latin America through intervention from 1912 to 1932. Drake argued that this was contradictory because international law defines intervention as "dictatorial interference in the affairs of another state for the purpose of altering the condition of things." The study suggested that efforts to promote democracy failed because democracy needs to develop out of internal conditions, and can not be forcibly imposed. There was disagreement about what constituted democracy; Drake suggested American leaders sometimes defined democracy in a narrow sense of a nation having elections; Drake suggested a broader understanding was needed. Further, there was disagreement about what constituted a "rebellion"; Drake saw a pattern in which the U.S. State Department disapproved of any type of rebellion, even so-called "revolutions", and in some instances rebellions against dictatorships.[tpl]cite book |last=Lowenthal |first=Abraham F. |date=March 1, 1991 |title=Exporting Democracy : The United States and Latin America |pages=1, 4, 5|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-4132-1[/tpl] Historian Walter LaFeber stated, "The world's leading revolutionary nation (the U.S.) in the eighteenth century became the leading protector of the status quo in the twentieth century."[tpl]cite book |last=Lafeber |first=Walter |year=1993 |title=Inevitable Revolutions: The United States in Central America |publisher=W.

Mesquita and Downs evaluated 35 U.S. interventions from 1945 to 2004 and concluded that in only one case, Colombia, did a "full fledged, stable democracy" develop within ten years following the intervention.[ref]Factors included limits on executive power, clear rules for the transition of power, universal adult suffrage, and
competitive elections.[/ref] Samia Amin Pei argued that nation building in developed countries usually unravelled four to six years after American intervention ended. Pei, based on study of a database on worldwide democracies called Polity, agreed with Mesquita and Downs that U.S. intervention efforts usually don't produce real democracies, and that most cases result in greater authoritarianism after ten years.
Professor Joshua Muravchik argued U.S. occupation was critical for Axis power democratization after World War II, but America's failure to encourage democracy in the third world "prove ... that U.S. military occupation is not a sufficient condition to make a country democratic."Peceny, p. 186. The success of democracy in former Axis countries such as Italy were seen as a result of high national per-capita income, although U.S. protection was seen as a key to stabilization and important for encouraging the transition to democracy. Steven Krasner agreed that there was a link between wealth and democracy; when per-capita incomes of $6,000 were achieved in a democracy, there was little chance of that country ever reverting to an autocracy, according to an analysis of his research in the Los Angeles Times.

====Opinion that U.S. intervention has mixed results====

Tures examined 228 cases of American intervention from 1973 to 2005, using Freedom House data. A plurality of interventions, 96, caused no change in the country's democracy. In 69 instances the country became less democratic after the intervention. In the remaining 63 cases, a country became more democratic. However this does not take into account the direction the country would have gone with no US intervention.

====Opinion that U.S. intervention effectively exports democracy====

Hermann and Kegley found that American military interventions designed to protect or promote democracy increased freedom in those countries. Peceny argued that the democracies created after military intervention are still closer to an autocracy than a democracy, quoting Przeworski "while some democracies are more democratic than others, unless offices are contested, no regime should be considered democratic."[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=June 2008[/tpl][/ref] Therefore, Peceny concludes, it is difficult to know from the Hermann and Kegley study whether U.S. intervention has only produced less repressive autocratic governments or genuine democracies.Peceny, p. 193
Peceny stated that the United States attempted to export democracy in 33 of its 93 20th-century military interventions.Peceny, p. 2 Peceny argued that proliberal policies after military intervention had a positive impact on democracy.[ref]Review:

==Covert actions==

United States foreign policy also includes covert actions to topple foreign governments that have been opposed to the United States. In 1953 the CIA, working with the British government, endorsed the military in a coup d'état against the anti-British government of Iran led by Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh who had attempted to nationalize Iran's oil, threatening the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.[tpl]Cite news|work=The New York Times|title=Special Report: Secret History of the CIA in Iran|url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/041600iran-cia-index.html| year=2000[/tpl] See Operation Ajax.
During the massacre of alleged communists in 1960s Indonesia, the U.S. government provided assistance to the Indonesian military that, according to Bradley Simpson, Director of the Indonesia/East Timor Documentation Project at the National Security Archive, helped facilitate the mass killings.Historian Claims West Backed Post-Coup Mass Killings in '65.

==Human Rights==

The inclusion of Human Rights in U.S. foreign policy had a controversial start. For one thing, human rights driven foreign policy did not originate in the Executive branch but was instead enforced upon it by Congress, starting in the 1970s.[tpl]cite book|last=Crabb|first=Cecil V.|title=Invitation to Struggle: Congress, the President and Foreign Policy|year=1992|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|location=Michigan|isbn=978-0-87187-622-5|pages=187–211|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vW2GAAAAMAAJ&q=Invitation+to+Struggle&dq=Invitation+to+Struggle&source=bl&ots=Zef6IJ2aj5&sig=opXiwGJ0mjjNwwLGpGV-aBVi0Es&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OV4JUMLPAcyJ6wHD_fyJCg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA|edition=2nd|coauthors=Pat Holt[/tpl] Following the Vietnam War, the feeling that U.S. foreign policy had grown apart from traditional American values was seized upon by Senator Donald M. Fraser (D, MI), leading the Subcommittee on International Organizations and Movements, in criticizing Republican Foreign Policy under the Nixon administration. In the early 1970s, Congress concluded the Vietnam War and passed the War Powers Act. As "part of a growing assertiveness by Congress about many aspects of Foreign Policy,"[tpl]cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David|title=Human Rights and U.S. Foreign Policy: Congress Reconsidered|year=1988|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville|isbn=978-0-8130-0885-1|pages=1–23|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cppHP3zb-ccC&dq=Human+Rights+and+U.S.+Foreign+Policy:+Congress+Reconsidered&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl] Human Rights concerns became a battleground between the Legislative and the Executive branches in the formulation of foreign policy. David Forsythe points to three specific, early examples of Congress interjecting its own thoughts on foreign policy:
These measures were repeatedly used by Congress, with varying success, to affect U.S. foreign policy towards the inclusion of Human Rights concerns. Specific examples include El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and South Africa. The Executive (from Nixon to Reagan) argued that the Cold War required placing regional security in favor of US interests over any behavioral concerns of national allies. Congress argued the opposite, in favor of distancing the United States from oppressive regimes. Nevertheless, according to historian Daniel Goldhagen, during the last two decades of the Cold War, the number of American client states practicing mass murder outnumbered those of the Soviet Union.[ref]Daniel Goldhagen (2009).

==War on Drugs==

United States foreign policy is influenced by the efforts of the U.S. government to control imports of illicit drugs, including cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and cannabis. This is especially true in Latin America, a focus for the U.S. War on Drugs. Those efforts date back to at least 1880, when the U.S. and China completed an agreement that prohibited the shipment of opium between the two countries.
Over a century later, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act requires the President to identify the major drug transit or major illicit drug-producing countries. In September 2005,Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2006 the following countries were identified: Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela. Two of these, Burma and Venezuela are countries that the U.S. considers to have failed to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months. Notably absent from the 2005 list were Afghanistan, the People's Republic of China and Vietnam; Canada was also omitted in spite of evidence that criminal groups there are increasingly involved in the production of MDMA destined for the United States and that large-scale cross-border trafficking of Canadian-grown cannabis continues. The U.S. believes that the Netherlands are successfully countering the production and flow of MDMA to the U.S.

==Criticism==

Critics from the left cite episodes that undercut leftist governments or showed support for Israel. Others cite human rights abuses and violations of international law. Critics have charged that the U.S. presidents have used democracy to justify military intervention abroad. It was also noted that the U.S. overthrew democratically elected governments in Iran, Guatemala, and in other instances. Studies have been devoted to the historical success rate of the U.S. in exporting democracy abroad. Some studies of American intervention have been pessimistic about the overall effectiveness of U.S. efforts to encourage democracy in foreign nations. Until recently, scholars have generally agreed with international relations professor Abraham Lowenthal that U.S. attempts to export democracy have been "negligible, often counterproductive, and only occasionally positive." Other studies find U.S. intervention has had mixed results, and another by Hermann and Kegley has found that military interventions have improved democracy in other countries.

==Support==

Regarding support for certain anti-Communist dictatorships during the Cold War, a response is that they were seen as a necessary evil, with the alternatives even worse Communist or fundamentalist dictatorships. David Schmitz says this policy did not serve U.S. interests. Friendly tyrants resisted necessary reforms and destroyed the political center (though not in South Korea), while the 'realist' policy of coddling dictators brought a backlash among foreign populations with long memories.The United States and Right-Wing Dictatorships, 1965–1989. David F. Schmitz. 2006.Do the sums, then compare U.S. and Communist crimes from the Cold War Telegraph, 11 December 2005, Niall Ferguson
Many democracies have voluntary military ties with United States. See NATO, ANZUS, Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, Mutual Defense Treaty with South Korea, and Major non-NATO ally. Those nations with military alliances with the U.S. can spend less on the military since they can count on U.S. protection. This may give a false impression that the U.S. is less peaceful than those nations.Give peace a rating May 31, 2007, from The Economist print editionJapan ranked as world's 5th most peaceful nation: report Japan Today, May 31, 2007
Research on the democratic peace theory has generally found that democracies, including the United States, have not made war on one another. There have been U.S. support for coups against some democracies, but for example Spencer R. Weart argues that part of the explanation was the perception, correct or not, that these states were turning into Communist dictatorships. Also important was the role of rarely transparent United States government agencies, who sometimes mislead or did not fully implement the decisions of elected civilian leaders.[tpl]cite book|last=Weart|first=Spencer R.|title=Never at War|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-300-07017-9[/tpl] pp. 221–224, 314.
Empirical studies (see democide) have found that democracies, including the United States, have killed much fewer civilians than dictatorships.DEATH BY GOVERNMENT By R.J. Rummel New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 1994. Online links: http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE1.HTM http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.FIG23.4.GIF http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.FIG2.GIFNo Lessons Learned from the Holocaust?, Barbara Harff, 2003. Media may be biased against the U.S. regarding reporting human rights violations. Studies have found that The New York Times coverage of worldwide human rights violations predominantly focuses on the human rights violations in nations where there is clear U.S. involvement, while having relatively little coverage of the human rights violations in other nations.[tpl]cite journal|author=Caliendo, S.M.|year=1999|title=All the News That's Fit to Print? New York Times Coverage of Human-Rights Violations|journal=The Harvard International Journal of Press Politics|volume=4|pages=48–69|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/harvard_international_journal_of_press_politics/v004/4.4caliendo.html|accessdate=2008-04-02[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Caliendo, Stephen. and Gibney, Mark.|year=2006|title=American Print Media Coverage of Human Rights Violations|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p152798_index.html?type=info|accessdate=2008-04-02[/tpl] For example, the bloodiest war in recent time, involving eight nations and killing millions of civilians, was the Second Congo War, which was almost completely ignored by the media.
Niall Ferguson argues that the U.S. is incorrectly blamed for all the human rights violations in nations they have supported. He writes that it is generally agreed that Guatemala was the worst of the US-backed regimes during the Cold War. However, the U.S. cannot credibly be blamed for all the 200,000 deaths during the long Guatemalan Civil War. The U.S. Intelligence Oversight Board writes that military aid was cut for long periods because of such violations, that the U.S. helped stop a coup in 1993, and that efforts were made to improve the conduct of the security services.Report on the Guatemala Review Intelligence Oversight Board. June 28, 1996.
Today the U.S. states that democratic nations best support U.S. national interests. According to the U.S. State Department, "Democracy is the one national interest that helps to secure all the others. Democratically governed nations are more likely to secure the peace, deter aggression, expand open markets, promote economic development, protect American citizens, combat international terrorism and crime, uphold human and worker rights, avoid humanitarian crises and refugee flows, improve the global environment, and protect human health."Democracy According to former U.S. President Bill Clinton, "Ultimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack each other."[tpl]cite news|author=Clinton, Bill|title=1994 State Of The Union Address|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/states/docs/sou94.htm|accessdate=2006-01-22|work=The Washington Post|date=January 28, 2000[/tpl] In one view mentioned by the U.S. State Department, democracy is also good for business. Countries that embrace political reforms are also more likely to pursue economic reforms that improve the productivity of businesses. Accordingly, since the mid-1980s, under President Ronald Reagan, there has been an increase in levels of foreign direct investment going to emerging market democracies relative to countries that have not undertaken political reforms.http://usinfo.state.gov/usinfo/USINFO/Products/Webchats/bohn_27_mar_2007.html Leaked cables in 2010 suggested that the "dark shadow of terrorism still dominates the United States' relations with the world".[tpl]cite news|first1=Scott|last1=Shane|first2=Andrew W.|last2=Lehren|title=Leaked Cables Offer Raw Look at U.S. Diplomacy|work=The New York Times|quote=The cables show that nearly a decade after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the dark shadow of terrorism still dominates the United States' relations with the world. ... |date=2010-11-28|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/29cables.html?_r=2&pagewanted=2|accessdate=2010-12-26[/tpl]
