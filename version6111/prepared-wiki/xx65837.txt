MacCentral was a web site that provided news and information covering the Apple Macintosh, originally as an independent entity and later as the news service for Mac Publishing Web sites, including Macworld.com and Playlist, before being subsumed by Macworld's own brand.
MacCentral was founded by Canadian businessman Stan Flack and James Dalrymple as Associate Editor in 1994.Dalrymple, Jim. "Stan Flack, MacCentral and MacMinute founder, passes away" 2008-4-14. Retrieved on April 16, 2008 In 1998, MacCentral Online acquired MacGaming.  MacCentral Online was purchased by Mac Publishing in 1999. In March 2001, Macworld folded the trade-focused MacWEEK into MacCentralEngst, Adam C. "MacWEEK to Roll into MacCentral", "TidBITS", 2001-5-9. Retrieved April 19, 2008. MacCentral was folded into the Macworld brand over a period of several years.
In June 2008 it was announced on the MacMinute news site that MacTech's Community News Scan and Macsimum News will act as caretakers to the archives of MacMinute News and Forums which is where most of Stan's faithful went upon the demise of MacCentral forums. They also announced they would continue to host the MacMinute Forum. Stan's Lounge is crowded with MacCentral and MacMinute faithful in honor of Stan Flack and all that he did for the Macintosh community.
On December 10, 2008 James Dalrymple announced that the name MacCentral lives on. With permission from MacWorld the old MacCentral Forums are now open at www.maccentralforums.com. Eight years of MacCentral forum history can now be researched. (Update: this is no longer the case. The database of the MacCentral forums no longer exists except in abbreviated format at archive.gov).

==MacCentral Forum==

Despite the rebranding of MacCentral, a cadre of loyal readers continued to maintain a presence in the MacCentral Forum, a community that remained in operation without being prominently linked to from anywhere on Macworld's primary site. Those forums were shut down in 2008, with many of the forum members relocating to the MacMinute Caf√© forum. And then, with the shutting down of the MacMinute forums in May 2008 the majority of forum members moved to MacCentral Cafe or other places on the internet.
