===Clasp===

The "Afghanistan" Clasp is awarded for service specifically in Afghanistan. Rosette on ribbon denotes clasp when no medal is worn.
There are two types of 'Afghanistan' clasps to date, the first initial issue from 2002–2004 the clasp had a smooth background behind the writing and from Op Herrick onwards (2005 to present) the clasp has a 'dappled' effect behind the writing, just like the 'Northern Ireland' clasp on the 1962–2007 General Service Medal. A third type of background can be found on 1000 medals awarded during 2009. These were manufactured by Gladman & Norman Ltd under a one-off contract to help with increased medal demand. The medal is issued without the clasp for service outside Afghanistan in support of ongoing operations, i.e. Pakistan and Oman.
The medal is also awarded to UK civilians employed on Ministry of Defence contracts in support of the British Forces in Afghanistan.Qualifying criteria is the same as HM Forces.The recipients name and title (Mr,Mrs etc) are engraved on the edge of the medal,whereas the military recipients have their rank,name and service number.

The ribbon consists of a broad central red stripe, flanked each side by a stripe of navy blue and one of light blue, to represent the three services, with an outer stripe of light brown, to represent the Afghan landscape.
