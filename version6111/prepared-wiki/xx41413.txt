Giselle Blondet (born January 9, 1964) is a Puerto Rican actress and TV host. She also founded the non-profit organization "Fundación Arte por La Paz".

==Early history==

Blondet was born Alba Giselle Blondet, to Victor Manuel Blondet and Alba Gomez, in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
In 1982 she married her first husband, jeweler Luis Iglesias, with whom she had a daughter. They divorced two years later in 1984.
In 1986 she married again, this second time with actor Luis Abreu. Marriage didn't last long and they divorced shortly after. Blondet spent the rest of the late 1980s participating in different television shows, soap operas, and mini-series, as well as in some theatre plays.
In 1989, she married for a third time, now with Argentine producer Harold Trucco, and they had daughter, Gabriela, and a son, Harold Emmanuel. The relationship encountered problems and ended in 1997. In June 1997, her career took off internationally as she became co-host Univision's international show ¡Despierta América! alongside Rafael José, Fernando Arau, Ana Maria Canseco, and Neida Sandoval. Since divorcing Trucco, she has remained single and says she wants to dedicate her free time to her children.

==Later career==

In 2004, Blondet published her autobiography Con los Pies en la Tierra. The following year, she left Despierta América to host a new television show about real-life tragedies, entitled Historias para Contar, but it was cancelled before it was broadcast. In 2006, she starred in a Spanish-language Christmas movie alongside José Feliciano and Raúl De Molina entitled Feliz Navidad. Blondet's movie was due to be released later that year but failed to be shown in theaters. Blondet's career may have had setbacks since she left Despierta America but in 2007 she found a great opportunity to become the host of a reality show in Univision, called Nuestra Belleza Latina (Our Latin Beauty). The show has hints of American Idol, America's Next Top Model, and Miss Universe, and was an early hit.
In 2010, after 14 years away from acting, she starred in an episode of Mujeres Asesinas as Luz Maria, alongside Cynthia Klitbo in the episode "Luz, Arrolladora".
In February 2012, she was one of a group of celebrities that walked down a catwalk in red dresses for the 'Heart Truth Red Dress Collection' show, part of New York Fashion Week. She wore an Oscar de la Renta dress.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shape.com/celebrities/celebrity-photos/stars-hit-runway-heart-health/slide/3|title=Rebecca Romijn - NY Fashion Week 2012 Kicks Off with the Red Dress Fashion Show|last=Nuñez|first=Alanna|date=10 February 2012|work=Shape Magazine|accessdate=1 February 2014[/tpl]
