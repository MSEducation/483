[[Ontological security]]

CATEGORIES: Ontology, Sociological terminology

Ontological security is a stable mental state derived from a sense of continuity in regard to the events in one's life. Giddens (1991) refers to ontological security as a sense of order and continuity in regard to an individual’s experiences. He argues that this is reliant on people’s ability to give meaning to their lives. Meaning is found in experiencing positive and stable emotions, and by avoiding chaos and anxiety (ibid; Elias, 1985). If an event occurs that is not consistent with the meaning of an individual's life, this will threaten that individual's ontological security. Ontological security also involves having a positive view of self, the world and the future.

==Ontological Security Threatened by Death==

Philip A. Mellor talks about this concept in regard to thanatology, arguing that when death strikes, it causes people to “question the meaningfulness and reality of the social frameworks in which they participate, shattering their ontological security” (1993, p13).

==Ontological Security Associated With Home Ownership==

"It has been said that people need the confidence, continuity and trust in the world which comprise ontological security in order to lead happy and fulfilled lives, and furthermore that ontological security can be attained more through owner occupied than rented housing.".[tpl]cite journal|url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/2644 |title=Ontological security and psychosocial benefits from the home: qualitative evidence on issues of tenure |publisher=Taylor & Francis |date=2013-07-04 |journal = Housing, Theory and Society |issn=1403-6096 |volume=18 |issue=1-2 |first=R. |last=Hiscock |accessdate=2013-07-16[/tpl]

==Ontological Security of Children==

Children are more likely to have a positive ontological security when the child's parents own their own home.Edward Scanlon, Deborah Page-Adams.  Homeownership and Youth Well-Being: An Empirical Test of Asset-Based Welfare(archive), Inclusion in Asset Building: Research Policy Symposium , 2000, Center for Social Development.  page 2:  "Peter Saunders (1978; 1990) refers to this control of housing space as 'ontological security'. This increased sense of control might lead to child well-being through increased capacities to parent effectively  (Green & White, 1997)" Reportedly, home ownership also improves parenting and allows for a future transfer of assets, thus facilitating ontological security.

==Ontological Security in Adult Learners==

"Adult educators also must secure the learners’ ontological security against existential anxieties by associating learners’ network and groups based on trust".[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/en/bse/200200000031/0185.htm |title=The Essential Conditions for Reflective Learning Based on “Ontological Security” |publisher=National Taiwan Normal University |journal=Bulletin of Adult and Continuing Education |pages=185 - 206 |issue = 31 |date2002= |accessdate=2013-07-16[/tpl]
