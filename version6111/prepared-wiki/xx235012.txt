Vehicle Production started in 1928 with the National Series AB Touring. In 1952-53 the ‘socialist’ Indian Government forced General Motors India to shut shop, along with other foreign car companies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chevrolet.co.in/content_data/AP/IN/en/GBPIN/001/BRANDSITE/chevrolet-in-india.html |title=Chevrolet in India |publisher=Chevrolet.co.in |date= |accessdate=2011-04-18[/tpl] However in 2003 Chevrolet Sales India Private Limited was established and the Chevrolet brand was re-launched in India.
