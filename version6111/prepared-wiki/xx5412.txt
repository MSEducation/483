CATEGORIES: SI base units, Units of mass

The kilogram or kilogramme (SI unit symbol: kg; SI dimension symbol: M), is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI) and is defined as being equal to the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK).  The avoirdupois (or international) pound, used in both the Imperial system and U.S. customary units, is defined as exactly [tpl]val|fmt=commas|0.45359237|u=kg[/tpl], making one kilogram approximately equal to 2.2046 avoirdupois pounds.
The gram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic centimeter of water at 4 °C, making the kilogram equal to the mass of one liter of water. The prototype kilogram, manufactured in 1799 and from which the current kilogram is based, has a mass equal to the mass of 1.000025 liters of water.
The kilogram is the only SI base unit with an SI prefix ("kilo", symbol "k") as part of its name. It is also the only SI unit that is still directly defined by an artifact rather than a fundamental physical property that can be reproduced in different laboratories.   Four of the seven base units in the SI system are defined relative to the kilogram so its stability is important.
The International Prototype Kilogram was commissioned by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) under the authority of the Metre Convention (1875), and is in the custody of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) who hold it on behalf of the CGPM. After the International Prototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) agreed in principle that the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant, but deferred a final decision until its next meeting, scheduled for 2014.
The International Prototype Kilogram (IPK) is rarely used or handled. Copies of the IPK kept by national metrology laboratories around the world were compared with the IPK in 1889, 1948, and 1989 to provide traceability of measurements of mass anywhere in the world back to the IPK.

==Etymology and usage==

The word kilogramme or kilogram is derived from the French kilogramme, which itself comes from the Greek "χίλιοι" (chilioi), meaning "thousand" and "γράμμα" (gramma) meaning "a small weight". The word kilogramme was written into French law in 1795 and the French spelling was adopted in the United Kingdom when the word was used for the first time in English in 1797, with the spelling kilogram being adopted in the United States. In the United Kingdom both spellings are used, with "kilogram" having become by far the more common.The spelling kilogram is the modern spelling used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the UK’s National Measurement Office, National Research Council of Canada, and the National Measurement Institute, Australia. UK law regulating the units to be used when trading by weight or measure does not prevent the use of either spelling.
In the 19th century the French word kilo, a shortening of kilogramme, was imported into the English language where it has been used to mean both kilogram and kilometre. While kilo is acceptable in many generalist texts, for example The Economist, its use is typically considered inappropriate in certain applications including scientific, technical and legal writing, where authors should adhere strictly to SI nomenclature. When the United States Congress gave the metric system legal status in 1866, it permitted the use of the word kilo as an alternative to the word kilogram, but in 1990 revoked the status of the word kilo.
In 1948 the CGPM commissioned the CIPM to "to make recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement, suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the Metre Convention". This led to the launch of SI in 1960 and the subsequent publication of the "SI Brochure," which stated that "It is not permissible to use abbreviations for unit symbols or unit names ...".[tpl]SIBrochure8th|page = 130[/tpl]The French text (which is the authoritiative text) states "Il n’est pas autorisé d’utiliser des abréviations pour les symboles et noms d’unités ..."

==Nature of mass==

The kilogram is a unit of mass, a property which corresponds to the common perception of how “heavy” an object is. Mass is an inertial property; that is, it is related to the tendency of an object at rest to remain at rest, or if in motion to remain in motion at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a force. According to "Newton's laws of motion" and the equation [tpl]nowrap|F [tpl]=[/tpl] ma[/tpl], when acted upon by a force F of one Newton, an object with mass m of one kilogram will accelerate a at the rate of one meter per second per second (1 m/s2)—about one-tenth the acceleration due to Earth's gravityIn professional metrology (the science of measurement), the acceleration of Earth’s gravity is taken as standard gravity (symbol: gn), which is defined as precisely [tpl]val|fmt=commas|9.80665[/tpl][tpl]nbsp[/tpl]meters[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]per square second (m/s2). The expression [tpl]nowrap|“1 m/s2 ”[/tpl] means that for every second that elapses, velocity changes an additional 1 meter per second. In more familiar terms: an acceleration of 1[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]m/s2 can also be expressed as a rate of change in velocity of precisely 3.6 km/h per second (≈2.2 mph per second).
While the weight of an object is dependent upon the strength of the local gravitational field, the mass of an object is independent of gravity.[ref]Matter has invariant mass assuming it is not traveling at a relativistic speed with respect to an observer. According to Einstein’s theory of special relativity, the relativistic mass (apparent mass with respect to an observer) of an object or particle with rest mass m0 increases with its speed as M[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]=[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]γm0 (where γ is the Lorentz factor). This effect is vanishingly small at everyday speeds, which are many orders of magnitude less than the speed of light.  For example, to change the mass of a kilogram by 1 μg (1 ppb, about the level of detection by current technology) would require moving it at 0.0045% of the speed of light relative to an observer, which is 13.4 km/s (30,000 mph).
As regards the kilogram, relativity’s effect upon the constancy of matter’s mass is simply an interesting scientific phenomenon that has zero effect on the definition of the kilogram and its practical realizations.[/ref] Accordingly, for astronauts in microgravity, no effort is required to hold objects off the cabin floor; they are “weightless”. However, since objects in microgravity still retain their mass and inertia, an astronaut must exert ten times as much force to accelerate a 10[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]kilogram object at the same rate as a 1[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]kilogram object.
Because at any given point on Earth the weight of an object is proportional to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale.  The ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.

On 7 April 1795, the gram was decreed in France to be "the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to the cube of the hundredth part of the metre, and at the temperature of melting ice."  The concept of using a unit volume of water to define a unit measure of mass was proposed by the English philosopher John Wilkins in his 1668 essay as a means of linking mass and length.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationLong.pdf |title=An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language (Reproduction) |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-04-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationShort.pdf |title=An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language (Transcription) |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-04-03[/tpl]
Since trade and commerce typically involve items significantly more massive than one gram, and since a mass standard made of water would be inconvenient and unstable, the regulation of commerce necessitated the manufacture of a practical realization of the water-based definition of mass. Accordingly, a provisional mass standard was made as a single-piece, metallic artifact one thousand times as massive as the gram—the kilogram.
At the same time, work was commissioned to precisely determine the mass of a cubic decimeter (one liter) of water.[ref]
The same decree also defined the liter as follows: “Liter: the measure of volume, both for liquid and solids, for which the displacement would be that of a cube sides measuring one-tenth of a meter.” Original text: “[tpl]lang|fr|Litre, la mesure de capacité, tant pour les liquides que pour les matières sèches, dont la contenance sera celle du cube de la dixièrne partie du mètre.[/tpl]”[/ref] Although the decreed definition of the kilogram specified water at 0[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]°C—its highly stable temperature point—the French chemist Louis Lefèvre-Gineau and the Italian naturalist Giovanni Fabbroni after several years of research chose to redefine the standard in 1799 to water’s most stable density point: the temperature at which water reaches maximum density, which was measured at the time as 4[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]°C.Modern measurements show the temperature at which water reaches maximum density is 3.984[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]°C. However, the scientists at the close of the 18th century concluded that the temperature was 4[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]°C.
They concluded that one cubic decimeter of water at its maximum density was equal to 99.9265% of the target mass of the provisional kilogram standard made four years earlier.
[ref]The provisional kilogram standard had been fabricated in accordance with a single, inaccurate measurement of the density of water made earlier by Antoine Lavoisier and René Just Haüy, which showed that one cubic decimeter of distilled water at 0[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]°C had a mass of 18,841 grains in France’s soon-to-be-obsoleted poids de marc system. The newer, highly accurate measurements by Lefèvre[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]Gineau and Fabbroni concluded that the mass of a cubic decimeter of water at the new temperature of 4[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]°C—a condition at which water is denser—was actually less massive, at 18,827.15 grains, than the earlier inaccurate value assumed for 0[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]°C water. 
France’s metric system had been championed by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]Périgord. On 30[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]March 1791, four days after Talleyrand forwarded a specific proposal on how to proceed with the project, the French government ordered a committee known as the Academy to commence work on accurately determining the magnitude of the base units of the new metric system. The Academy divided the task among five commissions. The commission charged with determining the mass of a cubic decimeter of water originally comprised Lavoisier and Haüy but their work was finished by Louis Lefèvre[tpl]nbhyph[/tpl]Gineau and Giovanni Fabbroni. 
Neither Lavoisier nor Haüy can be blamed for participating in an initial—and inaccurate—measurement and for leaving the final work to Lefèvre‑Gineau and Fabbroni to finish in 1799. As a member of the Ferme générale, Lavoisier was also one of France’s 28 tax collectors. He was consequently convicted of treason during the waning days of the Reign of Terror period of the French Revolution and beheaded on 8[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]May 1794. Lavoisier’s partner, Haüy, was also thrown into prison and was himself at risk of going to the guillotine but his life was spared after a renowned French naturalist interceded.[/ref]
