==Critical reception==

"You Know Me Better" was well received by music critics. Peter Paphides of The Times described the song as "a rush of colour slowly surging outwards from a hook of pared-back austerity."[tpl]cite web |last=Paphides |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Paphides |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/cd_reviews/article2589299.ece |title=Roisin Murphy: Overpowered |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |date=5 October 2007 |accessdate=9 July 2010[/tpl] Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars, saying producer Andy Cato "lays down a squelching disco groove that veers between early 90's house and the sound of New Order's 'Blue Monday' being fiddled with by the Human League. A typically sultry Murphy more than rises to the occasion, delivering the crisp, soothing vocals that earned Moloko a flash of chart success at the start of the decade."[tpl]cite web |last=Fletcher |first=Alex |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a91518/roisin-murphy-you-know-me-better.html |title=Roisin Murphy: 'You Know Me Better' |publisher=Digital Spy |accessdate=9 July 2010[/tpl] Jax Spike of About.com noted that the song "is a more up-tempo track that comes across as pure enchanted bliss with its tough, staccato vocal and conventional, insistent chorus concealing a quite complex emotional position."[tpl]cite web |last=Spike |first=Jax |url=http://dancemusic.about.com/od/reviews/fr/Roisin_Murphy_-_Overpowered.htm |title=Roisin Murphy – 'Overpowered' |work=About.com |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=9 July 2010[/tpl] Ben Hogwood, writing for musicOMH, stated, "In some way that pushes it closer to a Groove Armada guest slot, but Murphy's vocals are strong enough to pull it back, a slice of electro-disco that may be polished within an inch of its life, but comes back for more with its yearning melody."[tpl]cite web |last=Hogwood |first=Ben |url=http://www.musicomh.com/singles/roisin-murphy-3_0308.htm |title=Róisín Murphy – You Know Me Better (EMI) |publisher=musicOMH |accessdate=9 July 2010[/tpl] Cpt H.M. 'Howling Mad' Murdock of Drowned in Sound commented that "You Know Me Better" "mirrors Robyn's recent chart achievements in icy cool style."[tpl]cite web |last=Murdock |first=Cpt H.M.
