Frederick George Bluett (1876–1942) was a London-born vaudevillian who came to Australia in 1891 and remained in the region for the rest of his life. Not long after arriving in Australia Bluett left for New Zealand, spending almost a decade working for the Fullers on their Dominion circuit. He returned to Australia in 1902 under contract to Harry Rickards and over the next three decades cemented his reputation as one of the region’s premier comedians. Bluett's children Gus and Kitty also became well-known comedians in their own right.Fred Bluett at Australian Dictionary of BiographyFred Bluett at Australian Variety Theatre Archive
