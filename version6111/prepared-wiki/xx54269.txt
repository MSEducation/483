Zahi Hawass ([tpl]lang-ar|زاهي حواس[/tpl]; born May 28, 1947) is an Egyptian archaeologist, an Egyptologist, and former Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs.[tpl]cite web|title=The Cabinet of Ministers|url=http://www.cabinet.gov.eg/Cabinet/Cabinet.aspx|accessdate=February 25, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703833204576114580200904212.html|title=Egypt's Antiquities Fall Victim to the Mob|last=Joffe|first=Alex|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=February 1, 2011|date=February 1, 2011[/tpl]  He has also worked at archaeological sites in the Nile Delta, the Western Desert, and the Upper Nile Valley.
Hawass has received widespread publicity internationally, and was the subject of a reality television series in the United States, Chasing Mummies. His views and links to business ventures and the Mubarak regime have engendered controversy. In connection with the awarding of a gift shop contract at the Egyptian Museum and alleged smuggling of antiquities, he was sentenced to a prison term, which was later lifted.

==Early life and education==

Hawass was born in Damietta, Egypt. He originally intended to become a lawyer, but then studied Greek and Roman archaeology at Alexandria University, where he obtained a B.Sc. degree. He obtained a diploma in Egyptology at the University of Cairo. In 1987 he received his PhD degree from the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied as a Fulbright Fellow.Zahi A.

==Career==

After 1988 Hawass taught Egyptian archaeology, history and culture, mostly at the American University in Cairo and the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1993 he left his position as Chief Inspector of the Giza Pyramid Plateau. According to Hawass, he resigned.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.egypttoday.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6785|title=From the Notebook of Dr. Zahi Hawass[/tpl] Others[tpl]who|year=November 2010|date=February 2011[/tpl] claim, however, that he was fired because a valuable ancient "statue" under the custody of Hawass was stolen from Giza. He was reinstated as Chief Inspector in early 1994.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dreamscape.com/morgana/hancock.htm|title=The Modern Riddle of the Sphinx[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lauralee.com/sphinx.htm|title=Additional Information on the Giza Plateau from Graham Hancock[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://circulartimes.org/Archaeological%20Geological%20Chamber%20Shaft%20Great%20Pyramid%20Sphinx%20Robert%20Bauval%201997%20Reprint%20from%20Circular%20Times.htm|title=Archaeological Developments at Giza by Robert Bauval[/tpl] In 1998 he was appointed as director of the Giza Plateau. In 2002 he was appointed Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities.
He is also responsible for the discovery of the tombs of Giza pyramid builders, and the Valley of the Golden Mummies in Bahariya. In 2005 as part of the National Geographic Society-sponsored Egyptian Mummy Project to learn more about patterns of disease, health, and mortality in ancient Egypt, he led a team that CT scanned the mummy of King Tutankhamun. His team is continuing to CT scan mummies, both royal and private, and hopes to solve some of the mysteries surrounding the lives and deaths of such important figures as Hatshepsut and Nefertiti.[tpl]cite web|title=Zahi Hawass|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/zahi-hawass/|work=National Geographic|accessdate=September 30, 2013[/tpl]
When U.S. President Barack Obama was in Cairo in June 2009 Hawass gave him personal tours of the sites of ancient Egypt. At the end of 2009 he was promoted personally by President Hosni Mubarak to the post of Vice Minister of Culture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drhawass.com/blog/dr-hawass-named-vice-minister-culture-egypt|title=Dr. Hawass Named Vice Minister of Culture of Egypt|last=Hawass|first=Zahi|work=Dr Hawass|accessdate=August 12, 2010[/tpl]
In the midst of the 2011 Egyptian protests, Hawass arrived at the Egyptian Museum on January 29, 2011 to find that a number of cases had been broken into and a number of antiquities damaged. Police later secured the museum. Hawass was reported to have faxed a colleague that 13 cases were destroyed and to have said, "My heart is broken and my blood is boiling." Hawass later told the New York Times that thieves looking for gold broke 70 objects, including two sculptures of Tutankhamen, and took two skulls from a research lab before being stopped as they were leaving the museum.

===Minister of Antiquities===

He was appointed Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, a newly created cabinet post, by Mubarak on January 31, 2011 as part of a cabinet shakeup during the 2011 Egyptian protests.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/01/archaeologists-hold-their-breath.html?ref=hp|title=Archaeologists Hold Their Breaths on Status of Egyptian Antiquities|last=Lawler|first=Andrew|date=Jan 31, 2011|work=ScienceInsider|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=February 1, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/world/middleeast/02antiquities.html|title=Egyptian Official, Zahi Hawass, Says Antiquities Are Secure|last=Taylor|first=Kate|date=February 2, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 2, 2011[/tpl]
In a blog on his website it was reported that Hawass "will continue excavating, writing books, and representing his country."  Hawass' blog said that archeological sites in Egypt were being safeguarded and that looted objects had been returned. Regarding the Egyptian Museum looting, he said that "The museum was dark and the nine robbers did not recognise the value of what was in the vitrines. They opened thirteen cases, threw the seventy objects on the ground and broke them, including one Tutankhamun case, from which they broke the statue of the king on a panther. However, the broken objects can all be restored, and we will begin the restoration process this week."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drhawass.com/blog/state-egyptian-antiquities-today-update|title=The State of Egyptian Antiquities Today: An Update|date=Feb 1, 2011|work=Dr.hawass.com|accessdate=February 1, 2011[/tpl] Hawass rejected comparisons with the looting of antiquities in Iraq and Afghanistan.
On February 13 Hawass said that eighteen artifacts, including statues of King Tutankhamun, were stolen from the Egyptian Museum in January. Among them were eleven wooden shabti statuettes from Yuya, a gilded wooden statue of Tutankhamun carried by a goddess and a statue of Nefertiti.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-13/egyptian-museum-says-two-king-tut-statues-missing-update1-.html|title=King Tutankhamun Statues Missing as Intruders Break Into Egyptian Museum|last=Kassem|first=Mahmoud|date=February 13, 2011|work=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=February 13, 2011[/tpl]
Egyptian state television reported that Hawass called upon Egyptians not to believe the “lies and fabrications” of the Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya satellite television channels.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/world/middleeast/01statetv.html|title=State TV in Egypt Offers Different Perspective|last=Fahim|first=Kareem|date=February 1, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 1, 2011[/tpl] Hawass later said “They should give us the opportunity to change things, and if nothing happens they can march again. But you can’t bring in a new president now, in this time. We need Mubarak to stay and make the transition.”
On March 3, 2011 he resigned after a list was posted on his personal website of dozens of sites across Egypt that were looted in the 2011 protests.[tpl]cite news|last=Taylor|first=Kate|title=Egyptian Antiquities Chief Says He Will Resign|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/egyptian-antiquities-chief-resigns/|accessdate=March 3, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 3, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drhawass.com/blog/status-egyptian-antiquities-today-3-march-2011|title=The status of Egyptian antiquities today, 3 March 2011 |last=Hawass|first=Zahi|date=March 3, 2011|work=drhawass.com|accessdate=July 15, 2011[/tpl] On March 30, 2011 a tweet was posted stating that he was once again the Minister of Antiquities ("I am very happy to be the Minister of Antiquities once again!").http://twitter.com/#!/ZahiHawass He was reappointed by Prime Minister Essam Sharaf at that time,[tpl]cite news|last=Taylor|first=Kate|title=Egyptian Antiquities Minister Returns Less Than a Month After Quitting|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/egypts-antiquities-minister-rehired-less-than-a-month-after-leaving/|accessdate=March 30, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 30, 2011[/tpl] but resigned on July 17, 2011, after Sharaf informed him he would not be continuing in the position. According to other newspaper reports, he was sacked from his job.Sacking Zahi Hawass is a sign of Egypt's ongoing revolution. The Guardian, Friday 22 July 2011.

===Return of artifacts to Egypt===

Hawass spearheaded a movement to return many prominent unique and/or irregularly taken Ancient Egyptian artifacts, such as the Rosetta Stone, the bust of Nefertiti, the Dendera zodiac ceiling painting from the Dendera Temple, the bust of Ankhhaf (the architect of the Khafra Pyramid), the faces of Amenhotep III's tomb at the Louvre Museum, the Luxor Temple's obelisk at the Place de la Concorde and the statue of Hemiunu, nephew of the Pharaoh Khufu, builder of the largest pyramid, to Egypt from collections in various other countries. In July 2003 the Egyptians requested the return of the Rosetta Stone from the British Museum. Hawass, as Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Cairo, told the press, "If the British want to be remembered, if they want to restore their reputation, they should volunteer to return the Rosetta Stone because it is the icon of our Egyptian identity."[tpl]cite news|author=Charlotte Edwardes and Catherine Milner|title=Egypt demands return of the Rosetta Stone|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=July 20, 2003|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/1436606/Egypt-demands-return-of-the-Rosetta-Stone.html|accessdate =August 12, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Henry Huttinger|title = Stolen Treasures: Zahi Hawass wants the Rosetta Stone back, among other things|work=Cairo Magazine|date=July 28, 2005|url=http://www.cairomagazine.com/?module=displaystory&story_id=1238&format=html|accessdate=October 6, 2006[/tpl] Referring to antiquities at the British Museum, Hawass said “These are Egyptian monuments. I will make life miserable for anyone who keeps them.” Britain has refused to return them.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-26/egypt-relics-chief-pulls-in-revenue-as-he-fights-for-nefertiti.html|title=Egypt Relics Chief Pulls in Revenue as He Fights for Nefertiti|last=Williams|first=Daniel|date=Jan 27, 2010|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=August 12, 2010[/tpl]
The Wall Street Journal commented that the looting of antiquities during the 2011 civil unrest in Egypt made Hawass' quest to return Egyptian antiquities to Egypt "misguided or at least poorly timed."

===Opposition to Afrocentrists===

He is opposed to the claims of Afrocentrists.[tpl]cite web|url=http://touregypt.net/teblog/egyptologynews/?p=2929|title="Egyptology News" Blog Archive, "Hawass says that Tutankhamun was not black"|work=Tour Egypt|accessdate=October 1, 2012[/tpl] According to Hawass, "Tutankhamun was not black, and the portrayal of ancient Egyptian civilization as black has no element of truth to it."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=f50_1279175755|title=Tutankhamun Was Not Black: Egypt Antiquities Chief Zahi Hawass|publisher=LiveLeak|accessdate=October 1, 2012[/tpl]

===DNA testing of Egyptian mummies===

Hawass has been skeptical of DNA testing of Egyptian mummies: "From what I understand, it is not always accurate and it cannot always be done with complete success when dealing with mummies. Until we know for sure that it is accurate, we will not use it in our research."[tpl]cite web|title=Unravelling the Mummy Mystery – Using DNA (citing Interview with al-Ahram issue 512.)|publisher=Egyptology Online|url=http://www.egyptologyonline.com/using_dna.htm|accessdate=April 10, 2009[/tpl]
In December 2000, a joint team from Waseda University in Japan and Cairo's Ain Shams University tried to get permission for DNA testing of Egyptian mummies, but was denied by the Egyptian Government.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl] Hawass added that DNA analysis was out of the question because it would not lead to anything.[tpl]cite web|title=Unravelling the Mummy Mystery – Using DNA (citing Interview with "Travel Egypt" magazine, 2004.)|publisher=Egyptology Online|url= http://www.egyptologyonline.com/using_dna.htm|accessdate=April 10, 2009[/tpl]
In February 2010, Hawass and his team announced that they had analyzed the mummies of Tutankhamun and ten other mummies and said that the king could have died from a malaria infection that followed a leg fracture.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8516425.stm|title='Malaria and weak bones' may have killed Tutankhamun |last=Roberts|first=Michelle|date=February 17, 2010|work=BBC|accessdate=February 17, 2010[/tpl] German researchers Christian Timmann and Christian Meyer have cast doubt on this theory, suggesting other speculative alternatives for Tutankhamun's cause of death.Malaria, mummies, mutations: Tutankhamun's archaeological autopsy. Trop Med Int Health. 2010 Nov; 15 (11): 1278-80.

===Statements about Israel and Jews===

Hawass has been a long-standing opponent of normalized relations between Israel and Egypt.
In January 2009 Hawass wrote in Al-Sharq Al-Awsat that "The concept of killing women, children and elderly people ... seems to run in the blood of the Jews of Palestine" and that "the only thing that the Jews have learned from history is methods of tyranny and torment — so much so that they have become artists in this field."  He explained that he was not referring to the Jews' "original faith" but rather "the faith that they forged and contaminated with their poison, which is aimed against all of mankind."Antisemitic Statements and Cartoons in Wake of Gaza War, MEMRI, March 30, 2009.
In an interview on Egyptian television in April 2009 Hawass stated that "although Jews are few in number, they control the entire world" and commented on the "control they have" of the American economy and the media.The Jews' secret weapon: Bickering Jonathan Kay, National Post, April 20, 2009.Video Clip: Renowned Egyptian Archeologist Zahi Hawass: Jews Control the Entire World, MEMRI, March 30, 2009.Renowned Egyptian Archeologist Zahi Hawass: Jews Control the Entire World, MEMRI, Clip No. 2049 — transcript, February 11, 2009. He later clarified that he was using rhetoric to explain political fragmentation among the Arabs and that he does not believe in a "Jewish conspiracy to control the world".Clarification of Remarks on Jewish History, Zahi Hawass's blog.

==Controversies==

Hawass has been accused of domineering behaviour, forbidding archaeologists to announce their own findings, and courting the media for his own gain after they were denied access to archaeological sites because, according to Hawass, they were too amateurish.The Show-Biz Pharaoh of Egypt's Antiquities. Sharon Waxman. New York Times. June 13, 2005. A few, however, have said in interviews that some of what Hawass has done for the field was long overdue. Hawass has typically ignored or dismissed his critics, and when asked about it he indicated that what he does is for the sake of Egypt and the preservation of its antiquities.Parker, Ian (2009), "The Pharaoh", The New Yorker, November 16 issue, pp 53–63. Hawass helped to institute a systematic program for the preservation and restoration of historical monuments, while training Egyptians to improve their expertise on methods of excavation, retrieval and preservation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hawass|first=Zahi|title=A New Era for Museums in Egypt|journal=Museum International|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell Synergy|date=May 2005|issue=1–2| volume=57|pages=7–23|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0033.2005.00505.x[/tpl]
Criticism of Hawass increased following the protests in Egypt in 2011. The New York Times reported in a front page story in July 2011 that he receives an honorarium each year "of as much as $200,000" from National Geographic to be an explorer-in-residence, "even as he controls access to the ancient sites it often features in its reports."
The Times also reported that he has relationships with two American companies that do business in Egypt.
On April 17, 2011, Hawass was sentenced to jail for one year for refusing to obey a court ruling relating to a contract for the gift shop at the Egyptian Museum to a company with links to Hawass. The ruling was appealed and this specific sentence was suspended pending appeal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/201141720122512511.html |title=Egypt antiquities chief faces jail time - Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01[/tpl] The following day, the National Council of Egypt’s Administrative Court issued a decree to overturn the court's original ruling, specifying that he would serve no jail time, and would instead remain in his position as Minister of Antiquities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drhawass.com/blog/decision-court-case-against-me?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Drhawasscom-New+%28DrHawass.com+-+What%27s+new%3F+Feed%29|title=Decision in the Court Case Against Me |last=Hawass|first=Zahi|work=Drhawass.com|accessdate=April 19, 2011[/tpl]. The jail sentence was lifted after a new contract was solicited for the gift shop

===Association with former Egyptian President Mubarak===

Hawass has been closely associated with the government of former President Hosni Mubarak. He was a member of the government as Minister of Antiquities during Mubarak's presidency. His resignation as minister on March 3, 2011 and his re-appointment to the Ministry on March 30, 2011 have been seen as part of the overall events surrounding Mubarak's resignation. It has been reported that his appointment has angered numerous factions, who have opposed the appointment of any of the old guard under Mubarak to new positions in the government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=214426|title=Breaking News |work=Jerusalem Post|date=March 30, 2011|accessdate=October 1, 2012[/tpl]
The 2011 Egyptian protests resulted in increased criticism of Hawass. Demonstrators called for his resignation, and the upheaval has increased attention on his relationship with the Mubarak family and the way in which he has increased his public profile in recent years.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/world/middleeast/13hawass.html|title=Revolt in Egypt Dims Star Power of Zahi Hawass|last=Taylor|first=Kate|date=July 13, 2011|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=July 14, 2011[/tpl]

===Maimonides Synagogue incident===

In March 2010 Hawass canceled the official re-opening of the restored Maimonides Synagogue in Cairo. In his email cancellation message issued in Arabic he described the Jewish dedication ceremony on March 7, which included dancing and serving wine, as "provocation to the feelings of hundreds of millions of Muslims in Egypt and around the world". In an English-language statement issued a few hours later the remarks about "drinking and dancing" were removed.[tpl]cite web |title= Egypt Scraps Synagogue Ceremony |url= http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-14/egypt-scraps-synagogue-ceremony-after-dancing-and-drinking.html |work=Business week|date=March 14, 2010[/tpl] Hawass said that the decision was made at "a time when Muslim holy sites in occupied Palestine face assaults from Israeli occupation forces and settlers".[tpl]cite web|title=Egypt scraps synagogue ceremony after 'provocative' acts|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100314-egypt-scraps-synagogue-ceremony-after-provocative-acts-0|work=France 24|date=March 14, 2010[/tpl] He later also said that canceling the ceremony was a "strong slap in the face" to "the Zionist enemy"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1159674.html |title=Egypt antiquities chief: I gave the Zionist enemy a slap in the face |publisher=Haaretz |accessdate=March 30, 2010 [/tpl] and that he would "not allow any Jew to pray in the temple, and would not allow any Israeli to pray in the temple.”[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/136755 |title=Jews Barred from Cairo's Maimonides Synagogue|work=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=August 12, 2010 [/tpl]  A private dedication ceremony closed to media was held instead for approximately 150 European Jews with historical ties to Egypt in attendance.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

===Clothing line===

Hawass has lent his name to a line of men's apparel, described by The New York Times as "a line of rugged khakis, denim shirts and carefully worn leather jackets that are meant, according to the catalog copy, to hark 'back to Egypt’s golden age of discovery in the early 20th century.'" The clothing was first sold at Harrods department store in London in April 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/arts/design/egyptian-antiquities-official-defends-fashion-line.html|title=Egyptian Antiquities Official Defends Fashion Line|last=Taylor|first=Kate|date=April 19, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 19, 2011[/tpl]
Critics say the Hawass clothing commercializes Egyptian history and there were accusations, which proved incorrect [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl], that models had sat on or scuffed ancient artifacts during a photo shoot for advertisements. Hawass already sells a line of hats similar to the ones he wears, which mimic the ones worn by Harrison Ford in the Indiana Jones movies.

==Recognition and awards==

Hawass is the recipient of the Egyptian state award of the first degree for his work in the Sphinx restoration project. In 2002, he was awarded the American Academy of Achievements' Golden Plate and the glass obelisk from US scholars for his efforts to the protection and preservation of Ancient Egyptian monuments. In 2003, Hawass was given international membership in the Russian Academy for Natural Sciences (RANS). In 2006, Hawass was chosen as one of the world's 100 most influential people by Time magazine in 2006.[tpl]cite journal|author=Nevine El Aref|title=He made it in Time|journal=Al Ahram Weekly|date=May 4–10, 2006|volume=793|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/793/eg10.htm|accessdate=January 3, 2014[/tpl]
