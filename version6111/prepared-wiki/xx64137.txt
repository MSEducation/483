[[Sainte-Laguë method]]

CATEGORIES: Party-list PR

The Sainte-Laguë method ([tpl]IPA-fr|sɛ̃t.la.ɡy[/tpl]) is a highest quotient method for allocating seats in party-list proportional representation used in many voting systems. It is named after the French mathematician André Sainte-Laguë. The Sainte-Laguë method is quite similar to the D'Hondt method, but uses different divisors. In most cases the largest remainder method delivers almost identical results. The D'Hondt method gives similar results too, but favors larger parties compared to the Sainte-Laguë method.[tpl]citation|contribution=Degrees of proportionality of proportional representation formulas|first=Arend|last=Lijphart|authorlink=Arend Lijphart|pages=170–179|title=Electoral Laws and Their Political Consequences|volume=1|series=Agathon series on representation|editor1-first=Bernard|editor1-last=Grofman|editor2-first=Arend|editor2-last=Lijphart|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2003|isbn=9780875862675[/tpl]. See in particular the section "Sainte-Lague", pp. 174–175.
The Sainte-Laguë method is used in Iraq, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Latvia, Kosovo, and Germany (on federal level for the Bundestag, on state level for the legislatures of Baden-Württemberg, Hamburg, Bremen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein and Rhineland-Palatinate). It was also used in Bolivia in 1993, in Poland in 2001, and in the elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006. A variant of this method, the modified Sainte-Laguë method, was used to allocate the proportional representation (PR) seats in the Constituent Assembly poll of Nepal in 2008. It has been proposed by the Green Party in Ireland as a reform for use in Dáil Éireann elections,Ireland's Green Party website; and by the United Kingdom Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2011 as the method for calculating the distribution of seats in elections to the country's upper house of parliament.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/house-of-lords-reform-draft-bill.pdf |format=PDF |date=May 2011 |title=House of Lords Reform Draft Bill |publisher=Cabinet Office |page=16[/tpl]

==Description of the method==

After all the votes have been tallied, successive quotients are calculated for each party. The formula for the quotient is
where:
Whichever party has the highest quotient gets the next seat allocated, and their quotient is recalculated given their new seat total. The process is repeated until all seats have been allocated.
The Sainte-Laguë method does not ensure that a party receiving more than half the votes will win at least half the seats; nor does its modified form.[tpl]citation|contribution=Election inversions under proportional representation|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~nmiller/RESEARCH/NRMILLER.PCS2013.pdf|first=Nicholas R.|last=Miller|date=February 2013|title=Annual Meeting of the Public Choice Society, New Orleans, March 8-10, 2013[/tpl]. For example, with seven seats available and the votes split 53,000, 24,000 and 23,000, the allocation would be three, two and two seats respectively.

==Sainte-Laguë and Webster==

The Sainte-Laguë method is equivalent to the Webster method (named after its proponent, the U.S. senator Daniel Webster) in that they always give the same results, but the method of calculating the apportionment seems to be quite different.[tpl]citation|title=International Encyclopedia of Political Science, Volume 1|editor1-first=Bertrand|editor1-last=Badie|editor2-first=Dirk|editor2-last=Berg-Schlosser|editor3-first=Leonardo|editor3-last=Morlino|publisher=SAGE|year=2011|isbn=9781412959636|page=754|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t0JZp-jrotQC&pg=PA754|quotation=Mathematically, divisor methods for allocating seats to parties on the basis of party vote shares are identical to divisor methods for allocating seats to geographic units on the basis of the unit's share of the total population. ... Similarly, the Sainte-Laguë method is identical to a method devised by the American legislator Daniel Webster.[/tpl] Webster invented his method for legislative apportionment (allocating legislative seats to regions based on their share of the population) rather than elections (allocating legislative seats to parties based on their share of the votes) but this makes no difference to the calculations in the method.
Webster's method is defined in terms of a Droop quota as in the largest remainder method; in this method, the quota is called a "divisor". For a given value of the divisor, the population count for each region is divided by this divisor and then rounded to give the number of legislators to allocate to that region. In order to make the total number of legislators come out equal to the target number, the divisor is adjusted to make the sum of allocated seats after being rounded give the required total.
One way to determine the correct value of the divisor would be to start with a very large divisor, so that no seats are allocated after rounding. Then the divisor may be successively decreased until one seat, two seats, three seats and finally the total number of seats are allocated. The number of allocated seats for a given region increases from s to s + 1 exactly when the divisor equals the population of the region divided by s + 1/2, so at each step the next region to get a seat will be the one with the largest value of this quotient. That means that this successive adjustment method for implementing Webster's method allocates seats in the same order to the same regions as the Sainte-Laguë method would allocate them.

==Modified Sainte-Laguë method==

Some countries, e.g. Nepal, Norway and Sweden, change the quotient formula for parties that have not yet been allocated any seats (s = 0) from V to V/1.4. That is, the modified method changes the sequence of divisors used in this method from (1, 3, 5, 7, ...) to (1.4, 3, 5, 7, ...). This gives slightly larger preference to the larger parties over parties that would earn, with small margin, only a single seat if unmodified Sainte-Laguë's method were used. With the modified method, such small parties do not get any seat; these seats are instead given to a larger party.
Norway further amends this system by utilizing a two-tier proportionality. The number of members to be returned from each of Norway's 19 constituencies (counties) depends on the population and area of the county: each inhabitant counts one point, while each square kilometer counts 1.8 points. Furthermore, one seat from each constituency is allocated according to the national distribution of votes.Norway's Ministry of Local Government website; Stortinget; General Elections; The main features of the Norwegian electoral system; accessed 22 August 2009
