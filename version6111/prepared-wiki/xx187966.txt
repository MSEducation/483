Suranaree Wittaya School is a secondary school in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand. Named for the city's famed 19th century heroine Thao Suranari, it is "Nakhon Ratchasima's top school" according to The Nation newspaper.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/03/opinion/opinion_30028381.php|title=Bad habits die hard in public-school admissions|date=2007-03-03|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=The Nation|author=Veena Thoopkrajae[/tpl] It is also oversubscribed, and in March 2007, saw 500 applicants for 480 places at the school.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/20/national/national_30027321.php|title=Big bribes still on offer: schools|accessdate=2008-05-10|date=2007-02-28|publisher=The Nation''[/tpl] Due to the school's popularity, headmaster Silpasit Taptipthongchai has said that some parents have offered "huge amounts of cash to secure places for their children." It is a girls' high school for Grade 7 up to Grade 12, and was founded on 11 May 1905. In Grade 10 students have the choice to complete a major in English-Chinese, Science-Mathematics, or Home Art.
The school's marching band placed first in the 16th World Music Contest in the Netherlands in 2009. However, it is not certain that Suranaree Wittaya School will be able to defend its title this year due to lack of funds.http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/342632/korat-marching-band-may-withdraw-to-defend-its-championship
