==Critical reception==

"Little Bit" received positive reviews from many music critics. In a review for Blogcritics, Tan The Man wrote that the song is "mesmerizing, evoking a sensual striptease fantasy by a former love" and that it "fuses so many sounds, from quasi-bossa nova to soul, while maintaining a simplistic and raw, non-explicitly erotic beat in the background."[tpl]cite web |author=Tan The Man |url=http://blogcritics.org/music/article/music-review-lykke-li-little-bit/ |title=Music Review: Lykke Li – Little Bit EP |work=Blogcritics |publisher=Technorati |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=23 January 2011[/tpl] Matthew Perpetua from Spin rated the track seven out of ten, stating it is "built upon the clack and clang of acoustic percussion and little else, aside from occasional bits of guitar or saxophone", addind that it sounds "exceptionally intimate, to the point where it's easy to feel voyeuristic when listening on the title cut to her unguarded declaration of love."[tpl]cite web |last=Perpetua |first=Matthew |url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/lykke-li-little-bit-ep-ll |title=Lykke Li, 'Little Bit EP' |work=Spin |publisher=Spin Media LLC |accessdate=23 January 2011[/tpl] Q magazine noticed "a breathless intensity to the lyrics that takes the song beyond the realm of throwaway pop. 'I would do it, push the button, pull the trigger, jump of a cliff...' she sings, clearly not just 'a little bit' in love as she tries to convince herself, but rather in the grip of an overwhelming infatuation."[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.qthemusic.com/2007/12/track_of_the_day_135.html |title=Track of the Day: Lykke Li |work=Q |publisher=Bauer Media Group |date=10 December 2007 |accessdate=23 January 2011[/tpl] Jon Lusk of BBC Music called it "metronomic, infectiously hummable" and viewed it as "a great new example of the emotional conflict which 10cc and Smokey Robinson lyrically documented so well."[tpl]cite web |last=Lusk |first=Jon |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/683n |title=Review of Lykke Li – Youth Novels |work=BBC Music |publisher=BBC Online |date=6 June 2008 |accessdate=23 January 2011[/tpl] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters felt that the song's "approach is far more subtle that most contemporary pop singles would ever dare to be, its gentle, slightly distorted bass synth propelled by the faintest traces of percussion, both electronic and acoustic, Yttling providing mandolin accents during the chouses. But it's Lykke Li who commands our attention, delivering as perfect a hook in the chorus that rivals Robyn's best work, but not before making us fall off our chairs with a second verse that tosses aside all nuance in favor of direct, unadulterated lust."[tpl]cite web |last=Begrand |first=Adrien |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/lykke-li-youth-novels/ |title=Lykke Li: Youth Novels |publisher=PopMatters |date=26 March 2008 |accessdate=23 January 2011[/tpl] Rolling Stone[tpl]'[/tpl]s Will Hermes opined that "a quietly intoxicating electropulse drives the reluctant lover's confession in 'Little Bit' while Li memorably rhymes 'legs apart' with 'tainted heart.'"[tpl]cite web |last=Hermes |first=Will |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/22190049/review/22209192/youth_novels |title=Youth Novels : Lykke Li |work=Rolling Stone |publisher=RealNetworks, Inc |date=21 August 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822220137/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/22190049/review/22209192/youth_novels |archivedate=22 August 2008 |accessdate=23 January 2011[/tpl]
