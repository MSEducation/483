CATEGORIES: Highways in Puerto Rico

Puerto Rico Highway 206 is a connector in Cayey, Puerto Rico that bypasses the downtown area of Cayey, making easier for drivers who do not want to access the congested area of the business center to directly go from Puerto Rico Highway 1 to Puerto Rico Highway 14 to Aibonito, Puerto Rico. Like Puerto Rico Highway 203 and future Puerto Rico Highway 204, PR-206 has two lanes per direction and is about 8 km long.
