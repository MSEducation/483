SpareFoot is an Austin-based company that provides listings for self-storage units. The company was originally a person-to-person model, similar to Airbnb, that later developed into a marketplace for self-storage. The company now facilitates self-storage rentals between consumers and storage operators. The company was profiled as one of America's Most Promising Startups by Bloomberg Businessweek in 2011.[tpl]cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =America’s Most Promising Startups | newspaper =Bloomberg Businessweek| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =25 August 2011 | url =http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20110211/america-s-most-promising-startups | accessdate =27 June 2013 [/tpl]

==History==

SpareFoot was founded in 2008 by Chuck Gordon and Mario Feghali while both were attending UCLA.[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Today’s Featured Member, Sparefoot Started With A Guy Who Needed To Store His Stuff | work = | publisher =Startup American Partnership | date = | url =http://www.s.co/content/todays-featured-member-sparefoot | format = | doi = | accessdate =27 June 2013 [/tpl] The concept was developed a year prior when Gordon was attending UCLA and left to spend a semester in Singapore.[tpl]cite news | last =Quesada | first =Tony | coauthors = | title =Journal Profile: Chuck Gordon, CEO, Sparefoot Inc | newspaper =Austin Business Journal| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =29 July 2011 | url =http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/print-edition/2011/07/29/journal-profile-chuck-gordon.html?page=all | accessdate =27 June 2013 [/tpl] Gordon used space in Feghali's residence as well as space in girlfriend's garage. While away, Gordon came up with the concept which he pursued with Feghali. SpareFoot was originally formed as a person-to-person website with the concept of facilitating the rental of extra storage space in private residences to those looking for storage. 
Original funding came from family members and friends. The site failed to gain traction with a person-to-person model. The founders noticed that there were more storage companies signing up to sell space as opposed to homeowners. The site was re-branded (along with a name change from Homstie to SpareFoot) and began allowing customers to find, compare and review potential storage providers.  
Additional funding for SpareFoot came in 2009 when the company was accepted into an incubator program at Capital Factory in Austin, Texas.[tpl]cite news | last =Higginbotham | first =Stacey | coauthors = | title =Austin’s Capital Factory Incubator Bets  on Consumer Startups | newspaper =New York Times | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =22 April 2009 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/external/gigaom/2009/04/22/22gigaom-austins-capital-factory-incubator-bets-on-consume-46728.html | accessdate =27 June 2013 [/tpl] They were awarded $20,000 seed capital as well as mentoring from the program.
