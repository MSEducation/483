[[Linear prediction]]

CATEGORIES: Time series analysis, Signal processing, Estimation theory

Linear prediction is a mathematical operation where future values of a discrete-time signal are estimated as a linear function of previous samples.
In digital signal processing, linear prediction is often called linear predictive coding (LPC) and can thus be viewed as a subset of filter theory. In system analysis (a subfield of mathematics), linear prediction can be viewed as a part of mathematical modelling or optimization.

===Estimating the parameters===

for 1 ≤ j ≤ p, where R is the autocorrelation of signal xn, defined as
and E is the expected value.  In the multi-dimensional case this corresponds to minimizing the L2 norm.
The above equations are called the normal equations or Yule-Walker equations. In matrix form the equations can be equivalently written as
where the autocorrelation matrix R is a symmetric, p×p Toeplitz matrix with elements ri,j = R(i − j), 0≤i,j j = R(j), 0 Another, more general, approach is to minimize the sum of squares of the errors defined in the form
On the other hand, if the mean square prediction error is constrained to be unity and the prediction error equation is included on top of the normal equations, the augmented set of equations is obtained as
where the index i ranges from 0 to p, and R is a (p + 1) × (p + 1) matrix.
Specification of the parameters of the linear predictor is a wide topic and a large number of other approaches have been proposed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] In fact, the autocorrelation method is the most common and it is used, for example, for speech coding in the GSM standard.
Solution of the matrix equation Ra = r is computationally a relatively expensive process. The Gauss algorithm for matrix inversion is probably the oldest solution but this approach does not efficiently use the symmetry of R and r. A faster algorithm is the Levinson recursion proposed by Norman Levinson in 1947, which recursively calculates the solution.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] In particular, the autocorrelation equations above may be more efficiently solved by the Durbin algorithm.M. A. Ramirez (2008) "A Levinson Algorithm Based on an Isometric Transformation of Durbin's," IEEE Signal Processing Lett., vol. 15, pp. 99-102.
Later, Delsarte et al. proposed an improvement to this algorithm called the split Levinson recursion which requires about half the number of multiplications and divisions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] It uses a special symmetrical property of parameter vectors on subsequent recursion levels. That is, calculations for the optimal predictor containing p terms make use of similar calculations for the optimal predictor containing p − 1 terms.
Another way of identifying model parameters is to iteratively calculate state estimates using Kalman filters and obtaining maximum likelihood estimates within Expectation–maximization algorithms.
