[[Cerebral cortex]]

CATEGORIES: Cerebrum, Neuroanatomy

The cerebral cortex is the outermost layered structure of neural tissue of the cerebrum (brain), in humans and other mammals. It covers the cerebrum, and is divided into two cortices, along the sagittal plane, covering the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The medial longitudinal fissure is a deep groove that separates these two hemispheres. The cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language, and consciousness.  The neocortex which is the major part of the cortex, consists of up to six horizontal layers, each  with a different composition in terms of neurons and connectivity. The human cerebral cortex is [tpl]convert|2|to|4|mm[/tpl] thick.[ref]

It is referred to as grey matter as it consists of cell bodies and capillaries and contrasts with the underlying white matter, that consists mainly of the white myelinated sheaths of neuronal axons.
In large mammals the surface of the cerebral cortex is folded, giving a much greater surface area in a confined space as in the skull. A fold or ridge in the cortex is termed a gyrus (plural gyri) and a groove or fissure is termed a sulcus (plural sulci).  In the human brain more than two-thirds is buried in the sulci.  The phylogenetically most recent part of the cerebral cortex, the neocortex (also called isocortex), is differentiated into six horizontal layers; the more ancient part of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, has at most three cellular layers. Neurons in various layers connect vertically to form small microcircuits, called cortical columns. Different neocortical regions known as Brodmann areas are distinguished by variations in their cytoarchitectonics (histological structure).

==Structure==

===Layered structure===

The different cortical layers each contain a characteristic distribution of neuronal cell types and connections with other cortical and subcortical regions. One of the clearest examples of cortical layering is the Stria of Gennari in the primary visual cortex. This is a band of whiter tissue that can be observed with the naked eye in the fundus of the calcarine sulcus of the occipital lobe. The Stria of Gennari is composed of axons bringing visual information from the thalamus into layer four of the visual cortex.
Staining cross-sections of the cortex to reveal the position of neuronal cell bodies and the intracortical axon tracts allowed neuroanatomists in the early 20th century to produce a detailed description of the laminar structure of the cortex in different species. After the work of Korbinian Brodmann (1909) the neurons of the cerebral cortex are grouped into six main layers, from outside (pial surface) to inside (white matter):
It is important to note that the cortical layers are not simply stacked one over the other; there exists characteristic connections between different layers and neuronal types, which span all the thickness of the cortex. These cortical microcircuits are grouped into cortical columns and minicolumns, the latter of which have been proposed to be the basic functional units of cortex.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1093/brain/120.4.701 | author = Mountcastle V | year = 1997 | title = The columnar organization of the neocortex | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 120 | issue = 4| pages = 701–722 | pmid = 9153131 [/tpl] In 1957, Vernon Mountcastle showed that the functional properties of the cortex change abruptly between laterally adjacent points; however, they are continuous in the direction perpendicular to the surface. Later works have provided evidence of the presence of functionally distinct cortical columns in the visual cortex (Hubel and Wiesel, 1959),[tpl]cite journal |author=HUBEL DH, WIESEL TN |title=Receptive fields of single neurones in the cat's striate cortex |journal=J.

and associative cortex.
Cortical areas that lack a layer IV are called agranular. Cortical areas that have only a rudimentary layer IV are called dysgranular.S.M. Dombrowski , C.C. Hilgetag , and H. Barbas. Quantitative Architecture Distinguishes Prefrontal Cortical Systems in the Rhesus Monkey.Cereb. Cortex 11: 975-988. "...they either lack (agranular) or have only a rudimentary granular layer IV (dysgranular)." Information processing within each layer is determined by different temporal dynamics with that in the layers II/III having a slow 2 Hz oscillation while that in layer V having a fast 10–15 Hz one.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sun W, Dan Y | year = 2009 | title = Layer-specific network oscillation and spatiotemporal receptive field in the visual cortex | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 106 | issue = 42| pages = 17986–17991 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0903962106 | pmc = 2764922 | pmid = 19805197 [/tpl]

===Areas===

Based on the differences in lamination the cerebral cortex can be classified into two major parts, the neocortex and the allocortex:
Auxiliary classes are:
In addition, the cortex may be classified on the basis of gross topographical conventions into four lobes: the temporal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe and frontal lobe:

===Development===

The cerebral cortex develops from the most anterior part of the neural plate, a specialized part of the embryonic ectoderm.[tpl]cite web | pmid=10498281 | title =The transcription factor, Pax6, is required for cell proliferation and differentiation in the developing cerebral cortex | author =Natasha Warren, Damira Caric1, Thomas Pratt, Julia A. Clausen, Pundit Asavaritikrai, John O. Mason, Robert E. Hill, David J. Price | author2 =Oxford Journals | pages =627–635 | publisher =National Institutes of Health | year =1999[/tpl] The neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube. From the cavity inside the neural tube develops the ventricular system, and, from the epithelial cells of its walls, the neurons and glia of the nervous system. The most anterior (front, or cranial) part of the neural plate, the prosencephalon, which is evident before neurulation begins, gives rise to the cerebral hemispheres and its later cortex.Larsen, W J.

The development of the neocortex arises in an inside-out manner as mitotically dividing progenitor cells migrate outward along radial glia.  The first neurons to differentiate migrate to what will become Layer VI.  As the G1 phase [tpl]clarify|date=November 2013[/tpl] of mitosis is elongated, the newly-born neurons migrate to more superficial layers of the cortex.[tpl]cite journal|last=Calegari|first=F|author2=Haubensack W|author3=Haffner C|author4=Huttner WB|title=Selective lengthening of the cell cycle in the neurogenic subpopulation of neural progenitor cells during mouse brain development.|journal=J Neurosci.|year=2005|volume=25|issue=28|pages=6533–8[/tpl]
Cortical neurons are generated within the ventricular zone, next to the ventricles. At first, this zone contains progenitor cells, which divide to produce glial cells and neurons. The glial fibers produced in the first divisions of the progenitor cells are radially oriented, spanning the thickness of the cortex from the ventricular zone to the outer, pial surface, and provide scaffolding for the migration of neurons outwards from the ventricular zone. The first divisions of the progenitor cells are symmetric, which duplicates the total number of progenitor cells at each mitotic cycle. Then, some progenitor cells begin to divide asymmetrically, producing one postmitotic cell that migrates along the radial glial fibers, leaving the ventricular zone, and one progenitor cell, which continues to divide until the end of development, when it differentiates into a glial cell or an ependymal cell. The migrating daughter cells become the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex. The development process is time ordered and regulated by hundreds of genes and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.
The layered structure of the mature cerebral cortex is formed during development. The first pyramidal neurons generated migrate out of the ventricular zone and subventricular zone, together with reelin producing Cajal–Retzius neurons, from the preplate. Next, a cohort of neurons migrating into the middle of the preplate divides this transient layer into the superficial marginal zone, which will become layer one of the mature neocortex, and the subplate, forming a middle layer called the cortical plate. These cells will form the deep layers of the mature cortex, layers five and six. Later born neurons migrate radially into the cortical plate past the deep layer neurons, and become the upper layers (two to four). Thus, the layers of the cortex are created in an inside-out order. The only exception to this inside-out sequence of neurogenesis occurs in the layer I of primates, in which, in contrast to rodents, neurogenesis continues throughout the entire period of corticogenesis.

===Thickness===

For mammals, species with larger brains (in absolute terms, not just in relation to body size) tend to have thicker cortices.  The range, however, is not very great — only a factor of 7 between the thickest and thinnest cortices.  The smallest mammals, such as shrews, have a neocortical thickness of about 0.5 mm; the ones with the largest brains, such as humans and fin whales, have thicknesses of 2.3—2.8 mm.  There is an approximately logarithmic relationship between brain weight and cortical thickness.[tpl]cite book|title=The central nervous system of vertebrates, Volume 1 |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |isbn=978-3-540-56013-5 |pages=2011–2012 |author=Nieuwenhuys R, Donkelaar HJ, Nicholson C[/tpl]
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain makes it possible to get a measure for the thickness of the human cerebral cortex and relate it to other measures. The thickness of different cortical areas varies but in general, sensory cortex is thinner than motor cortex. One study has found some positive association between the cortical thickness and intelligence.
Another study has found that the somatosensory cortex is thicker in migraine sufferers, though it is not known if this is the result of migraine attacks or the cause of them.[ref]
