==List of feature-length and multi-part episodes==

===Star Trek: The Original Series===

===Star Trek: The Next Generation===

===Star Trek: Deep Space Nine===

Note that the series' serialized structure means that many plot threads and conflicts span multiple episodes, in particular the first six episodes of the sixth season and the series' last nine episodes (referred to collectively as the "Final Chapter").

===Star Trek: Voyager===

===Star Trek: Enterprise===

Note that the series adopted a serialized, arc form during its third and fourth seasons, with all episodes of season 3 (along with one season 2 episode and three season 4 episodes) being considered one long arc called the Xindi Arc. The series' fourth season also consisted primarily of two- and three-episode story arcs, most of which are listed above.
