"Hold It Against Me" is a song by American recording artist Britney Spears, released as the first single from her seventh studio album, Femme Fatale. It was written and produced by Max Martin, Dr. Luke and Billboard, with additional writing by Bonnie McKee. Luke explained that he wanted "Hold It Against Me" to sound unlike his previous productions. The song was originally offered to Katy Perry, but Luke and Martin felt that it did not suit her. A demo version of the track by McKee was leaked on January 6, 2011, and the single became available for streaming on January 10, 2011. It was released the following day.
Musically, "Hold It Against Me" blends pulsating industrial and trance beats with elements of grime. The chorus has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast them with the hard beats. The song features a dubstep-influenced breakdown, in which Spears moans and blows kisses, and the song ends with a final chorus with elements of rave. The lyrics portray the singer seducing someone on the dancefloor, and the chorus revolves around pick-up lines. After the song was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it for being similar to their 1979 hit "If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me". They were sued by Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard for defamation and libel, but the case was dismissed after The Bellamy Brothers apologized. McKee stated in an interview that the title was inspired by a discussion she had with Katy Perry about the latter's body.[tpl]cite news|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|title=Gimme Five: Bonnie McKee's Best Pop Star Stories|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5657568/gimme-five-bonnie-mckees-best-pop-star-stories|accessdate=April 8, 2014|magazine=Billboard (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]Billboard|date=August 15, 2013[/tpl]
Most reviewers praised "Hold It Against Me", although some criticized its lyrical content. The song debuted at number one in Belgium (Wallonia), Canada, Denmark, Finland and New Zealand, as well as on the US Billboard Hot 100, where it became her fourth chart topper. In the United States, "Hold It Against Me" made Spears the second artist in Billboard[tpl]'[/tpl]s history to debut at number one more than once, behind Mariah Carey. "Hold It Against Me" was Spears's second consecutive single to debut at number one. The feat also made her the third female artist to score number one singles in three consecutive decades, and the seventh artist overall. In 2012, it was voted the best song to reach the top position on the Hot 100 over the past two years. The single has also charted in the top five in countries such as Australia, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Finland and Norway.
The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Jonas Åkerlund. It premiered on February 17, 2011, following a two-week promotional campaign of teasers. The video features Spears as a pop star who fell from space to find fame on Earth. There, she becomes overwhelmed by the pressures of being a celebrity and breaks down. The video received mixed to positive reviews; critics complimented its artistic concept and visuals, but dismissed the use of product placement. Spears performed "Hold It Against Me" at Rain Nightclub, Good Morning America and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. She has also performed it as the opening number of the Femme Fatale Tour (2011).

==Composition==

"Hold It Against Me" is three minutes and forty-nine seconds long. It is a dance-pop song that blends pulsating industrial and trance beats with elements of grime.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1345853/Britney-Spears-looking-frightful-releases-new-single-Hold-It-Against-Me.html|title=Dowdy Britney Spears is looking frightful again as she releases new single Hold It Against Me|last=Reporter|first=Daily Mail|date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2011|work=Daily Mail|publisher=Associated Newspapers[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/01/snap-judgment-hold-it-against-me-by-britney-spears.html|title=Snap Judgment: 'Hold It Against Me' by Britney Spears|date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2011|last=Powers|first=Ann|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company[/tpl] Spears' vocals have been described as "a bit treated" but not heavily Auto-Tuned.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5210&Itemid=206|title=So, the new Britney single... |date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2011|publisher=Popjustice|last=Robinson|first=Peter|authorlink= Peter Robinson (journalist)[/tpl] The chorus, reminiscent of other pop productions by Max Martin, has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast them with the hard beats. After the second chorus, the beats drop and Spears speaks the lines in the hook. This is followed by a dubstep-influenced breakdown, which lasts about thirty seconds. Spears moans, blows kisses and sings the lines "Gimme something good, don't wanna wait I want it now / Pop it like a hood and show me how you work it out." "Hold It Against Me" continues with a second breakdown, which is more similar to the sound of the track. The final chorus has a smattering of rave chords and the song has a sudden end.
Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone commented that the song "recalls the synth-gloom ambience of Britney's 2007 gem, Blackout." He also compared the riff to AC/DC's "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" (1976). The hook was noted by Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times to be reminiscent of "(I Just) Died in Your Arms" (1986) by Cutting Crew. Nick Levine of Digital Spy felt the song had a "clubby and au courant" feel, comparable to "Only Girl (In the World)" (2010) by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing Inc., "Hold It Against Me" is set in the compound meter time signature, with a moderate dance beat infused metronome of 133 beats per minute.[tpl]cite web|title=Digital Sheet Music – Britney Spears – Hold It Against Me|last=Gottwald|first=Lukasz|last2=Jomphe-Lepine|first2=Mathieu|last3=McKee|first3=Bonnie|last4=Martin|first4=Max|publisher=Musicnotes.com. Kobalt Music Publishing Inc.|year=2011[/tpl] It is composed in the key of C minor; Spears' vocals range from the key of G3 to G5. The song has a basic sequence of Cm–Fm–Cm–Fm as its chord progression. Lyrically, "Hold It Against Me" talks about seducing someone on the dancefloor. The chorus revolves around pick-up lines; Spears sings, "If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?" and "'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight." James Montgomery of MTV compared the feeling of the lyrics to that of "If U Seek Amy" (2009).[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/01/10/britney-spears-hold-it-against-me-pickup-lines/|title=Britney Spears' 'Hold It Against Me' Inspires Our Inner Pickup Artist|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2011|publisher=MTV Newsroom.

After "Hold It Against Me" was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it for being similar to their 1979 hit "If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me". In a statement, David Bellamy said "professionally, well, in all honesty, we feel completely ripped off.

He also added that Spears did not evolve with the lyrics she sings, and that there was not much growth when compared to singles such as "...Baby One More Time" (1998) or "I'm a Slave 4 U" (2001).[tpl]cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/01/10/britney-spears-hold-it-against-me-leaks/|title=Britney Spears' 'Hold It Against Me' leaks early: What do you think?|last=Wete|first=Brad|date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2011|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Warner[/tpl]
Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented, "It’s one of the tougher-sounding Spears singles yet and should do the job as a dancefloor-filler for listeners who are starting to wear out on the latest singles from Katy Perry and The Black Eyed Peas". However, he also dismissed the lyrical content and said that Spears sounds "bored ... as is the case with most of her recent work."[tpl]cite news|url=http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2011/01/britney-spears-debuts-new-single-hold-it-against-me.html|title=Britney Spears debuts new single, 'Hold it Against Me' |last=Kot|first=Greg|date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2011|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Company[/tpl] Michael Cragg of British newspaper The Guardian called it "decent enough."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/jan/10/britney-spears-hold-it-against-me|title=New music: Britney Spears - Hold It Against Me|last=Cragg|first=Michael|date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2011|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group[/tpl] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone referred to the song as "prime Britney" and stated that it "promises great things for her album."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/hold-it-against-me-20110110|title=Hold it Against Me by Britney Spears|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2011|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner[/tpl] Jim Cantiello of MTV felt the use of pick-up lines was silly, but praised the beat and the vocals, while calling the breakdown "awesome".[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/01/10/britney-spears-hold-it-against-me/|title=Britney Spears Defies Pop Music Rule Book: Don't Hold It Against Her|last=Cantiello|first=Jim|date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2011|publisher=MTV Newsroom.

There was a moment while we were rehearsing where I showed Britney a section and it was something I really wanted her to do, and she freaked out. ... It's crazy when you first see something like that, how overwhelming it can be, especially when you haven't been in the dance studio for a year. ... I think you can expect the unexpected from Britney.

Spears and Åkerlund quickly got together to create the concept, presenting different ideas until, according to Rudolph, "concept took a life on its own".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1658301/britney-spears-femme-fatale.jhtml|title=Britney Spears' Femme Fatale Is Her Ray Of Light, Manager Says|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|last2=Cantiello|first2=Jim|date=February 18, 2011|publisher=MTV News.

On January 22, 2011, Spears tweeted from the video shoot, saying it was "an incredible experience" and would "be one of the best videos I have ever done." On February 2, 2011, accusations came from TMZ.com that Åkerlund had decided to use a dance double for Spears when it seemed like she had not rehearsed her moves enough. Both her representatives and the director denied the rumors, and Åkerlund commenting, "Britney's been great throughout the entire process. ...

They were later added as 'weapons', as Ho explained, "as if they were sharp blades, giving Britney reason to jump and evade around them."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1658426/britney-spears-hold-it-against-me-fight.jhtml|title=Britney Spears Added Her 'Flavor' To 'Hold It Against Me' Fight Scene|date=February 22, 2011|publisher=MTV News.

For the wedding dress scene, B. worked with Tom Tom fashions to create a custom-made dress. Swarovski crystals were used for the "arm creations"; a necklace by Dannijo and gloves by La Cracia were added as accessories. For the fight scene, both Spears and her double wear custom dresses by B., in collaboration with Falguni and Shane Peacock, and also sport stilettos by XTC. During her dance sequence, Spears wears an outfit created by B. and Skin Graft Designs, with jewelry by Tom Binns. The boots were Spears' own, and completely bedazzled with Swarovski crystals. For the microphone sequence, Spears rocks a red look described as "skull shoulders", designed by Yasmen Hussein for Swarovski Runway Rocks. She completes the look with earrings and a necklace by Tom Binns and rings by Loree Rodkin. For the finale scene, Spears wears a custom skintight black dress by Bordelle, complete with garters.

===Synopsis===

The main idea behind the video is the rise, fall, and revival of Spears herself. The video begins when a meteoroid heads for Earth, and lights up a city when it finally lands, symbolizing Spears' entrance to fame and her skyrocketing career in the late 1990s as she became a household name. After this, black-and-white interspersed scenes of Spears getting ready in a soundstage are shown, while the words "Britney Spears" and "Hold It Against Me" appear in Def Leppard-inspired multicolored letters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1657574/britney-spears-hold-it-against-me-teaser.jhtml|title=Britney Spears Hits The Stage In Latest 'Hold It Against Me' Teaser|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=February 9, 2011|publisher=MTV News. MTV Networks|accessdate=September 13, 2011[/tpl] Spears is then seen wearing shorts and showing her midriff in the soundstage, while her dancers in white are getting dressed around her. They are surrounded by cameras and lights, symbolizing her constantly being under the microscope and hounded by the media. As the first chorus begins, Spears appears wearing a white wedding dress inside a cylinder-shaped metal room with wires. The futuristic set and flowing dress are reminiscent of Madonna's music video for "Bedtime Story" (1995).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1658284/britney-spears-hold-it-against-me-references.jhtml|title=Britney Spears' 'Hold It Against Me' Video: A Pop-Culture Cheat Sheet|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=February 18, 2011|publisher=MTV Newsroom. MTV Networks|accessdate=June 22, 2011[/tpl] She is seen rising up the cylinder-shaped metal room and her past music videos surround her, symbolizing her ever growing career in the music industry (and possibly referring to the carousel of Logan's run). When the second verse begins, Spears sings, wearing sparkly red skull-shaped shoulder pads, with microphones around her.
A pastiche of following scenes alternates between Spears dancing on the soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, a reference to the opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the unknown that is to come.

James Montgomery from MTV said that while the video surpassed her most iconic clips in terms of sheer spectacle, it still displayed a level on restraint in its themes. He summarized the review by saying it was one of her all-time best videos, adding that "there's genuine art to it, which makes it both beautiful to look at and powerful."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1658275/britney-spears-hold-it-against-me-video.jhtml|title=Britney Spears' 'Hold It Against Me' Video Premieres|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=February 18, 2011|publisher=MTV News.
