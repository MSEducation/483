The Cross of Valour ([tpl]lang-fr|Croix de la vaillance[/tpl]) is a decoration that is, within the Canadian system of honours, the second highest award (superseded only by the Victoria Cross), the highest honour available for Canadian civilians, and the highest of the three Canadian Bravery Decorations. Created in 1972, the medallion is presented to individuals, both Canadians and foreigners, living and deceased, who have performed acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme peril and grants recipients the ability to use the post-nominal letters CV.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/collections/cmdp/mainmenu/group02/cv| last=Veterans Affairs Canada| title=Modern Honours of Canada (1972) - Cross of Valour (CV)| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=20 November 2011[/tpl]

==History==

The Cross of Valour was conceived of as a replacement for the Order of Canada's Medal of Courage, which had never been awarded since its creation in 1967. On the advice of her Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, the Cross of Valour was initiated on 1 May 1972 by Queen Elizabeth II, and presented for the first time on 20 July of the same year. Prior to 1967, the equivalent medal that Canadians received was the George Cross, of which ten were awarded in Canada: eight military, one merchant navy, and one civilian.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/collections/cmdp/mainmenu/group01/gc| last=Veterans Affairs Canada| title=Orders and Decorations - George Cross (GC)| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=20 November 2011[/tpl]
The Cross of Valour became the centre of a controversy in 2007, when it was announced from the Chancellery of Honours at the Governor General of Canada's residence, Rideau Hall, that deceased Cobourg, Ontario, police constable Chris Garrett would not be awarded the honour. Garett died on duty after an individual lured him with a false 9-1-1 call and then cut his throat; however, Garett, as he was dying, shot and disabled the assailant, thereby preventing other planned attacks.[tpl]cite journal| last=Martin| first=Don| title=Jean seeks shelter from storm| journal=Maclean's| publisher=Rogers Communications| location=Toronto| date=29 November 2007| url=http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/columnists/story.html?id=246f0a43-ad50-41ee-805c-1fd53e2f0a4b&k=15701| issn=0024-9262| accessdate=30 July 2009[/tpl] But, because Garett's nominator waited until the trial for the constable's murderer was concluded, the application arrived at Rideau Hall eight months past the stipulated two-year deadline.[tpl]cite news| title=Petition started to award slain cop Cross of Valour| language=English| publisher=CTV| date=21 November 2007| url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20071121/officer_Valour_071121| accessdate=30 July 2009[/tpl] After a public outcry, the Governor General-in-Council adjusted the rules of application for the Cross of Valour.[tpl]cite journal| title=McGuinty Government Applauds Cross Of Valour Rule Change| journal=Canadian Business Online| publisher=Rogers Communications| date=13 December 2007| url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/markets/cnw/article.jsp?content=20071213_180503_0_cnw_cnw| accessdate=30 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last=O'Meara| first=Jennifer| title=Const.

==Design==

The medal is a cross of four equal limbs rendered in gold, with the obverse enamelled in red and edged with gold, and bearing at the centre a gold maple leaf surrounded by a gold laurel wreath. On the reverse is the Royal Cypher of the reigning Canadian sovereign and a crown above, on the upper arm, while the words VALOUR • VAILLANCE are etched below, extending along the upper edge of the two lateral arms of the cross. The recipient's name and the date of the incident for which they are being honoured are engraved underneath the motto.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.medals.org.uk/canada/canada007.htm| last=Robertson| first=Megan C.| title=C > Canada > Orders, Decorations and Medals of Canada > Cross of Valour| accessdate=4 August 2009[/tpl] This medallion is worn on the left chest, on light crimson ribbon [tpl]convert|38|mm|in[/tpl] wide: for men, hung from a medal bar, and for women, on a ribbon bow pinned to the left chest; a miniature cross may be worn on the ribbon bar in undress. Should an individual already possessing a Cross of Valour be awarded the medal again for subsequent valourous acts, he or she is granted a gold maple leaf to be carried on the same ring from which the original cross is hung; no bars have been issued to date.

==Eligibility==

Anyone may nominate or be nominated for receipt of the Cross of Valour; the incident need not take place in Canada, but Canadian people and/or interests must be involved. The decoration may be awarded posthumously, though nominations must be made no later than two years following either the act of bravery itself or the conclusion of any coroner's or court's inquest into the events for which the person was nominated.
