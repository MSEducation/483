==Organization==

The Organization is headed by the Congress President, who is elected by the All India Congress Committee. The AICC on the other hand is composed of delegates sent by the various State-level Pradesh Congress Committees, who themselves have been elected or nominated to their respective Pradesh Congress Committee from the district and panchayat level party units. Besides the President, these delegates also elect the Congress Working Committee, which is the apex decision making body of the organization. Several General Secretaries are also appointed by the President to run the functioning of the organization.
