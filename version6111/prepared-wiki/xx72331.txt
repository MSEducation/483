</ref> and placed among kings and poets in [[Hero's Corner]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] under a marble monument depicting [[Britannia]] mourning alongside a British lion over André's death. On 2 October 1879, a monument was unveiled on the place of his execution at Tappan until a member of the Order of Socialists in [[New York City]] named Hendrix blew it up three years later.  Hendrix met a violent death in 1884 at the [[Brooklyn]] side of the [[Fulton Ferry (ferry)|Fulton Ferry]].
The names of André's captors were John Paulding, David Williams, and Isaac Van Wart. The United States Congress gave each of them a pension of $200 a year and a silver medal, known as the Fidelity Medallion.  All were honoured in the names of counties in Ohio, and in 1853 a monument was erected to their memory on the place where they captured André. It was re-dedicated in 1880 and is located in Patriot's Park, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.[tpl]NRISref|version=2009a[/tpl]
