[[Kilobyte]]

CATEGORIES: Units of information

The kilobyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. Although the SI prefix kilo- means 1000, the term kilobyte and symbol KB have historically been used to refer to either 1024 (210) bytes or 1000 (103) bytes, dependent upon context, in the fields of computer science and information technology.Kilobyte – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary.

For example, when referring to data transfer ratesConversion of Data Transfer Rate Units and to disk storage space,1977 Disk/Trend Report  Rigid Disk Drives, published June 1977 "kilobyte" means 1000 (103) bytes.  On the other hand, random-access memory capacity such as CPU cache measurements are always stated in multiples of 1024 (210) bytes, due to memory's binary addressing.
In the International System of Quantities, the kilobyte (symbol kB) is 1000 bytes.  The binary representation of 1024 bytes typically uses the symbol KB, using an upper-case K.  Informally sometimes the B is dropped, making K generally understood as 1024 bytes; however, this usage is not standardized and may be found used arbitrarily. All existing recommendations prefer to use the uppercase letter B for byte, because b is used for the bit.

==Definitions==

The unit kilobyte is commonly used to mean either 1000 or 1024 bytes. The value 1024 originated as compromise technical jargon for the byte multiples that needed to be expressed by powers of 2, but lacked a convenient name. As 1024 (210) approximates 1000 (103), roughly corresponding SI multiples were used for binary multiples. In 1998 the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) enacted standards for binary prefixes, specifying the use of kilobyte to strictly denote 1000 bytes and kibibyte to denote 1024 bytes. By 2007, the IEC Standard had been adopted by the IEEE, EU, and NIST and is now part of the International System of Quantities. Nevertheless, the term kilobyte continues to be widely used with both of the following two meanings:

In December 1998, the IEC addressed such multiple usages and definitions by creating unique binary prefixes to denote multiples of 1024, such as “kibibyte (KiB)”, which represents 210, or 1024, bytes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html|title=Prefixes for binary multiples|author=National Institute of Standards and Technology[/tpl] "In December 1998 the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) ... approved as an IEC International Standard names and symbols for prefixes for binary multiples for use in the fields of data processing and data transmission."
