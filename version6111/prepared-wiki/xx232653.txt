From the mid-1980s to early 1990s Duarte and scientists from the [[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command|US
Army Missile Command]] developed ruggedized narrow-linewidth laser oscillators tunable directly in the visible spectrum.F. J. Duarte, J. J. Ehrlich, W. E. Davenport, and T. S. Taylor, Flashlamp-pumped narrow-linewidth dispersive dye laser oscillators: very low amplified spontaneous emission levels and reduction of linewidth instabilities, Appl. Opt. 29, 3176-3179 (1990).[ref]F. J. Duarte, W. E. Davenport, J. J. Ehrlich, and T. S. Taylor,
Ruggedized narrow-linewidth dispersive dye laser oscillator, Opt. Commun. 84, 310-316 (1991).[/ref]  This constituted the first disclosure, in the open literature, of a tunable narrow-linewidth laser tested on a rugged terrain.  This research led to experimentation with polymer gain media and in 1994 Duarte reported on the first narrow-linewidth tunable solid state dye laser oscillators.F. J. Duarte, Solid-state multiple-prism grating dye laser oscillators, Appl. Opt. 33, 3857-3860 (1994).   These dispersive oscillator architectures were then refined to yield single-longitudinal-mode emission limited only by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.F. J. Duarte, Multiple-prism grating solid-state dye laser oscillator: optimized architecture, Appl. Opt. 38, 6347-6349 (1999).

===Organic media===

Joint research, with R. O. James, on solid-state organic-inorganic materials, led to the discovery of polymer-nanoparticle gain media and to the emission of tunable low-divergence homogeneous laser beams from this class of media.F. J. Duarte and R. O. James, Tunable solid-state lasers incorporating dye-doped polymer-nanoparticle gain media, Opt. Lett. 28, 2088-2090 (2003). In 2005, Duarte and colleagues were the first to demonstrate    directional coherent emission from an electrically excited organic semiconductor.F. J. Duarte, L. S. Liao, and K. M. Vaeth, Coherence characteristics of electrically excited tandem organic light-emitting diodes, Opt. Lett. 30, 3072-3074 (2005).F. J. Duarte, Coherent electrically excited organic semiconductors: visibility of interferograms and emission linewidth, Opt. Lett. 32, 412-414 (2007).   These experiments utilized a tandem OLED within an interferometric configuration.

===Tunable lasers for isotope separation===

The tunable narrow-linewidth laser oscillator configurations, introduced by Duarte and Piper,F. J. Duarte and J. A. Piper, Comparison of prism preexpanded and grazing incidence grating cavities for copper laser pumped dye lasers, Appl. Opt. 21, 2782-2786 (1982). were adopted by various research groups working  on uranium atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS).   This work was supported by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. During the course of this research, Duarte writes that he did approach the then federal minister for energy, Sir John Carrick, to advocate for the introduction of an AVLIS facility in Australia.F. J. Duarte, Tunable lasers for atomic vapor laser isotope separation: the Australian contribution, Australian Physics 47(2), 38-40 (2010). In 2002, he participated in research that led to the isotope separation of lithium using narrow-linewidth tunable diode lasers.[ref]I. E. Olivares, A. E. Duarte, E. A. Saravia, F. J. Duarte, Lithium isotope separation with tunable diode lasers, Appl. Opt. 41, 2973-2977 (2002).

===Interferometry and quantum optics===

In the late 1980s, Duarte invented the N-slit laser interferometer and applied Dirac’s notation to describe quantum mechanically its interferometric and propagation characteristics.F. J. Duarte and D. J. Paine, Quantum mechanical description of N-slit interference phenomena, in Proceedings of the International Conference on Lasers '88, R. C. Sze and F. J. Duarte (Eds.) (STS, McLean, Va, 1989) pp. 42-47.F. J. Duarte, in High Power Dye Lasers (Springer-Verlag, Berlin,1991) Chapter 2.F. J. Duarte, On a generalized interference equation and interferometric measurements, Opt. Commun. 103, 8–14 (1993).F. J. Duarte, Electro-optical interferometric microdensitometer system, US Patent 5255069 (1993).  This research  also led to the generalized N-slit interferometric equation that was then applied to describe classical optics phenomena such as interference, diffraction, refraction, and reflection, in a rational and unified quantum approach.F. J. Duarte,  Interference, diffraction, and refraction via Dirac’s notation, Am. J. Phys. 65, 637–640 (1997).F. J. Duarte, Tunable Laser Optics (Elsevier Academic, New York, 2003). Chapter 2.  Duarte also derived the cavity linewidth equation, for dispersive laser oscillators, using quantum mechanical principles.F. J. Duarte, Cavity dispersion equation: a note on its origin, Appl. Opt. 31, 6979-6982 (1992).
More recently, Duarte and colleagues have developed very large N-slit laser interferometers to generate and propagate interferometric characters for secure free-space optical communications.F. J. Duarte, Secure interferometric communications in free space, Opt. Commun. 205, 313-319 (2002).F. J. Duarte, T. S. Taylor, A. M. Black, W. E. Davenport, and P. G. Varmette, N-slit interferometer for secure free-space optical communications: 527 m intra interferometric path length , J. Opt. 13, 035710 (2011).  Interferometric characters is a term coined in 2002 to link interefometric signals to alphanumerical characters (see figure's legend). 
These experiments have also provided the first observation of diffraction patterns superimposed over propagating interference signals, thus demonstrating non-destructive (or soft) interception of propagating interferograms.
A spin-off of this research, with applications to the aviation industry, resulted from the discovery that N-slit laser interferometers are very efficient and effective detectors of clear air turbulence.F. J. Duarte, T. S. Taylor, A. B. Clark, and W. E. Davenport, The N-slit interferometer: an extended configuration, J. Opt. 12, 015705 (2010). 
Duarte provides a description of quantum optics, almost entirely via Dirac's notation, in his book Quantum Optics for Engineers.

==Career==

===Macquarie University===

At Macquarie University (Sydney, Australia), Duarte studied quantum physics under John Clive Ward and semiconductor physics under Ronald Ernest Aitchison.  His PhD research was on laser physics and his supervisor was James A. Piper.F. J. Duarte, Laser Physicist (Optics Journal, New York, 2012).
He also established and led the successful Macquarie science reform movement,F. J. Duarte et al., Science degree, University News 1 (100)  16 (1977).B. Mansfield and M. Hutchinson, Liberality of Opportunity: A history of Macquarie University 1964-1989 (Hale and Iremonger, Sydney, 1992) that transformed the degree structure of the university.  Macquarie's science reform, was widely supported by local scientists including physicists R. E. Aitchison, R. E. B. Makinson, and J. C. Ward.J. C. Ward, Memoirs of a Theoretical Physicist   (Optics Journal, Rochester, 2004).
In 1980, Duarte was elected as one of the Macquarie representatives to the Australian Union of Students from where he was expelled, and then reinstated, for "running over the tables."
Following completion of his PhD work, Duarte did post doctoral research, with B. J. Orr at the University of New South Wales, and then back at Macquarie University.

===American phase===

In 1983, Duarte traveled to the United States to assume a physics professorship at the University of Alabama.  In 1985 he joined the Research Laboratories, at the Eastman Kodak Company, where he remained until 2006.  Further, in 2006, he founded Interferometric Optics.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.opticsjournal.com/introduction.htm | title=Interferometric Optics | publisher=Optics Journal | date=29 August 2010 | accessdate=April 20, 2012[/tpl] Duarte has had a long association with the US Army Missile Command and the US Army Aviation and Missile Command, where he has participated in directed energy research.
He was elected Fellow of the Australian Institute of Physics (1987) and Fellow of the Optical Society of America (1993) for his contributions to the development of narrow-linewidth tunable lasers.  He is the first South American to have received such distinctions.  Subsequently, he received the Engineering Excellence Award from the Optical Society of America for the invention of the N-slit laser interferometer. Duarte's contributions are cited in more than one hundred and fifty scholarly books, including several classics.

===Personal===

Duarte was born in Santiago, Chile, and traveled to Sydney, Australia, as a teenager.  There, he lived first in Strathfield and then in the northern small town of Cowan.  In the  United States he resided for a brief period in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and then moved to Western New York.
