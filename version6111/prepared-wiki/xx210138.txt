Dr Colin Mansfield Campbell (13 August 1872 â€“ 3 April 1907) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL) and a first-class cricketer, representing Tasmania.
A doctor by profession, Campbell appeared for Essendon in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) during the 1890s and was a member of four premiership sides. He came out of retirement in 1897 to play in the inaugural VFL finals series and was part of the team that was awarded the premiership. 
Also in 1897, Campbell represented Tasmania in a first-class cricket match against Victoria at the North Tasmania Cricket Association Ground. He was dismissed in both innings by another debutant in James Giller, for scores of 0 and 17.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4699.html|title=Tasmania v Victoria 1896/97| publisher=CricketArchive[/tpl]
Campbell, who was a rover, continued for Essendon the following season and played in the losing Grand Final that year.
