Indoor soccer, indoor football, arena soccer, or six-a-side football in the United Kingdom, is a game derived from association football adapted for play in an indoor arena such as a turf-covered ice hockey arena or skating rink. The term "indoor soccer" is so well known as a description of the different style of the game that it is even used to describe similar fields which are built outdoors.
Indoor soccer is one of several distinct variants of the game of association football designed for play in indoor arenas. Indoor soccer is most popular in the United States, Canada and Mexico, with several amateur, collegiate and professional leagues functioning. It is also played in Brazil, where it is called showbol. Other variants of indoor football, such as futsal and five-a-side football, are more popular outside North America. These variants have different rules and governing bodies from those of indoor soccer.

==Indoor soccer around the world==

Indoor soccer is primarily played in North America, but is also played elsewhere. There is an international federation dedicated to promoting this sport: the Federacion Internacional de Futbol Rapido (FIFRA)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifra.org/ |title=FederaciÃ³n Internacional de Futbol Rapido:: |publisher=FIFRA |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30[/tpl] based in San Diego, California in the United States. The federation held the first (and so far, only) Indoor Soccer World Championship in 1997 in Mexico, which was won by the host country.[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://futbolweb.mx.tripod.com/ |title=Mundial De Futbol Rápido |publisher=Futbolweb.mx.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30[/tpl] To this day, the FIFRA organizes international tournaments with the participation of several countries. FIFRA has announced the creation of a new Indoor Soccer World Cup tournament, whose first edition will be held in San Diego in 2015.http://oceanside-camppendleton.patch.com/groups/sports/p/san-diego-to-serve-as-host-site-for-first-indoor-soccer-world-cup_ea164cf8

===United States and Canada===

Indoor soccer is a common sport in the United States and especially Canada, with both amateur and professional leagues dedicated to it.  This is because of the short season for outdoor soccer in Canada and the Northern United States, and the ubiquity of arenas built for ice hockey and basketball which can easily be converted to indoor soccer (for the same reasons indoor lacrosse is more popular in Canada, and field  lacrosse in the United States). It is especially popular in Northern Canada due to the often unplayable outdoor conditions and its appearance in the Arctic Winter Games.

===Mexico===

Indoor soccer has also become a popular sport in Mexico, being included as part of the Universiada (University National Games) and the CONADEIP (Private School Tournament), which match University school teams from all over Mexico. In Mexico, indoor soccer fields are most frequently built outdoors (though indoor courts are also used in some tournaments), and the sport is known as fútbol rápido ("fast football"). Some Mexican teams participate in North American collegiate and professional leagues.

===South America===

Indoor soccer is known in Brazil as showbol, with several regional leagues currently functioning. It is a popular hobby in Argentina and Uruguay, where it's called "futbol 5", and it isn't uncommon to see many fields in most cities.

===Europe===

In several European countries, six-a-side variations of indoor soccer are played. Like the version which is common in the American continent, fields are covered with artificial turf and are surrounded by walls, although games with touch lines are also played. In the United Kingdom, Masters Football is the most well-known six-a-side competition. Tournaments among Masters teams (consisting of veteran former players from association football professional teams from each country) are regularly played. In Spain, the sport is known as fútbol indoor to distinguish it from futsal.

====European Minifootball Federation====

There is a European indoor soccer federation known as the European Minifootball Federation (EMF).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurominifootball.com/ |title=EMF - European Minifootball Federation |publisher=Eurominifootball.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30[/tpl] EMF organize the European Minifootball Championship every year and in recent years countries have established official national minifootball associations to help them further organize and develop it. EMF organize variations of six-a-side football and this could come in different shapes and sizes from a large custom-built facility with multiple pitches or even an 11-a-side pitch temporarily split into smaller pitches. This isn't to be confused with the term used in Russia and some other former Soviet countries, where the term mini-football is used to describe futsal.

==Rules==

Rules vary between governing bodies, but some of the nearly universal rule deviations from association football include:
Beyond these common threads, the sport is structured according to the idiosyncrasies of individual leagues.  Most of these rules are adopted from other arena sports like ice hockey.  Below is a listing of some of the more common ones:
