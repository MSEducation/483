==Early life==

John Hoyland was born on 12 October 1934, in Sheffield, Yorkshire, to a working-class family, and educated at Sheffield School of Art and Crafts within the junior art department (1946-51) before progressing to Sheffield School of Art and Crafts proper (1951-56),http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/aug/01/john-hoyland-obituary The Guardian, John Hoyland obituary, Mel Gooding 2011 and the Royal Academy Schools, London (1956-60) where Sir Charles Wheeler, the then President of the Royal Academy famously ordered that Hoyland's paintings – all abstracts – be removed from the walls of the Diploma Galleries. It was only the intervention of Peter Greenham, Acting Keeper of the Schools, that saved the day when he reminded Sir Charles Wheeler that Hoyland also painted landscapes – evidence that he could 'paint properly'.http://johnhoyland.viewtest.co.uk/about/john-hoyland-by-john-mcewen
In 1953 Hoyland went abroad for the first time, hitch-hiking with a friend to the South of France. After the bleakness of Sheffield it was a revelation.http://johnhoyland.viewtest.co.uk/about/john-hoyland-by-john-mcewen

==Career==

The 1960s were a crucial decade for Hoyland; it was in these years that he found his voice as an artist.Lambirth 2009, p. 24. Hoyland's first solo exhibition was held at the Marlborough New London Gallery in 1964 and his first solo museum show at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1967, curated by Bryan Robertson. In the 1960s, Hoyland's work was characterised by simple shapes, high-key colour and a flat picture surface. In the 1970s his paintings became more textured. He exhibited at the Waddington Galleries, London throughout the 1970s and 1980s. During the 1960s and 1970s, he showed his paintings in New York City with the Robert Elkon Gallery and the André Emmerich Gallery. His paintings are closely aligned with Post-Painterly Abstraction, Color Field painting and Lyrical Abstraction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web|title=Colorscope: Abstract Painting 1960-1979|year=2010|publisher=Santa Barbara Museum of Art|accessdate=2 June 2010[/tpl] Hoyland disliked the "abstract" painter label and described himself as "a painter".[tpl]cite news|title=John Hoyland|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/8675980/John-Hoyland.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=1 August 2011[/tpl]
