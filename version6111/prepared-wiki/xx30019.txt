Guarani ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|w|ɑr|ən|iː[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ɡ|w|ær|ə|ˈ|n|iː[/tpl]),Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student’s Handbook, Edinburgh specifically the primary variety known as Paraguayan Guarani (endonym avañe'ẽ [tpl]IPA-gn|aʋãɲẽˈʔẽ|[/tpl] 'Ava language'), is an indigenous language of South America that belongs to the Tupí–Guaraní subfamily of the Tupian languages. It is one of the official languages of Paraguay (along with Spanish), where it is spoken by the majority of the population, and where half of the rural population is monolingual.Mortimer, K 2006 "Guaraní Académico or Jopará?

Guarani is one of the most-widely spoken indigenous language of the Americas and the only one whose speakers include a large proportion of non-indigenous people. This is an anomaly in the Americas where language shift towards European colonial languages (in this case, the other official language of Spanish) has otherwise been a nearly universal cultural and identity marker of mestizos (people of mixed Spanish and Amerindian ancestry), and also of culturally assimilated, upwardly mobile Amerindian people.
Jesuit priest Antonio Ruiz de Montoya, who in 1639 published a book called Tesoro de la lengua guaraní ("The Treasure of the Guaraní Language"), described it as a language "so copious and elegant that it can compete with the most famous languages."
The name "Guarani" is generally used for the official language of Paraguay. However, this is part of a dialect chain, most of whose components are also often called Guarani. See Guarani dialects.

==History==

Guaraní persisted with enough vigor to be made official because the Jesuits elected it as the language to preach Roman Catholicism to the natives (Guaraní was the language of the autonomous Jesuit Reducciones) and because Paraguay's dictators for a time shut the country's borders and thereby protected the local culture and language.

==Writing system==

Guaraní became a written language relatively recently. Its modern alphabet is basically a subset of the Latin script (with "J", "K" and "Y" but not "W"), complemented with two diacritics and six digraphs. Its orthography is largely phonemic, with letter values mostly similar to those of Spanish. The tilde is used with many letters that are considered part of the alphabet. In the case of Ñ/ñ, it differentiates the palatal nasal from the alveolar nasal (as in Spanish), whereas it marks stressed nasalisation when used over a vowel (as in Portuguese): ã, ẽ, ĩ, õ, ũ, ỹ. (Nasal vowels have been written with several other diacritics: ä, ā, â, ã.) The tilde also marks nasality in the case of G̃/g̃, used to represent the nasalized velar approximant by combining the velar approximant "G" with the nasalising tilde. The letter G̃/g̃, which is unique to this language, was introduced into the orthography relatively recently during the mid-20th century and there is disagreement over its use. It is not a precomposed character in Unicode, which can cause typographic inconveniences - such as needing to press "delete" twice - or imperfect rendering when using computers and fonts that do not properly support the complex layout feature of glyph composition.
Only stressed nasal vowels are written as nasal. If an oral vowel is stressed, and it is not the final syllable, it is marked with an acute accent: á, é, í, ó, ú, ý. That is, stress falls on the vowel marked as nasalized, if any, else on the accent-marked syllable, and if neither appears, then on the final syllable.

==Phonology==

Guaraní only allows syllables consisting of a consonant plus a vowel or a vowel alone; syllables ending in a consonant or two or more consonants together are not possible. This is represented (C)V.
Consonants:
IPA value is shown.  The orthography is shown in angle brackets below, if different.
The voiced consonants have oral allophones (left) before oral vowels, and nasal allophones (right) before nasal vowels. The oral allophones of the voiced stops are prenasalized.
There is also a sequence /n[tpl]IPA|t/[/tpl] (written «nt»). A trill [tpl]IPA|/r/[/tpl] (written «rr») and the consonants [tpl]IPA|/l/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/f/[/tpl], and [tpl]IPA|/j/[/tpl] (written «ll») are not native to Guarani, but come from Spanish.
Oral [tpl]IPA|ᵈj[/tpl] is often pronounced [tpl]IPA|dʒ, ʒ, j[/tpl], depending on the dialect, but the nasal allophone is always [tpl]IPA|ɲ[/tpl].
The dorsal fricative is in free variation between [tpl]IPA|x[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|h[/tpl].
«g», «gu» are approximants, not fricatives, but are sometimes transcribed [tpl]IPA|ɣ, ɣʷ[/tpl], as is conventional for Spanish. «gu» is also transcribed [tpl]IPA|ɰʷ[/tpl], which is essentially identical to [tpl]IPA|w[/tpl].
All syllables are open, viz. CV or V, ending in a vowel.

===Glottal stop===

The glottal stop is only written between vowels, but occurs phonetically before vowel-initial words. Because of this, Ayala (2000:19) shows that some words have several glottal stops near each other, which consequently undergo a number different dissimilation techniques. For example "I drink water" 'a'y'u is pronounced hay'u. This suggests that even irregular verbs in Guarani are regular underlyingly. There also seems to be some degree of variation between how much the glottal stop is dropped (for example aru'uka > aruuka > aruka for "I bring"). It is suspected that the glottal stop was not an original phoneme but that word-internal glottal stops are only fossilized compounds where the second component was a vowel-initial (and therefore glottal stop–initial) root.Ayala, Valentín (2000).

===Nasal harmony===

Guaraní displays an unusual degree of nasal harmony. A nasal syllable consists of a nasal vowel, and if the consonant is voiced, it takes its nasal allophone. If a stressed syllable is nasal, the nasality spreads in both directions until it bumps up against a stressed syllable that is oral. This includes affixes, postpositions, and compounding. Voiceless consonants do not have nasal allophones, but they do not interrupt the spread of nasality.
For example,
However, a second stressed syllable, with an oral vowel, will not become nasalized: 
That is, for a word with a single stressed vowel, all voiced segments will be either oral or nasal, while voiceless consonants are unaffected, as in oral /m[tpl]IPA|botɨ/[/tpl] vs nasal [tpl]IPA|/mõtɨ̃/[/tpl].

==Grammar==

Guaraní is a highly agglutinative language, often classified as polysynthetic. It is a fluid-S type active language and it has been classified as a 6th class language in Milewski's typology. It uses subject–verb–object word order usually, but object–verb when the subject is not specified.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]
The language lacks gender and has no definite article, but due to influence from Spanish, la is used as a definite article for singular reference, and lo  for plural reference. These are not found in pure Guaraní (Guaraniete).

===Nouns===

Guaraní exhibits nominal tense: past, expressed with -kue, and future, expressed with -rã. For example, tetã ruvichakue translates to "ex-president" while tetã ruvicharã translates to "president-elect." The past morpheme -kue is often translated as “ex-,” “former,” “abandoned,” “what was once,” or “one-time." These morphemes can even be combined to express the idea of something that was going to be but didn't end up happening. So for example, pa'irãgue is "a person who studied to be a priest but didn't actually finish," or rather, "the ex-future priest." Note that some nouns use -re instead of -kue and others use -guã instead of -rã.[tpl]cite book|last=Guasch|first=P.

===Pronouns===

Guaraní distinguishes between inclusive and exclusive pronouns of the first person plural.
Reflexive pronoun: je: ahecha ("I look"), ajehecha ("I look at myself")

===Conjugation===

Guaraní stems can be divided into a number of conjugation classes, which are called areal (with the subclass aireal) and chendal, respectively. The names for these classes stem from the names of the prefixes for 1st and 2nd person singular.
The areal conjugation is used to convey that the participant is actively involved, whereas the chendal conjugation is used to convey that the participant is the undergoer. Note that transitive verbs can take either conjugation, intransitive verbs normally take areal, but can take chendal for habitual readings. Nouns can also be conjugated, but only as chendal. This conveys a predicative possessive reading.Caralho, Jao de(1993) Peixes de Ámérica do Sul, Universidade de Rio de Janeiro
Furthermore, the conjugations vary slightly according to the stem being oral or nasal.
Verb root ñe'ẽ ("speak"); nasal verb.

====Negation====

Negation is indicated by a circumfix n(d)(V)-...-(r)i in Guaraní. The preverbal portion of the circumfix is nd- for oral bases and n- for nasal bases. For 2nd person singular, an epenthetic e is inserted before the base, for 1st person plural inclusive, an epenthetic a is inserted.
The postverbal portion is -ri for bases ending in -i, and -i for all others
The negation can be used in all tenses, but for future or irrealis reference, the normal tense marking is replaced by mo'ã, resulting in n(d)(V)-base-mo'ã-i as in Ndajapomo'ãi, "I won't do it".
There are also other negatives, such as: ani, ỹhỹ, nahániri, naumbre, naanga.

===Tense and aspect morphemes===

The verb form without suffixes at all is a present somewhat aorist: Upe ára resẽ reho mombyry, "that day you got out and you went far"
These two suffixes can be added together: ahátama, "I'm already going"
This suffix can be joined with ma, making up páma: ñande jaikuaapáma nde remimo'ã, "now we became to know all your thought". 
These are unstressed suffixes: ta, ma, ne, vo, "mi"; so the stress goes upon the last syllable of the verb or the last stressed syllable.

==Determiners==

==Spanish loans in Guaraní==

The close and prolonged contact Spanish and Guaraní have experienced has resulted in many Guaraní words of Spanish origin. Many of these loans were for things or concepts unknown to the New World prior to Spanish colonization. Examples are seen below:  Pinta, J. (2013). "Lexical strata in loanword phonology: Spanish loans in Guaraní". Master's thesis, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

==Guaraní loans in English==

English has adopted a small number of words from Guaraní (or perhaps the related Tupi) via Portuguese, mostly the names of animals. "Jaguar" comes from jaguarete and "piranha" comes from pira aña. Other words are: "agouti" from akuti, "tapir" from tapira and "açaí" from ïwasa'i. 
The name of Paraguay is itself a Guaraní word, as is the name of Uruguay. However, the exact meaning of either placename is up to varied interpretations. (See: List of country-name etymologies)
