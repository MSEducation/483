==History==

Charlotte RFC formed in 1971 by former college rugby players living in the Charlotte area.  In 1974, some of the players decided to leave and form a separate club, the Charlotte Gargoyles.  The succession prompted Charlotte RFC to adopt the nickname "Olde Originals" to distinguish themselves from the other Charlotte team.Official Olde Originals History Charlotte joined the Rugby Super League in 2006; in 2010 they announced they would not compete in the 2011 Super League season.[tpl]cite news |title= Charlotte the latest to quit RSL|author= Danny Stephens|url= http://www.americanrugbynews.com/artman/publish/super_league/Charlotte_the_latest_to_quit_RSL.shtml|newspaper= americanrugbynews.com|date= Nov 22, 2010 |accessdate=January 14, 2011[/tpl]
