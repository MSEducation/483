Mutawintji  (previous name: Mootwingee) is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, 878 km west of Sydney and about 130 km north-east of Broken Hill.
The rugged, mulga-clad Byngnano Range is dissected by colourful gorges, rockpools and creek beds lined with red gums. Scattered among the caves and overhangs are Aboriginal rock art and engravings.
In 1979, the Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife purchased and fenced 100 km², in the Coturaundee Ranges, now part of Mutawintji National Park, for the conservation and protection of the Yellow-footed Rock Wallaby.
Follow-up funding of fox eradication in the reserve ensured the survival of this last population of Yellow-footed Rock-wallabies in NSW.
The park also protects Mutawintji Historic Site, containing one of the best collections of Australian Aboriginal Rock Art.
