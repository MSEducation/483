[[List of photovoltaics companies]]

CATEGORIES: Solar energy companies, Lists of companies by industry, Lists related to renewable energy, Photovoltaics manufacturers

This is a list of notable photovoltaics (PV) companies. 
Grid-connected solar photovoltaics (PV) is the fastest growing energy technology in the world, with 50% annual increases in cumulative installed capacity in 2006 and 2007, to an estimated 7.7 GW. This translates into 1.5 million homes with rooftop photovoltaics feeding into the electricity grid worldwide.REN21 (2008). Renewables 2007 Global Status Report (PDF) p. 6. During 2007, investment in new solar photovoltaic manufacturing facilities was strong in Europe, Japan, China, Taiwan and the United States, with many new operations reported.REN21 (2008). Renewables 2007 Global Status Report (PDF) p. 19. Since October 2009, the Canadian province of Ontario has had vast success with the implementation of their feed-in tariff incentive for grid-connected solar systems. Ontario is currently leading the way in North America with this comprehensive renewable energy incentive.http://fit.powerauthority.on.ca/Storage/100/10898_FIT_-_CAE_Event_News_Release_-_FINAL.pdf Ontario Power Authority FIT success press release, March 10, 2010
Photovoltaics companies include PV capital equipment producers, cell manufacturers, panel manufacturers and installers. The list does not include silicon manufacturing companies.

===Top ten===

Yearly Ranking
Top 10 solar module players in the world
Solar modules, as the final products to be installed to generate electricity, are regarded as the major components to be selected by customers willing to choose solar PV energy. Solar module manufacturers must be sure that their products can be substainable for application periods of more than 25 years. As a result, major solar module players have their products be proved by publically recognized testing organizations and guarantee their durable efficiency rate for a certain period of years. The solar PV market has been growing for the past few years. According to solar PV research company, PVinsights, worldwide shipment of solar modules in 2011 was around 25 GW, and the shipment year over year growth was around 40%. The top 5 solar module players in 2011 in turns are Suntech, First Solar, Yingli, Trina, and Canadian. The top 5 solar module companies possessed 51.3% market share of solar modules, according to PVinsights' market intelligence report. 
Top 10 solar cell players
According to an annual market survey by the photovoltaics trade publication Photon International, global production of photovoltaic cells and modules in 2009 was 12.3 GW. The top ten manufacturers accounted for 45% of this total.Hirshman, W. P., "Surprise, surprise (cell production 2009: survey)," Photon International, (March 2010), pp. 176-199. 
In 2010, a tremendous growth of solar PV cell shipments doubled the solar PV cell market size. According to the solar PV market research company,PVinsights, Suntech topped the ranking of solar cell production. Most of the top ten solar PV producers doubled their shipment in 2010 and five of them were over one gigawatt shipments.The top ten solar cell producers dominated the market with an even higher market share, say 50~60%, with respect to an assumed twenty gigawatt cell shipments in 2010 
Note: 2009 shipments of Motech and Canadian Solar are by PVinsights.
Quarterly ranking 
Although yearly ranking is as listed above, quarterly ranking can indicate that which company can sustain particular conditions such as sever price adjustment, Government Feed-in Tariff change, Weather conditions and etc. In 2Q11, First solar regained Championship of solar module shipment from Suntech.From the 2Q11 results, four phenomena should be noticed. (1) Thin Film leader First Solar still dominates (2) More Centralized in solar module market (3) Chinese companies soared (4) Giga-Watt game is prevailing. (According to Latest Solar Model Shipment report by PVinsigts)http://pvinsights.com/Report/ReportPMM31A.php
Thin-film ranking
Thin films represented 16.8% of total global production, up from 12.5% in 2008. The top ten thin-film producers were:

2 Plant closed in 2009.BP Solar closes its Spanish factories

3 Production greater than capacity due to closing of some production lines in mid-year.

4 Filed for bankruptcy on Aug 15, 2011Evergreen Solar Seeks Bankruptcy
According to EnergyTrend, the 2011 Global Top Ten Polysilicon, Solar Cell and Solar Module Manufacturers by capacity are found in countries including People's Republic of China, United States, Taiwan, Germany, Japan, and Korea.
In 2011, the global top ten polysilicon makers by capacity are as follows, GCL, Hemlock, OCI, Wacker, LDK, REC, MEMC, Tokuyama, LCY and Woongjin, represented by People's Republic of China, United States, Taiwan, Germany, Japan and South Korea.

===2011 global top ten polysilicon manufacturers by capacity===

On the other hand, the 2011 global top ten solar cell makers by capacity are dominated by both Chinese and Taiwanese companies, including Suntech, JA Solar, Trina, Yingli, Motech, Gintech, Canadian Solar, NeoSolarPower, Hanwha Solar One and JinkoSolar.

===2011 global top ten solar cell manufacturer by capacity===

In terms of solar module by capacity, the 2011 Global Top Ten are: Suntech, LDK, Canadian Solar, Trina, Yingli, Hanwha Solar One, Solar World, Jinko Solar, Sunneeg and Sunpower, represented by makers in People's Republic of China and Germany.

===2011 global top ten solar module by capacity===

In terms of wafer and cell capacities, both makers from Taiwan and China have demonstrated significant year over year growth from 2010 to 2011.

===China and Taiwan production capacity===

==Solar photovoltaic production by country==

China now manufactures almost half of the world’s solar photovoltaics (China and Taiwan together share 60% of the world market). China’s production has been rapidly escalating – in 2001 it had less than 1% of the world market.
