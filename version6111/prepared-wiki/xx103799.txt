==History==

KXNT originally signed on the air in 1986 with the call letters KVEG, and a talk/sports format. 
KVEG had a wide variety of drive-time talent including Sam Greenfield, Dominick Brascia, Lou Epton, Irwin Schiff and the syndicated Tom Leykis. In 1997, KVEG changed its calls to KXNT. Management was looking to head the station in a new direction. KXNT AM 840 would begin airing syndicating programs like Rush Limbaugh and Coast to Coast AM previously heard on rival station KDWN. Others included Dr. Laura and Bill Handel.

==Shows==

Currently, mornings include The Wall Street Journal Report (5-6 AM) followed by Las Vegas' Morning News, with host Joe Gillespe and news anchor/sidekick Kristen Flowers. Corey Olson reports from the field, with reporters Mark Thomas and Brian Shaprio, and afternoon news anchor Robert Rytina also contributing. 
Alan Stock joined KXNT in 1999, initially hosting afternoon drive, moving to mornings with Co-host Heidi Harris from 2001â€“2006, until Harris moved to KDWN. She was replaced by Kerri Kasem, who returned to Los Angeles in 2008. He continued to solo host the "KXNT Morning Source" until May 2010, when he was moved back to afternoons. The Alan Stock Afternoon News Show ended its run in July 2011. Kevin Wall became the permanent host for the "Live and Local" block (3-6 PM) in November 2011.
The KXNT lineup also includes syndicated Rush Limbaugh (9am-Noon), Sean Hannity (Noon-3 PM), Dave Ramsey (6-9 PM), and Mark Levin (9-12 midnight), and Coast to Coast AM (12AM-5AM).

==Simulcast==

Sister station KXNT-FM was born in 2010 and currently simulcasts the programming of the AM station, providing listeners two options to receive it. This is being done in a number of markets, such as Salt Lake City and Phoenix, with FM simulcasting beginning on the higher rated AM stations.
