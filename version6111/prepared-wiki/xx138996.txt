Luton Bute Street railway station was the first to be built in Luton. It was opened by the Luton, Dunstable and Welwyn Junction Railway Company in 1858, which was an extension of the Welwyn and Hertford Railway. The track to Welwyn was completed in 1860 and taken over by the Great Northern the following year. 
It was valuable to Luton people not only for passengers but also for facilitating the London market for the town's trade in plaited straw goods. The station, and the line to Welwyn, closed in 1965.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books
Following closure to passengers in 1965, the station buildings were quickly demolished despite the line remaining open for freight until 1989/1990. The site of the station was later used as a car park for Luton railway station. Throughout the years, various local pressure groups have been supportive of reopening the station as part of a viable branch line between Dunstable and Luton. In the mid-1990s, there was a debate about reopening it with either the operation of Diesel Class 158's or electric Class 319's.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
The site is currently undertaking extensive redevelopment as the new Luton Gateway transport interchange as work progresses on the building of the Luton Dunstable guided busway scheme.
