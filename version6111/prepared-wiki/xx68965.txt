Richard Andrew 'Andy' Robinson OBE (born 3 April 1964) is an English rugby union coach and retired player. He is the current Director of Rugby at Bristol Rugby. He is the former head coach of Scotland.
Robinson played as an openside flanker for Bath, England and the British and Irish Lions. He was head coach of England from October 2004 until November 2006, then coach of Edinburgh Rugby and joint coach of Scotland A between October 2007 and June 2009. On 4 June 2009 Robinson was named the new head coach of Scotland. He resigned on 25 November 2012 following a 21–15 defeat at home against Tonga.

==Playing career==

Born in Taunton, Somerset, Robinson made his England debut against Australia on 12 June 1988, and gained eight caps, playing his last match on 18 November 1995 against South Africa. Robinson was quite small for a back row forward, being only 5 ft 9in (1.75 m), and weighing 13 st 12 lb (88 kg). He played 6 non-international games for the British and Irish Lions on their 1989 tour of Australia.

==Teaching==

Whilst playing for Bath, Robinson taught mathematics, physical education and rugby at Writhlington School, King Edward's School, Bath and later Colston's Collegiate School in Bristol, where he and Alan Martinovic masterminded the school's Daily Mail Cup wins in 1995 and 1996. 'Robbo' then left to play rugby professionally with Bath.

==Coaching==

Robinson later coached Bath before being appointed forwards coach of England and was deputy to Clive Woodward with the World Cup-winning England side in 2003. When Woodward resigned from the role of England coach in September 2004, Robinson was named as acting coach before being confirmed in the position. He was also a coach on the Lions tours to Australia in 2001 and New Zealand in 2005.
Robinson won just nine of his twenty two matches in charge of England. In November 2006, it was confirmed that Robinson would remain Head Coach with the position reviewed after the two tests against South Africa. Defeat in the second test[tpl]cite web|last=Standley |first=James |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/6177734.stm |title=England 14–25 South Africa |publisher=BBC News |date=25 November 2006 |accessdate=8 June 2013[/tpl] increased demands from supporters that he should be replaced. On 29 November his resignation as head coach was announced, with Robinson blaming his lack of support from the RFU.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/english/6185090.stm |title=Robinson is forced out by England |publisher=BBC News |date=29 November 2006 |accessdate=8 June 2013[/tpl]
In the summer of 2007, the Scottish Rugby Union appointed Robinson the new head coach of Edinburgh Rugby, as well as joint coach of Scotland A with Glasgow coach Sean Lineen. In his first season as coach, he guided Edinburgh to the highest ever finish by a Scottish side in the Magners League (joint 3rd), despite numerous international players leaving the previous summer for more lucrative contracts in England and France. The following season (2008–09) Edinburgh leap-frogged Leinster and the Ospreys on the final day of the competition to finish runners-up behind Munster. Edinburgh also finished highest points scorers. He stepped down in June 2009 to take up the role of head coach of Scotland, replacing Frank Hadden. That stint ended after a string of disappointing results, culminating in defeat by Tonga on 24 November 2012 which was followed a day later by his resignation.
On 18 February 2013 it was announced by Bristol Rugby club that Andy Robinson was joining the club as the new director of rugby.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/21496687 |title=BBC Sport – Andy Robinson: Bristol name ex-Scotland boss as director of rugby |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=18 February 2013 |accessdate=8 June 2013[/tpl]
