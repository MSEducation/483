Kent Brockman is a fictional character in the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by Harry Shearer and first appeared in the episode "Krusty Gets Busted". He is a grumpy, self-centered local Springfield news anchor.

==Profile==

Kent Brockman hosts the Channel 6 weekday news, as well as Smartline, a local current-affairs program (a parody of the national current-affairs program Nightline), Bite Back! With Kent Brockman (a parody on "Fight Back! With David Horowitz), Eye on Springfield (a parody of Eye on LA), which focuses mostly on Springfield's entertainment news, the game show Springfield Squares,  and has his own personal commentary segment of the Springfield News, "My Two Cents".
As seen in a flashback to the 1960s in the episode "Mother Simpson", Brockman was known as Kenny Brockelstein early in his career. Brockman has a daughter, Brittany, who may or may not have been the product of his fling with the Channel 6 weather girl.
In "Dog of Death", Brockman won the multi-million-dollar ($130 million) state lottery jackpot and left the news desk while still on the air. However, he remained a news anchor because he was under contract, though he also admitted that he likes making $500,000 a year. He has an ongoing feud with traffic reporter Arnie Pye, and has been shown to criticize Pye's reporting and also even chuckles when it was thought Pye had died in a helicopter accident.
It has been hinted that Brockman is ethnically Jewish, having changed his surname from Brockelstein. He can sometimes be spotted wearing the Hebrew Chai symbol on a necklace. He is seen several times attending Reverend Lovejoy's Protestant church,http://www.jewornotjew.com/profile.jsp?ID=186 and in "Marge on the Lam" he states his belief in the Book of Revelation,http://www.snpp.com/episodes/1F03.html suggesting he professes Christian religious beliefs.
Brockman's penchant for using offensive language works against him in the 400th episode, "You Kent Always Say What You Want", where, after Homer accidentally spills coffee on Brockman's crotch, he shouts, what Ned Flanders calls, a "super swear" that shocked everyone who watched it. Brockman was demoted to weather man due to the station paying a fine to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and was soon fired when the network executives deliberately mistook a ring of Splenda in Brockman's coffee for cocaine. Brockman was later given his job back to silence him (after doing an expose that was seen on YouTube uncovering the real reason the FCC is cracking down on obscenity in the media), with a 50% raise, making his new salary $750,000 a year.

Brockman is responsible for introducing the snowclone "I, for one, welcome our new fill-in-the-blank overlords", sometimes used to express mock submission, usually for the purpose of humor.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|pp=293-294[/tpl] The term has been used in the media, such as New Scientist magazine,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/blog/space/2007/06/british-government-welcomes-our-new.html|title=The British government welcomes our new insect overlords|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=2008-12-30|date=June 5, 2007[/tpl] the Houston Chronicle [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/End-food-truck-wars-4264461.php|title=End food truck wars|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=2013-02-11|date=February 10, 2013[/tpl] and Ken Jennings on Jeopardy!: The Watson Challenge (versus Watson).[tpl]cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/02/watson-jeopardy-finale-man-vs-machine-showdown.html|title=Watson wins 'Jeopardy!' finale; Ken Jennings welcomes 'our new computer overlords'|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2011-02-16|accessdate=2011-02-17|author=Melissa Maerz[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Ben |title=Is It Time to Welcome Our New Computer Overlords? |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/02/is-it-time-to-welcome-our-new-computer-overlords/71388/ |accessdate=April 28, 2012 |newspaper=The Atlantic |date=February 17, 2011[/tpl] Brockman's harangue about the Corvair spacecraft being taken over by a master race of giant space ants in "Deep Space Homer", which generated the meme, is considered to be one of the show's classic moments. The spacecraft was carrying an ant colony to see if they could be trained to sort tiny screws in space, but were released by Homer by accident. This led to an ant drifting by the video feed, appearing gigantic due to its proximity to the camera, at which point Brockman contemplates if the "master race of giant space ants ... will consume the captive earth men or merely enslave them" and eventually utters the line "And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords".  Author Chris Turner called it "perhaps his finest hour as a journalist"[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=403[/tpl] and said that it is "simply among the finest comedic moments in the history of television."[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=69[/tpl]
