==History==

===Aboriginals===

For tens of thousands of years, Canada was inhabited by Aboriginal peoples from a variety of different cultures and of several major linguistic groupings.  Each of the aboriginal communities had (and have) their own unique musical traditions. Chanting - singing is widely popular and most use a variety of musical instruments.[tpl]cite book|author1=Elaine Keillor|author2=Tim Archambault|author3=John M. H.

===17th century===

French settlers and explorers to New France brought with them a great love of song, dance and fiddle playing. Beginning in the 1630s French and Aboriginal  children at Quebec City were taught to sing and play European instruments, like viols, violins, guitars, transverse flutes, drums, fifes and trumpets.  Ecole des Ursulines  and The Ursuline Convent are among North America's oldest schools and  the first institutions of learning for women in North America.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.museocapitale.qc.ca/014a.htm |title=The Ursulines in New-France |work=Musée des Ursulines de Québec|accessdate=2009-10-28 [/tpl] both were founded in 1639 by French nun Marie of the Incarnation (1599–1672) alongside the laywoman Marie-Madeline de Chauvigny de la Peltrie (1603–1671) and are the  first Canadian  institutions to have music as part of the curriculum.New Catholic encyclopedia. editors, Thomas Carson, Joann Cerrito - Washington, D.C.

A French-born priest, René Ménard, composed motets around 1640, and a second Canadian-born priest, Charles-Amador Martin, is credited with the plainchant music for the  Sacrae familiae felix spectaculum, in celebration of the Holy Family feast day in 1700.

===18th century===

Historically,  music was  composed in  Canada's colonies and settlements  during the 18th century, although very few popular named works have survived or were even published. The French and Indian Wars began and left the population economically drained and ill-equipped to develop cultural pursuits properly. The part-time composers of this period were nonetheless often quite skilled. Traditional songs and dances, such as those of the Habitants and Métis, were transmitted orally, from generation to generation and from village to village, thus  people felt no need to transcribe or publish them.Contemporary Canadian Composers. ed. by Keith MacMillan and John Beckwith.

After the 1760s, regular concerts became a part of the cultural landscape, as well as a wide variety of dancing. Operatic excerpts began to appear, and before the end of the century Canada had its first home-grown grand opera.
