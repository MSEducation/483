Corn soup is a soup traditionally made of corn (typically sweetcorn) It was normally made in corn-producing areas of the world, but is now widespread because of greater corn distribution. The basic recipe is some type of soup base with corn added followed by whatever ingredients give it its distinct style. Typically ingredients are corn cut from the cob, water, butter, some flour, an egg, with salt and pepper for seasoning — this varies by region.

Corn, being a staple crop for many Native American tribes has led to corn soup being a primary food among them.  M. R. Harrington reported that 1908 hulled-corn soup onno'kwǎ' was the most popular dish for the Seneca Indians. He also stated, "seldom do the Indians, pagan or Christian, meet for any function ... without a kettle of onno'kwǎ', hot and savory, to regale the crowd". The soup was served at religious events, the people getting a ladleful every time they encircled the kettle.M. R. Harrington. Some Seneca Corn-Foods and Their Preparation.
