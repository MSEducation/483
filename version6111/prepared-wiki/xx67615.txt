==Life and career==

===Early life===

Alex Higgins was born in Belfast and had three sisters. He started playing snooker at the age of 11, often in the Jampot club in his native Sandy Row area of south Belfast and later in the YMCA in the nearby city centre. At age 14 and weighing seven and a half stones (47.6 kg), he left for England and a career as a jockey. However, he never made the grade because, in his youth, he drank a lot of Guinness and ate a lot of chocolate which made him too heavy to ride competitively. He returned to Belfast and by 1965, aged 16, he had compiled his first maximum break. In 1968 he won the All-Ireland and Northern Ireland Amateur Snooker Championships.

===World titles===

Higgins turned professional at the age of 22, winning the World Championship at his first attempt in 1972, against John Spencer winning 37–32. Higgins was then the youngest ever winner of the title, a record retained until Stephen Hendry's 1990 victory at the age of 21.[tpl]cite news | title = 1990 – Cue Stephen Hendry | date = 2002-04-12 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/world_champs_2002/1921463.stm | work = BBC Sport | accessdate = 2010-09-24[/tpl] In April 1976, Higgins reached the final again and faced Ray Reardon. Higgins led 11–9, but Reardon made four centuries and seven breaks over 60 to pull away and win the title for the fifth time with the score of 27–16. Higgins was also the runner-up to Cliff Thorburn in 1980, losing 18–16, after being 9–5 up. Higgins won the world title for a second time in 1982 after beating Reardon 18–15 (with a 135 total clearance in the final frame); it was an emotional as well as professional victory for him. Higgins would have been ranked #1 in the world rankings for the 1982/83 season had he not forfeited ranking points following disciplinary action.[tpl]cite news |last1=Osley |first1=Richard |last2=Gray |first2=Sadie |title=Snooker legend Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins is dead |publisher=The Independent |date= 25 July 2010 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/snooker-legend-alex-hurricane-higgins-is-dead-2034992.html |accessdate=1 December 2010 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news |work=The Belfast Telegraph |title=Alex Higgins: The genius |publisher=Independent News & Media |date= 26 July 2010 |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/alex-higgins/alex-higgins-the-genius-14888599.html |accessdate=1 December 2010[/tpl]

===Other victories===

Throughout his career, Higgins won 20 other titles, one of the most notable being the 1983 UK Championship. In the final he trailed Steve Davis 0–7 before producing a famous comeback to win 16–15.[ref]
