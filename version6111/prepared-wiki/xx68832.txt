Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport [tpl]Airport codes|YTZ|CYTZ[/tpl], commonly known as the Toronto Island Airport, is a small airport located on the Toronto Islands in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is named after Air Marshal Billy Bishop, a Canadian World War I flying ace. The airport is used by civil aviation, air ambulances, and regional airlines using turboprop planes. It is accessed by passenger ferry. In 2011, it was ranked Canada's 9th-busiest airport and Ontario's third-busiest airport by passenger numbers and the 14th-busiest Canadian airport in terms of aircraft movements.torontoport.com – About Us The airport was previously known as Toronto City Centre Airport and Port George VI Island Airport.
Conceived in the 1930s as the main airport for Toronto, the construction of the airport was completed in 1939 by the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC). At the same time, the THC built Malton Airport as an alternate, but Malton became Toronto's main passenger airline hub instead, leaving the island airport for general aviation and military purposes. During the 1940s and 1950s, several political leaders proposed expansion of the island airport to enable scheduled passenger airlines and reduce the annual operating costs. Malton was sold in 1962 to the Government of Canada in exchange for an expansion and improvements to the island airport. After the expansion, civil flights increased to a peak of over 200,000 annual flights in the 1960s. Although regional airlines were introduced in the 1970s, the annual number of flights went into decline and closure was discussed. In 1983, a 50-year tripartite agreement between the governments of Canada, Toronto and the Harbour Commission, which limited noise and banned jet use for scheduled airlines, allowed airport operations to continue. In the 1990s, in an era of government cost-cutting, questions about the airport's future were raised again due to its annual deficit. At the same time, redevelopment was taking over north of the airport and several studies suggested that the airport was incompatible with development.
In 1999, the new Toronto Port Authority (TPA) replaced the THC. The TPA's mandate was to make the Port and Airport self-sufficient and it determined that the airport needed to expand to end the annual subsidy. Although expansion of the airport was and is politically controversial, the TPA has worked with new regional airline Porter Airlines since 2003 to increase scheduled carrier flights. Under the new financial model, carriers pay landing fees and departing passengers pay airport improvement fees to the TPA. Porter launched in 2006 and passenger volumes increased to the point that airport operations became self-sufficient by 2010. In 2011, Porter opened a new terminal. In 2012, the TPA began constructing a pedestrian tunnel to the airport, after a previous plan to build a bridge was cancelled. In 2013, Porter has proposed extending the airport runways and modifying the operating agreement to allow it to use Bombardier CS100 jets at the airport. The proposal is under study.

==History==

===1930s–1940s===

The first proposal to build an airport was made in June 1929 by the Toronto Harbour Commission. The Commission proposed a four-stage plan, starting with an "air harbour" for seaplanes, while the final stages proposed filling the then-regatta course lagoon between the sandbar and Hanlan's Point.[tpl]sfn|Gibson|1984|p=177[/tpl] Toronto City Council at that time agreed to the "air harbour" but "in no way-either by implication or suggestion- implies approval of the ultimate development of a combined air harbour and airport."Toronto City Council minutes of June 19, 1929, as quoted in Gibson, p. 177 In August 1935, Council reversed its position and approved the airport project by a vote of 15–7, against the opposition of Toronto mayor Sam McBride (who was serving as a Councillor at the time).[tpl]sfn|Gibson|1984|p=193[/tpl] City Council received approval from the Government of Canada to spend $976,000[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Past Plans for Island Access |date=August 4, 1954 |page=6[/tpl] ($[tpl]formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|CA|976000|1935[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] dollars)[tpl]inflation-fn|CA[/tpl] on a tunnel under the Western Gap.[tpl]sfn|Gibson|1984|p=192[/tpl] That fall, after construction began, a federal election was held and William Lyon Mackenzie King was elected as prime minister. King's government reversed the previous government's decision and cancelled the tunnel.[tpl]sfn|Gibson|1984|p=193[/tpl]
Trans-Canada Air Lines was expected to begin operations in 1937, so in November 1936, City Council (without McBride, who died days earlier) formed an "Advisory Airport Committee" to advise on where to build a municipal airport.[tpl]sfn|Gibson|1984|p=195[/tpl] The committee proposed several locations and of these two were approved by the Government of Canada, which agreed to fund one-quarter of the project. The two sites were the Island and Malton, north-west of Toronto. A seaplane and land airport would be built at the island, and an auxiliary field was to be built at Malton.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Globe |title=Howe Approves Island for Toronto's Airport |page=1 |date=May 28, 1937[/tpl] The project would fill in the regatta lagoon and extend the airport site on both the east and west sides. After two days of debate, City Council voted 14–7 to approve the construction of both airports.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=July 10, 1937 |title=Island and Malton Sites Are Approved For Airport |page=3[/tpl]
The site of the airport had been home to a baseball stadium, numerous cottages, amusement park attractions and the regatta course.[tpl]sfn|Gibson|1984|p=197[/tpl] The 54 cottages and their cottagers were moved to today's Algonquin Island (then named Sunfish Island).[tpl]sfn|Gibson|1984|p=197[/tpl] The seaplane base was first used in 1938. The paved runways and the terminal building were opened in 1939. In April 1939, Toronto Council voted to name the airport Port George VI Island Airport to commemorate an upcoming visit by King George VI in May 1939.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Globe |date=April 4, 1939 |page=4 |title=Holiday May 22 to Honor King[/tpl] The first commercial passenger flight to the airport was a charter flight carrying Tommy Dorsey and his swing band for a two-day engagement at the Canadian National Exhibition on September 8, 1939. It was also the first airliner from the United States to arrive in Toronto.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Globe |date=September 9, 1939 |page=4 |title=Swing Band Flown Here on Giant U.S. Airliner[/tpl] Instead of the tunnel, ferry service was inaugurated across the narrow Western Gap channel. The first ferry service was a cable ferry, which was rated to carry 48 persons.
During World War II, the island airport became a military training base. From 1940 until 1943, the Norwegian Government in-exile used the island airport as a training facility for the Royal Norwegian Air Force. Barracks were built nearby on the mainland at the foot of Bathurst Street.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Hundreds of Norsemen Will Learn To Fly Here |date=August 7, 1940 |page=4[/tpl] The nearby 'Little Norway Park' is named in remembrance of the Norwegian community around the airport. For the duration of the war the airport was used by the Royal Canadian Air Force for training pilots and as a waypoint for transporting planes.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Island Airport Is Busy With Variety of Jobs |date=June 14, 1944 |page=10[/tpl] After the war, the airport returned to civilian uses. Flying clubs and several aviation companies set up at the airport, offering services such as aircraft rentals, air freight, charter flights, pilot training and sight-seeing flights.

===1950s–1960s===

By the end of 1952, the accumulated cost of running the Island Airport, and paying the interest on the debt of construction, totalled $752,000.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Island Airport Cost City $752,000 Since 1939 |date=November 4, 1953 |page=5[/tpl] ($[tpl]formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|CA|752000|1952[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] dollars)[tpl]inflation-fn|CA[/tpl] Toronto Mayor Allan A. Lamport, one of the original supporters in 1937 of building the Island Airport, began a renewed effort, along with the Harbour Commission to expand the airport, hoping to make it profitable. He pushed for a deal to turn over Malton Airport to the Government of Canada in exchange for improvements at the Island.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Balfour Raps Rolland; Ratepayers Applaud |date=November 27, 1954 |page=4 [/tpl] The Government of Canada was amenable to the deal, and expanding the Island Airport, and installed an air traffic control system in 1953, but no comprehensive agreement was yet made. Agreement was reached in July 1955, but an impasse arose between the governments over the terms of the agreement. The impasse was settled in 1957.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Open Bids, No Award For Channel Dredging |date=May 18, 1957 |page=5[/tpl] Runway construction began in 1959 and was finished in 1960.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |date=September 9, 1959 |title=Island Airport Traffic Sets New 2-Month Record |page=5[/tpl]

For 1961, the airport recorded 212,735 movements, of which 168,272 were for local traffic, including student flights. By number of movements, the airport was the busiest in Canada.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Traffic Volume Makes Toronto Air Capital |date=March 1, 1962 |page=25[/tpl] However, the cost of operating at the Island airport forced the Club to close and sell its 12 planes after less than a year. It resurrected itself at Malton in 1963.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Toronto Flying Club Takes to the Air Again |date=June 7, 1963 |page=5[/tpl]
The airport improvements, including a new hangar, the new [tpl]Convert|4000|ft|abbr=on|0[/tpl] main runway, and night-time landing lights, were completed in 1962. The new lights allowed the first use of the airport for night-time flights since World War II when Norwegian flyers practised night-time flights.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |date=July 14, 1962 |title=Night-Flying Test At Island Succeeds |page=5[/tpl] Night-time flights began on April 15, 1963, and the airport extended its closing hour from one half-hour before sun-down to midnight.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Island Airport Now Prepared For Night Flight |date=April 16, 1963 |page=5[/tpl] The Government of Canada spent $3,118,500 on the improvements.

In January 1964, the cable ferry was retired, replaced by the Harbour Commission tugboat Thomas Langton That year, interest by municipal government officials was renewed in a new link to the airport. Takeoffs and landings had declined from the 1961 peak to 189,000 in 1962 and 187,000 in 1963, despite the addition of night-time capability.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |date=February 27, 1964 |title=Tunnel to the Island Airport |last=Baker |first=Alden |page=7[/tpl] The decline was attributed to two factors: the limited access and poor service the ferry provided and the opening of the Buttonville Municipal Airport north of Toronto in 1962. The City of Toronto, spurred by Allan Lamport, wanted the Government of Canada to provide a better ferry, or a lift bridge. The Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) planning department studied a proposal to build a bridge, although full automobile access was opposed by the Metro Commissioner of Parks, Tommy Thompson, whose department was clearing the Islands of residents to convert the lands to parks. The Maple City, capable of carrying vehicles as well as passengers, took over the ferry service in March 1965.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Link With Island Airport In Service |date=March 27, 1965 |page=5[/tpl]
In 1967, the Harbour Commission initiated a study into converting the airport into one suitable for the passenger jets of the day, such as DC-8s. The island airport runways were too short for jets, so a new airport would have to be built on new land reclaimed from Lake Ontario.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |date=April 25, 1967 |title=Study envisages major waterfront airport for downtown Toronto |page=B01 |last=Romain |first=Ken[/tpl] The Commission developed this further into a full redevelopment of the Islands, whereby a residential development, entitled Harbor City would be built on the existing island airport lands, and a new airport with a runway long enough for jets would be built on a peninsula parallel to the south shore of the Toronto island. This plan also outlined the development of a new harbour, the Outer Harbour east of the Eastern Gap.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |date=January 11, 1968 |title=Allen urges 3-government group to guide waterfront plan |page=5 |last=Sagi |first=Douglas[/tpl] The plan was later modified to situate the new Island Airport on the Outer Harbour headland, east of the Islands, with road access available from the Gardiner Expressway south along Leslie Street.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Airport-on-the-lake proposed for Toronto |date=March 6, 1969 |page=B3 |last=Romain |first=Ken[/tpl] Although the plan was approved by Metropolitan Toronto and the Government of Ontario, the Government of Canada ruled out the waterfront site for a major airport early in 1970, although Transport Minister Donald Jamieson suggested there would be some sort of expanded airport serving "short-hop, inter-city" flights created.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Malton Field may expand for new jets |page=1 |date=February 5, 1970[/tpl]

===1970s–1980s===

By 1970, the annual operating deficit (the cost of operating the airport minus revenues collected) of the airport had reached $200,000. ($[tpl]formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|CA|200000|1970[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] dollars)[tpl]inflation-fn|CA[/tpl] Toronto Mayor Dennison warned that the airport could be closed as the Harbour Commission did not want to absorb the amount.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Island Airport Faces Deficit of $200,00; field may be closed |date=August 6, 1970 |page=5 |last=Baker |first=Alden[/tpl] At the time, the island airport site was slated to be the site of the Harbor City residential development, although a replacement for the island airport had not been agreed upon. A 1969 proposal to build a new airport by the new headland was met with opposition from local residents and Toronto City Councillors and was dropped.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |page=1 |title=Plan to build waterfront airport insane, alderman says |date=May 28, 1974 |last=Coleman |first=Thomas[/tpl] With plans uncertain, the Government of Canada requested that the Harbour Commission continue to operate the airport as is in the interim.
In 1972, the Harbor City project died when the governments of Canada and Ontario proposed to build a new major airport in Pickering, Ontario. At the same time, the Government of Canada initiated a feasibility study of converting the island airport to a major airport for Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) planes.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |date=March 3, 1972 |pages=1–2 |title=City of 200,00 to rise near airport in Pickering |last=Slinger |first=John[/tpl] Later that year, the Harbour Commission announced plans for an aquatic park on the Outer Harbour headland, the location in the 1968 plan for the relocated island airport.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Island network proposed by harbour commission |page=33 |date=March 28, 1972 |last=Baker |first=Alden [/tpl]
In 1973, de Havilland Aircraft of Canada, makers of the new DHC-7 (Dash 7) STOL plane, proposed a network of STOL airports around Ontario, with the Island Airport as its hub, to the Government of Ontario cabinet ministers and the Government of Canada cabinet ministers. The first versions of the Dash 7 could support flights from the Island to smaller centres, such as Sarnia, Kingston, Peterborough and Owen Sound, with a larger version able to support flights to larger centres such as London, North Bay, Ottawa and Windsor. The island airport, which operated under visual flight rules, would have to be upgraded to instrument flight rules to operate the service. De Havilland also proposed a bridge to the island airport over the Western Gap.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=de Havilland plan for Ontario STOL network would use island airport as the hub |date=March 9, 1973 |page=45 |last=Coleman |first=Thomas [/tpl] The Government of Ontario was interested in the proposal, and asked the Canadian government to work towards development of STOL. Ontario Intergovernmental Minister John White characterized "regional air service in southern Ontario as totally deficient."[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title= |date=May 30, 1973 |page= 8[/tpl]
By 1974, the annual operating deficit of running the airport had reached $300,000 per year ($[tpl]formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|CA|300000|1974[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] dollars)[tpl]inflation-fn|CA[/tpl], $130,000 of it in operating the Maple City ferry.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Keep Island Airport going, report says |date=October 21, 1974 |page=5[/tpl] The City of Toronto decided to ask the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada to cover the deficit. After study by the Toronto, Metro, Ontario and Canadian governments, the Government of Canada agreed to grant an annual subsidy to the Harbour Commission to operate the airport, while the Government of Ontario agreed to pay for the costs of the airport ferry.[tpl]sfn|Tassé|2006|p=10[/tpl] The Government of Canada put a condition on the subsidy, that intergovernmental agreement needed to be reached on the future of the airport. Agreement on the future of the airport would take several years.
In January 1975, Otonabee Airways launched the first scheduled passenger service at the airport. Otonabee operated a three-times a day service between the island airport and Montreal's international airport.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=January 14, 1975 |title=$38 commuter air service starts between island airport, Montreal |page=A11 [/tpl] 1975 was also the year that the island airport was used as the base for Olga, a Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane helicopter used to dismantle the crane of the new CN Tower under construction and hoist sections of its new antenna into place on top of its concrete tower.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Big Olga is flexing her muscles to finish off the CN Tower |date=March 6, 1975 |page=A03 |last=Harkala |first=Arnie[/tpl]
In April 1978, Transport Minister Otto Lang announced a plan to provide daily scheduled airline service between the airport, Ottawa and Montreal, using de Havilland Dash 7 STOL planes.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |date=April 20, 1978 |page=P1 |title=Ottawa would alter Island Airport for STOL[/tpl] The Government of Canada would invest $5 million in improvements at the airport including a covered moving pedestrian sidewalk linking the airport with Lake Shore Boulevard.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Lang's plan for island airport: 25 scheduled flights per day |date=April 20, 1978 |pages=A01–A02 |last=Conrad |first=Richard[/tpl] The plan was rejected by Toronto City Council,[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Short takeoff flights rejected |date=August 17, 1978 |page=C22[/tpl] and the Canadian Transport Commission turned down the plan stating that the airport's services were not satisfactory and required upgrading.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |last=Simpson |first=Jeffrey |date=October 21, 1980 |page=P9 |title=CTC delays onset of STOL service at island airport[/tpl]
Art Eggleton was elected Toronto mayor and a compromise was reached in 1981, when the City of Toronto agreed to a limited level of commercial STOL passenger service, and the exclusion of jet airplanes. A memorandum of understanding was signed by the THC, the City and Transport Canada, and in 1982, the Canadian Transport Commission issued a licence to City Centre Airways to operate Dash 7 planes between the island, Ottawa and Montreal.[tpl]sfn|Tassé|2006|p=11[/tpl] In 1983, the City of Toronto, the THC, and the Government of Canada signed a tripartite agreement over operation of the airport. The agreement, in force until 2033, leases the land for the airport at a rate of $1 per year. The majority of the airport land is owned by the Government of Ontario with two small sections owned by the Government of Canada and a small section owned by Toronto. The agreement made provisions for a restricted list of aircraft allowed to use the airport due to noise levels, prohibitions on jet traffic except for MEDEVAC flights and prohibition against the construction of a fixed link between Toronto Island and the mainland. According to the Tassé report: "The Tripartite Agreement does not directly set a maximum number of flights or passengers at the Island Airport; it does, however, establish noise exposure parameters which are not to be exceeded (NEF 25), thus effectively providing restrictions on the number of flights."[tpl]sfn|Tassé|2006|p=12[/tpl] The number and type of flights are to stay within the Noise Exposure Forecast (NEF) 25 exposure level to neighbours. The agreement was amended in 1985 to specifically allow the new de Havilland Dash 8, small 37–39 seat planes at the time, which are not considered STOL planes.[tpl]sfn|Tassé|2006|p=12[/tpl]
In 1984, Air Atonabee, (as Otonabee Airways had been renamed in 1980) was re-organized into a new regional airline known as City Express. From 1984 until 1991, City Express continued and expanded its operations at the airport, peaking at 400,000 passengers annually in the mid-1980s.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=July 26, 2001 |page=B07 |author=Harding, Katherine |title=Group urges turning airport to park[/tpl]

===1990–present===

Airport passenger traffic declined in the 1990s. Although a new airline entered the island marketplace, City Express folded. In the early 1990s there was a further decline due to an economic downturn. Additionally, the airport lost its subsidies from the Province of Ontario and Government of Canada. Around the same period Toronto Harbour Commission began to receive an annual subsidy from the City of Toronto.[tpl]sfn|Tassé|2006|pp=35–37[/tpl] During the 1990s, the Harbour Commission transferred much of its harbour lands to the City of Toronto for economic development and waterfront revitalization in exchange for future subsidies.
In 1990, Air Ontario (later to become Air Canada Jazz) started operating regional airline service to Ottawa and Montreal. That year, City Express folded in bankruptcy. In 1994, Jazz built a new terminal, moving out of trailers. That year, the airport was renamed the Toronto City Centre Airport.
The Toronto Harbour Commission made plans to expand the airport so as to achieve self-sufficiency, as it was dependent on subsidies from the City of Toronto.[tpl]sfn|Tassé|2006|pp=35–37[/tpl] The situation lead the THC to transfer much of its land to the City in exchange for an on-going subsidy. In 1992, the THC proposed to build a bridge to the airport for safety reasons and as an improvement, at a cost of $8 million. THC's plans were initially opposed by Toronto City Council, but after the THC threatened to close the airport, an agreement was reached. Council agreed to a bridge on condition of continuing the 'no jets' ban, and that it not be built with Toronto tax dollars.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Toronto endorses airport expansion |date=October 17, 1995 |page=A3 |first=Paul |last1=Moloney[/tpl] After the City of Toronto was amalgamated, the plan was re-opened, and a tunnel proposed instead, but the new Toronto City Council approved a bridge in 1998.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=City gives go-ahead for bridge to Toronto island airport |date=December 17, 1998 |page=1 |last1=Moloney |first1=Paul |last2=DeMara |first2=Paul[/tpl]
In 1999, the operation of the airport was turned over to the new Toronto Port Authority (TPA), which took over the responsibilities of the Harbour Commission, including the airport and port functions.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Toronto Port Authority |url=http://www.torontoport.com/airport_history.asp?id=164 |title=Toronto City Centre Airport: A History |accessdate=September 22, 2009[/tpl] Unlike the previous Harbour Commission, the Port Authority used a different management structure and a different management focus. Its new board of directors contained fewer members appointed by the City of Toronto. The Authority was also expected to manage the port more like a business. A review of the airport operations concluded that the airport "is not sustainable and will likely lead to continued financial losses."[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |page=A17 |last=Immen |first=Wallace |date=January 18, 2002 |title=Airport study ignores health issues, critics say[/tpl] Passenger volumes had declined to 140,000 annually from a peak of 400,000 in 1987. The consultants concluded that if services were upgraded to include small jets, that possibly 900,000 passengers could be carried by 2020. The report proposed a $16 million bridge and $2 million in runway upgrades.
By 2005, the airport recorded about 68,000 flights,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/51-209-x/2010001/t002-eng.htm |title=Total aircraft movements by class of operation – NAV CANADA towers |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=March 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 17, 2011[/tpl] down from a historic high of 240,000 in 1967.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Toronto Port Authority |url=http://www.torontoport.com/airport_facts.asp |title=Toronto City Centre Airport Facts |accessdate=November 11, 2009[/tpl] The only carrier operating at the airport was Air Canada affiliate Air Canada Jazz, operating flights between Toronto and Ottawa. In 2006, Jazz lost access to terminal space at the airport and was forced out of the airport. Jazz had been leasing terminal space month-to-month from City Centre Aviation Limited (CCAL), a private company that was taken over by REGCO Holdings, a new company led by Robert Deluce, in 2005. On January 31, 2006, CCAL issued Jazz with a 30-day termination notice.[tpl]Cite news |work=National Post |location=Canada |title=Air Canada suspends its Jazz flights out of island airport for the month of March |date=February 16, 2006 |page=11[/tpl] Two days later, on February 2, REGCO's new Porter Airlines venture was announced.[tpl]Cite news |title=New island airline faces turbulent takeoff |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |last=Gray |first=Jeff |date=February 3, 2006 |page=A11[/tpl] Jazz contacted the TPA on February 3 to find other space.

This subsequently became permanent.
Porter Airlines began regional airline service with flights to Ottawa in the fall of 2006 using Q400 series Dash 8 planes, 70-seat aircraft. Its entry into service was met by protesters who attempted to block passengers from the airport. Porter has since expanded to other destinations in Canada and the United States.

At its annual meeting on September 3, 2009, the TPA announced that it would rename the airport after William Avery "Billy" Bishop, a Canadian First World War flying ace.

===Proposed expansion===

In April 2013, Porter announced a conditional purchase of 12 Bombardier CS100 passenger jets, with an option to purchase 18 more. Porter president Robert Deluce announced that the airline would seek an extension of the main runway by 336 m, [tpl]Convert|168|m|ft[/tpl] at either end,[tpl]cite news |work=Maclean's |url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/04/10/porter-airlines-seeks-to-land-jets-at-base-in-toronto-wants-to-extend-runway/ |author=Canadian Press |title=Porter Airlines seeks to land jets at base in Toronto, wants to extend runway |date=April 10, 2013[/tpl] to accommodate the longer landing and takeoff requirements of the aircraft. The airline would also seek an exemption for the CS100 aircraft from the jet ban at the airport imposed in the 1983 Tripartite Agreement of the airport.[tpl]cite news |work=CBC News |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2013/04/10/business-porter-bombardier.html |title=Porter aims to become 3rd national airline |date=April 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 10, 2013[/tpl] The changes would require the agreement of the Government of Canada, the Toronto Port Authority and the City of Toronto. The TPA announced that it would await the direction of Toronto City Council on the potential expansion. A new community group "NoJetsTO" was formed to collect opposition to the plan to allow jets at the airport. The City of Toronto started consultations in September 2013, both online and at "town hall" sessions, to produce a report from staff for presentation to Council. As consultations began, Porter increased its request to 200 metre extensions at each end of the runway.[tpl]cite news |work=CBC News |title=Porter flies 2nd proposal for island airport expansion |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2013/09/04/toronto-island-airport-porter-consultations.html |date=September 4, 2013[/tpl] The Toronto Port Authority notified the City of Toronto that it was seeking an extension to the tripartite agreement beyond 2033 as a condition of the runway extension plan.[tpl]cite web |publisher=City of Toronto |url=http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/viewAgendaItemHistory.do?item=2013.EX36.7 |title=Executive Committee Item EX36.7: Request to Amend the Tripartite Agreement for Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport[/tpl] 
The staff report was released to the public on November 28, 2013 and staff recommended putting off consideration of the plan until 2015, due to incomplete information and the various unresolved issues, including the CS100 noise information, Transport Canada regulations, and Toronto Port Authority requirements. The report also noted that the airport does not have a "Master Plan" unlike other airports, and staff suggested is essential for consideration to extend the tripartite agreement.[tpl]cite news |work=680 News |title=City urged to delay Porter Airlines expansion decision |url=http://www.680news.com/2013/11/28/city-urged-to-delay-porter-airlines-expansion-decision-report/ |first1=Charlene |last1=Close |first2=Showwei |last2=Chu |date=November 28, 2013[/tpl] The plan is to be discussed by the City Council executive committee and full Council in December 2013.

==Facilities==

The airport is located on the Toronto Islands, south-west of Downtown Toronto. The airport has one main east-west runway, two shorter runways, and a seaplane base, Billy Bishop Toronto City Water Aerodrome. The airport is used for regional airline service and for general aviation, including medical emergency flights (due to its proximity to downtown hospitals), small charter flights, and private aviation. Under its operating agreement, jet aircraft are banned from the airport, with the exception of MEDEVAC flights.
The airport is operated as a division of the Toronto Port Authority (TPA), a federal corporation, which manages Toronto harbour also. The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.torontoport.ca/PortAuthority/airport_pilot_info.asp?id=20 |publisher=Toronto Port Authority |title=Pilot Info:Flight Planning |accessdate=October 5, 2009[/tpl] The airport's hours of operation are 6:45 am to 11:00 pm, except for MEDEVAC flights. The airport's hours are governed by the 2003 update of the Tripartite Agreement which set the hours of operation.[tpl]sfn|Tassé|2006|p=39[/tpl] Airfield crash fire rescue and EMS are provided by the TCCA Emergency Response Service, backed up by Toronto Fire Services and Toronto EMS.

===Public access===

The only public access to the airport from the mainland is by ferry, currently the 200-passenger ferry Marilyn Bell I, with the 150-passenger David Hornell V.C. as a backup vessel. At only [tpl]Convert|122|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in distance, the route is one of the world's shortest regularly scheduled ferry routes. The ferry, which transports vehicles (for a fee) and passengers (free), operates from a dock at Eireann Quay to the airport dock every 15 minutes from 5:15 am to midnight (the 5:15 ferry is for airport staff; airline passengers can begin crossing at 5:30).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.torontoport.com/PortAuthority/airport_location_access.asp?id=160 |title=Ferry Schedule |publisher=Toronto Port Authority |accessdate=January 13, 2010[/tpl]
There is a taxi stand and a small parking lot east the ferry dock. There is a larger parking lot west of the ferry dock off Stadium Road, and parking is also available on the island adjacent to the airport terminal. The 509 Harbourfront streetcar line serves the intersection of Bathurst Street and Queens Quay, one block north of the ferry dock, connecting the airport to Union Station. The airport offers free return bus shuttle service between the Fairmont Royal York Hotel and the airport ferry dock.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flyporter.com/Travel/Directions-How-To-Get-To?culture=en-CA |title=Directions to Airports |publisher=Porter Airlines |accessdate=August 18, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aircanada.com/en/offers/air/toronto_airport/toronto_airport.html |title=Toronto Island Airport – Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport |publisher=Air Canada |accessdate=August 18, 2011[/tpl]
In 2012, construction began on a pedestrian tunnel which will provide additional access to the airport. The tunnel is projected to be completed in 2014. Ferry service will continue after completion of the tunnel to transport vehicles, fuel, and supplies.

===Tenants and terminals===

There is one terminal and several hangars:

===Fire and rescue===

The airport operates a fire and rescue service to deal with emergencies at the airport. The current apparatus at the airport consist of:
Toronto Police Service marine unit vessels and Toronto Fire Service fire boats (William Lyon Mackenzie and Sora) can provide rescue operations in the waters near the airport.

==Airlines and destinations==

The TPA imposes a $20 airport improvement fee surcharge on each passenger boarding scheduled flights.[ref]
</ref>
Connecting between Canadian and U.S. destinations occurs at the airport by means of following "Connections" signage. These passengers receive a secondary security screen at this point (as residents of Toronto flying to the U.S. will have to have a preliminary screen). Passengers flying to Thunder Bay and Sudbury (even when flying from another Canadian destination) are obligated to go through the second screening because Canadian destinations outnumber U.S. destinations. The airport was forced to add those two destinations to the complement of American destined passengers to facilitate the screening process in the small facility.https://www.flyporter.com/Travel/Connecting-Flights?culture=en-CA

==Disputes==

===Dispute over payments in lieu of taxes to the City of Toronto===

Federal agencies such as the TPA make a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) for property they own that is not leased to third parties. Such entities pay property taxes on property leased to third parties. By 2009, the City estimated that the TPA owed $37 million in unpaid PILT for all its properties. The PILT was based on the assessed value as calculated by the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation, which assesses all property for the province of Ontario. The City and the TPA presented their case before a federal dispute advisory panel. On January 26, 2009, the Dispute Advisory Panel recommended that TPA pay PILT for the airport on a per passenger basis of 80 cents per passenger. This amount was based on various considerations including similar payments made by other airports, which make the payments based on passenger numbers. At the time of the ruling, Pearson International Airport paid 94 cents per passenger.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=January 27, 2009 |last=Moloney |first=Paul |url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/577774 |title=City's return on island airport nosedives |accessdate=January 30, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5o5bYwXHS |archivedate=March 9, 2010[/tpl] On February 10, 2009, the City applied for a judicial review to the Federal Court of Canada.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/February2009/10/c7346.html |title=Toronto Port Authority responds to City of Toronto's application for a judicial review of property valuation recommendations |publisher=Toronto Port Authority |accessdate=February 11, 2009 |date=February 10, 2009[/tpl]
The Federal Court struck down the January 2009 DAP report, recommending a hearing before a new DAP, with TPA maintaining the right to appeal the court’s decision. In an attempt to settle outstanding legal issues between the parties, the TPA and the City entered into a Settlement Agreement. Pursuant to the Agreement, TPA and the City agreed, among other things, to meet and work together to review and resolve issues regarding PILTs. Under the agreement the City agreed to pay $11.4 million owing on payments related to previous land transfers and $380,559 owing on harbour user fees. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement the TPA agreed to pay the City $6.4 million on account for PILTs for tax years 1999-2008 on a without prejudice basis, with the parties maintaining their rights to request a new DAP or apply for judicial review.[tpl]cite web|title=Toronto Port Authority and City of Toronto reach macro solution to a wide variety of outstanding issues|url=http://www.torontoport.com/About-TPA/Media-Room/Press-Releases/Toronto-Port-Authority-and-City-of-Toronto-reach-m.aspx|publisher=Toronto Port Authority|accessdate=7 June 2013|date=November 25, 2009[/tpl] The Agreement, which was ratified by Toronto City Council, was made in conjunction with the transfer of [tpl]Convert|18|acre|ha[/tpl] of land at Leslie Street and Lake Shore Boulevard for a proposed Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) light rail storage facility.[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.torontoport.com/PortAuthority/media_content.asp?id=410 |title=Toronto Port Authority and City of Toronto reach "macro solution" to a wide variety of outstanding issues |accessdate=November 12, 2009 |date=November 25, 2009 |author=Toronto Port Authority[/tpl][tpl]cite news |work=Inside Toronto |date=November 26, 2009 |accessdate=November 26, 2009 |title=City on verge of obtaining port lands for $345-million TTC facility |url=http://www.insidetoronto.com/news/cityhall/article/217647--ttc-toronto-port-authority-reach-deal-on-land-for-light-rail-vehicle-storage |author=Nickle, David[/tpl] As of February 28, 2013, the TPA had paid PILT of $11.66 million for the years 1999 to 2012, inclusive, which was a rate of 80 cents per passenger.[tpl]cite web|author= McQueen, Mark|title=Toronto Port Authority Chairman|url=http://www.torontoport.com/getattachment/a5c89cb0-19ba-4219-a11b-e3b9b5807de4/Letter-to-MP-Olivia-Chow.aspx|publisher=Toronto Port Authority|accessdate=7 June 2013[/tpl]

===Bridge proposal===

Since 1935, there have been repeated plans to construct either tunnels or a bridge to the airport. The airport continued to require public subsidies and various expansion plans, including jets and airport enlargement were seen as a way to increase its usage and make the airport self-sufficient. Meanwhile during this time, the downtown area surrounding the airport was redeveloped. Whereas it was once port lands and industrial buildings, the area changed with the coming of Harbourfront Centre, which sparked condominium tower development along the waterfront near the airport and increasing the number of residents in the area.
Opposition to the airport was formalized into the Community AIR (Airport Impact Review) volunteer association in 2001, headed by the late activist and former councillor Allan Sparrow. It was formed by local residents to oppose expansion on the grounds of increased air and noise pollution, safety concerns and that the increase in air traffic will hamper recent government initiatives to rejuvenate the Toronto waterfront.[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |date=June 16, 2001 |page=A18 |last=Immen |first=Wallace |title=Citizens want a say in island airport study[/tpl] In July 2001, at a news conference held with representatives of the Sierra Club, the David Suzuki Foundation and the Toronto Environmental Alliance, the group proposed converting the [tpl]Convert|200|acres|ha[/tpl] airport to parkland.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=July 26, 2001 |last=Harding |first=Katherine |page=B07[/tpl] Community Air was and is supported by the City councillors of the area.
It emerged during 2002, that Robert Deluce, former executive with Canada 3000, proposed to fly regional turboprop planes from the island airport. Deluce's proposal was initially conditional on the construction of a fixed link to the airport. In 2002, the TPA made plans to link the island to the mainland by a new bridge to serve expanded services.
At the same time, the TPA was pursuing a $1 billion lawsuit against the City of Toronto over some [tpl]Convert|600|acre|ha[/tpl] of port-lands it claimed were transferred improperly to the Toronto Economic Development Corporation by the TPA's predecessor, the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC), in the early 1990s during the mayorship of June Rowlands[tpl]cite news |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |title=Taxpayers hit both ways in TPA lawsuit |last=Barber |first=John |date=November 7, 2002 |page=A26[/tpl] The port-lands had been transferred under the direction of THC directors appointed by the City in exchange for a permanent subsidy of the THC under agreements made in 1991 and 1994.[tpl]sfn|Tassé|2006|p=38[/tpl] The lands had been earmarked for waterfront revitalization by the City after the Crombie Commission. The lawsuit would emerge as a factor in the TPA's plans for expansion of the airport, and City Council support for the TPA's plans for a new bridge became conditional upon the lawsuit being dropped.
The proposal to link the airport with a bridge had been previously approved by Toronto City Council in 1995 and 1998, with the proviso that a business plan would be presented for approval by the THC and later the TPA for operating the airport. In November 2002, City Council met to debate the competing proposals, that of closing the airport in favour of some parkland, or of approving the TPA's plans and having uncontested title to the port lands. Despite pleas from former mayor David Crombie, urban planner/activist Jane Jacobs and Harbourfront residents, the TPA plan was supported by then-mayor Mel Lastman, who argued that the estimated $190 million of annual economic benefit the airport would create, was too good to pass up.[tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Star |author=Moloney, Paul |date=November 29, 2002 |page=B02 |title=Bridge to Island okayed ; Spring start for airport project expected Environmental opponents vow to keep on fighting[/tpl] On November 28, 2002, Council in a day-long debate, made two votes to settle the issue.

Councillor David Miller ran for Mayor on a platform to stop the building of the bridge, a position supported by Community Air and other local community groups.

===Late-night landings===

At the 2009 TPA annual meeting, concerns were raised about landings at the airport after the 11 pm closing time. Local residents had two concerns: the late-night noise and safety. Control tower staff are not present at Bishop after 11 pm (a practice that is very common at most smaller Canadian airports). In one specific incident in September 2008, a late Porter flight was advised by air traffic controllers to divert to Pearson, but instead landed at Bishop. For the landing, Porter was fined an undisclosed amount by the TPA. Under the airport's curfew agreement, each commercial landing outside the airport's curfew may be subject to a fine of [tpl]cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=September 4, 2009 |author=Lu, Vanessa; McLean, Jesse |title=Sparks fly over late landings |url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/690866 |accessdate=September 4, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5o5bob4E5 |archivedate=March 9, 2010[/tpl] $10,000.

===Increase in number of flights===

On October 19, 2009, the TPA published a press release indicating that other carriers were interested in using the airport and that it was accepting expressions of interest. The TPA noted that any increase in commercial traffic would be within the 1983 tripartite agreement governing usage and noise limits.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.torontoport.com/PortAuthority/notices/eoi_oct_09.pdf |title=Toronto Port Authority accepting expressions of interest regarding Toronto City Centre Airport |format=PDF |date=October 19, 2009 |publisher=Toronto Port Authority |accessdate=November 10, 2009[/tpl] In December 2009, the TPA announced that it would allow up between 42 and 92 daily landings and takeoffs at the airport, beyond the current 120 per day 'slots' allotted. The slots would be allocated by an International Air Transport Association (IATA)-accredited slot coordinator. These slots would become available after Porter's new terminal building was complete.[tpl]cite press release |date=December 24, 2010 |url=http://www.torontoport.com/PortAuthority/notices/Toronto%20Port%20Authority%20Slot%20Bulletin%20-%202009%20Dec%2024.pdf |publisher=Toronto Port Authority| title=TPA announces capacity assessment results for Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, begins accepting formal carrier proposals |format=pdf[/tpl]

In April 2010, the TPA confirmed the final results from the capacity assessment study for the BBTCA conducted by a third-party consultant, Jacobs Consultancy. The study considered that existing BBTCA commercial carrier operations would utilize approximately 112 slots in the period leading up to the pending allocation of additional slots, and recommended that the maximum number of commercial slots available at the BBTCA be increased by 90, to 202, upon the completion of the new terminal.[tpl]cite web|title=TPA issues formal Request for Proposals for additional carriers at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport|url=http://www.torontoport.com/About-TPA/Media-Room/Press-Releases/TPA-issues-formal-Request-for-Proposals-for-additi.aspx|publisher=Toronto Port Authority|accessdate=7 June 2013[/tpl]
