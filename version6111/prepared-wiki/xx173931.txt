[[Parti National (Quebec)]]

CATEGORIES: Provincial political parties in Quebec, Political parties established in 1885

The Parti National was the name taken by the Liberal Party of Quebec, Canada, under the premiership of Honoré Mercier.

==Origin and beliefs==

It was founded on November 17, 1885, the day following the execution of Métis Leader Louis Riel.  Many French-speaking Catholics resented the way the federal government of Sir John A. Macdonald had Riel hanged for treason.  Mercier proposed to create a broader coalition which would include Conservative dissidents as well as his Liberal base.  In the following days 50,000 people gathered in the Champ de Mars in Montreal to hear Mercier voice their support for Riel.Susan Mann, The Dream of Nation: A Social and Intellectual History of Quebec, 2002
The Parti National, which was not officially affiliated to any federal party, promised to use the influence of the provincial government protect the autonomy of Quebec and of its French-speaking and Catholic identity.

==Rise to power==

The party won a narrow majority of seats to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the 1886 provincial election and took office in January 1887.  It won a landslide victory in the 1890 election, doing poorly only in the Mauricie area where it was opposed by Ultramontan Catholic Bishop Louis-François Richer Laflèche.

==Decline==

With only 18 months served in its second term of office, the National Party was caught in a corruption scandal and removed from office by Quebec Lieutenant-governor Auguste-Réal Angers.  Mercier stepped down as party leader and the Liberals were overwhelmingly defeated in the 1892 election.
