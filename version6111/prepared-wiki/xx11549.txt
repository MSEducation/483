V-chip is a generic term for technology used in television set receivers in Canada, Brazil and the USA, which allows the blocking of programs based on their ratings category. It is intended for use by parents to manage their children's television viewing. Televisions manufactured for the United States market since 1999 and all units as of January 2000 are required to have the V-chip technology.[tpl]cite web|title=Commissioner Gloria Tristani commends manufacturers for meeting deadlines to install V-chips in televisions |url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Miscellaneous/News_Releases/1999/nrmc9040.html|publisher=FCC|accessdate=23 June 2010|authorlink=Federal Communications Commission|date=9 June 1999|quote=The rules adopted by the Commission require that, as of July 1, 1999, half of all new televisions with screens of 13" or greater be equipped with a V-Chip and that all such televisions be equipped with this technology as of January 1, 2000.[/tpl] The idea for blocking programs in this way was patented by Brett West and John P. Gardner in 1994[tpl]cite web|title=Two inventors contend that the V-chip is an idea they've seen before -- in their own patent.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/28/business/two-inventors-contend-that-v-chip-idea-they-ve-seen-before-their-own-patent.html?pagewanted=1|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=23 June 2010|author=Teresa Riordan|format=News|date=28 October 1996[/tpl] and tested in Canada. Since then many devices using V-chip technology have been produced.
V-chip technology works much like closed captioning and uses the vertical blanking interval in the television signal. The system receives a special code in the broadcast signal which indicates the show's score according to a simple numerical rating system for violence, sex, and language.Montgomery, Kathryn C. Generation Digital:politics, commerce, and childhood in the age of the internet. (2007) The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press. The programs' signals are encoded according to their rating, on line 21 of the broadcast signal's vertical blanking interval using the XDS protocol, and this is detected by the television set's V-chip. If the program rating is outside the level configured as acceptable on that particular television the program is blocked. The V-chip does not block news or sports casts as this sort of programming does not have ratings.
The V-chip has a four-digit numerical password in order to keep older children from changing its settings. However it can be overridden by anyone who reads the television's manual to find out how to reset the password to 0000 (built into the V-chip in case the parents themselves forget the password that they set).
The phrase "V-chip" was purportedly coined by Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts.  According to him the "V" stands for "violence".  However, in an interview with Tim Collings, one of the people who claim to have invented the device, he says that it was intended to stand for "viewer control."[ref]

==History==

In 1975, the Family Viewing Hour was introduced in the United States, in which broadcasters had to play TV content suitable for all ages. This idea was quickly done away with because broadcasters felt it violated their First Amendment rights by restricting what content they could play.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] The inventor of the V-chip technology originally meant for it to be a simple tool that parents could use[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] if they felt strongly about monitoring their children's television viewing. He had no idea it would become a national standard for all televisions to contain.[tpl]cite web | url = http://library.thinkquest.org/5676/collings.html | title = Interview with Mr. Tim Collings | accessdate = 2010-06-23[/tpl]

==Implementation==

In 1993, Keith Spicer met with top American executives and disclosed information about the V-Chip Technology.[tpl]cite book | last = Price | first = Monroe Edwin | title = The V-Chip Debate: Content Filtering From Television to the Internet | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | year = 1998[/tpl] "Tim Collings' creation holds promise in the future of the television industry, and the more exposure achieved, the more nations are able to benefit." Discussions took place about the increasing amount of violence on TV and the importance of monitoring and blocking shows. This sparked interest, but no steps were taken for implementation. In 1994 the technology was presented at a Violence on TV conference in France and later again at a conference in Belgium. This is where Al Gore first became familiarized with the concept of the V-Chip and the exposure helped him to advise Bill Clinton which led to the decision to pass the Telecommunications Act of 1996.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2204057/A-Brief-History-of-Collings-V-chip-Invention | title = A Brief History of Colling's V-Chip Invention | accessdate = 2010-05-27[/tpl]  Once the V-Chip gained the ability to block multiple shows at the same time interest in the technology expanded significantly. In January 1998 exclusive rights to the V-Chip were sold to Tri-Vision Electronics Inc.[tpl]cite journal | title = Tri-Vision Moves to Next Level in Roll-out of Its V-Chip Product Line in North America. | journal = Business Wire | date = 1998-01-26| id = | accessdate = 2010-05-27[/tpl]

==Forces leading to development==

===Scientific-technical===

After being inspired to make a change in the violent programming available to youth, Oregon engineer John Jackson developed the V-chip. Jackson conducted an independent study in, Southern Oregon, to determine the effects of television on violence. The Canadian Radio-Television Commission also conducted studies to determine the possible effects of television on violence. A link was indeed found[tpl]by whom|date=February 2012[/tpl] between violence and television and the v-chip gained popularity when it was revealed at a Technology Exposition at the G7 meetings in Brussels in 1995.

===Political===

One of the driving forces of the development of the V-chip was the signing of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 by President Bill Clinton. The television industry was given the opportunity to establish ratings for its programming. The act also ordered that half of all television sets at least 13 in. after July 1, 1999 had to have the V-chip installed and that all television sets at least 13 in. sets after January 1, 2000 had to have it installed. In addition, the Federal Communications Commission supported the act and worked to enforce it.

===Social===

Another force was public concern with acts of violence being committed by young people.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] After repeated school shootings, societies[tpl]which|date=July 2012[/tpl] were looking to find out why such tragedies were occurring. The V-chip created a heightened awareness of television content and broadcasters were held accountable for what was being aired.

==The Telecommunications Act==

The V-chip was an added provision in Bill Clinton's Telecommunications Act of 1996. He said, "If every parent uses this chip wisely, it can become a powerful voice against teen violence, teen pregnancy, teen drug use, and for both learning and entertainment," as he signed the law on February 8, 1996. "We're handing the TV remote control back to America's parents so that they can pass on their values and protect their children." The addition of the V-chip into the Telecommunications Act was helpful to attract American voters for the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.
The portion of the overall act that affects the V-chip is of Title V.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.lectlaw.com/files/stf05.htm | title = Telecommunications Act of 1996, Title V: Obscenity and Violence | accessdate = 2010-05-27[/tpl] This section, "Obscenity and Violence," addresses the influence parents may have over their children's viewing capabilities on cable television. Section 551, Parental Choice in Television Programming, outlines the effects that violence has on the youth of a nation and addresses how parents should exercise the control to limit and/or block what information their children are in fact viewing and what is being broadcast into their private homes. Also addressed is the inclusion of the implementation of a rating code for violence within television programming. Parents should be informed of the content of a program prior to its airing so that appropriate precautions may be made to protect their children from said material. The V-Chip technology would be employed in such an event

==Ratings==

In 1996, the United States Congress decreed that the television industry should create a voluntary rating system for its shows called the TV Parental Guidelines.FCC.gov Three main associations (the National Association of Broadcasters, the National Cable Television Association, and the Motion Picture Association of America) would establish this rating system. Along with the three founding associations, the chairman of the FCC would select five members of the advocacy community to participate in establishing television ratings. Altogether the FCC chairman, six members from each broadcasting industry and the five non-industry members make up a total of 24 participants. These ratings are the icons that appear in the corner of the television screen at the beginning of every show and after each commercial break for many broadcasters. These ratings include TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-Y7-FV, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, and TV-MA.
TV-Y includes all television programs designed to be appropriate for all children. TV-Y7 programs are directed to older children, specifically aged 7 and above. TV-Y7-FV programs are also directed to older children aged 7 and above with the addition that this rating denotes fantasy or animated violence. TV-G includes programs appropriate for all ages because it contains little to no violence, no strong language, and little to no sexual situations. TV-PG programs may include materials that parents may find unsuitable, including moderate violence, some sexual situations, or infrequent coarse language. TV-14 programs have parents strongly cautioned for materials unsuitable for children under 14 years of age. Finally, TV-MA programs are specifically designed to be viewed by adults aged 17 and up.

==Invention and patent==

===Invention===

Tim Collings states he developed the V-chip technology while he was an engineering professor at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia; however, he did not obtain a patent on the technology.

===Patent===

An idea for blocking programs in this way was patented by Brett West and John P. Gardner in 1994 and tested in Canada. The patent was number 5,550,575. Two others separately patented devices similar or identical to the V-chip:  John Olivo of Parental Guide of Omaha, and an Air Force captain by the name of Carl Elam. Collings, Olivo, and Elam all claim to have invented the technology.
Although there is debate over who patented the V-chip, Wi-LAN of Ottawa is the current holder.Wi-lan.com

==Criticisms==

===Usage===

On April 25, 2007, the Federal Communications Commission released a report entitled In the Matter of Violent Television Programming And Its Impact On Children. The report discusses the low usage of V-chip technology. In its analysis, the report addresses the following studies:
According to a 2003 study, parents' low level of V-chip use is explained in part by their unawareness of the device and the "multi-step and often confusing process" necessary to use it. Only 27% of all parents in the study group could figure out how to program the V-chip, and many parents "who might otherwise have used the V-Chip were frustrated by an inability to get it to work properly."
The Kaiser Family Foundation conducted a telephone survey in 2004 of 1,001 parents of children ages 2–17. The results of that survey showed:
A March 2007 Zogby poll indicated, among other things, that 88% of respondents did not use a V-chip or cable box parental controls in the previous week, leading the Parents Television Council to call the
television industry's V-chip education campaign a failure."In the Matter of Violent Television Programming and Its Impact on Children," MB Docket No., 04-261, Federal Communications Commission (April 25, 2007), Page 14 However this poll did not measure whether parents were aware of the V-chip and chose not to use it.
The networks feared that a single profanity would block an entire program. They also feared that they would lose advertising revenue because advertisers would not pay for time slots during programs that might be blocked.Price, M. E. (1998). The V-Chip Debate Content Filtering From TV to the Internet. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.

===Lack of supporting research===

The American Civil Liberties Union argues, "Research has not proven that watching violence on television causes watchers to commit violence" citing the Federal Trade Commission's Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children: A Review of the Self-Regulation and Industry Practices in the Motion Picture, Music Recording, & Electronic Game Industries report in September 2001 as support. In ACLU's website, ACLU quoted the FTC in saying, "Most researchers and investigators agree that exposure to media violence alone does not cause a child to commit a violent act, and that it is not the sole, or even the most important, factor in contributing to youth aggression, anti-social attitudes, and violence."American Civil Liberties Union. (2004, September 15). ACLU Comments to the Federal Communications Commission re: MB Docket No. 04-261, the Matter of Violent Television Programming and Its Impact on Children. Retrieved February 12, 2008, from aclu.org
According to J.M. Balkin, author of Media Filters and the V-Chip, people "want to filter out dangerous ideas and views they do not agree with or expressions that offend and anger them."Balkin, J. M. (1998). Media Filters and the V-Chip. Retrieved February 12, 2008, from Yale University Website yale.edu There is also cultural and familial differences; an action, activity, or behavior may be deemed as "appropriate" for one culture or for one family but may very well be considered "inappropriate" for another culture or for another family. Balkin says some people believe that the use of the V-chip is a way for the government to "intervene and impose binding moral standards" on others.

===Expenses===

While the V-chip is fairly inexpensive to add to individual television sets, a large amount of money has been spent educating people on the technology. $550 million was spent to educate parents on the V-chip, but they are no more aware of the technology or the ways in which it can be put to use now than they were before the funds were spent.[ref]

===Infringement on rights===

Many people[tpl]who|date=January 2013[/tpl] argue that it is not the government's right to monitor or censor what viewers watch on television. According to this argument, because the government regulates the rating system, it is also regulating much of parents' decision making processes on their children's viewing habits. Caroline Fredrickson, of the American Civil Liberties Union, stated, "These FCC recommendations are political pandering. The government should not replace parents as decision makers in America's living rooms. There are some things that the government does well. But deciding what is aired and when on television is not one of them."[ref]

===Insufficient number of users===

Despite the amount that has been spent on educating parents on use of the V-chip, there is still a low proportion of users. Of parents who have access to the V-chip, just 15% actually use it. As reported in 2007, 39% of parents who had access to the V-chip were unaware of its existence, and 20% of parents who knew of the V-chip's existence opted not to try it.[ref]
