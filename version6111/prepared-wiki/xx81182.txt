==Professional career==

In the early 19th century, the family business of William Banting of St. James’s Street, London, was among the most eminent companies of funeral directors in Britain. As funeral directors to the Royal Household, the Banting family conducted the funerals of King George III in 1820, King George IV in 1830, the Duke of Gloucester in 1834, the Duke of Wellington in 1852, Prince Albert in 1861, Prince Leopold in 1884, Queen Victoria in 1901, and King Edward VII in 1910. The royal undertaking warrant for the Banting family eventually ended in 1928 with the retirement of William Westport Banting.Todd Van Beck, "The Death and State Funeral of Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill", part II, in Canadian Funeral News (October 2012), Vol. 40 Issue 10, p. 10  (online)

===Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public===

In 1863, Banting wrote a booklet called Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public which contained the particular plan for the diet he followed. It was written as an open letter in the form of a personal testimonial. Banting accounted all of his unsuccessful fasts, diets, spa and exercise regimes in his past, then described the dietary change which finally had worked for him, following the advice of a physician. His own diet was four meals per day, consisting of meat, greens, fruits, and dry wine. The emphasis was on avoiding sugar, saccharine matter, starch, beer, milk and butter. Banting’s pamphlet was popular for years to come, and would be used as a model for modern diets.[ref]
</ref> Initially, he published the booklet at his personal expense. The self-published edition was so popular that he determined to sell it to the general public. The third and later editions were published by Harrison, London. The pamphlet's popularity was such that the question "do you bant?" referred to his method, and eventually to dieting in general.<ref name=Groves/>  Banting's booklet remains in print as of 2007.<ref name=Cosimo>

===Modern view===

Banting was publicly vilified for advancing a low-carbohydrate diet and false rumours were spread, claiming his diet had destroyed his health.[ref]
</ref>
Banting's work influenced contemporary physicians and scientists investigating low-carb diets. The attacks on Banting prefigured similar rumours spread about Robert Atkins, and the Atkins Foundation maintains Banting's works on its website.
Gary Taubes' recent study of carbohydrates, Good Calories, Bad Calories, begins with a prologue entitled "A brief history of Banting" and discusses Banting at some length.
Discussions of low-carbohydrate diets often begin with a discussion of Banting.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Astrup A, Meinert Larsen T, Harper A |title=Atkins and other low-carbohydrate diets: hoax or an effective tool for weight loss? |journal=Lancet |volume=364 |issue=9437 |pages=897–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15351198 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16986-9 |accessdate=2 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|author=Bliss M |title=Resurrections in Toronto: the emergence of insulin |journal=Horm.
