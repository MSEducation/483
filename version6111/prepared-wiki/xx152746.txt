Michał Dymitr Tadeusz Krajewski (8 September 1746 – 5 July 1817), sometimes also referred to as Dymitr M. Krajewski, was a Polish writer and educational activist of the times of the Enlightenment in Poland. His 1784 book Podolanka became the most debated and published Polish novel of that year, and his next book, Wojciech Zdarzyński, is considered to be the first Polish science-fiction novel.

Krajewski's writings concentrated on social issues and political debate about the need to reform the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (along the lines suggested by Jean-Jacques Rousseau). He was the supporter of the reformists idea, especially in the area of the education (like the reforms of the Commission of National Education, first ministry of education in the world).
His first book published in 1784 was the Podolanka wychowana w stanie natury, życie i przypadki swoje opisująca (The Podolian Girl: raised in the natural state, describing her life and events), inspired by French book by Henri Joseph Du Laurens (Imirce, ou la fille de la nature). The main hero, a female, criticizes humanity's efforts to destroy and subordinate nature. Podolanka initiated the first literary debate in PolandJan Ij. “van der” Meer, Literary Activities and Attitudes in the Stanislavian Age in Poland (1764-1795): a social system?, Rodopi, 2002, ISBN 90-420-0933-0, Google Print, p.25 and p.114 and had seven editions in one year.Jan Ij. “van der” Meer, Literary Activities and Attitudes in the Stanislavian Age in Poland (1764-1795): a social system?, Rodopi, 2002, ISBN 90-420-0933-0, Google Print, p.63
In 1785 he published another book, the Wojciech Zdarzyński życie i przypadki swoje opisujący (Wojciech Zdarzynski - life and adventures of himself describing) - about the adventures of a young Pole who uses a balloon to visit a utopian country on the Moon. The book is considered the first Polish science-fiction book.Seria autorska Polonistyki Uniwersytety Warszawskiego (Author series of Polish literature studies at University of Warsaw.
