In modern French "pendant" is the gerund form of “hanging” (also meaning “during”).
One of the earliest types of bodily adornment is the pendant. Primeval man liked to put a tiny hole in a beautiful rock and slip a string usually made of grass or vine so it could be hung around the neck. Shells and other indigenous materials could also be used. In Ancient Egypt, Pharaohs normally wore scarab beetle pendants to symbolize their wealth and power. Royalty and nobility in Egypt also wear a certain type of pendant called a cartouche.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.talismanamulet.org/2012/08/the-early-pendant-jewelry-and-talisman.html |title=The Early Pendant: A Jewelry And A Talisman|publisher=Talismanamulet.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07[/tpl]
Pendants can have several functions, which may be combined:
The many specialized types of pendants include lockets which open, often to reveal an image, and pendilia, which hang from larger objects of metalwork.
