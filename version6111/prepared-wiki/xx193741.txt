Don't Fight the Feelin' is the second studio album by American rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, released September 13, 1994 on Chrysalis Records and Rag Top Records.

==Track listing==

Only the first pressing of this album contained the original version of "I'll Be Around" which is not available on the single or any other album. All subsequent pressings of this album contained a remixed version of "I'll Be Around" with a running time of 5:47. The most obvious difference between the original version and the remix is that in the remix the music starts at the very beginning during the phone call, in the original the music doesn't start until after the phone call intro.

==Samples==

The song "She's A Sell Out" has the lyrics, "You can't trust a big butt and a smile" repeated many times in the background; these lyrics are originally from Boogie Down Productions, Jimmy on "By All Means Necessary". These lyrics are also used in Bell Biv Devoe song  "Poison" (1990) and also used in the Ice Cube song "Look Who's Burnin'" from the album Death Certificate. "She's A Sell Out" also heavily samples Too Short's song "Don't Fight the Feelin'" on Life Is...Too Short which is where Rappin 4-Tay made his mainstream debut[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/rappin-4-tay |title=Rappin' 4-Tay: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date=1968-03-02 |accessdate=2012-01-10[/tpl] and where this album gets its title.
