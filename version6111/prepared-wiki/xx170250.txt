RD1 or 0140+326 RD1 is a distant galaxy, it once held the title of most distant galaxy known.Astronomy Picture of the Day, A Baby Galaxy, March 24, 1998 RD1 was discovered in March 1998, and is at z = 5.34,arXiv, [tpl]PDF|1=A Galaxy at z = 5.34|2=209Â KB[/tpl], 11 March 1998 and was the first object found to exceed redshift 5.New York Times, Peering Back in Time, Astronomers Glimpse Galaxies Aborning, October 20, 1998 It bested the previous recordholders, a pair of galaxies at z=4.92 lensed by the galaxy cluster CL 1358+62 (CL 1358+62 G1 & CL 1358+62 G2). It was the most distant object known to mankind for a few months in 1998, until BR1202-0725 LAE was discovered at z = 5.64.

==Distance measurements==

The "distance" of a far away galaxy depends on what distance measurement you use.  With a redshift of 5.34, light from this galaxy is estimated to have taken around 12.5 billion years to reach us.[tpl]cite web |title=Cosmology Calculator I |publisher=Astronomy @ UCLA |author=Edward L. (Ned) Wright |url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html |accessdate=2010-10-22[/tpl]  But since this galaxy is receding from Earth, the present comoving distance is estimated to be around 26 billion light-years.
