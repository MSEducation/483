Boy Krazy is the self-titled debut of girl group Boy Krazy. This was the only album the group made. It was produced by Mike Stock and Pete Waterman, except "That's What Love Can Do" and "Good Times With Bad Boys", which are a Stock Aitken & Waterman production. Each member sings the lead vocals on at least two songs on the album. The album includes many tracks originally written for Kylie Minogue had Minogue stayed Stock Aitken & Waterman's PWL label.
The album includes their biggest hit "That's What Love Can Do", as well as the singles "All You Have to Do" and "Good Times With Bad Boys". A planned fourth single, "Love is a Freaky Thing", was never released as Johnna Cummings left the band in late 1993.
The album was released in North America first, and then through Europe and Asia. The American releases feature a guitar-driven version of the album track "On a Wing and a Prayer", whereas the European and Asian releases feature a mix more similar to Stock, Aitken & Waterman's typical Europop. Two of the tracks on the album, "That Kinda Love" and "Love Is A Freaky Thing", had been previously recorded by R&B group The Cool Notes, who worked with Stock & Waterman in 1991, but their versions were never released at the time. The latter was released through iTunes in 2009.
In August 2009, Boy Krazy's back catalogue was reissued through iTunes, including three songs recorded for the album but never released: "Exception to the Rule", "I'll Never Get Another Chance Like This", and "Don't Wanna Let You Go". Also issued were a host of unreleased remixes, including commissioned mixes for the never released fourth single "Love is a Freaky Thing".
