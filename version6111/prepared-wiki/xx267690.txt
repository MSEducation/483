==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career===

A former amateur wrestler, Frank Stiletto made his pro debut in 1992. Calling himself the "most handsome man in professional wrestling", hence his nickname "Handsome Frank", Stiletto often claimed to be a look-alike for country music star Billy Ray Cyrus."The PWI 500." Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (Holiday 1998): pg. 60. After nearly two years on the local independent circuit, he won his first major singles title in Mike Collins and Charlie Fulton's All-Star Wrestling Alliance by pinning then ASWA Light Heavyweight Champion Kid Collins at the ASWA supercard "Rumble On The River" in Belpre, Ohio, on August 12, 1994. He lost the title back to Collins a month later at the Dallas Nightclub in Parkersburg, West Virginia. That same month, Stalletto also made his first appearance in the World Wrestling Federation, now known as WWE, as a preliminary wrestler. He wrestled Jim Neidhart at the Civic Center in Wheeling, West Virginia and, in front of 2,800 fans, Yokozuna at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; these matches later aired on WWF Superstars[tpl]cite video | date=August 27, 1994 | url=http://www.tctapes.net/supr1994.htm | title= 08/27/1994 SUPERSTARS | medium=VHS | location=Wheeling, West Virginia | publisher=TCTapes.net[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.coreystapes.com/superstars94.html |title=1994 |work=WWF Superstars |publisher=Coreystapes.com |accessdate=July 29, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pwchronicles.com/links/wwwfe/tv/Superstars/94.htm |title=1994 |work=WWF Superstars of Wrestling (9/6/86 – 2001) |publisher=PWChronicles.com |accessdate=July 29, 2011[/tpl] and WWF Wrestling Challenge respectively.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wwfchamps.com/results.php?results=194 |title=1994 WWF Ring Results |work=Yearly Results |publisher=WWFChamps.com |accessdate=July 29, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm |title=1994 |author=Cawthon, Graham |work=Yearly Results |publisher=TheHistoryofWWE.com |accessdate=May 24, 2010[/tpl]

===Steel City Wrestling (1994–1998)===

The following month, Stiletto began wrestling for promoter Norm Connors in Steel City Wrestling where he would eventually become one of its top stars; he appeared on its first show against "Beef Stew" Lou Marconi in Connellsville, Pennsylvania on October 8, 1994.[tpl]cite video | people=Steel City Wrestling (Producer) | date=October 8, 1994 | url=http://saturnvideo.4t.com/catalog5.html | title=Tape No. 475 – Steel City Wrestling (10-8-94) | medium=VHS | location=Connellsville, Pennsylvania | publisher=Saturn Video[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://carnagechronicles.wordpress.com/2010/02/03/iwc-fallout-results/ |title=IWC "Fallout" Results |author=Stratoti, Paul |date=February 3, 2010 |work=Results |publisher=CarnageChronicles.com |accessdate=July 29, 2011[/tpl] Two weeks earlier, he teamed with Futureshock as "Beauty & The Beast" to wrestle Marconi & Derek Stone in Munhall, Pennsylvania to determine the first SCW Tag Team Champions; the bout took place at a show for American Commonwealth Wrestling and the match was not billed as a title bout by the rival promotion. Despite their loss, Beauty & The Beast won the titles in Pittsburgh less than three months later. The team eventually lost the titles to Marconi and his new partner Black Cat, dubbed "Black & Blue", in Plum, Pennsylvania on March 17, 1995; the title changed hands in separate singles matches with Futureshock defeating Marconi but Stiletto losing to Black Cat. A month later, he faced Super Mario at SCW's annual Deaf Wrestlefest, a special fundraising event for the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf which also included independent wrestlers Demolition Ax, Lord Zoltan and T. Ranchula, World Championship Wrestling's Cactus Jack, and the World Wrestling Federation's Big Bully Busick,[tpl]cite video | people=Steel City Wrestling (Producer) | date=May 15, 2003 | url=http://masterzofmayhem.tripod.com/indies.html | title=STEEL CITY WRESTLING 4/9/95 Pittsburgh School of the Deaf | medium=VHS | location=Edgewood, Pennsylvania | publisher=MasterzOfMayhem.com[/tpl] and would continue to perform at the shows over the next decade.
The following month, he made an appearance for Al Snow's Global Wrestling Alliance to wrestle Osamu Nishimura, during his debut tour of the United States, in Kalamazoo, Michigan on May 19, 1995.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/indy/gwa/gwacards.html#051995 |title=1995: 5/19 |work=Global Wrestling Alliance Cards |publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com |accessdate=July 29, 2011[/tpl] In July 1995, he teamed with longtime rival Lou Marconi in All-Star Wrestling Alliance to win the promotion's tag team titles.
Later that year, he enjoyed a brief partnership with Extreme Championship Wrestling's Stevie Richards and regained the SCW Tag Team titles from "Black & Blue" in Connellsville on October 21, however, he was attacked by Richards immediately after winning the belts. With the titles held up due to the team's breakup, Stiletto joined together with Lou Marconi to defeat Richards and Brian Rollins for the titles in St. Marys, Pennsylvania on November 11, 1995, a record third time. They dropped the titles back to Stevie Richards and The Blue Meanie"The PWI 500." Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (Winter 1996): pg. 46. at Deaf Wrestlefest 1996 on April 21, 1996.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gerweck.net/2009/10/19/dr-stevie/ |title=Stevie Richards |date=October 19, 2009 |publisher=Gerweck.net |accessdate=July 29, 2011[/tpl] Over the summer, the two appeared on the August 25 edition of WWF Action Zone against The Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart Gunn).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pwchronicles.com/links/wwwfe/tv/azone.htm |title=WWF Action Zone |work=WWWF / WWF / WWE Television Programming |publisher=PWChronicles.com |accessdate=July 29, 2011[/tpl]
In September 1996, he had a series of matches with Cody Michaels wrestling him in Buckhannon, West Virginia, Dover, Ohio and Mt. Washington, Pennsylvania on three consecutive nights; his second match with Michaels was an outdoor event held in the rain and attended by 4,800 fans. Stalletto and Marconi would continue battling the duo until the tag titles were declared vacant in January 1998 due to an injury suffered by Richards. Stiletto and Marconi made one last attempt to regain the titles but lost to Cactus Jack and The Blue Meanie in Irwin, Pennsylvania on February 8, 1998.

===International Pro Wrestling (1996–1998)===

While still in SCW, Stalletto also began feuding with Brick Bronsky in American Commonwealth Wrestling and International Pro Wrestling after Stiletto was attacked by Bronsky after being persuaded to tag with him. After Bronsky won the IPW Heavyweight Championship, Stiletto was among one of several independent wrestlers to challenge for the title.[tpl]cite news |title=Pro Matmen On Tap At Lehighton Bam Bam Bigelow To Face 911 In Feature Bout On March 22. |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1996-03-14/sports/3074101_1_wrestling-bam-public-enemy |newspaper=The Morning Call |date=March 14, 1996 |accessdate=July 5, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Pro Mat Action At Flagstaff Hall * 7:30 pm Start For Ipw Wrestlers, Including East Debut Of John Rambo. |newspaper=The Morning Call |date=June 26, 1997 |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1997-06-26/sports/3140145_1_bam-john-rambo-kevin-sullivan |accessdate=May 4, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite video | people=International Pro Wrestling (Producer) | date=June 27, 1997 | url=http://www.tctapes.net/ipw.htm | title= 06/27/1997 IPW: JIM THORPE, PA (266) | medium=VHS | location=Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania | publisher=TCTapes.net[/tpl] Despite losing the SCW Tag Team titles, Stiletto also continued to team with Lou Marconi wrestling in both Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as becoming a top contender for the ACW Heavyweight Championship.
