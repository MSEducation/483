==Setting==

Fair City is set in Carrigstown, a fictional suburb of Northside Dublin. Many of the scenes take place around the main street in Carrigstown, with notable landmarks on the street including McCoy's pub, Phelan's corner shop (now Spar, formerly Doyle's), The Hungry Pig (formerly The Bistro), the Community Centre (formerly The Haven) and Vino's (formerly Rainbows Sandwich Bar). Other notable settings include the Acorn Cabs dispatch centre, the shared office, the Helping Hand charity shop, the surgery and most recently The Station. 
According to the RTÉ Guide, Carrigstown is bounded by Drumcondra to the north, the city centre to the south, East Wall to the east and Phibsboro to the west.RTÉ  Guide, 5 - 11 September 2009 editionCarrigstown takes its name from the village that grew up around the quarries in which granite was mined until the early 20th century - carrig being the Irish word for rock.Gallagher, Brian (2005). Inside Fair City. Page 76. Rooney Media Graphics
Fair City occasionally makes use of real Dublin locations. Sequences have been shot in the Natural History Museum, on Grafton Street, during the Dublin City Marathon, and, more recently the Zoo and on the Luas, as well as at the National Ploughing Championships.

==Characters==

The series was originally focused on four families: the O'Hanlons, the Kellys, the Clarkes and the Doyles.  Some of the earlier characters also included Lily Corcoran, her womanizing nephew, Jack Flynn, Paul Brennan, who worked for Jack Flynn, and Linda O'Malley, an acquaintance of a Jack's, to whom he had promised fame as a singer. This was similar to the British soap EastEnders, which also originally focused on a number of families and the community in which they lived. Over time the emphasis has moved away from the four families and grown to include the wider community of Carrigstown.Product Description (Fair City: 20 Years in Carrigstown DVD).
During the 1990s the Phelan, Doyle, and Molloy families were introduced and dominated storylines for that decade. Bela and Rita Doyle, along with their brood of five children and Rita's mother Hannah, were involved in many stories. The Phelan family originally consisted of Hughie and Natalie, but later a new branch of the family arrived including Hughie's mother Eunice, and his brother Christy, along with Christy's wife Renee, and their two children Floyd and Farrah. The Molloy family was introduced in the mid-1990s and consisted of patriarch Harry, his wife Dolores, and their two teenage children Wayne and Lorraine.
The Halpin family was gradually introduced in the early 2000s, but since then the show's focus has shifted to individual characters more than family groupings. Notable characters introduced subsequently include Carol Meehan, Tracey Kavanagh, Ray O'Connell, and Jo Fahey. Another change in recent years has been the introduction of ethnic minority characters such as Lana Dowling (née Borodin) and the Udenze family. However, the Udenzes moved back to England after the father Gabriel was burnt to death in a fire, and Lana Dowling was kidnapped and murdered. In 2009 an Israeli character was introduced to the show – Avi Bar Lev (Asaf B. Goldfrid). Avi hails from the town of Haifa in Israel.
2012  brought the additions of the Dillon family – Father Tommy, Mother Judith three daughters Caoimhe Dillon, Neasa Dillon and Dearbhla Dillon, and son Zak.http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/new-family-moves-in-to-carrigstown-26676549.html The Bishops arrived in 2009, consisting of mother Vivienne, her sons Decco, Denzo and Zumo and daughter Charlotte. Vivienne's niece Sasha Bishop was introduced in 2012 and Father Paddy Bishop in 2013.
Charlie Kelly and Paul Brennan are the only original characters currently in the show.
Former executive producer Niall Mathews believes the soap's success is due to the large cast and the fact that no single character or group of characters dominates. "Difficulties are inherent if you are dealing with just one family", he says. "Look at Dallas and Dynasty; both did well at the beginning, but because all the action was centred on a single family, the writers ran out of things to say.""http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/why-its-success-in-the-city--for-rtes-soap-319178.html" Irish Independent.

==Production==

Each week rehearsals for the four episodes take place on Saturday and Monday. Shooting takes place on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the interior scenes are filmed at Studios A and C on RTÉ's Montrose  campus. The exterior scenes are filmed on the lot within the grounds of the RTÉ Headquarters on Thursday and on location on Friday.Gallagher, Brian (2005). Inside Fair City. Page 96. Rooney Media Graphics Scripts are prepared up to six months in advance, and episodes are shot six weeks before being aired.http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/my-pint-in-the-fair-city-local-25894969.htmlThe series is planned in various stages. The first stage is the development of story and plot, which is done by a team of writers. Once the stories have been fleshed out and agreed, a scene breakdown is created. The episodes are then assigned to script writers, who create the dialogue and stage directions for the actors.Gallagher, Brian (2005). Inside Fair City. Pages 30-33. Rooney Media Graphics
Running in parallel with the writing process is the production process, which includes: casting, wardrobe, make-up, design and construction of sets, purchase of props, finding locations, booking facilities, developing schedules, and other administrative tasks involved in managing a large production. From 1989 until 1994, all interior shots were filmed at Ardmore Studios, near Bray, County Wicklow. In 1994, production moved to studios at Montrose specifically adapted to cater for this flagship drama. All exterior shots were initially filmed at real houses in a real cul-de-sac in Barron Place,  Drumcondra and later in Booterstown.Gallagher, Brian (2005). Inside Fair City. Page 108. Rooney Media GraphicsIn 1991, a street set, known as the lot, was built at Ardmore. In 1994, the present lot was built at RTE.Tom Jordan (2009).1989-1994 chapter (Fair City: 20 Years in Carrigstown DVD).
The show has had four different opening sequences and four different theme songs. The opening features several scenes of contemporary Dublin, while the closing credits show a frozen image of the River Liffey.

===Theme tune===

Fair City's original theme tune was composed by Adam Lynch and Hugh Drumm. They were asked to come up with a piece of music that would be "easy on the ear, have a certain warmth, conjure up a feeling of Dublin and manage to reflect the mood of the programme."Gallagher, Brian (2005). Inside Fair City. Page 102. Rooney Media Graphics.The second theme tune was introduced in 1995, the third in 2005 and the fourth in 2008. The 1995 theme is an orchestral version of the original. The 2005 theme is an upbeat piano version of the 1995 one. The present theme, composed by Columb Farrelley and Andy O'Callaghan, is a jazzed up version of the original.

===Imagery===

The second opening sequence was introduced in 1995 when the then executive producer John Lynch decided that the opening needed modernising. It was designed  by John Hayes in collaboration with John Lynch. For 10 years, the opening remained unchanged, aside from the digital insertion of the Millennium Bridge. In order to be compatible with wide-screen format and show the changing face of Dublin, a new opening, designed by Michael McKeon, was introduced in 2005.Gallagher, Brian (2005). Inside Fair City. Pages 122-123. Rooney Media Graphics.The present opening, designed by Paul Gibney, was introduced in 2008.

==History==

===Concept and inspiration===

Fair City was conceived in 1988 by RTÉ when it decided that it needed an urban soap opera to compete with Coronation Street and EastEnders.Gallagher, Brian (2005). Inside Fair City. Page 12. Rooney Media Graphics."http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/wanderer-wayne-jets-home-to-fair-city-1886548.html" Evening Herald. URL last. Retrieved 4 November 2009. Margaret Gleeson, known for her work on Tolka Row and The Riordans, was the show's first Executive Producer. Paul Cusack and David McKenna were the first producers. Tony Holland – co-creator of EastEnders – was brought  in to give the soap its structure and storylines for the first season.http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/dec/03/guardianobituaries.television
Fair City derives its title from the opening line of the traditional song "Molly Malone": "In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty..." and is the only English-language soap opera produced in Ireland. The show was launched with an hour-long pilot episode in September 1989 Gallagher, Brian (2005). Inside Fair City. Page 13. Rooney Media Graphics. and at the time was described as "the most ambitious production of its kind ever undertaken by RTÉ".The Irish Emigrant – 25 June 1989

===Early years===

Fair City was not an instant success and was on shaky ground for a couple of seasons. Former executive producer John Lynch recalled: "My impression of it at the time was of nothing happening very fast, then you'd cut to a scene where nothing happened even faster, then there would be a shot of somebody riding a bicycle stuck in between. They were trying to copy Eastenders, but Tony Holland didn't realise that the Irish are less direct than the English.""http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/alls-fair-in--love-and-war-1817102.html" Irish Independent. Retrieved 20 October 2009.
in 1990, RTE executives initially cancelled the show after the first season. However, they then decided to renew it for a second season and bring in Irish writer Mary Halpin in place of Tony Holland.
Tony Tormey, who plays Paul Brennan, explains: “He Holland just didn’t have the Irish thing. The scripts were all in a different idiom. They were written in Londonese rather than Dublinese. It just didn’t work so they cancelled it. But they stuck with it and brought Mary Halpin in. It was almost like starting again.”[tpl]cite news |date=2012-11-03 |title=The never ending story |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/media/the-never-ending-story-1.547249?page=1 |publisher=The Irish Times |archiveurl=http://archive.today/ATgXx |archivedate=2014-04-19 [/tpl]
The introduction of strong story lines centring around the Doyle and Molloy families in the early 1990s began to gradually improve the soap's popularity and were overseen by the new executive producer Niall Mathews, who was in charge from 1990 to 2008, apart from the period between 1994 and 1998.Gallagher, Brian (2005).
