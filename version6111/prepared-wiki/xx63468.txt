==Career==

===Rise to fame as model===

Macpherson enrolled to study law at Sydney University. Before beginning her university studies, she visited the United States to spend one year doing modelling work in order to earn money to pay for her law books.[tpl]cite web|title=Elle's Law|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/100702-elle-macphersons-wanted-to-be-a-la.aspx|last=Sowray|first=Bibby|date=2 July 2010|work=Vogue|accessdate=18 January 2011[/tpl] She traveled to New York City, where she initially signed up with Click Model Management. Her modeling career began in 1982 with a television commercial for Tab which established her as a "girl next door" figure in Australia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lifelounge.com/Elle-Macpherson-Tab-Commercial.aspx|title=Elle Macpherson Tab Commercial|publisher=Lifelounge|date=11 June 2007|accessdate=28 December 2011[/tpl] 
In 1986, Time magazine had already put her on the cover (with a feature entitled "The Big Elle") but by that time, she had also appeared on the covers of Cosmopolitan, Elle, GQ, Harper's Bazaar and Vogue.[tpl]cite web|title=Elle Macpherson|url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/models/Elle_Macpherson/|work=FashionModelDirectory.com|accessdate=4 February 2012[/tpl] She cemented her high profile through frequent appearances in Elle, where she appeared in every issue for six straight years. During that time, at the age of 21, she married Gilles Bensimon, the creative director of Elle.Evening Standard, 23 April 2004, pp. 30–33: "Before starting college, Elle went on a skiing trip to Aspen, Colorado. On the way home, she was persuaded by her Australian modelling booker to stop off in New York City to see if she could get some work. She stayed for 20 years, marrying the photographer Gilles Bensimon at 21. She was his muse, but the age difference ... proved to be too great, and they divorced six years later (1989)."

Eventually she garnered more exposure through Sports Illustrated magazine's annual Swimsuit Issue. She appeared on the cover a record five times: 1986, 1987, 1988, 1994, and 2006. Along with Naomi Campbell, she co-hosted  the Miss Universe 2001 pageant. Her popularity had reached such a level that Australian government offered her a position on its tourist commission as an unofficial ambassador.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nymag.com/fashion/models/emacpherson/ellemacpherson|title=Elle Macpherson – Fashion Model|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=23 September 2010[/tpl] 
After appearing nude in the 1994 film Sirens, Macpherson learned that the media had begun searching for nude photos of her, including contacting her ex-boyfriends. To address this, Macpherson appeared in a nude pictorial in the May 1994 issue of Playboy magazine, in order to produce nude photos "on her own terms".Marlowe, Rachel (28 November 2011). "'I did it my way': Supermodel Elle Macpherson bared it all for Playboy - but on her own terms". Mail Online.
Macpherson returned to the runway in 2010 to close the fall Louis Vuitton show for Marc Jacobs in Paris.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.look.co.uk/fashion/elle-macpherson-closes-the-louis-vuitton-2010-show|title=Elle Macpherson Closes The Louis Vuitton 2010 Show!|work=Look|accessdate=7 June 2012[/tpl]

===Business career===

In the 1980s, together with Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz, Naomi Campbell, Pavlína Pořízková, and Cindy Crawford, Macpherson became part of the new generation of supermodels. In 1989 she was given the nickname Elle "The Body" Macpherson by Time Magazine after she appeared on their cover. She went on to use the name in a number of business ventures.[tpl]cite news|title=Elle Macpherson: Unabashed Passion, Ageless Beauty & Creating the Next Fashion Star|first=Allison|last=Kugel|authorlink=Allison Kugel|url=http://www.pr.com/article/1195|publisher=PR.com|date=20 December 2011|accessdate=12 March 2012[/tpl]
In 1994, she left her agency, Ford Models, to form her own company, Elle Macpherson Inc., which would serve as the financial organizational base for her later endeavours.Daily Mail, Sunday You Magazine, 15 September 2002, pp. 28–33: "The Elle calendar became a worldwide hit, and a new version has been produced twice since, while her 1995 video, Your Personal Best Workout: The Body, was also a bestseller". She soon went on to produce her own highly popular series of calendars, each of which was accompanied by a "making of" television program in 1992, 1993, and 1994. She used this success as a springboard to create the "Your Personal Best – The Body" series of workout videos.
She later diversified her portfolio of businesses, and in 1990 launched her lingerie collection 'Elle Macpherson Intimates' in partnership with Bendon Limited Apparel. Intimates met with remarkable international success, becoming the single best-selling lingerie line in both Great BritainThe Sunday Times Business, 23 March 2008, p. 17: "Macpherson, supermodel-turned-lingerie queen, has made that her leitmotif. Elle Macpherson Intimates range is the biggest selling brand of fashion lingerie in Britain." and AustraliaTatler, July 2002, vol. 297, num. 7, pp. 98–107: "We’re going through Elle's underwear. This is what she does. She designs knickers and bras. She's very good at it, very successful. It makes her more money than modelling, and Elle has made a lot of money modeling."
The partnership was among the first instances of a crossover between a model and a fashion label. In 1989, when she was first approached by Bendon to promote their lingerie in Australia, Macpherson saw an opportunity to reverse their strategy and suggested a licensing arrangement, with products bearing her name and designs created in partnership with Bendon's team. Though commonplace now, the idea was unorthodox at the time.[tpl]cite news|author=Rebecca Gonsalves|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/a-head-for-business-and-a-body-for-lingerie-6275570.html|title=A head for business and a body for lingerie|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=12 December 2011|accessdate= 7 June 2012[/tpl]

The company credits her with the ideas for many products, including its successful maternity-bra line, which Macpherson designed while nursing her second child." Intimates has retained a high brand recognition into the 2000s, appearing as a featured brand on America's Next Top Model; last year, the brand celebrated 10 years of being stocked at Selfridges.
