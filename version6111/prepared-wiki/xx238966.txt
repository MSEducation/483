==Playing career==

He attended college at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, where he played college hockey for 3 years before starting his professional career. 
On February 1, 2011, he made his NHL debut in relief of Antti Niemi. Playing 29 minutes and 47 seconds, Stalock allowed no goals on nine shots to record his first NHL win in a 5-3 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes.[tpl]citeweb| url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2010020763 | title = Sharks rally to beat Coyotes 5-3 | publisher = National Hockey League | date = 2011-02-01 | accessdate = 2011-02-01[/tpl] Shortly after his debut he was reassigned to the Sharks minor league affiliate, Worcester Sharks. In a game against the Manchester Monarchs on February 4, he suffered a sliced nerve behind his knee after being stepped on by the skate of Manchester's Dwight King, sidelining him for the remainder of the 2010–11 season. Afterwards, he had surgery to repair the nerve and went through many months of rehabilitation.  Stalock was sidelined until January 21, 2012, when he started in goal for San Jose's ECHL affiliate, the Stockton Thunder.  After six games in Stockton, Stalock was called up to Worcester.[tpl]citeweb| url = http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/9686234/alex-stalock-back-san-jose-sharks-training-camp-batting-severe-injury-bad-luck | title = Stalock unbowed after adversity | publisher = ESPN | date = 2013-09-18 | accessdate = 2013-10-11[/tpl]
