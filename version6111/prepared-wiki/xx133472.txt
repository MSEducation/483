Ona (Aona), also known as Selk'nam (Shelknam), is a language that was once spoken by the Selknam people in Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego in southernmost South America.
Part of the Chonan languages of Patagonia, Selk'nam is now extinct, due both to the late 19th-century Selknam Genocide by European immigrants, high fatalities due to disease, and disruption of traditional society. The last native speakers died in the 1980s,Adelaar 2010, p. 92 but ethnic Selk'nam continue.
