[[Alternative wine closure]]

CATEGORIES: Wine packaging and storage

Alternative wine closures are substitute closures used in the wine industry for sealing wine bottles in place of traditional cork closures. The emergence of these alternatives has grown in response to quality control efforts by winemakers to protect against "cork taint" caused by the presence of the chemical trichloroanisole (TCA).Shriver, Jerry, USA Today (August 3, 2006). And now for something completely differentBusiness Wire (August 9, 2005). 'Just Say No' — To Cork! Don Sebastiani & Sons Announces Plans to Focus Exclusively on Alternative Wine Closures 
The closures debate, chiefly between supporters of screw caps and natural corks, has increased the awareness of post-bottling wine chemistry, and the concept of winemaking has grown to continue after the bottling process, because closures with different oxygen transmission rates may lead to wines that taste different when they reach consumers.[tpl]cite web|last= Goode |first= Jamie, Ph.D. Wines & Vines  |date= August 2008 |url= http://www.winesandvines.com/template.cfm?content=57269&section=features |title= Finding Closure[/tpl]
The cork-industry group APCOR cites a study showing a 0.7-1.2% taint rate. In a 2005 study of 2800 bottles tasted at the Wine Spectator blind-tasting facilities in Napa, California, 7% of the bottles were found to be tainted.Laube, James, Wine Spectator (March 31, 2006). Changing With the Times

==Synthetic corks==

Synthetic corks are made from plastic compounds  designed to look and "pop" like natural cork, but without the risk of TCA contamination. Disadvantages of some wine synthetic corks include a risk of harmful air entering a bottle after only 18 months, as well as the difficulty in extracting them from the bottle and using the plastic cork to reseal the wine.[tpl]cite web|last= Robinson |first= Jancis, jancisrobinson.com |title= Down with synthetic corks! |url= http://www.jancisrobinson.com/winenews/winenews060610| date= June 10, 2006 [/tpl] James Laube of Wine Spectator notes that some can also impart a slight chemical flavour to the wine. 
Unlike natural corks, many wine synthetic corks are made from material that is not biodegradable but recyclable as either #4 or #7 (see resin identification code) in many communities. There are two main production techniques for synthetic wine closures: injection molding and extrusion (mono- and co-). Methods also exist which are claimed to combine the two techniques of injection and extrusion. A 2007 study by Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2 University showed that injection molded synthetic corks allowed the highest levels of oxygen permeation in when compared to natural cork and screw caps, offering the lowest protection against oxidation of the wine.Kramer, Matt, Wine Spectator (October 31, 2007). Seeking Closure p. 36
A new generation of injection molded synthetic closures have developed a system of nano-cells as to replicate the cellular structure of natural cork, thereby duplicating their permeability values.Sole 24 Ore (September 10, 2008)

==Screw caps==

Screw caps or "Stelvin caps" are closures made only from aluminium material that threads onto the bottleneck. They are the predominant closure used by Australian and New Zealand wineries.Ciampa, Gail, The Providence Journal (August 2, 2006). Don't get caught without your wine notes This can be attributed in part to the New Zealand screw cap initiative which promotes the use of screw caps instead of cork.  Screw caps form a tighter seal and can keep out oxygen for a longer time than cork. These benefits aid in maintaining the wine's overall quality and aging potential. Michel Laroche of Domaine Laroche noted that this played a role in his decision to adopt screwcaps. "Extensive quality tests show convincing results: apart from protecting against cork taint, screwcaps are also beneficial in the aging of wine, particularly preserving the aromatic freshness."South African Wine News (July 26, 2006). The Winery goes out to bat for screwcaps 
An often cited contradiction is the case of experiments carried out by Château Haut-Brion in the 1970s, when 100 bottles were placed under screwcap for long term observation. The result was, according to Haut-Brion manager Jean-Bernard Delmas, that "it worked perfectly for the first ten years, until the plastic in the caps went brittle and let air in".[tpl]cite web|last= Lechmere |first= Adam, Decanter.com | title= Kiwis spread the screwcap gospel |url= http://www.decanter.com/news/46395.html |date= May 30, 2002 [/tpl]
A disadvantage of screw caps according to wine expert Jancis Robinson is the opposite of oxidation, reduction, which may suppress a wine's aroma and possibly cause unpleasant ones, a problem that particularly affects Sauvignon blanc which is a grape variety with natural tendencies toward reduction.[tpl]cite web|last= Robinson |first= Jancis, jancisrobinson.com |title= Will our grandchildren need a corkscrew? |url= http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/winenews0612 |date= June 11, 2004 [/tpl] Furthermore there is the screwcap's public image, as "consumers still perceive screwcaps as being for 'cheap' wines (regardless of the price tag)".[tpl]cite web|last= Robinson |first= Jancis, jancisrobinson.com |title=Zork talk |url= http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/winenews060629.html |date= June 29, 2006[/tpl]
In a 2004 study of consumer opinions conducted by the wine consulting firm Wine Intelligence found that nearly 52% of American consumers and 60% of British consumers reject the idea of using screwcaps for their fine wine.APCOR, realcork.org Wine Intelligence- Closures: The US Consumer View The 2007 Victor Segalen University study in Bordeaux showed that screw caps closures allowed the lowest amount of oxygen permeation when compared to natural and synthetic corks, offering the highest level of protection against oxidation of the wine.

==Vino-Seal and Vinolok==

Vino-Seal is a plastic/glass closure released by Alcoa. Since its introduction into the European market in 2003, over 300 wineries have utilized Vino-Seal. Using a glass stopper with an inert o-ring, the Vino-Seal creates a hermetic seal that prevents oxidation and TCA contamination. A disadvantage with the Vino-Seal is the relatively high cost of each plug (70 cents each) and cost of manual bottling due to the lack of compatible bottling equipment outside of Europe. Vinolok is a glass stopper developed and produced by a Czech crystal glass producer Preciosa. Perdue, Andy, Wine Press Northwest (Summer 2006). "Glass adds class to Oregon Wine"

==Zork==

Zork is an alternative wine closure for still wines, that seals like a screw cap and pops like a cork, created by an Australian company of the same name. The closure has three parts: an outer cap providing a tamper-evident clamp that locks onto the band of a standard cork mouth bottle; an inner metal foil which provides an oxygen barrier similar to a screw cap, and an inner plunger which creates the ‘pop’ on extraction and reseals after use. Introduced in 2010, it is the first on-bottle, resealable closure for sparkling wines.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

==Opposition==

There is continuing opposition to the use of alternative closures in some parts of the Winemaking industry. In March 2006, the Spanish government outlawed the use of alternative wine closures in 11 of Spain's wine producing regions as part of their (Denominacion de Origen) D.O. regulations.Business Wire (March 27, 2006). "Put a Cork in It" Says New Spanish Law; Spain's Top Wine Producers Outlaw Alternative Closures in 11 Spanish Regions
Although environmentalists lament the loss of cork forests to commercial crops such as eucalyptus, advocates of artificial corks claim that "natural corks" are just "granules and dust bonded with solvents", and no more biodegradable than the artificial product.BBC News (Sep. 18, 2008).
