St. Peter's congregation (Evangelisch Lutherischen St. Peters Gemeinde) was founded February 14, 1860 by German immigrants. The congregation is affiliated with the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS).  In 1884, 13 families were released from the congregation for the purposes of establishing Christ Evangelical Lutheran Church. 
The current church building was designed by architect Andrew Elleson in Italianate Gothic style and built in 1885. It features landmark spires of unequal height. An accompanying school building designed by architect John Rugee was constructed in 1879.
