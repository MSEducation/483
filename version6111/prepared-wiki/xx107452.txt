There were Bollywood offers but it was not until Sona’s script that made me look at India."[tpl]cite web|title=People want escapism by Mathures Paul |url=http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=341640&catid=47[/tpl] The film had a commercial release in September 2010.
