</ref>  In 1887 Cambodia was fully integrated into [[French Indochina]] which brought in a [[French language|French]]-speaking aristocracy. This led to French becoming the language of higher education and the intellectual class.  Many native scholars in the early 20th century, led by a monk named [[Chuon Nath]], resisted the French influence on their language and championed Khmerization, using Khmer roots (and Pali and Sanskrit) to coin new words for modern ideas, instead of French.<ref name=CBHP/> Nath cultivated modern Khmer-language identity and culture, overseeing the translation of the entire Pali Buddhist canon into Khmer and creating the modern Khmer language dictionary that is still in use today, thereby ensuring that Khmer would survive, and indeed flourish, during the French colonial period.<ref name=CBHP/>

==Phonology==

The phonological system described here is the inventory of sounds of the spoken language, not how they are written in the Khmer alphabet.Huffman, Franklin. 1970. Cambodian System of Writing and Beginning Reader. Yale University Press. ISBN 0-300-01314-0

===Consonants===

Khmer is frequently described as having aspirated stops. However, these may be analyzed as consonant clusters, [tpl]IPA|/ph, th, ch, kh/[/tpl], as infixes can occur between the stop and the aspiration (phem, p[tpl]angle bracket|an[/tpl]hem), or as non-distinctive phonetic detail in other consonant clusters, such as the khm in Khmer.[tpl]cite book|last=Minegishi|first=M|title=Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics|editor=Keith Brown|publisher=Elsevier|year=2006|edition=2|pages=4981–4984|chapter=Khmer[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|b[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|d[/tpl] are occasional allophones of the implosives.
In addition, the consonants [tpl]IPA|/f/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/ʃ/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/z/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ɡ/[/tpl] may occasionally occur in recent loan words in the speech of Cambodians familiar with French and other languages. These non-native sounds are not represented in the Khmer script, although combinations of letters otherwise unpronounceable are used to represent them when necessary. In the speech of those who are not bilingual, these sounds are approximated with natively occurring phonemes:

===Vowel nuclei===

Various researchers have proposed slightly different analyses of the vowels. This may be in part because political centralization has not yet been achieved, so standard Khmer does not prevail throughout Cambodia.  Additionally, the Cambodian Civil War resulted in massive internal population upheaval.  As such, many speakers of even the same community may have different phonological inventories.[tpl]cite web| url=http://repository.tufs.ac.jp/bitstream/10108/21736/1/jaas031010.pdf| title= On Takeo Dialects of Khmer: Phonology and World List| first=Makoto| last=Minegishi| year=1986| accessdate=2008-12-04[/tpl] Two proposals follow. The first is Huffman's analysis of Standard Khmer, and the second is Wayland's analysis of Battambang Khmer, the dialect upon which the standard is based.
The precise number and the phonetic value of vowel nuclei vary from dialect to dialect. Short and long vowels of equal quality are distinguished solely by duration.

===Syllable structure===

Khmer words are predominantly either monosyllabic or sesquisyllabic, with stress falling on the final syllable.[tpl]cite web| url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/schiller1994khmer.pdf | title= Khmer Nominalizing and Causitivizing Infixes| year=1994 | first=Eric| last= Schiller | publisher=University of Chicago| accessdate =2008-12-04[/tpl] There are two possible clusters of three consonants at the beginning of syllables, [tpl]IPA|/str skr/[/tpl],Phonetic and Phonological Analysis of Khmer and 85 possible two-consonant clusters:
Syllables begin with one of these consonants or consonant clusters, followed by one of the vowel nuclei. The aspiration in some clusters is allophonic.[tpl]cite book|last=Jacob|first=JM|title=Classical Civilizations of South-East Asia: Key Papers from SOAS|editor=VI Braginskiĭ|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|chapter=The Structure of the Word in Old Khmer[/tpl] When the vowel nucleus is short, there has to be a final consonant. [tpl]IPA|/p, t, c, k, ʔ, m, n, ɲ, ŋ, l, h, j, ʋ/[/tpl] can exist in a syllable coda, while [tpl]IPA|/h/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ʋ/[/tpl] approach [tpl]IPA|ç[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|w[/tpl] respectively.  The stops [tpl]IPA|/p, t, c, k/[/tpl] have no audible release when occurring as syllable finals.
The most common word structure in Khmer is a full syllable as described above, which may be preceded by an unstressed, "minor" syllable that has a consonant-vowel structure of CV-, CrV-, CVN- or CrVN- (N is any nasal in the Khmer inventory). The vowel in these preceding syllables is usually reduced in conversation to [tpl]IPA|ə[/tpl], however in careful or formal speech and in television and radio, they are always clearly articulated.
Words with three or more syllables exist, particularly those pertaining to science, the arts, and religion. However, these words are loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French.

===Suprasegmental features===

====Phonation and tone====

Khmer once had a phonation distinction in its vowels, which was indicated in writing by choosing between two sets of letters for the preceding consonant according to the historical source of the phonation. However, phonation has been lost in all but the most archaic dialect of Khmer (Western Khmer). For example, Old Khmer distinguished voiced and unvoiced pairs as in [tpl]IPA|*kaa[/tpl] vs [tpl]IPA|*ɡaa[/tpl]. The vowels after voiced consonants became breathy voiced and diphthongized: [tpl]IPA|*kaa, *ɡe̤a[/tpl]. When consonant voicing was lost, the distinction was maintained by the vowel: [tpl]IPA|*kaa, *ke̤a[/tpl], and later the phonation disappeared as well: [tpl]IPA|kaː, kiə[/tpl].
Although most Cambodian dialects are not tonal, colloquial Phnom Penh dialect has developed a tonal contrast (level versus peaking tone) to compensate for the elision of [tpl]IPA|/r/[/tpl].

====Prosody====

=====Stress=====

Stress in Khmer is non-phonemic (does not distinguish different meanings) and thus is considered to depend entirely on syllable structure.  Owing in part to the sesquisyllabic nature of Khmer, syllabic stress is also highly predictable.  In native disyllabic words, the first syllable is always a minor syllable and the second syllable is stressed. Loan words and reduplications also tend to follow this pattern:
|[tpl]lang|km|សំពត់[/tpl] ||[tpl]IPA|/sɑm ˈpoə̯̆t/[/tpl] ||"type of sarong"
|-
|[tpl]lang|km|អំបោះ[/tpl] ||[tpl]IPA|/ɑm ˈbɑːh/[/tpl] ||"thread"
|-
|[tpl]lang|km|ទូលាយ[/tpl] ||[tpl]IPA|/tuː ˈliə̯j/[/tpl] ||"spacious"
|}
In words of more than two syllables, primary stress is always on the final syllable with secondary stress on every second syllable. Thus, in a three-syllable word, the first syllable exhibits secondary stress, while primary stress is on the third syllable:
|[tpl]lang|km|រតនា[/tpl] ||[tpl]IPA|/ˌreə̯̆ʔ taʔ ˈnaː/[/tpl] ||"gem, jewel, precious stone"
|-
|[tpl]lang|km|រដ្ធបាល[/tpl] ||[tpl]IPA|/ˌroə̯̆t tʰaʔ ˈbaːl/[/tpl] ||"caretaker of the government"
|-
|[tpl]lang|km|កម្ពុជា[/tpl] ||[tpl]IPA|/ˌkam puʔ ˈciə̯/[/tpl] ||"Kampuchea"
|}
Compound words of three syllables, however, follow the stress of the constituent words:
|[tpl]lang|km|អំបិលម្ទេស[/tpl] ||[tpl]IPA|/ɑm ˌbɨl ˈmteːh/[/tpl] ||"a dry dipping powder of peppers and salt"
|-
|[tpl]lang|km|អន្ទាក់រូត[/tpl] ||[tpl]IPA|/ɑn ˌteə̯̆ʔ ˈruːt/[/tpl] ||"a snare"
|-
|[tpl]lang|km|សំបុកចាប[/tpl] ||[tpl]IPA|/sɑm ˌbok ˈcaːp/[/tpl] ||"a kind of cookie" (lit. "bird's nest")
|}
In a four-syllable word, the second syllable carries secondary stress and primary stress is on the fourth syllable:
|[tpl]lang|km|សីមារេខា[/tpl] ||[tpl]IPA|/səj ˌmaː reə̯̆ʔ ˈkʰaː/[/tpl] ||"boundary line"
|-
|[tpl]lang|km|សកម្មភាព[/tpl] ||[tpl]IPA|/saʔ ˌkam meə̯̆ʔ ˈpʰiə̯p/[/tpl] ||"physical activity"
|-
|[tpl]lang|km|រណូងរណាង[/tpl] ||[tpl]IPA|/rɔ ˌnoːŋ rɔ ˈnaːŋ/[/tpl] ||"hasty, hastily, angrily" (an example of reduplication)
|}
Words of five or more syllables are exceedingly rare in everyday conversation but do occur in academic, governmental, and religious contexts.  These words are all derived from Sanskrit or Pali roots but follow Khmer pronunciation and stress patterns:Headly, Robert K.; Chhor, Kylin; Lim, Lam Kheng; Kheang, Lim Hak; Chun, Chen. 1977. Cambodian-English Dictionary. Bureau of Special Research in Modern Languages. The Catholic University of America Press. Washington, D.C. ISBN 0-8132-0509-3
|[tpl]lang|km|មេឃវាហន[/tpl] ||[tpl]IPA|/meː ˌkʰeə̯̆ʔ viə̯ ˌhaʔ ˈnaʔ/[/tpl] ||"A name of Indra" (lit. from Sanskrit "having clouds for a vehicle")
|}

=====Intonation=====

As Khmer is primarily an analytic pro-drop language, intonation (non-phonemic pitch variation throughout clauses) often conveys semantic context. The intonation pattern of a typical Khmer declarative phrase is a steady rise throughout followed by an abrupt drop on the last syllable. 
|[tpl]lang|km|ខ្ញុំមិនចង់បានទេ[/tpl] || [tpl]IPA|/↗kʰɲom mɨn caŋ baːn  ↘teː/[/tpl] || "I don't want it."
|}
Other intonation contours signify a different type of phrase such as the "full doubt" interrogative, similar to "yes-no" questions in English or the exclamatory phrase.  Full doubt interrogatives remain fairly even in tone throughout but rise sharply towards the end.
|[tpl]lang|km|អ្នកចង់ទៅលេងសៀមរាបទេ[/tpl] || [tpl]IPA|/↗nea? caŋ  ↗tɨw leːŋ siəm riəp  ꜛteː/[/tpl] || "Do you want to go to Siem Reap?"
|}
Exclamatory phrases follow the typical steadily rising pattern, but rise sharply on the last syllable instead of falling.
|[tpl]lang|km|សៀវភៅនេះថ្លៃណាស់[/tpl] || [tpl]IPA|/↗siəw pʰɨw nih ↗tʰlaj  ꜛnahs/[/tpl] || "This book is expensive!"
|}

==Grammar==

Khmer is generally a subject–verb–object (SVO) language with prepositions.Huffman, Franklin. 1967. An outline of Cambodian Grammar. PhD thesis, Cornell University. Although primarily an analytic language, lexical derivation by means of prefixes and infixes occurs but is not always productive in the modern language.[tpl]cite book|title=Colloquial Cambodian: A Complete Language Course |author= David Smyth|year=1995|publisher=Routledge (UK)|isbn=0-415-10006-2[/tpl]

===Adjectives and Adverbs===

Adjectives, demonstratives and numerals follow the noun they modify.  Adverbs likewise follow the verb.  Morphologically, adjectives and adverbs are not distinguished with many words often serving either function. Similar to other languages of the region, intensity can be expressed by reduplication.Huffman, F. E., Promchan, C., & Lambert, C.-R. T. (1970). Modern spoken Cambodian. New Haven: Yale University Press. ISBN 0-300-01315-9
[tpl]lang|km|ស្រីស្អាតនោះ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|/srəj sʔaːt nuh/[/tpl] (girl pretty that) = that pretty girl

[tpl]lang|km|ស្រីស្អាតស្អាត[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|/srəj sʔaːt sʔaːt/[/tpl] (girl pretty pretty) = a very pretty girl
As Khmer sentences rarely use a copula, adjectives are also employed as verbs.  Comparatives are formed by the use of ciəng: "A X ciəng B" (A is more X than B).  The most common way to express the idea of superlatives is the construction "A X ciəng kee" (A is X-est of all).

===Nouns===

The noun has no grammatical gender or singular/plural distinction and is uninflected. Technically there are no articles, but indefiniteness is often expressed by the word for "one" following the noun.  Plurality can be marked by postnominal particles, numerals, or reduplicating the adjective, which, although similar to intensification, is usually not ambiguous due to context.
[tpl]lang|km|ឆ្កែធំ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|/cʰkae tʰom/[/tpl] (dog large) = large dog
[tpl]lang|km|ឆ្កែធំធំ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|/cʰkae tʰom tʰom/[/tpl] (dog large large) = a very large dog or large dogs
[tpl]lang|km|ឆ្កែធំណាស់[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|/cʰkae tʰom nah/[/tpl] (dog large very) = very large dog
[tpl]lang|km|ឆ្កែពីរ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|/cʰkae piː/[/tpl] (dog two) = two dogs
Classifying particles for use between numerals and nouns exist although are not always obligatory as in, for example, Thai.  Pronouns are subject to a complicated system of social register, the choice of pronoun depending on the perceived relationships between speaker, audience and referent (see Social registers below). Kinship terms, nicknames and proper names are often used as pronouns (including for the first person) among intimates. Frequently, subject pronouns are dropped in colloquial conversation.

===Verbs===

As is typical of most East Asian languages,East and Southeast Asian Languages: A First Look at Oxford University Press Online the verb does not inflect at all; tense and aspect can be shown by particles and adverbs or understood by context. Most commonly, time words such as "yesterday", "earlier", "tomorrow", indicate tense when not inferrable from context. There is no participle form. The gerund is formed by using [tpl]IPA|/kəmpɔːŋ/[/tpl]: "A [tpl]IPA|/kəmpɔːŋ/[/tpl] V" (A is in the process of V). Serial verb construction is quite common. Negation is achieved by putting [tpl]IPA|/min/[/tpl] before them and [tpl]IPA|/teː/[/tpl] at the end of the sentence or clause. In normal speech verbs can also be negated without the need for an ending particle by putting [tpl]IPA|/ʔɑt/[/tpl] before them.
[tpl]lang|km|ខ្ញុំជឿ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|/kʰɲom cɨə/[/tpl] – I believe
[tpl]lang|km|ខ្ញុំមិនជឿទេ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|/kʰɲom min cɨə teː/[/tpl] – I don't believe
[tpl]lang|km|ខ្ញុំឥតជឿ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|/kʰɲom ʔɑt cɨə/[/tpl] – I don't believe

===Numerals===

The numbers are:

==Social registers==

Khmer employs a system of registers in which the speaker must always be conscious of the social status of the person spoken to. The different registers, which include those used for common speech, polite speech, speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks, employ alternate verbs, names of body parts and pronouns. This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and, in fact, isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register. As an example, the word for "to eat" used between intimates or in reference to animals is [tpl]IPA|/siː/[/tpl]. Used in polite reference to commoners, it's [tpl]IPA|/ɲam/[/tpl]. When used of those of higher social status, it's [tpl]IPA|/pisa/[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|/tɔtuəl tiən/[/tpl]. For monks the word is [tpl]IPA|/cʰan/[/tpl] and for royals, [tpl]IPA|/saoj/[/tpl]. Another result is that the pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations, just a few of which are shown in the table below.

==Writing system==

Khmer is written with the Khmer script, an abugida developed from the Pallava script of India before the 7th century when the first known inscription appeared.Khmer Alphabet at Omniglot.com Written left-to-right with vowel signs that can be placed after, before, above or below the consonant they follow, the Khmer script is similar in appearance and usage to Thai and Lao, both of which were based on the Khmer system. The Khmer script is also distantly related to the Mon script, the ancestor of the modern Burmese script. Khmer numerals, which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more widely than Hindu-Arabic numerals. Within Cambodia, literacy in the Khmer alphabet is estimated at 77.6%.United Nations in Cambodia "Celebration of International Literacy Day, 2011"
Consonant symbols in Khmer are divided into two groups, or series. The first series carries the inherent vowel [tpl]IPA|/ɑː/[/tpl] while the second series carries the inherent vowel [tpl]IPA|/ɔː/[/tpl]. The Khmer names of the series, [tpl]IPA|/aʔkʰosaʔ/[/tpl] ("voiceless") and [tpl]IPA|/kʰosaʔ/[/tpl] ("voiced"), respectively, indicate that the second series consonants were used to represent the voiced phonemes of Old Khmer.  As the voicing of stops was lost, however, the contrast shifted to the phonation of the attached vowels which, in turn, evolved into a simple difference of vowel quality, often by diphthongization.  This process has resulted in the Khmer alphabet having two symbols for most consonant phonemes and each vowel symbol having two possible readings, depending on the series of the initial consonant:
