Rite of Passage is a British-bred, Irish-trained Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the Ascot Gold Cup and being named Cartier Racing Award for European Champion Stayer in 2010. His career was unusual in the fact that he established himself as a high-class performer under National Hunt rules before moving to flat-racing. His win in the Gold Cup came in his third start under flat rules.

==Background==

Rite of Passage was bred by the Hertfordshire-based Newsells Park Stud. He was sired by the European Horse of the Year Giant's Causeway out of the mare Dahlia's Krissy. Since retiring to stud in 2001 Giant's Causeway has sired the winners of more than three hundred races, including 26 at Group One/Grade I level. His best winners include Shamardal, Aragorn and Eskendereya[tpl]cite web|url=http://bloodstock.racingpost.com/stallionbook/stallion.sd?horse_id=513047&popup=1 |title=Giant's Causeway Stud Record |publisher=Bloodstock.racingpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl] Dahlia's Krissy was a winner in the United States and a grand-daughter of the Champion racemare Dahlia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/horse_home_popup.sd?horse_id=699703#topHorseTabs=horse_pedigree&bottomHorseTabs=horse_form |title=Rite Of Passage pedigree |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl]

==Racing career==

===2008/2009 season: National Hunt flat races===

Rite of Passage began his racing career by running in National Hunt flat races or "bumpers". These are races designed to give experience to potential jumpers and are run at National Hunt meetings. Rite of Passage won one of these events, at Galway in August 2008, starting the 9/4 favourite and beating 19 rivals "very easily".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=463710&r_date=2008-08-02&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Kerrymaid NHF race result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl] Six months later he reappeared at Naas in a similar event and won by six lengths from the odds-on favourite Quadrillon. February before being sent to the Cheltenham Festival for the Grade I Champion Bumper where Pat Smullen replaced the amateur Robbie McNamara as his jockey. The race appeared to lie between Rite of Passage, who was made 5/2 favourite,  and another unbeaten Irish horse Dunguib.[tpl]cite news|last=Cook |first=Chris |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2009/mar/11/horse-racing-gambling |title=news and views on day two of the Cheltenham Festival  |publisher=Guardian |date=2009-03-11 |accessdate=2011-09-25 |location=London[/tpl] Rite of Passage moved up to dispute the lead two furlong out but looked outpaced in the closing stages and finished third, ten lengths behind Dunguib.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=475223&r_date=2009-03-11&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Champion Bumper result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl] On his final "bumper" appearance at the Curragh in May he was made odds-on favourite, but finished fourth.

===2009 Flat season===

Rite of Passage was switched to conventional flat racing and won both his starts. As his wins had been under National Hunt rules he was still eligibe to run in maiden races and was an odds-on winner of such a race at Ballinrobe in September. He was then sent to Leopardstown for a two-mile handicap. Smullen sent the gelding into the lead two and a half furlongs from the finish and soon went clear. Although he was eased down in the closing stages, Rite of Passage won by eight lengths from the favourite Donna's Palm.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=494133&r_date=2009-11-05&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title= Leopardtown November Hcap reult|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl]

===2009/2010 season: Novice hurdles===

In the National Hunt season of 2009/2010, Rite of Passage was campaigned in Novice hurdle races. These are races for horses which have not won a race over hurdles before the start of the season.  In January at Leopardstown he won on his hurding debut, when his only danger came when he was carried wide by a loose (riderless) horse on the turn into the straight.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=498028&r_date=2010-01-24&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Frank Conroy Hurdle result|publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl] At Punchestown a month later he won another novices' race "comfortably" at odds of 2/7,[tpl]cite news|last=Armytage |first=Marcus |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/7259000/Rite-of-Passage-heads-for-Cheltenham-Festival.html |title=Rite of Passage heads for Cheltenham Festival |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-02-17 |accessdate=2011-09-25 |location=London[/tpl] before returning to Cheltenham for the Grade I Baring Novices' Hurdle. For the second year in succession Rite of Passage was an unsuccessful Festival favourite, finishing third to the undefeated Peddlers Cross.

===2010 Flat season===

At Royal Ascot ran in his third conventional flat race, the Group One Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles for which he started a 20/1 outsider. Rite of Passage raced in third and survived a "barging match" with the tiring Akmal (for which Smullen was subsequently disciplined)[tpl]cite news|author=J A McGrath |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/7836561/Dermot-Weld-realises-his-Gold-Cup-ambition-Horse-Racing.html |title=Dermot Weld realises his Gold Cup ambition |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-06-17 |accessdate=2011-09-25 |location=London[/tpl] to challenge Age of Aquarius for the lead a furlong out. The two horses raced together to the line with Rite of Passage maintaining a narrow advantage to win by a neck.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=503543&r_date=2010-06-17&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Gold Cup result |publisher=Racing Post |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl] It was his trainer's first success in the race after narrow failures with the notable stayers Vintage Crop and Vinnie Roe in 1994 and 2002 respectively. Weld emphasised the importance of stamina in the victory, quoting Lester Piggott who had reportedly told him that "there's a big difference between horses that go two miles and horses that go two and a half."[tpl]cite news|author=Greg Wood|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/jun/17/dermot-weld-ascot-gold-cup |title=Dermot Weld finally wins Gold Cup  |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2010-06-17|accessdate=2011-09-25 |location=London[/tpl]

===2011 Flat season===

Rite of Passage did not run for more than eleven months after his Gold Cup win. On his reappearance he finished third to Fame and Glory in the Saval Beg Stakes.

Rite of Passage was aimed at a second Gold Cup, but had problems in training, and was ruled out of the race by Weld five days before the event.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2011/0611/1224298735517.html |title=Passage out of Ascot Gold Cup |publisher=The Irish Times |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate=2011-09-25[/tpl]
