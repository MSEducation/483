"DJ Culture" is the first single released by British electronic music group Pet Shop Boys from their singles collection album Discography: The Complete Singles Collection. The single peaked at #13 on the UK Singles Chart in 1991. Another version of the song, remixed by The Grid and entitled "Dj cultu''remix''" was also released as a single and entered the UK charts at #40.
According to the singer Neil Tennant, the song concerned the insincerity of how President George H. W. Bush's speeches at the time of the First Gulf War utilised Winston Churchill's wartime rhetoric, in a manner similar to how artists sample music from other artists.The Anecdotal Antidote  The video clip alternately features Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe as a pair of doctors, a pair of soldiers in desert combat dress, a judge presiding over Oscar Wilde (the line "And I my lord, may I say nothing?" is a close paraphrase of Wilde's comment after being sentenced to hard labour for homosexual practices) and a football referee and fan.
The French sample in the song is taken from the 1950 Jean Cocteau movie Orph√©e: in it coded and poetic messages are sent over the radio.
