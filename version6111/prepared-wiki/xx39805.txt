Melba toast is a dry, crisp and thinly sliced toast, often served with soup and salad or topped with either melted cheese or pâté. It is named after Dame Nellie Melba, the stage name of Australian opera singer Helen Porter Mitchell. Its name is thought to date from 1897, when the singer was very ill and it became a staple of her diet.History of Melba Toast The toast was created for her by chef and fan Auguste Escoffier, who also created the Peach Melba dessert for her. The hotel proprietor César Ritz supposedly named it in a conversation with Escoffier.[ref]

The thin slices are then returned to the grill with the untoasted sides towards the heat source, resulting in toast half the normal thickness.Great British Cookbook – Melba Toast Thus, it can be described as a twice-baked food (see under rusk).
