Athlone ([tpl]lga|Baile Átha Luain|town of Luan's ford[/tpl])P.W. Joyce, http://www.booksulster.com/library/plnm/placenamesA.php. Local historians describe it as The Ford of the Moon is a town on the River Shannon near the southern shore of Lough Ree in Ireland. It is the largest town in the Midlands Region.Regions of Ireland: Midland Regional Authorities. Iro.ie. The town is governed by an elected town council, which appoints a Mayor.
Athlone is on the border of counties Roscommon (province of Connacht) and Westmeath (province of Leinster). Although the River Shannon forms the historic border between Roscommon and Westmeath, the Local Government Act of 1898 designated all of Athlone (Urban) as belonging to Westmeath, including areas west of the river. Much recent growth has occurred outside the official town boundaries.
The Census of Ireland 2011 recorded the population of the town at 20,153, making Athlone the most populous town in the Midlands and the 17th most populous in the state.CSO – Census 2011 – Small Area Population Statistics. Census.cso.ie.
Athlone is near the geographical centre of Ireland which is 8.85 kilometres north-northwest of the town, in the townland of Carnagh East in County Roscommon.Frequently Asked Questions Ordnance Survey Ireland. Retrieved 30 January 2012.

==History==

At the heart of Athlone, both geographically and historically, is the Athlone Castle. The ford of Athlone was strategically important, as south of Athlone the Shannon is impassable until Clonmacnoise (where the Esker Riada meets the Shannon), and north is Lough Ree. In 1001 Brian Bóru led his army from Kincora into the town, his fleet sailing up the river via Lough Derg to attend a gathering.
A bridge was built across the river in the 12th century, approximately 100 metres south of the current bridge. To protect this a fort was constructed on the west bank in the town by Turloch Mór Ó Conor. On a number of occasions both the fort and bridge were subject to attacks, and towards the end of the 12th century the Anglo-Normans constructed a motte-and-bailey fortification here. This was superseded by a stone structure built in 1210 by Justiciar John de Gray. The 12-sided donjon dates from this time. The rest of the castle was largely destroyed during the Siege of Athlone and subsequently rebuilt and enlarged.
During the wars that racked Ireland in the seventeenth century, Athlone held a vital position, holding the main bridge over the River Shannon into Connacht. In the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–1653), the town was held by Irish Confederate troops until it was taken late in 1650 by Charles Coote, who attacked the town from the west, having crossed into Connacht at Sligo.
Forty years later, during the pan-European War of the Grand Alliance, the town was again of key strategic importance, being one of the Jacobite strongholds defending the river-crossings into the confederate-held Province of Connacht following their being routed at the battle of the Boyne 1 July 1690. In that year, the Jacobite forces of Colonel Richard Grace repelled an attack by 10,000 men led by Commander Douglas. In the following year's campaign, the Siege of Athlone saw a further assault by a larger allied force in which the invading troops of King William and Queen Mary eventually overran the entire city, forcing the defenders to flee further west toward the River Suck at such speed that eyewitnesses account they "flung their cannons into the morass" as they fled. The most recent account of the Siege of Athlone was discovered in 2004 in an archive in the Netherlands and written on 5 July 1691 after the attack had ended. The contemporary source was penned by the victorious commanding-officer from the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, general lieutenant Godard van Reede, in letters written to his family-members on mainland Europe.5 Jul 1691, From the Army Camp at Athloon [tpl]sic[/tpl]: letter from Godard van Reede, general lieutenant of their majesties of England combined forces at land and at sea in Ireland 1690–1691, to his father, a multimedia webcast of a live broadcast by Ballinasloe Community Radio 102.8 FM, 10 July 2004 In the account, the commanding allied officer reported that half of the city's defenders retreated westward towards the rest of their army, leaving almost 2,000 dead within the city walls, with more than 100 taken prisoner among whom were dozens of officers.
In the 1970s it was proposed in the Republican Éire Nua programme to make Athlone the capital city of a federal United Ireland.

==Literature==

American crime writer James M. Cain references Athlone in his 1937 book Serenade, in a passage where two characters discuss tenor John McCormack:
"--There's the language he was born to. John McCormack comes from Dublin".
"He does not. He comes from Athlone".
"Didn't he live in Dublin?".
"No Matter. They speak a fine brogue in Athlone, almost as fine as in Belfast".
"It's a fine brogue, but it's not brogue. It's the English language as it was spoken before all the other countries of the world forgot how to speak it. There's two things a singer can't buy, beg or steal, and that no teacher, coach or conductor can give him. One is his voice, the other is the language that was born in his mouth. When McCormack was singing Handel he was singing English, and he sings it as no American and no Englishman will ever sing English".

==Transport==

===River===

The River Shannon runs through Athlone and the town is a popular spot for people passing through on pleasure craft, many of whom stop off at the Marinas. Lough Ree, the largest lake on the Shannon, is a short distance upstream from Athlone. Many boat hire companies work from here including athlonecruisers, the oldest hire boat company on the River Shannon. Boats passing through Athlone nowadays use a lock in the river, beside the weir and downstream of the current road bridge. The lock, weir and bridge were constructed by the Shannon navigation commissioners in the 1840s. Before then, boats used a canal, about a mile and a half long, to the west of the river. The canal was built by Thomas Omer for the Commissioners of Inland Navigation.Ruth Delany, The Shannon Navigation, Lilliput Press, Dublin 2008. Work started in 1757 and had over 300 men at work. He built a single lock 120′ X 19′ with a rise of 4.5′, but there was also a guard lock, further upstream, with a single set of gates to protect the canal against floods. There were two lay-bys (harbours), one above the lock and the other at the upstream end. The old canal is no longer navigable.

==Broadcasting==

Between 1931 and 1975 the main radio transmission centre for Irish radio was located at Moydrum, Athlone (GC: [tpl]Coord|53|25|14|N|7|52|52|W|type:landmark[/tpl]). The original call-sign was 2RN (a wordplay on the song "Come back to Erin"). It subsequently became known as "Radio Athlone" and could clearly be heard throughout Europe, and as far as Moscow. This changed as bandwidth allocations were accorded at the Helsinki Declaration.
It operated at a power of 60 kW (further increased to 100 kW in the 1950s). As antenna a T-antenna was and is used, which is spun between two 100 metres tall guyed masts with square cross section and which are insulated against ground. Many old radio sets in Europe had the "Athlone" dial position marked near the end of their tuning scales.
In the late 1970s the station reopened on a new dial position of 612 kHz for "Radio 2" (later known as RTÉ 2fm).
Moydrum was also the location of Ireland's short lived Shortwave international radio service that was closed down in 1948 due to lack of money. Today, RTÉ's Midlands studios are located in Athlone, at St. Mary's Square. The local radio station is Midlands 103. Many also tune into Shannonside.Shannonside – Home. Shannonside.ie.
