Princes Park is a football stadium in Dartford, Kent, England. It is the home of Dartford F.C.. Greenwich Borough F.C. have been sharing the ground with the Darts since 2013. The stadium's postcode is DA1 1RT, the closest possible representation of the word "Dart". DA1 1FC was unobtainable, as the letter C is not allocated for use at the end of British postcodes. The stadium is owned by Dartford Borough Council.

Construction work began on 14 November 2005. Designed by Alexander Sedgley architects, the stadium has a capacity of 4,100 (642 seated), and has been described as one of the most ecologically sound ever built.[ref]
