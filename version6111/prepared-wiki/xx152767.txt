The Omni Providence Hotel (formerly The Westin Providence) is a Neo-Traditionalist skyscraper in downtown Providence, Rhode Island.  At [tpl]convert|100|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl], it became the fourth-tallest building in the city and the state on 15 February 2007, when the nearby slightly taller The Residences Providence topped out. Brick facades and a pitched roof adorn the building.
With the completion of the Residences tower, that added 200 rooms, the Omni Providence now boasts 564 rooms, and is still the tallest and largest hotel in Providence, having usurped the title from the 1922 Providence Biltmore upon completion.
William McKenzie Woodward, a local architectural historian and staff member of the Rhode Island Historical Preservation & Heritage Commission does not believe its styling to be architecturally innovative, calling it "yet another bland addition to the city's growing recent collection of buildings seemingly designed not to offend."[tpl]cite book | last=Woodward | first=William McKenzie | coauthors= | title=Guide to Providence Architecture | location=Providence  | publisher=Providence Preservation Society | year=2003 | isbn=0-9742847-0-X [/tpl]
The hotel, originally built in 1993 as The Westin Providence, was sold to Omni Hotels in October 2012, and was converted to the Omni Providence Hotel on January 15, 2013.http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2012/10/omni-acquires-westin-hotel-in-providence.html
