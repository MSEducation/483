[[The Spring Arts Festival]]

CATEGORIES: Music festivals in Europe, Festivals in Monaco

The Printemps des Arts, which was created in response to the wishes of the late Princess Grace and which is today under the patronage of SAR the Princess Caroline of Hanover, proposes, at a time of the year where festivals are scarce, a selection of musical events of international quality, with an emphasis on music and dance. 
The quality of the ensembles and artists, the will to create quality musical events through the creation and commissioning of new pieces, quickly attracted numerous radio stations and television to the Principality, and gave place to numerous record productions, which have enabled the Printemps des Arts to acquire its international reputation.
