==Music video==

The music video, which is in black-and-white and directed by Behn Fannin, begins with Ryan Ross playing his guitar and someone digging with a spade. The camera zooms out to reveal the band playing the song in a field. Then the lyrics "Fantastic posing greed" are seen painted on a billboard in the middle of a city, with a man looking up towards it. The lyrics "We should feed our jewelry to the sea" also appear on a billboard. Other lyrics appear on other objects, such as newspapers and public restroom mirrors. 
Spencer Smith then tapes "Hey moon" onto everybody's car bumper in a parking lot and runs away. Spray cans are then seen being dropped by Ross, who runs around a corner, after having spray-painted the lyrics "I missed your skin when you were east" on a wall, which soon appears on the news with the headline "Strange Graffiti in the Tri-County Area". A news reporter interviews an eyewitness about it, who has "You clicked your heels and wished for me" printed on his shirt. After this, there are more shots of the band playing, while young people are digging around them. More lyrics appear in even more places. 
Afterwards, Jon Walker is seen attaching the lyrics "My one and lonely", which are painted on plastic tags, to security cameras in parking lots, then he runs away. Lyrics are now painted on streets and freeways by Brendon Urie, and the band sneak into two skyscrapers, turning on the lights in such a way that they form the lyrics "Hey moon". The band gets hold of a searchlight and project the lyrics "Hey moon" onto the night sky. The final shot takes place in the field where the band is playing. The lyrics "Never yawn" are seen carved into the field.
