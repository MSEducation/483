Your Independent Grocer is a supermarket chain based in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is a unit of National Grocers, itself a unit of Loblaw Companies Limited, Canada's largest food distributor. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] Stores are typically operated by a franchise owner. Many of the stores were originally Ottawa-area outlets of the defunct Quebec-based Steinberg's grocery chain. When Steinberg's was bought out by Metro Richelieu in 1992, the Ottawa-area franchises were spun off into the separate Your Independent Grocer chain.
