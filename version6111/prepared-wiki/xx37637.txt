The Steward's Lodge is the official residence of the Taoiseach (prime minister) of Ireland. The lodge is a four bedroom house which was originally part of the Farmleigh estate, alongside the Phoenix Park in Dublin.

==History==

===Origins===

The Steward's Lodge was originally built in the grounds of Farmleigh house – an 18th Century estate which was formerly owned by members of the Guinness family. Originally accessible within the grounds of the estate, the lodge was subsequently separated from Farmleigh during later refurbishment works.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/opulent-phoenix-park-lodge-is--set-to-become-fortress-cowen-1378987.html|title=Opulent Phoenix Park lodge is set to become 'Fortress Cowen'|work=Irish Independent|date=18 May 2008|accessdate=18 May 2008|first=Ronald|last=Quinlan[/tpl]

===Taoiseach's residence===

Historically, there was no official residence of the Taoiseach, with each Taoiseach residing in either their own homes, or in an apartment in Dublin. In the 1970s, plans were made to turn the former Apostolic Nunciature (formerly the Under Secretary's Lodge) in the Phoenix Park into an official residence. However, the plans fell through and the Georgian building was subsequently demolished.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/state-papers-day-one-aras-for-taoiseach-project-abandoned-140675.html |title=State Papers – Day One: Áras for Taoiseach project abandoned |work=Irish Examiner |date=30 December 2010[/tpl]
In 2006, it was announced by the Office of Public Works that the Steward's Lodge had been renovated, at a cost of nearly €600,000.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.examiner.ie/story/ireland/idausnmhkf/rss2/ |title=Farmleigh lodge slept in for 7 nights since €600k revamp |work=Irish Examiner |date=31 December 2008|accessdate=4 November 2011[/tpl] It was speculated that the house would become the official private residence of the Taoiseach after the 2007 general election and any official engagements would be carried out in the nearby Farmleigh or Government Buildings.[ref]

There was political sensitivity at government level about the project, with some concerned that it could be depicted as a lavish "perk" for the Taoiseach. In 2005, a spokeswoman for Bertie Ahern stated he had no interest in using it, and he remained resident in his private home in Drumcondra in Dublin. In 2008, it was reported that Brian Cowen, might use it as his official residence. Media reports suggest that Garda concerns for the Taoiseach's security precluded him from continuing to reside in his own Dublin home in the city centre. Cowen did not formally reside in the Steward's lodge, preferring to return to his family home in County Offaly, but he did use it "from time to time".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0129/1232923372778.html|title=Cowen questioned on use of Farmleigh|work=The Irish Times|date=29 January 2009|accessdate=29 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/cowen-stays-at-farmleigh-more-often-1840258.html|title=Cowen stays at Farmleigh more often|work=Irish Independent|date=25 July 2009|accessdate=26 July 2009|first=Jason|last=O'Brien[/tpl] In 2011, the Mail on Sunday and Sunday Mirror newspapers reported that the current Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, would make use of the residence,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-249501947.html|title=Enda to swap city for Farmleigh|publisher=Mail on Sunday|date=February 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Farmleigh+gets+ready+to+welcome+the+Kennys.-a0250052866|title=Farmleigh gets ready to welcome the Kennys|publisher=Sunday Mirror Newspaper|date=February 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-249501822.html|title=Enda to Leave Handy Flat over Pub Plan to Cut out State Cars and Free Rides|publisher=Mail on Sunday|date=February 2011[/tpl] but there is no indication that he has used the Lodge over his private Dublin apartment or Castlebar residence.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/masked-protesters-picket-taoiseachs-house-29349284.html|title=Masked protesters picket Taoiseach's house in Castlebar|publisher=Irish Independent|date=17 June 2013[/tpl]
