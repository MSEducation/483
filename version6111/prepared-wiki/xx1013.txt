Cleveland [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|iː|v|l|ən|d[/tpl] is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and is the county seat of Cuyahoga County,[tpl]GR|6[/tpl] the most populous county in the state. The city is located in northeastern Ohio on the southern shore of Lake Erie, approximately [tpl]convert|60|mi|km[/tpl] west of the Pennsylvania border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, and became a manufacturing center owing to its location on the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines. Cleveland's economy has diversified sectors that include manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, and biomedical.

==History==

Cleveland obtained its name on July 22, 1796 when surveyors of the Connecticut Land Company laid out Connecticut's Western Reserve into townships and a capital city they named "Cleaveland" after their leader, General Moses Cleaveland. Cleaveland oversaw the plan for what would become the modern downtown area, centered on Public Square, before returning home, never again to visit Ohio. The first settler in Cleaveland was Lorenzo Carter, who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River. The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23, 1814.[tpl]cite web | url=http://ech.case.edu/timeline.html | title=Cleveland: A Bicentennial Timeline | publisher=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate=August 10, 2007[/tpl]  In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, its waterfront location proved to be an advantage. The area began rapid growth after the 1832 completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal.  This key link between the Ohio River and the Great Lakes connected the city to the Atlantic Ocean via the Erie Canal and later via the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. Growth continued with added railroad links.[tpl]cite web | url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=OAEC | title=Ohio and Erie Canal | publisher=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate=August 10, 2007[/tpl] Cleveland incorporated as a city in 1836.
In 1836, the city, then located only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring Ohio City over a bridge connecting the two.[tpl]cite web | url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CSB | title=Columbus Street Bridge | publisher=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate=August 10, 2007[/tpl] Ohio City remained an independent municipality until its annexation by Cleveland in 1854.
The city's prime geographic location as transportation hub on the Great Lakes has played an important role in its development as a commercial center. Cleveland serves as a destination point for iron ore shipped from Minnesota, as well as coal transported by rail. In 1870, John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in Cleveland, and moved its headquarters to New York City in 1885.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rockefellers/timeline/index.html | title=Rockefellers Timeline | accessdate=July 7, 2010 | date=1999–2000 | publisher=PBS | quote=1870 Rockefeller founds Standard Oil of Ohio with $1 million in capital, the largest corporation in the country.

Other manufacturers located in Cleveland produced steam-powered cars, which included White and Gaeth, as well as the electric car company Baker. By 1920, due in large part to the city's economic prosperity, Cleveland became the nation's fifth largest city. The city counted Progressive Era politicians such as the populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson among its leaders. Many prominent Clevelanders from this era are buried in the historic Lake View Cemetery, including President James A. Garfield,Find A Grave: Lake View Cemetery.

In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived as a way to energize a city after the Great Depression, it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937.[tpl]cite web | url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=GLE | title=Great Lakes Exposition | publisher=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate=August 10, 2007[/tpl] The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport, among others.[tpl]cite book | author=Porter, Philip |url=http://www.clevelandmemory.org/SpecColl/porter/Chapt06.html |title=Cleveland: Confused City on a Seesaw | chapter=Chapter 6 | pages=106–107 | year=1976 | location=Columbus, Ohio | publisher=Ohio State University Press | isbn= 0-8142-0264-0 | accessdate= July 22, 2009 [/tpl]

During the African-American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, social unrest occurred in Cleveland, resulting in the Hough Riots from July 18, 1966 – July 23, 1966 and the Glenville Shootout from July 23, 1968 – July 25, 1968. In December 1978, Cleveland became the first major American city to enter into a financial default on federal loans since the Great Depression. Suburbanization changed the city in the late 1960s and 1970s, when financial difficulties and a notorious 1969 fire on the Cuyahoga River challenged the city. This, along with the city's struggling professional sports teams, drew negative national press. As a result, Cleveland was often derided as "The Mistake on the Lake".[tpl]cite web |date=September 10, 2007 |title=Cleveland: A Midwestern Rustbelt City Struggles to Sur(Re)vive |url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/cscr/seminars/Keating.doc |first=Dennis |last=Keating |location=Cleveland, Ohio [/tpl]

The shore of Lake Erie is [tpl]convert|569|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level; however, the city lies on a series of irregular bluffs lying roughly perpendicular to the lake. In Cleveland these bluffs are cut principally by the Cuyahoga River, Big Creek, and Euclid Creek. The land rises quickly from the lakeshore. Public Square, less than a mile (2 km) inland, sits at an elevation of [tpl]convert|650|ft|m|0[/tpl], and Hopkins Airport, only [tpl]convert|5|mi|km|0[/tpl] inland from the lake, is at an elevation of [tpl]convert|791|ft|m|0[/tpl].[ref]

====Architecture====

Cleveland's downtown architecture is diverse. Many of the city's government and civic buildings, including City Hall, the Cuyahoga County Courthouse, the Cleveland Public Library, and Public Auditorium, are clustered around an open mall and share a common neoclassical architecture. Built in the early 20th century, they are the result of the 1903 Group Plan, and constitute one of the most complete examples of City Beautiful design in the United States.[tpl]cite book |last=Lawrence |first=Michael |title=Make No Little Plans |year=1980 |pages=20–25 |publisher=Western Reserve Historical Society |location=Cleveland, Ohio |isbn=0-911704-24-8[/tpl] The Terminal Tower, dedicated in 1930, was the tallest building in North America outside New York City until 1964 and the tallest in the city until 1991.[tpl]cite book |author=Toman, James and Cook, Daniel |title=Cleveland's Towering Treasure |year=2005 |chapter=The Tower |page=76 |publisher=Cleveland Landmarks Press |location=Cleveleand, Ohio |isbn=0-936760-20-6[/tpl] It is a prototypical Beaux-Arts skyscraper. The two newer skyscrapers on Public Square, Key Tower (currently the tallest building in Ohio) and the 200 Public Square, combine elements of Art Deco architecture with postmodern designs. Another of Cleveland's architectural treasures is The Arcade (sometimes called the Old Arcade), a five-story arcade built in 1890 and renovated in 2001 as a Hyatt Regency Hotel.[tpl]cite web |last= |first= |title=The Arcade: A Cleveland Classic |url=http://www.thearcade-cleveland.com/ |publisher= |accessdate=September 17, 2007[/tpl] Cleveland's landmark ecclesiastical architecture includes the historic Old Stone Church in downtown Cleveland and the onion domed St. Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Tremont, along with myriad ethnically inspired Roman Catholic churches.[tpl]cite web |url=http://urban.csuohio.edu/sacredlandmarks/csl/ |title=Cleveland Sacred Landmarks |publisher=Cleveland State University |accessdate=January 5, 2008[/tpl] Running east from Public Square through University Circle is Euclid Avenue, which was known for its prestige and elegance.

====Neighborhoods====

Downtown Cleveland is centered on Public Square and includes a wide range of diversified districts. Downtown Cleveland is home to the traditional Financial District and Civic Center, as well as the distinct Cleveland Theater District, which is home to Playhouse Square Center. Mixed-use neighborhoods such as the Flats and the Warehouse District are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants and bars. The number of downtown housing units in the form of condominiums, lofts, and apartments has been on the increase since 2000. Recent developments include the revival of the Flats, the Euclid Corridor Project, and the developments along East 4th Street.[tpl]cite news |first=Steven |last=Litt |coauthors= |title=RTA's Euclid Avenue HealthLine is faring well in ridership, innovation |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/architecture/2009/11/rtas_euclid_avenue_healthline.html |work=The Plain Dealer |publisher= |date=2009-11-29 |accessdate=2009-11-30 [/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/Clevelands-Signs-of-Renewal.html|title=Cleveland’s Signs of Renewal|last=Michener|first=Charles|date=April 2011|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=22 January 2013[/tpl]

Three neighborhoods in the Cuyahoga Valley are sometimes referred to as the south side: Industrial Valley/Duck Island, Slavic Village (North and South Broadway), and Tremont.
Several inner-city neighborhoods have begun to gentrify in recent years. Areas on both the west side (Ohio City, Tremont, Detroit-Shoreway, and Edgewater) and the east side (Collinwood, Hough, Fairfax, and Little Italy) have been successful in attracting increasing numbers of creative class members, which in turn is spurring new residential development.Kennedy, Maureen and Leonard, Paul.

Summers are hot and humid while winters are cold and snowy. The Lake Erie shoreline is very close to due east-west from the mouth of the Cuyahoga west to Sandusky, but at the mouth of the Cuyahoga it turns sharply northeast. This feature is the principal contributor to the lake effect snow that is typical in Cleveland (especially on the city's East Side) from mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, usually in late January or early February. The lake effect also causes a relative differential in geographical snowfall totals across the city: while Hopkins Airport, on the city's far West Side, has only reached [tpl]convert|100|in|cm|0[/tpl] of snowfall in a season three times since record-keeping for snow began in 1893,Cleveland Snowfalle (sic) Statistics.

Cleveland has served as the setting for several major studio and independent films. Players from the 1948 Cleveland Indians, winners of the World Series, appear in The Kid from Cleveland (1949). Cleveland Municipal Stadium features prominently in both that film and The Fortune Cookie (1966); written and directed by Billy Wilder, the picture marked Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon's first on-screen collaboration and features gameday footage of the 1965 Cleveland Browns. Director Jules Dassin's first American film in nearly twenty years, Up Tight! (1968) is set in Cleveland immediately following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Set in 1930s Cleveland, Sylvester Stallone leads a local labor union in F.I.S.T. (1978).

Clevelander Jim Jarmusch's critically acclaimed and independently produced Stranger Than Paradise (1984)—a deadpan comedy about two New Yorkers who travel to Florida by way of Cleveland—was a favorite of the Cannes Film Festival, winning the Caméra d'Or. The cult-classic mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap (1984) includes a memorable scene where the parody band gets lost backstage just before performing at a Cleveland rock concert (origin of the phrase "Hello, Cleveland!").

Cleveland has often doubled for other locations in film. The wedding and reception scenes in The Deer Hunter (1978), while set in the small Pittsburgh suburb of Clairton, were actually shot in the Cleveland neighborhood of Tremont; U.S. Steel also permitted the production to film in one of its Cleveland mills. Francis Ford Coppola produced The Escape Artist (1982), much of which was shot in Downtown Cleveland near City Hall and the Cuyahoga County Courthouse, as well as the Flats. A Christmas Story (1983) was set in Indiana, but drew many of its external shots—including the Parker family home—from Cleveland. Much of Double Dragon (1994) and Happy Gilmore (1996) were also shot in Cleveland, and the opening shots of Air Force One (1997) were filmed in and above Severance Hall.

===Literature===

The American modernist poet Hart Crane was born in nearby Garrettsville, Ohio in 1899. His adolescence was divided between Cleveland and Akron before moving to New York City, finally in 1916. Aside from factory work during the first world war, he served as reporter to The Plain Dealer for a short period, before achieving recognition in the Modernist literary scene. A diminutive memorial park is dedicated to Crane along the left bank of the Cuyahoga in Cleveland.  In University Circle, a historical marker sits at the location of his Cleveland childhood house on E. 115 near the Euclid Ave intersection.  On Case Western Reserve University campus, a statue of him stands immediately behind the Kelvin Smith Library.

===Cuisine===

Cleveland's melting pot of immigrant groups and their various culinary traditions have long played an important role in defining the local cuisine. Examples of these can particularly be found in neighborhoods such as Little Italy, Slavic Village, and Tremont.
Local mainstays of Cleveland's cuisine include an abundance of Polish and Central European contributions, such as kielbasa, stuffed cabbage and pierogies. Cleveland also has plenty of corned beef, with nationally renowned Slyman's, on the near East Side, a perennial winner of various accolades from Esquire Magazine, including being named the best corned beef sandwich in America in 2008.[tpl]cite journal | title=The Best Sandwiches in America | journal=Esquire | date=February 16, 2008| id=| url=http://www.esquire.com/features/food-drink/sandwiches | accessdate=August 13, 2010 | quote=Corned Beef Slyman's, Cleveland[/tpl] Other famed sandwiches include the Cleveland original, Polish Boy, a local favorite found at many BBQ and Soul food restaurants.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0702-JUL_AMERICA2_rev_2?click=main_sr | title=Eating Cleveland | accessdate=August 13, 2010 | last=Raab | first=Scott | date=July 1, 2002 | work=Esquire | quote=If you're not from Cleveland, you've never et a Polish Boy.

==Sports==

Cleveland's major professional sports teams include the Cleveland Indians (Major League Baseball), Cleveland Browns (National Football League), and Cleveland Cavaliers (National Basketball Association). Local sporting facilities include Progressive Field, FirstEnergy Stadium, Quicken Loans Arena and the Wolstein Center.
The Indians last reached the World Series in 1997, losing to the Florida Marlins, and have not won the series since 1948. Between 1995 and 2001, Progressive Field (then known as Jacobs Field) sold out 455 consecutive games, a Major League Baseball record until it was broken in 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eagletribune.com/pusports/local_story_253023720.html?keyword=topstory|title=Sellouts!

The Cavaliers won the Eastern Conference in 2007, but were defeated in the NBA Finals by the San Antonio Spurs. Although the Browns are historically among the winningest franchises in the NFL, the team has not won a championship since 1964. Cleveland facilities have hosted the Major League Baseball All-Star Game five times, and the NBA All-Star Game twice.
The city's failure to win a trophy in any major professional sport since 1964 has earned it a reputation of being a cursed sports city, which ESPN validated by proclaiming Cleveland as its "most tortured sports city" in 2004.[tpl]cite web | last=Darcy | first=Kieran | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=tortured/cleveland| title=Mistakes by the Lake | publisher=ESPN.com: | date=July 13, 2004 | accessdate=October 11, 2005 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20041013110332/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=tortured/cleveland |archivedate=October 13, 2004 | postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] In addition, changes in the Cleveland sports landscape have led to further heartbreak and resentment among local fans, the most notable instances being Art Modell's relocation of the Browns to Baltimore after the 1995 season (that franchise became the Ravens, with the current Browns team starting play in 1999), and Akron native LeBron James' decision to leave the Cavaliers in 2010 for the Miami Heat.[tpl]cite web | last=Walker | first=James | url=http://espn.go.com/blog/afcnorth/post/_/id/14793/take-your-pick-recap-lebron-vs-modell | title=Take your pick recap: LeBron vs. Modell | publisher=ESPN.com: | date=July 13, 2010 | accessdate=July 27, 2010 | postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]

Cleveland's position as a center of manufacturing established it as a hotbed of union activity early in its history. While other parts of Ohio, particularly Cincinnati and the southern portion of the state, have historically supported the Republican Party, Cleveland commonly breeds the strongest support in the state for the Democrats.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www3.uakron.edu/src/DataServ/Elections/ |title=Ohio Voter and Election Maps |last=Huskins |first=David |publisher=University of Akron Center for Policy Studies |accessdate=August 10, 2007[/tpl] At the local level, elections are nonpartisan. However, Democrats still dominate every level of government.

Cleveland's road system consists of numbered streets running roughly north-south, and named avenues, which run roughly east-west. The numbered streets are designated "east" or "west", depending where they lie in relation to Ontario Street, which bisects Public Square.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=SN1 |title=Street Names |work=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |date=March 4, 1998 |accessdate=October 20, 2012[/tpl] The numbered street system extends beyond the city limits into some suburbs on both the west and east sides. The named avenues that lie both on the east side of the Cuyahoga River and west of Ontario Street receive a "west" designation on street signage. The two downtown avenues which span the Cuyahoga change names on the west side of the river. Superior Avenue becomes Detroit Avenue on the west side, and Carnegie Avenue becomes Lorain Avenue. The bridges that make these connections are often called the Detroit–Superior Bridge and the Lorain–Carnegie Bridge.
