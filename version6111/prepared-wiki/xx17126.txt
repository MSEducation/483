[[Red–green alliance]]

In politics, a red–green alliance or red–green coalition is an alliance of "red" social-democratic or democratic socialist parties with "green" environmentalist or sometimes Nordic agrarian parties. The alliance is often based on common left political views, especially a shared distrust of corporate or capitalist institutions. While the "red" social-democratic parties tend to focus on the adverse effects of capitalism on the working class, the "green" environmentalist parties tend to focus on the ecological consequences of unrestrained capitalism.
The term was coined by conservative Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt in a debate against the Social Democrat opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson 1994.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gp.se/nyheter/valet2010/1.442687-orden-som-praglar-valrorelsen |title=Orden som präglar valrörelsen |publisher=Göteborgsposten |accessdate=2010-09-09[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl]
There have been two distinct types of red-green alliances. The first type is formed by centre-left parties for the short-term goal of creating a coalition government. The second type is a long-term organisational alliance of minor far-left parties for the purpose of challenging capitalism.
