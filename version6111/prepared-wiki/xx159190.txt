Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZBW), (radio communications, "Boston Center") is located in Nashua, New Hampshire, United States. The Boston ARTCC is one of 22 Air Route Traffic Control Centers in the United States.
The primary responsibility of ZBW is the separation of overflights, and the expedited sequencing of arrivals and departures along STARs (Standard Terminal Arrival Routes) and SIDs (Standard Instrument Departures) for the Boston Metropolitan Area, the New York Metropolitan Area, and many other areas.
Boston Center is the 14th busiest air traffic control center in the United States. In 2010, Boston Center was responsible for handling 1,721,000 flights.NATCA, Boston ARTCC - http://zbw.natca.org The Boston ARTCC currently covers [tpl]convert|165000|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of airspace that includes airports in Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire, New York state and northeast Pennsylvania.Statement Of Peter H Challan

==Sectors==

ZBW has a total of 30 sectors. These are broken down into Low Altitude, High Altitude, and Super High Altitude sectors, with 16 low sectors, 10 high sectors, and 1 super high sector. There are also three Low-High Altitude sectors which usually cover from the surface to unlimited and do not fit into any of the other sector categories. Within the center, there are five areas, which other ARTCCs often refer to as "Specialties".

==Areas==

In ZBW, the areas are labeled A through E.
Area A covers the majority of northeast New York state. Area A handles a large quantity of traffic that has departed Boston Logan International Airport or other nearby airports, as well as descending arrivals destined to New York metropolitan airports and other airports in ZBW airspace.
Area B covers most of Vermont and New Hampshire. Area B is primarily responsible for descending Boston Logan and Manchesterâ€“Boston Regional Airport arrivals, as well as climbing departures from these airports. Area B also descends and climbs traffic to and from airports such as Albany International Airport, Burlington International Airport, and Bradley International Airport.
Area C covers portions of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Area C also covers about [tpl]convert|60|mi[/tpl] of over-ocean airspace south of Long Island. Area C is responsible for descending Boston Logan arrivals, climbing Boston Logan departures, and working arrival and departure traffic to and from John F. Kennedy International Airport. Area C also climbs all northeast-bound and oceanic departures from the New York metropolitan area. Additionally, Area C descends and climbs traffic to and from airports such as T. F. Green Airport, Long Island MacArthur Airport, and Bradley International. Area C is the busiest area in Boston Center.
Area D is easily the largest area in ZBW, covering almost half of the total airspace. Area D overlies the eastern portions of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and most of Maine, as well as owning airspace extending around [tpl]convert|150|mi[/tpl] east of the coast. Area D is responsible for descending and climbing traffic to and from Boston Logan, Bangor International Airport, Portland International Jetport, and all Cape Cod area airports. Area D also includes some Canadian airspace, mostly over New Brunswick, but also a small area of Quebec. The bulk of this is an artifact dating back to the Cold War when Loring AFB, a SAC bomber base lying very close to the international border, was active. Loring's circular terminal control area, that no longer exists, extended into New Brunswick. This area was included with the rest of the TCA in Boston's area of responsibility. The base closed in 1994, but the Canadian airspace has not been transferred back to Canadian control.
Area E covers portions of New York state and western Massachusetts. Area E is primarily responsible for working traffic landing and departing New York metropolitan airports such as John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport. The New York TRACON underlies most of Area E.
ZBW is bordered by the following ARTCCs/ACCs/FIRs:

==Traffic Management Unit (TMU)==

It is the job of the TMU to balance air traffic demand with system capacity to ensure maximum efficiency and utilization of the airspace. As a result this creates a safe and orderly flow of traffic while minimizing delays. The TMU reports to the ATCSCC (Air Traffic Control System command center).
Some of the methods that can be used to help minimize delays are the following:

==Center Weather Service Unit==

The CWSU (Center Weather Service Unit) is a Joint Aviation Weather Support Team composed of on-site NWS (National Weather Service) meteorologists and an STMC (Supervisory Traffic Management Coordinator)/TMC (Traffic Management Coordinator) assigned to the WC (Weather Coordinator) Position. The purpose of the CWSU is to provide weather consultation and advice to managers and staff within ZBW and to other FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) facilities.

==Flight Data Communications Unit==

The purpose of this unit is to provide data processing and monitor all flight plan related entries into the HOCSR (HOST Oceanic Control System Replacement) computer.
