The International Council for Science (ICSU) is an international non-governmental organization devoted to international cooperation in the advancement of science. Its members are national scientific bodies and international scientific unions. As of 2012, it comprises 120 multi-disciplinary National Scientific Members, Associates and Observers representing 140 countries and 31 international, disciplinary Scientific Unions. ICSU also has 22 Scientific Associates.

==Mission and principles==

"ICSU’s mission is to strengthen international science for the benefit of society. To do this, ICSU mobilizes the knowledge and resources of the international science community to:
Activities focus on three areas: International Research Collaboration, Science for Policy, and Universality of Science.

==History==

ICSU is one of the oldest non-governmental organizations in the world and represents the evolution and expansion of two earlier bodies known as the International Association of Academies (IAA; 1899-1914) and the International Research Council (IRC; 1919-1931). In 1998, Members agreed that the Council’s current composition and activities would be better reflected by modifying the name from the International Council of Scientific Unions to the International Council for Science, while its rich history and strong identity would be well served by retaining the existing acronym, ICSU.ICSU’s A brief history web page, updated on 8 August 2012

==Universality of Science==

"The universality of science in its broadest sense is about developing a truly global scientific community on the basis of equity and non-discrimination. It is also about ensuring that science is trusted and valued by societies across the world. As such, it incorporates issues related to the conduct of science; capacity building; science education and literacy; access to data and information and the relationship between science and society. ... Underpinning this broader concept of universality is the Principle of the Universality of Science (ICSU Statute 5)ICSU Statute 5 which is more narrowly focused on the freedoms and responsibilities of science. Adherence to this Principle is a condition of ICSU membership. The policy Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the conduct of Science (CFRS)ICSU Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the conduct of Science serves as the guardian of the Principle and undertakes a variety of actions to defend scientific freedoms and promote integrity and responsibility."ICSU’s Universality of Science web section
The "Freedom and Responsibility Portal" on the ICSU's website documents its activities in these areas.ICSU’s freedom and responsibility web portal

==Structure==

The ICSU Secretariat (20 staff in 2012) in Paris ensures the day-to-day planning and operations under the guidance of an elected Executive Board. Three Policy Committees - Committee on Scientific Planning and Review (CSPR), Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the conduct of Science (CFRS) and Committee on Finance - assist the Executive Board in its work and a General Assembly of all Members is convened every three years. ICSU has three Regional Offices - Africa, Asia and the Pacific as well as Latin America and the Caribbean.

==Finances==

The principal source of ICSU's finances is the contributions it receives from its members. Other sources of income are the framework contracts from UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) and grants and contracts from United Nations bodies, foundations and agencies, which are used to support the scientific activities of the ICSU Unions and interdisciplinary bodies.
