[[Tea table]]

CATEGORIES: Erosion landforms

Geologically speaking, a tea table is a rock formation that is a remnant of newer strata that have eroded away.  A tea table is a type of rock column comprising discrete layers, usually of sedimentary rock, with the top layers being wider than the base due to greater resistance to erosion and weathering.  Sometimes these occur just beyond bluffs or cliffs at the end of a ridge; sometimes they are the only rock formation remnant on top of a ridge or even in fairly level ground. Tea tables are a variety of hoodoos.
Tea Tables are one of southern Illinois' Shawnee National Forest's claims to fame.
