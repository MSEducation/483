In May 2005, Bloomba was licensed to Corel Corporation and re-released as WordPerfect Mail, a component of the WordPerfect Office family.  WordPerfect Office is currently the most widely used alternative to Microsoft Office[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl].
Bloomba's primary focus is fast searching of email.  According to PC Magazine, it is up to eight times faster than Outlook in searching email.  It also earned PC Magazine's highest marks along with Eudora and Outlook[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl].
One of the interesting features is its risk free installation.  That is, it states that it can be installed beside an installation of Outlook or Eudora without interfering with the operation of the other email client.
Aside from the fast search, Bloomba appears to be comparable to Outlook or Eudora in its features and functionality.
Bloomba was co-developed by Chennai-based iSoftTech, a software outsourcing firm engaged by Stata Labs.
