In left-right politics, left-wing politics are political positions or activities that accept or support social equality, often in opposition to social hierarchy and social inequality.[tpl]cite book |last=Smith |first=T.

The political terms Left and Right were coined during the French Revolution (1789–1799), referring to the seating arrangement in the Estates General: those who sat on the left generally opposed the monarchy and supported the revolution, including the creation of a republic and secularization, while those on the right were supportive of the traditional institutions of the Old Regime. Use of the term "Left" became more prominent after the restoration of the French monarchy in 1815 when it was applied to the "Independents".Realms of memory: conflicts and divisions (1996), ed.

==History==

In politics, the term left wing derives from the French Revolution, as radical Montagnard and Jacobin deputies from the Third Estate generally sat to the left of the president's chair in parliament, a habit which began in the Estates General of 1789. Throughout the 19th century in France, the main line dividing left and right was between supporters of the French Republic and those of the Monarchy.[tpl]cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=67ttjXHhT3wC&dq=the+government+and+politics+of+france&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-35732-6[/tpl] The June Days Uprising during the Second Republic was an attempt by the left to assert itself after the 1848 Revolution, but only a small portion of the population supported this.
In the mid-19th century, nationalism, socialism, democracy, and anti-clericalism became features of the French Left. After Napoleon III's 1851 coup and the subsequent establishment of the Second Empire, Marxism began to rival radical republicanism and utopian socialism as a force within left-wing politics. The influential Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, published in 1848, asserted that all human history is the history of class struggle. They predicted that a proletarian revolution would eventually overthrow bourgeois capitalism and create a classless, stateless, post-monetary society.
In the United States, many leftists, social liberals, progressives and trade unionists were influenced by the works of Thomas Paine, who introduced the concept of asset-based egalitarianism, which theorises that social equality is possible by a redistribution of resources.
The International Workingmen's Association (1864–76), sometimes called the First International, brought together delegates from many different countries, with many different views about how to reach a classless and stateless society. Following a split between supporters of Marx and Mikhail Bakunin, anarchists formed the International Workers' Association.[tpl]cite book |last=Marshall |first=Peter |title=Demanding the Impossible  — A History of Anarchism |page=9 |publisher=Fontana Press |location=London |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-00-686245-1 [/tpl] The Second International (1888–1916) became divided over the issue of World War I. Those who opposed the war, such as Vladimir Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg, saw themselves as further to the left.
In the United States after Reconstruction, the phrase "the Left" was used to describe those who supported trade unions, the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement.[tpl]cite book |first=JoAnne C. |last=Reuss |title=American Folk Music and Left-Wing Politics |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8108-3684-6 [/tpl] More recently in the United States, left-wing and right-wing have often been used as synonyms for Democratic and Republican, or as synonyms for liberalism and conservatism respectively.[tpl]cite news| url=http://thepage.time.com/2009/03/03/steele-to-gop-fight-for-coleman/?xid=rss-page|title=Steel to gop fight for Coleman | work=Time | date=2009-03-03 | accessdate=2010-04-04[/tpl]ABC news, reported in The Week, May 15, 2009, page 13reported in Mother Jones, April 29, 2009[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-politics10sep10,0,5982337.story | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Study finds left-wing brain, right-wing brain | date=2007-09-10 | accessdate=2010-05-02 | first=Denise | last=Gellene[/tpl]

==Positions==

The following positions are typically associated with left-wing politics.

===Economics===

Leftist economic beliefs range from Keynesian economics and the welfare state through industrial democracy and the social market to nationalization of the economy and central planning,Andrew Glyn, Social Democracy in Neoliberal Times: The Left and Economic Policy since 1980, Oxford University Press, 2001, ISBN 978-0-19-924138-5, to the anarchist/ syndicalist advocacy of a council- and assembly-based self-managed anarchist communism. During the industrial revolution, left-wingers supported trade unions. In the early twentieth century, the Left were (with the notable exceptions of libertarians like the anarchists and revolutionary syndicalists) associated with policies advocating extensive government intervention in the economy.Eric D. Beinhocker. The origin of wealth. Harvard Business Press. 2006. ISBN 978-1-57851-777-0 p. 416 Google Books Leftists continue to criticize what they perceive as the exploitative nature of globalization, the race to the bottom and unjust lay-offs. In the last quarter of the Twentieth Century the belief that government (ruling in accordance with the interests of the people) ought to directly involve itself in the day to day workings of an economy declined in popularity amongst the center left, especially social-democrats who became influenced by 'third way' ideology.
Other leftists believe in Marxian economics, which are based on the economic theories of Karl Marx. Some distinguish Marx's economic theories from his political philosophy, arguing that Marx's approach to understanding the economy is independent of his advocacy of revolutionary socialism or his belief in the inevitability of proletarian revolution.[ref]
