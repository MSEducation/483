CKHJ is a Canadian radio station in Fredericton, New Brunswick broadcasting at 1260 kHz on the AM dial. The station broadcasts a country music format under the "KHJ" branding. CKHJ is owned by Bell Media.

==History==

CKHJ first signed on August 19, 1977 as CIHI. In June 2000 the station swapped frequencies with CIHI (now CFXY), with CIHI assuming the 105.3 frequency and CKHJ moving to 1260. There are two rebroadcasters on FM due to the AM station's weak signal to the south and east of the city: CKHJ-1-FM on 95.1 in New Maryland, and CKHJ-2-FM in 103.5 in Oromocto. All three transmitters can be heard over most of Fredericton, effectively creating a simulcast.Decision CRTC 92-249
CKHJ, along with CIHI, was owned by Radio One Ltd. from its creation until 1999, when they were sold to Telemedia Communications. Telemedia then sold the stations to Astral Media in 2002.
The station's transmitter is on Royal Road, northwest of Fredericton.
On November 27, 2008, CKHJ applied to increase the signal of CKHJ-2-FM Oromocto.Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2008-110Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2008-110-1 The station received approval on January 26, 2009.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2009-32
