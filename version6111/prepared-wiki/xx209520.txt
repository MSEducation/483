==Founder of Bioelectronics in Italy==

Massimo Grattarola thrived at the cutting edge of research. Massimo's ambition was to unite engineers and physicists into neurophysiology and neuroscience... which he christened: Neurobioengineering or Neuroengineering. Mr Grattarola was the only scientist in Italy to have a chair in Bioelectronics for the Biomedical Engineering degree, pioneering the field of Bioelectronics with his textbook publication "Bioelectronics Handbook: MOSFETs, Biosensors and Neurons", edited in 1998 by Mc-Graw Hill.http://www.amazon.com/Bioelectronics-Handbook-MOSFETs-Biosensors-Neurons/dp/0070031746 Massimo then proposed an International Research Center on Neuroengineering in Genova.
His peers described him as a soft-spoken, personable man with an intense mind who: "... transmitted to his students not only his knowledge but also, and even more, his enthusiasm for research and his creative way of doing science."

==Pioneer - First Bio-Artificial Brain==

In September 2001, European Commission appointed Mr Grattarola as an F.E.T. (Future and Emerging Technologies) Programme Project Leader, to study neuronal plasticity at the network level (A Bio-artificial Brain), to train cultured neuronal tissue to support behavior of an artificial body.Institute of Physics, Journal of Neural Engineering Vol 5, Issue 4. http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1741-2552/2/4/E01/jne5_4_e01.pdf?request-id=6f3a87c4-a31f-486e-b2b0-3756a52e060c
