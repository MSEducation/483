Chiloé National Park is a national park of Chile, located in the western coast of Chiloé Island, in Los Lagos Region (region of the lakes). It encompasses an area of [tpl]convert|430.57|sqkm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] divided into two main sectors: the smallest, called Chepu, is in the commune of Ancud, whereas the rest, called Anay, is in the communes of Dalcahue, Castro and Chonchi. The greater portion of the Park is in the foothills of Chilean Coastal Range, known as the Cordillera del Piuchén. It includes zones of dunes, Valdivian temperate rain forests, swamps, and peat bogs.  A small portion, Metalqui, is an islet with an area of [tpl]convert|0.5|sqkm|abbr=on[/tpl].  It is located between 42° 07' and 42° 13' south latitude and between 73° 55' and 74° 09' west longitude (see [tpl]coord|42.10|S|74.02|W[/tpl]).

==History==

The park was created by Supreme Chilean Decree N° 734, in 1982. Its surface area has been reduced by more than [tpl]convert|45|sqkm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] by populated land that was initially in the protected area.

==Climate==

The climate is wet and temperate, with average annual temperatures of [tpl]convert|11|C|0[/tpl] and abundant precipitation distributed uniformly throughout the year, varying according to the altitude. On the Pacific coast over [tpl]convert|3000|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] fall annually, while in the higher elevations of the Piuchén, nearly [tpl]convert|5000|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] fall, and on the rainshadowed eastern slopes, as little as [tpl]convert|2500|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in annual precipitation is measured.

==Flora==

The predominant vegetation is that of the Valdivian forest, a dense forest formed by perennial trees, shrubs and climbing plants. The rainforests are made up of evergreen southern beech (Nothofagus), and some native conifers, including the magnificent alerce (Fitzroya cupressoides). Extensive bogs and swamps are found in the hills. The Chilean rhubarb is also very common.
