WUMB-FM operates as a noncommercial public radio-style station which carries some NPR programming. HD Radio technology allows WUMB to transmit a high-quality digital signal.HD radio page wumb.org 
Due to the crowded state of the noncommercial end of the FM dial in New England, WUMB operates at a modest 160 watts, effectively limiting its coverage area to Boston itself and its innermost suburbs.  To widen its signal, it operates a network of seven repeater stations across eastern Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire. WUMB-FM can also be heard on the Internet at both low bit rate for those with dial up connection and in stereo for those with broadband service. 
Since 1998 WUMB sponsored a live music festival, called the Boston Folk Festival through 2009 but renamed to WUMB Music Fest in 2010 and 2011.  The first festival was held at scattered sites in Boston's Back Bay.  Since then it has taken place on the University of Massachusetts-Boston campus.   The event's future is now in doubt, as the station cancelled the 2012 festival.WUMB Music Fest
Since 2011 the station has carried a portion of the Newport Folk Festival from NPR Music live on its website. In 2012 the coverage began on Saturday, July 28 and will conclude the next day. The audio of the festival is being carried on air and its usual on line audio streams replacing its usual programming. The website still has a page from the 2011 Festival which makes access confusing. The page for the 2012 festival with an embedded player and the schedule is at this url address.
Until 2013, WUMB broadcast with 660 watts, with a height above average terrain of 63 meters; after the station lost its then-transmitter site, the station moved to a new site and began broadcasting with its present 160-watt facility.
