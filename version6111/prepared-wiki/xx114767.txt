Corambis is also the name of a character equivalent to Polonius in the Bad Quarto of Hamlet. It adds to the case that the character of Polonius is based on Lord Burghley whose motto "cor unum" (one heart) is satirised in "corambis" (two hearts, implying "duplicitous").[tpl]cn|date=August 2013[/tpl]
The change in the Hamlet character's name from Corambis to Polonius may be a pun at the expense of a Polish diplomat who insulted and angered Queen Elizabeth.Shiff, Abraham Samuel.
