[[Great Wymondley]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Hertfordshire

Great Wymondley is a village situated near Hitchin in Hertfordshire.  It is dominated by its small Norman church with a large apsidal chancel and 15th century nave roof. There are also earthworks of a former motte-and-bailey castle, and Delamere House, an elegant Elizabethan building.  There are also a number of thatched cottages, including a row of terraced cottages each named after one of King Henry VIII's wives.  Despite the names, Great Wymondley is much smaller than its neighbour, Little Wymondley.
