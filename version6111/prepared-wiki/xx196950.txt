The Grand Prix was a contest between the French Peugeots and the German Mercedes. This was the last Grand Prix before the First World War, and took place less than a week after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. An estimated crowd of over 300,000[ref]

watched thirty-seven cars start in pairs with a thirty-second gap between each pair. Sailer led by 18 seconds at the end of the first lap, and by lap five had built a lead of almost three minutes. Sailer retired with a blown engine on lap six. Georges Boillot took over the lead and retained it for the next twelve laps. At one point he led by over four minutes.
The Mercedes drivers each made one stop during the race for new Continental tyres, regardless of the tyre wear. This contrasted with the poor wear of the Dunlop tyres used by Peugeot[ref]
</ref> and Boillot's eight stops for tyres.<ref name="king"/> Boillot's many stops allowed Lautenschlager to pass Boillot on lap 18. By the end of that lap, Lautenschlager had opened up a lead of over 30 seconds. Boillot dropped out during the final lap.<ref name="teamdan"/><ref name="king"/>
Ferenc Szisz, the winner of the first French Grand Prix in 1906, had to retire from the race through injury.  On the 11th lap Szisz was forced to stop to change a wheel. During the wheel change, he was hit by another car and suffered a broken arm. His mechanic was also injured. This was the last Grand Prix before World War I started, and racing did not resume until 1919.[ref]
