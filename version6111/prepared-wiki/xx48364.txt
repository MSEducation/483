Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) also known as corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) or corticoliberin is a peptide hormone and neurotransmitter involved in the stress response. It belongs to corticotropin-releasing factor family.  In humans, it is encoded by the CRH gene.
Its main function is the stimulation of the pituitary synthesis of ACTH, as part of the HPA Axis.
Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a 41-amino acid peptide derived from a 196-amino acid preprohormone. CRH is secreted by the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus in response to stress. Increased CRH production has been observed to be associated with Alzheimer's disease and major depression,[tpl]cite journal | author = Raadsheer FC, van Heerikhuize JJ, Lucassen PJ, Hoogendijk WJ, Tilders FJ, Swaab DF | title = Corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA levels in the paraventricular nucleus of patients with Alzheimer's disease and depression | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 152 | issue = 9 | pages = 1372–6 |date=September 1995 | pmid = 7653697 | doi = | url = [/tpl] and autosomal recessive hypothalamic corticotropin deficiency has multiple and potentially fatal metabolic consequences including hypoglycemia. In addition to being produced in the hypothalamus, CRH is also synthesized in peripheral tissues, such as T lymphocytes, and is highly expressed in the placenta. In the placenta, CRH is a marker that determines the length of gestation and the timing of parturition and delivery. A rapid increase in circulating levels of CRH occurs at the onset of parturition, suggesting that, in addition to its metabolic functions, CRH may act as a trigger for parturition.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: CRH corticotropin releasing hormone| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=1392| accessdate = [/tpl]

==Hormonal actions==

CRH is produced by parvocellular neuroendocrine cells within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and is released at the median eminence from neurosecretory terminals of these neurons into the primary capillary plexus of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal system. The portal system carries the CRH to the anterior lobe of the pituitary, where it stimulates corticotropes to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and other biologically-active substances (β-endorphin). ACTH stimulates the synthesis of cortisol, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and DHEA.[tpl]cite web|title=Corticotrophin-releasing hormone|url=http://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/corticotrophinreleasing_hormone.aspx|work=September 5, 2012|publisher=Society for Endocrinology[/tpl]
In the short term, CRH can suppress appetite, increase subjective feelings of anxiety, and perform other functions like boosting attention. Although the distal action of CRH is immunosuppression via the action of cortisol, CRH itself can actually heighten inflammation, a process being investigated in multiple sclerosis research.[tpl]cite journal|last=Paul|first=William E.|title=Infectious Diseases and the Immune System|journal=Scientific American|date=September 1993|page=112|bibcode=1993SciAm.269c..90P|volume=269|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0993-90|issue=3[/tpl]

==Psychopharmacology==

The CRH-1 receptor antagonist pexacerfont is currently under 
investigation for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00481325?order=31 | title = Study of Pexacerfont (BMS-562086) in the Treatment of Outpatients With Generalized Anxiety Disorder | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2008-08-01 | format = | work = | publisher = ClinicalTrials.gov | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-08-03[/tpl] Another CRH-1 antagonist antalarmin has been researched in animal studies for the treatment of anxiety, depression and other conditions, but no human trials with this compound have been carried out.
Also, abnormally high levels of CRH have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of people that have committed suicide.[tpl]cite journal |author=Arató M, Bánki CM, Bissette G, Nemeroff CB |title=Elevated CSF CRF in suicide victims |journal=Biol.

Recent research has linked the activation of the CRH1 receptor with the euphoric feelings that accompany alcohol consumption. A CRH1 receptor antagonist developed by Pfizer, CP-154,526 is under investigation for the potential treatment of alcoholism.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080730175518.htm | title = Drug Has Potential To Prevent Alcoholics From Relapsing | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2008-08-02 | work = Science News | publisher = ScienceDaily | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-08-09[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Pastor R, McKinnon CS, Scibelli AC, Burkhart-Kasch S, Reed C, Ryabinin AE, Coste SC, Stenzel-Poore MP, Phillips TJ | title = Corticotropin-releasing factor-1 receptor involvement in behavioral neuroadaptation to ethanol: a urocortin1-independent mechanism | journal = Proc.

==Role in parturition==

CRH is also synthesized by the placenta and seems to determine the duration of pregnancy.[tpl]cite web | url = http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/H/Hypothalamus.html#CRH | title = Hormones of the Hypothalamus | author = Kimball JW | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2006-06-15 | format = | work = Kimball's Biology Pages | publisher = | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-08-03[/tpl]
Levels rise towards the end of pregnancy just before birth and current theory suggests three roles of CRH in parturition:[tpl]cite book | author =  Lye S, Challis JRG | authorlink = | editor = Bocking AD, Harding R | others = | title = Fetal growth and development | edition = | language = | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 2001 | origyear = | chapter = Chapter 12: Parturition | pages = 241–266| quote = | isbn = 0-521-64543-3 | oclc =  | url = | accessdate = [/tpl]
In culture, trophoblast CRH is inhibited by progesterone, which remains high throughout pregnancy. Its release is stimultated by glucocorticoids and catecholamines, which increase prior to parturition lifting this progesterone block.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jones SA, Brooks AN, Challis JR | title = Steroids modulate corticotropin-releasing hormone production in human fetal membranes and placenta | journal = J.

==Structure==

The 41-amino acid sequence of CRH was first discovered in sheep by Vale et al. in 1981.[tpl]cite journal | author = Vale W, Spiess J, Rivier C, Rivier J | title = Characterization of a 41-residue ovine hypothalamic peptide that stimulates secretion of corticotropin and beta-endorphin | journal = Science | volume = 213 | issue = 4514 | pages = 1394–7 |date=September 1981 | pmid = 6267699 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6267699| doi=10.1126/science.6267699[/tpl] Its full sequence is:
The rat and human peptides are identical and differ from the ovine sequence only by 7 amino acids.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chrousos GP, Schuermeyer TH, Doppman J, Oldfield EH, Schulte HM, Gold PW, Loriaux DL | title = NIH conference.

==Role in non-mammalian vertebrates==

In mammals, studies suggest that CRH has no significant thyrotropic effect. However, in representatives of all non-mammalian vertebrates, it has been found that, in addition to its corticotropic function, CRH has a potent thyrotropic function, acting with TRH to control the thyroid axis (TRH has been found to be less potent than CRH in some species).[tpl]cite journal|last=Seasholtz|first=AF|coauthors=Valverde, RA; Denver, RJ|title=Corticotropin-releasing hormone-binding protein: biochemistry and function from fishes to mammals|journal=The Journal of endocrinology|date=October 2002|volume=175|issue=1|pages=89–97|pmid=12379493|doi=10.1677/joe.0.1750089[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=De Groef|first=B|coauthors=Van der Geyten, S; Darras, VM; Kühn, ER|title=Role of corticotropin-releasing hormone as a thyrotropin-releasing factor in non-mammalian vertebrates|journal=General and comparative endocrinology|date=March 2006|volume=146|issue=1|pages=62–8|pmid=16337947|doi=10.1016/j.ygcen.2005.10.014[/tpl]
