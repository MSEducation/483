Matti Taneli Vanhanen ([tpl]Audio|Fi-Matti_Vanhanen.ogg|pronunciation[/tpl]) (born 4 November 1955) is a Finnish politician who was Prime Minister of Finland from 2003 to 2010. He was also Chairman of the Centre Party, and in the second half of 2006 he was President of the European Council. In his earlier career he was a journalist. Vanhanen is the son of professor Tatu Vanhanen and Anni Tiihonen. 

==Career==

Vanhanen studied political science at the University of Helsinki, graduating as a Master of Social Sciences in 1989.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/laitos/alumni/index.htm |title=Yleisen valtio-opin laitos |publisher=Valt.helsinki.fi |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl] He was chairman of the Centre Party Youth League from 1980 to 1983. He also served as a member of the Espoo City Council from 1981 to 1984. Vanhanen used to work as a journalist. He was an editor (1985–1988) and editor-in-chief (1988–1991) at the local newspaper Kehäsanomat. In a column in Suomenmaa (the Centre Party's organ), he strongly condemned the Baltic Star pro-Estonian independence demonstration held in Helsinki in July 1985, calling the demonstration "provocative".Matti Vanhanen, Suomenmaa 30.7.1985 
Vanhanen was elected to the Finnish Parliament (Eduskunta) in 1991. As a member of Parliament he was interested in ecological issues. For instance, Vanhanen spoke against the building of a fifth nuclear power plant in 1992, at the same time as serving on the board of electricity corporation Fortum. He served on the Parliamentary Environment Committee 1991–1995, and was chair of the Parliamentary Grand Committee 2000–2001. He was vice-chair of the Centre Party Parliamentary group 1994–2001, and Deputy Chairman of the Centre Party 2000–2003.
Another important topic for Vanhanen was Finland's foreign and security policy. As a specialist on the European Union he was a member of the European Union Constitutional Convention. There he criticised the president of the convention, former French president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, as authoritarian. Vanhanen has said[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.suomenkuvalehti.fi/?id=5835 |title=Suomenkuvalehti.fi |publisher=Suomenkuvalehti.fi |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl] that he is unenthusiastic about European co-operation, and that he is an "EU pragmatist", so he may be considered a eurosceptic, especially when compared to his EU-enthusiast predecessor Paavo Lipponen.

===Vanhanen's first cabinet===

Vanhanen resigned from the Constitutional Convention in 2003 when he became Minister of Defense in the cabinet of Prime Minister Anneli Jäätteenmäki. After Jäätteenmäki's resignation, Vanhanen was elected Prime Minister and his first cabinet was formed.
As a politician, Vanhanen is considered to be part of the liberal wing of the old agrarian Central Party, along with the two other Party ministers from Uusimaa region. His government cut the top state income tax rate from 35.5% to 33.5% in 2005 and 32.5% in 2006 (resulting in approximately 55% total tax rate after local government and social security taxes). The corporate tax rate was also lowered to 26% and capital gains to 28% (both formerly 29%), though at the same time dividends were partially made taxable. Vanhanen has said he is willing to continue tax cuts.

===Presidential candidate===

As the Centre Party candidate, Vanhanen challenged President Tarja Halonen in the 2006 Finnish presidential election. He received 18.6% of the vote, coming third to the National Coalition Party's Sauli Niinistö (24.1%) and Social Democrat and incumbent Tarja Halonen (46.3%), and thus did not qualify for the runoff. Vanhanen expressed his support for Niinistö in the runoff election against his coalition partner's candidate Halonen.
The presidential election, and co-operation between Centre Party and National Coalition Party, proved to be a major strain on the government coalition between the Centre Party and Social Democrats. The flashpoint came in March, when the Centre Party demanded national agricultural subsidies to cover farmers' losses when the Finnish exception in the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy was about to expire. At the end of the crisis Vanhanen told his parliamentary group that taxpayers would cover ninety percent or about 100 million euros in losses.

===Vanhanen's second cabinet===

After the March 2007 election the Centre Party narrowly remained the largest party after losing four seats. However their coalition partner, the SDP, lost eight seats and the centre-right National Coalition Party gained ten. Vanhanen's second cabinet was formed on a centre-right basis, with minor partners the Green League and the Swedish People's Party.
A scandal involving Vanhanen's second cabinet began rolling in May 2008, after the leader of the Centre Party's parliamentary group Timo Kalli said publicly that he would not reveal information about his campaign finances, because such disclosure was not required. After a media backlash, Kalli gave up his secrecy and listed a group of businessmen known as "Kehittyvien maakuntien Suomi" (KMS; in English, "The Finland of Developing Regions"), who had financed the Centre Party. Centre Party links with KMS were suspected, as one address of the organisation belonged to a party official. It was later revealed that the organisation had been formed in the Centre Party's general secretary's office.
After the Russian response to the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia, Vanhanen said that Finland would rethink its security.[tpl]cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2008/08/vanhanen_finland_to_rethink_security_following_crisis_in_georgia_314968.html |title=Vanhanen: Finland to Rethink Security Following Crisis in Georgia |publisher=Yle.fi |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl]
Vanhanen has proposed raising the retirement age from the current 63 to 65 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/200902289164604_uu.shtml |title=Vanhanen: Eläkeiän korotus lähti minun aloitteestani |publisher=Iltalehti.fi |date=28 February 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/kotimaa.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2009/02/818706 |title=Vanhanen: Eläkeiän nostolla maksetaan laman laskut |publisher=Mtv3.fi |date=25 February 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2009/03/pm_vanhanen_quotnecessary_to_raise_pension_age_598142.html |title=PM Vanhanen: "Necessary to Raise Pension Age" |publisher=Yle.fi |date=8 March 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl] His proposal was fiercely opposed by the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (Finnish acronym SAK), which is affiliated with the SDP.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taloussanomat.fi/tyomarkkinat/2009/03/02/sak--uhkaa-katkaista-valit-hallitukseen/20095555/12 |title=SAK uhkaa katkaista välit hallitukseen |publisher=Taloussanomat.fi |date=3 February 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl]
In 2010, the Finnish police investigated whether Vanhanen had been wrong not to disqualify himself in certain cabinet decisions on financial contributions to an organisation affiliated with the Centre Party, which had previously financed Vanhanen's presidential campaign. Because the charges concerned Vanhanen's actions while in office, the decision whether he should be prosecuted fell to the Constitutional Law Committee of the Finnish Parliament. The Committee decided not to prosecute Vanhanen.

==Personality==

Vanhanen has been characterised as uncharismatic and even boring, which he has attempted to turn to his advantage in tense political situations. Vanhanen is known for being an teetotaler, saying that he does not like the taste of alcohol.[tpl]cite web|author=taz, die tageszeitung |url=http://www.taz.de/pt/2003/06/25/a0148.nf/text |title=Archiv |publisher=taz.de |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl] He has been quoted as denying ever taking advice from other persons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.anta.net/2008/05/30/five-advisors-zero-advice/ |title=/ Five advisors, zero advice? |publisher=Blog.anta.net |date=30 May 2008 |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl]
Matti Vanhanen was against the independence movement in the Baltic States during the 1980s. In his column in Suomenmaa in 1985, Vanhanen condemned the Baltic independence movement both for "wishing to change the Soviet system" and for "indifference towards the post Second World War reality." Vanhanen claimed that the difference between capitalism and socialism was not significant; and that instead of being concerned about the Soviet system, it would be better to concentrate, for example, on the research of Finno-Ugric languages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kavkaz.fi/vanhanen.html |title=Matti Vanhanen, Suomenmaa 30.7.1985 |publisher=Kavkaz.fi |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl]
In 2009, he visited China and credited the government for being systematic, as well as being able to place clear priorities and to mobilise the required resources to accomplish them. In his opinion, the Western world ought to note the example of China, where policies are implemented rapidly and effectively.[tpl]cite web|author=Petteri Tuohinen |url=http://www.hs.fi/artikkeli/Vanhanen+L%C3%A4nsimaat+voisivat+ottaa+oppia+Kiinasta+tehokkuudessa/1135245327236 |title=Petteri Tuohinen ‘Vanhanen: Lansimaat voisivat ottaa oppia Kiinan tehokkuudesta’ Helsingin Sanomat 21.4.2009 |publisher=Hs.fi |date=21 April 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl] He said he was impressed of the progress the country has made in dealing with difficult issues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/China+smothers+Vanhanen+in+cordial+language/1135219742524 |title=China smothers Vanhanen in cordial language 29.4.2009 |publisher=Hs.fi |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl]
Vanhanen married Merja Vanhanen in 1985. They have two children: Annastiina (born 1991) and Juhana (born 1994).

After his divorce, Susan Kuronen (she later changed her last name to Ruusunen) was widely linked to Vanhanen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/viihde/200607314940634_vi.shtml |title=Viihde | 01.08.2006 | Matti Vanhanen ja Susan viihtyvät yhdessä |publisher=Iltalehti.fi |date=8 January 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl] but their relationship broke down.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Susan+speaks+now+-+but+not+in+an+exclusive+interview/1135223472440 |title=Helsingin Sanomat – International Edition – People |publisher=Hs.fi |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl] In February 2007, Kuronen released a tell-all book The Prime Minister's Bride, which actually boosted the prime minister's popularity with the public. Tens of thousands of Finns signed an online petition against the book and some bookstores refused to put it on the shelf.http://apnews.myway.com/article/20070315/D8NSNU780.html Vanhanen sued Kuronen for invasion of privacy in March 2007, following the March elections. In 2010 the Supreme Court of Finland upheld the privacy violation conviction against Susan Ruusunen and her publisher.Supreme Court upholds privacy violation conviction against Susan Ruusunen and publisher for kiss-and-tell book

==Campaign funds==

Matti Vanhanen received 25,000 euros for his presidential election campaign in 2006 from Ahti Vilppula via his company Helsingin Mekaanikkotalo.

==Youth Foundation==

Vanhanen served as Chairman of the Youth Foundation from 1998 to 2003 and Deputy chairman from 1981 to 1997. The prosecution claims the Youth Foundation donated under the direction of Centre Party MP Antti Kaikkonen funding of over 90,000 euros for his own campaign and that of other Centre Party MPs including Matti Vanhanen. Prosecutors say this contravened the Foundation's own rules and laws governing such institutions.Vanhanen: No talk of campaign funding in Youth Foundation, Former Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen took the witness stand today in the trial of former leaders of the Youth Foundation yle 10 October 2012
