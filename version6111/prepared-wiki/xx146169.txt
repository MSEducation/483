==History==

Construction of the Deep Water Harbour began in 1956 by Costain Group of Britain,Deep Water at Bridgetown - Film by Richard Costain Ltd British Film Institute, 1961 and cost EC$28,000,000 through completion in 1961.   The port was formed by creating a man-made isthmus across the shallow strait that existed off the coast of Fontabelle, St. Michael.   The isthmus formed 90 acres of new land stretching from the original west coast of Barbados, out to a small uninhabited, ex-quarantine island just offshore, named Pelican Island.   After the initial completion, the harbour later underwent a $22 million expansion seventeen years later.CHAPTER 67A DEEP WATER HARBOUR (EXPANSION AND IMPROVEMENT) - Prior expansion 1978
In 2002 Barbados Port Inc. contracted with Jan De Nul Group of Companies of Belgium to carry out dredging at the port facility.  The dredging was deemed necessary to allow some of the world's largest cruise ships to berth in Barbados rather than anchoring offshore.  The project followed a rigorous environmental monitoring programme by the Barbados Port Inc. along with key regulatory agencies, namely the Town Planning Department, the Coastal Zone Management Unit, the Environmental Engineering Division and the University of the West Indies' Natural Resources Management Programme to ensure that the oceanographic and sediment processes, the water quality, and the marine communities were not compromised in any way.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.barbadosport.com/html/cargo.html |title=Cruise and Cargo Facilities |first= |last= |author=Staff writer |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=Unk |work= |publisher=Barbados Port Inc. |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=[/tpl] During this operation, the port's depth was increased to 11.6 metres (from 9.6 metres). Reclaimed material from the dredging was added to increase the port's cargo area by 9 acres.Barbados Port Inc: Cruise and Cargo Facilities
In December 2008, Minister of International Transport George Hutson announced that due to congestion between cargo and passenger ships at the Deep Water Harbour, the country needed to look at expansion at the facility following the last upgrade undertaken in 2002. Due to the importance of Tourism to Barbados' economy, the government is presently reviewing a further $70 million upgrade.[tpl]cite news |title=$70m cruise plan |author= |first=Ricky |last=Jordan |authorlink= |url=http://www.nationnews.com/news/local/LEAD-port-venture-FRONT-PAGE-LEAD |format= |agency= |newspaper=Nation Newspaper |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=2009-11-25 |page= |pages= |accessdate= |trans_title= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |ref= [/tpl]

In 2012 the Government of Barbados announced http://www.gisbarbados.gov.bb/index.php?categoryid=13&p2_articleid=8988 the desire to establish a new separate Cruise terminal just to south along the Princess Alice Highway.http://www.ship-technology.com/news/newsbarbados-to-build-new-cruise-terminal-in-bridgetownhttp://www.caribbean360.com/index.php/business/615720.htmlhttp://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/cruise-boost1/ As advisors to the Government, Royal Caribbean and STI were selected to work with the government http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/smi-also-gets-320m-project/http://www.travelpulse.com/rccl-partners-with-barbados-on-new-cruise-terminal.html on  the project to be called The Sugar Point Cruise Developmenthttp://www.caribbeannewsreview.com/index.php/caribbean1/news/570-new-cruise-facility-to-bring-new-opportunities-for-barbados' or The Sugar Point Cruise Terminal. The facility will function as a means to separate cruise-traffic to the country from the containerised-traffic which will remain at the Deep Water Harbour.  The move should help to mitigate delays which effect container-ships to Bridgetown which at times must have idle offshore for Cruise ships to make available a berth as cruise ships are given preference at the Harbour.http://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/no.13.pdf  The first phase of the new terminal is expected to cost in the region of BDS$300 million, and dredge work is planned by the administration to begin in November 2012.http://www.thecaribbeancurrent.com/barbados-to-get-an-ultra-modern-cruise-ship-terminal/http://www.caribbeannewsreview.com/index.php/caribbean1/news/570-new-cruise-facility-to-bring-new-opportunities-for-barbados
