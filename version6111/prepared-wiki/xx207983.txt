Speaking of the album, McCusker notes that their "paths had all crossed in various ways over the past few years - working with Kate Rusby, and on Kris and Roddy's solo albums - and our starting-point was basically just that we all really liked each other's stuff."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drevermccuskerwoomble.com/press.html |title=Press Page - Kris Drever John McCusker Roddy Woomble - Before the Ruin |publisher=Drevermccuskerwoomble.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-15[/tpl] Woomble notes that: "Kris and John each have such a different take on things like melody and lyrics, but we’re all working equally on the songs together, so the whole thing feels totally new. And it’s great getting to make another ‘first’ album at our age."

The album cover is by Orcadian painter Charles Shearer, and is said to "describe the physical, and metaphorical pull of the ocean, which is also a main theme of the record."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roddywoomble.com/news |title=Latest News |publisher=Roddy Woomble |date= |accessdate=2012-01-15[/tpl]
