The National Football League Most Valuable Player Award (NFL MVP) is an award given by various entities to the American football offensive player who is considered most valuable to his team in the National Football League.

==Associated Press NFL POY/MVP Award==

The AP NFL MVP award is voted upon by sportswriters at the end of the regular season, before the playoffs, though the results are not announced to the public until the day before the Super Bowl.
The award has been shared twice, in 1997 and 2003.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20040103/ai_n11433096?tag=content;col1|title=Colts' Manning, Titans' McNair share honor|last=Wilner|first=Brody McCrary|date=January 3, 2004|work=Deseret News (Salt Lake City)|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2009-01-02[/tpl] Peyton Manning has won the award five times, the most of any player. Jim Brown, Johnny Unitas, and Brett Favre were named MVP three times, while Joe Montana, Steve Young, Kurt Warner, and Tom Brady have each won the award twice. Favre is the only player to win the award three consecutive years, and Brady is the only player to ever be voted unanimously (2010). Most awardees have been quarterbacks and running backs; the only defensive players to be so honored have been Alan Page and Lawrence Taylor, and the only special teams player was Mark Moseley.

===Confusion===

On January 1, 2008, the AP stated that it awarded its first MVP in 1961.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80dd272c&template=with-video-with-comments&confirm=true |title=Third time's a charm: Colts QB Manning again wins NFL MVP award |work=NFL.com |agency=Associated Press |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=January 4, 2009[/tpl] It is possible that this is a reaction to an article in Pro Football Weekly[tpl]cite web|first=John |last=Turney |url=http://www.profootballweekly.com/PFW/Commentary/Columns/2008/turney122208.htm |title=Correcting the Record of the 'NFL Record & Fact Book' |work=Pro Football Weekly |publisher=Primedia |date=December 22, 2008 |accessdate=January 4, 2009[/tpl] that suggests the AP's listing of its awards was incorrect. As recently as the morning (EST) of the same date,[tpl]cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com:80/espn/wire?section=nfl&id=3805671 |title=National Football League MVPs |work=ESPN.com |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Disney Company |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=January 4, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Barry |last=Wilner |url=http://www.pjstar.com/sports/x497775193/Manning-named-NFL-MVP-for-record-third-time |title=Three-time MVP in NFL now a party for two |agency=Associated Press |work=Pjstar.com: Peoria Journal Star website |publisher= GateHouse Media |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=January 4, 2009[/tpl] the AP's web site listed the 1957 MVP as Jim Brown, the 1958 MVP as Gino Marchetti, the 1959 MVP as Charlie Conerly, and the 1960 co-MVPs as Norm Van Brocklin and Joe Schmidt. The Pro Football Weekly.com article disputes the 1958, 1959, and 1960 winners. Since, as the PFW article points out, the AP began using the term "MVP" in 1961, it seems the pre-1960 winners are no longer considered "MVPs" but "Players of the Year." Adding to the confusion, the 1962 winner, Jim Taylor (in the story that moved across the AP wire in 1962) was the "Player of the Year", not the "Most Valuable Player." In 1963 the term "MVP" was used once again. According to another article by Pro Football Weekly, the terms "Player of the Year" and "Most Valuable Player" were interchangeable at the time.[tpl]cite web|first=John |last=Turney |url=http://www.profootballweekly.com/2010/01/11/ap-gets-it-partially-right-2 |title=AP gets it partially right |work=Pro Football Weekly |publisher=Primedia |date=January 11, 2010 |accessdate=January 22, 2010[/tpl]
