The Web magazine, which was hosting the awards, was closed down by its parent company IDG shortly before the awards, and the ceremony continued thereafter under the management of Tiffany Shlain, who IDG had hired in 1996 to coordinate the awards.  The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences was constituted that year as the judging panel for the awards, continues to do so as of the 2007 awards.

==1999==

The 1999 Webby Awards were held on March 18, 1999 at the Herbst Theater (War memorial Opera House) in San Francisco, with a post-award party at City Hall.  That year, Mayor Rudy Giuliani lobbied to move the ceremony to New York City, but San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown convinced the organization to remain in San Francisco by promising city support.  The event was noted for the famous incident in which a representative of Jodi.org, which had won in the arts category, called the event participants "Ugly corporate sons-of-bitches" in his acceptance speech and tossed his trophy to the audience.[tpl]cite news|publisher=Computergram International|title=Usual Suspects Takes Webbies in Five Words or Less|date=Marcy 22, 1999|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CGN/is_1999_March_22/ai_54170019| author=Rachel Chalmers [/tpl]  In 1999 the Webby Awards asked PricewaterhouseCoopers to help it tabulate and ensure security for the "People's Voice" winners, chosen by online voting.[tpl]cite news|title=PricewaterhouseCoopers Address On-Line Balloting Issues for Webby Awards|publisher=Business Wire|date=March 17, 1999|accessdate=2008-01-03|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1999_March_17/ai_54127102[/tpl]

==Notes==

In keeping with the awards themselves, winners are designated according to the website winning the award, although the winner is, technically, the web design firm that created the winning site and in the case of corporate websites, the designer's client.  Web links are provided for informational purposes where the winning website or a follow-on remains available and can be found; the text used for the hyperlink is as listed on the past winner pages at http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/winners-1997.php and so on.  Many older websites, however, no longer exist or are redirected to replacements and are so noted.
