The Republic of Texas is a general term for several organizations, some of which have been called militia groups,[tpl]cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Bruce |title=Inside terrorism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RSzyEx4do48C|year=2006|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-12699-1|pages=105[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Edwards|first=Thomas|title=Secessionists change legal strategy - 2 militia members decide to stop own defense, rehire appointed attorneys|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SAEC&p_theme=saec&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAFE8011B8C3263&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |newspaper=San Antonio Express-News|date=31 Oct 1997[/tpl]See footnote 1, McLaren v.

The issue of the legal status of Texas led the group to claim to have reinstated a provisional government on December 13, 1995. Activists within the movement claim over 40,000 active supporters. There is, however, no widespread popular support for an independent Texas.[tpl]cite web |title=In Texas, 31% Say State Has Right to Secede From U.S., But 75% Opt To Stay |publisher=Rasmussen Reports |accessdate=2009-04-17 |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/states_general/texas/in_texas_31_say_state_has_right_to_secede_from_u_s_but_75_opt_to_stay[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The movement for independence was started by Richard Lance (Rick) McLaren. McLaren concluded that, in 1861, Texans voted four-to-one to leave the Union. According to McLaren, Texas met the qualifications, under international law, of a captive nation of war, since the end of the American Civil War in 1865.
The movement split into three factions in 1996, one led by McLaren, one by David Johnson and Jesse Enloe, and the third by Archie Lowe and Daniel Miller. In 1997, McLaren and his followers kidnapped Joe and Margaret Ann Rowe, held them hostage at the Fort Davis Resort, and demanded the release of a movement member in exchange for the release of the Rowes.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-04-29/news/9704290127_1_margaret-ann-rowe-republic-members-standoff-ends |title=Texas Separatists Call For Help |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=April 29, 1997 |accessdate=2011-07-19[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Separatists end standoff peacefully|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/republic/republic6.html|accessdate=1 April 2012|newspaper=The Dallas Morning News|date=4 May 1997|author=George Kuempel[/tpl] McLaren's wife, Evelyn, convinced him to surrender peacefully after a week-long standoff with police and Texas Rangers. McLaren and four other Republic of Texas members were sent to prison.McLaren is imprisoned at the William P. Clements unit at Amarillo, Texas. McLaren's projected prison release date is June 15, 2041, when he would be 87 years old. See generally Texas Dep't of Crim.

McLaren was also convicted of federal mail fraud and bank fraud in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas in Dallas. See generally footnote 1, McLaren v.

Two other members of the group, Richard F. Keyes III and Mike Matson managed to slip away. Matson was shot dead by Texas Rangers two days later, while Keyes surrendered to the authorities on September 19. In June 1998, Keyes was convicted of burglary with intent to commit aggravated assault and sentenced to 90 years in prison."Republic of Texas member convicted, sentenced to 90 years" Associated Press, June 20 1998 This effectively destroyed the McLaren faction, and the Johnson-Enloe faction was discredited after two of its members, Jack Abbot Grebe Jr. and Johnie Wise, were convicted in 1998 of threatening to assassinate several government officials, including President Bill Clinton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data_collections/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=95|title=Terrorist Organization Profile: Republic of Texas (RoT) |publisher=start.umd.edu[/tpl]
In 2003, what remained of the movement consolidated into one dominant group recognizing an "interim" government (which replaced the "provisional" government), headed by Daniel Miller. This interim government claimed authority from the original proclamations of 1995 and set up a headquarters in the town of Overton. The movement split again over legal arguments, resulting in the current state of affairs. Most of the original personalities of the movement have disappeared from public view. The organization's finances have come from donations and the sale of some items such as a Republic of Texas Passport. The Republic of Texas headquarters in Overton, Texas burned down on August 31, 2005; one person was moderately injured.Headquarters fire Associated Press, November 1, 2005, Retrieved 2011-07-20
In January 2004, a man in jail in Aspen, Colorado claimed that the state of Colorado had no jurisdiction to extradite him to California on a probation warrant, on the grounds that he was a citizen of the Republic of Texas.  He claimed that the sliver of land which contains Aspen was a part of the original Republic of Texas and, as such, he was not a citizen of the United States. His claim was rejected by the courts.Sheperd, (January 21, 2004). Weird News. The Anchorage Press, Vol. 13, Ed. 2
In a case involving Richard McLaren and his wife Evelyn as plaintiffs, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled, on April 30, 1998: "Despite plaintiffs' argument ..... in 1845, Texas became the 28th state of the United States of America. The Republic of Texas no longer exists".McLaren v. United States Incorporated, 2 F.
