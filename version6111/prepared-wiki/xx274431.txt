Sint Servaasbrug (or the St. Servatius Bridge) is an arched stone footbridge across the Meuse River in Maastricht, Netherlands. It is named after Saint Servatius, the first bishop of Maastricht, and (despite being largely rebuilt after World War II) it has been called the oldest bridge in the Netherlands.[tpl]citation|title=Silk Parachute|first=John|last=McPhee|authorlink=John McPhee|publisher=Macmillan|year=2010|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2jeOwWCHOmYC&pg=PA25|page=25|isbn=0-374-26373-6[/tpl].

==Description==

The Sint Servaasbrug connects pedestrian traffic from the Binnenstad district of Maastricht on the west bank of the Meuse to the Wyck district on the east bank.[tpl]citation|title=Stadswandelingen Nederland|first=M.|last=Meijer|publisher=ANWB Media - Boeken & Gidsen|year=2007|isbn=978-90-18-02554-0|page=94|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UmIet6W9OrYC&pg=PA94[/tpl].
The bridge is made of limestone, and in its current configuration it is [tpl]convert|160|m|ft|0[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|9|m|ft|0[/tpl] wide. Its seven arches each span approximately [tpl]convert|12|m|ft|0[/tpl], and are supported by seven piers.[tpl]citation|url=http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?id=s0005625|title=Sint Servaasbrug|publisher=Structurae[/tpl]. A separate steel drawbridge with a span of [tpl]convert|54.5|m|ftin[/tpl] connects the east end of the bridge to the east bank of the river.

==History==

The Romans built a wooden bridge across the Meuse in what is now Maastricht, in approximately AD 50,[tpl]citation|title=Plants and Habitats of European Cities|first1=Norbert|last1=Müller|first2=John G.|last2=Kelcey|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-0-387-89683-0|page=240|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lUA-LzswzNsC&pg=PA240[/tpl]. and the Latin phrase for "crossing of the Meuse", "mosae trajectum", became the name of the city. For many years this remained the only crossing of the lower Meuse.[tpl]citation|title=The Low Countries: arts and society in Flanders and the Netherlands, Volume 9|publisher=Stichting Ons Erfdeel|year=2001|page=223[/tpl]. However, the Roman bridge collapsed in the year 1275 from the weight of a large procession, killing 400 people.[tpl]citation|title=Christendom and Christianity in the Middle Ages: The Relations Between Religion, Church, and Society|first=Adriaan H.|last=Bredero|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8028-4992-2|page=352|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CD-2apInJSYC&pg=PA352[/tpl].[tpl]citation|title=Romanesque sculpture in Maastricht|first=E.|last=den Hartog|publisher=Bonnefantenmuseum|year=2002|isbn=978-90-72251-31-2|page=139[/tpl]. Its replacement, the present bridge, was built somewhat to the north of the older crossing between 1280 and 1298;[tpl]citation|title=Le Petit Futé Amsterdam Pays-Bas|first=Dominique|last=Auzias|publisher=Petit Futé|year=2011|isbn=978-2-7469-3120-6|page=453|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3ZVeAXAVBfMC&pg=PA453[/tpl]. the Catholic church encouraged its construction by providing indulgences to people who helped build it.
The bridge was renovated in 1680, and in 1825 a wooden strutwork section on the east side of the bridge was replaced by a stone arch.[tpl]citation|title=St. Serveasbrug Maastricht|url=http://www.bruggenstichting.nl/BruggenDB/nbs.asp?id=64&data1=&data2=&mode=ShowRecord|publisher=Nederlandse Bruggen Stichting[/tpl]. In 1850, as part of the construction of the Maastricht-Liège Canal, a channel was cut on the west side of the bridge.
When in the early 1930s the bridge had been relieved of its function as the city's only river crossing by the construction of the Wilhelmina bridge, [tpl]convert|300|m|ft|-2[/tpl] downstream, a major renovation was performed. The arches were reconstructed in concrete, covered with the original stones. Underwater, counter-arches were constructed to prevent erosion of the river bed on which the bridge was built. Two arches on the eastern end of the bridge were removed and replaced by a vertical-lift bridge. Between the two bridges, on the eastern side of the river, a levee was built to separate the navigable eastern channel from the rest of the river.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
During World War II the bridge was severely damaged by the German army as they retreated from the Netherlands in 1944, but it was rebuilt in 1948.[tpl]citation|title=Frommer's Belgium, Holland & Luxembourg|first=George|last=McDonald|edition=11th|publisher=Frommer's|year=2009|isbn=978-0-470-38227-1|page=466|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pTZJUc-TP9MC&pg=PA466[/tpl]. In 1962, the shipping channel to the east of the bridge was spanned by a steel drawbridge attached to the main bridge.[tpl]citation|url=http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?id=s0024716|title=Sint Servaas Lift Bridge|publisher=Structurae[/tpl].
In 1968 the bridge was illustrated on a Dutch postage stamp.[tpl]citation|title=Stamps in the News|first=Syd|last=Kronish|journal=The Victoria Advocate|date=May 19, 1968|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bAVaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=O0sNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1290,4178972[/tpl].
