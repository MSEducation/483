Ronald Oldham Doig (10 July 1909 â€“ 17 September 1932) was an Australian sportsman who played Australian rules football for South Fremantle in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and first-class cricket with Western Australia.
A member of the famous Doig family of Fremantle, Ron was a first cousin of George Doig. He made his debut for South Fremantle at the age of just 17 in 1927 and by 1930 was representing Western Australia at interstate football. He was captain of South Fremantle in 1931 and captain-coach in 1932.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32535988 |title=Death of R O Doig.

On the cricket field, Doig was a right-arm fast-medium bowler and right-handed batsman. He made three first-class cricket appearances for Western Australia, the first of which came in 1926/27 against South Australia. Doig didn't bowl and instead played as a top order batsman, making scores of eight and five.

He had to wait until 1931 to play again at first-class level, with his opportunity coming when South Africa toured. Batting at four, he failed to impress with the bat but took what would be the only wicket of his career, bowling opener Herbie Taylor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/14/14098.html|title=Western Australia v South Africans 1931/32| publisher=CricketArchive[/tpl] When South Africa returned to Perth five months later, Doig made his only other first-class appearance but didn't have an impact on the game.
In the finals of the 1932 WAFL season, Doig, who was now captain-coach of South Fremantle, was seriously injured in a match against East Perth. He died from his injuries.
