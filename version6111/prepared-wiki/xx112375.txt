Vorort is a German term that could be considered roughly equivalent to a suburb. Vororte usually have their own business centre. They are the remainders of formerly separate neighbour towns, or have been founded as satellite towns. The term is contrasted with Vorstadt, which describes a more densely populated area grown at the outline of a city centre.

==Vienna==

In Vienna, the historical terms Vorstädte and Vororte have very specific meanings. The Vorstädte were located outside the city walls, but within the Linienwall, a second ring of fortifications outside the city. The city walls were located in the place of the modern Ringstraße, while the Linienwall has been removed to give way to the Gürtel (both being rings of streets around the central city). All of the historical municipalities were merged into Vienna during the late 19th century. The former Vororte, which have in large parts become as urban as the Vorstädte, now make up Vienna's so-called outer districts (10th to 19th and 21st to 23rd district).
