==L. Ron Hubbard biography==

In the 1980s Miller spent two years researching Bare-faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard, a posthumous biography of the science-fiction author who had founded Scientology. The book challenges the official account of Hubbard's life and work promoted by the Church of Scientology and it was serialised in the Sunday Times.
While researching the book in the United States, Miller was spied upon. His friends and business associates also received visits from Scientologists and private detectives. Attempts were made to frame him for the murder of a London private detective, the murder of American singer Dean Reed in East Berlin and a fire in an aircraft factory.[tpl]cite news|first=Richard |last=Palmer |title=Cult threatens to sue on book|work= Sunday Times |date=November 1, 1987[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|first=Robert W. |last=Welkos |title=Shudder into silence: The Church of Scientology doesn't take kindly to negative coverage| journal=The Quill |date=November–December 1991|publisher=Society of Professional Journalists|pages=36–38[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Margarette|last=Driscoll |coauthor= Steven Haynes |title=Hounded by the church of stars and hype |work= Sunday Times |date=January 19, 1997[/tpl] Senior executives at publishers Michael Joseph, and at the Sunday Times, which serialised the book, received threatening phone calls and also a visit from private investigator Eugene Ingram, who worked for the Church.[tpl]cite news|title=Scientologists In Dirty Campaign To Stop Book|work= Sunday Times |date=October 18, 1987 | page=7[/tpl] Another private investigator, Jarl Grieve Einar Cynewulf, told Sunday Times journalists that he had been offered "large sums of money" to find a link between Miller and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).[tpl]cite news|last=Richard |first=Palmer |title=Cult's private detective fires at journalists |work=Sunday Times |date=November 8, 1987[/tpl]
