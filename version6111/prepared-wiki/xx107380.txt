CATEGORIES: Cooking utensils

A cookie press is a device for making pressed cookies such as spritzgebäck. It consists of a cylinder with a plunger on one end which is used to extrude cookie dough through a small hole at the other end. Typically the cookie press has interchangeable perforated plates with holes in different shapes, such as a star shape or a narrow slit to extrude the dough in ribbons.[tpl]cite book|author=Diane Roupe|title=The Blue Ribbon Country Cookbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mugDh5HTaCQC&pg=PA570|accessdate=19 April 2012|year=2007|publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc|isbn=978-1-4016-0360-1|pages=570–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=Pippa Cuthbert|author2=Lindsay Cameron Wilson|title=Cookies!|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kBv0R-Aqv80C&pg=PA23|accessdate=19 April 2012|date=March 2007|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=978-1-84537-681-9|page=23[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Julia M.
