Grose River, a perennial river that is part of the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment, is located in the Blue Mountains region of New South Wales, Australia.

==Course and features==

Grose River rises east of Mount Victoria below Hartley Vale, within the Blue Mountains National Park, and flows through the Grose Valley and parts of the Greater Blue Mountains Area World Heritage Site, generally north, southeast, then east, joined by four tributaries, before reaching its confluence with the Hawkesbury River west of Agnes Banks. The river descends [tpl]convert|952|m[/tpl] over its [tpl]convert|54|km[/tpl] course.
Hiking is a popular activity and the best access method to the Grose River in its upper reaches. There are several well maintained walks that follow scenic sections of the river valley. One of the most popular is through the Blue Gum Forest,[tpl]cite book |title=Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks |first=Neil |last=Paton |publisher=Kangaroo Press |year=2004 |page=264 |isbn=[/tpl] located at the junction of the Grose River and Govetts Creek.
The river was named in September 1793 in honour of Lieutenant Governor Francis Grose.

==Grose Valley==

The Grose Valley is a rugged valley, formed by the Grose River, the headwaters of which are in the Mount Victoria area. The valley is located between the Great Western Highway and Bells Line of Road, the two major routes across the Blue Mountains. The majority of the valley falls within the Blue Mountains National Park. The valley is popular for bushwalking and contains extensive wilderness areas. The river flows to the Nepean-Hawkesbury through an undisturbed environment for all but its final [tpl]convert|5|km[/tpl]. Consequently the Grose has substantial wild river values, as do its major tributaries such as Wentworth Creek and Carmarthen Brook.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.colongwilderness.org.au/archive/RedIndex/NSW/grose99.htm |title=Grose |work=NSW Wilderness Index |publisher=Colong Foundation for Wilderness |year=1999 |accessdate=24 December 2013 [/tpl] The river is known habitat for platypus and certain hanging swamps provide habitat for the endangered and endemic Blue Mountains Water Skink (Eulamprus leuraensis). The rocky sandstone complexes of the plateau provide habitat for some specialised and rare native animal species (e.g. the Broad-headed Snake Hoplocephalus bungaroides). Woodland communities are habitat for mammals such as the Red-necked swamp wallaby, Brush-tailed rock wallaby and Eastern pygmy possum.
