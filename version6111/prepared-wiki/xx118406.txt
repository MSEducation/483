[[Whitewater Lake]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Greater Sudbury

Whitewater Lake is a lake in the city of Sudbury, Ontario. The community of Azilda borders its eastern shore.
The lake is host to a number of amateur fishing tournaments, and it was the site of an annual powerboat racing championship. It is the site of the Sudbury/Azilda Water Aerodrome, which supports a number of aircraft capable of landing on water. During the winter months, a village of ice huts forms on the lake near Azilda's Centennial Park.
Most of the lake is less than [tpl]convert|1.5|m|abbr=on[/tpl] deep (and dangerous for boaters who are unfamiliar with it). Its maximum depth is [tpl]convert|11|m|abbr=on[/tpl].
