A committee (or "commission") is a type of small deliberative assembly that is usually intended to remain subordinate to another, larger deliberative assembly—which when organized so that action on committee requires a vote by all its entitled members, is called the "Committee of the Whole".  Committees often serve several different functions:

==Procedures==

==Subcommittees==

A committee that is a subset of a larger committee is called a subcommittee.
Where the larger group has a name other than "committee" - for example, "Board" or "Commission", the smaller group(s) would usually be called committee(s), not subcommittee(s), and might go by an entirely different name, or substitute "Commission" for "Committee". For example in the sciences, the "International Commission on Stratigraphy" (ICS) a standing working committee is doing organizational work establishing uniform naming and benchmarks in the geologic record and timeline since 1974, all under the auspices of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). It is technically the "International Stratigraphy Committee" (ISC), which has limited executive committee powers to impanel other subcommittees (also called commissions) to resolve certain matters involving the Geologic time scale—its deliberations and those of its subcommittees must be adopted by the IUGS which meets in a committee-of-the-whole or Congress, every four years or so to deliberate on the subcommittee recommendations and officially adopt or not-adopt such.
From the foregoing, it can easily be seen subcommittees can generally be classified further by the adjectives: "Executive", "Standing",  and "Working":

===Executive committees===

A subcommittee which has well defined executive powers usually spelled out in the charter or by-laws and which meets frequently to manage the affairs and further the purposes of an organization or entity. These are commonly empanelled as well when an organization has a large Board of Directors such as an international labor union, large corporations (with thousands of stock holders) or national and international organizations. A Board of directors is itself a kind of Executive committee established by the charter and by-laws of the entity and elected by the overall franchised membership. For organizations where the Board of Directors is large - say 20 people or more - it is common to have an Executive Committee of the Board—an executive subcommittee of Board members, which is authorized to make some decisions on behalf of the entire Board.

===Standing committees===

A committee established by an official and providing for its scope and powers. Most governmental legislative subcommittees are standing committees, which by another name is a permanent committee. Standing committees meet on a regular or irregular basis dependent upon their enabling act, and retain any power or oversight claims originally given them until subsequent official actions of the committee of the whole (changes to law or by-laws) disbands the committee.

===Working committees===

An ad hoc committee established to accomplish a particular task or to oversee an ongoing area in need of control or oversight. Many are research or co-ordination committees in type or purpose, and can be temporary. Some are a sub-group of a larger society with a particular area of interest which decides to meet and discuss matters pertaining to their interests. For example a group of astronomers might get together ad hoc to discuss how to get the larger society to address near earth objects; A subgroup of engineers and scientists of a large project's development team could meet ad hoc to solve some particular issue with offsetting considerations and trade-offs. The term when used officially, generally means a group with specific duties and related authority, so when encountered in official contexts subsumes all other official types of committees. The International Commission on Stratigraphy and its subcommittees (commissions in name) are working committees that meet both far more regularly and more frequently both in deliberation and co-ordination furthering the needs of the IUGS (which regularly schedules meetings only every fourth year) and the larger scientific community.

==Need==

Committees are a necessary aspect of organizations of any significant size (say, more than 15 or 20 people).  They keep the number of participants manageable.

===Cross-field reasons===

Committees are a way to formally draw together people of relevant expertise from different parts of an organization who otherwise would not have a good way to share information and coordinate actions.  They may have the advantage of widening viewpoints and sharing out responsibilities. They can also be empaneled with experts to recommend actions by the committee of the whole in matters that require specialized knowledge or technical judgment. A "Defense" or "Banking" subcommittee in legislative bodies or the many International science commissions such as the ICS mentioned above, or a local "board of health" are or may be such.

==Conference committee==

A conference committee is a joint committee of a bicameral legislature, which is appointed by, and consists of, members of both chambers to resolve disagreements on a particular bill.
While such committees are common in the United States Congress and legislatures in other countries with Presidential Systems, they are no longer in use in the Parliament of the United Kingdom or most other bicameral Westminster system parliaments.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] A conference committee is usually composed of the senior members of the standing committees of each House that originally considered the legislation. In the United States Congress, a Conference Committee is a temporary panel of House and Senate negotiators, created to resolve differences between the versions of similar House and Senate bills.

==Standing committees==

A standing committee is a subunit of a political or deliberative body established in a permanent fashion to aid the parent assembly in accomplishing its duties.  A standing  committee is usually granted jurisdiction over a particular area of legislation by the parent body.
Under the laws of the United States of America, a standing committee is a Congressional committee permanently authorized by United States House of Representatives and United States Senate rules. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 greatly reduced the number of committees, and set up the legislative committee structure still in use today, as modified by authorized changes via the orderly mechanism of rules changes.

===Executive standing committee===

The section in the government were the make executive decisions
===Legislatures=== 
The phrase is used in the legislatures of the following countries:
====Parliamentary committees==== 
The following take part in the parliamentary procedure:

==Steering committees==

A steering committee is a committee that provides guidance, direction and control to a project within an organization.[tpl]cite book|author=Mcleod|title=Management Information Systems | edition = 10 | year = 2008|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-81-317-1949-7|page=201[/tpl] The term is derived from the steering mechanism that changes the steering angle of a vehicle's wheels.
Project Steering Committees are frequently used for guiding and monitoring the information technology projects in large organizations, as part of project governance. The functions of the committee might include building a business case for the project, planning, providing assistance and guidance, monitoring the progress, controlling the project scope and resolving conflicts.
