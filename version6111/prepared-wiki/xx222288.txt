[[Books of the Art]]

CATEGORIES: Works by Clive Barker

Books of the Art or The Art Trilogy is a planned trilogy of novels by Clive Barker, of which only the first two have been published. Book one is The Great and Secret Show, which tells the tale of two superhumans, Fletcher and The Jaffe, and their battles. The second book, Everville, goes deeper into the mythology of the cosm (essentially, Earth) and the metacosm (another plane of existence containing the dream sea Quiddity).
Barker has spoken of the third book frequently over the years, but he has not yet written it and there is no schedule for its release.Clive Barker Revelations
