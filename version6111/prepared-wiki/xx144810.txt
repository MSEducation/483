==Description==

Very closely allied to Cyaniris puspa, from which it differs as follows: Male Upperside: dull indigo-blue, not so dark as puspa when looked at from above vertically and with much less refulgent iridescence in an oblique light; the white on both fore and hind wings much more clearly defined,never diffuse and apparently prcsont at all seasons; on the fore wing the white is limited to the basal portions of interspaces 2 and 3 and does not extend into the cell or above vein 4; on the hind wing it occupies the basal half of interspace 6 and is strictly bounded by vein 7 above and vein 6 below. The terminal margins of both fore and hind wings with much narrower black edgings than in C. puspa. Underside: differs from that of puspa in the markings, which are smaller and much more delicate; on the fore wing the transverse postdiscal series of abbreviated line-like markings is bisinuate, placed further towards the terminal margin and has the component spots somewhat differently arranged; on the hind wing also the spots on the disc posteriorly are more regular than in puspa. 
Female: Upperside ground-colour and white on disc of wings almost as in puspa, but always both in fore and hind wings more limited, the black costal and terminal margins consequently broader. Underside: the markings as in the male, and therefore differ in a similar manner from those of C. puspa female. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen in both sexes as in C. puspa.Bingham, C. T.
