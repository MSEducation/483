The company started in 1994 as a hobby of Beckey Neal's.  In 1999, Neal and her daughter, Kim Godsey, opened a retail store in Tupelo, Mississippi.  The company has had to change its base of operations three times, from a [tpl]convert|1200|sqft|m2|sing=on[/tpl] operation, to a [tpl]convert|24000|sqft|m2[/tpl] facility, to a [tpl]convert|67000|sqft|m2[/tpl] former bicycle factory that itself was later increased in size to [tpl]convert|83000|sqft|m2[/tpl].  The factory is in Mooreville, Mississippi.  Less than two years after starting the retail store, both Neal and Godsey quit their medical careers.
A new Wicks n' More specialty candle, Elite Essentials, contains wax made of palm oil, a renewable and sustainable wax.  This is considered environmentally friendlier than the typical paraffin wax, as paraffin is petroleum-based.[tpl]cite web |url=http://1greenproduct.com/2008/07/home-wicks-n-more-elite-essentials.html |title=Wicks nâ€™ More Elite Essentials Candles |accessdate=2008-07-28 |author=Aaron Dalton |publisher=1greenproduct.com |date=2008-07-11 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In July 2008, media commentator Rush Limbaugh announced in frustration that he could not find large enough gardenia-scented candles to effectively scent his home.  In response, Wicks n' More sent Limbaugh a shipment of large gardenia-scented candles.  After Limbaugh mentioned the generosity of Wicks n' More, their internet traffic increased by a factor of ten, and its sales figures increased fivefold.
