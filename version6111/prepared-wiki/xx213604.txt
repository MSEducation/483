The Schütte-Lanz D.IV was a German fighter prototype during World War I. It was developed in parallel with the Schütte-Lanz D.III, however the two fighters had nothing in common. The D IV was made of wood and was a single-bay staggered biplane with N-type interplane struts and ailerons on both upper and lower mainplanes. It first flew in late 1917 and was found to be inferior to the Schütte-Lanz D.III, and as a result production was never continued.
