The original conception of the station was to act as a major junction in a planned "North Suburban Railway System."  The Argus reported in 1887 that "The Station at Union-street, as shown on our plan, must necessarily be the most important in the Northern System, as lines branch from this point to Preston and Whittlesea on the north ; Heidelberg, Kew, &.c., on the east; Carlton, Royal-park, North Melbourne, and Spencer-street on the south-west; Fitzroy, East Melbourne, and Flinders-street on the  
south; and if the alternative route is adopted, Clifton-hill, Collingwood, Richmond, and Flinders street on the south east." The Argus 9 December 1887
