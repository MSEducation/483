The South African Class 14B 4-8-2 of 1915 is a South African steam locomotive from the 
South African Railways era.
In 1915 the South African Railways placed fifteen Class 14B steam locomotives with a 4-8-2 Mountain wheel arrangement in service. When they were subsequently converted to superheating, they were reclassified to Class 14. Later all but one were reboilered with Watson Standard no 2 boilers and reclassified Class 14R.[tpl]Paxton-Bourne|pages=10-11, 58[/tpl][tpl]Durrant-Twilight|pages=63-64[/tpl]

==Manufacturer==

The third version of the Class 14 locomotive was ordered from Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1914. Because it was intended for use on the lower section of the Natal mainline where speeds were low with frequent stops, D.A. Hendrie, then the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR), concluded that no high degree of superheat would be attainable, so they were ordered without superheaters. These non-superheated versions of the Class 14 became the Class 14B. Like the Class 14, the Class 14B had Walschaerts valve gear and a Belpaire firebox. Fifteen locomotives were delivered from Beyer, Peacock in 1915, numbered in the range from 1746 to 1760.

==Modification and reclassification==

In service the omission of superheating soon became a bone of contention. About six years after the Class 14B was commissioned, it was claimed in a report that the loss of haulage power and increased water and coal consumption brought about by the absence of superheating on these locomotives represented a loss to the SAR of approximately £100,000. Given that eight years later, in 1929, the purchase price of a new Class 19A was £6,387 (£5,323 for the locomotive and £1,064 for the tender), this was a staggering amount.Sterkstroom, Municipality - SAR Class 19A No 692
Conversion of the Class 14B to superheating began soon afterwards and by 1927 all fifteen Class 14B locomotives were converted. Since their being non-superheated had been the sole reason for their separate Class 14B classification, they were all reclassified to Class 14.[tpl]Durrant-Twilight|pages=63-64[/tpl]
Of all the locomotives introduced during Hendrie’s term as CME, the Class 14B was the only one to fall short of expectations. In fairness to Hendrie and his decision to omit superheating, a report had been submitted in Natal earlier to the effect that superheating was of little or no value on that system, where the many short or steep gradients prevented a high degree of superheat from being attained with the automatic dampers in use at the time.

==Watson Standard boilers==

During the 1930s many serving locomotives were reboilered with a standard boiler type designed by then CME A.G. Watson as part of his standardisation policy. Such Watson Standard reboilered locomotives were reclassified by adding an "R" suffix to their classification.
All the ex Class 14B locomotives except number 1750 were eventually reboilered with Watson Standard no 2 boilers and reclassified once again, to Class 14R. In the process they were also equipped with Watson cabs, with their distinctive slanted fronts, compared to the conventional vertical fronts of their original cabs. Number 1750 was sold to ISCOR unreboilered.
An obvious visual difference between an original and a Watson Standard reboilered locomotive is usually a rectangular regulator cover just to the rear of the chimney on the reboilered locomotive. In the case of the Class 14B locomotives two even more obvious visual differences are the Watson cab and the absence of the Belpaire firebox hump between the cab and boiler on the reboilered locomotives.

==Service==

They were placed in service on the lower sections of the Natal mainline, particularly the Town Hill section near Pietermaritzburg.

Five were eventually sold into industrial service:
