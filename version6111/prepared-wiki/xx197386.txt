Shaquanzi ([tpl]zh|c=沙泉子|p=Shāquánzǐ[/tpl]) is a small town in Xinjiang, China about 100 km from the border with Kazakhstan.

==Transport==

The town is served by the original railway which connected China with Kazakhstan via Druzhba, Kazakhstan and Alashankou, China in the early 1990s. 
In 2008, a BOOT scheme proposes to build a more direct line to Almaty in Kazahkstan which would branch off the existing line in the vicinity of this town.
