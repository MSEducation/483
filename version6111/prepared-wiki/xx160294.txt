Wolverhampton [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Wolverhampton.ogg|ˌ|w|ʊ|l|v|ər|ˈ|h|æ|m|p|t|ən[/tpl] is a city and metropolitan borough in the West Midlands, England. In the 2011 census, the local government district had population of 249,470. Wolverhampton's urban population at the time of the 2001 census was given as 251,462, and was the second largest component of the West Midlands Urban AreaKS01 Usual resident population Census 2001, Key Statistics for urban areas Office for National Statistics. Hectares converted into km2 which makes it part of the second largest urban area in the United Kingdom. By this reckoning, it is the 12th largest city in England outside London. For Eurostat purposes, Wolverhampton is a NUTS 3 region (code UKG39).  People from Wolverhampton are known as "Wulfrunians".
Historically a part of Staffordshire, and forming part of the metropolitan county of the West Midlands from 1974, the city is commonly recognised as being named after Lady Wulfrun, who founded the town in 985: its name coming from Anglo-Saxon Wulfrūnehēantūn = "Wulfrūn's high or principal enclosure or farm".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/history/farley/oldwlv.htm |title=Wolverhampton 985 – 1985 |year=1985 |author=Keith Farley |publisher=Wolverhampton History & Heritage Society |accessdate=8 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The Place-names of Staffordshire |first=David |last=Horovitz |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |year=2005 |isbn=0955030900 |page=662 |page=585 |accessdate=12 November 2012 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=A History of Wolverhampton |first=Chris |last=Upton |authorlink= |publisher=The History Press |location= |year=2007 |isbn=186077508X |page=179 |page=8 |accessdate=12 November 2012 |url=[/tpl] Prior to the Norman Conquest, the area's name appears only as variants of Heantune or Hamtun, the prefix Wulfrun or similar appearing in 1070 and thereafter.

The city grew initially as a market town with specialism within the woollen trade. During and after the Industrial Revolution, the city became a major industrial centre, with mining (mostly coal, limestone and iron ore) as well as production of steel, japanning, locks, motorcycles and cars – including the first vehicle to hold the Land speed record at over 200 mph. Today, the major industries within the city are both engineering based (including a large aerospace industry) and within the service sector.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/culture/historic_weurope2.html#Anchor-United-60133 |title=Historic Cities in Western Europe |publisher=City Mayors |accessdate=17 June 2008[/tpl]

==History==

A local tradition states that King Wulfhere of Mercia founded an abbey of St Mary at Wolverhampton in 659.
Wolverhampton is recorded as being the site of a decisive battle between the unified Mercian Angles and West Saxons against the raiding Danes in 910, although sources are unclear as to whether the battle itself took place in Wednesfield or Tettenhall.[tpl]cite book |last= Horovitz |first= David |title= Notes and Materials on the Battle of Tettenhall 910 A.D., and Other Researches |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0-9550309-1-8[/tpl] The Mercians and West Saxons claimed a decisive victory and the field of Woden is recognised by numerous place names in Wednesfield.[tpl]cite web |title= Wolverhampton City Council – Wodensfield School |publisher = Wolverhampton City Council |url=http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/education_learning/schools/list/primary/Wodensfield.htm |accessdate=8 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title= Wodensfield Tower |publisher = Skyscraper Page |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21576 |accessdate=8 July 2007[/tpl]
In 985, King Ethelred the Unready granted lands at a place referred to as Heantun to Lady Wulfrun by royal charter,[tpl]cite web |title= Lady Wulfruna |publisher = Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/wulfruna/wulfruna01.htm |accessdate=13 June 2008[/tpl] and hence founding the settlement.
In 994, a monastery was consecrated in Wolverhampton for which Wulfrun granted land at Upper Arley in Worcestershire, Bilston, Willenhall, Wednesfield, Pelsall, Ogley Hay near Brownhills, Hilton near Wall, Hatherton, Kinvaston, Hilton near Wolverhampton, and Featherstone. This became the site for the current St. Peter's Church.[tpl]cite web |title= History of Wolverhampton |publisher = Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/history/farley/oldwlv.htm |accessdate=13 June 2008[/tpl] A statue of Lady Wulfrun, sculpted by Sir Charles Wheeler, can be seen on the stairs outside the church.
In 1179, there is mention of a market held in the town, and in 1204 it had come to the attention of King John that the town did not possess a Royal Charter for holding a market. This charter for a weekly market held on a Wednesday was eventually granted on 4 February 1258 by Henry III.
It is held that in the 14th and 15th centuries that Wolverhampton was one of the "staple towns" of the woollen trade, which today can be seen by the inclusion of a woolpack on the city's coat of arms,[tpl]cite web |title=Wolverhampton Coat of Arms – Wolverhampton History |url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/politics/local_government/wolves/coat_arms/index.html?sid=d988a0dcd52acacef8612d4e5f01f4e6 |publisher=Wolverhampton City Council |accessdate=11 June 2008[/tpl] and by the many small streets, especially in the city centre, called "Fold" (examples being Blossom's Fold, Farmers Fold, Townwell Fold and Victoria Fold), as well as Woolpack Street and Woolpack Alley.
In 1512, Sir Stephen Jenyns, a former Lord Mayor of London and a twice Master of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors, who was born in the city, founded Wolverhampton Grammar School, one of the oldest active schools in Britain.[tpl]cite web |title= Wolverhampton Grammar School |publisher = Wolverhampton Grammar School |url=http://www.wolverhamptongrammarschool.com/pages/prospective/history.aspx |accessdate=16 June 2008[/tpl]
From the 16th century onwards, Wolverhampton became home to a number of metal industries including lock and key making and iron and brass working.
Wolverhampton suffered two Great Fires: the first in April 1590, and the second in September 1696. Both fires started in today's Salop Street. The first fire lasted for five days and left nearly 700 people homeless, whilst the second destroyed 60 homes in the first five hours. This second fire led to the purchase of the first fire engine within the city in September 1703.
On 27 January 1606,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/history/chronology/upto1700.htm |title=Up to 1700, Wolverhampton History & Heritage Website |publisher=Localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] two farmers, Thomas Smart and John Holyhead of Rowley Regis, were executed on High Green, now Queen Square, for sheltering two of the Gunpowder Plotters, Robert Wintour and Stephen Littleton,[tpl]cite web|url=http://rowleyvillage.webs.com/rowleytimeline.htm |title=Time Line for Rowley |publisher=Rowleyvillage.webs.com |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] who had fled to the Midlands. The pair played no part in the original plot but nevertheless suffered a traitor's death of being hanged, drawn and quartered on butcher's blocks set up in the square a few days before the execution of Guy Fawkes and several other plotters in London. There is also evidence it may have been the location of the first working Newcomen Engine in 1712.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rana|first=Suhail|title=New evidence supporting Wolverhampton as the location of the first working Newcomen engine|journal=International Journal for the history of Engineering and Technology|year=2009|volume=72|issue=2|pages=162–173[/tpl]

===19th century===

In Victorian times, Wolverhampton grew to be a wealthy town mainly due to the huge amount of industry that occurred as a result of the abundance of coal and iron deposits in the area. The remains of this wealth can be seen in local houses such as Wightwick Manor and The Mount (both built for the Mander family, prominent varnish and paint manufacturers), and Tettenhall Towers. Many other houses of similar stature were built only to be demolished in the 1960s and 1970s.
Wolverhampton gained its first parliamentary representation as part of the Reform Act 1832, when it was one of 22 large towns that were allocated two members of parliament. It was incorporated as a municipal borough on 15 March 1848 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 before becoming a County Borough in 1889.[tpl]cite web |url=http://johnwoodfield.co.uk/oldwlv.htm |title=A History of Wolverhampton 985–1985|publisher=John Woodfield |accessdate=26 June 2008[/tpl]
The railways reached Wolverhampton in 1837, with the first station located at Wednesfield Heath, now Heath Town on the Grand Junction Railway.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.virgintrainsmediaroom.com/media/adobepdf/3%20Grand%20Junction%20D.pdf |format=PDF|title=The first trunk line – The Grand Junction Railway |publisher=Virgin Trains |accessdate=1 July 2008[/tpl] This station was demolished in 1965, but the area exists as a nature reserve just off Powell Street.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/railways/heath%20town.htm |title=Heath Town Station |publisher=Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |accessdate=1 July 2008[/tpl] Wolverhampton railway works was established in 1849 for the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway and became the Northern Division workshop of the Great Western Railway in 1854.[tpl]cite web |url=http://johnwoodfield.co.uk/wlvmanuf.htm |title=A History of Manufacturing in Wolverhampton |publisher=John Woodfield |accessdate=1 July 2008[/tpl]
In the 19th century the city saw much immigration from Wales and Ireland, following the Irish Potato Famine.
In 1866, a statue was erected in memory of Prince Albert the Prince Consort, the unveiling of which brought Queen Victoria to Wolverhampton.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wolverhamptonarchives.dial.pipex.com/local_queen.htm |title=Queen Victoria's Visit to Wolverhampton |publisher=Wolverhampton Archives & Local Studies |accessdate=17 June 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080214205957/http://www.wolverhamptonarchives.dial.pipex.com/local_queen.htm  |archivedate = 14 February 2008[/tpl] The unveiling of the statue was the first public appearance Queen Victoria had made since the funeral of her husband. A [tpl]convert|40|ft|m|0|adj=on[/tpl] tall archway made of coal was constructed for the visit. The Queen was so pleased with the statue that she knighted the then-mayor, an industrialist named John Morris.  Market Square, originally named High Green, was renamed Queen Square in honour of the visit. The statue replaced a Russian cannon captured from Sevastopol during the Crimean War in 1855, and remains standing in Queen Square.
Wolverhampton was represented politically in Victorian times by the Liberal MP Charles Pelham Villiers, a noted free trade supporter, who was also the longest serving MP in parliamentary history. Lord Wolverhampton, Henry Hartley Fowler was MP for Wolverhampton at the turn of the century.

===Since 1900===

Wolverhampton had a prolific bicycle industry from 1868 to 1975, during which time a total of more than 200 bicycle manufacturing companies existed there, but today none exist at all. These manufacturers included Marston, Sunbeam, Star, Wulfruna and Rudge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/work/industry/bicycle |title=History of Wolverhampton Bicycle Industry |publisher=Wolverhampton History |date=7 September 2005 |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] The last volume manufacturers of bicycles left Wolverhampton during the 1970s, the remnants which shut down during the 1980s being small companies including Percy Stallard (the former professional cyclist) and Jack Hateley.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/work/industry/bicycle2 |title=The Bicycle Industry |publisher=Wolverhampton History |date=8 September 2005 |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl]
Wolverhampton High Level station (the current main railway station) opened in 1852, but the original station was demolished in 1965 and then rebuilt.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.railaroundbirmingham.co.uk/Stations/wolverhampton.php |title=Wolverhampton Station |publisher=Rail around Birmingham and the West Midlands |accessdate=1 July 2008[/tpl] Wolverhampton Low Level station opened on the Great Western Railway in 1855.

Mass council housing development in Wolverhampton, to rehouse families from slum housing, began after the end of the Great War, with new estates at Parkfields (near the border with Coseley) and Birches Barn (near Bantock Park in the west of Wolverhampton) being built, giving the city some 550 new council houses by 1923. The first large council housing development in Wolverhampton was the Low Hill estate to the north-east of the city, which consisted of more than 2,000 new council houses by 1927 and was one of the largest housing estates in Britain at the time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geograph.org.uk/article/A-History-of-Council-Housing-in-Wolverhampton/2 |title=A History of Council Housing in Wolverhampton :: Geograph Britain and Ireland – photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] Mass council housing development in Wolverhampton continued into the 1930s, mostly in the north of the city in the Oxley and Wobaston areas and on the new Scotlands Estate in the north-east. However, council house building halted in 1940 following the outbreak of World War II in September the previous year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geograph.org.uk/article/A-History-of-Council-Housing-in-Wolverhampton/3 |title=A History of Council Housing in Wolverhampton :: Geograph Britain and Ireland – photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl]
Wolverhampton St George's (in the city centre) is now the northern terminus for the Midland Metro light rail system. Wolverhampton was one of the few towns to operate surface contact trams and the only town to use the Lorain Surface Contact System.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/Trams/Trams.htm |title=Trams in Wolverhampton |publisher=Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |accessdate=1 July 2008[/tpl] Trolleybuses appeared in 1923 and in 1930 for a brief period, the Wolverhampton trolleybus system was the world's largest trolleybus system.[tpl]cite book |author=Graham Sidwell |title=Wolverhampton Trolleybuses 1961–67 |year=2006 |publisher=Middleton Press |isbn=978-1-904474-85-2 [/tpl] The last Wolverhampton trolleybus ran in 1967, just as the railway line through the High Level station was converted to electric operation.

Sir Geoffrey Le Mesurier Mander, a member of the Mander family, was Liberal MP for Wolverhampton East from 1929 to 1945, distinguished for his stance against Appeasement and as a supporter of the League of Nations; known as "the last of the Midland radicals". More recent members have included the Conservative mavericks Enoch Powell and Nicholas Budgen. Powell was a member of Edward Heath's Tory shadow cabinet from 1964, until he was dismissed in April 1968 following his controversial Rivers of Blood speech in which he warned of massive civil unrest if mass immigration of black and Asian commonwealth inhabitants continued.  In 2005, former Bilston councillor and MP for Wolverhampton South East, Dennis Turner entered the House of Lords as Lord Bilston.
After the end of World War II in 1945, the council erected 400 prefabricated bungalows across Wolverhampton, and built its first permanent postwar houses at the Underhill Estate near Bushbury in the late 1940s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geograph.org.uk/article/A-History-of-Council-Housing-in-Wolverhampton/4 |title=A History of Council Housing in Wolverhampton :: Geograph Britain and Ireland – photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] The 1950s saw many new houses and flats built across Wolverhampton as the rehousing programme from the slums continued, as well as the local council agreeing deals with neighbouring authorities Wednesfield Urban District and Seisdon Rural District which saw families relocated to new estates in those areas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geograph.org.uk/article/A-History-of-Council-Housing-in-Wolverhampton/5 |title=A History of Council Housing in Wolverhampton :: Geograph Britain and Ireland – photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] The 1960s saw the rehousing programme continue, with multi-storey blocks being built on a large scale across Wolverhampton at locations including Blakenhall, Whitmore Reans and Chetton Green.

Large numbers of black and Asian immigrants had settled in Wolverhampton in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Wolverhampton is home to a large proportion of the Sikh community, who settled there during the period (1935–1975) from the Indian state of Punjab. Today, the Sikh community in Wolverhampton is roughly 7% of the city's population.
In 1974, as a result of local government reorganisation, Wolverhampton became a metropolitan borough.  The United Kingdom government announced on 18 December 2000 that Wolverhampton would be granted city status, making it one of three "Millennium Cities",[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1074434.stm |title=City winners named |publisher=BBC News |date=18 December 2000 |accessdate=8 July 2007[/tpl] an honour that had been unsuccessfully applied for in 1953, 1966, 1977,[tpl]cite book |author=J.V.

Wolverhampton also made an unsuccessful application for a Lord Mayor in 2002.
Many of the city centre's buildings date from the early 20th century and before, the oldest buildings being St Peter's Church (which was built in the 13th century but has been largely extended and refurbished since the 15th century, situated on Lichfield Street)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/listed/stpeterschurch.htm |title=St Peter's Church |publisher=Localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] and a framed timber 17th-century building on Victoria Street which is now one of just two remaining in the area which was heavily populated by them until the turn of the 20th century. This building was originally a residential property, but later became the Hand Inn public house. It was completely restored in 1981 after a two-year refurbishment project and has been used by various businesses since then – currently as a second hand book shop.[tpl]cite web|last=Wulfrun |first=Lady |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/8050359@N07/2502450004/ |title=Lindy Lou, AKA The Copper Kettle, 19 Victoria Street, Wolverhampton, 1979.|publisher=Flickr |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl]
In 1960, plans were announced to build a Ring Road around the centre of Wolverhampton. By the end of the 1960s, more than half of the Ring Road had been completed, stretching from Snow Hill to Stafford Street (via Penn Road, Chapel Ash and Waterloo Road), followed a few years later by a section between Snow Hill and Bilston Street. However, the final section between Bilston Street and Stafford Street (via Wednesfield Road) was not completed until 1986.
The centre of Wolverhampton has been altered radically since the mid-1960s; with the Mander Centre (plans for which were unveiled on 15 April 1965)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/days/1950-75/1966.html |title=Those were the days |work=Express & Star |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] being opened in two phases, the first in 1968 and the second in 1971. Several refurbishments have taken place since.  The Wulfrun Centre, an open shopping area, was opened alongside the Mander Centre's first phase in 1968, but has been undercover since a roof was added in the late 1990s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/wolverhampton.html |title=A History of Wolverhampton |publisher=Localhistories.org |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl]
Central Wolverhampton police station was built just south of the city centre on Birmingham Road during the 1960s, but operations there were cut back in the early 1990s when a new larger police station was built on Bilston Street on land which became vacant a decade earlier on the demolition of a factory. This was officially opened by Diana, Princess of Wales, on 31 July 1992.[tpl]cite web|last=Wulfrun |first=Lady |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/8050359@N07/1020232961/ |title=Market Street, Wolverhampton June 1981. |publisher=Flickr |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl]
The city centre had several cinemas during the 20th century, the last of these was the ABC Cinema (formerly the Savoy) on the corner of Garrick Street and Bilston Street, which closed on 17 October 1991 after 54 years. It has since been converted into a nightclub, with part of the site being converted into the offices of a recruitment agency in 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/Cinemas/Cinemas.htm |title=A Century of Cinema in Wolverhampton |publisher=Localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl]
A modern landmark in the city centre is the Crown Court on Bilston Street, which opened in 1990 as the town's first purpose built crown court.[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Many department store chains including Beatties, Marks and Spencer, British Homes Stores and Next have stores in the centre of Wolverhampton. Rackhams had a store on Snow Hill for some 25 years until 1992. This building was then divided between a Netto supermarket and the local archives service but by 2006 its future was under threat as part of the proposed Summer Row retail development. This led to the closure of the Netto supermarket in June 2007 and the closure of the archives service in October 2008. However, the Summer Row project has since fallen through and the building remains dormant.
The city's name is often abbreviated to "Wolvo" or "W'ton".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blackcountry/content/image_galleries/wton_st_georges_06_gallery.shtml |title=In Pics: W'ton St George's Day |publisher=BBC Black Country |accessdate=8 July 2007[/tpl] or "Wolves".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wolvescivic.co.uk/index.asp?loc=home |title=Wolverhampton Civic Hall |accessdate=8 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blackcountry/content/articles/2005/09/04/wolverhampton_marathon_2005_feature.shtml |title=Wolverhampton Marathon 2005 |publisher=BBC Black Country |date=17 October 2005 |accessdate=8 July 2007[/tpl]

===Art and culture===

From the 18th century, Wolverhampton was well known for production of the japanned ware and steel jewellery. The renowned 18th- and 19th-century artists Joseph Barney (1753–1832), Edward Bird (1772–1819), George Wallis (1811–1891) were all born in Wolverhampton and initially trained as japanned ware painters.
The School of Practical Art was opened in the 1850s and eventually became a close associate of the Art Gallery. Among its students and teachers were Robert Jackson Emerson (1878–1944), Sir Charles Wheeler (Emerson's most famous pupil and the sculptor of the fountains in Trafalgar Square), Sara Page who established her studio in Paris, and many other artists and sculptors recognised locally and nationally.
Wolverhampton Art Gallery was established in 1884, whilst Wolverhampton Grand Theatre was opened in 1894.
There is a Creative Industries Quarter in Wolverhampton, just off Broad Street. From the newly opened Slade Rooms, to the art house cinema the Light House Media Centre and the Arena Theatre which is part of the University of Wolverhampton.

===Exhibitions===

As its wealth and influence grew, Wolverhampton both took part in notable exhibitions and hosted them. The Great Exhibition of 1851, at The Crystal Palace, had examples of locks, japanned ware, enamel ware and papier-mâché products all manufactured in Wolverhampton.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/grtexhib/gtexhib.htm|title=Wolverhampton at the Great Exhibition, 1851|author=Frank Sharman|publisher=Wolverhampton History & Heritage Website|accessdate=15 October 2012[/tpl]
Following successful exhibitions at Mechanics' Institutes in Manchester and many northern towns, Wolverhampton held an exhibition that was the brain child of George Wallis, an artist employed by the firm of Ryton and Walton. The exhibition was held in the Mechanics' Institute in Queen Street and showed both fine art and furniture, decorated trays, as well as a variety of ironwork, locks and steel toys.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/electronic/exhibs/wolverhampton_exhibitions.htm|title=Exhibitions Great and Small|author=Frank Sharman|publisher=Wolverhampton History & Heritage Website|accessdate=15 October 2012[/tpl]
On 11 May 1869 The Earl Granville opened the Exhibition of Staffordshire Arts and Industry in a temporary building in the grounds of Molineux House.
The largest and most ambitious exhibition was the Arts and Industrial Exhibition which took place in 1902. Although housing only one international pavilion, from Canada, the scope and scale of the exhibition mirrored all the advances in other exhibitions of its time. The exhibition site featured several halls housing machinery, industrial products, a concert hall, two bandstands, a restaurant, and a fun fair with thrill rides and a water chute. Its opening, by the Duke of Connaught, was received with hopeful enthusiasm, unfortunately not matched by the weather, which contributed to a £30,000 loss, equivalent to nearly £2M at today's value.

==Geography==

Wolverhampton lies northwest of its larger near-neighbour Birmingham, and forms the second largest part of the West Midlands conurbation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/census2001/ks_urban_midlands_part_1.pdf |format=PDF|title= Key Statistics for Urban Areas in the Midlands |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2 July 2008[/tpl] To the north and west lies the Staffordshire and Shropshire countryside.

Wolverhampton city centre falls outside of the area traditionally known as the Black Country, although some districts such as Bilston and Heath Town and the Willenhall side of Wolverhampton fall within the Black Country coalfields, leading to confusion as to whether the entire city falls within the region. Modern usage has tended towards using the term to refer to the western part of the West Midlands county, excluding Birmingham, Solihull and Coventry. Examples would be UK Government regional bodies such as the Black Country Development Corporation, under whose remit the city fell.
The city lies upon the Midlands Plateau at approximately [tpl]convert|120|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070423/debtext/70423-0011.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 23 Apr 2007 |publisher=United Kingdom Parliament |accessdate=17 June 2008[/tpl] There are no major rivers within the city, although the River Penk and River Tame (tributaries of the River Trent) rise in the city, as does Smestow Brook, a tributary of the River Stour, and thence the River Severn. This means that the city lies astride the main east-west watershed of England.
The geology of the city is complex, with a combination of Triassic and Carboniferous geology; specifically Bunter and Keuper sandstone, and Upper and Middle Coal measures. There is also an area of dolerite intrusions.[tpl]cite book |author=The West Midland Group |title=Conurbation: A Survey of Birmingham and the Black Country |page=41 |year=1948 |publisher=The Architectural Press |location=London[/tpl]

===Climate===

Wolverhampton's climate is oceanic (Köppen Cfb) and therefore quite temperate with average maximum temperatures in July being around [tpl]convert|21|°C|°F|0[/tpl] with the maximum daytime temperature in January being around [tpl]convert|6.5|°C|°F[/tpl].
The Met Office's nearest observation station is at Penkridge, about [tpl]convert|5|mi|km|0[/tpl] north of the city.

===Areas of the city===

As with much of the locality, the majority of areas in Wolverhampton have names that are of Old English (Anglo-Saxon) origin, with a few exceptions such as Penn (pre-English Brittonic place name) and Parkfields, Park Village, Lanesfield etc. (modern place names of the last couple of hundred years).David Horovitz – The Place Names of Staffordshire (2006)

==Government==

The vast majority of Wolverhampton is governed locally by Wolverhampton City Council, although some smaller parts of the urban area are governed by South Staffordshire District Council.
The area administered by the City Council is represented in the national United Kingdom parliament by three MPs representing Wolverhampton South West, Wolverhampton South East and Wolverhampton North East constituencies, with the areas administered by South Staffordshire District Council being represented by South Staffordshire constituency. The entire city is part of the West Midlands constituency of the European Parliament.
Wolverhampton City Council is a unitary authority, meaning that it is an all-purpose local council. South Staffordshire District Council is a two-tier authority, with some services provided by Staffordshire County Council.

===Civic history===

Wolverhampton gained the beginnings of modern local government in 1777, when the Wolverhampton Improvement Act was passed by Parliament. This allowed for the establishment of 125 Town Commissioners who undertook a variety of local improvement work such as punishing bear baiting, improving drainage, widening streets and by the end of the century street lighting had been provided at every street corner and over the doorway of every inn, and water supply had been improved by the sinking of ten new wells and the provision of a great water tank in the market place. Policing had been improved with the appointment of ten watchmen and attempts were also made to regulate the markets and inspect hazardous food.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/politics/local_government/wolves/index.html?sid=14003c39a8d30c9d4326cdaba02d54e8 |title=Local Government in Wolverhampton |work=The History of Wolverhampton – The City and its People |year=2005 |accessdate=15 July 2007[/tpl]
Wolverhampton parliamentary borough was created by the Reform Act 1832, which included areas currently located with the Metropolitan Boroughs of Dudley, Walsall and Sandwell such as Wren's Nest, New Invention and Sedgley. It was one of 22 large towns that returned two members of parliament.  Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the original borough was replaced by three new single-member constituencies: Wolverhampton East, Wolverhampton South and Wolverhampton West.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/politics/parliamentary_representation |title=Parliamentary Representation |publisher=Wolverhampton Archives and Local Studies |accessdate=29 January 2013[/tpl]
In 1837, Wolverhampton Borough Police was formed. It was disestablished in 1966, and the larger West Midlands Constabulary, which covered not only Wolverhampton but the County Boroughs of Walsall, Dudley, West Bromwich and Warley took over its duties and was headquartered in the city. This force was then replaced in 1974 with the West Midlands Police.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.westmidlandspolicemuseum.co.uk/wolverhamptonboroughpolice.htm |title=Wolverhampton Borough Police |publisher=West Midlands Police Museum |accessdate=23 July 2008[/tpl]
Wolverhampton was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1849 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.staffordshire.gov.uk/leisure/archives/history/placeguide/SPGWolverhamptonTown.htm |title=Archive Gazetter – Wolverhampton |publisher=Staffordshire County Archives |accessdate=23 July 2008[/tpl] The town was then made a County Borough in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888.
In 1933, the boundaries of the borough expanded, taking in areas from Cannock Rural District and Seisdon Rural District, with very little of the surrounding urban area being affected,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10136544&c_id=10001043 |title=Relationships / unit history of WOLVERHAMPTON |publisher=A Vision of Britain |accessdate=15 July 2007[/tpl] with only Heath Town Urban District being abolished.
The bulk of the urban districts of Bilston (a borough itself after 1933), Tettenhall and Wednesfield were added to the borough in 1966, along with the northern section of the urban district of Coseley and parts from the north of Sedgley and the west of Willenhall.  The vast majority of these areas were traditionally part of the Parish of Wolverhampton, and were part of the original Parliamentary Borough.
Wolverhampton was one of only two County Boroughs (the other being Liverpool) to have no changes made to the boundary during the 1974 reorganisation of local government, the borough already having a population larger than the 250,000 required for education authorities. This contrasted with both the Redcliffe-Maud Report, and the initial White Paper for the 1974 reformsHMSO. Local Government in England: Government Proposals for Reorganisation. Cmnd. 4584 where large areas of the present South Staffordshire district were to be added to the borough. During the 1974 reforms it was placed within the West Midlands Metropolitan County.
Wolverhampton was also a Royal Peculiar covering a large area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stpetersguild.org.uk/thechurch.htm |title=The Church |publisher=St. Peter's Guild of Change Ringers|accessdate=23 July 2008[/tpl]

Many of the traditional industries in the city have closed or dramatically downsized. Famous companies once based in the city include:
Goodyear opened a large factory on Stafford Road, Fordhouses, in 1927. However, it was decided in December 2003 that tyre production at the plant would be discontinued with the loss of more than 400 jobs. This came after some 2,000 job losses at the plant since 1997. The end of production came in 2004 but the factory remains open for tyre moulding and tractor tyre production.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/3339551.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Job losses at Goodyear | date=22 December 2003[/tpl]

===Regeneration===

In recent years, Wolverhampton City Council has embarked on several city improvement and regeneration schemes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/business/regeneration/city_centre/ |title=City centre improvememnts |publisher=Wolverhampton City Council|date=13 July 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] One such project was Summer Row, a new £300 million retail quarter for Wolverhampton city centre.

==Transport==

===Road===

Wolverhampton city centre forms the main focal point for the road network within the northwestern part of the West Midlands conurbation, and out into the rural hinterland of Staffordshire and Shropshire.  The road network within the boundaries of the city council area is entirely maintained by Wolverhampton City Council, whilst those parts of the urban area outside the city council area have their networks maintained by Staffordshire County Council, with the exception of M54 and A449 on the northern fringes of the urban area which are maintained by the Highways Agency.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/our-road-network/our-network/network-map/ |title=Our Road Network |publisher=Highways Agency |accessdate=27 March 2013[/tpl]
Major historical improvements to the city's road network include Thomas Telford's Holyhead Road (now part of A41), which was constructed between 1819 and 1826 to improve communications between London and Holyhead, and hence to Ireland.  The majority of work within the city saw improvement to the contemporary network, though the both Wellington Road in Bilston[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/environment/land_premises/conservation/areas/Bilston+Town+Centre+Conservation+Area.htm |title=Bilston Town Centre Conservation Area |publisher=Wolverhampton City Council |accessdate=27 March 2013[/tpl] and the cutting at the Rock near Tettenhall were newly constructed for the road, although the improvements at The Rock were constructed by the local Turnpike Trust rather than Telford himself.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/listed/localist/TheRock.htm |title=The Rock, Tettenhall |publisher=Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |accessdate=27 March 2013[/tpl] In 1927, the A4123 Birmingham-Wolverhampton New Road was constructed as both an unemployment relief project, and to relieve pressure on Telford's road through the Black Country.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sedgleymanor.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=topn&cat=0&pos=8 |title=Birmingham New Road circa 1927 |publisher=Sedgleymanor Photo Gallery |accessdate=17 June 2008[/tpl] It was the first purpose built inter-city road in the United Kingdom within the 20th century,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lmars.co.uk/roadpix/a580/index.html |title=A580 East Lancashire Road |publisher=Lancashire Roads and Motorways Site |accessdate=24 July 2008[/tpl] and was said to be the longest stretch of new road in Britain since the Romans. It took just three years to complete and cost £600,000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/Media/75.pdf?MEDIA_ID=223058&FILENAME=75.pdf | format=PDF |title=Forward | publisher=Birmingham City Council |accessdate=24 July 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080609124804/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/Media/75.pdf?MEDIA_ID=223058&FILENAME=75.pdf  |archivedate = 9 June 2008[/tpl] Also in 1927, the first automatic traffic lights in the United Kingdom were installed in Princes Square in the city centre. Princes Square was also the location of the United Kingdom's first pedestrian safety barriers, which were erected in 1934.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/Museum/Engineering/Steelway/History.htm |title=Steelway Limited |publisher=Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |accessdate=24 December 2012[/tpl]
The city also has an Inner Ring Road, which circumnavigates the city centre linking the majority of the city's radial routes.  It was constructed in sections between 1960 and 1986, and carries the number A4150.
Wolverhampton is near to several motorways, with four being located within [tpl]convert|7|mi|km|0[/tpl] of the city centre.  The first to be constructed in the area was the M6, which opened in sections between 1966 and 1970,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/openings.htm |title=Opening dates for Motorways in the UK in chronological order |publisher=The Motorway Archive |accessdate=17 June 2008[/tpl] and connects the city with the north-west of England (including Manchester and Liverpool), Scotland as well as Birmingham and Coventry to the east, and London via the M1.  Together with the M5, which opened in the area in 1970 and links the city with the south-west of England, and London via the M40, the two motorways form a north-south bypass for the city.
The section of M6 motorway nearest to the city is one of the busiest within the UK,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.racfoundation.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=457&Itemid=35 |title=UK'S Congestion Hotspots Revealed |publisher=RAC Foundation |accessdate=15 December 2008[/tpl] and to relieve congestion on this stretch, the M6 Toll which bypasses both the Wolverhampton and Birmingham sections of the M6 motorway was opened in 2003.
The M54 motorway forms a northern bypass to the city, passing just within the fringes of the urban area, and links the city with Telford, Shrewsbury and Wales.  It opened in 1983.
In addition to the motorways presently constructed, there have also been several proposed near to the city that have not been constructed, or have been constructed to a lower standard.  Included within these are the Bilston Link Motorway, which was first proposed in the 1960s and was eventually constructed to a lower standard in the 1980s as the A454/A463 Black Country Route;[tpl]cite web |url=http://pathetic.org.uk/unbuilt/bilston_link_motorway/ |publisher=Pathetic Motorways |title=Bilston Link Motorway |accessdate=17 June 2008[/tpl] and the Western Orbital or Wolverhampton Western Bypass, which was first proposed in the 1970s as a bypass for the western side of the city and the wider Black Country conurbation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://pathetic.org.uk/unbuilt/western_orbital/ |title=Western Orbital |publisher=Pathetic Motorways |accessdate=17 June 2008[/tpl] Currently proposed by the Highways Agency is the M54 to M6 / M6 (Toll) Link Road. The route was initially proposed in the 2000s to relieve the overloaded sections of A460 and A449 near the city, and to replace a section of the cancelled Western Orbital.  Whilst it appears in the current roads programme, a date for the start of construction has not been set.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/11814.aspx |title=M54 to M6 / M6 (Toll) Link Road |publisher=Highways Agency |accessdate=17 June 2008[/tpl]

===Rail===

Wolverhampton's first railway opened in 1837, with the opening of the Grand Junction Railway, the first long-distance line in Great Britain.  The main station for the city was, however, not located in the city centre, but at Wednesfield Heath, now Heath Town on the east side of the city. This station was considered to be a First Class station, though its location was obviously not ideal and it became a goods station after passenger services ceased in 1873.  The station buildings were demolished in 1965, but the main station area is now a nature reserve just off Powell Street, called Station Fields and part of the edge of the northbound platform is still in situ. The track running through the station is, however, still in live use.
The first station in the city centre was opened by the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway in 1849.  This station was only designed to be a temporary station, and was located on the north side of Wednesfield Road beside Broad Street Basin.  The station was constructed as the opening of Wolverhampton High Level was delayed.  The station closed in 1852, and was demolished in the mid-1970s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/articles/railways/tmpsta.htmn.htm |title=Temporary Station |publisher=Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl] In addition to the temporary station, Wolverhampton railway works were also established in 1849 by the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway and became the Northern Division workshop of the Great Western Railway in 1854.
The permanent station on the line finally opened on 24 June 1852, and was initially known as Wolverhampton General, before being renamed as Wolverhampton Queen Street in 1853, and finally Wolverhampton High Level in 1855.  The station was initially a joint station between the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway and the London and North Western Railway, though there were problems in the relationships between the two companies, and the station became solely LNWR in 1854 before the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway (later part of the Midland Railway) gained access to the station in 1867.  The original High Level station was demolished in 1965 as part of the electification of the West Coast Mainline, and was replaced by the current buildings on the site.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/articles/railways/high%20level.htm |title=High Level Station |publisher=Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl]
Two years after the opening of the High Level station, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway opened their city centre station immediately to the east of High Level.  Initially called Wolverhampton Joint, it was renamed Wolverhampton Low Level in 1856. As well as the OWW, the station also served the Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Dudley Railway and the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway.  As the first two companies were supported by the Great Western Railway, broad gauge track was laid to the station, meaning that Wolverhampton Low Level became the most northerly station on the broad gauge network before being converted to standard gauge in 1869.  Despite being featured in the second Beeching Report, The Development of the Major Railway Trunk Routes in February 1965 as being on a line the should be further invested in, services were withdrawn from Low Level starting in 1967 soon after being moved from the Western Region of British Railways to the London Midland region, whose services used the High Level station.  Low Level was converted to act as a Parcels Concentration Depot in 1970, and the final passenger services were removed in 1972.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/articles/railways/Low%20Level.htm |title=Low Level Station |publisher=Wolverhampton History and Heritage Society |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl] Passenger services to Birmingham Snow Hill were only suspended and never legally withdrawn by British Rail, and so the station is technically still open.[tpl]cite journal | title = Regional News: Wolverhampton | journal = Rail | date = 21 March – 3 April 2012 | first = Howard | last = Johnston | issue = 692 | page = 24| id = | accessdate = 24 March 2012[/tpl]
There were also a number of suburban stations in Wolverhampton – including Dunstall Park and Bushbury north of the city centre; Tettenhall and Compton to the west side of the city on the GWR's Wombourne Branch Line; Wednesfield and Heath Town on the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway; Portobello on the Walsall to Wolverhampton Line; Priestfield and Bilston Central on the Birmingham Snow Hill to Wolverhampton Low Level Line; and Bilston West and Daisy Bank on the Oxford-Worcester-Wolverhampton Line.  Today, all of the suburban rail stations within the city have been closed, although Coseley, Codsall and Bilbrook are just outside the boundaries.
The former High Level station, now simply known as Wolverhampton station is today one of the major stations on the West Coast Main Line. It has regular rail services to London Euston, Birmingham New Street and Manchester Piccadilly, as well as most other major cities in the UK.  In addition to the long-distance services, there are many local services, including those on the Cambrian Line into Wales, the Walsall to Wolverhampton Line to Walsall, the Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury Line to Telford and Shrewsbury; and the Rugby-Birmingham-Stafford Line to Stafford and Coventry.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/ldbboard/dep/WVH |title=Live Departures – Wolverhampton |publisher=National Rail Enquiries |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/WVH/details.html |title=Wolverhampton (WVH) |publisher=National Rail Enquiries |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl]
The 1960s buildings of the station are proposed for redevelopment, with the main station buildings being demolished in a project called Wolverhampton Interchange.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.wolverhamptoninterchange.co.uk/ |title=Wolverhampton Interchange |publisher=Neptune Developments |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl] It was due to open in 2012,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.expressandstar.com/2006/10/18/all-change-at-station/ |title=All change at station |work=Express & Star |author=Becky Sharpe |date=18 October 2006 |accessdate=17 June 2008[/tpl] but work has been delayed whilst funding is sought.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/04/21/government-rejects-wolverhampton-station-funding-plea/ |title=Government Rejects Wolverhampton Station Funding Plea |work=Express & Star |author=Becky Sharpe |date=21 April 2011 |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl]

===Buses===

Buses in the city are run commercially by a number of bus operators, the largest provider of services is National Express West Midlands. As well as serving suburbs of the city, buses from the centre of Wolverhampton also provide a direct link with the city of Birmingham and connections to Walsall, Telford, West Bromwich, Stourbridge, Cannock, Sedgley, Bilston, Bloxwich, Bridgnorth & Dudley.
The city's bus station operated by Centro is situated at Piper's Row, near to the railway station, providing an interchange between the two modes of transport. 
The station has recently had a complete rebuild. Its previous Piper's Row incarnation opened on 26 October 1986, just six years after its predecessor of 1981.[tpl]cite web|last=Wulfrun |first=Lady |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/8050359@N07/2497493714/ |title=Wolverhampton's second, but short-lived Bus Station (off Railway Drive), 1981. | Flickr – Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] The station underwent a further upgrade in 1990 which saw the grade two listing Queen's Building incorporated into the bus station. A mild refurbishment took place in 2005/06 with new toilets and the addition of a coach stand. In July 2009 plans were unveiled for a complete rebuild of the bus station to form part of a new bus and rail interchange. The development will also see the railway station rebuilt and new flats and shops built nearby. The bus station closed in April 2010 and was demolished almost immediately, with the new £22.5 million station that opened on Sunday 24 July 2011.[tpl]cite web|author=Lou's Women |url=http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/06/21/glowing-future-for-wolverhampton-bus-station/ |title=Glowing future for Wolverhampton bus station |work=Express & Star|date=21 June 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl]
Along with the rebuild, buses for Wolverhampton and the west of Walsall were renumbered, with several re-routed, though this has not proved popular with some residents.[tpl]cite web|author=Lou's Women |url=http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/07/26/new-bus-network-could-be-reviewed/ |title=New bus network could be reviewed |work=Express & Star |date=26 July 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl]

===Metro===

The Midland Metro, a light rail system, currently connects Wolverhampton St. George's to Birmingham Snow Hill station via West Bromwich and Wednesbury, mostly following the former Birmingham Snow Hill-Wolverhampton Low Level Line. There are plans for further lines within the city, with both a city centre loop and a line to Walsall via Wednesfield and Willenhall, mostly following the route of the closed Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.centro.org.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.asp?lID=1826&sID=4319 |title=The 5Ws Route |publisher=Centro |format=PDF |accessdate=17 June 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Air===

Wolverhampton's original airport was at Pendeford, opened in 1938 and closed on 31 December 1970.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/Pendeford/Airport.htm |title=The Airport and Boulton Paul |work=The History of Pendeford |publisher=Wolverhampton History & Heritage Society |author=Phil Clayton |date=February 2004 |accessdate=17 June 2008[/tpl] The current Wolverhampton Airport, renamed from Halfpenny Green, is a small general aviation airfield located [tpl]convert|8|mi|km|1[/tpl] southwest of the city. Expansion of the airport has been suggested, but this has been successfully resisted by local residents.
The nearest major airport is Birmingham International Airport, approximately [tpl]convert|25|mi|km|1[/tpl] away. The airport is easy to reach by train, with a direct express service to it. By car, it can actually sometimes be quicker to reach Manchester Airport instead, due to traffic delays on the M6 eastbound motorway towards Birmingham International.

===Waterways===

There are no navigable rivers within the city, but there are 17 miles of navigable canals. The Birmingham Main Line Canal passes through the city centre, connecting with the remaining portion of the Wednesbury Oak Loop at Deepfields Junction, and the Wyrley & Essington Canal at Horseley Fields Junction, before passing between the railway station and the bus station in the city centre and then descending 132 feet (40m) through the 21 Wolverhampton Locks and terminating at Aldersley Junction where it meets the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, which in turn connects with the Shropshire Union Canal at Autherley Junction.Nicholson Waterways Guide, Volume 2 (2006), Harper Collins Publishing Ltd, ISBN 0-00-721110-4

===Cycling===

Most places in the borough and some of the neighbouring villages in South Staffordshire are within easy reach by pedal cycle of the city centre and terrain is moderately hilly. Climbs tend to be of two to three minutes duration. Cycling benefits from the [tpl]convert|20|mph|km/h|0[/tpl] city centre within the Ring Road and a number of routes that use quieter roads and paths to avoid the ten 'A' roads that radiate from the Ring Road. Wolverhampton is on the Smethwick to Telford section of Sustrans National Cycle Network Route 81.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sustrans.org.uk/default.asp?sID=1099911816156 |title=strans Route 81 |publisher=Sustrans |accessdate=24 July 2008[/tpl] This follows the Birmingham Main Line Canal towpath from Smethwick to Broad Street Basin, Wolverhampton where the route splits in two. The choice here is between riding the 21 locks section of the Birmingham Main Line Canal to Aldersley Junction or taking the Cross-City route braid to visit the city centre, West Park or Smestow Valley Leisure Ride before returning to Aldersley Junction. NCN81 continues to Autherley Junction along the towpath of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and then along the east bank towpath of the Shropshire Union Canal as far as Pendeford Mill Lane before turning to Bilbrook in Staffordshire. The lanes of nearby South Staffordshire and east Shropshire provide ideal cycle touring conditions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sustrans.org.uk/default.asp?sRegion=The_Midlands&map.x=-2.12099658260843&map.y=52.5904259392369&bLarge=&nZoom=3 |title=Cycle routes in Wolverhampton |publisher=Sustrans |accessdate=24 July 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

There are also a number of smaller venues with capacities between 100 and 250, the Wolverhampton Varsity being the most long-standing of these. The Little Civic closed and has been replaced by a much less loved 'Numa Bar'. The 18th-century St John's Church is a popular venue for smaller scale classical concerts. The city is also home to Regent Records, a choral and organ music recording company. The Midland Box Office is the primary sales point for most of Wolverhampton's venues and is situated in Queen Square, it is made up of a small team of dedicated and enthusiastic staff.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.regent-records.co.uk/contact_us.htm |title=Regent Records: Contact Us |accessdate=23 September 2008[/tpl]

===Libraries===

Located on the corner of Garrick Street and St George's Parade, Wolverhampton Central Library is a Grade II listed building, designed by architect Henry T. Hare and opened in 1902. It was originally commissioned to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee using funds raised by the Mayor, Alderman S Craddock, and by a grant of £1,000 from Andrew Carnegie. This new library improved public access to information and reading material, replacing its cramped predecessor in the old Garrick Street Police Station.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/leisure_culture/libraries/central_library/history.htm |title=History of Central Library |publisher=Wolverhampton City Council |accessdate=17 June 2008[/tpl]

==Sport==

===Football===

Wolverhampton is represented in League One, the third tier of English football, by Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. "Wolves", as they are known, are one of the oldest English football clubs, and were one of the 12 founder members of the Football League. Their most successful period was the 1950s, where they won three Football League Championships (then the highest division) and two FA Cups, and were involved in the earliest European friendlies. They were hailed by the press as "The Unofficial World Champions" after one of their most famous victories, against Budapest Honvéd FC of Hungary. They were also the first English team to play in the Soviet Union. These victories instigated the birth of the European Cup competition which later evolved into the UEFA Champions' League (see European Cup and Champions League history). The team also participated in the original United Soccer Association (progenitor of the NASL) in the United States in 1967. The team was based in Los Angeles as the Los Angeles Wolves, and won the league's championship that year.
In total, they have won three Football League titles (prior to the top division becoming the Premier League), four FA Cups, have two League Cup victories and many other minor honours, including reaching the UEFA Cup Final in 1972, and appearances in the last eight of both the UEFA European Cup, and the European Cup Winners' Cup, but spent just one season in the top division between 1984 and 2009.  They are also the only club to have won five different league titles; they have championed all four tiers of the professional English league, as well as the long-defunct northern section of the Third Division.
The club has been represented by numerous high profile players of the years, including Billy Wright, Bert Williams, Johnny Hancocks, Dicky Dorsett, John Richards, Geoff Palmer, Emlyn Hughes, Wayne Clarke, Steve Bull and academy products Robbie Keane, Joleon Lescott and Wayne Hennessey. Notable managers include Stan Cullis (who was once a player at the club), Bill McGarry, John Barnwell, Tommy Docherty, Graham Turner, Graham Taylor, Dave Jones, Glenn Hoddle and Mick McCarthy. Taylor and Hoddle had both managed the England national football team, Docherty had managed the Scotland national football team and McCarthy had managed the Republic of Ireland before their respective arrivals at Wolves.
Several other Wolverhampton based clubs play in the West Midlands (Regional) League, notably Wolverhampton Casuals F.C., AFC Wulfrunians, Wednesfield F.C., Goodrich F.C., Wolverhampton Sporting Community F.C. and Bilston Town F.C..

===Athletics===
