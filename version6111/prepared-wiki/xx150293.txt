Reserection EP was a 1995 release by French pop star Étienne Daho, working alongside English dance-pop band Saint Etienne. It was only released in France and Japan.
The "resurrection" of the title was a response to rumours at the time that Daho was HIV-positive, or even that he had already died.[tpl]cite web | author = |date=November 2005 | url = http://www.rfimusique.com/siteen/biographie/biographie_6168.asp | title = Biography: Étienne Daho | format = | work = | publisher = Radio France Internationale | accessdate = 2006-10-29 [/tpl] The opening track, "Reserection", puts the matter to rest as Daho states that he will rise from his "cendres fiction" (fictitious ashes) "encore et encore" (again and again).[tpl]cite web | author = Dorset, Mark and Anthony Bailey | date = June 29, 2002 | url = http://www.saint.etienne.net/saint/etienne?http://etienne.net/ec/Reserection.song.html | title = Lyrics: Reserection | work = | publisher = Saint Etienne Heaven | accessdate = 2006-10-29 [/tpl]
The only English song was "Accident", a reworked version of Daho's 1984 French-language hit single "Weekend à Rome", with original English lyrics. Daho's speech from "Reserection" is also reprised within the song. "Jungle Pulse" and "X Amours" are French-language reworkings of Saint Etienne's "Filthy" and "Paper" respectively.
Daho only released "Jungle Pulse" as a single at first, but later Eurodance producer Steve Rodway produced a remix of "Accident" that became "He's on the Phone", released as the single from Saint Etienne's first greatest hits compilation, Too Young to Die - The Singles.
The band later worked with Daho on the single "Le Premier Jour", from his greatest hits compilation Singles.
