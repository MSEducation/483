This is a list of the Maronite Patriarchs of Antioch, the primate of  the Maronite Church, one of the Eastern Catholic Churches.  After becoming patriarch, they assume the name "Peter" (Boutros in Arabic, بطرس ), after the first Bishop of Antioch, St. Peter, who was also the head of the Apostles.  The official title that the Maronite Patriarch assumes is "Patriarch of Antioch and All the East."
For the Patriarchs of Antioch before John Maron, see List of Patriarchs of Antioch.

==Maronite Patriarchs of Antioch, from John Maron==

A famous list of Maronite Patriarchs of Antioch was written and published by Giuseppe Simone Assemani,J.S.Assemani Serie chronologica Patriarchorum Antionchiae, edited and integrated by Joanne Darauni, Rome 1881 and Simon Awad, which follows the Series of Maronite Patriachs written by Patriarch Estephan El Douaihy in the 17th century,[tpl]cite book |last=Graf |first=Georg |authorlink=Georg Graf | title = Geschichte der christlichen arabischen Literatur, Volume 3 | publisher=Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana |year=1960 |chapter=90.5 |pages=371[/tpl] but it is incomplete for the first centuries.  Besides the Assemani's list, an other list more detailed was written in Bejjeh in 1766 by Georges Saad.[tpl]cite book | last = Dau| first = Butros| title =Religious, cultural and political history of the Maronites |year = 1984 | location=Lebanon |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7CbZAAAAMAAJ |pages=228–238[/tpl]
