==History==

===1992–97: Formation, signing with Sony Music, first three albums and international breakthrough===

The band name is a mix of "jam session" and "iroquai", based on the Iroquois, a Native American tribe.[tpl]cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-252859-bio--Jamiroquai |title=Jamiroquai Biography on Yahoo! Music |accessdate=4 October 2007 |first=Greg |last=Prato|publisher=Yahoo![/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] The original band was Jay Kay (vocals), Toby Smith (keyboard), Stuart Zender (bass), Nick Van Gelder (drums), Wallis Buchanan (didgeridoo) and Alec Moran (pipeau). These are the founding members of Jamiroquai and were involved in the writing and production of the first album. The line-up of the band has changed several times, and the longest serving and now core members of the band are lead singer and songwriter Jason "Jay" Kay, percussionist Sola Akingbola (since 1994), and drummer Derrick McKenzie (since 1994). Kay was the impetus behind the formation of Jamiroquai, deciding to form the band after an unsuccessful audition to become the singer of the Brand New Heavies. Although he has said that he has attempted to have Jamiroquai treated as a band, Kay has always been at the forefront.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
Jamiroquai's first single, "When You Gonna Learn", was released in 1992 on the Acid Jazz label.  Following its success, Kay signed an eight-album record deal with Sony Music Entertainment. The first Sony album, Emergency on Planet Earth was released in 1993. It was followed in 1994 by The Return of the Space Cowboy. The single "Space Cowboy" gained notice on the charts and in club rotation.
While Jamiroquai was growing in popularity in the UK, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, they remained relatively unknown to U.S and other international audiences. The band's American breakthrough came with the third album, Travelling Without Moving in 1996, which yielded two big hits, "Virtual Insanity" and "Cosmic Girl". The success of "Virtual Insanity" was due in part to its Jonathan Glazer-directed video, which featured Kay's dance moves and some physics-defying images.  At the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, the creative music video for "Virtual Insanity" won four awards; Best Video, Best Special Effects, Best Cinematography, and Breakthrough Video, and the band performed the song at the ceremony.1997 MTV Video Music Awards MTV.

===1998–2003: Synkronized, A Funk Odyssey and changes to style and line-up===

In 1998, Jamiroquai released "Deeper Underground", the first single from their fourth studio album, Synkronized, which also appeared in the soundtrack for the 1998 movie Godzilla. The acid jazz flavours and ethnic influences of the first three albums continued with the release of Synkronized, and Jay Kay's interest in funk and disco music were shifting the band's directions towards such. By their fifth album, A Funk Odyssey (2001), they had evolved so drastically, that some critics and listeners would remark they lost the 'Jamiroquai sound'. With the departure of more and more original band members, including Wallis Buchanan and his didgeridoo, Jamiroquai had become a very different band from that of 1992. In spite of the changes, the fifth album's first single, "Little L", reached No. 1 in many charts worldwide becoming their best dance hit.
In 2003, Jamiroquai compiled and mixed a DJ mix album for the Late Night Tales series for Azuli Records. The track selection shows some of the band's soul, funk and disco influences, including tracks from The Pointer Sisters, The Commodores, Johnny "Hammond" Smith and Johnny "Guitar" Watson.

===2004–06: Dynamite, High Times: Singles 1992–2006 and end of contract with Sony Music===

Their sixth album, titled Dynamite was released on 20 June 2005. It reached No. 3 on the UK charts. The first single, "Feels Just Like It Should" was released early in June, the second, "Seven Days in Sunny June" released on 15 August 2005, followed by the third, "(Don't) Give Hate A Chance" on 7 November 2005.
Jamiroquai released a greatest hits collection, High Times: Singles 1992-2006 in November 2006. The release of this album marked the end of Kay's eight-album contract with Sony.  The album reached the number 1 spot in the UK album chart after its first week of release. The album featured two new tracks, "Runaway" and "Radio". On 18 September 2006, "Runaway" was given its first play by UK radio stations. It was released as a single on 30 October 2006.   Kay remarked that compilation was released purely out of contractual obligation: "2006, they're out of the picture."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/mad-hatter/2005/11/24/1132703291988.html | title=Mad hatter | date=25 November 2005 | accessdate=29 November 2005 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald[/tpl]
Jamiroquai have had 13 nominations for The Brit Awards, and have yet to win one.

Future releases will appear under the Columbia imprint.[tpl]cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070301201754re_/www.jamiroquai.com/default.aspx?url=/news/detail.aspx?Parent%3dNews%26id%3d106 | title=Jamiroquai Switch to Columbia Records | date=17 March 2006 | accessdate=31 August 2006 | publisher=Official Jamiroquai website (archived) [/tpl]

After leaving Sony, the band began to work on their seventh project, and several collaborations and side-projects. In a very short mid-2007 interview with Jamirotalk, drummer Derick McKenzie expressed his satisfaction with leaving Sony as the beginning of a period in which the band will have more creative control over their own work, together with plenty of room for experimentation and lack of pressure from a record company.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jamirotalk.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7129 |title=International Jamiroquai Fan Discussion Forum |publisher=Jamirotalk |accessdate=13 September 2011[/tpl]

Despite both singles, "Blue Skies" and "White Knuckle Ride" reaching into Top 100 charts worldwide, the album sold a mere 34,378 copies on its debut, around half the number of the previous album, Dynamite. On 9 June 2011, the band released a new track called "Smile" for free download on their Soundcloud site.[tpl]cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/jamiroquai1/jamiroquai-smile |title=Official Jamiroquai Soundcloud Page |publisher=Soundcloud.com |accessdate=13 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] "Smile" has a sound similar to that of the early albums and has been met with high appraisal amongst fans and critics alike.[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl] The band ran a competition to choose the artwork for the cover, Jay picked the winning design which was by Australian designer Zbigniew Klej.

==Buffalo Man==

"Buffalo Man" is the name of the silhouette character featured on most of the covers of Jamiroquai's releases. The image was created sometime prior to the release of their 1992 single When You Gonna Learn. Allegedly it was originally sketched by the front-man Jason Kay, as Buffalo Man is seemingly a self portrait silhouette of Kay wearing a buffalo hat. It is based on the Minotaur from the Greek fable 'Theseus and the Minotaur'. Jay Kay stated "I really identify with Theseus. In fact, I'd say I am the most similar person to Theseus to come out of Stretford in the past 50 years." The mark has been used on almost every commercial (and sometimes non-commercial) release of the band's output in some form or another; usually the unique symbol is pictured unaltered, but there have been times where it is shown in a stylised manner to suit the artwork or song.[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Over the years, Buffalo Man has seen some temporary changes or interesting thematic uses:
"Half the Man", The Return of the Space Cowboy
For the single "Half The Man", Buffalo Man is on the cover as a keyring with a heart in the clasp representing the fact it is a love song and the keyring itself is split down the middle in two-halves to represent the song title.  Buffalo Man also has a silver heart.
"Space Cowboy", The Return of the Space Cowboy
For the single "Space Cowboy", Buffalo Man is present on the cover as a shaped cigarette paper for a half-complete cannabis joint, in reference to the song's praise of the drug.
"Virtual Insanity", Travelling Without Moving
For the single of "Virtual Insanity", Buffalo Man appears in the place of the Ferrari horse in an homage to Jason's love of sports cars. For the album cover to Travelling Without Moving, the artwork is similar, but takes on an embossed effect and is seen on a metal grille.
"Cosmic Girl", "Everyday"
For these two releases, Buffalo Man is pictured with a star over his heart and two intersecting orbital rings.
Synkronized
While the design remained fundamentally unaltered, Buffalo Man has been turned into a laser-cut mirror and photographed from interesting angles by Midori Tsukagoshi. On some editions, for the disc itself, no ink has been used on the character, but the same stone background found on the front cover has been used for the rest of the disc, thus allowing the consumer to recreate the photographed effect.
A Funk Odyssey
For this album, the Buffalo Man was notably absent from the cover; instead, the laser lights formed an outline of the Buffalo Man logo, which could be seen much more clearly in the album's liner notes.
Dynamite
The US release and the double-disc Australian Tour Edition featured a gold Buffalo Man. Other releases saw a picture of Jay Kay instead.
Rock Dust Light Star
The letter "i" in the title is replaced with the Buffalo Man, making the first appearance in a Jamiroquai album cover since 1999's Synkronized (not counting the alternative artwork for Dynamite). The US cover for the album features a glossy yellow Buffalo Man standing upon a glowing floor.[tpl]cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/rock-dust-light-star/id516385122 |title=iTunes – Music – Rock Dust Light Star by Jamiroquai |publisher=iTunes Store |date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=13 December 2012[/tpl] The vinyl release also features another cover including the Buffalo Man.
