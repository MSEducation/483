He went to St. John's and we had a mutual friend at my school and like two years later I saw him in the Sony building when I had just got signed and I bumped into him I was like 'Yo what's up what are you doing here?' and he's like 'Yo I just signed with Roc Nation' and I"m like 'Yo I just signed with J.
