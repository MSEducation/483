The watershed of the river is largely agricultural land, with undulating hills over a bed of limestone.  The river is a popular destination for fly fishing, in particular for varieties of bass.  Occasionally, recreational kayakers and canoeists can be found on tame day trips.  Water levels are Class I+ with possible mild class II.
