CATEGORIES: Academy Awards, Costume design, Awards for film costume design

The Academy Award for Best Costume Design is one of the Academy Awards of Merit presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for achievement in film costume design.[tpl]Cite web| url =http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule01.html | publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | title = Rule One: Awards Definitions | accessdate= August 23, 2011[/tpl]
The award was first given for films made in 1948.  Initially, separate award categories were established for black-and-white films and color films.  Since the merger of the two categories in 1967, the Academy has traditionally avoided giving out the award to contemporary films.[tpl]cite book|first=Deborah |last=Nadoolman Landis |title=Costume Design |publisher=Focal Press |year=2003 |page=72 |isbn=0-240-80590-9 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=86Ihna8-sLkC&pg=PA93&dq=academy+awards+costume+design#v=onepage&q=academy%20awards&f=false[/tpl]

==Award==

The Academy Award for Best Costume Design is given out annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences for the best achievement of film costume design of the previous year. Films that are eligible for the award must meet a series of criteria, including the requirement that the costumes must have been "conceived" by a costume designer. For this particular criteria, each submission is reviewed by the costume designer members of the Art Directors Branch prior to the ballot process. Further rules include that the nominee(s) be only the principal costume designer(s), that the five films that receive the highest amount of votes will become the ceremony's nominations for final voting, and that the final voting will only be undertaken by active and life members of the Academy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule10.html |title=Rule Ten: Special Rules for the Costume Design Award |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences |accessdate=August 23, 2011 |archiveurl=|archivedate= [/tpl]

==History==

The Academy Award for Best Costume Design was first given out at the 21st Academy Awards,[tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html | publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | title = History of the Academy Awards | accessdate= August 23, 2011[/tpl] held on March 24, 1949. The award had two subcategories, one for Black and white film and one for films in color.[tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/21st.html  | publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | title = The 21st Academy Awards (1949) | accessdate= September 4, 2011[/tpl] At the 30th Academy Awards, held on March 26, 1958, these two subcategories were merged into one, which was the result of the Academy reducing the number of competitive categories from 30 to 24.[tpl]Cite web| url =http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/30th.html | publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | title = The 30th Academy Awards (1958) | accessdate= September 4, 2011[/tpl] The 32nd Academy Awards saw the category again be split into two for recognition of both Black and white and color film. Eight years later, the Academy Award for Best Costume Design, along with two other awards, were each combined into their own single category recognizing achievement in film.[tpl]Cite web| url =http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/40th.html | publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | title = The 40th Academy Awards (1968) | accessdate= September 4, 2011[/tpl]
From 1949 to 1966, most Academy Awards for Best Costume Design in Black and White were given to a contemporary movie. On the other hand, epics, fantasies, and musicals dominated the color category. Since the merger into one singular category for color films in 1967, films set in modern times have won only twice, despite the majority of those nominated being contemporary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.costumedesignersguild.com/press-room/motion-picture-academy-awards-best-costume-design.pdf |title=Motion Picture Academy Awards - Costume Design |publisher=Costume Designers Guild |accessdate=August 23, 2011 |archiveurl=|archivedate= [/tpl]
Which the 2 modern time winners were Travels with My Aunt and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.
