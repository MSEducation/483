AmericanConnection is a flight connection service brand name for the spoke-hub of U.S. mainline carrier  American Airlines, under which regional airline operator Chautauqua Airlines operates feeder flights for American Airlines at its Chicago hub. Mainline carriers often use regional airlines to operate services in order to increase frequency, serve routes that would not sustain larger aircraft, or for other competitive reasons. American Airlines also uses affiliated companies (corporations under common ownership) operating under the American Eagle brand to provide regional service to its other hubs in addition to the AmericanConnection service operated by Chautauqua Airlines.
On April 6, 2010, American moved all existing AmericanConnection operations to Chicago-O'Hare as part of its restructuring plan, eliminating service by AmericanConnection at Lambert-St. Louis.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl]
AmericanConnection operates over 180 flights a day to 21 destinations. AmericanConnection is an affiiate member of the Oneworld airline alliance.

==History==

Most of the AmericanConnection carriers previously operated under a marketing agreement with TWA Trans World Airlines as TWE Trans World Express  banner carriers and later as TWC Trans World Connection marketing during the merger acquistion transition between TWA and American.
RegionsAir operated as AmericanConnection until March 2007 and Trans States Airlines operated as AmericanConnection until May 2009.
Though not associated with TWA as many of former AmericanConnection airlines were, Business Express Airlines was yet another air carrier which flew under the AmericanConnection marketing banner. Prior to its acquisition by AMR Corporation and its integration into the American Eagle destinations route network, Business Express linked many smaller localities directly to American Airlines's expansive national and worldwide route network.

==Discontinuation of the marketing brand==

On September 12, 2012 AMR Corporation, announced it would be discontinuing the AmericanConnection marketing brand and revert to using the sole marketing brand of American Eagle for its feeder services to small cities it contracts regional airlines to perform.Sky Talk: Eagle won't fly American feed out of LAX, closing pilot and flight attendant base.
