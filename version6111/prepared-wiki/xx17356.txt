In mathematics, an injective function or injection or one-to-one function is a function that preserves distinctness: it never maps distinct elements of its domain to the same element of its codomain. In other words, every element of the function's codomain is the image of at most one element of its domain. The term one-to-one function must not to be confused with one-to-one correspondence (aka  surjective injection or bijective function), which uniquely maps all elements in both domain and codomain to each other, (see figures).
Occasionally, an injective function from X to Y is denoted [tpl]nowrap|f: X ↣ Y[/tpl], using an arrow with a barbed tail ([tpl]unichar|21A3|RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH TAIL|ulink=Unicode[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web| title = Unicode| url = http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2190.pdf| accessdate = 2013-05-11[/tpl] The set of injective functions from X to Y may be denoted YX using a notation derived from that used for falling factorial powers, since if X and Y are finite sets with respectively m and n elements, the number of injections from X to Y is nm (see the twelvefold way).
A function f that is not injective is sometimes called many-to-one. However, this terminology is also sometimes used to mean "single-valued", i.e., each argument is mapped to at most one value.
A monomorphism is a generalization of an injective function in category theory.

==Definition==

Let f be a function whose domain is a set A. The function f is injective if and only if for all a and b in A, if f(a) = f(b), then a = b; that is, f(a) = f(b) implies a = b.  Equivalently, if a ≠ b, then f(a) ≠ f(b).
Symbolically,
which is logically equivalent to the contrapositive,

==Examples==

More generally, when X and Y are both the real line R, then an injective function f : R → R is one whose graph is never intersected by any horizontal line more than once. This principle is referred to as the horizontal line test.

==Injections can be undone==

Functions with left inverses are always injections. That is, given f : X → Y, if there is a function g : Y → X such that, for every x ∈ X  
then f is injective. In this case, g is called a retraction of f. Conversely, f is called a section of g. 
Conversely, every injection f with non-empty domain has a left inverse g (in conventional mathematicsThis principle is valid in conventional mathematics, but may fail in constructive mathematics. For instance, a left inverse of the inclusion {0,1} → R of the two-element set in the reals violates indecomposability by giving a retraction of the real line to the set {0,1}.). Note that g may not be a complete inverse of f because the composition in the other order, [tpl]Nowrap|f o g[/tpl], may not be the identity on Y. In other words, a function that can be undone or "reversed", such as f, is not necessarily invertible (bijective). Injections are "reversible" but not always invertible.
Although it is impossible to reverse a non-injective (and therefore information-losing) function, one can at least obtain a "quasi-inverse" of it, that is a multiple-valued function.

==Injections may be made invertible==

In fact, to turn an injective function f : X → Y into a bijective (hence invertible) function, it suffices to replace its codomain Y by its actual range J = f(X). That is, let g : X → J such that g(x) = f(x) for all x in X; then g is bijective. Indeed, f can be factored as [tpl]Nowrap| inclJ,Y o g[/tpl], where inclJ,Y is the inclusion function from J into Y.

==Proving that functions are injective==

A proof that a function ƒ is injective depends on how the function is presented and what properties the function holds.
For functions that are given by some formula there is a basic idea.
We use the contrapositive of the definition of injectivity, namely that if ƒ(x) = ƒ(y), then x = y.[tpl]cite web|last=Williams|first=Peter|title=Proving Functions One-to-One|url=http://www.math.csusb.edu/notes/proofs/bpf/node4.html[/tpl] 
Here is an example:
Proof: Let ƒ : X → Y.  Suppose ƒ(x) = ƒ(y).  So 2x + 3 = 2y + 3 => 2x = 2y => x = y.  Therefore it follows from the definition that ƒ is injective. Q.E.D.
There are multiple other methods of proving that a function is injective.  For example, in calculus if ƒ is differentiable, then it is sufficient to show that the derivative is always positive or always negative.  In linear algebra, if ƒ is a linear transformation it is sufficient to show that the kernel of ƒ contains only the zero vector.  If ƒ is a function with finite domain it is sufficient to look through the list of images of each domain element and check that no image occurs twice on the list.
