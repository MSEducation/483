The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS; [tpl]lang-rus|Содружество Независимых Государств, СНГ|r=Sodruzhestvo Nezavisimykh Gosudarstv, SNG[/tpl]) (also called the Russian Commonwealth)[tpl]ref|a[/tpl] is a regional organisation whose participating countries are former Soviet Republics, formed during the breakup of the Soviet Union.
The CIS is a loose association of states. Although the CIS has few supranational powers, it is aimed at being more than a purely symbolic organisation, nominally possessing coordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking, and security. It has also promoted cooperation on cross-border crime prevention. Some of the members of the CIS have established the Eurasian Economic Community with the aim of creating a fully fledged common market.

==History==

The organisation was founded on 8 December 1991 by the Republic of Belarus, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine, when the leaders of the three countries met in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha Natural Reserve, about [tpl]convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] north of Brest in Belarus and signed a Creation Agreement ([tpl]lang-ru|Соглашение[/tpl], Soglasheniye) on the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the creation of CIS as a successor entity to it.Agreement on the Establishment of the CIS: 3 founding countries, 8 December 1991 (unofficial English translation). Russian text here http://www.cis.minsk.by/main.aspx?uid=176 At the same time they announced that the new alliance would be open to all republics of the former Soviet Union, and to other nations sharing the same goals. The CIS charter stated that all the members were sovereign and independent nations and thereby effectively abolished the Soviet Union.
On 21 December 1991, the leaders of eight additional former Soviet Republics – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan – signed the Alma-Ata Protocol and joined the CIS, thus bringing the number of participating countries to 11.Alma-Ata Declaration: 11 countries accede to the CIS, 21 December 1991 (English translation). Russian text here http://www.cis.minsk.by/main.aspx?uid=178 Georgia joined two years later, in December 1993. At this point, 12 former Soviet Republics (all except the Baltic States) participated in the CIS.
Between 2003 and 2005, three CIS member states experienced a change of government in a series of colour revolutions: Eduard Shevardnadze was overthrown in Georgia; Viktor Yushchenko was elected in Ukraine; and Askar Akayev was toppled in Kyrgyzstan. In February 2006, Georgia withdrew from the Council of Defense Ministers, with the statement that "Georgia has taken a course to join NATO and it cannot be part of two military structures simultaneously",[tpl]cite web|author=03.02.2006 |url=http://english.pravda.ru/news/world/03-02-2006/75406-georgia-0 |title=Georgia opts out of ex-Soviet military cooperation body |publisher=Pravda.Ru |date=11 September 2001 |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20060203/43324440.html |title=RIA Novosti - World - Georgia's quitting CIS council will not affect security - Russian minister |publisher=En.rian.ru |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl] but it remained a full member of the CIS until August 2009, one year after officially withdrawing in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 South Ossetia war. In March 2007, Igor Ivanov, the secretary of the Russian Security Council, expressed his doubts concerning the usefulness of the CIS, emphasising that the Eurasian Economic Community was becoming a more competent organisation to unify the largest countries of the CIS.Russia questions further existence of the CIS post-soviet organisation InfoNIAC Following the withdrawal of Georgia, the presidents of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan skipped the October 2009 meeting of the CIS[tpl]Why|date=September 2012[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|last=Pannier |first=Bruce |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Russia_Facing_Resistance_With_Allies_On_CISs_Southern_Flank/1847880.html |title=Russia Facing Resistance With Allies On CIS's Southern Flank |publisher=Rferl.org |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl]
In May 2009, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine joined the Eastern Partnership, a project which was initiated by the European Union (EU).

==Membership==

There are nine full member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The Creation Agreement remained the main constituent document of the CIS until January 1993, when the CIS Charter ([tpl]lang-ru|Устав[/tpl], Ustav) was adopted.CIS Charter, 22 January 1993 (unofficial English translation). Russian text here The charter formalised the concept of membership: a member country is defined as a country that ratifies the CIS Charter (sec. 2, art. 7). Turkmenistan has not ratified the charter and changed its CIS standing to associate member as of 26 August 2005 in order to be consistent with its UN-recognised international neutrality status.Decision on Turkmenistan's associate membership, CIS Executive Committee meeting in Kazan, Russia, 26 August 2005 [tpl]Ru icon[/tpl].Turkmenistan reduces CIS ties to "Associate Member", Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 29 August 2005. Although Ukraine was one of the three founding countries and ratified the Creation Agreement in December 1991, Ukraine did not choose to ratify the CIS Charter as it disagrees with Russia being the only legal successor of the Soviet Union. Thus it does not regard itself as a member of the CIS.Ratification status of CIS documents as of 15 January 2008 (Russian)September 2008 Statement by Foreign Minister of Ukraine Volodymyr Ohryzko, “Ukraine does not recognise the legal personality of this organisation, we are not members of the CIS Economic Court, we did not ratify the CIS Statute, thus, we cannot be considered a member of this organisation from international legal point of view. Ukraine is a country-participant, but not a member country”

===Participating states===

Although Ukraine was one of the three founding countries and ratified the Creation Agreement in December 1991, Ukraine did not choose to ratify the CIS Charter.http://books.google.com/books?id=O-v2Uhprr7cC&pg=PA44&dq=Ukraine+did+not+choose+to+ratify+the+CIS+Charter&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=PLSgUqm1McGR1AX16IGwAw&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Ukraine%20did%20not%20choose%20to%20ratify%20the%20CIS%20Charter&f=falsehttp://books.google.com/books?id=to6U__f00b8C&pg=PA16&dq=Ukraine+founding+countries+CIS&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=07SgUvqLIIHJ0AWo2oCwBQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Ukraine%20founding%20countries%20CIS&f=false In 1993 Ukraine became an "Associate Member" of CIS.http://books.google.com/books?id=0IMaWuaYRnQC&pg=PA142&dq=CIS+Ukraine+membership&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=urWgUtGoNMLD0QWcwoGgAg&ved=0CHUQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=CIS%20Ukraine%20membership&f=false

==Human rights==

Since its inception, one of the primary goals of the CIS has been to provide a forum for discussing issues related to the social and economic development of the newly independent states. To achieve this goal member states have agreed to promote and protect human rights. Initially efforts to achieve this goal consisted merely of statements of good will, but on 26 May 1995, the CIS adopted a Commonwealth of Independent States Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/type,MULTILATERALTREATY,CIS,RUS,49997ae32c,0.html|title=Commonwealth of Independent States Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms|year=1995|accessdate=24 March 2013[/tpl]
Even before the 1995 human rights treaty, the Charter of the CIS that was adopted in 1991 created, in article 33, a Human Rights Commission sitting in Minsk, Belarus. This was confirmed by decision of the Council of Heads of States of the CIS in 1993. In 1995, the CIS adopted a human rights treaty that includes civil and political as well as social and economic human rights. This treaty entered into force in 1998. The CIS treaty is modeled on the European Convention on Human Rights, but lacking the strong implementation mechanisms of the latter. In the CIS treaty, the Human Rights Commission has very vaguely defined authority. The Statute of the Human Rights Commission, however, also adopted by the CIS Member States as a decision, gives the Commission the right to receive inter-state as well as individual communications.
The CIS treaty offers some valuable innovations that are not found in other organisations. Especially regional human rights treaties such as the European Convention on Human Rights in terms of the human rights it protects and the means of protection. These include the combination of social and economic rights and rights to professional education and citizenship. It also offers former Soviet Union states the opportunity to deal with human rights matters within a more familiar cultural setting.
However, CIS members, especially in Central Asia, continue to have among the world's poorest human rights records. Many activists point to the 2005 Andijan massacre in Uzbekistan, or the cult of personality around President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow of Turkmenistan, to show that there has been almost no improvement in human rights since the collapse of the Soviet Union in Central Asia. The consolidation of power by President Vladmir Putin has resulted in a steady decline in the modest progress of previous years in Russia. The Commonwealth of Independent States continues to face serious challenges in meeting even basic international standards.[ref]

==Military structures==

The CIS Charter establishes the Council of Ministers of Defense, which is vested with the task of coordinating military cooperation of the CIS member states. To this end, the Council develops conceptual approaches to the questions of military and defense policy of the CIS member states; develops proposals aimed to prevent armed conflicts on the territory of the member states or with their participation; gives expert opinions on draft treaties and agreements related to the questions of defense and military developments; issues related suggestions and proposals to the attention of the CIS Council of the Heads of State. Also important is the Council's work on approximation of the legal acts in the area of defense and military development.
An important manifestation of integration processes in the area of military and defense collaboration of the CIS member states is the creation, in 1995, of the joint CIS Air Defense System. Over the years, the military personnel of the joint CIS Air Defense System grew twofold along the western, European border of the CIS, and by 1.5 times, on its southern borders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cis.minsk.by/page.php?id=200 |title=Информация о Совете министров обороны государств – участников Содружества Независимых Государств |publisher=Cis.minsk.by |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl]
When Boris Yeltsin became Russian Defence Minister on 7 May 1992, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the man appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the CIS Armed Forces, and his staff, were ejected from the MOD and General Staff buildings and given offices in the former Warsaw Pact Headquarters at 41 Leningradsky ProspektJohnson's Russia List #2142, 9 April 1998 on the northern outskirts of Moscow.Odom, The Collapse of the Soviet Military, p.385-86 Shaposhnikov resigned in June 1993.

===Free trade area (CISFTA)===

====1994====

In 1994, the CIS countries "agreed" to create a free trade area (FTA), but the agreements were never signed. The 1994 agreement would have covered all twelve then CIS members except Turkmenistan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldtradelaw.net/fta/agreements/cisfta.pdf |title=Free Trade Agreement Between Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Kazakhstan, The Russian Federation, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan And The Kyrgyz Republic |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl]

===Eurasian Economic Community===

The Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC or EAEC) originated from a customs union between Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan on 29 March 1996.WTO WT/REG71/1 It was named the EAEC on 10 October 2000[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldtradelaw.net/fta/agreements/eaecfta.pdf |title=Foundation Agreement Of Eaec Agreement On Foundation Of Eurasian Economic Community |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl] when Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan signed the treaty. EurAsEC was formally created when the treaty was finally ratified by all five member states in May 2001. Armenia, Moldova and Ukraine hold observer status. EurAsEC is working on establishing a common energy market and exploring the more efficient use of water in central Asia.

===Organisation of Central Asian Cooperation===

Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan formed the OCAC in 1991 as Central Asian Commonwealth (CAC). The organisation continued in 1994 as the Central Asian Economic Union (CAEU), in which Tajikistan and Turkmenistan did not participate. In 1998 it became the Central Asian Economic Cooperation (CAEC), which marked the return of Tajikistan. On 28 February 2002 it was renamed to its current name. Russia joined on 28 May 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ecetrade.typepad.com/Central%20Asian%20Cooperation%20Organization%20basic%20info.doc |title=Central Asian Cooperation Organisation |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl] On 7 October 2005 it was decided between the member states that Uzbekistan will join[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20051110/42053167.html |title=Working group discusses Uzbekistan's accession to EurAsEC |publisher=En.rian.ru |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl] the Eurasian Economic Community and that the organisations will merge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://centralasia.foreignpolicyblogs.com/collective-security-organization-timeline/ |title=Collective Security: A Timeline |publisher=Centralasia.foreignpolicyblogs.com |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl] The organisations joined on 25 January 2006. It is not clear what will happen to the status of current CACO observers that are not observers to EurAsEC (Georgia and Turkey).

===Common Economic Space===

After discussion about the creation of a common economic space between the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, agreement in principle about the creation of this space was announced after a meeting in the Moscow suburb of Novo-Ogarevo on 23 February 2003. The Common Economic Space would involve a supranational commission on trade and tariffs that would be based in Kiev, would initially be headed by a representative of Kazakhstan, and would not be subordinate to the governments of the four nations. The ultimate goal would be a regional organisation that would be open for other countries to join as well, and could eventually lead even to a single currency.
On 22 May 2003, the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian Parliament) voted 266 votes in favour and 51 against the joint economic space. However, most believe that Viktor Yushchenko's victory in the Ukrainian presidential election of 2004 was a significant blow against the project: Yushchenko has shown renewed interest in Ukrainian membership in the European Union and such membership would be incompatible with the envisioned common economic space. Yushchenko's successor Viktor Yanukovych stated on 27 April 2010 "Ukraine's entry into the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan is not possible today, since the economic principles and the laws of the WTO do not allow it, we develop our policy in accordance with WTO principles". Ukraine is a WTO member.Yanukovych: Ukraine won't join Customs Union, Kyiv Post (27 April 2010)
A Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia was thus created in 2010,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rbcnews.com/free/20081225170003.shtml |title=Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus plan on common economic space |publisher=Rbcnews.com |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl] with a single market envisioned for 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/exsoviet/20100617/159463469.html |title=Russia expects CIS countries to create free trade area |publisher=En.rian.ru |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl]

===Collective Security Treaty Organisation===

The Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) (Russian: Организация Договора о Коллективной Безопасности) or simply the Tashkent Treaty (Russian: Ташкентский договор) first began as the CIS Collective Security TreatyThe Charter of the CSTO[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] which was signed on 15 May 1992, by Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, in the city of Tashkent. Azerbaijan signed the treaty on 24 September 1993, Georgia on 9 December 1993 and Belarus on 31 December 1993. The treaty came into effect on 20 April 1994.
The CST was set to last for a 5-year period unless extended. On 2 April 1999, only six members of the CSTO signed a protocol renewing the treaty for another five-year period, while Azerbaijan, Georgia and Uzbekistan refused to sign, and withdrew from the treaty instead; together with Moldova and Ukraine, formed a non-aligned, more pro-Western pro-US group known as the "GUAM" (Georgia, Uzbekistan / Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Moldova). The organisation was named CSTO on 7 October 2002 in Tashkent. Nikolai Bordyuzha was appointed secretary general of the new organisation. During 2005, the CSTO partners conducted some common military exercises. In 2005, Uzbekistan withdrew from GUAM, and on 23 June 2006, Uzbekistan became a full participant in the CSTO and its membership was formally ratified by its parliament on 28 March 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurasianhome.org |title=Евразийский дом - информационно-аналитический портал |publisher=Eurasianhome.org |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl] The CSTO is an observer organisation at the United Nations General Assembly.
The charter reaffirmed the desire of all participating states to abstain from the use or threat of force. Signatories would not be able to join other military alliances or other groups of states, while aggression against one signatory would be perceived as an aggression against all. To this end, the CSTO holds yearly military command exercises for the CSTO nations to have an opportunity to improve inter-organisation cooperation. The largest-scale CSTO military exercise held to date were the "Rubezh 2008" exercises hosted in Armenia where a combined total of 4,000 troops from all 7 constituent CSTO member countries conducted operative, strategic, and tactical training with an emphasis towards furthering efficiency of the collective security element of the CSTO partnership.“Rubezh 2008”: The First Large-Scale CSTO Military Exercise | PfP Information Management System (PIMS)[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]
In May 2007, the CSTO secretary-general Nikolai Bordyuzha suggested Iran could join the CSTO saying, "The CSTO is an open organisation. If Iran applies in accordance with our charter, we will consider the application."[tpl]cite web|last=Chossudovsky |first=Michel |url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=5696 |title=Iran invited to join Central Security Treaty Organisation |publisher=Globalresearch.ca |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl] If Iran joined, it would be the first state outside the former Soviet Union to become a member of the organisation.
On 6 October 2007, CSTO members agreed to a major expansion of the organisation which would create a CSTO peacekeeping force that could deploy under a UN mandate or without one in its member states. The expansion would also allow all members to purchase Russian weapons at the same price as Russia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p812422/CIS_CSTO_Russia_Lebedev/ |title=Gendarme of Eurasia - Kommersant Moscow |publisher=Kommersant.com |date= |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl] CSTO signed an agreement with the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), in the Tajik capital Dushanbe, to broaden cooperation on issues such as security, crime, and drug trafficking.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C10%5C06%5Cstory_6-10-2007_pg4_3 |title=Leading News Resource of Pakistan |publisher=Daily Times |date=6 October 2007 |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl]

==Other activities==

===Controversial election observation mission===

The CIS Election Monitoring Organisation ([tpl]lang-ru|Миссия наблюдателей от СНГ на выборах[/tpl]) is an election monitoring body that was formed in October 2002, following a Commonwealth of Independent States heads of states meeting which adopted the Convention on the Standards of Democratic Elections, Electoral Rights, and Freedoms in the Member States of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The CIS-EMO has been sending election observers to member countries of the CIS since this time; they approved many elections which have been heavily criticised by independent observers.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21548933 |accessdate=19 May 2012 |title=Election fraud: How to steal an election |work=The Economist |date=3 March 2012[/tpl]

===Russian language status===

Russia has been urging that the Russian language receives official status in all of the CIS member states. So far Russian is an official language in only four of these states: Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Russian is also considered an official language in the region of Transnistria, and the autonomous region of Gagauzia in Moldova. Viktor Yanukovych, the Moscow-supported presidential candidate in the controversial 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, declared his intention to make Russian an official second language of Ukraine. However, Viktor Yushchenko, the winner, did not do so. After his early 2010 election as President Yanukovych stated (on 9 March 2010) that "Ukraine will continue to promote the Ukrainian language as its only state language".Yanukovych: Ukraine will not have second state language, Kyiv Post (9 March 2010)

===Sports events===

At the time of the Soviet Union's dissolution in December 1991, its sports teams had been invited to or qualified for various 1992 sports events. A joint CIS team took its place in some of these. The "Unified Team" competed in the 1992 Winter Olympics and 1992 Summer Olympics, and a CIS association football team competed in UEFA Euro 1992. A CIS bandy team played some friendlies in January 1992 and made its last appearance at the 1992 Russian Government Cup, where it also played against the new Russia national bandy team. The Soviet Union bandy championship for 1991–1992 was rebranded as a CIS championship.
Since then, CIS members have each competed separately in international sport.
