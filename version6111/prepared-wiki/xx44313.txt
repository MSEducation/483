The demoscene is a computer art subculture that specializes in producing demos, which are audio-visual presentations that run in real-time on a computer. The main goal of a demo is to show off programming, artistic, and musical skills.
The demoscene first appeared during the 8-bit era on computers such as the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Atari 800 and Amstrad CPC, and came to prominence during the rise of the 16/32-bit home computers (mainly the Amiga and Atari ST). In the early years, demos had a strong connection with software cracking.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=vague statement|date=March 2012[/tpl] When a cracked program was started, the cracker or his team would take credit with a graphical introduction called a "crack intro" (shortened cracktro). Within a year or two,CSDb - The First Demo Disk Collection for the Commodore 64 by Ash & Dave and Ian & Mic and Ikari and Reptilia Design (1988) the making of intros and standalone demos evolved into a new subculture independent of the software (piracy) scene.http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=1667
