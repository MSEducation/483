The SIAI-Marchetti S.205 is an Italian four-seat, single-engine, light airplane, manufactured by SIAI-Marchetti. The S.205 made its maiden flight in 1965. The Italian Air Force employs a version called S.208.

==Development==

The S.205 was the brainchild of the SIAI-Marchetti head designer Alexander Brena in 1964. Brena wanted to make a light, general-purpose aircraft, which led to the S.205. The aircraft was all-metal, low-winged, single-engined and provided space for four persons. Further development led into the S.208, which had a 260 hp engine, retractable landing gear, and 5 seats. Other planned, but never realized versions were the S.206 and S.210.
The first produced aircraft, the S.205-18F, flew in the February 1966 and deliveries began the following year. Production ceased in 1975, but between 1977 and 1980 a further 140 S.205-20Rs were produced to satisfy an order emitted from the Italian flying club AeroClub Italia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Approximately 65 fuselages were transported to the United States, to be assembled in Syracuse, New York by the Waco Aircraft Company. Initially the aircraft was called WACO Sirrus (4 -seat) and later VELA S220 (5-seat),[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] but with the death of Mr. Berger, the president of the company, the assembly of the S.205 came to a halt in the USA.

==Operational history==

The Italian Air Force acquired 45 aircraft for use as liaison, glider-towing, and training aircraft. The military version, called S.208M, differed from the civil version through its avionics, its two doors for the cockpit, the possibility to mount a hook to tow the gliders and the lack of some fuel tanks. The first 4 delivered aircraft were S.205s, but were later converted into S.208s.
Two aircraft were also sold to Tunisia, who used them for pilot training.SIAI-Marchetti S 208
