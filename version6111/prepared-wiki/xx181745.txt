The Mississippi Commission for Volunteer Service is the state agency in Mississippi that oversees national service programs and a growing network of Volunteer Centers.  Its mission: to engage and support volunteers of all ages and backgrounds in service to their communities.  Like its sister agencies in the other 49 states, the Mississippi Commission (MCVS) passes through federal funds from the Corporation for National and Community Service to Mississippi nonprofits to host AmeriCorps programs.
MCVS is led by a board of 24 Governor-appointed Commissioners who guide the general direction of the agency and who have fiduciary and programmatic responsibility for the MCVS's portfolio.  A staff of 17 work on AmeriCorps, disability inclusion, and the Volunteer Center network.  Administrative, fiscal, and training staff support these programs. http://www.mcvs.org
