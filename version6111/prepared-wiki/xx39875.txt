MSNBC (stylized as msnbc) is an American basic cable and satellite   channel that provides news coverage and political opinion on current events. It is owned by the NBCUniversal News Group, a unit of the NBCUniversal Television Group division of NBCUniversal. Its name was derived from the most common abbreviations for Microsoft and the National Broadcasting Company.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/MSNBC.html |title=MSNBC |publisher=Acronym Finder |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11[/tpl]

Beginning in the mid-2000s, MSNBC's opinion programming increasingly reflected its concept of political progressivism. In October 2010, it publicly acknowledged this with a marketing campaign it called "Lean Forward".Cable Channel Nods to Ratings and Leans Left. The New York Times. Published November 6, 2007.

==Development==

MSNBC was established by NBC executive Tom Rogers. Rogers was instrumental in developing the strategic partnership with Microsoft, which invested $221 million for a 50% share of the cable channel.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1996-07-14/network-meets-net|title=NETWORK MEETS NET How big an audience is there for Microsoft and NBC's cable-Web news venture? |journal= Businessweek|date= 15 July 1996[/tpl] MSNBC and Microsoft would share the cost of a $200 million newsroom in Secaucus, New Jersey, for msnbc.com. The network took over the channel space of NBC's 18-month-old America's Talking network, though in most cases cable carriage had to be negotiated with providers who never carried AT.

==Early history==

MSNBC was launched on July 15, 1996. The first show, which was anchored by Jodi Applegate, broadcast a lineup of news, interviews, and opinions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://home.ease.lsoft.com/scripts/wa-home.exe?A2=ind0404a&L=wnn&T=0&P=1941 |title=Jodi Jodi Applegate WNYW biography |publisher=Home.ease.lsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11[/tpl] During the day, rolling news coverage continued with The Contributors, a show that featured Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham, as well as interactive programming coordinated by Applegate, John Gibson and John Seigenthaler. Stories were generally longer and more detailed than the stories running on CNN at the time. NBC also highlighted their broadcast connections by airing stories direct from the NBC network affiliates, along with breaking news coverage from the same sources.[tpl]cite book|last=Collins|first=Scott|title=Crazy Like A Fox: The Inside Story of How Fox News Beat CNN|isbn=1-59184-029-5[/tpl]
Gradually, MSNBC began to put more emphasis on politics.[tpl]cite news|last=Moss|first=Linda|title=MSNBC Shifts Shows|publisher=Cable World|date=July 2, 2001[/tpl] The Project for Excellence in Journalism found in 2007 after a seven-year survey of cable channels that "MSNBC is moving to make politics a brand, with a large dose of opinion and personality."The State of the News Media 2007: Public Attitudes. Project for Excellence in Journalism. In January 2001, Mike Barnicle got a show on MSNBC, but it was canceled in June 2001 due to high production costs.E! Online, Bits and Pieces, June 26, 2001. In June, in a sign of continuing trouble at MSNBC, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said that he would not have started MSNBC if he knew then what he knows now (referencing the longstanding troubles in increasing viewership).Ballmer: Would not launch MSNBC again. CNET News.Com, June 7, 2001. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, MSNBC served as an outlet for NBC News to provide up-to-the-minute coverage, in contrast to broadcast NBC's longer stories. CNBC and CNBC Europe, with little financial news to report, ran MSNBC for many hours of the day following the attacks. The year also boosted the profile of Ashleigh Banfield, who had escaped injury while covering the World Trade Center on September 11. Her Region In Conflict program capitalized on her newfound celebrity and showcased exclusive interviews from Afghanistan.
On December 23, 2005, it was announced that NBC Universal would acquire an additional 32% share of the television channel from Microsoft, solidifying its control over television operations and allowing NBC to further consolidate MSNBC's backroom operations with NBC News and its other cable properties. msnbc.com (the website was a separate corporate entity from the television channel) would continue to be 50% owned by both NBC and Microsoft, and its operations would be largely unaffected. NBC would have the option, which it exercised, to buy the remaining 18% share of the television from Microsoft after two years. MSNBC, along with other U.S. news networks, had been criticized for having a distorted and biased media coverage of the Iraq War. The network began from 2005 onward to attract liberal and progressive viewers when host Keith Olbermann began critiquing and satirizing conservative media commentators on his program Countdown With Keith Olbermann. Olbermann especially focused his attention to Fox News Channel and its main primetime commentator, Bill O'Reilly.
On June 7, 2006, Rick Kaplan resigned as president of MSNBC, after holding the post for two years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/rick-kaplan-exits-effective-immediately-president-of-msnbc-steps-down_b9986|title=Rick Kaplan Exits: Effective Immediately, President Of MSNBC Steps Down|year=2006|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl] Following the announcement, it was announced on June 12, 2006, that Dan Abrams, a nine-year veteran of MSNBC and NBC News, had been named general manager of MSNBC, effective immediately. NBC News senior vice president Phil Griffin would oversee MSNBC, while also continuing to oversee NBC News’ Today, and Abrams would report to Griffin.
On June 29, 2006, Abrams announced a revamp to MSNBC's early-primetime and primetime schedule. On July 10, Tucker (formerly The Situation with Tucker Carlson) started airing at 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. ET (taking over Abrams' old timeslot), while Rita Cosby's Live & Direct was taken off the schedule. Cosby was instead given the role of primary anchor for MSNBC Investigates at 10 and 11 p.m. ET, a new program that took over Cosby and Carlson's timeslots. According to the press release, MSNBC Investigates promised to "...complement MSNBC's existing programming by building on channel's library of award winning documentaries."[tpl]cite web|url=http://nbcumv.com/release_detail.nbc/msnbc-20060629000000-msnbcannouncesprim.html|title=MSNBC Announcement|date=2006-06-29|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The move to taped programming during 10 and 11 p.m. was likely a result of the success that MSNBC saw with their Friday "experiment" of replacing all primetime programming with taped specials. On September 24, 2007, Abrams announced that he would leave the position of General Manager to focus on his 9:00 p.m. ET talk show, "Live With Dan Abrams". Oversight of MSNBC is now provided by Phil Griffin, a senior vice president at NBC.[tpl]cite news|last=Kurtz|first=Howard|title=MSNBC's Abrams Quits His Day Job|publisher=The Washington Post|date=September 25, 2007|page=C03|authorlink=Howard Kurtz[/tpl]
MSNBC and NBC News began broadcasting from their new studios at NBC's 30 Rockefeller Center complex in New York City on October 22, 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/nbc-news-to-begin-broadcasting-from-new-world-headquarters-oct-22_b16529|title=NBC News to Begin Broadcasting from New World Headquarters|date=2007-10-22|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl] After extensive renovations of the associated studios, NBC essentially merged its entire news operation into one building, and all MSNBC broadcasts, as well as NBC Nightly News, originate from the new studios. More than 12.5 hours of live television across the NBC News family originate from the New York studios daily. MSNBC is also expected to expand West Coast operations, as the channel recently[tpl]When|date=February 2011[/tpl] announced new studios near the Universal Studios lot, which will assemble all NBC West Coast news operations in one building.s MSNBC's master control did not make the move to 30 Rock. It remained in the old Secaucus headquarters until it completed its move to the NBC Universal Network Origination Center located inside the CNBC Global Headquarters building in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, on December 21, 2007. Shortly thereafter, Major League Baseball firmed up a long-term lease of the former MSNBC building to become the home studios of MLB Network, which launched from the facility on January 1, 2009.

==Changes since 2008==

From mid-2007 to mid-2008, MSNBC received a large increase in its ratings.[tpl]cite news |last=Kurtz |first=Howard |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/27/AR2008052703047_pf.html |title=MSNBC, Leaning Left And Getting Flak From Both Sides |work=The Washington Post |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2008-08-28 [/tpl] Primetime viewings increased by 61% over that time. In May 2008, NBC News president Steve Capus said that "It used to be people didn't have to worry about MSNBC because it was an also-ran cable channel.... That's not the case anymore." Tim Russert's sudden death in June 2008 removed what The Wall Street Journal called the "rudder for the network" and led to a period of transition.MSNBC Anchors' Fights Go Live. The Wall Street Journal. Published August 28, 2008. Retrieved August 28, 2008.
During the 2008 Presidential election, MSNBC's coverage was anchored by Keith Olbermann, Chris Matthews and David Gregory. The three were widely viewed as the face of the channel's political coverage. During the first three months of the presidential campaign, MSNBC's ratings grew by 158 percent.[tpl]cite news|author=Font size Print E-mail Share 13 Comments |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/11/24/business/marketwatch/main4628803.shtml |title=At MSNBC, The 'M' Is For (Rachel) Maddow |publisher=CBS News |date=2008-11-24 |accessdate=2010-07-30[/tpl] However, during the election coverage, anchors Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews were criticized for expressing left-leaning viewpoints on the channel, and both of them were later removed from the position of anchor.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/business/media/08msnbc.html|title=MSNBC Takes Incendiary Hosts From Anchor Seat|last=Stelter|first=Brian|date=September 7, 2008|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=March 26, 2010[/tpl] Audience viewership during the 2008 Presidential election more than doubled from the 2004 Presidential election, and the channel topped CNN in ratings for the first time during the last three months of the campaign in the key 25-54 age demographic.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/arts/television/15netw.html | work=The New York Times | title=Election's Over, So What's Next for the Cable News Channels? | first=Bill | last=Carter | date=November 15, 2008 | accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/business/media/08msnbc.html?pagewanted=1&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink | work=The New York Times | title=MSNBC Takes Incendiary Hosts From Anchor Seat | first=Brian | last=Stelter | date=September 8, 2008 | accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl]
In September 2008, the channel hired political analyst and Air America Radio personality Rachel Maddow to host a new political opinion program called The Rachel Maddow Show. The move to create a new program for the channel was widely seen as a smart ratings move, where beforehand, MSNBC lagged behind in coveted primetime ratings.At MSNBC, The 'M' Is For (Rachel) Maddow MarketWatch Columnist Jon Friedman Says Network's New Star Is Opinionated, But Restrained CBS News'.'

On October 11, 2010, MSNBC unveiled a new televised advertising campaign and slogan called "Lean Forward". "We've taken on CNN and we beat them," MSNBC president Phil Griffin told employees at a series of celebratory "town hall" meetings. "Now it's time to take on Fox." Concerning the campaign, Griffin said, "It is active, it is positive, it is about making tomorrow better than today, a discussion about politics and the actions and passions of our time."Phil Griffin: 'Lean Forward' Campaign 'Is Going to Define Us As MSNBC' Media Bistro Retrieved 2010-10-13 The new campaign embraces the network's politically progressive identity.Msnbc to ‘lean forward’ in two-year brand campaign MSNBC Retrieved 2010-10-13 The two-year advertising campaign would cost $2 million and consist of internet, television, and print advertising.

==Carriage issues==

Prior to 2010, MSNBC was not available to Verizon FiOS and AT&T U-verse television subscribers in portions of New York, northern New Jersey, and Connecticut that overlapped Cablevision's service area. One of several reasons for this lack of availability was an exclusive carriage agreement between MSNBC and Cablevision which prohibited competing wired providers from carrying MSNBC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://insidecable.blogsome.com/2007/02/22/cablevision-has-exclusive-fios-deal-with-msnbc-in-nyc// |title=Inside Cable News :: Cablevision has exclusive carriage deal with MSNBC... :: February :: 2007 |publisher=Insidecable.blogsome.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11[/tpl] The terms of the agreement were not publicly known.
In 2009, Verizon petitioned the FCC with a formal "program-access complaint" to terminate the deal. Connecticut attorney general Richard Blumenthal also argued that the arrangement could be illegal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/content/cablevision-hit-exclusives%e2%80%99 |title=Cablevision Hit On 'Exclusives’ - 2009-07-11 06:00:00 | Multichannel News |publisher=Multichannel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30[/tpl] After reaching a new contract, FiOS added the channel in New York City and in New Jersey on February 2, 2010.FiOS TV Finally Gets MSNBC In NY DMA - Cablevision Loses Exclusive Terrestrial Distribution Rights To News Channel Multichannel News January 28, 2010

==High definition==

The 1080i high-definition (HD) simulcast of MSNBC launched on June 29, 2009. The standard-definition (SD) feed of the network began to carry the full 16:9 screen downgraded from the HD feed in letterboxed mode in May 2013. Prior to then, the feed was center-cut to fill the 4:3 picture. While the SD feed is letterboxed, most graphical elements (including logos, the live bug and lower thirds) remain in the 4:3 safe area. MSNBC was the last major cable news network to adopt this practice, as Fox News Channel began letterboxing its standard-definition feed in September 2009, with CNN following suit on January 10, 2011.

==Graphics==

Between 2006 and 2009, MSNBC used a graphics package with an angular motif.
On June 29, 2009, MSNBC officially launched a new graphic scheme co-created by Adam Gault Studios and Carlo Vega, whereby a newly redesigned MSNBC logo, current program title, time, stock market index numbers and (when necessary) "live" bug were moved to the top of the screen, leaving the lower thirds to be used by the news ticker, story title and short summary, the last of which is replaced frequently by the name of the guest or correspondent currently being shown.
For a short time in 2009 from the debut, daytime programs shown on MSNBC HD included a widget on the right side of the screen which served as a secondary news ticker displaying the weather and news headlines as well as a blue bar which showed more stocks and business news graphics, but both features were eventually dropped in favor of full video encompassing both sides of the screen; the widget reflected a similar widget which appears on CNBC HD for the display of a stocks graph chart (and which has been retained to the present day). The news ticker only appears during news bulletins and rolling-news broadcasts, and is removed from the screen during opinion shows and documentaries. Some programs, such as The Ed Show, and Now with Alex Wagner remove the ticker in favor of a "tweet ticker", showing comments being made about the subject at hand by users of the social networking site, Twitter.

==International broadcasts==

MSNBC is shown only in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Kenya, parts of Latin America, and parts of Northern Africa (see below).

===MSNBC Canada===

In 2001, a Canadian version with some local content, MSNBC Canada, was developed; the channel launched on September 7, 2001. However, it was soon discontinued in 2004, and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission authorized the American version to be carried on Canadian cable and satellite providers. The channel was operated by Rogers Communications and co-owned by Rogers, Shaw and MSNBC, with each party owning a 33.33% voting interest in the service.
Programming included MSNBC programs as well as repeats of shows from the CBC and Cable Public Affairs Channel, as its way to fulfil its Canadian content requirements. The channel also ran infomercials, which the American service never shows.

===MSNBC Africa===

In Southern Africa, MSNBC is distributed free-to-air on satellite on Free2View TV as MSNBC Africa, a joint venture between Great Media Limited and MSNBC. Free2View airs MSNBC's programming from 4 p.m. to midnight ET in a block that repeats twice (live for the first airing), with local Weather Channel forecasts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://insidecable.blogsome.com/2007/11/17/southern-africa-to-get-msnbc/|title=Southern Africa to Get MSNBC|date=2007-11-17|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl] Botswana's national television broadcaster, BTV, also provides an un-edited broadcast of MSNBC (including advertisements) after their scheduled programming each evening. BTV is available within Botswana, as well as to Southern Africa viewers on DStv. TopTV, a satellite TV service in South Africa, also provides an unedited broadcast of MSNBC (including advertisements), which runs 24 hours a day. It is also available in Kenya through the cable service Zuku.

===Europe and Asia===

In Asia and Europe, MSNBC is not shown on a dedicated channel. When MSNBC started in 1996, they announced plans to start broadcasting in Europe during 1997. This never happened; however, MSNBC programming is shown for a few hours a day on the 24-hour news network OSN News in Europe and the Middle East. OSN News is a network of three 24-hour satellite and cable channels offering exclusively American news programming from ABC, NBC, PBS and MSNBC to U.S. expatriates and other viewers abroad, primarily geared towards an audience in the Arab countries.

===NTV-MSNBC===

In Turkey, NTV-MSNBC is the news channel of the Turkish broadcaster NTV Turkey. The channel is a joint partnership between the two, although very little Turkish content makes its way onto English MSNBC. English content on MSNBC is translated to Turkish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com|title=NTVMSNBC.com|year=2008|accessdate=2008-01-23[/tpl]

==Online==

Launched concurrently with MSNBC was its website, MSNBC.com; unlike the network itself, MSNBC.com was operated as the general online news outlet of NBC News as a part of Microsoft's MSN.com portal. The network and website also remained editorially separate; it did not adopt the network's increasingly liberal viewpoints (which itself was a cause for concern from NBC News staff, due to concerns that readers would think otherwise), and remained a joint venture with Microsoft even after it sold its stake in the MSNBC channel.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/media/07msnbc.html | publisher=The New York Times | first=Brian | last=Stelter | title=MSNBC on the Web May Change Its Name | date=October 6, 2010[/tpl]
In July 2012, NBC acquired Microsoft's remaining stake in MSNBC.com, and re-branded it as NBCNews.com.

==Criticism and controversy==

===Assertions of liberal bias===

Commentators have described MSNBC as having a bias towards left-leaning politics and the Democratic Party. In November 2007, a New York Times article stated that MSNBC's prime-time lineup is tilting more to the left. Washington Post media analyst Howard Kurtz has stated that the channel's evening lineup "has clearly gravitated to the left in recent years and often seems to regard itself as the antithesis of Fox News" (in reference to a number of journalists and political pundits considering Fox News to have a conservative bias in some programs). In 2011, Salon.com noted that "MSNBC’s prime-time lineup is now awash in progressive politics."Kornacki, Steve (2011-01-21) Is Olbermann the victim of his own success?, Salon.com That same year, Politico referred to MSNBC as "left-leaning."Barr, Andy (2011-04-05) MSNBC host coaxes Ron Paul to run, Politico In reference to changes in the channel's evening programming, senior vice president of NBC News Phil Griffin has said that "it happened naturally. There isn't a dogma we're putting through. There is a 'Go for it.'"
In the February 2008 issue of Men's Journal magazine, a MSNBC interviewee quoted a senior executive who said that liberal commentator Keith Olbermann "runs MSNBC" and that "because of his success, he's in charge" of the channel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/olbermann-talks-office-politics-other-politics_b17699|publisher=mediabistro.com:|title=Olbermann Talks Office Politics, Other Politics|date=January 10, 2008|accessdate=2009-09-16[/tpl] In 2007, The New York Times called Olbermann MSNBC's "most recognizable face". In September 2008, MSNBC stated that they were removing both Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews as live political event anchors, and replacing them with David Gregory, due to growing criticism that they were "too opinionated to be seen as neutral in the heat of the presidential campaign." Olbermann continued to broadcast Countdown both before and after the presidential and vice presidential debates, and both Matthews and Olbermann joined Gregory on the channel's election night coverage.
On November 13, 2009, in the days leading up to the release of 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's book Going Rogue, MSNBC's Dylan Ratigan used photoshopped pictures of Palin on the channel's Morning Meeting program. Ratigan apologized a few days later.[tpl]cite web|author=1:40 pm November 16, 2009, by Jay |url=http://blogs.ajc.com/jay-bookman-blog/2009/11/16/msnbc-apologizes-for-showing-fake-palin-photos/?cxntfid=blogs_jay_bookman_blog |title=MSNBC apologizes for showing fake Palin photos | Jay Bookman |publisher=Blogs.ajc.com |date=2009-11-16 |accessdate=2010-07-30[/tpl]
In October 2010, MSNBC began using the tagline "Lean Forward", which was described by some media outlets, including msnbc.com, as the network embracing its politically progressive identity.[tpl]cite web| last =| first =| title =MSNBC's new slogan: What does it even mean? | publisher =The Week| date =2010-10-06| url =http://theweek.com/article/index/207856/msnbcs-new-slogan-what-does-it-even-mean| accessdate =2010-10-11 [/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last =Stelter| first =Brian| title =With Tagline, MSNBC Embraces a Political Identity| publisher =The New York Times| date =2010-10-04| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/business/media/05adco.html| accessdate =2010-10-11 [/tpl][tpl]cite web| last =Miller| first =Emily| title =NBC Flees from Lefty MSNBC Cable Network | publisher =Human Events| date =2010-10-08| url =http://www.humanevents.com/2010/10/08/nbc-flees-from-lefty-msnbc-cable-network/| accessdate =2010-10-11 [/tpl]
In January 2012, MSNBC used Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthews and other network commentators during coverage of the 2012 Iowa Republican caucuses, a move seen by Nando Di Fino of the Mediaite website as "giving up on the straight news coverage, and instead appearing to be aiming to create some controversy."[tpl]cite web|last=Di Fino|first=Nando|title=MSNBC Hosting Lineup For Iowa Caucus Exchanges Neutral Journalism For Partisanship… And Fun|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/msnbc-hosting-lineup-for-iowa-caucus-exchanges-neutral-journalism-for-partisanship-and-fun/|publisher=Mediaite|accessdate=29 December 2011[/tpl]
In November 2012, MSNBC was called "The Anti-Fox" by The New York Times in a feature article that quoted former President Bill Clinton as saying, “Boy, it really has become our liberal version of Fox.”"[tpl]cite news|last=Stelter|first=Brian|title=The Anti-Fox Gains Ground|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/12/business/media/msnbc-its-ratings-rising-gains-ground-on-fox-news.html?pagewanted=1|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2 October 2013|date=November 11, 2012[/tpl] The article, citing data by the Nielsen TV ratings service, noted that while Fox News pulled in a larger overall viewership than MSNBC, the two networks drew nearly even (~300,000 vs. ~200,000) among the 25-54 age bracket most attractive to advertisers. In addition, MSNBC's most hard-core viewers spend nearly as much time watching the network (139 hours a week) as do Fox's most hard-core viewers (145 hours a week).
In the Pew Research Center's 2013 "State of the News Media" report, MSNBC was found to be the most opinionated news network, with 85% of the content being commentary or opinions, and only 15% of the content being factual reporting. The report also stated that MSNBC spends the least amount of money producing its news, only $240 million in 2012, compared to CNN, which spent $682 million, and Fox, which spent $820 million.[tpl]cite news| last =Bercovici| first =Jeff| title =Pew Study Finds MSNBC the Most Opinionated Cable News Channel By Far | publisher =Forbes| date =2013-03-18| url =http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/03/18/pew-study-finds-msnbc-the-most-opinionated-cable-news-channel-by-far/| accessdate =2013-07-17 [/tpl]

===Pro-Obama bias===

Some Democratic Party supporters, most notably former Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell and Clinton advisor Lanny Davis,[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081108043507/http://thehill.com/in-the-know/clinton-confidant-dismisses-msnbc-as-no-longer-fair-and-balanced-2008-05-05.html|title=Clinton confidant dismisses MSNBC as no longer fair and balanced|publisher=The Hill|date=2008-05-05|accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl] criticized MSNBC during and after the 2008 Democratic primaries, as covering Barack Obama more favorably than Hillary Clinton.

A study done by the Project for Excellence in Journalism showed that MSNBC had less negative coverage of Obama (14% of stories vs. 29% in the press overall) and more negative stories about Republican presidential candidate John McCain (73% of its coverage vs. 57% in the press overall).[tpl]cite web|author=October 29, 2008 |url=http://www.journalism.org/node/13436 |title=The Color of News | Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ) |publisher=Journalism.org |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2010-07-30[/tpl] MSNBC's on-air slogan during the week of the 2008 presidential election, "The Power of Change", was criticized as being overtly similar to Obama's campaign slogan of "Hope and Change".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10msnbc.html |title=MSNBC's Tag for Now: 'The Power of Change' |last=Stelter |first= Brian |work=The New York Times |date=2008-11-10 |accessdate=2008-11-13 [/tpl] Following the 2008 presidential election, conservative talk show host John Ziegler worked on a documentary titled Media Malpractice.... How Obama Got Elected, which was very critical of the media, especially MSNBC's role, in the 2008 presidential election. While promoting the documentary, he engaged in an on-air dispute with MSNBC news anchor Contessa Brewer, on how the media, especially MSNBC, had portrayed Sarah Palin.[tpl]cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/06/10/contessa-brewer-vs-john-ziegler-cut-the-mic/ |title=Contessa Brewer vs. John Ziegler re: Sarah Palin -- 'Cut the mic, please' |author=Annie Barrett |date=June 10, 2009 |work=PopWatch Blog |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=November 1, 2009 [/tpl]
During MSNBC's coverage of the Potomac primary, MSNBC's Chris Matthews said, "I have to tell you, you know, it's part of reporting this case, this election, the feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama's speech. My, I felt this thrill going up my leg. I mean, I don't have that too often.” This led Fox News to assert that both he and MSNBC were biased toward Obama.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,483568,00.html |title=Bernie Goldberg on 'Love Affair' Between Obama and Media – Hannity |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2010-02-23[/tpl]

Phil Donahue's 2002 program Donahue was canceled in late February 2003 during the buildup to the Iraq War. Despite earlier claims of cancellation because of low ratings,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/02/25/entertainment/main542005.shtml |title=Phil Donahue Gets The Ax, MSNBC Cancels Donahue's Talk Show Due To Low Ratings |publisher=CBS News |date=February 25, 2003[/tpl] Donahue was MSNBC's highest rated show that month.
A leaked NBC internal study revealed that the studio was concerned that Donahue would act as "a home for the liberal antiwar agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity."

==="Rise of the New Right" documentary===

In June 2010, a documentary airing on MSNBC and hosted by Chris Matthews called Rise of the New Right drew significant criticism from some conservatives and the Tea Party movement. The documentary features interviews with Dick Armey, the former House Majority Leader, Orly Taitz, a leading figure in the "birther" movement, and radio host Alex Jones. The documentary also showed the Michigan Militia's survival training camp and hit the campaign trail with Kentucky Senatorial candidate Rand Paul.[tpl]cite news| last =Weigel| first =David| title =MSNBC documentary on the 'New Right' profiles birthers, militias, Alex Jones| publisher =The Washington Post| date =2010-06-07| url =http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/06/upcoming_msnbc_documentary_on.html| accessdate =2010-06-20 [/tpl]
After the documentary aired, FreedomWorks, which is chaired by Armey, issued a letter calling for a boycott of Dawn and Procter & Gamble, which advertise during Hardball with Chris Matthews.[tpl]cite news| last =Weigel| first =David| title =Tea partyers push back against 'The Rise of the New Right' with boycott| publisher =The Washington Post| date =2010-06-17| url =http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/06/tea_partyers_push_back_against.html| accessdate =2010-06-20 [/tpl][tpl]cite news| last =Montopoli| first =Brian| title =Tea Party Groups Lash Out at MSNBC Over Special| publisher =CBS News| date =2010-06-17| url =http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20008106-503544.html| accessdate =2010-06-20 [/tpl] The boycott was ineffective; Procter & Gamble continued to advertise with the show.

===Negative Romney coverage in 2012 presidential election===

A study by the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism found that MSNBC's coverage of Mitt Romney during the final week of the 2012 presidential campaign (68% negative with no positive stories in the sample), was far more negative than the overall press, and even more negative than it had been during October 1 to 28, when 5% was positive and 57% was negative.[tpl]cite press release | title = THE FINAL DAYS OF THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN 2012: Final Weeks in the Mainstream Press | publisher = Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism | date = November 19, 2012 | url = http://www.journalism.org/analysis_report/final_weeks_mainstream_press | accessdate = November 20, 2012[/tpl] On the other hand, their coverage of Barack Obama improved in the final week before the presidential election. From October 1 to 28, 33% of stories were positive and 13% negative. During the campaign's final week, 51% of MSNBC's stories were positive while there were no negative stories at all about Obama in the sample.

===Suspensions of hosts===

====Michael Savage====

During the spring and early summer of 2003, MSNBC featured a weekend talk show hosted by conservative radio host Michael Savage. In July of that year, Savage responded to a prank caller on his show by calling him a "pig" and a "sodomite", and telling him he "should get AIDS and die." Savage's show was canceled and Savage was fired from the channel shortly afterward (with some reports placing the termination immediately after the episode in question ended).[tpl]cite news|last=Lowry|first= Brian|title=Savage gets the boot after on-air anti-gay outburst|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=July 8, 2003|page=E1[/tpl]

====Don Imus====

In early April 2007, Don Imus, whose radio show Imus in the Morning was simulcast on MSNBC for over ten years, described members of the Rutgers University women's basketball team as "some nappy-headed hoes." The comments sparked outrage, as many considered them to be racist and sexist. After sponsors began to withdraw advertisements from the show, MSNBC canceled the simulcast. Imus, as well as NBC News, apologized to the Rutgers Basketball team for the remarks.MSNBC drops simulcast of Don Imus show. msnbc.com. 11 April 2007. The television simulcast of Don Imus' program later moved to RFD-TV and now airs on the Fox Business Network.

Two weeks later, Griffin announced the suspension of Joe Scarborough for the same offense, as the Morning Joe host had donated $4,000 to Republican candidates in Florida. Like Olbermann's suspension, Scarborough's suspension was brief, and he returned to the airwaves on November 24."MSNBC Suspends ‘Morning Joe’ Host Scarborough for Political Donations" Wall Street Journal November 19, 2010 On January 21, 2011, MSNBC announced that Olbermann would host his final show that same night.

====Martin Bashir====

Host Martin Bashir resigned after making a controversial comment about Sarah Palin.http://www.mediaite.com/tv/martin-bashir-resigns-from-msnbc/ On November 15, 2013, Bashir criticized Sarah Palin for comments that she made comparing the Federal debt to slavery."MSNBC not commenting on whether further action contemplated against Bashir", Associated Press via Washington Post (November 19, 2013). Bashir attempted to counter Palin's comparison by referencing the cruel and barbaric punishment of slaves described by slave overseer Thomas Thistlewood, specifically a punishment called "Derby's dose" which involved forcing slaves to defecate or urinate into the mouth of another slave as punishment. Bashir then concluded by saying "When Mrs. Palin invokes slavery, she doesn’t just prove her rank ignorance. She confirms if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from Thomas Thistlewood, she would be the outstanding candidate."Williams, Rob. "Martin Bashir says Sarah Palin is an 'idiot' and suggests someone should defecate in her mouth", The Independent (November 18, 2013).http://www.bustle.com/articles/10104-msnbcs-martin-bashir-resigns-over-sarah-palin-slavery-comments
