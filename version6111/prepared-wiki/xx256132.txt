==Inception==

Alcopop! Records was formally created after a small loan was gambled on the Charlton vs Portsmouth match of 16 September 1996, with money for the first release and show generated from a successful bet on the match. This money was invested in a band from Yeovil called Encyclopedia,http://www.alterthepress.com/2011/01/interview-jack-clothier-alcopop-records.html with the first single 'Emily' (Alcopop001) kicking off the 1996/7 singles club (which also included the likes of Midget, data.select.party and 4 or 5 Magicians). Founder Jack pOp, in a recent interview with the Complete Music Update website, said "Alcopop! was born back in 2006 with a three figure loan from my Dad and a fuzzy idea to mix up some classic 90s indie and some awesome new stuff and – via a series of handmade, special three-inch CDs – do our bit to prove that physical music wasn’t dead. We got drunk, bet a large chunk of the money on a football match, and Congolese striker Lomana Lua Lua ensured that we had enough cash to get going!" http://www.thecmuwebsite.com/article/qa-jack-clothier-alcopop-records/

==Alcopop! Special Formats==

As well as operating more standard album and EP releases on CD and vinyl, Alcopop!

When asked about motivation for producing these different formats in a recent interview, Jack pOp stated "For me the it’s more than what is on that record… It’s about the experience from the moment you get it, how the artwork makes you feel, being able to show it to friends – the anticipation of dropping the needle/ pressing the play button… I genuinely love it." http://justdip.co.uk/2013/07/04/dip-versus-alcopop-records/
