CATEGORIES: Lutheran organizations

Lutheran Services in America (LSA) is a not-for-profit corporation that coordinates the work of nearly 300 independent Lutheran health and human service organizations affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, and other health and human service organizations. It is headquartered in Baltimore.  In terms of revenue, it is the single largest charitable organization in Americahttp://www.mint.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/CharityWhoCares-3.jpg.
These organizations provided health and human services to over 6 million people in 2006 throughout the United States and the Caribbean.  Building upon the strengths of people and communities, Lutheran social ministry organizations address a wide range of needs, including those of the elderly, children and families, people with special needs, prisoners, people with disabilities, and provide disaster response in communities.
Although Lutheran Services in America was established in 1997, LSA continues the one-and-one-half century practice of organized Lutheran efforts to serve those in need.  Many of these social ministry organizations were established in the mid-19th century as hospitals or orphanages.  New organizations continue to be developed as contemporary needs are identified.  More than a quarter-million volunteers and staff members treat acute and chronic illnesses of body and mind, provide care for the whole person in need, and strengthen and empower individuals and families to care for themselves, for one another, and for their communities.  Services are open to all people regardless of religious affiliation.  Indeed, the vast majority of people who receive care from Lutheran service organizations are not Lutheran.
