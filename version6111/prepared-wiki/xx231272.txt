Draper House is a historic home located at Milford, Sussex County, Delaware.  It was built in 1870, and is a two-story, five bay, center hall, frame dwelling originally built in the Victorian Gothic style.  It was remodeled in the early-20th century with elements of Queen Anne and Classical Revival building traditions.  It has a hipped roof with dormers, a telescoping turret, a truncated tower, a second floor projecting bay with a Palladian window, and a full three-sided porch with a shadow curve supported by Ionic order columns. From 1948 to 1953, it was owned by the Milford Hospital and used by them as housing for nurses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/82002365.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Draper House |author=unknown|date=undated[/tpl] and Accompanying photo
