Beriberi refers to a cluster of symptoms caused primarily by a nutritional deficit in Vitamin B1 (thiamine). Beriberi has conventionally been divided into three separate entities, relating to the body system mainly involved (peripheral nervous system or cardiovascular) or age of patient (infantile). Beriberi is one of several thiamine-deficiency related conditions, which may occur concurrently, including Wernicke's encephalopathy (when mainly affects the central nervous system), Korsakoff's syndrome (when it reaches psychiatric aspects), and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (with both neurologic and psychiatric symptoms).
Historically, Beriberi has been endemic in regions dependent on what is variously referred to as polished, white, or de-husked rice. This type of rice has its husk removed in order to extend its lifespan, but also has the unintended side-effect of removing the primary source of thiamine.[tpl]citation | url = http://www.medical-library.net/content/view/826/41/ | title = Doctors' Medical Library – Beriberi (Thiamine Deficiency) (B1 Deficiency) | first = Ron | last = Kennedy| year = 2013[/tpl]

==Pathophysiology==

Thiamine has a half-life of 18 days and is quickly exhausted, particularly when metabolic demands exceed intake. Thiamine is involved in a variety of glucose metabolism-related and neurological functions. After modification in the body to a diphosphate form, thiamine is involved in a vast array of functions:
Neurons are very sensitive to ionic and metabolic changes produced in their immediate environment, which initially affect metabolism, electrical activity and performance, but then can lead to cell death. [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms of beriberi include weight loss, emotional disturbances, impaired sensory perception, weakness and pain in the limbs, and periods of irregular heart rate. Edema (swelling of bodily tissues) is common. It may increase the amount of lactic acid and pyruvic acid within the blood. In advanced cases, the disease may cause high output cardiac failure and death. Symptoms may occur concurrently with those of Wernicke's encephalopathy, a primarily neurological thiamine-deficiency related condition.
Beriberi is divided into three historical classifications:

===Dry beriberi===

Dry beriberi causes wasting and partial paralysis resulting from damaged peripheral nerves.  It is also referred to as endemic neuritis. It is characterized by:
A selective impairment of the large proprioceptive sensory fibers without motor impairment can occur and present as a prominent sensory ataxia, which is a loss of balance and coordination due to loss of the proprioceptive inputs from the periphery and loss of position sense.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1038/nrneurol.2010.16 |title=Subacute sensory ataxia and optic neuropathy with thiamine deficiency|year=2010 |last1=Spinazzi |first1=Marco |last2=Angelini |first2=Corrado |last3=Patrini |first3=Cesare|journal=Nature Reviews Neurology |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=288–93 |pmid=20308997[/tpl]

===Wet beriberi===

Wet beriberi affects the heart and circulatory system. It is sometimes fatal, as it causes a combination of heart failure and weakening of the capillary walls, which causes the peripheral tissues to become edematous. Wet beriberi is characterized by:

===Infantile beriberi===

Infantile beriberi usually occurs between two and six months of age in children whose mothers have inadequate thiamine intake. In the acute form, the baby develops dyspnea and cyanosis and soon dies of heart failure. The following symptoms may be described in infantile beriberi:

==Epidemiology==

===Inadequate nutrition===

Beriberi caused by inadequate nutritional intake is rare today in developed countries[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] because of quality of food and the fact that many foods are fortified with vitamins.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] There are no reliable statistics for beriberi in developed countries in the 19th century or earlier; neither are statistics available before the last century in countries in extreme poverty.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Beriberi is a recurrent nutritional disease in detention houses even in this century. High rates of illness and death in overcrowded Haitian jails was traced in 2007 to the traditional practice of washing rice before cooking.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2007/01/haiti-mysterious-prison-ailment-traced-to-us-rice/ |title=Haiti: Mysterious Prison Ailment Traced to U.S. Rice |first1=Jeb |last1=Sprague |authorlink1=Jeb Sprague |first2=Eunida |last2=Alexandra |agency=Inter Press Service |date=17 January 2007[/tpl] In the Ivory Coast, among a group of prisoners with heavy punishment, 64% were affected by beriberi. Before beginning treatment, prisoners exhibited symptoms of dry or wet beriberi with neurological signs (swarming[tpl]specify|date=March 2014[/tpl]: 41%), cardiovascular signs (dyspnoea: 42%, thoracic pain: 35%), and oedemas of the lower limbs (51%). The rate of healing was about 97%.Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 2011 Dec;104(5):347-51. doi: 10.1007/s13149-011-0136-6. Epub 2011 Feb 18.
Populations under extreme stress may be at higher risk for beriberi. 
Displaced populations, such as war refugees, are susceptible to micronutritional deficiency, including beriberi.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1079/PNS2002151 |title=Meeting the challenges of micronutrient deficiencies in emergency-affected populations |year=2009 |last1=Prinzo |first1=Z.

===Wernicke's encephalopathy===

Beriberi may also be caused by shortcomings other than inadequate intake: diseases or operations on the digestive tract, alcoholism, dialysis, genetic deficiencies, etc. All these causes mainly affecting the central nervous system, and provoking the development of what is known as Wernicke's disease or Wernicke's encephalopathy.
Wernicke´s disease is one of the most prevalent neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases.[tpl]citation | url = http://enfermedad-de-wernicke.weebly.com/  | title = Enfermedad de Wernicke (o Encefalopatía de Wernicke).

In children, only 58% were diagnosed. In alcohol abusers, autopsy series showed neurological damages at rates of 12,5% or more. Mortality caused by Wernicke's disease reaches 17% of diseases, which means 3.4/1000 or about 25 million contemporaries.[tpl]cite journal | last = Harper |first = CG | last2 = Giles |first2 = M |last3 = Finlay-Jones | first3= R | pmid = 3701343  | journal = J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry | date = April 1986 | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 341–5 | title = Clinical signs in the Wernicke-Korsakoff complex: a retrospective analysis of 131 cases diagnosed at necropsy | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3701343 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.49.4.341 | pmc=1028756[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last = Harper |first = C | pmid = 438830 | journal = J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry | date = March 1979 | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 226–31 | title = Wernicke's encephalopathy: a more common disease than realised.

In addition, uncounted numbers of persons can experience fetal damage and subsequent diseases.

==History==

===Etymology===

The origin of the term 'beriber' comes from a Sinhalese phrase meaning "weak, weak" or "I cannot, I cannot", the word being duplicated for emphasis.Oxford English Dictionary: "Beri-beri... a Cingalese word, f. beri weakness, the reduplication being intensive ...", page 203, 1937A Sinhalese-English Dictionary, Rev. Charles Carter: "බැරි බැරි.රෝගය, a. the diseaseberi beri, a form of neuritis accompanied by dropsy &c..." , page 448, 1924Beriberi, Information about Beriberi[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=beriberi | title = Beriberi | publisher = Online Etymology Dictionary | accessdate = 8 July 2013[/tpl]
In 1630, a Dutch physician named Jacobus Bontius (Jacob de Bondt; 1591–1631) encountered the disease while working in Java. In the first known description of beriberi, he wrote: "A certain very troublesome affliction, which attacks men, is called by the inhabitants beriberi (which means sheep). I believe those, whom this same disease attacks, with their knees shaking and the legs raised up, walk like sheep. It is a kind of paralysis, or rather tremor: for it penetrates the motion and sensation of the hands and feet indeed sometimes of the whole body."[tpl]cite book|first1=Jeremy M |last1=Berg |authorlink1=Jeremy M.

===Identification===

In the late 1800s, beriberi was studied by Takaki Kanehiro, a British-trained Japanese medical doctor of the Japanese Navy.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Yoshinori |last1=Itokawa |year=1976 |title=Kanehiro Takaki (1849–1920): A Biographical Sketch |journal=Journal of Nutrition |pmid=772183 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=772183 |volume=106 |issue=5 |pages=581–8[/tpl] Beriberi was a serious problem in the Japanese navy: sailors fell ill an average of four times a year in the period 1878 to 1881, and 35% were cases of beriberi. In 1883, Kanehiro learned of a very high incidence of beriberi among cadets on a training mission from Japan to Hawaii, via New Zealand and South America. The voyage lasted more than 9 months and resulted in 169 cases of sickness and 25 deaths on a ship of 376 men. With the support of the Japanese Navy, he conducted an experiment in which another ship was deployed on the same route, except that its crew was fed a diet of meat, fish, barley, rice, and beans. At the end of the voyage, this crew had suffered only 14 cases of beriberi and no deaths. This convinced Kanehiro and the Japanese Navy that diet was the cause. In 1884, Kanehiro observed that beriberi was endemic among low-ranking crew who often were provided nothing but rice, but not among crews of Western navies and nor among Japanese officers who consumed a more varied diet.
In 1897, Dr. Christiaan Eijkman, a Dutch physician and pathologist, demonstrated that beriberi is caused by poor diet, and discovered that feeding unpolished rice (instead of the polished variety) to chickens helped to prevent beriberi. The following year, Sir Frederick Hopkins postulated that some foods contained "accessory factors" – in addition to proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and salt – that were necessary for the functions of the human body.[tpl]cite web | first = Jack | last = Challem | year = 1997 | url = http://www.thenutritionreporter.com/history_of_vitamins.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100608223713/http://www.thenutritionreporter.com/history_of_vitamins.html | archivedate = 8 June 2010 | title = The Past, Present and Future of Vitamins[/tpl][tpl]MEDRS|date=July 2012[/tpl][tpl]citation | url = http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/medicine/vitamin_b1/eijkman.html | title = Christiaan Eijkman, Beriberi and Vitamin B1 | publisher = Nobelprize.org, Nobel Media AB | accessdate = 8 July 2013[/tpl] In 1901, Gerrit Grijns (May 28, 1865 – November 11, 1944), a Dutch physician and assistant to Christiaan Eijkman in the Netherlands, correctly interpreted the disease as a deficiency syndrome,[tpl]cite journal |last1=Grijns |first1=G. |year=1901 |title=Over polyneuritis gallinarum |journal=Geneeskundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indie |volume=43 |pages=3–110[/tpl] and between 1910 and 1913, Dr. Edward Bright Vedder established that an extract of rice bran is a treatment for beriberi.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] Nonethless, as late as 1911, the Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition described it as ""believed...to be caused by an infective agent of a parasitic nature".[tpl]Cite EB1911|title=Beri-beri |volume=3 |pages=774-775 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabrit03chisrich#page/774/mode/2up[/tpl] In 1929, Eijkman and Hopkins were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries.

==Treatment==

Many patients of beriberi can be treated with thiamine alone,http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/116930-treatment but many causes necessarily lead to multiple deficiencies of vitamins and minerals such as hyperemesis gravidarum or gastric bypass.
Initially, is managed intravenously with thiamine (latter orally). This supplementation should be earlier than glucose supply that would cause the worsening of the disease. Supplementation can be monitored using blood tests. Rapid and dramatic  recovery can occur within hours of administration. In situations where concentrated thiamine supplements are unavailable, feeding the patient with a thiamine-rich diet (e.g. whole grain brown bread) will lead to recovery, though at a much slower rate.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
