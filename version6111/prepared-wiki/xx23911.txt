==Early life==

Deborah Jane Kerr-Trimmer was born in a private nursing home (hospital) in Glasgow,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/features/features/display.var.1771494.0.0.php |title=Deborah Kerr profile |accessdate=19 October 2007 |author=The Herald[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.helensburgh-heritage.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=730:deborah-kerr-and-helensburgh&catid=81:the-arts&Itemid=458 |title=Deborah Kerr and Helensburgh |accessdate=14 January 2011 |author=Donald Fullarton[/tpl] the only daughter of Kathleen Rose (née Smale) and Capt.

Kerr had a younger brother, Edmund ("Teddy"), who became a journalist. He was killed in a road rage incident in 2004.[tpl]cite news |title='Road rage' killer's appeal win |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/4861328.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=30 March 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Killer's term cut |url=http://archive.worcesternews.co.uk/2006/4/5/408116.html |publisher=Worcester News |date=5 April 2006[/tpl]
Kerr was educated at the independent Northumberland House School, Henleaze, Bristol (the school was demolished in 1937), and at Rossholme School, Weston-super-Mare. Kerr originally trained as a ballet dancer, first appearing on stage at Sadler's Wells in 1938. After changing careers, she soon found success as an actress. Her first acting teacher was her aunt, Phyllis Smale, who ran the Hicks-Smale Drama School in Bristol.[tpl]cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5212/is_2000/ai_n19128627 |title=Deborah Kerr profile |year=2000 |work=International Dictionary of Film and Filmmakers |publisher=FindArticles.com |first=Richard |last=Sater[/tpl] She adopted the name Deborah Kerr on becoming a film actress ("Kerr" was a family name going back to the maternal grandmother of her grandfather Arthur Kerr-Trimmer).Braun, Eric.

==Career==

===Theatre===

Kerr's first stage appearance was at Weston-super-Mare in 1937, as "Harlequin" in the mime play Harlequin and Columbine. She then went to the Sadler's Wells ballet school and in 1938 made her début in the corps de ballet in Prometheus. After various walk-on parts in Shakespeare productions at the Open-Air Theatre in Regent's Park, London, she joined the Oxford Playhouse repertory company in 1940, playing, inter alia, "Margaret" in Dear Brutus and "Patty Moss" in The Two Bouquets.
In 1943, aged 21, Kerr made her West End début as "Ellie Dunn" in a revival of Heartbreak House at the Cambridge Theatre, stealing attention from stalwarts such as Edith Evans and Isabel Jeans. "She has the rare gift", wrote critic Beverley Baxter, "of thinking her lines, not merely remembering them. The process of development from a romantic, silly girl to a hard, disillusioned woman in three hours was moving and convincing".
It was to be 29 years before Deborah Kerr returned to the London stage, and then in such unremarkable and occasional productions as an old-fashioned weepie, The Day After the Fair (Lyric, 1972), a Peter Ustinov comedy, Overheard (Haymarket, 1981) and a revival of Emlyn Williams's The Corn is Green. After her first London success in 1943, she toured England and Scotland in Heartbreak House. Near the end of the Second World War she also toured Holland, France and Belgium for Ensa as "Mrs Manningham" in Angel Street, and Britain (with Stewart Granger) in Gaslight.
Having established herself as a film actress in the meantime, she made her Broadway debut in 1953, appearing in Robert Anderson's Tea and Sympathy, for which she received a Tony Award nomination. Kerr repeated her role along with her stage partner John Kerr (no relation) in Vincente Minnelli's film adaptation of the drama. In 1955, Kerr won the Sarah Siddons Award for her performance in Chicago during a national tour of the play. After her Broadway début in 1953, she toured the United States with Tea and Sympathy. In 1975, she returned to Broadway, creating the role of Nancy in Edward Albee's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Seascape.
The theatre, despite her success in films, was always to remain Kerr's first love, even though going on stage filled her with trepidation:
[tpl]quote|I do it because it's exactly like dressing up for the grown ups. I don't mean to belittle acting but I'm like a child when I'm out there performing—shocking the grownups, enchanting them, making them laugh or cry. It's an unbelievable terror, a kind of masochistic madness. The older you get, the easier it should be but it isn't.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1566509/Deborah-Kerr.html |title=Deborah Kerr profile in |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 October 2007 |accessdate=20 October 2007 |location=London[/tpl][/tpl]

===Films===

Kerr's first film role was in the British film Contraband in 1940 but her scenes were left on the cutting room floor. With her next two British films[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Major Barbara and Love on the Dole (both 1941)[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]her screen future seemed assured and her performance, said James Agate of Love on the Dole, "is not within a mile of Wendy Hiller's in the theatre, but it is a charming piece of work by a very pretty and promising beginner, so pretty and so promising that there is the usual yapping about a new star". She went on to make Hatter's Castle (1942), in which she starred opposite Robert Newton and James Mason, and then played a Norwegian resistance fighter in The Day Will Dawn (1942). She was an immediate hit with the public: British exhibitors voted her the most popular local female star at the box office.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article44833626 |title=FILM NOTES. |newspaper=The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879 – 1954) |location=Perth, WA |date=7 December 1945 |accessdate=9 July 2012 |page=13 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
In 1943, she played three women in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp. During the filming, according to Powell's autobiography, she and Powell became lovers:[tpl]cite book |last=Powell |first=Michael |title=A Life in Movies |publisher=Heinemann |year=1986 |ISBN=0-434-59945-X[/tpl]  "I realised that Deborah was both the ideal and the flesh-and-blood woman whom I had been searching for". Kerr made clear that her surname should be pronounced the same as "car". To avoid confusion over pronunciation, Louis B. Mayer of MGM billed her as "Kerr rhymes with Star!"[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/movies/19kerr.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Deborah%20Kerr%20obituary&st=cse&oref=slogin |title=Deborah Kerr, Actress Known for Genteel Grace and a Sexy Beach Kiss, Dies at 86 |date=19 October 2007 |accessdate=20 October 2007 |author=New York Times |work=The New York Times[/tpl]
Although the British Army refused to co-operate with the producers[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]and Winston Churchill thought the film would ruin wartime morale[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Kerr's next film, Colonel Blimp, confounded critics when it proved to be an artistic and commercial success. Powell hoped to reunite Kerr and lead actor Roger Livesey in his next film, A Canterbury Tale (1944), but her agent had sold her contract to MGM. According to Powell, his affair with Kerr ended when she made it clear to him that she would accept an offer to go to Hollywood if one were made.
Her role as a troubled nun in Black Narcissus in 1947 brought her to the attention of Hollywood producers. The film was a hit in the US as well as the UK and Kerr won the New York Film Critics' Award as Actress of the Year. British exhibitors voted her the eighth most-popular local star at the box office.'Bing's Lucky Number: Pa Crosby Dons 4th B.O. Crown', The Washington Post (1923–1954) D.C 3 January 1948: 12. 
In Hollywood, Kerr's British accent and manner led to a succession of roles portraying refined, reserved and "proper" English ladies. Kerr nevertheless used any opportunity to discard her cool exterior. She starred in the 1950 adventure film King Solomon's Mines, shot on location in Africa with Stewart Granger and Richard Carlson. This was immediately followed by her appearance in the religious epic Quo Vadis? (1951), shot at Cinecittà in Rome, in which she played the indomitable "Lygia", a first-century Christian. She then played the very royal "Princess Flavia" in a remake of The Prisoner of Zenda (1952). In 1953, Kerr "showed her theatrical mettle" as "Portia" in Joseph Mankiewicz's Julius Caesar (1953). She then departed from typecasting with a performance that brought out her sensuality, as "Karen Holmes", the embittered military wife in Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity (1953), for which she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. The American Film Institute acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which she and Burt Lancaster romped illicitly and passionately amidst crashing waves on a Hawaii beach. The organisation ranked it twentieth in its list of the 100 most romantic films of all time.[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Thereafter, Kerr's career choices would make her known in Hollywood for her versatility as an actress."Deborah Kerr, versatile British actress, dies at 86." International Herald Tribune, 18 October 2007. Retrieved on 11 November 2007. She played the repressed wife in The End of the Affair (1955), with Van Johnson; a nun in Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957) opposite her long-time friend Robert Mitchum; a mama's girl in Separate Tables (1956) opposite David Niven; and a governess in both The Chalk Garden and The Innocents (1961). She also portrayed an earthy Australian sheep-herder's wife in The Sundowners and appeared as lustful and beautiful screen enchantresses in both Beloved Infidel and Bonjour Tristesse. She made two comedies: The Grass Is Greener and Marriage on the Rocks.
Among her most famous roles were Anna Leonowens in the film version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I (1956); and opposite Cary Grant in An Affair to Remember (1957). In 1966, the producers of Carry On Screaming! offered her a fee comparable to that paid to the rest of the cast combined, but she turned it down in favour of appearing in an aborted stage version of Flowers for Algernon. 
In 1967, Kerr starred in Casino Royale, achieving the distinction of being, at 46, the oldest "Bond Girl" in any James Bond film. In 1969, the pressure of competition from younger actresses made her agree to appear nude in John Frankenheimer's The Gypsy Moths, the only nude scene in her career. Concern about the parts being offered to her, as well as the increasing amount of nudity included in films, led her to abandon the medium at the end of the 1960s in favour of television and theatre work.

===Television===

Kerr experienced a career resurgence on television in the early 1980s when she played the role of the nurse[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]played by Elsa Lanchester in the 1957 movie[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]in Witness for the Prosecution. Later, Kerr rejoined screen partner Robert Mitchum in Reunion at Fairborough. She also took on the role of the older Emma Harte, a tycoon, in the adaptation of Barbara Taylor Bradford's A Woman of Substance. For this performance, Kerr was nominated for an Emmy Award. 

==Personal life==

Kerr's first marriage was to Royal Air Force Squadron Leader Anthony Bartley on 29 November 1945. They had two daughters, Melanie Jane (born 27 December 1947) and Francesca Ann (born 20 December 1951 and subsequently married to the actor John Shrapnel). The marriage was troubled, owing to Bartley's jealousy of his wife's fame and financial success and because her career often took her away from home. They divorced in 1959.
Her second marriage was to author Peter Viertel on 23 July 1960. In marrying Viertel, she became stepmother to Viertel's daughter, Christine Viertel. Although she long resided in Klosters, Switzerland and Marbella, Spain, she moved back to Britain to be closer to her own children as her health began to deteriorate. Her husband, however, continued to live in Marbella.[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl]
