Darling Harbour is a harbour adjacent to the city centre of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is also a large recreational and pedestrian precinct that is situated on western outskirts of the Sydney central business district. The locality extends northwards from Chinatown, along both sides of Cockle Bay to King Street Wharf on the east, and to the suburb of Pyrmont on the west. Cockle Bay is just one of the waterways that makes up Darling Harbour, which opens north into the much larger Port Jackson.
The precinct and its immediate surroundings are administered independently of the local government area of the City of Sydney, by a New South Wales state government statutory authority, the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority.

==History==

Darling Harbour is named after Lieutenant-General Ralph Darling, who was Governor of New South Wales from 1825 to 1831. It was originally part of the commercial port of Sydney, including the Darling Harbour Railway Goods Yard. During the Great Depression, the eastern part of Darling Harbour (Barangaroo) became known as The Hungry Mile, a reference to the waterside workers searching for jobs along the wharves.
Much of the land had been the site of the NSW Railways central marshalling yards and freight consolidation centre. The Enquiry into the NSW transport industry, including rail/road competition, (1978â€“80) under Commissioner Gavan McDonell,[tpl]cite web|url=http://opac.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/opacs/BasicSearch?status=2&pageno=1&phrasecode=0&fieldcode=4&searchwords=NSW%20(NEW%20SOUTH%20WALES)%20%20DEPT.%20OF%20TRANSPORT%20%20COMMISSION%20ON%20ENQUIRY%20INTO%20THE%20NSW%20ROAD%20FREIGHT%20INDUSTRY&collection=all |title=Commission of Enquiry into the NSW transport industry, 6 vols, Sydney 1980 |publisher=Opac.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl]  found that this centre was inefficient, should be moved, and the land used for other public purposes. These recommendations were acted upon and  by the mid-to-late 1980s, when the area had become largely derelict it was redeveloped as a pedestrian and tourist precinct as an initiative of then New South Wales Minister for Public Works, Laurie Brereton. The Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre at Darling Harbour was a venue of the 2000 Summer Olympic Games and a key meeting venue of APEC Australia 2007.
