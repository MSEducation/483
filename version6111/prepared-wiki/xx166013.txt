Lucas Tanner is an NBC television drama that aired during the 1974-75 season.  The title character, played by David Hartman, was a former baseball player and sportswriter who becomes an English teacher at the fictional Harry S Truman High School in Webster Groves, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis.  Episodes often deal with the resistance of traditional teachers to Tanner's unorthodox teaching style.
Regular co-stars included Rosemary Murphy, Kimberly Beck, and ten-year-old Robbie Rist. Unusually, the show was actually filmed in Webster Groves, rather than on a Hollywood backlot. That gave it a somewhat unusual "look" for a prime-time TV series.
A 90-minute pilot film of the series aired on NBC the week of May 4, 1974; the pilot also starred Kathleen Quinlan and Joe Garagiola.NBC TV Guide ad for week of May 4, 1974, at Vintage Toledo TV.
This series was Hartman's last television series as an actorâ€”in November 1975, he began a long-running stint as co-host of ABC's Good Morning America.
