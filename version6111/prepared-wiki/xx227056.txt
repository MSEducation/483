==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 5 stars stating "As good an introduction to his work as any, this program includes diverse works ranging from Leadbelly to Leonard Bernstein, plus Evans' own "Jambangle." The arranger's inventive use of the voices of his rather unique sidemen make this a memorable set.".Yanow, S.  Allmusic Review accessed July 4, 2011
