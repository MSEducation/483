Hakka cuisine, or Kuhchia cuisine, is the cooking style of the Hakka people, who originated in the southeastern Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, but may also be found in other parts of China and in countries with significant overseas Chinese communities.[tpl]cite book |last=Lau Anusasananan |first=Linda|title=The Hakka Cookbook: Chinese Soul Food from Around the World|year=2012 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |isbn=0520273281[/tpl] There are numerous restaurants in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore serving Hakka cuisine.

Hakka food also includes takes on other traditional Chinese dishes, just as other Chinese ethnic groups do. Some of the more notable dishes in Hakka cuisine are listed as follows:

==Hakka cuisine in India==

In India and other regions with significant Indian populations, the locally known "Hakka cuisine" is actually an Indian adaptation of original Hakka dishes. This variation of Hakka cuisine is in reality, mostly Indian Chinese cuisine. It is called "Hakka cuisine" because in India many owners of restaurants that serve this cuisine are of Hakka origin. Typical dishes include 'chilli chicken' and 'Dong bei chow mein' (an Indianised version of real Dongbei cuisine), and these restaurants also serve traditional Indian dishes such as pakora. Being very popular in these areas, this style of cuisine is often mistakenly credited of being representative of Hakka cuisine in general, whereas the authentic style of Hakka cuisine is rarely known in these regions.[tpl]-[/tpl]
