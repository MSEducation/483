As of 2010, there are 243 incorporated municipalities in the U.S. state of Utah. A municipality is called a town if the population is under 1,000 people, and a city if the population is over 1,000 people.[tpl]cite web | url=http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE10/htm/10_02_030100.htm | title=Utah Code, Title 10, Chapter 2, Section 301 | publisher=Utah State Legislature | accessdate=May 11, 2010[/tpl] Incorporation means that a municipal charter has been adopted by the affected population following a referendum. In the Constitution of Utah, cities and towns are granted "the authority to exercise all powers relating to municipal affairs, and to adopt and enforce within its limits, local police, sanitary and similar regulations not in conflict with the general law.".[tpl]cite web | url=http://le.utah.gov/~code/CONST/htm/00I11_000500.htm | title=Utah Constitution, Article XI, Section 5 | publisher=Utah State Legislature | accessdate=May 11, 2010[/tpl] They also have the power to raise and collect taxes, to provide and maintain local public services, acquire by eminent domain any property needed to make local improvements, and to raise money by bonds.
On July 22, 1847, the first party of Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, where they founded Salt Lake City, the first European settlement in Utah. Over the next 22 years, more than 70,000 pioneers crossed the plains and settled in Utah.[tpl]cite book | first1=William W. |last1=Slaughter | first2=Michael | last2=Landon | title=Trail of Hope â€“ The Story of the Mormon Trail. | publisher=Shadow Mountain | location=Salt Lake City | year=1997 | isbn=1-57345-251-3[/tpl] Initial colonization along the Wasatch Front was mostly made by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) with no direct involvement from it. Outside the Wasatch Front, most settlements were directed, planned, organized, and dispatched by leaders of the LDS Church. Settlements were also founded by the railroads, mining companies and non-Mormons.[tpl]citation |contribution-url= http://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/c/COLONIZATION_OF_UTAH.html |contribution= Colonization of Utah |first= Leonard J. |last= Arrington |authorlink= Leonard J.

Natural features of the region, including rivers, mountains, lakes and flora, are also commonly used for names.
The 2010 U.S. Census count puts 2,438,347 of the state's 2,763,885 residents within these cities and towns, accounting for 88.2% of the population. Just over 75% of Utah's population is concentrated in the four Wasatch Front counties of Salt Lake, Utah, Davis, and Weber. The largest city is the state's capital of Salt Lake City with a population of 186,440, and the former coal mining town of Scofield is the smallest town with 24 people.
