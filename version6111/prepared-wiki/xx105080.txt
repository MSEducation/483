The French overseas collectivities ([tpl]lang-fr|collectivité d'outre-mer[/tpl] or COM), like the French regions, are first-order administrative divisions of France. The COMs include some former French overseas territories and other French overseas entities with a particular status, all of which became COMs by constitutional reform on 28 March 2003.
As of 31 March 2011, there were five COMs:
Mayotte was a COM from 1976 until 31 March 2011, when it became an overseas department.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/imprimer/article/2011/03/31/1501415.html |work=Le Monde |title=Mayotte accède à son statut de département dans la confusion |date=31 March 2011|accessdate=31 March 2011|author=Benoît Hopquin[/tpl]

New Caledonia was classified as an overseas territory beginning in 1946, but as a result of the 1998 Nouméa Accord, it gained a special status (statut particulier or statut original) in 1999. A New Caledonian citizenship was established, and a gradual transfer of power from the French state to New Caledonia itself was begun, to last from fifteen to twenty years.
