The Wile Carding Mill is a defunct carding mill, in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Canada. The mill is now operated as a museum.
This water-powered mill was owned and operated by the Wile family from 1860 to 1968. The Wiles ran the mill but employed a number of workers, usually unmarried women, to operate the machinery. The mill was powered by a 7 horsepower (5Â kW) overshot waterwheel using the water of Shady Brook, a tributary of the Lahave River.
