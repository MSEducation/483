The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and most powerful particle collider, built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) from 1998 to 2008. Its aim is to allow physicists to test the predictions of different theories of particle physics and high-energy physics, and particularly prove or disprove the existence of the theorized Higgs particle[tpl]cite web|year=2008|title=Missing Higgs|url=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Science/Higgs-en.html|publisher=CERN|accessdate=2008-10-10[/tpl] and of the large family of new particles predicted by supersymmetric theories.[tpl]cite web|year=2008|title=Towards a superforce|url=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Science/Superforce-en.html|publisher=CERN|accessdate=2008-10-10[/tpl] The Higgs particle was confirmed by data from the LHC in 2013. The LHC is expected to address some of the unsolved questions of physics, advancing human understanding of physical laws. It contains seven detectors, each designed for specific kinds of research.
The LHC was built in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 countries, as well as hundreds of universities and laboratories.[tpl]cite news|first=Roger|last=Highfield|date=16 September 2008|title=Large Hadron Collider: Thirteen ways to change the world|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/large-hadron-collider/3351899/Large-Hadron-Collider-thirteen-ways-to-change-the-world.html|work=Telegraph|accessdate=2008-10-10|location=London[/tpl] It lies in a tunnel [tpl]convert|27|km|mi[/tpl] in circumference, as deep as [tpl]convert|175|m|ft[/tpl] beneath the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva, Switzerland.
As of 2014, the LHC remains one of the largest and most complex experimental facilities ever built. Its synchrotron is designed to initially collide two opposing particle beams of either protons at up to 7 teraelectronvolts [tpl]nowrap|(7 TeV[/tpl] or [tpl]nowrap|1.12 microjoules)[/tpl] per nucleon, or lead nuclei at an energy of 574 TeV (92.0 µJ) per nucleus (2.76 TeV per nucleon-pair),[tpl]cite web|date=January 2008|title=What is LHCb|url=http://cdsmedia.cern.ch/img/CERN-Brochure-2008-001-Eng.pdf|work=CERN FAQ|publisher=CERN Communication Group|page=44|accessdate=2010-04-02[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Large Hadron Collider rewards scientists watching at Caltech|work=Los Angeles Times|date=31 March 2010|author=Amina Khan|accessdate=2010-04-02|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/31/science/la-sci-hadron31-2010mar31[/tpl] with energies to be doubled to around 14 TeV collision energy — more than seven times any predecessor collider — by around 2015.

By November 2012, the LHC had discovered two previously unobserved particles (the χb (3P)) bottomonium state and a massive 125 GeV boson (which subsequent results confirmed to be the long-sought Higgs boson), created a quark–gluon plasma, and recorded the first observations of the very rare decay of the Bs meson into two muons (Bs0 → μ+μ-) (a major test of supersymmetry).
The LHC operated at 3.5 TeV per beam in 2010 and 2011 and at 4 TeV in 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2012/PR01.12E.html|title=LHC to run at 4 TeV per beam in 2012|author=CERN Press Office|date=13 February 2012|publisher=CERN[/tpl] It operated for two months in 2013 colliding protons with lead nuclei, and went into shutdown for upgrades to increase beam energy to 6.5 TeV per beam, with reopening planned for early 2015.[tpl]cite web|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press-releases/2012/12/first-lhc-protons-run-ends-new-milestone|title=The first LHC protons run ends with new milestone|author=CERN Press Office|date=17 December 2012|publisher=CERN[/tpl]

==Background==

The term hadron refers to composite particles composed of quarks held together by the strong force (as atoms and molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force). The best-known hadrons are protons and neutrons; hadrons also include mesons such as the pion and kaon, which were discovered during cosmic ray experiments in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
A collider is a type of a particle accelerator with directed beams of particles. In particle physics colliders are used as a research tool: they accelerate particles to very high kinetic energies and let them impact other particles. Analysis of the byproducts of these collisions gives scientists good evidence of the structure of the subatomic world and the laws of nature governing it. Many of these byproducts are produced only by high energy collisions, and they decay after very short periods of time. Thus many of them are hard or near impossible to study in other ways.

==Purpose==

Physicists hope that the LHC will help answer some of the fundamental open questions in physics, concerning the basic laws governing the interactions and forces among the elementary objects, the deep structure of space and time, and in particular the interrelation between quantum mechanics and general relativity, where current theories and knowledge are unclear or break down altogether. Data are also needed from high energy particle experiments to suggest which versions of current scientific models are more likely to be correct – in particular to choose between the Standard Model and Higgsless models and to validate their predictions and allow further theoretical development. Many theorists expect new physics beyond the Standard Model to emerge at the TeV energy level, as the Standard Model appears to be unsatisfactory. Issues possibly to be explored by LHC collisions include:G. F. Giudice, A Zeptospace Odyssey: A Journey into the Physics of the LHC, Oxford University Press, Oxford 2010, ISBN 978-0-19-958191-71.[tpl]cite news|author=Brian Greene|date=11 September 2008|title=The Origins of the Universe: A Crash Course|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/opinion/12greene.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-04-17[/tpl]
Other open questions that may be explored using high energy particle collisions:

==Design==

The LHC is the world's largest and highest-energy particle accelerator.[tpl]cite journal|author=Joel Achenbach|date=March 2008|title=The God Particle|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/03/god-particle/achenbach-text|journal=National Geographic Magazine|accessdate=2008-02-25[/tpl] The collider is contained in a circular tunnel, with a circumference of [tpl]convert|27|km|mi[/tpl], at a depth ranging from [tpl]convert|50|to|175|m[/tpl] underground.
The [tpl]convert|3.8|m|adj=on[/tpl] wide concrete-lined tunnel, constructed between 1983 and 1988, was formerly used to house the Large Electron–Positron Collider.[tpl]cite web|year=2008|title=The Z factory|url=http://public.web.cern.ch/PUBLIC/en/Research/LEP-en.html|publisher=CERN|accessdate=2009-04-17[/tpl] It crosses the border between Switzerland and France at four points, with most of it in France. Surface buildings hold ancillary equipment such as compressors, ventilation equipment, control electronics and refrigeration plants.
The collider tunnel contains two adjacent parallel beamlines (or beam pipes) that intersect at four points, each containing a proton beam, which travel in opposite directions around the ring. Some [tpl]nowrap|1,232 dipole magnets[/tpl] keep the beams on their circular path (see image[tpl]cite book | editor1-first=E. M. | editor1-last=Henley | editor2-first=S. D. | editor2-last=Ellis | title=100 Years of Subatomic Physics | publisher=World Scientific | year=2013 | isbn=978-981-4425-80-3 | url = http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/8605[/tpl]), while an additional [tpl]nowrap|392 quadrupole magnets[/tpl] are used to keep the beams focused, in order to maximize the chances of interaction between the particles in the four intersection points, where the two beams will cross. In total, over [tpl]nowrap|1,600 superconducting magnets[/tpl] are installed, with most weighing over 27 tonnes.[tpl]cite journal|author=Dr. Stephen Myers|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1142/S0217751X13300354|title=The Large Hadron Collider 2008-2013|date=4 October 2013|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|volume=28|issue=25|pages=1330035-1–1330035-65|doi=10.1142/S0217751X13300354[/tpl] Approximately 96 tonnes of superfluid helium 4 is needed to keep the magnets, made of copper-clad niobium-titanium, at their operating temperature of [tpl]convert|1.9|K|C[/tpl], making the LHC the largest cryogenic facility in the world at liquid helium temperature.
When running at full design power of 7 TeV per beam, once or twice a day, as the protons are accelerated from 450 GeV to 7 TeV, the field of the superconducting dipole magnets will be increased from 0.54 to [tpl]nowrap|8.3 teslas (T)[/tpl]. The protons will each have an energy of 7 TeV, giving a total collision energy of 14 TeV. At this energy the protons have a Lorentz factor of about 7,500 and move at about [tpl]gaps|0.999|999|991|u=c[/tpl], or about 3 metres per second slower than the speed of light (c).[tpl]cite web|title=LHC: How Fast do These Protons Go?|url=http://journal.batard.info/post/2008/09/12/lhc-how-fast-do-these-protons-go|work=yogiblog|accessdate=2008-10-29[/tpl] It will take less than [tpl]nowrap|90 microseconds (μs)[/tpl] for a proton to travel once around the main ring – a speed of about [tpl]nowrap|11,000 revolutions[/tpl] per second. Rather than continuous beams, the protons will be bunched together, into [tpl]nowrap|2,808 bunches[/tpl], [tpl]nowrap|115 billion protons in each bunch[/tpl] so that interactions between the two beams will take place at discrete intervals never shorter than [tpl]nowrap|25 nanoseconds (ns)[/tpl] apart. However it will be operated with fewer bunches when it is first commissioned, giving it a bunch crossing interval of [tpl]nowrap|75 ns[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=LHC commissioning with beam|url=http://lhc-commissioning.web.cern.ch/lhc-commissioning/|publisher=CERN|accessdate=2009-04-17[/tpl] The design luminosity of the LHC is 1034 cm−2s−1, providing a bunch collision rate of 40 MHz.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1228285/files/ATL-DAQ-PROC-2009-044.pdf|title=Operational Experience of the ATLAS High Level Trigger with Single-Beam and Cosmic Rays|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-10-29[/tpl]
Prior to being injected into the main accelerator, the particles are prepared by a series of systems that successively increase their energy. The first system is the linear particle accelerator LINAC 2 generating 50-MeV protons, which feeds the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB). There the protons are accelerated to 1.4 GeV and injected into the Proton Synchrotron (PS), where they are accelerated to 26 GeV. Finally the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is used to further increase their energy to 450 GeV before they are at last injected (over a period of 4 minutes 20 seconds) into the main ring. Here the proton bunches are accumulated, accelerated (over a period of [tpl]nowrap|20 minutes[/tpl]) to their peak 4-TeV energy, and finally circulated for 10 to [tpl]nowrap|24 hours[/tpl] while collisions occur at the four intersection points.[tpl]cite web|author=Jörg Wenninger|date=November 2007|title=Operational challenges of the LHC|url=http://irfu.cea.fr/Phocea/file.php?class=std&file=Seminaires/1595/Dapnia-Nov07-partB.ppt|format=PowerPoint|page=53|accessdate=2009-04-17[/tpl]
The LHC physics program is mainly based on proton–proton collisions. However, shorter running periods, typically one month per year, with heavy-ion collisions are included in the program. While lighter ions are considered as well, the baseline scheme deals with lead ions[tpl]cite web|date=1 November 2007|title=Ions for LHC (I-LHC) Project|url=http://project-i-lhc.web.cern.ch/project-i-lhc/Welcome.htm|publisher=CERN|accessdate=2009-04-17[/tpl] (see A Large Ion Collider Experiment). The lead ions will be first accelerated by the linear accelerator LINAC 3, and the Low-Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) will be used as an ion storage and cooler unit. The ions will then be further accelerated by the PS and SPS before being injected into LHC ring, where they will reach an energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon (or 575 TeV per ion), higher than the energies reached by the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The aim of the heavy-ion program is to investigate quark–gluon plasma, which existed in the early universe.

===Detectors===

Seven detectors have been constructed at the LHC, located underground in large caverns excavated at the LHC's intersection points. Two of them, the ATLAS experiment and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), are large, general purpose particle detectors. A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) and LHCb, have more specific roles and the last three, TOTEM, MoEDAL and LHCf, are very much smaller and are for very specialized research. The BBC's summary of the main detectors is:[tpl]cite news|author=Paul Rincon|date=10 September 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7604293.stm|title='Big Bang' experiment starts well|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-04-17[/tpl]

===Computing and analysis facilities===

The LHC Computing Grid is an international collaborative project that consists of a grid-based computer network infrastructure connecting 140 computing centers in 35 countries (over 170 in 36 countries as of 2012). It was designed by CERN to handle the significant volume of data produced by LHC experiments.
By 2012 data from over 300 trillion (3 x 1014) LHC proton-proton collisions had been analyzed,Hunt for Higgs boson hits key decision point LHC collision data was being produced at approximately 25 petabytes per year, and the LHC Computing Grid had become the world's largest computing grid (as of 2012), comprising over 170 computing facilities in a worldwide network across 36 countries.

==Operational history==

===Inaugural tests===

The first beam was circulated through the collider on the morning of 10 September 2008. CERN successfully fired the protons around the tunnel in stages, three kilometres at a time. The particles were fired in a clockwise direction into the accelerator and successfully steered around it at 10:28 local time.[tpl]cite press|date=10 September 2008|title=First beam in the LHC – Accelerating science|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2008/PR08.08E.html|publisher=CERN Press Office|accessdate=2008-09-10[/tpl] The LHC successfully completed its major test: after a series of trial runs, two white dots flashed on a computer screen showing the protons travelled the full length of the collider. It took less than one hour to guide the stream of particles around its inaugural circuit.[tpl]cite news|author=Mark Henderson|date=10 September 2008|title=Scientists cheer as protons complete first circuit of Large Hadron Collider|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/article1967054.ece|work=Times Online|accessdate=2008-10-06|location=London[/tpl] CERN next successfully sent a beam of protons in a counterclockwise direction, taking slightly longer at one and a half hours due to a problem with the cryogenics, with the full circuit being completed at 14:59.

===2008 quench incident===

On 19 September 2008, a magnet quench occurred in about 100 bending magnets in sectors 3 and 4, where an electrical fault led to a loss of approximately six tonnes of liquid helium (the magnets' cryogenic coolant), which was vented into the tunnel. The escaping vapor expanded with explosive force, damaging over 50 superconducting magnets and their mountings, and contaminating the vacuum pipe, which also lost vacuum conditions.[tpl]cite web|date=15 October 2008|title=Interim Summary Report on the Analysis of the 19 September 2008 Incident at the LHC|url= https://edms.cern.ch/file/973073/1/Report_on_080919_incident_at_LHC__2_.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=CERN|id=EDMS 973073|accessdate=2009-09-28[/tpl]
Shortly after the incident CERN reported that the most likely cause of the problem was a faulty electrical connection between two magnets, and that – due to the time needed to warm up the affected sectors and then cool them back down to operating temperature – it would take at least two months to fix.[tpl]cite press|date=20 September 2008|title=Incident in LHC sector 3–4|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2008/PR09.08E.html|publisher=CERN Press Office|accessdate=2009-09-28[/tpl] CERN released an interim technical report and preliminary analysis of the incident on 15 and 16 October 2008 respectively,[tpl]cite press|date=16 October 2008|title=CERN releases analysis of LHC incident|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2008/PR14.08E.html|publisher=CERN Press Office|accessdate=2009-09-28[/tpl] and a more detailed report on 5 December 2008.[tpl]cite press|date=5 December 2008|title=LHC to restart in 2009|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2008/PR17.08E.html|publisher=CERN Press Office|accessdate=2008-12-08[/tpl] The analysis of the incident by CERN confirmed that an electrical fault had indeed been the cause. The faulty electrical connection had led (correctly) to a failsafe power abort of the electrical systems powering the superconducting magnets, but had also caused an electric arc (or discharge) which damaged the integrity of the supercooled helium's enclosure and vacuum insulation, causing the coolant's temperature and pressure to rapidly rise beyond the ability of the safety systems to contain it, and leading to a temperature rise of about 100 degrees celsius in some of the affected magnets. Energy stored in the superconducting magnets and electrical noise induced in other quench detectors also played a role in the rapid heating. Around two tonnes of liquid helium escaped explosively before detectors triggered an emergency stop, and a further four tonnes leaked at lower pressure in the aftermath. A total of 53 magnets were damaged in the incident and were repaired or replaced during the winter shutdown.[tpl]cite press|date=30 April 2009|title=Final LHC magnet goes underground|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2009/PR06.09E.html|publisher=CERN Press Office|accessdate=2009-08-04[/tpl]
In the original timeline of the LHC commissioning, the first "modest" high-energy collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 900 GeV were expected to take place before the end of September 2008, and the LHC was expected to be operating at 10 TeV by the end of 2008.[tpl]cite press|date=7 August 2008|title=CERN announces start-up date for LHC|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2008/PR06.08E.html|publisher=CERN Press Office[/tpl] However, due to the delay caused by the above-mentioned incident, the collider was not operational until November 2009.[tpl]cite press|publisher=CERN Press Office|date=9 February 2009|title=CERN management confirms new LHC restart schedule|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2009/PR02.09E.html|accessdate=2009-02-10[/tpl] Despite the delay, LHC was officially inaugurated on 21 October 2008, in the presence of political leaders, science ministers from CERN's 20 Member States, CERN officials, and members of the worldwide scientific community.[tpl]cite press|date=21 October 2008|title=CERN inaugurates the LHC|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2008/PR16.08E.html|publisher=CERN Press Office|accessdate=2008-10-21[/tpl]
Most of 2009 was spent on repairs and reviews from the damage caused by the quench incident, along with two further vacuum leaks identified in July 2009 which pushed the start of operations to November of that year.[tpl]cite web|date=16 July 2009|title=News on the LHC|publisher=CERN|url=http://user.web.cern.ch/user/news/2009/090716.html|accessdate=2009-09-28[/tpl]

===Full operation===

On 20 November 2009, low-energy beams circulated in the tunnel for the first time since the incident, and shortly after, on 30 November, the LHC achieved 1.18 TeV per beam to become the world's highest-energy particle accelerator, beating the Tevatron's previous record of 0.98 TeV per beam held for eight years.[tpl]cite press|date=30 November 2009|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2009/PR18.09E.html|title=LHC sets new world record|publisher=CERN|accessdate=2010-03-02[/tpl]
The early part of 2010 saw the continued ramp-up of beam in energies and early physics experiments towards 3.5 TeV per beam and on 30 March 2010, LHC set the present record for high-energy collisions by colliding proton beams at a combined energy level of 7 TeV. The attempt was the third that day, after two unsuccessful attempts in which the protons had to be "dumped" from the collider and new beams had to be injected.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/article329160.ece|title=Big Bang Machine sets collision record|agency=Associated Press|date=30 March 2010|work=The Hindu[/tpl] This also marked the start of its main research program.
The first proton run ended on 4 November 2010. A run with lead ions started on 8 November 2010, and ended on 6 December 2010,[tpl]cite press|date=8 November 2010|title=CERN completes transition to lead-ion running at the LHC|url=http://public.web.cern.ch/press/pressreleases/Releases2010/PR21.10E.html|publisher=CERN|accessdate=2010-11-08[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] allowing the ALICE experiment to study matter under extreme conditions similar to those shortly after the Big Bang.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2010/45/News%20Articles/1302710?ln=en|title=The Latest from the LHC : Last period of proton running for 2010. – CERN Bulletin|publisher=Cdsweb.cern.ch|date=1 November 2010|accessdate=2011-08-17[/tpl]
CERN originally planned that the LHC would run through to the end of 2012, with a short break at the end of 2011 to allow for an increase in beam energy from 3.5 to 4 TeV per beam. At the end of 2012 the LHC would be shut down until around 2015 to allow upgrade to a planned beam energy of 7 TeV per beam. In late 2012, in light of the July 2012 discovery of a new particle, the shutdown was postponed for some weeks into early 2013, to allow additional data to be obtained prior to shutdown.

===Timeline of operations===

==Findings==

CERN scientists estimated that, if the Standard Model is correct, a single Higgs boson would be produced every few hours, and that over a few years enough data to confirm or disprove the Higgs boson unambiguously and to obtain sufficient results concerning supersymmetric particles would be gathered to draw meaningful conclusions. Some extensions of the Standard Model predict additional particles, such as the heavy W' and Z' gauge bosons, which may also lie within reach of the LHC to discover.[tpl]cite news|author=P.

The first physics results from the LHC, involving 284 collisions which took place in the ALICE detector, were reported on 15 December 2009. The results of the first proton–proton collisions at energies higher than Fermilab's Tevatron proton–antiproton collisions were published by the CMS collaboration in early February 2010, yielding greater-than-predicted charged-hadron production.
After the first year of data collection, the LHC experimental collaborations started to release their preliminary results concerning searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model in proton-proton collisions.[tpl]cite journal|author=V.

On 24 May 2011, it was reported that quark–gluon plasma (the densest matter besides black holes) has been created in the LHC.
Between July and August 2011, results of searches for the Higgs boson and for exotic particles, based on the data collected during the first half of the 2011 run, were presented in conferences in Grenoble[tpl]cite web|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2011/PR09.11E.html|title=LHC experiments present their latest results at Europhysics Conference on High Energy Physics|author=CERN Press Office|publisher=Press.web.cern.ch|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=2011-09-01[/tpl] and Mumbai.[tpl]cite web|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2011/PR14.11E.html|title=LHC experiments present latest results at Mumbai conference|author=CERN Press Office|publisher=Press.web.cern.ch|date=22 August 2011|accessdate=2011-09-01[/tpl] In the latter conference it was reported that, despite hints of a Higgs signal in earlier data, ATLAS and CMS exclude with 95% confidence level (using the CLs method) the existence of a Higgs boson with the properties predicted by the Standard Model over most of the mass region between 145 and 466 GeV.[tpl]cite news|author=Pallab Ghosh|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14596367|title=Higgs boson range narrows at European collider|publisher=BBC News|date=22 August 2011[/tpl] The searches for new particles did not yield signals either, allowing to further constrain the parameter space of various extensions of the Standard Model, including its supersymmetric extensions.[tpl]cite news|author=Pallab Ghosh|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14680570|title=LHC results put supersymmetry theory 'on the spot'|publisher=BBC News|date=27 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2011/08/29/lhcb-experiment-sees-standard-model-physics/|title=LHCb experiment sees Standard Model physics|publisher=SLAC/Fermilab|work=Symmetry Breaking|date=29 August 2011|accessdate=2011-09-01[/tpl]
On 13 December 2011, CERN reported that the Standard Model Higgs boson, if it exists, is most likely to have a mass constrained to the range 115–130 GeV.
Both the CMS and ATLAS detectors have also shown intensity peaks in the 124–125 GeV range, consistent with either background noise or the observation of the Higgs boson.[tpl]cite news|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2011/PR25.11E.html|title=ATLAS and CMS experiments present Higgs search status|publisher=CERN|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=2 January 2012[/tpl]
On 22 December 2011, it was reported that a new particle had been observed, the χb (3P) bottomonium state.
On 4 July 2012, both the CMS and ATLAS teams announced the discovery of a boson in the mass region around 125–126 GeV, with a statistical significance at the level of 5 sigma. This meets the formal level required to announce a new particle which is consistent with the Higgs boson, but scientists are cautious as to whether it is formally identified as actually being the Higgs boson, pending further analysis.[tpl]cite news |url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2012/PR17.12E.html |title=CERN experiments observe particle consistent with long-sought Higgs boson|publisher=CERN|date=4 July 2012|accessdate=4 July 2012[/tpl]
On 8 November 2012, the LHCb team reported on an experiment seen as a "golden" test of supersymmetry theories in physics, by measuring the very rare decay of the Bs meson into two muons (Bs0 → μ+μ−). The results, which match those predicted by the non-supersymmetrical Standard Model rather than the predictions of many branches of supersymmetry, show the decays are less common than some forms of supersymmetry predict, though could still match the predictions of other versions of supersymmetry theory. The results as initially drafted are stated to be short of proof but at a relatively high 3.5 sigma level of significance.First evidence for the decay B0>0 → μ+-[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl], 8 Nov 2012, draft, LCHb collaboration.
In August 2013 the team revealed an anomaly in the angular distribution of B meson decay products which could not be predicted by the Standard Model; this anomaly had a statistical certainty of 4.5 sigma, just short of the 5 sigma needed to be officially recognized as a discovery. It is unknown what the cause of this anomaly would be, although the Z' boson has been suggested as a possible candidate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/hints-of-new-physics-detected-in-the-lhc-130802.htm|title=Hints of New Physics Detected in the LHC?[/tpl]

==Proposed upgrade==

After some years of running, any particle physics experiment typically begins to suffer from diminishing returns: as the key results reachable by the device begin to be completed, later years of operation discover proportionately less than earlier years. A common outcome is to upgrade the devices involved, typically in energy, in luminosity, or in terms of improved detectors. As well as the planned 2013–2015 increase to its intended 14 TeV collision energy, a luminosity upgrade of the LHC, called the High Luminosity LHC, has also been proposed,[tpl]cite web|author=F. Ruggerio|date=29 September 2005|url=http://chep.knu.ac.kr/ICFA-Seminar/upload/9.29/Morning/session1/Ruggiero-ICFA-05.pdf|title=LHC upgrade (accelerator)|work=8th ICFA Seminar|accessdate=2009-09-28[/tpl] to be made in 2018 after ten years of operation.
The optimal path for the LHC luminosity upgrade includes an increase in the beam current (i.e. the number of protons in the beams) and the modification of the two high-luminosity interaction regions, ATLAS and CMS. To achieve these increases, the energy of the beams at the point that they are injected into the (Super) LHC should also be increased to [tpl]nowrap|1 TeV[/tpl]. This will require an upgrade of the full pre-injector system, the needed changes in the Super Proton Synchrotron being the most expensive. Currently the collaborative research effort of LHC Accelerator Research Program, LARP, is conducting research into how to achieve these goals.[tpl]cite web|date=5–6 June 2007|title=DOE Review of LARP|url=http://www-td.fnal.gov/LHC/USLARP.html|publisher=Fermilab|accessdate=2011-06-09[/tpl]

==Cost==

With a budget of 7.5 billion euros (approx. $9bn or £6.19bn as of June 2010), the LHC is one of the most expensive scientific instruments[tpl]cite web|url=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/LHC/LHC-en.html|title=CERN – The Large Hadron Collider|publisher=Public.web.cern.ch|date=|accessdate=2010-08-28[/tpl] ever built.[tpl]cite web|author=Agence Science-Presse|url=http://www.lienmultimedia.com/article.php3?id_article=22468|language=French|title=LHC: Un (très) petit Big Bang|publisher=Lien Multimédia|date=7 December 2009|accessdate=2010-10-29[/tpl] [tpl]Google translation|en|fr|http://www.lienmultimedia.com/article.php3?id_article[tpl]=[/tpl]22468[/tpl] The total cost of the project is expected to be of the order of 4.6bn Swiss francs (CHF) (approx. $4.4bn, €3.1bn, or £2.8bn as of Jan 2010) for the accelerator and 1.16bn (CHF) (approx. $1.1bn, €0.8bn, or £0.7bn as of Jan 2010) for the CERN contribution to the experiments.[tpl]cite web|year=2007|title=How much does it cost?|url=http://askanexpert.web.cern.ch/AskAnExpert/en/Accelerators/LHCgeneral-en.html#3|publisher=CERN|accessdate=2009-09-28[/tpl]
The construction of LHC was approved in 1995 with a budget of SFr 2.6bn, with another SFr 210M towards the experiments. However, cost overruns, estimated in a major review in 2001 at around SFr 480M for the accelerator, and SFr 50M for the experiments, along with a reduction in CERN's budget, pushed the completion date from 2005 to April 2007.[tpl]cite web|author=Luciano Maiani|date=16 October 2001|title=LHC Cost Review to Completion|url=http://user.web.cern.ch/User/LHCCost/2001-10-16/LHCCostReview.html|publisher=CERN|accessdate=2001-01-15[/tpl] The superconducting magnets were responsible for SFr 180M of the cost increase. There were also further costs and delays due to engineering difficulties encountered while building the underground cavern for the Compact Muon Solenoid,[tpl]cite journal|author=Toni Feder|year=2001|title=CERN Grapples with LHC Cost Hike|journal=Physics Today|url=http://ptonline.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_54/iss_12/21_2.shtml|volume=54|issue=12|page=21|bibcode=2001PhT....54l..21F|doi=10.1063/1.1445534[/tpl] and also due to faulty parts provided by Fermilab.[tpl]cite web|date=5 April 2007|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSL054919720070405|title=Bursting magnets may delay CERN collider project|agency=Reuters|accessdate=2009-09-28[/tpl] Due to lower electricity costs during the summer, it is expected that the LHC will normally not operate over the winter months,[tpl]cite news|author=Paul Rincon|date=23 September 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7632408.stm|title=Collider halted until next year|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-09-28[/tpl] although an exception was made to make up for the 2008 start-up delays over the 2009/10 winter.

==Computing resources==

Data produced by LHC, as well as LHC-related simulation, was estimated at approximately 15 petabytes per year (max throughput while running not stated).[tpl]cite web|year=2008|title= Worldwide LHC Computing Grid|url= http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/LHC/Computing-en.html|publisher=CERN|accessdate= 2 October 2011 [/tpl]

The Open Science Grid is used as the primary infrastructure in the United States, and also as part of an interoperable federation with the LHC Computing Grid.
The distributed computing project LHC@home was started to support the construction and calibration of the LHC. The project uses the BOINC platform, enabling anybody with an Internet connection and a computer running Mac OSX, Windows or Linux,BOINC client-server technology#Server design weaknesses, tecnologies weakness on win32 api to use their computer's idle time to simulate how particles will travel in the tunnel. With this information, the scientists will be able to determine how the magnets should be calibrated to gain the most stable "orbit" of the beams in the ring.LHC@home, BOINC In August 2011, a second application went live (Test4Theory) which performs simulations against which to compare actual test data, to determine confidence levels of the results.

==Safety of particle collisions==

The experiments at the Large Hadron Collider sparked fears among the public that the particle collisions might produce doomsday phenomena, involving the production of stable microscopic black holes or the creation of hypothetical particles called strangelets.[tpl]cite web|author=Alan Boyle|date=2 September 2008|url=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/02/1326534.aspx|title=Courts weigh doomsday claims|work=Cosmic Log|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2009-09-28[/tpl] Two CERN-commissioned safety reviews examined these concerns and concluded that the experiments at the LHC present no danger and that there is no reason for concern,[tpl]cite web|author=J.-P. Blaizot, J. Iliopoulos, J. Madsen, G.G. Ross, P. Sonderegger, H.-J.

The reports also noted that the physical conditions and collision events which exist in the LHC and similar experiments occur naturally and routinely in the universe without hazardous consequences, including ultra-high-energy cosmic rays observed to impact Earth with energies far higher than those in any man-made collider.

==Operational challenges==

The size of the LHC constitutes an exceptional engineering challenge with unique operational issues on account of the amount of energy stored in the magnets and the beams.[tpl]cite web|date=14 January 1999|title=Challenges in accelerator physics|url=http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/general/acphys.htm|publisher=CERN|accessdate=2009-09-28[/tpl] While operating, the total energy stored in the magnets is [tpl]convert|10|GJ|kgTNT|abbr=on[/tpl] and the total energy carried by the two beams reaches [tpl]convert|724|MJ|kgTNT|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite book|author=John Poole|year=2004|chapter=Beam Parameters and Definitions|chapterurl=https://edms.cern.ch/file/445830/5/Vol_1_Chapter_2.pdf[/tpl]
Loss of only one ten-millionth part (10−7) of the beam is sufficient to quench a superconducting magnet, while the beam dump must absorb [tpl]convert|362|MJ|kgTNT|abbr=on[/tpl] for each of the two beams. These energies are carried by very little matter: under nominal operating conditions (2,808 bunches per beam, 1.15×1011 protons per bunch), the beam pipes contain 1.0×10−9 gram of hydrogen, which, in standard conditions for temperature and pressure, would fill the volume of one grain of fine sand.

==Popular culture==

The Large Hadron Collider gained a considerable amount of attention from outside the scientific community and its progress is followed by most popular science media. The LHC has also inspired works of fiction including novels, TV series, and video games.
The novel Angels & Demons, by Dan Brown, involves antimatter created at the LHC to be used in a weapon against the Vatican. In response CERN published a "Fact or Fiction?" page discussing the accuracy of the book's portrayal of the LHC, CERN, and particle physics in general.[tpl]cite web|date=January 2008|title=Angels and Demons|url=http://public.web.cern.ch/Public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html|publisher=CERN|accessdate=2009-09-28[/tpl] The movie version of the book has footage filmed on-site at one of the experiments at the LHC; the director, Ron Howard, met with CERN experts in an effort to make the science in the story more accurate.[tpl]cite web|author=Ceri Perkins|date=2 June 2008|title=ATLAS gets the Hollywood treatment|url=http://atlas-service-enews.web.cern.ch/atlas-service-enews/news/news_angelphoto.php|work=ATLAS e-News|accessdate=2009-09-28[/tpl]
