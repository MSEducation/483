Toth was part of the "Brock for Broglio" trade on June 15, 1964: he accompanied outfielder Lou Brock and left-handed relief pitcher Jack Spring in a trade to the Cardinals, in exchange for starting pitcher Ernie Broglio, left-handed relief pitcher Bobby Shantz and outfielder Doug Clemens. Brock went on to help lead the Cardinals to three National League championships and two World Series titles — including one in 1964 — and setting a new career record for stolen bases. Toth, who was pitching at Triple-A for the Cubs at the time of the trade, remained in the minor leagues for the rest of his career.Minor league statistics from Baseball Reference
