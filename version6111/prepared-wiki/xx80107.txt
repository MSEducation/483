[[Quebec general election, 1936]]

CATEGORIES: 1936 elections in Canada, Elections in Quebec

The Quebec general election of 1936 was held on August 17, 1936 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada.  The Union Nationale, led by Maurice Duplessis, defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Adélard Godbout.
This marked the end of slightly more than 39 consecutive years in power for the Liberals, who had governed Quebec since the 1897 election.
This 1936 election had been called less than one year after the 1935 election after Liberal premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau resigned because of a scandal. He was replaced by Godbout as Liberal leader and premier.
This was Duplessis's first term in office.  After losing the subsequent 1939 election, he later won four more general elections in a row, and became the dominant politician of his time. It was also the Union Nationale's first election, having been formed from a merger between the Action libérale nationale and the Quebec Conservative Party.
