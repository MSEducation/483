Metzger, The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission and Limitations (Oxford University Press 1977), p. 50. 
According to Gwilliam the Curetonâ€™s Syriac is related to the Peshitto in the same way that the latter is to the Philoxeno-Heraclean revision. It means it represent a stage between that of the Old Syriac and the fully developed Peshitta text. It has no fewer than seventy Old Syriac readings.Bruce M. Metzger, The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission and Limitations (Oxford University Press 1977), p. 55.  It is one of very few early manuscripts with Old Syriac readings.George Anton Kiraz, Comparative Edition of the Syriac Gospels: Aligning the Old Syriac, Gorgias LLC 1996, p. XX. 
The manuscript was acquired by the Royal Library in Berlin in 1865. It was dated by Sachau to the end of the 5th century or the beginning of the 6th century.
The text of the codex was published by G. H. Gwilliam in 1901. A. Allgeier re-examined the colletion of the codex in 1932.
