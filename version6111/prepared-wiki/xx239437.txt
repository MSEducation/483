==Song-writers block==

Constantino suffered writer's block for almost nine months, this being the reason why her third album's release had been delayed. In an interview she stated that she felt pressured after the hit singles from her first album such as Hawak Kamay and Salamat and was apprehensive that her third album would not be as successful after reading some negative reviews and articles about her second album Journey. These articles criticized her compositions as "just a cycle of tunes" and labeled her as an "overnight sensation". The inspirational advice of Raimund Marasigan, the former drummer of the now defunct band The Eraserheads, who promised to co-produce her third album, restored her spirit and motivation for songwriting and resulted in the ten tracks she wrote for Lapit.[tpl]cite web | title =How Yeng Constantino Unlocked nine-month (song) writer's block | url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleid=480791 | accessdate = 2009-06-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title =Yeng Constantino overcomes writer's block caused by negative publicity | url=http://www.pep.ph/news/23761/Yeng-Constantino-overcomes-writer& | accessdate = 2009-11-05[/tpl]
