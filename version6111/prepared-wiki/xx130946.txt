Miloš Šejn (born 10 August 1947 in Jablonec nad Nisou) is a Czech artist (transliteration of the family name: Shein, Schein, Sein, Sejn). 
Born 1947 in Jablonec nad Nisou, Czech Republic, graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy (Charles University) in Prague in 1975 (visual art - Doc. Zdenek Sýkora, art history and aesthetics - professor Petr Wittlich, Doc. Milos Jůzl ). In 1976 Doctor of Philosophy, 1991 appointed professor of painting. In the years 1990-2011 he directed the Intermedia Department at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, a visiting professor at the Academies in Aix-en-Provence, Carrara, Ljubljana, Reykjavík, Stuttgart, The Hague and Vienna.
Milos Sejn works in the fields of visual art, performance and study of visual perception, and conducts workshops, such as Bohemiae Rosa. His artistic concept was formed in his youth when he undertook many trips into the wilderness as a reflection of an inner need to get closer to the secret of nature and observe the miracles that happen in it. From the beginning of the 1960s he took pictures, drew, collected and described his observations of nature during these wanderings. Currently he teaches privately mixed media and the relationship of nature and art as intrinsic needs of the mind, and focuses on immediate creative possibilities, based upon relations between historical humanized landscapes and intact nature. He consciously works in the areas of expressive language among text, visual stroke, body movement, voice, and expansion into space.
