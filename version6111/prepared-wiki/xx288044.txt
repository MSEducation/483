==Early life==

Anastasiya Gryshai was born on 17 October 1985 in Gomel (then Soviet Union) but was raised and spent most of her life in Feodosiya (Crimea, Ukraine). She married Oleksandr (a then 33 years-old local businessman) in 2001 and gave birth to their first child, son Oleksandr Jr., before finishing school. Anastasiya admits that her husband introduced her to swinging sex (which she didn't enjoy) and amateur pornography.
In 2003, Anastasiya's husband Oleksandr was convicted and imprisoned for 8 years for an alleged vehicle arson. The couple states that imprisonment was result of a business dispute and the reason for Anastasiya's out-of-need family-supporting porn career.

==Pornography career==

It was her husband who initiated Anastasiya's successful start as a nude model, particularly for the Penthouse and MET-Art,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.themetart.com/n/nastya-c |title= Met Art Presents Nastya C|website=themetart.com|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl] and later as a hardcore pornography actress.
In 2004, Anastasiya participated in her first professional porn video scene in Saint Petersburg (Russia), where pornography production was briefly declared legal. Since then, she participated in dozens of videos, particularly for the Anabolic, Combat Zone, Devil's Film, Evil Angel, New Sensations, Sineplex and Woodman Entertainment, until at least 2012.[tpl]IAFD name| id=Wiska | gender=female| name=Wiska[/tpl] Her repertoire includes most kinds of hardcore content, including anal sex, double penetration, ass-to-mouth, gangbang and interracial.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.adultfilmdatabase.com/actor/wiska-42603/ |title=Wiska|website=Adult Film Database|publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |type= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doi_brokendate= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=13 August 2013 |quote= |ref= [/tpl]
It is unclear if Anastasiya, a resident and citizen of Ukraine, has ever been engaged in a pornographic production or any other adult entertainment event on Ukraine's territory. She claims she hasn't.[ref]
[tpl]uk icon[/tpl][/ref] According to an adult models database,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eurobabeindex.com/sbandoindex/wiska.html|title=WISKA|website=eurobabeindex.com|publisher=Eurobabesindex|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl] at least some of Anastasiya's shooting was arranged by a Czech adult modeling agency "Pavla" which operates exclusively in Prague.http://www.pavlamodels.com/

==Persecution and asylum seeking==

Circa 2007, Wiska's identity was revealed in Ukraine after a family interview for one of the local tabloids, which attracted journalistic interest and launched her as a national celebrity posing for mainstream media.
In 2010, Ukrainian authorities began recurring persecution of Anastasiya's family on the legal grounds of first a child abuse (including forensic examination of her children for possible sexual assault).Украинская порнозвезда Анастасия ГРИШАЙ (WISKA): «Те, кто проверял нашу семью, собирались провести медицинский осмотр моих детей — двухлетнего Оскара и восьмилетнего Саши — на наличие следов полового акта. Ужас! Психологическая травма на всю жизнь!» Later, when pornography production in the country became illegal, Anastasiya was investigated on this allegation, with her home searched, as well.
The persecution was initiated by a prominent Communist member of parliament representing Crimea.[tpl]cite web |url=http://femen.org/en/news/id/169#post-content |title=Save my children! |date=12 June 2012|publisher=FEMEN|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl]
FEMEN protest movement staged a highly publicized public event in Anastasiya's support which included her interviews and topless posing in traditional FEMEN entourage.
In 2010, Anastasiya and her family moved to the Czech Republic and applied for an asylum while she was pregnant with her third child.
As of August 2013, the family was denied asylum,Чехія остаточно відмовила колишній порноакторці Wiska в статусі біженки [tpl]uk icon[/tpl] but continued to live in the Czech Republic near Prague and applied for legal residence there which they received on 2 September 2013.[tpl]cite news | url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/byvala-pornoherecka-ziskala-v-cesku-trvaly-pobyt-f7n-/domaci.aspx?c=A130902_173752_domaci_jj | title=Bývalá ukrajinská pornoherečka Hagenová získala v Česku trvalý pobyt | work=iDNES.cz | date=2 September 2013 | accessdate=2 September 2013 | author=Jiřička, Jan | language=[tpl]cz icon[/tpl][/tpl]
