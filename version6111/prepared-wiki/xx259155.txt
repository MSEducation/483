Before the election Sunderland council had 48 Labour, 21 Conservative, 1 Liberal Democrat and 5 independent councillors, with the independents being made up of 4 in an alliance and 1 described as an "Independent Conservative".[tpl]cite news | first = Ross | last = Robertson | title = Battle begins for your vote | publisher = Sunderland Echo | date = 2010-04-09 | accessdate = 2010-12-31[/tpl] In total 89 candidates stood for the 25 seats being contested, with a full 25 from the Labour party, 23 Conservatives, 23 Liberal Democrats, 12 British National Party, 2 Green Party and 4 independents. This was a substantial decline in candidates for the British National Party, which in previous years had contested every ward. The 2 seats not contested by the Conservative party in Copt Hill and Houghton were where independent candidates had been successful in previous years, with the Conservative party leader on the council Lee Martin saying the party would not have been able to win the seats. The seats were again contested by independents campaigning against the Houghton Quarry landfill site.
Labour were confident of making gains, pointing to the lowest council tax in the North East and efforts to improve schools and address unemployment. However the Conservatives were also looking to make gains and particularly targeted seats they had previously won in Doxford, Ryhope and Washington South.

The Conservative leader on the council Lee Martin put his parties failure down to a higher turnout due to the election taking place at the same time as the general election and a higher than usual vote share for the Liberal Democrats. Following the election Lee Martin resigned as leader of the Conservative group and was succeeded by Tony Morrissey.[tpl]cite news | title = City Tories name new leader | publisher = Sunderland Echo | date = 2010-05-18 | accessdate = 2011-01-03[/tpl]
