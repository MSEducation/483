[[Big Mac Index]]

The Big Mac Index is published by The Economist as an informal way of measuring the purchasing power parity (PPP) between two currencies and provides a test of the extent to which market exchange rates result in goods costing the same in different countries. It "seeks to make exchange-rate theory a bit more digestible".
The index takes its name from the Big Mac, a hamburger sold at McDonald's restaurants.

==Overview==

The Big Mac index was created by Ng Yat-chiu and introduced in The Economist in September 1986 by Pam Woodall[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/mediadirectory/pam-woodall |title=Pam Woodall | work=The Economist | date=9 June 2011[/tpl] as a semi-humorous illustration of PPP and has been published by that paper annually since then. The index also gave rise to the word burgernomics.[ref]

UBS Wealth Management Research has expanded the idea of the Big Mac index to include the amount of time that an average worker in a given country must work to earn enough to buy a Big Mac.
The working-time based Big Mac index might give a more realistic view of the purchasing power of the average worker, as it takes into account more factors, such as local wages.[ref]

One suggested method of predicting exchange rate movements is that the rate between two currencies should naturally adjust so that a sample basket of goods and services should cost the same in both currencies.  In the Big Mac Index, the basket in question is a single Big Mac burger as sold by the McDonald's fast food restaurant chain.  The Big Mac was chosen because it is available to a common specification in many countries around the world as local McDonald's franchisees at least in theory have significant responsibility for negotiating input prices. For these reasons, the index enables a comparison between many countries' currencies.
The Big Mac PPP exchange rate between two countries is obtained by dividing the price of a Big Mac in one country (in its currency) by the price of a Big Mac in another country (in its currency). This value is then compared with the actual exchange rate; if it is lower, then the first currency is under-valued (according to PPP theory) compared with the second, and conversely, if it is higher, then the first currency is over-valued.
For example, using figures in July 2008:[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11793125|work = The Big Mac Index |title = Sandwiched (Burgernomics says currencies are very dear in Europe but very cheap in Asia)|publisher = The Economist|date = 24 July 2008|accessdate = 2008-11-03| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081101202711/http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11793125| archivedate= 1 November 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The Eurozone is mixed, as prices differ widely in the EU area. As of April 2009, the Big Mac is trading in Germany at [tpl]â‚¬|2.99[/tpl], which translates into [tpl]USD|3.96[/tpl], which would imply that the euro is slightly trading above the PPP, with the difference being 10.9%.

===Variants===

The Economist sometimes produces variants on the theme.  For example in January 2004, it showed a Tall Latte index with the Big Mac replaced by a cup of Starbucks coffee.[ref]

In 2007, an Australian bank's subsidiary, Commonwealth Securities, adapted the idea behind the Big Mac index to create an "iPod index." The bank's theory is that since the iPod is manufactured at a single place, the value of iPods should be more consistent globally. However, this theory can be criticised for ignoring shipping costs, which will vary depending on how far the product is delivered from its "single place" of manufacture in China.[ref]

While economists widely cite the Big Mac index as a reasonable real-world measurement of purchasing power parity,[ref]
