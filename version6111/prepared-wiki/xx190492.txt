Dan Sociu is a writer born May 20, 1978, in Botoşani, Romania. He belongs to the younger generation of poets, the so-called poets of 2000, who are often called representatives of "Miserabilism" by Romanian literary critics. This expression defines both a tendency to take on the pose of anti-hero and biographical writing which puts an emphasis on the banality of everyday life, allowing itself to be influenced by American popular literature.
