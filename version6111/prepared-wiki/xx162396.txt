He was Mayor of Hamilton from 2004 to May 2007. When he resigned to become the chief executive of Hamilton City Council, he was replaced by deputy mayor and former Member of Parliament Bob Simcock who said "The city has been in the fortunate position of having a mayor and council to be proud of over the last term and I intend to maintain and build on that." Mr Simcock paid tribute to Michael Redman's time as Hamilton mayor saying that it was a special time for the city as all Hamilton residents were able to feel very proud of their mayor, their Council and their city. "Michael has many outstanding qualities including high intelligence, insight and humour, but it was his ability to use his utilise his well developed sense of values that enabled him to always make the right decisions for the city. His decision-making was never influenced by the desire to create popularity or profile. We should all aspire to mirror those attributes."

==Controversy==

On 27 May 2007 Michael Redman had said "The opportunity to apply for the vacant position for CEO of Hamilton City Council was a rare and special prospect" and it was one that brought V8 Supercar racing to Hamilton.[tpl]cite web|last=Bettle|first=Sarah|title=Council appoints Michael Redman as new CEO|url=http://www.hamilton.co.nz/our-council/news/Pages/Council-appoints-Michael-Redman-as-new-CEO.aspx|work=Hamilton City Council website|publisher=Hamilton City Council|accessdate=19 August 2012[/tpl] Controversy over costs erupted and Michael Redman resigned from ATEED on 28 October 2011 after a commercial review of the processes followed by Hamilton City Council in relation to the V8 Supercars Event, commissioned by Hamilton Council from Audit New Zealand in February 2011, raised compliance issues and claimed millions of dollars were spent on the Hamilton V8 Supercars stage without council's full knowledge.[tpl]cite news|last=Orsman|first=Bernard|title=Top official quits over V8 report|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10762404|accessdate=16 August 2012|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=29 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/local-government/news/article.cfm?c_id=250&objectid=10762602 | work=The New Zealand Herald | first=Joanne | last=Carroll | title=Redman may face claim | date=30 October 2011[/tpl] Michael Redman rejected outright the major findings of the Audit NZ report.[tpl]cite news|last=Adams|first=Daniel|title=Redman quits|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/5873709/Redman-quits|accessdate=16 August 2012|newspaper=Waikato Times|date=29 October 2011[/tpl]
On 1 May 2007 Hamilton City Council announced receipt of a report on compliance costs. Chair of the Finance and Audit Committee Roger Hennebry said that the report was an important step in increasing public awareness about how rates were spent - "Compliance costs are growing and growing and will be an area of expenditure that will go under particular scrutiny at a national level over the coming months." "Whilst the report outlines costs incurred for new legislation it also highlights Council's lost revenue as a result of its inability to generate rates on Crown owned land. We estimate this missed revenue to be valued at $2.1m per year." The report identified 60 new pieces of Government legislation enacted since 2000 and summarises the resulting cost to Council though their implementation. The report summary showed costs under four headings totalling over $3m.[tpl]cite web|last=Hennebry|first=Roger|title=Council reports on cost of compliance to Government|url=http://www.hamilton.co.nz/our-council/news/Pages/Council-reports-on-cost-of-compliance-to-  Government.aspx|work=Hamilton City Council website|publisher=Hamilton City Council|accessdate=19 August 2012[/tpl]
In a case study on the review of the Hamilton V8 Supercar race series Audit New Zealand advised "Audit New Zealand's report on the V8 event could be a good guide for local authorities for managing major events." “In most cities in New Zealand, local government is big business. Many local authorities are aware that their major event will be controversial – even before it starts. This could be because of its size, or its community impact, or the amount of funding involved.” “Local authorities should manage all major events on project principles especially around cost, completion times and value. This is particularly important if the event is likely to be costly, or controversial, or both. This, and the regular real-time review of actual performance against the initial business case for the event, is the main lesson from our report."[tpl]cite web|last=Davies|first=Peter|title=Hamilton V8 Supercars case study|url=http://devaudit.pidwell.com/assurance-services/case-studies|work=Audit New Zealand website|publisher=Audit New Zealand|accessdate=19 August 2012[/tpl] A briefing to a journalist led to publication of contested remarks  said to quote from the full report.[tpl]cite web|last=Davies|first=Peter|title=Review of the processes followed by Hamilton City Council in relation to the V8 Supercars Event|url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/images/pdfs/v8s-auditreportforhcc.pdf|work=NewsTalkZB website|publisher=Audit New Zealand|accessdate=19 August 2012[/tpl] For example the suggestion that costs soared from $7m to almost $39m may be compared with section 10.1.9 'Early information on costs' which states (in full): "We were advised by several current and former Councillors during interviews for this review that when the Council committed to the V8 event in 2006 the costs to HCC had been indicated as being $7 million. However, in reviewing this claim we found that the 2006-16 LTCCP referred to the race event as having an infrastructure cost of $7 million together with “the fee to be paid to promoters to run the event”. Consequently, Council had clear information at the time it finalised the LTCCP (June 2006) that the total cost for the race event over seven years would be in excess of $20 million. We do not accept that the race event could ever have been understood to be only a $7 million financial commitment to HCC. The passage of time may have led to some misunderstanding about this."
In October 2011 the Hamilton City Council considered legal action against Michael Redman [tpl]cite news|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10764494 | work=The New Zealand Herald | first=Nikki | last=Preston | title=Report suggests council legal action against Redman over V8s | date=8 November 2011[/tpl] but following legal advice decided against it in private. In a press release on 26 October 2011 former Mayor Bob Simcock said "By placing an unjustified level of blame on staff, and on Michael Redman in particular, the review has achieved council's shameful goal. While I agree with a number of the recommendations the review has made around process, there is nothing in it that would have led to a different outcome for the event." "For more than four years every significant decision relating to the event was supported by the unanimous vote of 13 councillors. At the time, and given the information that was available to council, councillors made reasonable decisions. If with the knowledge of hindsight, the community believes we got it wrong, we all share that responsibility. Councillors who blame their decisions on staff are gutless and unfit for public office."[tpl]cite web|last=Adams|first=Daniel|title=Redman, Simcock rubbish race report|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/5866499/Redman-Simcock-rubbish-race-report|work=Waikato Times website|publisher=Waikato Times|accessdate=19 August 2012[/tpl]
