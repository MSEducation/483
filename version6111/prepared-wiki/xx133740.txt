==Career==

Norwich initially bid for Crewe striker Mark Rivers on Transfer Deadline Day in March 2001. Another bid was made in May 2001 as Nigel Worthington sought a pacy striker to partner Iwan Roberts, and share the goal scoring responsibilities. Both bids were rejected but in June 2001, Crewe and Norwich came to agreement over a deal worth approximately Â£700,000. Whilst Rivers was on holiday and hadn't signed a contract or passed a medical, the deal was concluded by both clubs as a forgone concussion. Mark finally signed for Norwich at the end of June 2001. 25 year old Rivers had scored 58 goals in 239 games for Crewe,including 10 goals in 38 appearances in 2000/01. 
Mark made 37 appearances during Norwich's almost-successful 2001/02 campaign but only completed 90minutes on one occasion giving the Carrow Road faithful concern over his long term fitness. Mark started the 2002/03 season well but suffered an injury against Watford that saw him miss over a month's action. He finished the campaign with 32 appearances and 4 goals to his credit.
Another good start ot 2003/04 saw him quickly established as the Canaries' leading scorer until injury again forced him out of the side. When fit, he could not displace either loan signing Kevin Harper or youngster Ian Henderson. Rumours from Carrow Road also suggested a bust-up between Rivers and manager Nigel Worthington. Unable to get a first team place, Mark made it clear that he needed first team football. Crewe offered to take him on loan in January 2004 but Norwich refused and Mark returned to the City team in the 1-0 defeat to Bradford on 10 January 2004, albeit as substitute.
In June 2004, Rivers was the subject of speculation linking him with a move to Burnley. At the beginning of July 2004, Norwich and Rivers agreed to cancel his contract as he wanted first team football. He joined neighbours Ipswich Town almost immediately, playing in their pre-season friendly against Peterborough on 10 July 2004. When Ipswich decided against taking him on, Mark returned to Crewe on trial. He signed a two year deal with his former club on 20 July at half-time during Crewe's friendly with Everton
On 23 January 2006, Mark signed for Carlisle until the end of the 2005/6 season. He parted company with them on mutual terms on 28 April 2006.
