==Plot==

In 1974, Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky) travels to Los Angeles, California, for the spring break to learn more about her deceased biological mother. First she was a spunky, hypochondriac 11-year-old full of medical issues; now she is a lively yet more serious 13-year-old, "ready for her own apartment." By this time, her father Harry (Dan Aykroyd) is married to Shelly DeVoto (Jamie Lee Curtis), who is now pregnant, her Uncle Phil (Richard Masur) now lives in Los Angeles working as a mechanic, and her grandmother has died. She still wears the mood ring retrieved for her by her late friend Thomas J. (Macaulay Culkin) at the cost of his life.
Vada has her spring break coming up and her school assignment is to do an essay on someone she admires but has never met. She decides that she wants to do it on her mother but quickly realizes she knows very little about her. She manages to get her father to agree to let her go to L. A. to stay with her Uncle Phil and do some research on her mother. Once there, she finds herself under the protection of Nick (Austin O'Brien), Phil's girlfriend's (Christine Ebersole) son, who at first is very annoyed at losing his own spring break to escort a "hick girl" around town. However, he soon becomes more involved in the difficult search. The relationship between them, which originally starts out as a reluctant one, slowly turns into something much stronger as she learns more about her mother. The two start supporting each other and experience first love along the way.
The movie includes an a cappella performance of the Chaplin song "Smile" by Angeline Ball, who plays Vada's mother.
