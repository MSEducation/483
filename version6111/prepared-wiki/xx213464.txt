Martin was eliminated after the fifth challenge, "Welcome to the Jungle," when she and her teammate Daniel were tasked with designing a look for Brooke Shields to wear on Season 2 of Lipstick Jungle. The judges questioned her taste and made her the fifth person eliminated from the competition.  She came back with other eliminated designers in the ninth challenge to assist the remaining contestants on creating an avant garde design inspired by their zodiac signs.  She worked with Korto Momolu to design an outfit based around Aquarius.
