[[Ten-lined June beetle]]

CATEGORIES: Scarabaeidae, Beetles of North America

The ten-lined June beetle, also known as the watermelon beetle, is a scarab beetle, living in the western United States and Canada. The adults are attracted to light and feed on foliage but do not damage the plants. They can make a hissing sound when touched or otherwise disturbed, which can resemble the hissing of a bat. This sound is made by their wings pushing down, forcing the air out between their wings and back. They can be an agricultural pest affecting a wide range of crops because their larvae feed on plant roots and can weaken or kill the plants.[tpl]cite web|title=Tenlined June beetle|url=http://jenny.tfrec.wsu.edu/opm/displaySpecies.php?pn=640|work=Orchard Pest Management Online|publisher=Washington State University Tree Fruit Research & Extension Center|accessdate=26 June 2012[/tpl]

==Description==

They are relatively large in size, some growing to sizes as large as an 1.25 inches (3 cm) or more. As in other members of this genus, the males have large distinctive antennae consisting of several lamellate plates, which they close up when threatened. The antennae are used to detect pheromones emitted by the females.[tpl]cite web|last=Department of Entomology|title=Ten Lined June Beetle|url=http://entomology.wsu.edu/outreach/bug-info/ten-lined-june-beetle/|publisher=Washington State University|accessdate=5 July 2013[/tpl]  The wing covers (elytra) have four long white stripes and one short stripe each. The underside of the thorax is covered with brownish hairs. This beetle does not bite.  In some regions the meat of the scarab beetle is consumed as a natural aphrodisiac, however they are only edible if eaten raw.  When cooked, the scarab beetle releases all of its toxins in concentrated amounts through the thorax.  They can become numerous enough to be considered pests.Royal Alberta Museum
