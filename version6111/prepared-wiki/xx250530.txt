==History==

Samuel Sarphati, a physician and city planner, took the initiative to build the hotel, although he died in June 1866 before the hotel opened. The architect of the building was Cornelis Outshoorn. Originally it was the planning to build the front of the hotel towards the present Sarphatistraat. Due to financial problems, only the wing along the Amstel was built.[tpl]nl[/tpl] Amstel Hotel Last visted 16-8-2001.
