==Career==

Hoskins' acting career began in 1968 at the Victoria Theatre, Stoke-on-Trent. He played a servant, Peter, in a production of Romeo and Juliet[tpl]cite web|url=http://safetycurtain.wordpress.com/2014/05/01/bob-hoskins/ |title=Bob Hoskins |date=1 May 2014 |accessdate=1 May 2014[/tpl]. In 1969 he worked at the Unity Theatre. One evening, he was waiting in the Unity Theatre bar for his friend, the actor Roger Frost, to finish an audition. Whilst drinking at the bar, he was given a script and told "You're next."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/1999/oct/09/weekend7.weekend2 |title=Bob Hoskins: Sold as seen |work=The Guardian |date=9 October 1999 |accessdate=26 February 2013[/tpl] He got the part, with Frost ending up his understudy. Frost recalled that "Bob was a natural. He just got up on stage and was brilliant."Karen Moline, Bob Hoskins: an unlikely hero, p17, (Sidgwick & Jackson), 1988, ISBN 0283995084, 9780283995088  His first major television role was in On the Move (1975-6)"On the Move", BFI Film & TV database, an educational series intended to tackle adult illiteracy, in which he played Alf, a removal man who had problems reading and writing. His breakthrough television role came in the original BBC version of Dennis Potter's innovative six-part fantasy-drama Pennies from Heaven (1978) as adulterous sheet music salesman Arthur Parker. Later, he played Iago in Jonathan Miller's BBC Television Shakespeare production of Othello.
Hoskins' performances in British films such as The Long Good Friday (1980) and Mona Lisa (1986) won him the wider approval of the critics and, in the case of the latter, a Cannes Award, Best Actor Golden Globe and BAFTA Awards and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He also delivered comic turns in Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985) and Super Mario Bros. (1993). Hoskins was not initially aware that Super Mario Bros. was based on the popular video game of the same name. His son had asked him what film he was working on, and recognising it, showed Hoskins the video game on the Nintendo video game console. In a 2007 interview with The Guardian, Hoskins spoke of his regret at appearing in Super Mario Bros. He revealed that despite being praised for his performance in the film, he was extremely unhappy with the film and greatly angered by his experiences making it, referring to it as the "worst thing I ever did". During the late 1980s and early 1990s he appeared in advertising for the recently privatised companies of British Gas and British Telecom (now BT Group).
Hoskins had a small role as a rock band's manager in the Pink Floyd film The Wall. He was slated to be a last-minute replacement in the film The Untouchables if star Robert De Niro had not decided to play Al Capone. When De Niro took the part, director Brian De Palma mailed Hoskins a cheque for £20,000 with a "Thank You" note, which prompted Hoskins to call up De Palma and ask him if there were any more movies he didn't want him to be in.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/article.html?Bob_Hoskins_paid_not_to_play_Capone&in_article_id=588604&in_page_id=7&in_a_source= |title=Bob Hoskins paid not to play Capone |work=Metro|location=UK |date=19 March 2009 |accessdate=24 August 2011[/tpl]
Hoskins appeared in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), for which he received a second Golden Globe nomination. Some of Hoskins' other notable appearances include playing opposite Cher in Mermaids (1990), boatswain Smee to Captain Hook in Hook (1991), and as the same character in Neverland (2011), and Uncle Bart, the psychopathic and violent "owner" of Jet Li in Unleashed aka Danny The Dog. He returned to television in productions for the BBC, including Flickers, David Copperfield as Wilkins Micawber (1999) and The Wind in the Willows (2006). He played Nikita Khrushchev as a political commissar in the film Enemy at the Gates (2001). He received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Mrs Henderson Presents, a film he also produced with Norma Heyman.
Hoskins also directed two films, both of which he starred in; The Raggedy Rawney (1988) and Rainbow (1996). In 2009, Hoskins made a return to British television in Jimmy McGovern's drama serial The Street, where he played a publican who stands up to a local gangster. For this role he received his only Emmy when he won Best Actor at the 2010 International Emmys. On 8 August 2012, Hoskins announced his retirement from acting after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2012-08-08/bob-hoskins-retires-from-acting/ |title=Bob Hoskins retires from acting |publisher=Itv.com |date=8 August 2012 |accessdate=26 February 2013[/tpl]
