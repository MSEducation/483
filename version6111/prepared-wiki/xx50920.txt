As an autonomous vehicle, it is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Robotic cars exist mainly as prototypes and demonstration systems.

Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings with such techniques as radar, lidar, GPS, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage."The beginning of the end of driving". Motor Trend. January 2013 issue. Retrieved 7 January 2013. Some autonomous vehicles update their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles to keep track of their position even when conditions change or when they enter uncharted environments.
Some quasi-autonomous demonstration systems date back to the 1920s and the 1930s.

==Definition==

The term "autonomous" is not a generally accepted term in science when used to describe technical artifacts. For example Wood et al. (2012), see reference below, writes "This Article generally uses the term “autonomous,” instead of the term “automated.” We have chosen to use the term “autonomous” because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. “Automated” connotes control or operation by a machine, while “autonomous” connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver’s seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them. Thus, the term “automated” would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts".

==Potential advantages==

An increase in the use of autonomous cars would make possible such benefits as:

 Arth claims that this would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis that would be in near-constant use.[/ref][tpl]cite web|author=254 |url=https://plus.google.com/103583939320326217147/posts/TpN1g1oSVbN|title=Koushik Dutta - Google+ - The Unintended Effects of Driverless Cars Google has been..|publisher=Plus.google.com |date= |accessdate=28 April 2012[/tpl]

==Potential obstacles==

In spite of the various benefits to increased vehicle automation, some foreseeable challenges persist:
