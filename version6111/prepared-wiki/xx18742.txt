[[Merostomata]]

CATEGORIES: Chelicerates

Merostomata is the name given to a grouping of the extinct Eurypterida (sea scorpions) and the Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs). The term was originally used by James Dwight Dana to refer to Xiphosura only, but was emended by Henry Woodward to cover both groups.

==Etymology==

The name "Merostomata" derives from the Greek roots [tpl]lang|el|μηρός[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|el|meros[/tpl], "thigh") and [tpl]Lang|el|στόμα[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|el|stoma[/tpl], "mouth"), in reference to the animals' possession of appendages which are mouthparts at their proximal end, but swimming legs at their distal end.[tpl]cite journal |title=Literary Notices |chapter=A monograph of the British Fossil Crustacea, belonging to the Order Merostomata.

==History==

The scientific consensus at the beginning of the 20th century was that these two marine groups were closely related, and only more distantly related to the terrestrial Arachnida.[tpl]cite book |editor=Richard A.

The shared features of the two groups traditionally grouped in the Merostomata are now thought to be retentions of primitive conditions (symplesiomorphies), and thus the name Merostomata has been recommended to be abandoned.
