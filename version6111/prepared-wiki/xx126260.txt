1,1,1,3,3-Pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) is a hydrofluorocarbon used primarily for closed-cell spray foam insulation produced by Honeywell and in Asia by Sinochem.[tpl]citation|publisher=Sinochem Group|title=Sinochem and Honeywell Announce Formation of Joint Venture in China|date=October 10, 2011|url=http://www.sinochem.com/g831/s1614/t5152.aspx[/tpl]  Honeywell markets HFC-245fa under the Enovate and Genetron 245fa brand names.  HFC-245fa is also known as pentafluoropropane and by its chemical name 1,1,1,3,3,-pentafluoropropane.  Unlike CFC and HCFC blowing agents formerly used for this purpose, it has no ozone depletion potential and is nearly non-toxic.  Although it is intended to remain trapped within the foam insulation, it is practically non biodegradable with a lifetime of 7.2 years when it eventually does escape into the atmosphere.[tpl]citation|publisher=Honeywell|title=HFC-245fa- Product Stewardship Summary|date=December 2007|url=http://www51.honeywell.com/sm/common/documents/Public-Ris-Summary-HFC-245fa.pdf|accessdate=May 13, 2012[/tpl]  It does have a high global warming potential of 950 (950 times the global warming effect of [tpl]CO2[/tpl]).[tpl]citation|title=Other Gases: Hydrofluorocarbons, Perfluorocarbons, and Sulfur Hexafluoride|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration|accessdate=May 13, 2012|url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/archive/gg03rpt/other_gases.html[/tpl][tpl]citation|publisher=European Centre for Ecotoxicology|title=JACC 044 : 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) (CAS No. 460-73-1)|date=June 2004| url=http://www.ecetoc.org/index.php?mact=MCSoap,cntnt01,details,0&cntnt01document_id=114&cntnt01returnid=91|accessdate=May 13, 2012[/tpl]  Honeywell refers to this as "acceptable" in their literature, but they don't include the actual number.
AlliedSignal, who adopted the Honeywell name after acquiring it, decided in 1999 to provide a non ozone depleting blowing agent as an alternative for dichlorofluoroethane (HCFC-141b) and trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11).  Competitors Atofina and General Electric pursued strategies using other agents.  One of the disadvantages of R-245fa is its cost.  In 2000 R-141b cost one US dollar per pound, whereas R-245fa cost $2.50 to $4.00 per pound.[tpl]citation|title=Regulatory Issues Heat Up For Blowing Agents|journal=Chemical and Engineering News Online|volume=78|number=44|url=http://gertrude-old.case.edu/276/materials/C&ENews/C&ENewsBlowing%20Agents.htm|issn= 0009-2347|pages=22â€“23|last=McCoy|first=Michael|date=October 30, 2000[/tpl]  As of 2007, and prior to Sinochem's production it was already a high volume production chemical, with over 1 million pounds produced annually.
