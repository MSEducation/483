In set theory, a tree is a partially ordered set (T, 
==Definition==

A tree is a partially ordered set (poset) (T, A branch of a tree is a maximal chain in the tree (that is, any two elements of the branch are comparable, and any element of the tree not in the branch is incomparable with at least one element of the branch). The length of a branch is the ordinal that is order isomorphic to the branch. For each ordinal α, the α-th level of T is the set of all elements of T of height α. A tree is a κ-tree, for an ordinal number κ, if and only if it has height κ and every level has size less than the cardinality of κ. The width of a tree is the supremum of the cardinalities of its levels.

==Properties==

There are some fairly simply stated yet hard problems in infinite tree theory. Examples of this are the Kurepa conjecture and the Suslin conjecture. Both of these problems are known to be independent of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. König's lemma states that every ω-tree has an infinite branch. On the other hand, it is a theorem of ZFC that there are uncountable trees with no uncountable branches and no uncountable levels; such trees are known as Aronszajn trees. A κ-Suslin tree is a tree of height κ which has no chains or antichains of size κ. In particular, if κ is singular (i.e. not regular) then there exists a κ-Aronszajn tree and a κ-Suslin tree. In fact, for any infinite cardinal κ, every κ-Suslin tree is a κ-Aronszajn tree (the converse does not hold).
The Suslin conjecture was originally stated as a question about certain total orderings but it is equivalent to the statement: Every tree of height ω1 has an antichain of cardinality ω1 or a branch of length ω1.

==Tree (automata theory)==

Following definition of a tree is slightly different from the above formalism. For example, each node of the tree is a word over set of natural numbers (ℕ), which helps this definition to be used in automata theory.
A tree is a set T ⊆ ℕ such that if t.c ∈ T, with t ∈ ℕ* and c ∈ ℕ, then t ∈ T and t.c1 ∈ T for all 0 ≤ c1 A tree is called ranked if there is an order among the successors of each of its nodes. Above definition of tree naturally suggests an order among the successors, which can be used to make the tree ranked. Sometimes, an extra function Ar: Σ → ℕ is defined. This function associates a fixed arity to each symbol of the alphabet. In this case, each t ∈ T has to satisfy Ar(V(t)) = d(t).
For example, above definition is used in the definition of an infinite tree automaton.

===Example===

Let T = {0,1}* and Σ = {a,b}. We define a labeling function V as follows: the labeling for the root node is V(ε) = a and, for every other node t ∈ {0,1}*, the labellings for its successor nodes are V(t.0) = a and V(t.1) = b. It is clear from the picture that T forms a (fully) infinite binary tree.
