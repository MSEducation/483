Utrecht ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|t|r|ɛ|k|t[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-nl|ˈytrɛxt|-|Nl-Utrecht.ogg[/tpl]) is the capital and most populous city in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It is located in the eastern corner of the Randstad conurbation, and is the fourth largest city of the Netherlands with a population of [tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Dutch municipality population|Utrecht[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]YEAR|[tpl]Dutch municipality population|popbaseyear[/tpl][/tpl].
Utrecht's ancient city centre features many buildings and structures from the Early Middle Ages. It has been the religious centre of the Netherlands since the 8th century. Currently it is the see of the Archbishop of Utrecht, the most important Dutch Roman Catholic leader.[tpl]cite web|title=Aartsbisdom Utrecht|url=http://www.aartsbisdom.nl/|language=Dutch|accessdate=2007-12-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Katholiek Nederland|url=http://www.katholieknederland.nl/|language=Dutch|accessdate =2007-12-10[/tpl] Utrecht is also the see of the archbishop of the Old Catholic church, titular head of the Union of Utrecht (Old Catholic), and the location of the offices of the main Protestant church. Until the Dutch Golden Age, Utrecht was the most important city of the Netherlands; then, Amsterdam became its cultural centre and most populous city.
Utrecht is host to Utrecht University, the largest university of the Netherlands, as well as several other institutes for higher education. Due to its central position within the country, it is an important transport hub for both rail and road transport. It has the second highest number of cultural events in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam.[tpl]cite web|author=Gemeente Utrecht|title=Utrecht Monitor 2007|language=Dutch|url=http://www.utrecht.nl/images/Secretarie/Bestuursinformatie/Publicaties2007/UM2007/UtrechtMonitor2007.pdf|accessdate=2008-01-06[/tpl]

==History==

===Origins (until 650)===

Although there is some evidence of earlier inhabitation in the region of Utrecht, dating back to the Stone Age (app. 2200 BCE) and settling in the Bronze Age (app. 1800–800 BCE),[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=163711|title= Gemeente Utrecht, Geschiedenis Utrecht voor 1528[/tpl] the founding date of the city is usually related to the construction of a Roman fortification (castellum), probably built in around 50 CE. These fortresses were designed to house a cohort of about 500 Roman soldiers. Near the fort a settlement would grow housing artisans, traders and soldiers' wives and children.
A line of such fortresses was built after the Roman emperor Claudius decided the empire should not expand further north. To consolidate the border the limes Germanicus defense line was constructed.[tpl]cite book|last=de Bruin|first=R.E.|coauthors=T.J. Hoekstra, A. Pietersma|title=Twintig eeuwen Utrecht, korte geschiedenis van de stad|language=Dutch|publisher=SPOU & Het Utrechts Archief|year=1999|location=Utrecht|isbn=90-5479-040-7[/tpl] This line was located at the borders of the main branch of the river Rhine, which at that time flowed through a more northern bed compared to today, along what is now the Kromme Rijn.
In Roman times, the name of the Utrecht fortress was simply Traiectum denoting its location at a possibility to cross the Rhine. Traiectum became Dutch Trecht. The U comes from Old Dutch "uut" meaning downriver. It was added to distinguish from the other Tricht, Maas-tricht.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hetutrechtsarchief.nl/werkstukken/onderwerpen/ontstaan-utrecht|title=Het ontstaan van de stad Utrecht (tot 100)|author=Het Utrechts Archief|language=Dutch[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|author=Nicoline van der Sijs|year=2001|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/sijs002chro01_01/sijs002chro01_01_0010.htm|title=Chronologisch woordenboek. De ouderdom en herkomst van onze woorden en betekenissen|page=100|location=Amsterdam/Antwerpen|isbn=90-204-2045-3|language=Dutch[/tpl] In 11th-century official documents it was then Latinized as Ultra Traiectum.
Around the year 200, the wooden walls of the fortification were replaced by sturdier tuff stone walls,[tpl]cite book|author=R.P.J. Kloosterman|year=2010|url=http://www.utrecht.nl/images/DSO/monumenten/publicaties/Basisrapportages_Archeologie/BRArch_41_Lichte_Gaard/BrArch41_Lichte_Gaard.pdf|title=Lichte Gaard 9.

From the middle of the 3rd century Germanic tribes regularly invaded the Roman territories. Around 275 the Romans could no longer maintain the northern border and Utrecht was abandoned. Little is known about the next period 270–650. Utrecht is first spoken of again centuries after the Romans left. Under the influence of the growing realms of the Franks a church was built in the 7th century within the walls of the Roman fortress during Dagobert I's reign. In ongoing border conflicts with the Frisians the church was however destroyed.

===Centre of Christianity in the Netherlands (650–1579)===

By the mid-7th century, English and Irish missionaries set out to convert the Frisians. The pope appointed their leader, Willibrordus, bishop of the Frisians; which is usually considered to be the beginning of the Bishopric of Utrecht. In 723, the Frankish leader Charles Martel bestowed the fortress in Utrecht and the surrounding lands as the base of bishops. From then on Utrecht became one of the most influential seats of power for the Roman Catholic Church in the Netherlands.
The see of the archbishops of Utrecht was located at the uneasy northern border of the Carolingian Empire. Furthermore it had to compete with the nearby trading centre Dorestad, also founded near the location of a Roman fortress. After the downfall of Dorestad around 850, Utrecht became one of the most important cities in the Netherlands.[tpl]cite book|last=van der Tuuk|first=Luit|editor=Ria van der Eerden, et al.|title=Jaarboek Oud Utrecht 2005|series=Jaarboek Oud Utrecht|year=2005|publisher=SPOU|location=Utrecht|language=Dutch|isbn=90-71108-24-4|pages=5–40|chapter=Denen in Dorestad[/tpl] The importance of Utrecht as a centre of Christianity is illustrated by the election of the Utrecht-born Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens as pope in 1522 (the last non-Italian pope before John Paul II)Pope Adrian died one year later after his election and although he ordered to build the Paus Huize in Utrecht he never actually saw it.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

====Prince-Bishops====

When the Frankish rulers established the system of feudalism, the Bishops of Utrecht came to exercise worldly power as prince-bishops. The territory of the bishopric  not only included the modern province of Utrecht (Nedersticht, 'lower Sticht'), but also extended to the northeast. The feudal system led to conflict, and the prince-bishopric was at odds with the Counts of Holland and the Dukes of Guelders.[tpl]cite book|last=Janssen|first=H.P.H.|title=Geschiedenis van de Middeleeuwen|year=2002|edition=12th|publisher=Aula|location=Utrecht|language=Dutch|isbn=90-274-5377-2|pages=289–296[/tpl] The Veluwe region was soon seized by Guelders, but large areas in the modern province of Overijssel remained as the Oversticht.

====Clerical buildings====

Several churches and monasteries were built inside, or close to, the city of Utrecht. The most dominant of these was the Cathedral of Saint Martin, inside the old Roman fortress. The construction of the present Gothic building  was begun in 1254 after an earlier romanesque construction had been badly damaged by fire. The choir and transept were finished from 1320 and were followed then by the ambitious Dom tower.  The last part to be constructed was the central nave, from 1420. By that time, however, the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished, the construction of the central nave being suspended before the planned flying buttresses could be finished.
Besides the cathedral there were four collegiate churches in Utrecht: St. Salvator's Church (demolished in the 16th century), on the Dom square, dating back to the early 8th century.[tpl]cite book|last=Stöver|first=R.J.|title=De Salvator- of Oudmunsterkerk te Utrecht, Stichtingsmonument van het bisdom Utrecht|language=Dutch|year=1997|location=Utrecht[/tpl] Saint John (Janskerk), originating in 1040;[tpl]cite web|title=Janskerk Informatie|url=http://www.janskerkutrecht.nl/|accessdate=2008-01-06[/tpl] Saint Peter, building started in 1039[tpl]cite web|title=Sint Pieterskerk Utrecht|url=http://www.planetware.com/utrecht/st-pieterskerk-nl-ut-piet.htm|accessdate =2008-01-05[/tpl] and Saint Mary's church building started around 1090 (demolished in the early 19th century, cloister survives).[tpl]cite book|last=Haverkate|first=H.M.|title=Een kerk van papier.

Besides these churches the city housed Saint Paul's Abbey.[tpl]cite book|last=Broer|first=C.J.C.|title=Uniek in de stad.

Besides these buildings which were part of the official structures of the bishopric; an additional four parish churches were constructed in the city: the Jacobikerk (dedicated to Saint James), founded in the 11th century, with the current Gothic church dating back to the 14th century;[tpl]cite web|title=Jacobikerk|url=http://www.jacobikerk.nl|accessdate=2008-01-06[/tpl] the Buurkerk (Neighbourhood-church) of the 11th-century parish in the centre of the city; Nicolaichurch (dedicated to Saint Nicholas), from the 12th century[tpl]cite web|title=Nicolaikerk|url=http://www.nicolaikerk.nl|accessdate=2008-01-06[/tpl] and the 13th-century Geertekerk (dedicated to Saint Gertrude of Nivelles).[tpl]cite web|title=Geertekerk – Remonstrantse Gemeente Utrecht|url=http://www.geertekerk.nl|accessdate=2008-01-06[/tpl]

====City of Utrecht====

The location on the banks of the river Rhine allowed Utrecht to become an important trade centre in the Northern Netherlands. The growing town Utrecht was granted city rights by Henry V. in 1122.
When the main flow of the Rhine moved south, the old bed, which still flowed through the heart of the town became evermore canalized; and a very rare wharf system was built as an inner city harbour system.[tpl]cite web| title = De Utrechtse Werven|language=Dutch|publisher=Gemeente Utrecht|url=http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=168424|accessdate=2008-01-27[/tpl] On the wharfs storage facilities (werfkelders) were built, on top of which the main street, including houses was constructed. The wharfs and the cellars are accessible from a platform at water level with stairs descending from the street level to form a unique structure.Almost all other canal cities in The Netherlands (such as Amsterdam and Delft) have the water in canals bordering directly to the road surface[tpl]cite web|title=Historic wharf photos from the Utrecht City Archive|publisher=Utrecht City Archive|url=http://www.hetutrechtsarchief.nl/atlantis_treffers.asp?trefwoord=werven|accessdate=2008-01-27[/tpl] The relations between the bishop, who controlled many lands outside of the city, and the citizens of Utrecht was not always easy. The bishop, for example dammed the Kromme Rijn at Wijk bij Duurstede to protect his estates from flooding. This threatened shipping for the city and led the city of Utrecht to commission a canal to ensure access to the town for shipping trade: the Vaartse Rijn, connecting Utrecht to the Hollandse IJssel at IJsselstein.

====The end of independence====

In 1528, the secular powers of the bishop over both Neder- and Oversticht – which included the city of Utrecht – were transferred to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who became the Lord of the Seventeen Provinces (the current Benelux and the northern parts of France). This transition was not an easy one and Charles V tried to exert his power over the citizens of the city, who had achieved a certain level of independence from the bishops and were not willing to cede this to their new lord. Charles decided to build a heavily fortified castle Vredenburg to house a large garrison whose chief task would be to maintain order in the city. The castle would last less than 50 years before it was demolished in an uprising in the early stages of the Dutch Revolt.

===Republic of the Netherlands (1579–1815)===

In 1579 the northern seven provinces signed the Union of Utrecht, in which they decided to join forces against Spanish rule. The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the Dutch Republic. In 1580 the new and predominantly Protestant state abolished the bishoprics, including the one in Utrecht, which had become an archbishopric in 1559. The stadtholders disapproved of the independent course of the Utrecht bourgeoisie and brought the city under much more direct control of the Holland dominated leadership of the republic. This was the start of a long period of stagnation of trade and development in Utrecht, an atypical city in the new state, still about 40% Catholic in the mid-17th century, and even more so among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.[tpl]cite book|author=Wayne Franits|title=Dutch Seventeenth-Century Genre Painting|page=65|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-300-10237-2[/tpl]
The city, which was held against its will in the states of the Republic, failed to defend itself against the French invasion in 1672 (the Disaster Year).
The lack of structural integrity proved to be the undoing of the central section of the cathedral of St Martin church when Utrecht was struck by a tornado in 1674.
The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 settled the War of the Spanish Succession.
Since 1723 (but especially after 1870) Utrecht became the centre of the non-Roman Old Catholic Churches in the world.

===Modern history (1815–present)===

In the early 19th century, the role of Utrecht as a fortified town had become obsolete. The fortifications of the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie were moved east of Utrecht. The town walls could now be demolished to allow for expansion. The moats remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an English style landscape park that remains largely intact today.
Growth of the city increased when, in 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the Dutch railway network.
In 1853, the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by Rome, and Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism once more.
With the industrial revolution finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht began to grow far beyond the medieval center from the 1880s onward with the construction of neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, Wittevrouwen, Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West. New middle class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built in the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, several Jugendstil houses and office buildings were built, followed by Rietveld who built the Rietveld Schröder House (1924), and Dudok's construction of the city theater (1941).
During World War II, Utrecht was held by the Germans until the general German surrender of the Netherlands on 5 May 1945. Canadian troops that surrounded the city entered it after that surrender, on 7 May 1945.
Since World War II, the city has grown considerably when new neighbourhoods such as Overvecht, Kanaleneiland, Hoograven and Lunetten were built. Additionally the area surrounding Utrecht Centraal railway station and the station itself have been developed following modernist ideas of the 1960s, in a brutalist style. This led to the construction of the shopping mall Hoog Catharijne, music centre Vredenburg (Hertzberger, 1979), and conversion of part of the ancient canal structure into a highway (Catherijnebaan). Protest against further modernisation of the city centre followed even before the last buildings were finalised. In the early 21st century the whole area is being redeveloped. An architectural unique music palace has been constructed, that will be run jointly by Vredenburg, Tivoli and the SJU Jazzpodium.
Currently the city is expanding once more with the development of the Leidsche Rijn housing area.[tpl]-[/tpl]

===Topography===

===Climate===

Utrecht experiences a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb) similar to almost all of the Netherlands.

==Demographics==

Inhabitants of Utrecht are called ‘Utrechter’ or more rarely, usually by mistake, ‘Utrechtenaar’ as the latter is also a known Utrecht euphemism for homosexual.The term ‘Utrechtenaar’ has become a profane expression for homosexual after the 1730–31 sodomy trials, and has fallen into disuse since. This distinction, however, is not always known by Dutch speakers from outside the region, who may use the term ‘Utrechtenaar’ without being aware of the specific connotation.
Utrecht city had a population of 296,305 in 2007. Utrecht is a growing municipality and projections are that the city's population will surpass 392,000 by 2025.[tpl]cite web|last=Gemeente Utrecht|title=Utrechts onderzoek en cijfers|url=http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=278616|accessdate=2010-10-15[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
In Utrecht 52% of the population is female, 48% is male. Utrecht has a young population, with many inhabitants in the age category from 20 and 30 years, due to the presence of a large university.
The majority of households (52.5%) in Utrecht are single person households. About 29% of people living in Utrecht are either married, or have another legal partnership. About 3% of the population of Utrecht is divorced.
About 69% of the population is of Dutch ancestry. Approximately 10% of the population consists of immigrants from Western countries, while 21% of the population is of non-Western origin (9% Moroccan, 5% Turkish, 3% Surinamese and Dutch Caribbean and 5% of other countries). With 9% of its population being of Moroccan heritage, Utrecht contains the largest proportion of people of Moroccan descent of any Dutch municipality.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] Many of the city's boroughs have a relatively high percentage of originally non-Dutch inhabitants – i.e. Kanaleneiland 83% and Overvecht 57%.
Like Rotterdam, Amsterdam, The Hague and other large Dutch cities, Utrecht faces socio-economic problems. About 38% percent of its population either earns a minimum income or is dependant on social welfare (17% of all households). Boroughs such as Kanaleneiland, Overvecht and Hoograven consist primarily of high-rise housing developments, and are known for relatively high poverty and crime rate.

===Population centres and agglomeration===

The city of Utrecht consists of 10 official city parts which all have their own neighbourhood council and service center for civil affairs.
Utrecht is the centre of a densely populated area, which makes concise definitions of its agglomeration difficult, and somewhat arbitrary. The smaller Utrecht agglomeration counts some 420,000 inhabitants and includes Nieuwegein, IJsselstein and Maarssen. It is sometimes argued that the municipalities De Bilt, Zeist, Houten, Vianen, Driebergen-Rijsenburg (Utrechtse Heuvelrug), and Bunnik should also be counted towards the Utrecht agglomeration, bringing the total to 640,000 inhabitants. The larger region, including slightly more remote towns such as Woerden and Amersfoort counts up to 820,000 inhabitants.[tpl]cite web|author=CBS Statline|title=Gemiddelde bevolking per regio naar leeftijd en geslacht / Gebieden in Nederland 2007|year=2007|url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/start.asp?KEYWORDS=agglomeratie+utrecht&BOOL=0&LA=NL&DM=SLNL&lp=Search/SResults|accessdate =2008-01-05[/tpl]

==Cityscape==

Utrecht's cityscape features the Dom Tower, belonging to the former cathedral (Dom Church).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.domtoren.nl/ |title=RonDom |publisher=Domtoren.nl |accessdate=2011-04-13[/tpl] An ongoing debate is if any building in or near the centre of town may surpass the Dom Tower in height (112 m). Nevertheless, some tall buildings are now being constructed that will become part of the skyline of Utrecht. The second highest building of the city, the Rabobank-tower, completed in 2010 and standing [tpl]Convert|105|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl] tall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rabobankgroep.nl/asp/default.asp?node_id=15062&version_id=1|title=Rabobank Groep|publisher=Rabobankgroep.nl|accessdate=2011-04-13[/tpl] Two antennas will increase that height to [tpl]Convert|120|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl]. Two other buildings were constructed around the Nieuw Galgenwaard stadium (2007). These buildings, the 'Kantoortoren Galghenwert' and 'Apollo Residence', stand 85.5 and 64.5 metres high respectively.
Another landmark is the old centre and the canal structure in the inner city. The Oudegracht is a curved canal, partly following an old arm of the Rhine. It is lined with the unique wharf-basement structures that create a two-level street along the canals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=168424|title=Cultuurhistorie en Monumenten|publisher=Utrecht.nl|date=1993-12-04|accessdate=2011-04-13[/tpl] The inner city has largely retained its Medieval structure,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=90241|title=Wijksite Binnenstad|publisher=Utrecht.nl|date=2011-03-30|accessdate=2011-04-13[/tpl] and the moat ringing the old town is largely intact.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.map21ltd.com/COSTC11/Utrecht/Utrecht.htm|publisher=Map21ltd.com|accessdate=2011-04-13|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Because of the role of Utrecht as a fortified city, which restricted construction outside the walls, until the 19th century the city has remained very compact.
