==Biography==

John was a native of Rossano in Calabria.[tpl]cite book |author= Hare, Augustus J. C. |title=Cities of Southern Italy and Sicily |publisher=READ BOOKS  |year=2007 |pages=344–345 |isbn=9781406782127 |quote= Pope John VII. (705–707) was a native of Rossano. [/tpl] His father, Plato (c. 620 – 686), was imperial cura palatii urbis Romae, or curator of the Palatine Hill. This makes John the first pope to be the son of a Byzantine official.Kelly, J. N. D. The Oxford Dictionary of Popes. Oxford University Press, 1986, p. 84. His mother was called Blatta (c. 627 – 687). His paternal grandfather was Theodorus Chilas (c. 600 – aft. 655), a Senator in 655.Bernd Josef Jansen Genealogy. RootsWeb.com.
John VII had good relations with the Lombards, who then ruled much of  Italy. However, his relations with Justinian II, the Byzantine Emperor, were far from smooth. Papal relations with Byzantium had soured over the Quinisext (or Trullan) council of 692. Scholarly debate contests John VII's stance on the Canons.Breckenridge, J. D. "Evidence for the Nature of Relations between Pope John VII and the Byzantine Emperor Justinian II". Byzantinische Zeitschrift, Vol. 65, 1972.Nordhagen, P. J. "Constantinople on the Tiber".Smith, J. M. H. (ed.). Early Medieval Rome and the Christian West. Leiden, 2000. He did not ratify the Canons, which were deeply unpopular in Italy. Nonetheless, he was criticized, most unusually, by the Liber Pontificalis for not signing them:
 He Justinian II despatched two metropolitan bishops, also sending with them a mandate in which he requested and urged the pontiff VII to gather a council of the apostolic church, and to confirm such of them as he approved, and quash and reject those which were adverse. But he, terrified in his human weakness, sent them back to the prince by the same metropolitans without any emendations at all.Davis, R. The Book of Pontiffs: the ancient biographies of the first ninety Roman bishops to AD 715. Liverpool University Press, 2000, p. 91.
 
Several monuments in Rome are connected with John. The most notable is the Church of St. Maria Antiqua at the foot of the Palatine Hill. Traces of an episcopal palace Episcopium associated with John have been discovered upon the Palatine.Augenti, A. Il Palatino nel Medioevo. Roma, 1996. John VII also constructed an Oratory dedicated to the Theotokos. The Oratory was located within the Old basilica of St. Peter. Fragments of the mosaic decoration can be found in the Vatican grottoes. Furthermore, a sizeable icon, known as the Madonna della Clemenza and housed in Santa Maria in Trastevere, is believed to have been commissioned under the patronage of John.Nordhagen, J. P. "Icons designed for the display of sumptuous votive gifts". Dumbarton Oaks Papers, Vol. 41, 1988. He also restored the monastery of Subiaco, destroyed by the Lombards in 601.
John VII died 18 October, 707 and was buried in the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary which had been added on to St. Peter's.Richard P. McBrien, Lives of the Popes, (HarperCollins, 1997), 117. He was succeeded by Sisinnius.
