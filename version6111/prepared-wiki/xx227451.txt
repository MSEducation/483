[[Club Life (TV series)]]

CATEGORIES: City (TV network) shows

Club Life is a series developed by Producer Jamie Hall, and is broadcast on citytv for Canada.  Club Life premiered on June 7, 2008 with season 2 expected to air Nationally in June 2010.  Season one was filmed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.
The show is about, as the title suggests, life in the night clubs.  The first season focused on club etiquette.  Topics ranged from fashion and drunk indicators to "How to be a VIP" and "How to treat a bartender".  The show was a ratings success which has led to Season two which will be shot in Las Vegas and will help Canadians navigate Las Vegas nightlife.

==Production==

Originally, Club Life was supposed to be a small segment presentation on the cable network Shaw TV.  The management at Shaw decided that Club Life would force them to change the formula of their programming around Club Life so nixed the idea.  In 2007, Jamie Hall approached Citytv Winnipeg about a half hour program.  It was decided that Club Life would be more risque than originally developed and would centralize around sexually charged etiquette as well as humorous and sometimes embarrassing moments in night clubs. This was never more prevalent than in the Season one recap episode http://crackle.com/c/Reality/Club_Life_Season_1_Episode_8/2363164#ml=fi%3d%26fu%3d2386864.
Hall assembled a team which included his assistant Kayla Tremblay and camera man his Shaw series, Def 11 which aired years earlier named Mitch Olsen.  The team concluded that the show would feature one club per episode and would be developed around segments which included girls and guys questions as well as pickup lines.
Hall knew there was a challenge with such a show.  The challenge was getting people to actually watch it http://www.yournightyourcity.com/archives/307.  This is why the show was accompanied by events and a massive online campaign featuring many previews on YouTube, crackle and Facebook.  The show began production in May with Tila Tequila being featured on the series premiere http://www.accesswinnipeg.com/2008/06/tila-tequila-interview-on-club-life-canada.

The behind the scenes special was taped at Teleco, a Rogers Wireless sales location.  All shooting was on location.  In season two producers have said they will be doing some green screen studio work and segway shots on location as well as outside of the clubs.

==Cast==

Jamie Hall, who produces Club Life is also the host of the show and is sometimes known on-air as JamCo.  His onscreen presence is meant to be noninvasive and unassuming.  He doesn't get particularly sexual with guests and maintains a happy demeanor.
Bettina Pogson is the newest addition to the cast as co-host.  You will often see Mitch Olsen panning down her sexy outfits.  Bettina is new to TV but already feels natural in front of the camera.
Mandy Hogaboam plays the role of the sexy Production Assistant.  She is the back bone of the behind the scenes production and is usually responsible for the guests that are on air.
Mitch Olsen, also known as Mitch The-Camera Olsen plays the over the top and crazy camera guy who often gets drunk and grabs the "special bits" of guests.  His tone is sexual but at the same time humorous.  In episode 5 of Season 1, Mitch became a camera regular with his segment "The Mitch Slap" that took a blunt look at what was happening in the club that night.
