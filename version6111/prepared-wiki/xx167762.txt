==History==

The Bernals were an old family from the days of colonial Buenos Aires. In the mid-19th century, a descendant of the family, Don Pedro Bernal, established a farm in the Partido of Quilmes, and built a house on that site. In 1850, he divided the land up into smaller farms which were then settled by other prominent families, such as the Molina Salas, Ayersa, Tasso, and Bagley. 1850 is deemed as the official foundation year of the City of Bernal.

==Population==

In 2001, Bernal had with 109,790 inhabitants (INDEC, 2001) the second largest population in the Partido of Quilmes, roughly 25% of the total partido population : 76,499 in West Bernal, 33,415 in East Bernal. These numbers imply a population growth of 15% compared with the figures of the 1991 INDEC Census which had shown a population of 111,361 inhabitants.
