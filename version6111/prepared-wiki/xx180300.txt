===Louisiana caucuses===

Caucus date: January 22, 2008 
National delegates: 0 (see note below)
The Louisiana caucus is not considered an official race and all the state delegates chosen during the caucuses are nationally uncommitted, but they could run on one or multiple slates. Louisiana chooses 20 national delegates plus 3 PLEO delegates during the state convention on February 16, 2008. All the delegates elected at the state convention are officially considered uncommitted due to state party rules, but the delegation of John McCain is having the majority at the state convention since he won the majority of delegates in the districts 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. So it is very likely that all 20 + 3 delegates will support John McCain.
The official results have not been released, and some media have reported that John McCain won, that Ron Paul took second, and that Mitt Romney took a distant third.[tpl]cite news |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/01/paul-alleges-bo.html |title=Political Radar: Paul Alleges Boondoggle on the Bayou |accessdate=2008-01-28 |date=2008-01-24 |publisher=ABC News[/tpl] A slate of uncommitted delegates running on a pro-life platform was the overall winner.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lagop.com/ |title=LAGOP Releases Unofficial Results of Louisiana's Republican Caucus |accessdate=2008-01-24 |date=2008-01-24 |publisher=Republican Party of Louisiana[/tpl]
