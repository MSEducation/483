John Edward McGee, Jr. (born October 19, 1969), known professionally as John Edward, is an American television personality and professional psychic medium. He is best known for his TV shows Crossing Over with John Edward and John Edward Cross Country.
Born in Glen Cove, New York, Edward says he was convinced at a young age that he could become a psychic. After writing his first book on the subject in 1998, Edward became a well-known and controversial figure in the United States through his shows broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel beginning in July 2000 and We TV since May 2006.

==Biography==

The only son of an Irish-American police officer and an Italian-American working mother,[tpl]cite book |last=Edward |first=John |title=After Life |year=2003 |publisher=Princess Books |isbn=1-932128-12-3 [/tpl] Edward was raised Roman Catholic. Although Edward later stopped practicing that faith, he has said he never stopped feeling connected to God and is still closely connected to his Catholic roots.[tpl]cite book |last=Edward |first=John |year=1998 |title=One Last Time |publisher=Berkley Trade |isbn=0-425-16908-1 [/tpl] Edward once said, "This is something that is driven by a belief in God. It's the energy from that force that I think allows us to create this energy."[tpl]cite book |last=Edward |first=John |year=2001 |title=Crossing Over |publisher=Jodere Group |isbn=1-58872-002-0 |page=21 [/tpl]
According to Edward, when he was 15 and "a huge doubter" (in psychic abilities), he was "read" by a New Jersey woman who convinced him that he could become a medium.[tpl]cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030220161519/http://www.nytix.com/TVShows/NewYork/JohnEdward/transcripts/ |archivedate=February 20, 2003|title=John Edward: An Alleged Psychic Who Claims to Communicate With the Dead|url=http://www.nytix.com/TVShows/NewYork/JohnEdward/transcripts/  |series=Larry King Live |network=CNN |airdate=1998-06-19|deadurl=yes [/tpl]
 
 "She told me things that there is no way she could have known. And the first part of the reading was that this was the path that I was supposed to be on and that I was supposed to be a teacher and help people and – I thought she was nuts." Speaking of the same encounter in a 2002 interview, Edward said, "She told me I would one day become internationally known for my psychic abilities through lectures, books, radio and TV. I thought she was full of it until she started to tell me things no one in my life knew about... The details were unbelievable."[tpl]cite news |first=Lisa |last=Ling |authorlink=Lisa Ling |title=Connecting With the Dead |url=http://www.usaweekend.com/02_issues/021013/021013john_edward.html |work=USA WEEKEND |publisher=Gannett Company |date=October 13, 2002 |accessdate=December 22, 2006 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

Later, Edward worked as a phlebotomist while pursuing a degree in health care administration at Long Island University.[tpl]cite episode |title=Interview With John Edward |series=Larry King Live |network=CNN |airdate=2003-10-02 [/tpl] He met his wife, Sandra McGee, when he was a student in a dance studio, and he became a ballroom dancing instructor before entering his current field of work. He and his wife had their first child, Justin, on September 25, 2002, and their second child, Olivia, on January 25, 2007.

==Television shows==

Edward published his first book, One Last Time, in 1998. His related appearance on Larry King Live later in the year prompted enough phone calls to overload the show's switchboard.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/johnedward/aboutjohn/ |title=About John |work=Crossing Over with John Edward |publisher=Sci Fi Channel |accessdate=January 11, 2007 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061202021635/http://www.scifi.com/johnedward/aboutjohn/| archivedate = December 2, 2006[/tpl] The next year, Edward had a show of his own.

===Crossing Over with John Edward===

From 1999 to 2004, Edward was the producer and host of the show Crossing Over with John Edward, which has been syndicated and was broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States and on Living TV in the UK. In Crossing Over, Edward gave readings to audience members.[tpl]cite video |people=Edward, John |title=Crossing Over with John Edward |medium=Television series |publisher=Sci-Fi Channel |location=U.S. |year=1999 [/tpl]

====Show format====

Readings in Crossing Over involve Edward questioning audience members with what is presented as information being communicated by their deceased friends and relatives. Edward says he receives images and clues from "the other side" which the audience must assist him in interpreting. The audience is not supposed to supply Edward with any prior information about themselves, their family or whom they are trying to connect with "on the other side", aside from questionnaires filled out prior to taping. Audience members respond to Edward's statements and questions, adding any details they feel are appropriate. The show often employs a split screen, the view of a reading without sound on one half of the screen while on the other half the subjects of the reading are shown in a later interview as they discuss their experiences. A voiceover by Edward is also implemented at times, sharing further insights and inspirational messages.
In other instances, Edward conducted private sessions away from the studio audience. The subjects of these segments later talked in greater detail about the situation that led to their reading with Edward and the effect the reading had on their lives. Periodically, segments revisit people who have previously appeared on the show.

===John Edward Cross Country===

Edward's current show, John Edward Cross Country, has been broadcast on We TV, since March 2006. In this forum, the audience is not supposed to supply Edward with any prior information about themselves, their family or whom they are trying to connect with "on the other side."[tpl]cite video |people=Edward, John |year=2006 |title=John Edward Cross Country |url=http://www.we.tv/article?CID=key%3D668%26tzOffset%3D0 |medium=Television series |publisher=Women's Entertainment [/tpl] According to Edward, he simply "lets his guides draw him to the people that spirits are trying to connect with, and the audience should only validate the information he gives them".  In each episode, after a reading Edward is filmed visiting the person or people whose reading was televised, along with their families, to see how the experience had changed their lives.John Edward Is One Psyched Psychic – Today's News: Our Take.

==Criticism and controversy==

Critics of Edward assert he performs the mentalist techniques of hot reading and cold reading, in which one respectively uses prior knowledge or a wide array of quick and sometimes general guesses to create the impression of psychic ability.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theness.com/articles.asp?id=49 |title=Medium Dead |accessdate=December 12, 2006 |last=Blumenfeld |first=Jon |date= July 21, 2000 |publisher=New England Skeptical Society| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061111120717/http://www.theness.com/articles.asp?id=49| archivedate = November 11, 2006[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=July 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.skepticreport.com/psychicpowers/jeblues.htm |title=Talking the John Edward Blues |accessdate=December 12, 2006 |last=Endersby |first=Andrew |date=December 2002 |publisher=SkepticReport |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070103100811/http://www.skepticreport.com/psychicpowers/jeblues.htm  |archivedate = January 3, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/tv/reviews/c/crossing-over.shtml |title=Crossing Over with John Edward |accessdate=December 12, 2006 |last=O'Dell |first=Cary |work=Television Reviews |publisher=PopMatters [/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=Talking to the Dead | url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/jaroff/article/0,9565,100555,00.html |work=Time Magazine |author= Leon Jaroff | accessdate=June 14, 2006 | date=February 25, 2001[/tpl] Choosing the first reading from a two hour tape of edited shows as a sample, magician and skeptic James Randi found that just three of 23 statements made by Edward were confirmed as correct by the audience member being read, and the three statements that were correct were also trivial and nondescript.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-04/042106edward.html#i1| title=John Edward Revisited |work=Swift |last=Randi |first=James |date=April 21, 2006 |accessdate=December 11, 2006 |authorlink=James Randi |publisher=James Randi Educational Foundation [/tpl] In another incident, Edward was said to have used foreknowledge to hot read in an interview on the television show Dateline.[tpl]cite journal |last=Nickell |first=Joe |date=November–December 2001 |title=John Edward: Hustling the Bereaved |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=25 |issue=6 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2001-11/i-files.html |accessdate=December 13, 2006 [/tpl] James Underdown of the Independent Investigative Group (IIG) attended a Crossing Over show in November 2002 and said "there were no indications of anyone I saw collecting information... none of his readings contained the kind of specific information that would raise an eyebrow of suspicion. ... John Edward was a bad cold reader. He, too, struggled to get hits, and in one attempt shot off nearly 40 guesses before finding any significant targets."[tpl]cite journal |last=Underdown |first=James |date=September–October 2003 |title=They See Dead People – Or Do They? |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=27 |issue=5 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/they_see_dead_people_-_or_do_they_an_investigation_of_television_mediums/ |accessdate=December 11, 2006 [/tpl]
Another criticism has been that Edward's apparent accuracy on television may be inflated by the editing process. After watching the broadcast version of the show he had attended and recorded, Underdown attributed a great deal of Edward's accuracy on television to editing and wrote, "Edward's editor fine-tuned many of the dead-ends out of a reading riddled with misses." In 2002, Edward said, "People are in the studio for eight hours, and we have to edit the show for time, not content. We don't try to hide the 'misses'."
Edward has denied ever using hot or cold reading techniques.[tpl]cite book | last = Edward | first = John | year = 2001 | title = Crossing Over | publisher = Jodere Group| isbn = 1-58872-002-0[/tpl]

===Paranormal study===

Gary Schwartz, a psychologist and researcher in the controversial field of parapsychology, designed and administered a series of tests for Edward and several other mediums to investigate their paranormal claims and published his belief that Edward's abilities were genuine in his book The Afterlife Experiments.[tpl]cite book |last=Schwartz |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Schwartz |title=The Afterlife Experiments |publisher=Atria Books |date=March 2003 |isbn=978-0-7434-3659-5 [/tpl]  The study did not undergo scientific peer review, and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry's Ray Hyman, a psychologist and noted critic of parapsychology, wrote a detailed critique of Schwartz's methodology and conclusions in a 2003 issue of the Skeptical Inquirer.[tpl]cite journal |last=Hyman |first=Ray |authorlink=Ray Hyman |date=January–February 2003 |title=How Not to Test Mediums |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=27 |issue=1 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/how_not_to_test_mediums_critiquing_the_afterlife_experiments/ [/tpl] Schwartz responded to the critique,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/how_not_to_review_mediumship_research/ |title=How Not To Review Mediumship Research |accessdate=December 4, 2006 |last=Schwartz |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Schwartz |year=2003 [/tpl] leading Hyman to write a rebuttal.[tpl]cite journal |last=Hyman |first=Ray |authorlink=Ray Hyman |date=May–June 2003 |title=Follow Up Reply |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=27 |issue=3 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/hymans_reply_to_schwartz/ |accessdate=December 4, 2006 [/tpl]

===9/11===

Shortly after the September 11 attacks, Edward began filming at least one special in which he met with some relatives of the victims, with the intention of communicating with those who were killed. According to Edward's autobiography, he did not know that the producers had chosen the victims' families to appear on the show. The trade magazine Broadcasting & Cable sent a story, "'Psychic' Plans WTC Victims Show", on the daily subscription-fax sent to news media and TV-station executives on October 25, 2001. Steve Rosenberg, president of domestic television at Studios USA, the company that distributes Edward's program, had tentatively scheduled the program(s) to be broadcast during the November sweeps period, but news of the taping sparked a national outcry. Both the Sci Fi Channel and the Crossing Over with John Edward production office were flooded with phone calls and e-mails, some expressing outrage at the exploitation of the national tragedy, others at what they perceived as extreme tastelessness in search of ratings. Rosenberg initially ignored the criticism, insisting the programming would go on as scheduled, but within hours he terminated his plans.[tpl]cite news |last= de Moraes |first= Lisa |title= Medium Crosses The Line: WTC Segment Canned |work=The Washington Post |date= October 26, 2006 |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A53372-2001Oct25 |accessdate=December 18, 2006 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |date=January–February 2002 |title=John Edward's televised tragedy seance scrapped |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=26 |issue=1 |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071015132341/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_1_26/ai_80924575 |accessdate=December 18, 2006 [/tpl]
