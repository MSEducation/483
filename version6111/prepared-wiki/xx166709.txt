==Biography==

Peyveste Emukhvari was born as a daughter of Prince Osman Bey Emukhvari and Princess Hesna Çaabalurhva. She had green eyes and long brunette hair for much of her life. In 1877, during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), her family emigrated from the Caucasus to Istanbul, where she was delivered at the court of the Ottoman Sultan. First, she was given to serve the head of the court. However, soon the Sultan Abdul Hamid II took notice of Peyveste, and they married on 24 January 1893 in the Yıldız Palace, the Sultan's residence at the time.
One year later, upon the birth of their son, Abdul Hamid II ordered the building of a small palace for his young wife. However, Peyveste had not succeeded in binding the sultan to her, and already in 1896, Abdul Hamid II had moved to another young princess. Soon, he made his new favorite Fatma Pesend Hanım his 11th wife. Peyveste, disappointed in her husband, retreated from the court life and dedicated herself to the upbringing of her son. During the 1908 Young Turk Revolution that overthrew her husband's autocratic rule and restored constitutional monarchy, Peyveste, who already was raised to a rank of a great duchess, followed her husband in exile. One year later, she returned to Istanbul with her son. In 1924, she went into a second exile and lived with her son first in Naples and Rome, and later in Paris, where she died in 1944. The great duchess Peyveste was buried in the Muslim Bobigny cemetery in Paris.
