==History==

Lang Lang pioneer Alfred Turner Priestley brought his family to Carrum for a holiday in 1913, and in 1918 he bought [tpl]convert|170|acre|km2[/tpl] of pastoral land north and west of the Patterson River, operating a dairy farm from its northern side. In 1966 the Priestley family after gaining relevant approval were instrumental in establishing a dry dock marina. The first man made marina in the Southern Hemisphere was formed, and in 1988 the farm along with the marina were sold to make way for the new suburb of Patterson Lakes.https://sites.google.com/site/originalcarrumcowboys/the-jones-family/the-original-carrum-cowboys/the-priestleys Having originally been named Whaler's Cove Marina the marina was later renamed Patterson Lakes Marina.

===Hardstand===

Patterson Lakes Marina has hardstand areas which accommodate boats up to 60 feet in length. The hardstand is serviced by a travel lift, with a lifting capacity of 25 tons. The travel lift pulls a vessel out of the water and moves it to a hardstand berth or to one of the factories, for boat maintenance and anti-fouling. The hardstand is situated near the new purpose built factories, which cover all facets of the marine service industry: mechanical services, complete boat maintenance, and other services.
