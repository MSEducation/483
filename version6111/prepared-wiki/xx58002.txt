Sunderland ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Sunderland.ogg|ˈ|s|ʌ|n|d|ər|l|ən|d[/tpl], [tpl]IPAc-en|local|ˈ|s|ʊ|n|ᵈ|l|ən[/tpl]) is a city which lies at the heart of the City of Sunderland metropolitan borough, a part of Tyne and Wear, in North East England. It is situated at the mouth of the River Wear.
Historically a part of County Durham, there were three original settlements on the site of modern-day Sunderland. On the north side of the river, Monkwearmouth was settled in 674 when Benedict Biscop founded the Wearmouth-Jarrow monastery. Opposite the monastery on the south bank, Bishopwearmouth was founded in 930. A small fishing village called Sunderland, located toward the mouth of the river (modern day East End) was granted a charter in 1179.
Over the centuries, Sunderland grew as a port, trading coal and salt. Ships began to be built on the river in the 14th century. By the 19th century, the port of Sunderland had grown to absorb Bishopwearmouth and Monkwearmouth.
A person who is born or lives around the Sunderland area is sometimes colloquially known as a Mackem.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wear/content/articles/2005/06/21/wordhunt_feature.shtml|title=The Mackem Wordhunt|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=BBC|year=2005[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/18/messages/814.html Mackems|title=The word Mackem origins|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=Phrases.org website|year=2005[/tpl]

==History==

===Early history===

The earliest inhabitants of the Sunderland area were Stone Age hunter-gatherers and artifacts from this era have been discovered, including microliths found during excavations at St Peter's Church, Monkwearmouth.[tpl]cite book |title=A History of Sunderland |edition=2nd |year=2001 |isbn=0-9525122-6-2 |author=Glen Lyndon Dodds |page=5[/tpl] During the final phase of the Stone Age, the Neolithic period (c.4,000-c.2,000 BC), Hastings Hill, on the western outskirts of Sunderland, was a focal point of activity and a place of burial and ritual significance. Evidence includes the former presence of a cursus monument.[tpl]cite book |title=A History of Sunderland |edition=2nd |year=2001 |isbn=0-9525122-6-2 |author=Glen Lyndon Dodds |page=6[/tpl] It is believed the Brigantes inhabited the area around the River Wear in the pre- and post-Roman era. There is a long-standing local legend that there was a Roman settlement on the south bank of the River Wear on what is the site of the former Vaux Brewery, although no archaeological investigation has taken place.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/3200659.stm|title=Brewery may hold Roman answers|accessdate=2009-07-22 |publisher=BBC News|date=2003-09-02[/tpl]
Recorded settlements at the mouth of the Wear date to 674, when an Anglo-Saxon nobleman, Benedict Biscop, granted land by King Ecgfrith of Northumbria, founded the Wearmouth-Jarrow (St. Peter's) monastery on the north bank of the river – an area that became known as Monkwearmouth. Biscop's monastery was the first built of stone in Northumbria. He employed glaziers from France and in doing so he re-established glass making in Britain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/CustomPages/CustomPage.aspx?PageID=31748|title=Museum and Winter Gardens – Look At Glass|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=Sunderland Echo|year=2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080513072206/http://www.sunderlandecho.com/CustomPages/CustomPage.aspx?PageID=31748  |archivedate = 2008-05-13[/tpl]
In 686 the community was taken over by Ceolfrid, and Wearmouth-Jarrow became a major centre of learning and knowledge in Anglo-Saxon England with a library of around 300 volumes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weardaleway.wanadoo.co.uk/history1.html|title=Sunderland History|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=Weardaleway website|year=2005[/tpl]

In the late 8th century, the Vikings raided the coast, and by the middle of the 9th century, the monastery had been abandoned. Lands on the south side of the river were granted to the Bishop of Durham by Athelstan of England in 930; these became known as Bishopwearmouth and included settlements such as Ryhope which fall within the modern boundary of Sunderland.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/public/editable/themes/environment/implementation/conservation/conservationwalks/bishopwearmouth/bishop.origins.asp |title=Origins of Bishopwearmouth |accessdate=2007-01-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927201702/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/public/editable/themes/environment/implementation/conservation/conservationwalks/bishopwearmouth/bishop.origins.asp  |archivedate = 2007-09-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wearsideonline.com/ryhope_village.html|title=Ryhope Village|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=Wearsideonline website|year=2008[/tpl]

As the water evaporated the salt remained. This process, known as salt panning, gave its name to Bishopwearmouth Panns; the modern-day name of the area the pans occupied is Pann's Bank, on the river bank between the city centre and Hendon. As coal was required to heat the salt pans, a coal mining community began to emerge. Only poor quality coal was used in salt panning; quality coal was traded via the port, which subsequently began to grow.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northeasthistory.co.uk/the_north_east/history/coal/1100_1500/index.html|title=North East History, Early Coal Mining|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=The Northern Echo newspaper|year=2003[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===17th and 18th centuries===

Before the English Civil War in 1642, King Charles I bestowed the rights to the East of England coal trade on Newcastle. This had a big impact on Sunderland, which had begun to grow as a coal-trading town. It created resentment toward Newcastle and the monarchy. In March 1644, a Scottish army allied to the king's enemies was stationed at Sunderland and clashes occurred in the vicinity with Royalist troops under the Marquess of Newcastle who moved against them. The most significant encounter occurred in the Hylton and Boldon areas.[tpl]cite news |title=A History of Sunderland (second edition, 2001), Glen Lyndon Dodds, pp. 46–48[/tpl] Parliament blockaded the River Tyne, crippling the Newcastle coal trade which allowed the Sunderland coal trade to flourish. Because of the difficulty for colliers trying to navigate the shallow waters of the  Wear, the coal was loaded onto keels (large boats) and taken downriver to the waiting colliers. The keels were manned by a close-knit group of workers known as 'keelmen'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northeasthistory.co.uk/the_north_east/history/didyouknow/12.html|title=Did you know?|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=North East History website|year=2003[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In 1719, the parish of Sunderland was carved from the densely populated east end of Bishopwearmouth by the establishment of a new parish church, Holy Trinity Church, Sunderland (today also known as Sunderland Old Parish Church). The three original settlements  Wearmouth (Bishopwearmouth, Monkwearmouth and Sunderland) had begun to combine, driven by the success of the port of Sunderland and salt panning and shipbuilding along the banks of the river. Around this time, Sunderland was known as 'Sunderland-near-the-Sea'.[tpl]cite web |last=Shegog |first=Eric |url=http://www2.citysun.ac.uk/minster/history.htm |title=Sunderland Minster |publisher=City of Sunderland College |accessdate=2006-12-09[/tpl]

===19th century===

Local government was divided between the three parishes (Holy Trinity Church, Sunderland, St. Michael's, Bishopwearmouth, and St. Peter's, Monkwearmouth) and when cholera broke out in 1831, the "select vestrymen", as the church councilmen were called, were unable to cope with the epidemic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/longview/longview_20030415.shtml|title=BBC Diary of an Epidemic|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=BBC website|year=2003[/tpl] Sunderland, a main trading port at the time, was the first British town to be struck with the 'Indian cholera' epidemic.Diary of an Epidemic (Cholera), BBC Radio 4, http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/longview/longview_20030415.shtml The first victim, William Sproat, died on 23 October 1831. Sunderland was put into quarantine, and the port was blockaded, but in December of that year the disease spread to Gateshead and from there, it rapidly made its way across the country, killing an estimated 32,000 people. Among those to die was Sunderland's Naval hero Jack Crawford.

The Wearmouth Bridge was built in 1796, at the instigation of Rowland Burdon, the Member of Parliament for County Durham, and is described by Nikolaus Pevsner as being of superb elegance.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] It was the second iron bridge built after the famous span at Ironbridge, but over twice as long and only three-quarters the weight.

===20th century to present===

As the former heavy industries have declined, so electronic, chemical, paper and motor manufactures have replaced them, including the city's Nissan car plant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/daily/A-good-little-runner-.1616180.jp|title=A Good Little Runner|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=Kevin Clark|year=2006[/tpl]
At the beginning of the 20th century some 146,000 people were living in Sunderland. [tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] The public transport network was enhanced in 1900 with an electric tram system. The trams were gradually replaced by buses during the 1940s before being completely axed in 1954. [tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Education in Sunderland was improved in 1901 with the opening of the town's Technical College. [tpl]Cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] A big improvement to healthcare came in 1929 when the town's General Hospital opened. Several public parks were opened in Sunderland during the first four decades of the 20th century, including Barnes Park in 1909, Backhouse Park in 1923 and Thompson Park in 1933. Housing conditions in the town began to improve in the 1920s and 1930s when new council estates were developed in the suburbs to rehouse families from town centre slums. [tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] New homes for private sale were built as well.
With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Sunderland was a key target of the German Luftwaffe, who claimed the lives of 267 people [tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] in the town, caused damage or destruction to 4,000 homes, and devastated local industry. After the war, more housing was developed. The town's boundaries expanded in 1967 when neighbouring Ryhope, Silksworth, Herrington, South Hylton and Castletown were incorporated into Sunderland.
The 1970s saw the completion of a new town hall, civic centre, police station and general hospital. [tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl] With more and more of the old Sunderland disappearing, attempts were made to preserve some of the town's historic past, and Monkwearmouth Station Museum opened in 1973 and the North East Aircraft Museum opened a year later.
Sunderland had suffered from unemployment during the Great Depression of the early 1930s, but improved over the subsequent decades as new industries sprang up. Jobs were readily available in skilled trades and this played a role in the continuing rebuilding of the town. [tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl]
During the second half of the 20th century shipbuilding and coalmining declined; shipbuilding ended in 1988 and coalmining in 1993. At the worst of the unemployment crisis up to 20% of the local workforce were unemployed in the mid-1980s.http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=U4JWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NEENAAAAIBAJ&pg=1235,602714&dq=britain+million+unemployment&hl=en
Some new industries developed in the area at this time, and the service sector expanded during the 1980s and 1990s. In July 1986, Sunderland became home to a car factory owned by Japanese carmaker Nissan – the first European factory to be built by a Japanese carmaker. [tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] 
From 1990, the banks of the Wear were regenerated with the creation of housing, retail parks and business centres on former shipbuilding sites. Alongside the creation of the National Glass Centre the University of Sunderland has built a new campus on the St. Peter's site. The clearance of the Vaux Breweries site on the north west fringe of the city centre created a further opportunity for development in the city centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/Centre-will-be-a-glass.817088.jp|title=Centre will be a glass act again|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=Laura White|year=2004[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/Sir-Tom-gets-own-campus.598289.jp|title=Sir Tom gets own campus!|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=Sunderland Echo website|year=2002[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/HAVE-YOUR-SAY-ON-VAUX.589897.jp|title=Have your say on Vaux site|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=Sunderland Echo website|year=2003[/tpl]
Sunderland received city status in 1992.A Brief History of Sunderland
The 20th century saw Sunderland A.F.C. established as the Wearside area's greatest claim to sporting fame. Founded in 1879 as Sunderland and District Teachers A.F.C. by schoolmaster James Allan, Sunderland joined The Football League for the 1890–91 season. By 1936 the club had been league champions on five occasions. They won their first FA Cup in 1937, but their only post-World War II major honour came in 1973 when they won a second FA Cup. They have had a checkered history and dropped into the old third division for a season and been relegated thrice from the Premier League, twice  with the lowest points ever,Sunderland | The Club | History earning the club a reputation as a yo-yo club. After 99 years at the historic Roker Park stadium,Sunderland | Roker Park the club moved to the 42,000-seat Stadium of Light on the banks of the River Wear in 1997. At the time, it was the largest stadium built by an English football club since the 1920s, and has since been expanded to hold nearly 50,000 seated spectators.Sunderland | Stadium of Light
Like many cities, Sunderland comprises a number of areas with their own distinct histories, Fulwell, Monkwearmouth, Roker, and Southwick on the northern side of the Wear, and Bishopwearmouth and Hendon to the south.

==Governance==

Sunderland was created a municipal borough of County Durham in 1835. Under the Local Government Act 1888, it was given the status of a County Borough, independence from county council control. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the county borough was abolished and its area combined with that of other districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Sunderland in Tyne and Wear. The metropolitan borough was granted city status after winning a competition in 1992 to celebrate the Queen's 40th year on the throne.
Sunderland has the motto of Nil Desperandum Auspice Deo loosely translated it means Never Despair, Trust In God.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/pages/Press/pritem.asp?Id=10190|title=STILL TIME TO SEE SUNDERLAND SHINE|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author=Sunderland Council website|year=2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Geography==

Much of the city is located on a low range of hills running parallel to the coast. On average, it is around 80 metres above sea level. Sunderland is divided by the River Wear which passes through the middle of the city in a deeply incised valley, part of which is known as the Hylton gorge. The two road bridges connecting the north and south portions of the city are the Queen Alexandra Bridge at Pallion and the Wearmouth Bridge just to the north of the city centre. A third bridge carries the A19 dual-carriageway over the Wear to the west of the city (see map below).
Most of the suburbs of Sunderland are situated towards the west of the city centre with 70% of its population living on the south side of the river and 30% on the north side. The city extends to the seafront at Hendon and Ryhope in the south and Seaburn in the north.

===Suburbs===

Some, mainly local authority-built, Sunderland suburbs have most streets beginning with the same letter:
In Marley Pots, the streets are all associated with trees, e.g. Maplewood, Elmwood etc.
In Millfield, the streets are all associated with plants, e.g. Chester, Fern, Rose, Hyacinth etc.

==Demography==

Sunderland is the 13th largest city in England. At 3,874 hectares, Sunderland is the 45th largest urban area in England by measure of area, with a population density of 45.88 people per hectare.
According to statistics[tpl]cite web|title=Sunderland 2001 Census Statistics|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Public/Editable/Themes/theCity/Key-Statistics-Environment/Census/dfc-sunderland.pdf|accessdate=2007-01-18|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070711002534/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Public/Editable/Themes/theCity/Key-Statistics-Environment/Census/dfc-sunderland.pdf  |archivedate = 2007-07-11[/tpl] based on the 2001 census, 60% of homes in the Sunderland metropolitan area are owner occupied, with an average household size of 2.4 people. Three percent of the homes have no permanent residents.
66% (men) and 54.7% (women) of the population within working age are economically active. 6.7% of men and 3% of women are unemployed. 12.2% of men and 8.6% women are permanently sick or disabled.
Immigration into Sunderland is 2.4%, emigration is 2.2%.
At the 2001 census, 98.1% of the population were white, with 1% Asian and 0.4% mixed-race. [tpl]Cn|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The most ethnically diverse ward of the city was the (now defunct) Thornholme area. This ward, which included Eden Vale, Thornhill, as well as parts of Hendon, Ashbrooke and the city centre, has long been the focus of Wearside's Bangladeshi community. In Thornholme, 89.4% are white, 7.8% are Asian and 1.3% are mixed-race. The 2001 census also recorded a substantial concentration of Greek nationals, living mainly in Central and Thornholme wards. The least ethnically diverse wards are in the north of the city. The area of Castletown is made up of 99.3% white, 0.4% Asian and 0.2% mixed-race.

===Religion===

The area is part of the Anglican Diocese of Durham. It has been in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hexham since the Catholic hierarchy was restored in 1850.
According to census statistics, 81.5% of Sunderland residents class themselves as Christian, 9.6% are irreligious, 0.7% are Muslim and 7.6% did not wish to give their religion.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
114 people of Jewish faith were recorded as living in Sunderland. There was no Jewish community before 1750, though subsequently a number of Jewish merchants from across the UK and Europe settled in Sunderland. A rabbi from Holland was established in the city in 1790. The once thriving Jewish community has been in slow decline since the mid-20th century. Many Sunderland Jews left for stronger Jewish communities in Britain or to Israel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.999sunderland.com/|title=999 Sunderland[/tpl] The Jewish primary school, the Menorah School, closed in July 1983. The synagogue on Ryhope Road, opened in 1928, closed at the end of March 2006. (See also Jews and Judaism in North East England)

===Ship building and coal mining===

Once hailed as the "Largest Shipbuilding Town in the World",[tpl]cite web|title=History of Shipbuilding in the North East|work=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nationonfilm/topics/ship-building/background.shtml|accessdate=2007-01-18[/tpl] ships were built on the Wear from at least 1346 onwards and by the mid-18th century Sunderland was one of the chief shipbuilding towns in the country. The Port of Sunderland was significantly expanded in the 1850s with the construction of Hudson Dock to designs by River Wear Commissioner's Engineer John Murray, with consultancy by Robert Stephenson.[tpl]cite web|title=SINE Project: Structure details for South Dock: Hudson Dock|work=University of Newcastle upon Tyne|url=http://www.sine.ncl.ac.uk/view_structure_information.asp?struct_id=505|accessdate=2006-11-22[/tpl] One famous vessel was the Torrens, the clipper in which Joseph Conrad sailed, and on which he began his first novel. As Basil Lubbock states, Torrens was one of the most successful ships ever built, besides being one of the fastest, and for many years was the favourite passenger ship to Adelaide.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] She was one of the most famous ships of her time and can claim to be the finest ship ever launched from a Sunderland yard. She was built in ten months by James Laing at his Deptford yard on the Wear in 1875.
Between 1939 and 1945 the Wear yards launched 245 merchant ships totalling 1.5 million tons, a quarter of the merchant tonnage produced in the UK at this period. Competition from overseas caused a downturn in demand for Sunderland built ships toward the end of the 20th century. The last shipyard in Sunderland closed on 7 December 1988.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Sunderland Public Library Service|title=LOCAL STUDIES CENTRE FACT SHEET NUMBER 10:Shipbuilding on the Wear: Part 1|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=6958&p=0|accessdate=27 August 2013[/tpl]
Sunderland, part of the Durham coalfield, has a coal-mining heritage that dates back centuries. At its peak in 1923, 170,000 miners were employed in County Durham alone,[tpl]cite web|title=Rise and Fall of Coal Mining|work=North East England History|url=http://www.northeastengland.talktalk.net/CoalMiningandRailways.htm|accessdate=2007-01-18[/tpl] as labourers from all over Britain, including many from Scotland and Ireland, entered the region. As demand for coal slipped following World War II, mines began to close across the region, causing mass unemployment. The last coal mine closed in 1994. [tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] The site of the last coal mine, Wearmouth Colliery, is now occupied by the Stadium of Light, and a miner's Davy lamp monument stands outside of the ground to honour the site's mining heritage. Documentation relating to the region's coalmining heritage are stored at the North East England Mining Archive and Resource Centre (NEEMARC).

===Other industry===

As with the coal-mining and shipbuilding, overseas competition has forced the closure of all of Sunderland's glass-making factories. Corning Glass Works, in Sunderland for 120 years, closed on 31 March 2007 and in January 2007, the Pyrex manufacturing site also closed,[tpl]cite web|title=Energy costs close glass factory|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/6271617.stm|date=2007-01-17|accessdate=2007-01-18[/tpl] bringing to an end commercial glass-making in the city. However there has been a modest rejuvenation with the opening of the National Glass Centre which, amongst other things, provides international glass makers with working facilities and a shop to showcase their work, predominantly in the artistic rather than functional field.
Vaux Breweries was established in the town centre in the 1880s and for 110 years was a major employer. Following a series of consolidations in the British Brewing industry, however, the brewery was finally closed in July 1999. [tpl]Cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] Vaux in Sunderland and Wards in Sheffield had been part of the Vaux Group, but with the closure of both breweries it was re-branded The Swallow Group, concentrating on the hotel side of the business. This was subject to a successful take-over by Whitbread PLC in the autumn of 2000. It is now a brownfield site and this is a derelict site in an urban area.
In 1855, John Candlish opened a bottleworks, producing glass bottle, which was the largest in Europe [tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl], with 6 sites at nearby Seaham and at Diamond Hall, Sunderland.
John Candlish was Mayor of Sunderland in  both 1858 and 1861 and he also owned a shipbuilding firm which produced 70 vessels

===Regeneration===

Since the mid-1980s Sunderland has undergone massive regeneration, particularly around the central business district and the river corridor.

====1985 to 2009====

In the mid-1980s, Sunderland's economic situation began to improve following the collapse of shipbuilding in the town. In addition to the giant Nissan car factory opened in 1986, new service industries moved into sites such as the Doxford International Business Park in the south west of the city, attracting national and international companies. Sunderland was named in the shortlist of the top seven "intelligent cities" in the world for the use of information technology, in 2004 and 2005.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Pages/press/pritem.asp?Id=1021 |title=TOP OF THE WORLD |publisher=Sunderland City Council |date=2005-01-20 |accessdate=2006-12-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070312062944/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Pages/press/pritem.asp?Id=1021  |archivedate = 2007-03-12[/tpl]
The former shipyards along the Wear were transformed with a mixture of residential, commercial and leisure facilities including St. Peter's Campus of the University of Sunderland, University accommodation along the Fish Quay on the South side of the river, the North Haven housing and marina development, the National Glass Centre, the Stadium of Light and Hylton Riverside Retail Park. Also in 2007, the Echo 24 luxury apartments opened on Pann's Bank overlooking the river. In 2008 the Sunderland Aquatic Centre opened adjacent to the Stadium of Light, containing the only Olympic-size swimming pool between Leeds and Edinburgh.
In 2000, The Bridges shopping centre was extended towards Crowtree Road and the former Central Bus Station, attracting national chain stores including Debenhams, H&M, Schuh, Disney Store, Pandora (jewelry), La Senza, TopShop and Starbucks. This was followed by adjacent redevelopments on Park Lane.
Sunderland Corporation's massive post-war housing estate developments at Farringdon, Pennywell and Grindon have all passed into the ownership of Gentoo (previously 'Sunderland Housing Group'), a private company and a Registered Social Landlord. Since the housing stock transfer in 2000 there have been considerable improvements to the quality of social housing.
In 2004, redevelopment work began in the Sunniside area in the east-end of the city centre, including a multiplex cinema, a multi-storey car park, restaurants, a casino and tenpin bowling. Originally the River Quarter, the site was renamed Limelight in 2005, and renamed in 2008, when it became Sunniside Leisure. Sunniside Gardens were landscaped, and a number of new cafes, bars and restaurants were opened. Up-market residential apartments were developed, including the Echo 24 building.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sunderlandarc.co.uk/sunniside/ |title=Sunniside |date=2009-01-06 |accessdate=2009-03-10[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

====2010 and Beyond====

Sunderland City Council's Unitary Development Plan (UDP) outlines ambitious regeneration plans for a number of sites around the city.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/public/editable/themes/environment/planningandenvironment/planningpolicy/udp/udp/udphome-page.asp |title=Sunderland Unitary Development Plan |date=2009-01-06 |accessdate=2009-03-10[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The plans are supported by Sunderland Arc, an urban regeneration company funded by the City council, One NorthEast and the Homes and Communities Agency.
The Holmeside Triangle is an area adjacent to the Park Lane transport interchange, enclosed on three sides by Park Lane, Holmeside and railway tracks. Sunderland arc own 75% of the land,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sunderlandarc.co.uk/holmeside/ |title=Holmeside Triangle |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2009-03-10[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] currently occupied by a mixture of retail and commercial units including Park Lane Market.
£147 million plans for the site include the creation of extensive retail space, public meeting spaces, cafes, bars and restaurants, and a 33 storey Skyscraper called the Spirit of Sunderland, which would be the tallest building in North East England.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/business/Blueprint-for-city-skyscraper.3839525.jp |title=Blueprint for a Skyscraper |date=2008-03-04 |accessdate=2009-03-10[/tpl]
Since the closure of the Vaux brewery in 1999, a [tpl]convert|26|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] brownfield site has lain dormant in the centre of Sunderland. The land is subject to dispute between supermarket chain Tesco, who bought the site in 2001, and Sunderland arc, who submitted plans for its redevelopment in 2002.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.vauxsite.co.uk/faqs.aspx |title=Vaux Site FAQ |date=2008-03-04 |accessdate=2009-03-10[/tpl] During formal negotiations, Tesco stated they would be willing to sell the land to arc, if an alternative city centre site could be found. Possibilities include Holmeside Triangle, and the Sunderland Retail Park in Roker. Arc hope to begin development in 2010.
Arc's plans for the site were approved by the Secretary of State in 2007, and include extensive office space, hotels, leisure and retail units, residential apartments and a new £50 m Crown and Magistrates court. The central public arcade will be located under an expansive glass canopy. It is hoped an "evening economy" can be encouraged which will complement the city's nightlife.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.vauxsite.co.uk/this-is-the-opportunity.aspx |title=Vaux Site Opportunity|date=2008-03-04 |accessdate=2009-03-10[/tpl]
Redevelopment of the Monkwearmouth Colliery site, which sits of the north bank of the river Wear opposite the Vaux site, began in the mid-1990s with the creation of the Stadium of Light. In 2008, it was joined by the Sunderland aquatic centre.
The Sheepfolds industrial estate occupies a large area of land between the Stadium and the Wearmouth Bridge.
Sunderland arc are in the process of purchasing land in the Sheepfolds, with a view to relocate the businesses and redvelop the site. The emphasis of development plans include further sporting facilities, in order to create a Sports Village. Other plans include a hotel, residential accommodation, and a footbridge linking the site with the Vaux development.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sunderlandarc.co.uk/stadiumVillage/sheepfolds/index.aspx |title=Stadium Park Development|date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2009-03-10[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The Sunderland Strategic Transport Corridor (SSTC) is a proposed transport link from the A19, through the city centre, to the port. A major phase of the plan is the creation of a new bridge, which will link the A1231 Wessington Way on the north of the river with the Grove site in Pallion, on the south of the river.
In 2008, Sunderland City Council offered the residents of Sunderland the opportunity to vote on the design of the bridge. The choices were a [tpl]Convert|180|m|ft|-1[/tpl] iconic cable-stayed bridge, which would result in a temporary increase in council tax, or a simple box structure which would be within the council's budget.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/newbridge/ |title=New Bridge|date=2008-03-10 |accessdate=2009-03-10[/tpl]
The results of the consulatation were inconclusive, with residents keen to have an iconic bridge, but reluctant to have a subsequent increase in tax to fund it.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/Next-step-in-road-to.4747133.jp |title=Next step in road to iconic Wear bridge|date=2008-12-01 |accessdate=2009-03-10[/tpl]
Regardless of the ultimate design of the new bridge, the landing point will be the former Grove Cranes site in Pallion. Plans for this site focus around the creation of a new residential area, with homes, community buildings, commercial and retail space.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sunderlandarc.co.uk/groves/ |title=Gorve Site|date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2009-03-10[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Transport==

===Rail===

Sunderland station was opened in 1879 but was completely redesigned to facilitate football teams and officials from countries who were drawn to play at Roker Park during England's hosting of the 1966 World Cup. The station as it currently stands was opened on 4 November 1965 and since then little has changed in terms of the general appearance of the station.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] Situated on an underground level, the station is generally considered an eyesore [tpl]Who|date=August 2008[/tpl] and is currently undergoing renovation, backed by the artistic team which designed the stations along the Wearside extension of the Tyne and Wear Metro in 2002.[tpl]cite news|title= New look arriving|work=Sunderland Echo|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/New-look-will-be-arriving.1010574.jp|date=27 April 2005|accessdate=2008-03-03[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= New rail service launch delayed|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6168002.stm|date=21 November 2006|accessdate=2006-11-22[/tpl] It is situated on the Durham Coast Line served by direct Northern Rail services to Newcastle upon Tyne, Hartlepool, Stockton and Middlesbrough, as well as further afield to Hexham, Carlisle and the Gateshead MetroCentre. These services run hourly in each direction, cut from half-hourly on 12 December 2005.
From 1998 to 2004, Northern Spirit and subsequently Arriva Trains Northern ran bihourly direct trains from Sunderland to Liverpool Lime Street via Durham, Darlington, York, Leeds and Manchester. The services were withdrawn due to a change of franchise which saw the Transpennine Express route gain a franchise in its own right, distinct from the Regional Railways network which Arriva had inherited. Services now terminate at Newcastle, and a separate service also travels to Middlesbrough, but both only stretch as far as Manchester Airport.
In 2006, Grand Central Railway announced plans to operate a direct service between Sunderland and London King's Cross via York, a service which had been stripped from Wearside twenty years earlier. A scaled-down service of one train each day began in December 2007, twelve months after the initial launch date, due to delays caused by restoring rolling stock and a protracted court case against the now defunct GNER franchise (which Grand Central won). The service increased to three departures daily each way on 1 March 2008, connecting a line which can run from Edinburgh to London. The service has proved so popular that a fourth direct train is now in operation.

===Metro===

In May 2002 the Tyne and Wear Metro was extended to Sunderland in an official ceremony attended by The Queen, twenty-two years after it originally opened in Newcastle upon Tyne. The line now stretches deeper into South Tyneside and into Sunderland, incorporating Seaburn, Millfield, Pallion, as well as Sunderland's mainline railway station and stations at the Park Lane Transport Interchange and both campuses of the University of Sunderland before terminating at South Hylton.

===Road===

There are no motorways that run through the Sunderland urban area. The largest and busiest road is the A19, which runs north-to-south along the western edge of the urban area, crossing the River Wear at Hylton. The A19 originally ran through the city centre until the bypass was built in the 1970s, the route is now the A1018.
There are four main roads which support the city centre. The A690 Durham Road terminates in the city centre, and runs all the way to Crook, County Durham via the city of Durham. This is the main road supporting the south-west of the city.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
The A1231 starts in the city centre, crosses the Queen Alexandra Bridge and runs through Washington to the A1. Most of this road is national speed limit dual carriageway.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
The A1018 and A183 roads both start in the centre of South Shields and enter Sunderland from the north, before merging to cross the Wearmouth Bridge. The A1018 follows a direct route from Shields to Sunderland, the A183 follows the coast. After crossing the bridge, the A1018 follows a relatively straight path to the south of Sunderland where it merges with the A19. The A183 becomes Chester Road and heads west out of the city to the A1 at Chester-le-Street.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
In Autumn 2007 the Southern Radial Route was opened. This is a bypass of the A1018 through Grangetown and Ryhope – a stretch that commonly suffered from congestion, especially during rush hour. The bypass starts just south of Ryhope, and runs parallel to the cliff tops into Hendon, largely avoiding residential areas.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]

===Bus===

A multi-million pound transport interchange at Park Lane was opened on 2 May 1999 by the then Brookside actor Michael Starke. With 750,000 passengers per year it is the busiest bus and coach station in Britain after Victoria Coach Station in Central London, and has won several awards for innovative design.[tpl]cite news|title=Did you know?

A new Metro station was built underneath the bus concourse to provide a direct interchange as part of the extension to South Hylton in 2002.

===Cycle===

There are a number of cycle routes that run through and around Sunderland. The National Cycle Network National Route 1 runs from Ryhope in the south, through the centre of the city, and then along the coast towards South Shields.
Britain's most popular long-distance cycle route – The 'C2C' Sea to Sea Cycle Route – traditionally starts (or ends) when the cyclist dips their wheel in the sea on Roker beach. The 'W2W' 'Wear-to-Walney' route, and the 'Two-Rivers' (Tyne and Wear) route also terminate in Sunderland.
