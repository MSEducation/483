The New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Christian Bible. Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society) is the worldwide publisher and copyright holder of the NIV, and licenses commercial rights to Zondervan in the United States and to Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. The NIV has become one of the most popular modern translations in history.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cbaonline.org/nm/documents/BSLs/Bible_Translations.pdf | title=August 2009 CBA Best Sellers | accessdate=2011-02-09 | publisher = Christian Business Association [/tpl]New International Version #1 in dollar and unit sales Originally published in the 1970s, the NIV was updated in 1984 and 2011.

==History==

The New International Version project was started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity Christian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, of the Christian Reformed Church, National Association of Evangelicals, and a "group of international scholars".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo&vid=31#books&version=31;|title=New International Version Information[/tpl] The New York Bible Society (now Biblica) was selected to do the translation. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the full Bible in 1978.
In 1979 it was decided to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish with the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versión Internacional (often abbreviated NVI)[tpl]cite web|title=Nueva Versión Internacional - Version Information - BibleGateway.com|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/Nueva-Version-Internacional-Biblia-NVI/#vinfo[/tpl] though at this point this version was based only on the former English translation of the historic manuscripts. The English version underwent a minor revision in 1984. In 1990 the committee on Bible translation headed by Drs. René Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo to conducted a translation from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish of both testaments, bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI Bible in 1999.
A planned 1997 English edition was discontinued over inclusive language.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-09-01-bible-translation_N.htm | title=Update of popular 'NIV' Bible due in 2011 | accessdate=2011-09-20| publisher = USA TODAY | date=2009-09-01[/tpl] A revised English edition titled Today's New International Version (TNIV) released a New Testament in March 2002, with the complete Bible published February 2005. In 2011, an updated version was released. The update incorporated some of the gender language of the TNIV, along with other changes. Translational issues with Paul's letters were also addressed.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.zondervan.com/Cultures/en-US/NewsRoom/NewsReleases/NIV+online+viewing.htm?QueryStringSite=Zondervan | title=Updated NIV Text Available for Online Viewing November 1 | accessdate=2011-02-09 | publisher = Zondervan [/tpl][tpl]Citation | title = World’s most popular Bible to be revised | date = 9/1/2009 | year = 2009 | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32644719/ns/us_news-faith/|publisher=MSN.com | accessdate = 2011-02-19[/tpl] Keith Danby, president and chief executive officer of Biblica, said they erred in presenting past updates, failed to convince people revisions were needed, and underestimated reader loyalty to the 1984 NIV.

==Translation philosophy==

The core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/niv-translators.html | title=The NIV Committee on Bible Translation | accessdate=2011-02-09 | publisher = Bible Research [/tpl] The translation took ten years and involved a team of up to one hundred scholars[tpl]cite web | url=http://christianity.about.com/od/faqhelpdesk/p/newinternationa.htm | title=History of the New International Version | accessdate=2011-02-09 | publisher = About.com [/tpl] from the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The range of those participating included many different denominations such as Anglicans, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and Presbyterian.[tpl]cite book |last=Irwin |first=Ben |title=History of the English Bible |year=2002 |publisher=Zondervan |page=60 [/tpl]
The translation is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-thought.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nettopdf.info/download/ebook/BIBLE%20TRANSLATION%20CHART/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYXJkZWwuY29tL1VzZXJGaWxlcy9GaWxlL0JpYmxlJTIwVHJhbnNsYXRpb24lMjBDaGFydC5wZGY|title=Bible Translation Chart| accessdate=2011-02-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northwest.cc/uploads/2/1/0/1/210144/bibletranslationchart.pdf|title=Bible Translation Chart| accessdate=2011-02-09[/tpl] Recent archaeological and linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have traditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional translations were generally retained.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ibs.org/niv/background.php|title=Background of the New International Version (NIV) Bible[/tpl] "Although archaeological and linguistic discoveries in this century aid in understanding difficult passages", "As for other proper nouns, the familiar spellings of the King James Version are generally retained" Paragraphs 14 & 17

==Circulation==

According to the Christian Business Association, the New International Version has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide.[tpl]cite web|last=Menzie|first=Nicola|title=NIV remains the bestselling Bible translation|url=http://au.christiantoday.com/article/niv-remains-the-bestselling-bible-translation/15171.htm|work=Christian Today|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=27 March 2013[/tpl]
There are numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and background information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among these are the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, Concordia Study Bible, the Zondervan published NIV Study Bible, the Wesleyan revision, Reflecting God Study Bible, as well as the Life Application Study Bible.

==Reception==

Biblical scholar Bruce M. Metzger criticized[tpl]cite book|last=Metzger|first=Bruce M.|title=The Bible in Translation : Ancient and English Versions|year=2001|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids, MI|isbn=978-0-8010-2282-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d1sQAQAAIAAJ|authorlink=Bruce M. Metzger|accessdate=July 30, 2011|page=140[/tpl] the addition of just into Jeremiah 7:22 so the verse becomes "For when I brought your forefathers out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices." Metzger also criticized the addition of your into [tpl]bibleverse||Matthew|13:32|NIV[/tpl], so it becomes "Though it the mustard seed] is the smallest of all your seeds", avoiding any impression of Jesus's speaking a botanical untruth. The usage of your in this verse has been removed in the 2011 NIV revision. Concerning previous revisions, N. T. Wright has written that due to paraphrasing or interpretative glosses in Paul's letters that Protestants and Evangelicals will never understand what Paul was talking about if they rely on the NIV.[tpl]cite book|last=Wright|first=N.
