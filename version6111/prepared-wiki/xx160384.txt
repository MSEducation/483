CFEL-FM (or CKOI 102,1 Québec) is a French-language Canadian radio station located in Quebec City, Quebec, but the station's official city of license is Lévis.
Owned and operated by Leclerc Communication Inc., it broadcasts on 102.1 MHz using a directional antenna with an average effective radiated power of 26,500 watts and a peak effective radiated power of 78,000 watts (class C1).
The station has a contemporary hit radio format branded as 102,1 CKOI.
The station identifies itself as CKOI 102,1 Québec since November 6, 2009, though its legal calls of CFEL-FM remain the same.  Its logo was similar to sister stations CKOI Montreal and CKOI Estrie; however, as of February 2011, CFEL-FM still uses this logo, though the other stations on the CKOI network have changed its logos and imaging.
Originally based in and licensed to Montmagny, CFEL-FM received its first licence in December 1986 and replaced CKBM 1490, an unrelated station which closed due to a bankruptcy in 1983.CRTC proceedings from March 21, 2006 (in French), paragraph 3977 http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/transcripts/2006/tb0321.htm.
