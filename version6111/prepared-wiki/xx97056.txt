[[Lauburu]]

CATEGORIES: Cross symbols, Basque culture, Swastika

The lauburu or Basque cross has four comma-shaped heads. It can be constructed with a compass and straightedge, beginning with the formation of a square template; each head can be drawn from a neighboring vertex of this template with two compass settings, with one radius half the length of the other.

==Background==

Historians and authorities have attempted to apply allegorical meaning to the ancient symbol. Some say it signifies the "four heads or regions" of the Basque Country. The lauburu does not appear in any of the seven coats-of-arms that have been combined in the arms of the Basque Country: Higher and Lower Navarre, Gipuzkoa, Biscay, Álava, Labourd, and Soule. The Basque intellectual Imanol Mujica liked to say that the heads signify spirit, life, consciousness, and form, but it is generally used as a symbol of prosperity.
After the time of the Antonines, Camille JullianM. Camille Jullian in his preface to La tombe basque, according to Lauburu: La swástika rectilínea (Auñamendi Entziklopedia). finds no specimen of swastikas, round nor straight, in the Basque area until modern times.
Paracelsus's Archidoxis Magicae features a symbolPicture in the Auñamendi Entziklopedia. similar to the lauburu that is to be drawn to heal animals.
M. Colas considers that the lauburu is not related to the swastika but comes from Paracelsus and marks the tombs of healers of animals and healers of souls (i.e. priests).
Around the end of the 16th century, the lauburu appears abundantly as a Basque decorative element, in wooden chests or tombs, perhaps as another form of the cross.Lauburu: Conclusiones in Auñamendi Entziklopedia.
Straight swastikas are not found until the 19th century.
Many Basque homes and shops display the symbol over the doorway as a sort of talisman. 
Sabino Arana interpreted it as a solar symbol, supporting his theory of a Basque solar cult based on wrong etymologies, in the first number of Euzkadi.
The lauburu has been featured on flags and emblems of various Basque political organisations including Eusko Abertzale Ekintza (EAE-ANV). 
The use of the lauburu as a cultural icon fell into some disuse under the Francoist dictatorship, who repressed many elements of Basque culture.

==Etymology==

Lau buru means "four heads", "four ends" or "four summits" in Basque. Some[tpl]who?|date=April 2014[/tpl] argue this might be a folk etymology applied to the  Latin labarum.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/index.php?option=com_oeh&view=frontpage&Itemid=413&lang=eu |title=Orotariko Euskal Hiztegia |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Euskaltzaindia |accessdate=12 January 2013[/tpl]
However, Father Fidel Fita thought the relation reversed, labarum being adapted from Basque in Octavian Augustus' time.Letter from Fita to Fernández Guerra, reproduced in his Cantabria, note 8, page 126, reproduced in Historia crítica de Vizcaya y de sus Fueros, by Gregorio Balparda, according to Auñamendi Entziklopedia
