[[Sphaerotheca fuliginea]]

CATEGORIES: Plant pathogens and diseases, Leotiomycetes

Sphaerotheca fuliginea is a plant pathogen that causes powdery mildew on cucurbits. Sphaerotheca fuliginea and Erysiphe cichoracearum are the two most commonly recorded fungi causing cucurbit powdery mildew. In the past, Erysiphe cichoracearum was considered to be the primary causal organism throughout most of the world. Today, Sphaerotheca fuliginea is more commonly reported.[ref]Tetteh, A, et al.

==Signs and symptoms==

Powdery mildew is manifest on the plant by white powdery fungal growth on the surface of the leaf, usually both sides of the leaf show fungal growth.McGrath, M.T., 1997. Powdery Mildew of Cucurbits. http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/factsheets/Cucurbits_PM.htm The host tissue is frequently stunted, distorted, discolored, and scarred.Glawe, D.A., Grove, G.G., 2010. Powdery Mildew Diseases. http://plant-disease.ippc.orst.edu/articles.cfm?article_id=30 The fruit of infected plants are usually smaller and the flavor is affected negatively, as fewer sugars and solids are stored in the fruit.Trigiano, R.N., Windham, M.T., Windham, A.S., 2008. Plant Pathology: Concepts and Laboratory Exercises 2nd Edition. CRC Press.

==Disease Cycle==

Sphaerotheca fuliginea uses haustoria to gain access to the leaf epidermal cells. The fungus is usually spread during the spring through mycelium from infected plant, or through ascocarps.  Signs appear after 3–7 days of infection if conditions are favorable.  The mycelium grows rapidly during the warm summer months with an optimum temperature of about 50-90 degrees F.[ref]Doubrava, N, et al. 2007. Cucumber, Squash, Melon & Other Cucurbit Diseases.

[/ref] The leaves are most susceptible 16–23 days after unfolding.Cheah, L.H., et al. 1996. Epidemiology of Powdery Mildew (Sphaerotheca fuliginea) of Squash. http://www.nzpps.org/journal/49/nzpp_491470.pdf High humidity favors the development of disease, but infection can occur at  relative humidity as low a 50%. The conidia of the fungus are spread through the air and thus can travel over great distances.Webster, J., Weber, R.W.S., 2007. Introduction to Fungi 3rd Edition. Cambridge University Press. 401-413 The mycelium can also overwinter in the buds of infected plants.

==Control==

The most common way to control the spread of Sphaerotheca fuliginea is with the use of fungicides. Usually sulphur or demethylation inhibitor fungicides are applied. Fungicides are usually applied once a week. Plants should also be kept physically separated to control spread because older plants can be a source of conidia.
