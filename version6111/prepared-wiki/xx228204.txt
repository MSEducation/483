==History==

Peter created some memorable close-up magic effects. He contributed many routines to various magic periodicals.[tpl]cite web |url=http://geniimagazine.com/wiki/index.php/Peter_Kane |title= Peter Kane MagicPedia entry[/tpl]
His most popular routine is probably Watch the Ace which is better known as "Wild Card" which was released as a packet trick in 1962. He also created a version with Tarot cards called Gypsy Curse.
Ethics among magic dealers has not always been of the highest standard, and magic dealers around the world jumped on the band wagon and started putting together their own Wild Card sets. By then Tannen's Magic Shop had already flooded the market. Later it was learned that the original concept came from the creative mind of Peter Kane; hence, a flap in the making that has never died.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stevensmagic.com/gemini/Mike%20Rogers/WildCardVariation.htm |title= Mike Rogers column[/tpl]
Other routines that spurred many variations include: Jazz Aces, Elongated Lady, and The Shrinking Card Case.
