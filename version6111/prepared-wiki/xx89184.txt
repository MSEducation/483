Enalapril (marketed as Vasotec in the USA, Enaladex in some other countries, and Enacard for veterinary useEnacard listed at http://www.drugs.com.) is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, and some types of chronic heart failure. ACE converts the peptide hormone angiotensin I to angiotensin II. One of the actions of angiotensin II is the vasoconstriction of blood vessels resulting in an increase in blood pressure. ACE inhibitors such as enalapril prevent this effect. Enalapril has been shown to lower the death rate in systolic heart failure.McMurray JJV, Systolic heart failure, N Engl J Med, 362:228, Jan. 21, 2010). Enalapril was the first member of the group known as the dicarboxylate-containing ACE inhibitors.
It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[tpl]cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Medical uses==

Enalapril is used to treat hypertension, symptomatic heart failure, and treatment of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Enalapril has been proven to protect the function of the kidneys in hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes. Enalapril may be used by physicians in the absence of hypertension for its kidney protective effects. (Enalapril Maleate Tablet)

===Pregnancy and breast feeding===

Enalapril is pregnancy category D. There is evidence to suggest that enalapril will cause injury and death to a developing fetus. Patients are advised not to become pregnant while taking enalapril and to notify their doctor immediately if they become pregnant. In pregnancy, enalapril may result in damage to the fetus’s kidneys and resulting oligohydramnios (not enough amniotic fluid). Enalapril is secreted in breast milk and is not recommended for use while breastfeeding. (Enalapril Maleate Tablet)

==Side effects==

The most common side effects of enalapril include increased serum creatinine (20%), dizziness (2-8%), low blood pressure (1-7%), syncope (2%), and dry cough (1-2%). The most serious common adverse event is angioedema (swelling) (0.68%) which often affects the face and lips endangering the patient’s airway. Angioedema can occur at any point during treatment with enalapril but is most common after the first few doses. (Enalapril Maleate Tablet)

==Development==

Enalapril as a treatment for high blood pressure works by modulating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).
Squibb developed the first inhibitor, captopril, but it had adverse effects such as a metallic taste (which, as it turned out, was due to the sulfhydryl group). Merck & Co. developed enalapril as a competing prodrug.

==Enalaprilat==

Enalaprilat, the first dicarboxylate-containing ACE inhibitor, was developed partly to overcome these limitations of captopril. The sulfhydryl moiety was replaced by a carboxylate moiety, but additional modifications were required in its structure-based design to achieve a similar potency to captopril.
Enalaprilat, however, had a problem of its own. The consequence of the structural modifications was it proved to have unfavourable ionisation characteristics to allow sufficient potency for oral administration (in tablets). Thus, it was only suitable for intravenous administration. This was overcome by the researchers at Merck by the esterification of enalaprilat with ethanol to produce enalapril.
As a prodrug, enalapril is metabolised in vivo to the active form enalaprilat by various esterases. Peak plasma enalaprilat concentrations occur two to four hours after oral administration. Elimination thereafter is biphasic, with an initial phase which reflects renal filtration (elimination half-life two to six hours) and a subsequent prolonged phase (elimination half-life 36 hours), the latter representing equilibration of drug from tissue distribution sites.
The prolonged phase does not contribute to drug accumulation on repeated administration, but is thought to be of pharmacological significance in mediating drug effects. Renal impairment creatinine clearance 
==Mechanism of action==

Enalapril belongs to a class of medications called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Normally angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II constricts blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. By inhibiting ACE, Enalapril decreases levels of angiotensin II leading to less vasoconstriction and decreased blood pressure.(Enalapril Maleate Tablet)

==Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics==

Onset of action: ~1 hour
Peak effect: 4-6 hours
Duration: 12-24 hours
Absorption: 55% to 75% 
Protein binding: ~50% (Davies, 1984) 
Metabolism: Prodrug, undergoes hepatic biotransformation to enalaprilat 
Half-life elimination: 
Enalapril: Adults: Healthy: 2 hours; Congestive heart failure: 3.4-5.8 hours 
Enalaprilat: Adults: ~35 hours (Till, 1984; Ulm, 1982)
Time to peak, serum: Oral: Enalapril: 0.5-1.5 hours; Enalaprilat (active metabolite): 3-4.5 hours 
Excretion: Urine (61%; 18% of which was enalapril, 43% was enalaprilat); feces (33%; 6% of which was enalapril, 27% was enalaprilat) (Ulm, 1982)
