==History==

Smith Barney & Co. was formed in 1938 through the merger of Charles D. Barney & Co. and Edward B. Smith & Co..  Charles D. Barney & Co., a New York and Philadelphia based firm, was founded by Charles D. Barney in 1873 following the failure of its predecessor Jay Cooke & Company.  Edward B. Smith & Co., founded in 1892 became a significant player in securities underwriting in 1934 when the firm absorbed the professionals from the securities business of Guaranty Trust Company, following the passage of the Glass Steagall Act.Business: Marriage of Convenience.  TIME Magazine, December 20, 1937
In 1975, Smith Barney merged with Harris, Upham & Co. to form Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., which, in 1977, was placed under SBHU Holdings, a holding company.

===Sale to Morgan Stanley===

During the major financial crisis beginning in late 2008, Citigroup suffered large losses in its retained collateralized debt obligation exposure (loans that Citi underwrote but was not able to sell), and had to be rescued by the U.S. federal government. They decided to sell or close "non-core" businesses in order to raise money. On January 13, 2009, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup announced the merger of Smith Barney with Morgan Stanley's Global Wealth Management Group, with Morgan Stanley paying $2.7 billion cash upfront to Citigroup for a 51% stake in the joint venture. The joint venture operates as Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.citigroup.com/citi/press/2009/090113c.pdf |title=Morgan Stanley and Citi to Form Industry-Leading Wealth Management Business Through Joint Venture |accessdate=January 13, 2009 |date=January 13, 2009 |publisher=Citigroup |pages= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= [/tpl] Morgan Stanley itself was in a financially cash-strapped position like Citigroup during that time, but they were helped by $9 billion investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group for a 21% stake in Morgan Stanley.
On June 1, 2009, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. announced they closed early on the launch of their joint venture that combines Morgan Stanley's wealth management unit (including many former Dean Witter assets) with Citi's Smith Barney brokerage division. The new venture, called Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, was supposed to launch during the third quarter. The combined entity generates about $14 billion in net revenue, has 18,500 financial advisers, 1,000 locations worldwide and serves about 6.8 million households.BusinessWeek
