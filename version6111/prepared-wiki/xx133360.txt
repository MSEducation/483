==Plot==

Abigail and Roger are an engaged couple living separately in bedsits in London. Abigail is a shorthand typist, who is outspoken and very capable domestically, she can mend a fuse, cook, drive and so on. Roger works in the City and is into keeping fit and planning for their future. Much of the humour arose from the different attitudes to life, and their interest in the attractions of London.

The show was originally meant to run for thirteen weeks, as a summer replacement for the soap opera The Grove Family, but in fact only ran for nine weeks. The entire series is thought to be lost.
