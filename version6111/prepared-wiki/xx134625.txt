</ref> In several Saint stories, Teal is shown unexpectedly noticing a detail or uncovering a clue that more often than not hinders Templar's quest for "[[boodle]]" (loot), as in, for example, the story "The Unusual Ending" in ''The Brighter Buccaneer''.<ref>

Teal, however, is also shown acknowledging Templar's crimefighting and deduction abilities on numerous occasions. Although an attempt to make Templar an agent of Scotland Yard meets with failure (as seen in the novel She Was a Lady[ref]
</ref>), Teal is often seen turning to Templar for advice and, occasionally, "off-book" assistance on a case. Templar, in return, willingly allows Teal to receive the credit (and, sometimes, the blame) when a case is resolved, though he is quick to berate Teal whenever he feels Teal is treating him unfairly and with undue suspicion.
Teal disappears from the book series for a time after the 1939 short story collection The Happy Highwayman, as the Saint entered into a series of books set in America during World War II, reappearing after the war.
In "The Talented Husband" (a short story in the 1956 collection The Saint Around the World) the Saint returns to the UK and indulges in one final round of 'Teal-baiting' before the Chief Inspector retires.[ref]
