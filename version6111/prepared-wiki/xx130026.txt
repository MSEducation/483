The 2001 Michigan vs. Michigan State football game, also known as Clockgate, was played on November 3, 2001 at Spartan Stadium.
While the game was closely played throughout, it is the game's conclusion that is most remembered. On fourth-and-goal, Michigan State quarterback Jeff Smoker threw a touchdown pass to running back T. J. Duckett as time expired to win 26–24.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bigtennetwork.com/dpp/programming/greatest-games-football-3 |title=Greatest Games: Football Season 3 |date=26 August 2010 |work=BigTenNetwork.com |accessdate=17 May 2011 |quote=Michigan State 26, #6 Michigan 24: This controversial game was settled on the game's final play when Michigan State quarterback Jeff Smoker threw a touchdown pass to running back T.J.

==Lead-up to the game==

The Wolverines came into East Lansing with a 6–1 (4–0) record and a #6 ranking behind wins against Miami (Ohio), [tpl]cfb link|year=2001|team=Western Michigan Broncos|title=Western Michigan[/tpl], Penn State, Iowa, and eventual Big Ten champion Illinois.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cfreference.net/cfr/school.s?id=25&season=2001 |title=University of Michigan - 2001 |date= |work=College Football Reference |accessdate=23 May 2011[/tpl] Michigan was the only team in the Big Ten without a loss four games into the Big Ten season,[tpl]cite web |url=http://cfreference.net/cfr/conf.s?id=22&season=2001 |title=Big Ten Conference - 2001 |date= |work=College Football Reference |accessdate=23 May 2011[/tpl] and despite an early non-conference loss at Washington, the Wolverines were considered national title contenders.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.msuspartans.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/103101aaa.html |title=Wolverines Look to Stay In National Title Hunt In Matchup With Spartans |date=31 October 2001 |work=Michigan State Official Athletic Site |publisher=Michigan State University |author= |accessdate=23 May 2011[/tpl] The Wolverines led the Big Ten in rushing defense, conceding just 54.4 yards per game, but looked to be challenged by Michigan State running back T. J. Duckett, who averaged 105.5 rushing yards per game going into the contest. In the previous week, linebacker Larry Foote set a Michigan school record with 7 tackles for a loss against Iowa and seemed poised to put serious pressure on the Spartan offense.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.washtenawvoice.com/?p=5837 |title=Michigan Wolverines Football |author=Matt Thompson |date=10 January 2010 |work=The Washtenaw Voice |publisher=Washtenaw Community College |accessdate=23 May 2011[/tpl]
The Spartans came into the contest 4–2 (2–2) with early losses at Northwestern and Minnesota[tpl]cite web |url=http://cfreference.net/cfr/school.s?id=244&season=2001 |title=Michigan State University - 2001 |date= |work=College Football Reference |accessdate=23 May 2011[/tpl] but led the Big Ten in passing yards (271.3 yards per game) behind star sophomore wide receiver Charles Rogers and sophomore quarterback Jeff Smoker. The Spartans had won three of the previous four meetings against the Wolverines in East Lansing. It was coach Bobby Williams' first home game against the Wolverines. Kickoff return specialist and wide receiver Herb Haygood led the nation in kickoff return average (33.2 yards per return) and looked to give the Wolverines a serious challenge on special teams.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.msuspartans.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/103001aaa.html |title=Spartan Football Prepares For Instate Battle Against No. 6 Michigan |date=30 October 2001 |work=Michigan State Official Athletic Site |publisher=Michigan State University |author= |accessdate=23 May 2011[/tpl]

==Scoring==

===1st Quarter===

On the opening drive of the game Michigan State found itself in a fourth down situation on Michigan's 31 yard line and sent punter Craig Jarrett onto the field along with two wide receivers to attempt a fake punt. Although Jarrett's pass was incomplete, Michigan cornerback Marlin Jackson was flagged for pass interference for his coverage on Charles Rogers, which gave Michigan State a fresh set of downs and 15 extra yards.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/last-second-heroics-doom-wolverines |title=Last-second heroics doom Wolverines |author=Arun Gopal |date=5 November 2001 |work=The Michigan Daily |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=23 May 2011[/tpl] Two plays later, Smoker threw a 17-yard touchdown to Rogers in the back of the end zone to give the Spartans a 7–0 lead.
On the ensuing drive, Michigan kicker Hayden Epstein made a school-record 57-yard field goal to put the Wolverines on the board and cut the lead to 7–3.

===2nd Quarter===

At 12:07 of the 2nd quarter, Michigan took its first lead on a 14 yard touchdown pass from John Navarre to Marquise Walker, capping an eight-play, 67-yard drive and making it 10–7.
On 3rd and 4, 7:45 into the 2nd quarter, the Spartans were driving on the Wolverines 13-yard line. Smoker threw an incomplete pass to Rogers in the end zone, but Michigan was flagged for pass interference once again.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.msuspartans.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/110301aaa.html |title=Last-Second Smoker Pass Spells Defeat For No. 6 Michigan  |author=Larry Lage |date=3 November 2001 |work=Michigan State Official Athletic Site |publisher=Michigan State University |accessdate=23 May 2011[/tpl] The penalty gave Michigan State a first down with goal to go, and on the very next play, T. J. Duckett ran 2 yards up the middle for a touchdown that put the Spartans up 14–10.
The Wolverines struck back on the next series, as Walker caught a 32-yard touchdown pass to complete an 80-yard drive and give Michigan a 17–14 lead.

===3rd Quarter===

The only scoring in the 3rd quarter came courtesy of Michigan State placekicker Dave Rayner, who kicked a 17-yard field goal with 12 seconds remaining in the quarter to knot the score at 17.

===4th Quarter===

With 7:33 left, Rayner hit another 17-yard field goal that gave Michigan State a 20–17 lead.
A Smoker fumble on the Michigan State 38 yard line was recovered by Michigan defensive tackle Grant Bowman with six minutes left. On the ensuing possession, Navarre threw a 20-yard touchdown to backup quarterback Jermaine Gonzales, who had lined up as a wide receiver, that gave the Wolverines a 24–20 lead.

==Final drive==

With 2:28 left in the fourth quarter, Michigan was forced to punt from deep in its own zone. Hayden Epstein's kick was his shortest of the day, a 28-yarder that gave the Spartans excellent field position at the Wolverines' 44 yard line. On first and second down, Smoker was sacked for two of the Wolverines' school-record 12 sacks. Following an incompletion, the Spartans faced 4th and 16 from midfield.
On fourth down, Smoker's pass fell incomplete, but Michigan defensive back Jeremy LeSueur was flagged for grabbing the facemask of receiver Charles Rogers, giving the Spartans fifteen yards and an automatic first down. Two plays later, wide receiver Herb Haygood caught a pass over the middle for 17 yards and another first down.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/110301aaa.html |title=Wolverines Fall at Michigan State on Game's Final Play  |date=3 November 2001 |work=University of Michigan Official Athletic Site |publisher=University of Michigan |author=David Ablauf |author2=Jim Schneider |accessdate=24 May 2011[/tpl]
On 1st and 10, Smoker was sacked again by the Wolverine defense, but Michigan was flagged for having 12 men on the field. However, referees failed to stop the clock at the time of the penalty, forcing the Spartans to use their final timeout. After an incompletion on the resulting 2nd and 4 from the 12 yard line, LeSueur broke up a 3rd down pass intended for Duckett in the end zone to bring up 4th down. Facing 4th and 4, Smoker completed a slant up the middle to Duckett for 8 yards that resulted in a first and goal on the Michigan 3 yard line.
Michigan State rushed to spike the ball on 1st down, stopping the clock with 17 seconds left. On second and goal, Smoker rolled to the right and ran the ball down to the two yard line, but was tackled inbounds, so the clock continued to run. With time running out, the Spartans frantically lined up to spike the ball; when they did so, the stadium clock showed a single second remaining. Michigan coaches, players, and the ABC broadcasters argued that the clock should have expired on the play and that the timekeeper, known as "Spartan Bob", purposely stopped the clock before the ball was grounded. Michigan commentator Frank Beckmann speculated that Michigan State had benefited from its home field advantage, even calling the unfolding controversy "criminal" on the air. On the ensuing play, Smoker lobbed a pass into the back of the end zone where it was caught by Duckett, giving the Spartans a 26–24 victory.

==Controversy==

Debates on the last remaining second continue to this day. Some contend that clock operator Bob Stehlin, known colloquially as "Spartan Bob,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071030/SPORTS06/71030008/1054|title=Frank Beckmann's memorable moments as a broadcaster|date=30 October 2007|work=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=3 October 2009[/tpl] stopped the clock before the spike play had actually concluded, to give the Spartans one more chance. Stehlin subsequently received threatening phone calls.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/article/20111009/GW01/110090482/MSU-football-10-years-later-Spartan-Bob-peace |title=MSU football: 10 years later, 'Spartan Bob' at peace |date= 9 Oct 2011 |work= Lansing State Journal |author= Joe Rexrode |accessdate= 9 Oct 2011[/tpl]
Not all responses laid blame on the timekeeper. An editorial cartoonist at the Michigan Daily, the University of Michigan student newspaper, depicted the aftermath of the game with a Michigan player trying to explain to two referees that the clock ran out, but also holding a gun that he had used to shoot himself in the foot (implying that had they not made critical mistakes previously, the clock would have not been an issue).[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3vhJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5R0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1611%2C3488036 |title=Editorial cartoon |date=November 7, 2001 |work=The Michigan Daily |publisher=University of Michigan |author=Cullen |accessdate= 17 March 2012[/tpl]

==Fallout==

Three years after the game, Big Ten officials told The Detroit News that, upon further review, the clock operator acted appropriately. Dave Parry, the conference's coordinator of football officials, said, "that play, as much as we've put that under a high-powered microscope, was correct. We could not prove that timer wrong."[tpl]cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?s_site=detnews&f_site=detnews&f_sitename=Detroit+News%2C+The+%28MI%29&p_theme=gannett&p_product=DTNB&p_action=search&p_field_base-0=&Search=Search&p_perpage=10&p_maxdocs=200&p_queryname=700&s_search_type=keyword&p_sort=YMD_date%3AD&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date%3AB%2CE&p_text_date-0=&p_text_base-0=%22Dave+Parry%22&as_qdr=all&cx=005007237836807668232%3Auux4ksdlbta |title=Big Ten puts own mark on video replays (ArticleID: det19481247) |date=August 5, 2004 |work= The Detroit News|author=|accessdate= 17 March 2012[/tpl]
To prevent the controversy caused by this game and others, the Big Ten changed its timekeeping policy for the 2002 season, having previously studied changing the policy prior to the Michigan–Michigan State game.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/article/20111009/GW01/110090482/MSU-football-10-years-later-Spartan-Bob-peace?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|FRONTPAGE |title=MSU football: 10 years later, 'Spartan Bob' at peace  |date= 9 Oct 2011 |work= |publisher= Lansing State Journal |author= Joe Rexrode |accessdate= 9 Oct 2011[/tpl] Previously, the home team appointed an individual of their choosing to keep the official time in the pressbox.[tpl]cite web |url=http://deadspin.com/5643013/definitive-proof-that-time-expired-before-msus-miracle-and-why-it-doesnt-matter |title=Definitive Proof That Time Expired Before MSU’s Miracle, And Why It Doesn’t Matter |date=20 September 2010 |work=Deadspin.com |author=Barry Petchesky |accessdate=17 May 2011 |quote= In 2001,...the clock operators were school employees; in that case, "Spartan Bob" Stehlin. But after that fiasco, the Big Ten and the entire NCAA made changes. Since 2002, a neutral official controls the stadium time.[/tpl] Now, time is kept on the field by a neutral official appointed by the Big Ten.
In addition to agreeing to change its policy on timekeeping, the Big Ten began a study on the feasibility of an instant replay system in 2003.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/archive/090605aaa.html |title=Big Ten Conference Football Replay  |date= |work=Big Ten Official Athletic Site |publisher= |author= |accessdate=26 May 2011[/tpl] In 2004, the Big Ten was the first conference to begin a trial replay system for all games played in conference stadiums. In 2005, most NCAA Division I-A teams had the option of using instant replay for their games after the NCAA approved the Big Ten's proposal to allow individual conferences to experiment with their own replay systems. Finally, in 2006, instant replay became standard across all NCAA Division I-A conferences.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/football/ncaa/05/30/instant.replay/index.html?section=si_topstories |title=One challenge per team: Upon further review, NCAA approves instant replay |date=30 May 2006 |work=SI.com |publisher=Sports Illustrated |author= |accessdate=26 May 2011[/tpl]
Still, to this day, the game has been dubbed a classic by college football fans due to the 1 tie, 7 lead changes, and ending controversy. ESPN Classic and the BigTen Network have both featured the game as part of their classic college football series.
