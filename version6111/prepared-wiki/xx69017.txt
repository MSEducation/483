</ref>  Bicycle messengers have not become common in southern Europe, the heartland of world competitive cycling. There are very few bicycle couriers in Portugal, France, Spain, or Italy. Outside Europe and North America, there are now large bicycle messenger services in Japan, and also in [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]. More recently, several companies started offering bike messenger services in Central and South America, specifically in México City, México; San José, Costa Rica; Bogotá, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina and Santiago, Chile

==Demand for courier services==

Messengers carry a huge variety of items, from things that could not be sent by digital means (corporate gifts, original artwork, clothes for photo-shoots, original signed documents) to mundane items that could easily be emailed, albeit without the air of importance attached to an express courier delivery. Messengers deliver digital content on optical media or hard disks because, despite high speed broadband connections, companies find it easier to send a disc than to work out how to transmit larger amounts of data that an email account can handle.[tpl]cite web | title = Piracy And Securing The Digital Media Supply Chain | url = http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&art_aid=73253 |date=2007-12-31 | publisher = Video Insider | accessdate = 2008-01-05[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Sneakernet Redux: Walk Your Data | url = http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,54739,00.html |date=2002-08-26 | publisher = Wired Magazine | accessdate = 2007-09-19[/tpl] Legal documents, various financial instruments and sensitive information are routinely sent by courier, reflecting a distrust of digital cryptography.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub92/lynch.html | title = Authenticity and Integrity in the Digital Environment |date=2000-05-01 | publisher = Council on Library and Information Resources [/tpl]

The gradual acceptance of electronic filing by U.S. courts has had a negative effect on the market.

==Working conditions==

The conditions of employment of bicycle messengers vary from country to country, city to city and even company to company. Contracts governing the relationship between individual courier and company are subject as much to customary practice, as local ordinance. In some places messengers are independent contractors paid on commission and do not receive benefits such as health insurance.  In other places they will be regular employees of the courier company enjoying all the benefits thereof.
The employment status of the bicycle messengers of one of the UK's biggest same-day courier services, CitySprint, was challenged by the GMB trade union in December 2007. The challenge arose after the firm terminated the contract of one of its riders. The GMB sought to establish that more than 1,500 CitySprint operatives currently classified as self-employed sub-contractors should be re-classified as employees.[tpl]cite news  |author= Nick Mathiason |title= Christmas sacking starts fight for rights of dispatched courier |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/dec/23/2 |publisher= Guardian Media |location= London, UK |date= 2007-12-23 |accessdate=2007-12-24 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080106124055/http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/dec/23/2| archivedate= 6 January 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Recent US legislation has sought to force companies to reclassify workers that they declare as independent contractors, as employees, with all the benefits thereof.

The job is poorly paid relative to the risk and effort required.  In 2002, a Harvard Medical School study of injury rates amongst Boston bicycle messengers determined that the rate of injury requiring time off work amongst the sample group was more than 13 times the U.S. average, and more than three times higher than the next highest group, workers in the meat-packing industry.[ref]

[/tpl] Eight bicycle messengers are known to have been killed while working in London between 1989 and 2003.  Because payment is made at piece rates, it is hard to get reliable figures for messenger income.  A study published in 2006 stated that the average daily wage of London bicycle messengers was £65 a day, and that of bicycle messenger in Cardiff was £45.[tpl]cite journal | last= Fincham | first= Ben  |year= 2007  |title= ‘Generally speaking people are in it for the cycling and the beer’: Bicycle couriers, subculture and enjoyment |journal= The Sociological Review|volume=  55|issue= (2)|pages= 192  |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-954X.2007.00701.x [/tpl]  The UK legal minimum wage at that time was £5.52 an hour.

==Licensing==

In most cities, there are no legal requirements beyond those applying to all cyclists. Some jurisdictions, though, require the licensing of courier bicycles. In Calgary, Alberta for example, metal license plates must be fixed to bicycles used for courier work.[tpl]cite web | title = Calgary City Business License information FAQ | publisher = City of Calgary | url = http://www.calgary.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_104_0_0_35/http%3B/content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Hall/Business+Units/Development+and+Building+Approvals+and+Land+Use+Planning+and+Policy/Business+Licences/Business+Licence+FAQs.htm#Question4 | accessdate = 2009-01-18[/tpl] Vancouver, British Columbia additionally requires bicycle messengers to complete a test in order to obtain a license, and to carry an identification card.[tpl]cite web | title = City of Vancouver Community Services/Licenses and Inspections | publisher = City of Vancouver | url = http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/LICANDINSP/licences/pdf/bikecourierguide.pdf | accessdate = 2010-10-08[/tpl]

==Equipment==

The most essential piece of equipment for a bicycle messenger is a bicycle.
The majority of messengers use a bag to carry deliveries and personal effects. Bags with a single strap that wraps diagonally across the chest (popularly known as messenger bag) are popular because they can be swung around the messenger's body to allow access without removing the bag. Clasps which can be adjusted with one hand (ideal for riding), clips, pockets and webbing loops on the strap for holding a cell phone or two-way radio and other equipment also feature on purpose-built messenger bags. Bags generally have large capacities (up to 50 liters or 3,000 cubic inches).  Baskets and racks mounted on the bike are also used, and at least one messenger service (in New York City) equips its riders with specialized three-wheel cycles (sometimes known as cargo-trikes), with a large trunk in the rear. Many bicycle messengers also wear helmets and mount lights and fenders to their bicycles.
Because bicycle thefts are prevalent in many cities,[ref]
