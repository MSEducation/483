==''Touching the void ascent==

In 1985 Siula Grande was climbed by Joe Simpson and Simon Yates.  Their ascent was made famous by Simpson's book Touching the Void, which describes the ascent and subsequent harrowing descent of the mountain. The book was made into a film of the same title in 2003. Although they ascended the West face, and thereby became the first to reach the summit by that route, they chose the North Ridge (first descended in 1936 by an Austrian team) for their descent which was made almost impossible by horrible weather which in turn caused Joe Simpson to fall and severely break his leg. All subsequent climbers have avoided the ridge and rappelled back down the face.

==Siula Chico==

Siula Chico is a subpeak about [tpl]convert|6260|m|abbr=on[/tpl] high separated from Siula Grande by an approximately [tpl]convert|6000|m|adj=on[/tpl] col. Mountaineers considered the easiest route to its summit was via Siula Grande's summit and it was so conquered by Manfred Sturm's 1966 expedition.[tpl]sfn|Sturm|1967|p=324[/tpl] Spanish alpinists Jordi Corominas and Oriol Baro made the first ascent of Chico's west face, and second ascent of the peak, in May 2007.[tpl]sfn|Lambert|2007[/tpl]
