===Limited services===

Midland Mainline operated a limited service between St Pancras and Leeds, with three early morning departures from Leeds and four evening return trips from St Pancras. This was principally because Midland Mainline's HSTs were maintained at Neville Hill depot. The timings did not compare favourably with the principal service from London King's Cross to Leeds along the East Coast Main Line with the Midland Main Line having a much slower line speed. The journey time on the Midland route is around 3 hours 15 minutes vs 2 hours 15 minutes via the East Coast."MML serves 6 new stations" Rail Magazine issue 355 21 April 1999 page 355
In July 1996 a bus service between Kettering and Corby was introduced."MML re-launches" Railway Magazine October 1996 page 8
From May 1999 a small number of through trains from St Pancras to Burton upon Trent and Barnsley were introduced as well as stops at Belper and Meadowhall.
From May 2000 through trains between St Pancras and Matlock were introduced, ceasing in December 2004 when Class 222s were introduced, as they were not allowed on the Derwent Valley Line branch line."Midland Mainline run to Scarborough this summer" Rail Magazine issue 384 14 June 2000 page 4"Mistimed, daunting...but still a top table" Rail Magazine issue 502 8 December 2004 page 36 Also in May 2000 Midland Mainline began operating one Saturday service between St Pancras and York via Doncaster. In summer it would continue to Scarborough. On Sunday a service to York started at Leicester, with the return service being via the Erewash Valley Line to Nottingham, where it reversed before proceeding to St Pancras.
A small number of trains operated between St Pancras and Sheffield via Nottingham and along the Erewash Valley Line to Chesterfield serving Langley Mill and Alfreton.

==Project Rio==

From May 2003 until September 2004 Midland Mainline operated an hourly service between St Pancras and Manchester Piccadilly at the request of the Strategic Rail Authority whilst the West Coast Main Line between London Euston and Manchester underwent engineering work using former Virgin CrossCountry High Speed Trains.Project Rio: Network Licence Conditions 12 and 13 - Consent of the Regulator Office of the Rail Regulator 16 May 2003Privatisation 1993 - 2005 125 Group This service was named Project Rio after footballer Rio Ferdinand who had recently crossed the Pennines in a Â£30 million record transfer to from Leeds United to Manchester United.
The service used the Midland Main Line as far as Trent Junction, before taking the Erewash Valley Line (avoiding Derby) to Clay Cross, rejoining the Midland Main Line until Dore South Curve, before heading west along the Hope Valley Line towards Manchester Piccadilly. South of Leicester the service ran in the path of the xx:30 semi-fast Nottingham train, with an additional Leicester to Nottingham service introduced using the displaced Class 170 Turbostar.

==Rolling stock==

Midland Mainline inherited a fleet of High Speed Trains from British Rail. Enhancements were carried out to the power cars of the HSTs, most notably a revised lighting cluster.
In April 1997 Midland Mainline ordered 13 (later extended to 17) Class 170 Turbostars to operate stopping services.[tpl]cite web|url=http://production.investis.com/nx/oc/rfi/afa/oc_1997/1997-10-14|title=14 October 1997 - Midland Mainline orders more trains|date=October 14, 1997|publisher=National Express[/tpl] Originally all were ordered as two-carriage sets before it was decided to increase 10 to three-carriage sets. The first entered service in May 1999 and allowed a new timetable with increased frequencies to be introduced with the Class 170s operating most of the all stops south of Leicester, allowing the High Speed Trains to be better used on the longer distance services.
To cover for a shortage of High Speed Trains Midland Mainline hired two Fragonset Class 47s to top and tail a HSBC Rail Mark 2 set on a morning service from Nottingham to St Pancras and evening return to Sheffield from February 2002.Rail Magazine issue 430 6 March 2002 page 12 In October 2002 Midland Mainline was able to replace these after leasing an additional five Class 43s and two sets of Mark 3 carriages that had been released by Virgin CrossCountry.Rail Magazine issue 447 30 October 2002 page 55
In February 2002 Midland Mainline ordered sixteen four-carriage and seven nine-carriage Class 222 Meridian trains based on the Virgin CrossCountry Class 220 Voyager, but with developments to improve passenger comfort and address some of the criticisms aimed at the Voyager.Rail firm orders 23 new trains BBC News 14 February 2002 The first entered service in May 2004.Rail Magazine issue 489 9 June 2004 page 6 The four-carriage sets were to replace the Class 170 Turbostars while the nine-carriage sets were ordered to operate a new service from St Pancras to Leeds via Nottingham and the Erewash Valley Line.
After the Strategic Rail Authority decided the Leeds service could no longer be justified it appeared that the nine-carriage units may have been used elsewhere.New train fleet left sitting idle BBC News 29 October 2004Rail Magazine issue 485 14 April 2004 page 12 Eventually they did begin to enter service from July 2005 releasing one HST for hire to First Great Western while it refurbished its fleet and others to GNER, ironically to let it run extra services to Leeds from May 2007.Class 222 Meridian / Pioneer Railway UK website In 2006/07 the nine-carriage sets each had one carriage removed and inserted into a four-carriage set.
To operate the Project Rio services to Manchester Piccadilly, 23 Class 43s and associated Mark 3 carriages were transferred from Virgin CrossCountry in May 2003.Rail Magazine issue 465 9 July 2003 page 40 Whilst these were undergoing overhaul, a First Great Western High Speed Train was hired from May 2003 until February 2004.Rail Magazine issue 463 11 June 2003 age 406 When Project Rio concluded in September 2004, some were transferred to First Great Western and GNER, others went into store.
