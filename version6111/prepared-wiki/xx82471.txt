In mathematics, Cartan's theorems A and B are two results proved by Henri Cartan around 1951, concerning a coherent sheaf [tpl]mvar|F[/tpl] on a Stein manifold [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl]. They are significant both as applied to several complex variables, and in the general development of sheaf cohomology.
Theorem B is stated  in cohomological terms (a formulation that Cartan (1953, p.51) attributes to J.-P. Serre):
Analogous properties were established by Serre (1955) for coherent sheaves in algebraic geometry, when [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] is an affine scheme. The analogue of Theorem B in this context is as follows [tpl]harv|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Theorem III.3.7[/tpl]:
These theorems have many important applications.  Naively, they imply that a holomorphic function on a closed complex submanifold, [tpl]mvar|Z[/tpl], of a Stein manifold [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] can be extended to a holomorphic function on all of [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl]. At a deeper level, these theorems were used by Jean-Pierre Serre to prove the GAGA theorem.
Theorem B is sharp in the sense that if [tpl]math|Hâ€‰1(X, F) [tpl]=[/tpl] 0[/tpl] for all coherent sheaves [tpl]mvar|F[/tpl] on a complex manifold [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] (resp. quasi-coherent sheaves [tpl]mvar|F[/tpl] on a noetherian scheme [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl]), then [tpl]mvar|X[/tpl] is Stein (resp. affine); see  Serre (1952) (resp. Serre (1957) and Hartshorne|1977|loc=Theorem III.3.7).
