Airliners is an American magazine dedicated to the airline industry. Six issues are circulated each year. The title was first published by World Transport Press in 1988. Since the 100th issue (July/August 2006) it has been produced by Airliners Publications, LLC.
The magazine includes articles about the world of commercial aircraft and air carriers, including new low cost airlines, changes at legacy companies, jetliners such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 787, trips around the world, historical airlines, adventurous flights, airliner crashes and pictures of airliner liveries.
Featured authors include John Adlard, Sebastian Schmitz, Dave Nichols, Ben Wang, Bill Hough, Joel Chusid, Royal King, Robbie Shaw, and Cody Diamond. Photographers contribute images of airlines, aircraft, personnel, facilities and operations.
The magazine's first editor was John Wegg. Subsequent editors were Bryant Pettit, Nick Veronico, Jon Proctor, David Kaufman and Jay Selman. Starting with the November/December 2007 issue, the editor was Dwayne Darnell. On December 11, 2009, Darnell announced that he was leaving, and that designer/Creative Director Robert Christensen would lead the magazine.
In 2010, Robert Christensen initiated a series of online initiatives, releasing e-book formats of the print magazine and establishing a social media presence. Popular components of past issues such as the Air Photo News section are being returned to the magazine's pages.
