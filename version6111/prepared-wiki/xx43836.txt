</ref> Centaurs typically behave with characteristics of both [[asteroid]]s and [[comets]]. They are named after the mythological beings that were a mixture of [[horse]] and [[human]], [[centaur]]s. It has been estimated that there are around 44,000 centaurs in the [[Solar System]] with diameters larger than 1&nbsp;km.<ref name=Horner2004a/>
The first centaur to be discovered was 944 Hidalgo in 1920. However, they were not recognized as a distinct population until the discovery of 2060 Chiron in 1977. The largest confirmed centaur is 10199 Chariklo, which at 260 km in diameter is as big as a mid-sized main-belt asteroid, and is known to have a system of rings.  It was discovered in 1997.  However, the lost centaur, [tpl]mpl|1995 SN|55[/tpl], may be somewhat larger.
No centaur has been photographed up close, although there is evidence that Saturn's moon Phoebe, imaged by the Cassini probe in 2004, may be a captured centaur. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope has gleaned some information about the surface features of 8405 Asbolus.
[tpl]As of|2008[/tpl], three centaurs have been found to display cometary comas: Chiron, 60558 Echeclus, and 166P/NEAT. Chiron and Echeclus are therefore classified as both asteroids and comets. Other centaurs such as 52872 Okyrhoe are suspected of showing cometary activity. Any centaur that is perturbed close enough to the Sun is expected to become a comet.

==Classification==

The generic definition of a centaur is a small body that orbits the Sun between Jupiter and Neptune and crosses the orbits of one or more of the giant planets. Due to the inherent long-term instability of orbits in this region, even centaurs such as [tpl]mpl|2000 GM|137[/tpl] and [tpl]mpl|2001 XZ|255[/tpl], which do not currently cross the orbit of any planet, are in gradually changing orbits that will be perturbed until they start to cross the orbit of one or more of the giant planets.
However, different institutions have different criteria for classifying borderline objects, based on particular values of their orbital elements:

The collection The Solar System Beyond Neptune (2008) uses the traditional definition of centaurs, limited to semi-major axes smaller than that of Neptune, classifying the objects on unstable orbits beyond this limit as members of the scattered disc.  Yet, other astronomers still prefer to define centaurs as objects that are non-resonant with a perihelion inside the orbit of Neptune that can be shown to likely cross the Hill sphere of a gas giant within the next 10 million years.[ref]
</ref>  Thus centaurs can be thought of as inward scattered objects that interact more aggressively and scatter more quickly than typical scattered disc objects.
The JPL Small-Body Database lists 183 centaurs.[ref]
