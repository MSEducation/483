==Electronic colonialism==

McPhail has published over 90 articles and several books, including the widely translated Global Communication: Theories, Stakeholders, and Trends.

In 2009 he published with Wiley-Blackwell a book on development communication.
He now serves as a media and internet analyst for many media outlets including AP, UPI, USAToday, Toronto Star, Ottawa Citizen, NPR/PBS, Financial Post, and the New York Times.
