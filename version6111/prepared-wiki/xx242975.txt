==Coral Sea oil spill==

As MV Pacific Adventurer, the vessel was sailing from Newscastle to the Port of Brisbane. During rough seas created by Cyclone Hamish 230 tonnes of fuel oil, 30 tonnes of other fuel and 31 shipping containers (620 tonnes) of ammonium nitrate spilled into the Coral Sea, off the coast from Cape Moreton. 100,000 litres of oil washed up on the coasts of Queensland resulting in the area being declared a disaster zone by Premier Anna Bligh.
The leak was contained before reaching Hamilton Wharf in Brisbane, the nearest port. The ship then leaked oil while docked in the Brisbane River which caused another 500 m long oil slick.
After the Australian Maritime Safety Authority inspected the ship and declared her seaworthy it left Brisbane in April 2009 with a new captain at the helm.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/04/16/2544513.htm |title=Pacific Adventurer leaves Brisbane |author=Stephanie Smail |accessdate=2009-10-20 |date=16 April 2009 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation [/tpl] In August 2009 the ships owners agreed to pay $25 million compensation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/12/2683970.htm |title=Businesses still battling after Pacific Adventurer oil spill |date=12 September 2009 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |accessdate=14 July 2010[/tpl] Totals costs for cleaning up after the spill reached $34 million.
