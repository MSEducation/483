===Critical response===

Paolo Lagazzi,Paolo Lagazzi (it) literary critic, wrote about Reali's sense of modern life, calling it "the whipping up tsunami of chaos".
About L'anima corrotta, Lagazzi wrote: "The voice of the poet points to the corruption of the soul as origin, before the modernity sin, but he reminds us that the amazement and the beauty will be able to opposite to it until the extreme". Introducing L'uomo a quanti, Lagazzi observed "an energy that can overthrow the common categories of thought". The poet and literary critic Giancarlo BaroniGiancarlo Baroni (it) identified the theme of the book with "moving forward the horizon, taking it as a movable frontier, not a barrier; the needs - that cannot be renounced - to look elsewhere, to avert being enmeshed and caged, limited and compressed; the need to avert surrender".[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
When A Tired Angel was published in 2011, Lagazzi presented the book saying that "Mario Lucrezio Reali ... with his harsh and energetic wisdom has soon become one of the most gifted among the new Italian poets ... few contemporary authors know how to exploit so radically the ambiguity of language in order to dig into the old history of Western civilization".[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
