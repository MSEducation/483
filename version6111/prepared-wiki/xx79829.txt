==Biography==

Fernández was born in Buenos Aires, where he would later attend Law School at the University of Buenos Aires. He graduated at the age of 24, and later became a professor of criminal law there. He entered public service as an adviser to Deliberative Council of Buenos Aires and the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. He later as Deputy Director of Legal Affairs of the Economy Ministry, and in this capacity served as chief Argentine negotiator at the GATT Uruguay Round. Nominated by newly elected President Carlos Menem to serve as National Superintendent for Insurance, served as President of the Latin American Insurance Managers' Association from 1989 to 1992, and co-founded the Insurance Managers International Association. He also served as adviser to Mercosur and ALADI on insurance law, and was involved in insurance and health services companies in the private sector. Fernández was named one of the Ten Outstanding Young People of Argentina in 1992, and was awarded the Millennium Award as one of the nation's Businessmen of the Century, among other recognitions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fices.unsl.edu.ar/novedades/albertofernandez.htm|title=Clase Magistral|work=Univerdsidad Nacional de San Luis[/tpl] During this time he became politically close to former Buenos Aires Province Governor Eduardo Duhalde.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0181/articulo.php?art=1491&ed=185|title=El Pasado Menemista de un gobierno que acusa a la oposición de menemista|work=Perfil[/tpl] 
He was elected on June 7, 2000, to the Buenos Aires City Legislature on the conservative Acción por la República ticket led by former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. He gave up his seat when he was appointed Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers by President Néstor Kirchner upon taking office on May 25, 2003, and retained the same post under Kirchner's wife and successor, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, upon her election in 2007. His marriage suffered during this interim due to infidelity on his part, and in 2005 he and his wife separated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agencianova.com/nota.asp?n=2005_3_22&id=21393&id_tiponota=5|title=Alberto Fernández habría vuelto con su esposa|work=Agencia Nova[/tpl] He later began a relationship with Congresswoman Vilma Ibarra.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2011/04/11/noticia_0030.html|title=Alberto Fernández y Vilma Ibarra más juntos que nunca|work=Perfil[/tpl] 
A new system of variable taxes on agricultural exports led to the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector, during which Fernández acted as the government's chief negotiator. The negotiations failed, however, and following Vice President Julio Cobos' surprise, tie-breaking vote against the bill in the Seante, Fernández resigned on July 23, 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2008/7/23/un-371171.asp|title=Miguens afirmó que Fernández fracasó en la negociación con el campo|work=Los Andes[/tpl] He was named head of the City of Buenos Aires chapter of the Justicialist Party, but minimized his involvement in Front for Victory campaigns for Congress in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2009/06/16/elpais/p-01939932.htm|title=Kirchner cargó contra Cobos y De Narváez en un acto porteño|work=Clarín[/tpl] Fernández actively considered seeking the Justicialist Party presidential nomination ahead of the 2011 general elections.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1246878-alberto-fernandez-reitero-que-no-descarta-ser-candidato-a-presidente-en-2011|title=Alberto Fernández reiteró que no descarta ser candidato a presidente en 2011|work=La Nación[/tpl] He ultimately endorsed President Cristina Kirchner for re-election, however.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1401861-alberto-fernandez-se-declara-oficialista-y-ya-se-anota-como-candidato-para-el-2015|title=Alberto Fernández se declara oficialista y ya se anota como candidato para 2015|work=La Nación[/tpl]
