[[Ulmus glabra 'Lutescens']]

CATEGORIES: Elm cultivars

The Golden Wych Elm, Ulmus glabra Lutescens, is arguably the best of the golden elm cultivars as it keeps its colour as it ages.

==Description==

A medium-sized, fast-growing deciduous tree that reaches a height of approximately 15 metres with a spread of about 20 metres. In its first years, the tree is vase-shaped, but spreads as it matures to form a rounded canopy. The hue of the leaves varies according to light intensity. Ergo: where exposed to full sunlight the leaves are bright yellow, but in shade no more than a lime green.

==Pests and diseases==

The cultivar is not known to be any less susceptible to Dutch elm disease than the species.
