TSJ Media, also known as TSJ News Inc. and the Spanish Journal Network, is a chain of bilingual weekly newspapers, monthly magazines, and Spanish-language radio stations based in Cincinnati, Ohio, that serves Hispanic communities in several metropolitan areas of the United States.

==History==

The media company was founded in 1999 as the monthly broadsheet newspaper The Spanish Journal ([tpl]lang-es|La Jornada Latina[/tpl]), which was published in Cincinnati. In 2006, TSJ News was bought by Blue Ash, Ohio–based Gate West Coast Ventures, LLC, which also owns the translation company Strategic Spanish. As a division of Gate West Coast, TSJ expanded to several other markets in the Midwestern United States.[tpl]cite news|title=Spanish-language TSJ News hopes adding radio boosts profitability|first=Dan|last=Monk|work=Cincinnati Business Courier|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=2009-06-22|accessdate=2011-08-28|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2009/06/22/story10.html[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Spanish-language publisher takes over business operations at WVKO|first=Kevin|last=Kemper|work=Columbus Business First|publisher=American City Business Journals|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/2009/06/22/story9.html|date=2009-06-22[/tpl]

==Publications==

TSJ's print publications are centrally produced in Cincinnati, while ads are sold by local staff. For the most part, TSJ publication are written in Spanish, although some sections may be written in English for ESL students.
The Spanish Journal Network also once published La Jornada Atlanta Empleos, which was distributed for free in Atlanta.

==Broadcasting==

In September 2001, the Spanish Journal Network briefly experimented with a weekly radio talk show on Christian radio station WTSJ 1050 AM (now WGRI), called Noticiero Latino–Radio en Español, but the show was cancelled on December 26, 2005, for financial reasons.
After launching an information-by-telephone service (iNFO-TELEFONO) and converting the newspaper from a monthly publication to a weekly one, the Spanish Journal Network resumed broadcasts of Radio en Español in Spring 2005 on WDBZ 1230 AM, airing each Sunday with six hours of programming."No se vayan, que esto se pone bueno..!"
