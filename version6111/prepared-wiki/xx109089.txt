Winters was cast in the ABC drama pilot Happy Town, from the creators of October Road, but was replaced by Steven Weber after shooting the pilot.[tpl]cite web|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i2f1cb016d0c1784492ced5f59ee6542e |title=Slew of pilots flesh out casts |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=2009-02-22 |accessdate=2010-05-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/guide.aspx?id=in_and_out |title=Guide | publisher=TheFutonCritic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-20[/tpl]
On June 20, 2010, Winters was introduced as "Mayhem," the recurring character in a new television and radio advertising campaign for  Allstate Insurance created by the agency Leo Burnett Chicago.  The campaign is centered around the idea that paying too little for insurance could result in customers not getting the best coverage or service for their money.  In an analysis of the 15-second teaser spots, Stuart Elliott, advertising columnist of The New York Times, called Mayhem "a throwback to a kind of ad character that was once hugely popular: the bad guy who causes problems that the product being advertised solves," comparing Winters' character to the Noid in ads for Domino's Pizza in the 1980s, or the Spotmaker in early Calgonite ads.[tpl]cite web|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/business/media/21adco.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1277229613-4DbSb9o7s3XCRQZvEn+TdQ|title=Allstate Adds Villain, With Car Insurance as the Hero|publisher=nytimes.com|date=2010-06-20|accessdate=2010-06-22[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Around June 19, 2009, after shooting the Happy Town pilot, Winters contracted a bacterial infection and collapsed upon arrival at his doctor's office, and while being transported across Central Park in an ambulance, Winters' heart stopped beating for 2Â½ minutes.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/rock_star_back_from_dead_96z58EnG673W9mg08N2ZpL|title=Dean Winters' amazing journey back from death|work=New York Post|date=June 18, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2012[/tpl] Paramedics were able to revive him, and Winters was hospitalized in intensive care for three weeks.
Over the course of the next year, Winters developed gangrene, requiring the amputation of two toes and half of one thumb and ten subsequent operations including a skin graft.  Aside from being replaced by Weber when the pilot was picked up for series production, Winters was away from acting until the spring of 2010, when Tina Fey brought him back to 30 Rock and he started work on the Mayhem campaign.
