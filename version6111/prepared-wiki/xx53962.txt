Druk tsendhen ("The Thunder Dragon Kingdom") is the national anthem of Bhutan.
Adopted in 1953, the music is by Aku Tongmi and the words are by Dasho Gyaldun Thinley.[tpl]cite book|title=Hrvatska Enciklopedija |volume=1 |first=Dalibor |last=Brozović |publisher=Miroslav Krleža |year=1999 |isbn=953-6036-29-0 |page=569 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ewUTAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=2011-10-29[/tpl] Tongmi was educated in India and had recently been appointed leader of the military brass band when the need for an anthem rose at the occasion of a state visit from Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India. His original score was inspired by the Bhutanese folk tune "The Unchanging Lotus Throne" (Thri nyampa med pa pemai thri). The melody has twice undergone changes by Tongmi's successors as band leaders. The original lyrics were 12 lines, but was shortened to the present six-line version in 1964 by a secretary to the king.[tpl]cite book|title=The Origin and Description of The National Flag and National Anthem of The Kingdom of Bhutan |first1=Dorji |last1=Penjore |first2=Sonam |last2=Kinga |publisher=The Centre for Bhutan Studies |location=Thimphu |year=2002 |url=http://www.bhutanstudies.org.bt/pubFiles/nationalflag.pdf |format=PDF |page=14 |isbn=99936-14-01-7 |accessdate=2011-04-19[/tpl]
As the anthem is inspired by a folk tune, there is a choreography to it as well, originally directed by Tongmi.[tpl]cite book|title=Independence Days: Holidays and Celebrations |first=Amy Hackney |last=Blackwell |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=1-60413-101-2 |page=15 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QMyL9Dpp378C |accessdate=2011-10-29[/tpl]
