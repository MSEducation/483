"DEATHS. At Newtown, Conn. Hon. WILLIAM EDMONDS, aged 83 years. The deceased was engaged in the Revolutionary war, in which he was wounded: he was admitted to the bar in 1780 : in 1798 he was elected a Representative in Congress, was re-elected in 1800, and at the commencement of the second session of that Congress he resigned his seat and returned to the practice of his profession, in which he continued with marked success until 1805, when he was elected one of the Judges of the Supreme Court. He continued to hold this office until the adoption of the Constitution of his State. The number of Judges was then reduced from nine to five, and the deceased, with several other members of the Court, retired to private life."
