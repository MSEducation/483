An entheogen ("generating the divine within")[tpl]citation |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/entheogen | title=Entheogen | publisher=dictionary.com |accessdate=2012-03-13[/tpl] is a psychoactive substance used in a religious, shamanic, or spiritual context. Entheogens have been used in a ritualized context for thousands of years; their religious significance is well established in anthropological and modern evidences. Examples of traditional entheogens include: peyote, psilocybin mushrooms, uncured tobacco, cannabis, ayahuasca, Salvia divinorum, Tabernanthe iboga, Ipomoea tricolor, and Amanita muscaria.
Shamans will often observe dietary or customary restrictions particular to their tradition.  These restrictions are more than just cultural. For example, the diet followed by shamans and apprentices prior to participating in an ayahuasca ceremony includes foods rich in tryptophan (a biosynthetic precursor to serotonin) as well as avoiding foods rich in tyramine, which could induce hypertensive crisis if ingested with MAOIs such as are found in ayahuasca brews as well as abstinence from alcohol or sex.

===Music, songs===

Just like shamanism itself, music and songs related to it in various cultures are diverse, far from being alike. In several instances,  songs related to shamanism are intended to imitate natural sounds, via onomatopoeia.Hoppál 2006c: 143
Sound mimesis in various cultures may serve other functions not necessarily related to shamanism: practical goals as luring game in the hunt; or entertainment (Inuit throat singing).Nattiez: 5Deschênes 2002

===Paraphernalia===

Shamans may have various kinds of paraphernalia in different cultures.

===Cognitive, semiotic, hermeneutic approaches===

As mentioned, a (debated) approach explains the etymology of word "shaman" as meaning "one who knows".Diószegi 1962:  13Hoppál 2005: 14 Really, the shaman is a person who is an expert in keeping together the multiple codes of the society.  Accordingly, the society's codes are the manifestation of the society's underlying complex belief system.  Thus to be effective, shamans maintain a comprehensive view in their mind which gives them certainty of knowledge.Hoppál 2005: 15 The shaman uses (and the audience understands) multiple codes. Shamans express meanings in many ways: verbally, musically, artistically, and in dance. Meanings may be manifested in objects such as amulets.
The shaman knows the culture of his or her community well,Pentikäinen 1995: 270Hoppál 2005: 25–26,43 and acts accordingly. Thus, their audience knows the used symbols and meanings—that is why shamanism can be efficient: people in the audience trust it.  For example, the shaman's drumming can appear to its members as certainty of knowledge—this explains the above described etymology for the word "shaman" as meaning "one who knows."Hoppál 2004: 14
There are semiotic theoretical approaches to shamanism,Hoppál 2005: 13–15, 58, 197Hoppál 2006a: 11Hoppál 2006b: 175 ("ethnosemiotics"). The symbols on the shaman's costume and drum can refer to Power animals, or to the rank of the shaman.
There are also examples of "mutually opposing symbols", distinguishing a "white" shaman who contacts sky spirits for good aims by day, from a "black" shaman who contacts evil spirits for bad aims by night.Hoppál 2007c: 24–25 (Series of such opposing symbols referred to a world-view behind them. Analogously to the way grammar arranges words to express meanings and convey a world, also this formed a cognitive map?).Hoppál, Mihály: Nature worship in Siberian shamanism Shaman's lore is rooted in the folklore of the community, which provides a "mythological mental map".Hoppál 2007b: 12–13Hoppál 2007c: 25 Juha Pentikäinen uses the concept "grammar of mind".Pentikäinen 1995: 270–271 Linking to a Sami example, Kathleen Osgood Dana writes:
Armin Geertz coined and introduced the hermeneutics,Merkur 1985: v "ethnohermeneutics", approaches to the practice of interpretation.  Hoppál extended the term to include not only the interpretation of oral and written texts, but that of "visual texts as well (including motions, gestures and more complex ritual, and ceremonies performed for instance by shamans)".Hoppál 2007b: 13 It not only reveals the animistic views hiding behind shamanism, but also conveys their relevance for the contemporary world, where ecological problems have validated paradigms about balance and protection.

===Ecological approaches, systems theory===

Other fieldworks use systems theory concepts and ecological considerations to understand the shaman's lore. Desana and Tucano Indians have developed a sophisticated symbolism and concepts of "energy" flowing between people and animals in cyclic paths. Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff relates these concepts to developments in the ways that modern science (systems theory, ecology, new approaches in anthropology and archeology) treats causality in a less linear fashion. He also suggests a cooperation of modern science and indigenous lore (onlineGerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff: A View from the Headwaters. The Ecologist, Vol. 29 No. 4, July 1999.).

===Hypotheses on origins===

Shamanic practices may originate as early as the Paleolithic, predating all organized religions,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/clottes/page7.php |title=Shamanism in Prehistory |author=Jean Clottes |accessdate=2008-03-11 |work=Bradshaw foundation [/tpl][ref]
