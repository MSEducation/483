==Plot summary==

In 1850 San Francisco, Russian Countess Marina Selanova (Ann Blyth) flees from an arranged marriage to Prince Semyon (Carl Esmond). She books passage with "Portugee" (Anthony Quinn) to Sitka, where her uncle Governor Ivan Vorashilov (Sig Ruman) can protect her.
When Portugee's bitter rival, Captain Jonathan Clark „The Boston-man“ (Gregory Peck), frees his shanghaied crew, she sends a man to negotiate with him instead. However, Jonathan hates all Russians and turns down the offer. In desperation, Marina goes to the party he is throwing and, pretending to be the Countess's companion, gets him to change his mind. As he shows her the sights of the city in one whirlwind night, they fall in love. Jonathan proposes marriage and she gladly accepts.
However, Prince Semyon finds Marina and takes her to Sitka. Believing Marina has tricked him, Jonathan races Portugee to Alaska, recklessly wagering his ship on who gets there first. Jonathan wins, but that doesn't stop Portugee from trying to steal his ship anyway. Unluckily, while both crews are brawling, a Russian gunboat appears and takes them all captive to Sitka.
Once there, Prince Semyon forces Marina to agree to marry him in return for Jonathan's freedom. Jonathan and his men double back, rescue Marina, and sail away.
