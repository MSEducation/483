==Background==

The music of "Almeno tu nell'universo" was composed in 1974 by Italian songwriter Maurizio Fabrizio. During the same year, Bruno Lauzi was asked to write the lyrics for the song, and he completed "Almeno tu nell'universo" in thirty minutes. The authors of the song immediately asked Mia Martini to record the song, but she refused it.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2010/07/02/spoleto-sul-palco-roby-facchinetti-per-rifare.html|work=la Repubblica|language=Italian|date=2 July 2010|title=Spoleto, sul palco Roby Facchinetti per rifare la storia del pop italiano|author=Carlo Moretti|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl] However, in 1989 Martini recorded the song for the album Martini Mia, which marked her comeback after several years.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1989/03/23/nuova-avventura-musicale-dalla-voce-di-martini.html|work=la Repubblica|language=Italian|date=23 March 1989|title=Nuova avventura musicale dalla voce di Martini Mia|author=Ernesto Assante[/tpl] The song was also submitted to the artistic committee of the 39th Sanremo Music Festival and, in January 1989, was chosen as one of the 24 entries of the main competition,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1989/01/31/voila-sanremo-89-ce.html|work=la Repubblica|language=Italian|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=31 January 1989|title=Voilà, Sanremo '89, ce n'è per tutti i gusti[/tpl] where it placed ninth, receiving the Critics' Award which was later entitled to Mia Martini herself.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://cinquantamila.corriere.it/storyTellerGiorno.php?year=1989&month=02&day=25|work=Corriere della Sera|language=Italian|accessdate=12 August 2013|title=Le notizie del 25 Febbraio 1989|date=25 February 1989[/tpl]
