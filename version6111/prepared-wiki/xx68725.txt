File:PATH to scale.svg|To-scale map of the PATH system

PATH operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. During regular hours, PATH operates four train services, using three terminals in New Jersey and two in Manhattan. Each line is represented by a unique color, which also corresponds to the color of the lights on the front of the trains. The Journal Square – 33rd Street (via Hoboken) service is the only line represented by two colors (orange and blue), since it is a late-night hours combination of the Journal Square – 33rd Street and Hoboken – 33rd Street services.
PATH management has two principal passenger outreach initiatives: the "PATHways" newsletter, distributed free at terminals, and the Patron Advisory Committee.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey – PATH[tpl]Dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pathrail.com/CommutingTravel/path/html/patron.php |title=PATH Rapid-Transit System |accessdate=October 27, 2008 |quote=The Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH) was established in 1962 as a subsidiary of The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The heavy rail transit system serves as the primary transit link between Manhattan and neighboring New Jersey urban communities and suburban railroads. PATH presently carries 242,000 passengers each weekday. This volume is expected to continue to increase with the anticipated growth in regional residential, commercial and business development. |publisher=The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey [/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl]

===Services===

Between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Monday to Friday, and all-day Saturday, Sunday, and holidays, PATH operates two train services:
Prior to April 9, 2006, Hoboken – World Trade Center and Journal Square – 33rd Street services were offered on Saturday, Sunday, and holidays between 9:00 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. Ongoing construction of the permanent World Trade Center Station in Manhattan prompted the indefinite discontinuation of these services on those times, being replaced with the Journal Square – 33rd Street (via Hoboken) service. Passengers traveling from Hoboken to the World Trade Center must take the Journal Square – 33rd Street service to Grove Street and transfer to the Newark – World Trade Center train.
PATH does not normally operate directly from Newark to Midtown Manhattan. However, after 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy, a special Newark – 33rd Street service was operated to compensate for the loss of other lines and stations. The post-9/11 service from 2001 to 2003 used the red line color of the Newark – World Trade Center service on the PATH system map, while the post-Sandy service of 2012–13 used the yellow color of the Journal Square – 33rd Street service from which it was extended.

===Station listing===

There are currently 13 active PATH stations:

==Fares==

As of October 1, 2013,
Single ride tickets are valid for two hours from time of purchase.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/path/html/fares.html |title=Fares |accessdate=October 27, 2008 |quote= |publisher=The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822184654/http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/path/html/fares.html |archivedate = August 22, 2008[/tpl]

===Payment methods===

====Quick Cards====

On October 24, 2008, the Port Authority announced that as of November 30, 2008, NJ Transit ticket machines on NJ Transit stations will no longer sell the QuickCard and as of December 31, 2008, NJ Transit ticket machines in PATH stations (Newark, Hoboken, Journal Square, Exchange Place, and Pavonia -Newport) will no longer sell the cards. The machines at the 33rd Street, Grove Street and WTC stations were removed earlier in 2008.http://www.panynj.gov/AboutthePortAuthority/PressCenter/PressReleases/PressRelease/index.php?id=1142 [tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]
By the third quarter of 2008, PATH had completed the inactivation of all turnstiles that accepted cash (in addition to the QuickCard, MetroCard and SmartLink card). These turnstiles will continue to accept the various cards as fare payment.
In 2010, PATH introduced a two-trip card costing $4.00 using the standard MetroCard form. Vending machines selling this card are in major PATH stations including 33rd St, World Trade Center and Journal Square. The front of the card is the standard MetroCard (gold and blue) but on the reverse it has the text "PATH 2-Trip Card", "Valid for two (2) PATH trips only" and "No refills on this card".
The user had to dispose of the card after the trips are used up because the turnstiles do not keep (or capture) the card as was done with the discontinued QuickCard.
At the end of 2010, the QuickCard was discontinued and replaced with the SmartLink Gray card which is a non-refillable, disposable version of the SmartLink card. This card is sold at selected newsstand vendors and is available in 10, 20 and 40 trips. Unlike the regular SmartLink cards, the SmartLink Gray cards will have an expiration date.

====SmartLink====

The Port Authority installed new fare collection turnstiles at all PATH stations in 2005 and 2006. These turnstiles allowed passengers to pay their fare with a PATH QuickCard or an MTA Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard — and, as of 2007, with a smart card, known as SmartLink. The project is part of a Port Authority project to implement usage of a regional smart card that could be used on transit systems throughout the New York metropolitan area. The new turnstile program first began at the World Trade Center station. Until their discontinuance in December 2010, PATH QuickCards were only valid on the PATH rail system.
In the fall of 2005, PATH and the MTA installed a number of MetroCard Vending Machines (MVM) on the concourse at the World Trade Center station and at the 30th Street entrance of the 33rd Street station. By the summer of 2006, MVMs were installed in all stations. These machines sell Pay-Per-Ride MetroCards and allow riders to refill SmartLink cards once they are introduced in 2007. In addition, these machines sell Single Ride PATH tickets for use only on the PATH system.
The initial testing phase of the SmartLink system was delayed by several months due to software problems. It was originally intended to start in August 2006 and then was postponed to October 2006. Continuing problems moved the testing phase for Senior SmartLink cards to February 2007.
The week of July 2, 2007, PATH began an initial roll out of the SmartLink card to the general public at the World Trade Center station. On July 23 the card was introduced at the 33rd Street terminal. On August 6 the card was introduced at the Hoboken terminal. Special vending machines that sold an 11-trip SmartLink card were installed at terminal stations. The cost of the card at $20 which includes 11 trips plus a $5 charge for the card. In 2008 when the fare was increased to $1.75, these machines were upgraded to sell an $18 card which included 10 trips at $1.30 plus the $5.00 card fee. Also a machine selling just the card for $5.00 was installed. The cards can be registered online, allowing riders to retain unused trips in case the card is lost or stolen. A charge of $5 is assessed for a replacement card.[tpl]cite news | last =Marsico | first =Ron | title =Lower Manhattan now offers PATH to a smarter commute | publisher =The Star-Ledger | date =July 4, 2007 | url =http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/jersey/index.ssf?/base/news-7/1183523560182920.xml&coll=1 | accessdate = July 10, 2007 [/tpl] In 2011, the card was $20 ($15 for 10 trips + $5 for card) In the initial stage, the SmartLink card will allow riders to place the same value on it as if they were purchasing a QuickCard by using machines located in PATH stations. A later stage will allow the rider to register the card to be automatically be refilled if the value on the card reaches a pre-set minimum. In June 2008, PATH inaugurated an online web account system allowing a cardholder to register the card and monitor its usage. It also allows for an automatic replenishment (linked to a credit card) when the card balance gets to 5 trips or 5 remaining days, depending on the type of trips on the card. Automatic replenishment is offered in 10-, 20-, and 40-trip increments, as well as weekly and monthly passes. Fares are the same as regular purchases.

===Planned fare increase===

As of October 1, 2014, a single PATH ride will rise to $2.75; two-trip tickets will be $5.50; 10-trip, $21; 20-trip, $42; 40-trip, $84 ($2.10 per trip); a seven-day unlimited, $29; and a 30-day unlimited, $89.

===Accessibility===

All terminals (33rd Street, Hoboken, World Trade Center, Journal Square and Newark) are wheelchair accessible, as are Exchange Place and Pavonia/Newport. The Port Authority's 2007–2016 Capital Plan has allocated over $17 million to renovate Grove Street, with a little over $750,000 allocated for 2007. The renovation will include compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. When completed, only five stations, Harrison in New Jersey and four of the stations along Sixth Avenue in New York City, will not be accessible to the disabled. Harrison will become accessible with the reconstruction scheduled for completion in April 2017.[tpl]cite news |title=Harrison hopes upgraded PATH station will help welcome commuters with a grand new view|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/harrison_hopes_upgraded_path_s.html|newspaper=The Star Ledger |location=Newark |date=April 5, 2012|accessdate=April 5, 2012[/tpl]

==Rolling stock==

PATH has a fleet of 350 that are in active revenue service. As of September 2011, there is only one model, the PA5. The cars are [tpl]convert|51|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] long, with a width of approximately [tpl]convert|9|ft|2+3/4|in|m|adj=on[/tpl]. They can achieve a maximum speed of [tpl]convert|55|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. Each car seats 35 passengers, on longitudinal seating, with a larger number of standees in each car.
PA5 cars have stainless steel bodies, and have three doors on each side. LCD displays above the windows (between the doors) display the destination of that particular train.
The Port Authority awarded a $499 million contract to Kawasaki to design and build 340 new PATH cars (called the PA5), which replaced the system's entire aging fleet. With an average age of 42 years, the fleet was the oldest of any operating heavy rail line in the United States. The Port Authority announced that the new cars would be updated versions of MTA's R142A cars, which are currently in service on the New York City Subway's 4 and 6 services. The first of these new cars entered revenue service July 10, 2009.New PATH Train Cars, MyFoxNY.com, published July 10, 2009, retrieved July 10, 200[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]
As part of the fleet expansion program and signal system upgrade, the Port Authority ordered a total of 119 additional PA5 cars as the option order. 44 of these cars were to expand the Newark – WTC line to 10-car operation while the remaining 75 cars were to be used to increase service intervals once Communication-based train control (CBTC) is implemented throughout the system in 2017.Go to side menu: PATH → Updated 2007–2016 Capital Plan Overview → PATH Cars[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===Current roster===

NOTES: On May 4, 2011, cab car 5741 ran into the bumper block of a yard tail track near Journal Square station. The car was back in service by June 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=3074149 |title=PATH 5741 |publisher=Rrpicturearchives.net |date=June 19, 2012 |accessdate=October 2, 2013[/tpl]

===Former roster===

The PA1 cars were built by St. Louis Car in 1965. PA2 cars were built in 1966–67, also by St. Louis. Hawker Siddeley built the PA3 cars in 1972. The PA4s were built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries in 1986–88.
PA1, PA2, and PA3 cars had painted aluminum bodies, and two doors on each side. Back-lit panels above the doors displayed the destination of that particular train: HOB for Hoboken, JSQ for Journal Square, NWK for Newark, 33 for 33rd Street, and WTC for World Trade Center. The MBTA's Blue and Orange Line cars, built in 1978–79 and 1980–81 respectively were based on the PA3. All PA1-PA3 cars were overhauled by Kawasaki in the mid 1980s. PA4 cars had stainless steel bodies, and three doors on each side. Back-lit displays above the windows (between the doors) displayed the destination of that particular train.
In 1972, PATH revived the tradition of naming its passenger cars. Each car was named after a community whose residents rely on PATH service to reach their destinations. Most of the municipalities were in New Jersey, but there were also a few from Rockland County, New York, along with New York City itself. Each end of the interior of a named car featured a brushed aluminum plaque bearing the name of the city or town along with a brief history and description of the area "today" (meaning in 1972), followed by the lines "This car is named in honor of (municipality name), one of more than 300 communities whose residents travel on the Port Authority Trans-Hudson interstate rail system."
All 4 were retired in 2011, with the PA4's remaining on site as work service cars.
NOTES: Cars 139, 143, 160, 612, 745, 750, 845 were left under the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and survived the collapse. They were stored out of service and stripped of usable parts. Several cars have been sent to the Smithsonian in Washington D.C.

==FRA railroad status==

While the PATH resembles a typical intraurban heavy rail rapid transit service, it is in fact a railroad under the jurisdiction of the Federal Railroad Administration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fra.dot.gov/us/content/886|title=Federal Railroad Administration: Passenger Rail; Chapter 1|accessdate=March 3, 2009[/tpl] PATH continues to be subject to FRA regulations because it used to share trackage with Pennsylvania Railroad in the section between Hudson interlocking near Harrison and Journal Square. In more recent past the line continued to have a connection to the Amtrak mainline near Harrison station and also near Hudson tower, but these connections have since been severed as the track layout at Hudson interlocking has been modified considerably. While the PATH does operate under a number of grandfather waivers, it is required to do things not typically seen on American transit systems. Some of these include the proper fitting of grab irons to all PATH rolling stock, the use of federally certified locomotive engineers, and compliance with the federal railroad hours of service regulations.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
While the PATH did once share trackage with the Pennsylvania Railroad, this joint running and all interlocking connections to the former rail lines have been cut, except for one diamond crossing on a siding near the Hudson tower. Due to its isolation from the national rail network, PATH could potentially end its status as a railroad. However, this railroad status might prove valuable if PATH were to extend service along existing rail routes as normally transit lines are required to either run on separate rights of way or time share with FRA railroads.
The PATH shares a similar status with the Staten Island Railway, which is also an FRA railroad running on a somewhat different waiver.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stationreporter.net/sir.htm|title=Staten Island Railway|author=David Paul Gerber|accessdate=February 24, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://nycsubway.org/lines/sirt.html|title=SIRT: Staten Island Rapid Transit|accessdate=February 25, 2009[/tpl]

==Signal upgrades==

In January 2010, Siemens announced that PATH would be spending $321 million to upgrade its signal system using Siemens' Trainguard MT CBTC to accommodate anticipated growth in ridership. The system will reduce the headway time between trains, so trains move more efficiently through the system and passenger wait times are reduced. Trainguard MT CBTC will equip the tracks and 130 of the 340 new EMU being constructed by Kawasaki Railcar. The goal is to increase passenger capacity from the current 240,000 passengers to 290,000 passengers per day. The entire system is expected to become operational in 2017.[tpl]cite news |title=Siemens venture signs $321M PATH rail deal |url=http://www.metro-magazine.com/News/Story/2010/01/Siemens-venture-signs-321M-PATH-rail-deal.aspx |newspaper=Metro Magazine |date=January 19, 2010 |accessdate=July 24, 2011[/tpl]PATH resignalling deal confirmed, railwaygazette.com, January 19, 2010
