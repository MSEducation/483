==History==

Vadheim is the resting place for one of the most famous warships of World War I. During that conflict, Germany converted a number of merchant ships in armed surface raiders. These ships cruised the world's shipping lanes and captured/sank Allied shipping. The most famous and successful of these was the SMS Möwe. One of the ships she sank was the Mount Temple which carried dinosaur skeletons destined for the British Museum in London, England.[tpl]Cite journal|title=The 1916 Sinking of the SS Mount Temple: Historical Perspectives on a Unique Aspect of Alberta's Paleontological Heritage.|last1=Tanke|first1=D.H.|last2=Hernes|first2=N.L.|last3=Guldberg|first3=T.E.|year=2002|journal=Canadian Paleobiology|volume=7|pages=5–26[/tpl]  The Möwe survived the war and was renamed several times over the next several decades. During World War II, she was renamed Oldenburg, and used in support of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. On 7 April 1945 Bristol Beaufighter aircraft from No. 114 Squadron RAF, No. 455 Squadron RAAF, and No. 489 Squadron RNZAF sank the Oldenburg at her moorings following an intense strafing and rocket attack.
Shortly after the end of World War II, the pre-war criminal and wartime resistance fighter Johannes S. Andersen broke into the German barracks in Vadheim and killed two German prisoners-of-war. The incident caused a controversy in Norway after the war when Andersen was charged in court with killing them. It was decided in 1947 that his indictment would be withdrawn.
Near Vadheim is Ytredal Bridge, an 18th-century stone bridge. It is a popular tourist attraction.
