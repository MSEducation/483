[[Magic club]]

CATEGORIES: Magic clubs

A magic club is any group of local magicians who meet together on a regular basis. Also sometimes known as a magic circle. A club can be open to all with an interest in magic or it may be only possible to join by invite or by meeting some sort of notability criteria (e.g. professional magicians only). Some clubs may specialize in types of magic, or be primarily youth oriented.
Most magic clubs will charge a fee for membership. Fees will vary from club to club, depending on what services are offered.
