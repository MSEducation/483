John Georgiades (born 3 January 1966) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for Footscray in the Australian Football League.
From WAFL club Subiaco, Georgiades was drafted by Footscray at number 35 at the 1988 VFL Draft. A forward, Georgiades is remembered for his debut in Round 1 of the 1989 season where he kicked 8 goals against Carlton. Only three players have kicked more goals on debut in VFL/AFL history. Georgiades's career failed to continue and his career ended after 15 games. Later that season he would accidentally kick Trevor Barker's face in an attempt to kick the ball off the ground on a dismal day at Waverly. Barker only got two possessions and Georgiades kicked no goals.
