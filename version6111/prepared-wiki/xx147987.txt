Limehouse was a borough constituency centred on the Limehouse district of the East End of London.  It returned one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

==History==

The constituency was created by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 for the 1885 general election, and abolished for the 1950 general election.
Its most prominent MP was Labour's Clement Attlee, party leader from 1935â€“55, and Prime Minister from 1945-51.

==Boundaries==

In 1885 the area was administered as part of the county of Middlesex. It was located in the Tower division, in the east of the historic county. The neighbourhood of Limehouse formed a division of the parliamentary borough of Tower Hamlets. The parliamentary division was part of the East End of London. 
In 1889 the Tower division of Middlesex was severed from the county, for administrative purposes. It became part of the County of London. In 1900 the lower tier of local government in London was re-modelled. Limehouse became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. 
When a re-distribution of parliamentary seats took place in 1918, the constituency became a division of Stepney. It comprised the wards of Limehouse North, Limehouse South, Mile End Old Town North-East, Mile End Old Town South-East, and Ratcliffe.
