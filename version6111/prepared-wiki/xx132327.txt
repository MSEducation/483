Aquaman is a Filmation animated series that premiered on CBS on September 9, 1967, and ended June 1970. It is a 30-minute version of The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure, repackaged without the Superman and Superboy segments. The show is composed of previously aired adventures featuring the DC Comics superheroes Aquaman (voiced by Marvin Miller) and his sidekick Aqualad (voiced by Jerry Dexter), the Atom, the Flash and Kid Flash, the Green Lantern and Hawkman. The Justice League of America (Atom, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman and Superman) and Teen Titans (Speedy, Kid Flash, Wonder Girl and Aqualad) are also featured in team adventures.

==DVD release==

In recent years, Aquaman episodes have been seen as part of Cartoon Network's Boomerang. In 1985, Warner Home Video released eight selected Aquaman episodes of the series on VHS in the "Super Powers" video collection along with Batman, Superboy and Superman. These videos were rereleased in 1996 and are now out of print. On October 23, 2007, Warner Home Video released The Adventures of Aquaman: The Complete Collection on DVD in Region 1; the 2-disc set features all 36 Aquaman segments from the series, as well as special features, including a retrospective featurette titled Aquaman: The Sovereign of the Seas, which explores Aquaman's depiction in various media and how his character and superheroic capabilities have progressed over the years.

==Legacy==

In episodes of Batman: The Brave and the Bold, where Aquaman is shown in flashbacks exploring his early career, his character appearance and environment resemble that portrayed in The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure.  This includes his smooth facial features and relationship with pet seahorse Storm, along with the appearance and depiction  of Aqualad.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Editor POV|date=June 2013[/tpl]
