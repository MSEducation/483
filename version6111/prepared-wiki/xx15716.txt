[[Heavy Equipment Transport System]]

CATEGORIES: Military trucks of the United States, Tank transporters, Oshkosh vehicles

The Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET) is a military logistics vehicle used to transport, deploy, and evacuate tanks, armored personnel carriers, self-propelled artillery, armored bulldozers and other heavy vehicles. The primary purpose and use of the HET system is for delivery of the M1 Abrams, recovery of non mission capable armored vehicles, and cost efficiency. An Abrams driving on or off road for 300+ miles creates a mechanical and personnel fatigue issue. The mobility of the HET system alleviates unneeded wear and tear on the armored vehicles, and is thus more cost efficient, as armored vehicles are expensive to run and maintain. Since the armored vehicles don't need to self-deploy to the battlefield, en route breakdowns are prevented, and more fighting vehicles will be available for combat.

==M1070/M1000==

In 1993 the U.S. Army started fielding the M1070 Truck Tractor and the M1000 Heavy Equipment Transporter Semi-trailer. The tractor is produced by Oshkosh Truck, and the trailer is manufactured by Systems & Electronics, Inc. (now DRS Sustainment Systems Inc.) in St. Louis. The HET transports payloads up to 70 tons – primarily Abrams tanks, but is also used for other large military equipment such as forklifts and various tracked vehicles. It is capable of operating on highways (with permits), secondary roads, and cross-country. This version of the HET has a number of features that significantly improve the mobility and overall performance of the system in a tactical environment. The M1070 tractor has front- and rear-axle steering, a Central Tire Inflation System, and cab space for six personnel to accommodate the two HET operators and four tank crewmen. The M1000 semi-trailer has automatically steerable axles and a load-leveling hydraulic suspension. It is air-transportable by both C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster III aircraft.
The Oshkosh 1070F (8×8) heavy equipment transporter (HET) became the new British Army heavy tank transporter in 2001 replacing the Scammell Commander. The Oshkosh Corporation have supplied over 2,600 Heavy Equipment Transporters to the US Army in various engine configurations such as the 1070E and the 1070E1. The UK version (1070F) is compliant to European legislation on emissions (EURO III).
As of January 22, 2013 Oshkosh set a benchmark in creating the M1070A1. A 700 horsepower Caterpillar® C18 engine provides 200 more horsepower than the original HET. And a single-speed transfer case eliminates the need to stop and shift for operation on grades. The HET dramatically reduces wear and tear on heavy equipment, cuts transportation costs and reduces team member fatigue. It is the efficient, versatile, durable, high-performing heavy equipment transporter forces can rely on to get them the equipment they need for mission success.

==M25 Tank Transporter==

The M25 Tank Transporter was a heavy tank transporter and tank recovery vehicle used in World War II and beyond by the US Army.
Nicknamed the Dragon Wagon, the M25 was composed of a 6x6 armored tractor (M26) and 40-ton trailer (M15).

===Development===

In 1942 a  new 40 ton semi-trailer tank transporter was required. This was to offer better off-road performance than the M9 24-small-wheel trailer, and greater capacity than the 30 ton 8-large-wheel Shelvoke and Drewry semi-trailers, then in use with the Diamond T tractor unit. This new trailer was designed by the Fruehauf Trailer Company (based in Detroit, MI). A new tractor unit was required, as this heavier trailer was more than the Diamond T could cope with.
The M26 tractor was designed by the San Francisco-based Knuckey Truck Company. When Knuckey's production capacity proved insufficient the Army awarded production to the Pacific Car & Foundry Co. of Seattle, Washington.
Designated TR-1 by Pacific Car, the 12-ton 6x6 M26 tractor was powered by a Type 440 240 bhp 6-cylinder gasoline engine developed exclusively for it by Hall-Scott (although also used to uprate the Diamond T). Some 2,100 Type 440s were built.[tpl]clarify|date=December 2010[/tpl] Baxter notes "over 1,300" M26 and M26A1 being built.
Unusually, the tractor unit was fitted with both an armored cab and two winches with a combined pull of 60 tons. The intention was that as well as hauling the tank transporter semi-trailer, the tractor unit could itself be used for battlefield light recovery work.
A later unarmored version of the M26 tractor was designated the M26A1. An experimental ballast tractor conversion was experimented with by the British FVPE

===Service===

The M26 entered service with the US Army in Europe in 1944-45.

===U.S. Nomenclature===

In the nomenclature system used by the U.S Army Ordnance Corps Supply Catalog this vehicle is referred as the G160.

==M911/M746/M747==

Prior to 1993, the U.S. Army employed the Commercial Heavy Equipment Transporter (C-HET), which consists of either the M746 or the M911 truck tractor, with the M747 semitrailer. Close to 1200 of these trucks were built in the mid 1970s by Oshkosh Corporation of Oshkosh, Wisconsin.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.usarc.army.mil/88thRSC/other_units/history_museum/trucks.htm |title=Fort Snelling Military Museum |accessdate=2006-11-15 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060921122416/http://www.usarc.army.mil/88thRSC/other_units/history_museum/trucks.htm  |archivedate = 2006-09-21[/tpl] During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm the HET vehicles were employed primarily to haul M1 Abrams tanks. However, they demonstrated poor durability when loads exceeded 60 tons. Some are still serving as heavy transports of other military equipment, such as cargo handling equipment.
