In 2000, she was the Labor Party candidate for the by-election for Benalla in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, which was being vacated by former Deputy Premier and state Nationals leader Pat McNamara.  On paper, Allen faced daunting odds.  Benalla was a staunchly conservative seat in rural northeastern Victoria, and had been in National hands for all but nine years since 1920.  However, she won a surprise victory over new Nationals candidate Bill Sykes, winning by only 237 votes.  She was the first Labor member ever to win it.  A Buddhist, she was the inaugural chairperson of the Parliamentary Friends of Tibet. In the 2002 state election, she was defeated by Sykes in a rematch despite Labor being reelected in a massive landslide. She was a People Power candidate for the Victorian Legislative Council in 2006, contesting Northern Victoria Region unsuccessfully.
