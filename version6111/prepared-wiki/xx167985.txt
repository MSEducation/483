Synodontis batensoda is a species of upside-down catfish.  This fish originates from the Nile, Chad, Niger, Senegal, and Gambia River basins.
S. batensoda has 39–42 gill rakers rather than 7–33 as in other Synodontis species, and its dorsal fin and adipose fin are contiguous. The body is short and deep, the eyes are large, and its colouration is grey-black tinged with brown, with a faint network of dark black spots. There is a comb of small spines near the point of the operculum.[tpl]cite journal |author=Friel, John P. & Thomas R.

This omnivorous fish feeds on plankton, algae, detritus, surface insects, chironomid larvae, benthic crustaceans and molluscs. It is oviparous and venomous.
In the aquarium hobby, this fish may be known as the giant upside-down catfish; it is peaceful and hardy fish, but may be bullied by more aggressive Synodontis species.
