Carnitine is a quaternary ammonium compound biosynthesized from the amino acids lysine and methionine.[tpl]cite journal |author=Steiber A, Kerner J, Hoppel C |title=Carnitine: a nutritional, biosynthetic, and functional perspective |journal=Mol.

In living cells, it is required for the transport of fatty acids from the intermembraneous space in the mitochondria, into the mitochondrial matrix during the breakdown of lipids (fats) for the generation of metabolic energy.[tpl]cite web|last=Mehta |first=Sweety |url=http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/10/activation-and-transportation-of-fatty-acids-to-the-mitochondria-via-the-carnitine-shuttle-with-animation/ |title=Activation and transportation of fatty acids to the mitochondria via the carnitine shuttle |publisher=Pharmaxchange.info |date=2013-10-06 |accessdate=2014-02-01[/tpl] It is widely available as a nutritional supplement.

==Biochemistry==

===Biosynthesis===

In animals, the biosynthesis of carnitine occurs primarily in the liver and kidneys from the amino acids lysine (via trimethyllysine) and methionine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/nutsupdrugs/lca_0060.shtml |title=L-Carnitine |accessdate=2007-06-01 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070508224849/http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/nutsupdrugs/lca_0060.shtml  |archivedate = 2007-05-08[/tpl] Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is not essential to the synthesis of carnitine.[tpl]cite journal|last=Furusawa|first=H|coauthors=Sato, Y; Tanaka, Y; Inai, Y; Amano, A; Iwama, M; Kondo, Y; Handa, S; Murata, A; Nishikimi, M; Goto, S; Maruyama, N; Takahashi, R; Ishigami, A|title=Vitamin C is not essential for carnitine biosynthesis in vivo: verification in vitamin C-depleted senescence marker protein-30/gluconolactonase knockout mice.|journal=Biological & Pharmaceutical Bulletin|date=September 2008|volume=31|issue=9|pages=1673–9|pmid=18758058|doi=10.1248/bpb.31.1673[/tpl]

===Role in fatty acid metabolism===

Carnitine transports long-chain acyl groups from fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, so they can be broken down through β-oxidation to acetyl CoA to obtain usable energy via the citric acid cycle. In some organisms, such as fungi, the acetate is used in the glyoxylate cycle for gluconeogenesis and formation of carbohydrates. Fatty acids must be activated before binding to the carnitine molecule to form 'acylcarnitine'. The free fatty acid in the cytosol is attached with a thioester bond to coenzyme A (CoA). This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme fatty acyl-CoA synthetase and driven to completion by inorganic pyrophosphatase.
The acyl group on CoA can now be transferred to carnitine and the resulting acylcarnitine transported into the mitochondrial matrix. This occurs via a series of similar steps:
Human genetic disorders, such as primary carnitine deficiency, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency, carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency and carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, affect different steps of this process.[tpl]cite journal |author=Olpin S |title=Fatty acid oxidation defects as a cause of neuromyopathic disease in infants and adults |journal=Clin. Lab. |volume=51 |issue=5–6 |pages=289–306 |year=2005 |pmid=15991803[/tpl]
Carnitine acyltransferase I and peroxisomal carnitine octanoyl transferase (CROT) undergo allosteric inhibition as a result of malonyl-CoA, an intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis, to prevent futile cycling between β-oxidation and fatty acid synthesis.

==Physiological effects==

===Atherosclerosis===

There may be a link between dietary consumption of carnitine and atherosclerosis, but there is also evidence that it lowers the risk of mortality and arrythmias after an acute myocardial infarction.
When certain species of intestinal bacteria were exposed to carnitine from food, they produced a waste product, trimethylamine, which is transformed in the liver to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). TMAO may be associated with atherosclerosis. The presence of large amounts of TMAO-producing bacteria was a consequence of a long-term diet rich in meat. However, when the authors compared the risk of cardiovascular events to the levels of carnitine and TMAO, they found that the risk was higher in those with higher TMAO levels, independent of the carnitine levels.
Vegetarian and vegans who ate a single meal of meat had much lower levels of TMAO in their bloodstream than did regular meat-eaters, as vegetarian and vegans had lower levels of the intestinal bacteria that converts carnitine into TMAO.[tpl]cite journal|last=Koeth|first=Robert|coauthors=et al|title=Intestinal microbiota metabolism of L-carnitine, a nutrient in red meat, promotes atherosclerosis|journal=Nature Medicine|year=2013|doi=10.1038/nm.3145|volume=19|issue=5|pages=576–85|pmid=23563705|pmc=3650111[/tpl]

===Effects on bone mass===

In the course of human aging, carnitine concentration in cells diminishes, affecting fatty acid metabolism in various tissues. Particularly adversely affected are bones, which require continuous reconstructive and metabolic functions of osteoblasts for maintenance of bone mass.

===Antioxidant effects===

The carnitines exert a substantial antioxidant action, thereby providing a protective effect against lipid peroxidation of phospholipid membranes and against oxidative stress induced at the myocardial and endothelial cell level.Claudio Cavazza, Composition for the Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis due to Menopause Syndrome (2002), US Patent 6,335,038, column 3.

===Effect on thyroid hormone action===

A 2004 study found that L-carnitine acts as a peripheral antagonist of thyroid hormone action.  In particular, L-carnitine inhibits both triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) entry into the cell nuclei.[tpl]cite journal | author = Benvenga S, Amato A, Calvani M, Trimarchi F | title = Effects of carnitine on thyroid hormone action | date = Nov 2004 | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 1033 | pages = 158–167[/tpl]

==Possible health effects==

Carnitine has been proposed as a supplement to treat a variety of health conditions including heart attack,[tpl]cite pmid | 23597877[/tpl][tpl]cite doi| 10.1016/j.trsl.2012.10.006[/tpl] heart failure, angina,[tpl]cite pmid | 21561431[/tpl] narcolepsy,[tpl]cite pmid|23349733[/tpl] and diabetic neuropathy,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/carnitine-l-000291.htm | title = Carnitine (L-carnitine) | publisher = University of Maryland Medical Center | accessdate = 2013-05-01 | date= 2011-03-31 | last = Ehrlich | first = SD [/tpl] but not fatigue, improving exercise performance, nor wasting syndrome (weight loss),; however, the same source emphasizing that there is no evidence for help with weight loss also claims that "Some studies do show that oral carnitine reduces fat mass, increases muscle mass, and reduces fatigue..".  In all of these cases (both positive and negative findings) the results are preliminary, proposed, and not part of routine treatment.

==Sources==

===Food===

The highest concentrations of carnitine are found in red meat and dairy products. Carnitine can be found at significantly lower levels in many other foods including nuts and seeds (e.g. pumpkin, sunflower, sesame), legumes or pulses (beans, peas, lentils, peanuts), vegetables (artichokes, asparagus, beet greens (young leaves of the beetroot), broccoli, brussels sprouts, collard greens, garlic, mustard greens, okra, parsley, kale), fruits (apricots, bananas), cereals (buckwheat, corn, millet, oatmeal, rice bran, rye, whole wheat, wheat bran, wheat germ) and other foods (bee pollen, brewer's yeast, carob). [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl]
In general, 20 to 200 mg are ingested per day by those on an omnivorous diet, whereas those on a strict vegetarian or vegan diet may ingest as little as 1 mg/day. No advantage appears to exist in giving an oral dose greater than 2 g at one time, since absorption studies indicate saturation at this dose. [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

===Health Canada===

Other sources may be found in over-the-counter vitamins, energy drinks and various other products.  Products containing L-carnitine can now be marketed as "natural health products" in Canada. As of 2012 Parliament has allowed Carnitine products and supplements to be imported into Canada (Health Canada). Canadian government did issue an amendment in December 2011 allowing the sale of L-carnitine without a prescription.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2011/2011-12-07/html/sor-dors275-eng.html |title=Regulations Amending the Food and Drug Regulations[/tpl]
