In Starbucks The Way I See It No 233 she said "I used to think that going to the jungle made my life an adventure. However, after years of unusual work in exotic places, I realize that it is not how far off I go, or how deep into the forest I walk that gives my life meaning. I see that living life fully is what makes life – anyone’s life, no matter where they do or do not go – an adventure."[tpl]citation|url=http://earlthornton.blogspot.com/search?q=fadiman|title=Early Morning Starbucks|work=Life in the Vast Lane|date=April 2, 2007|accessdate=March 29, 2012[/tpl]
