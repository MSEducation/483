Harrington Dock was a dock on the River Mersey and part of the Port of Liverpool. Situated in the southern dock system, it was connected to Toxteth Dock to the north and Herculaneum Dock to the south. It was built by George Fosbery Lyster and opened in 1882.
A tunnel from the Garston and Liverpool Railway emerged at the dock.
The dock closed in 1972 and has since been filled in. Most of the dock buildings still exist and are divided into small business units as part of Brunswick Business Park.
