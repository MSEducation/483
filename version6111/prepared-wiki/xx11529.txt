CATEGORIES: SI derived units, Units of electrical potential

The volt (symbol: [tpl]math|V[/tpl]) is the derived unit for electric potential , electric potential difference (voltage), and electromotive force.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-2/table3.html| title = SI Brochure, Table 3 (Section 2.2.2)| accessdate = 2007-07-29|year= 2006| publisher = BIPM[/tpl] The volt is named in honour of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta  (1745–1827), who invented the voltaic pile, possibly the first chemical battery.

==Definition==

One volt is defined as the difference in electric potential between two points of a conducting wire when an electric current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power between those points.BIPM SI Brochure: Appendix 1, p. 144 It is also equal to the potential difference between two parallel, infinite planes spaced 1 meter apart that create an electric field of 1 newton per coulomb. Additionally, it is the potential difference between two points that will impart one joule of energy per coulomb of charge that passes through it. It can be expressed in terms of SI base units (m, kg, s, and A) as:
It can also be expressed as amperes times ohms (current times resistance, Ohm's law), watts per ampere (power per unit current, Joule's law), or joules per coulomb (energy per unit charge):

===Josephson junction definition===

The "conventional" volt, V90, defined 1988 by the 18th General Conference on Weights and Measures and in use from 1990, is calibrated using the Josephson effect for exact voltage-to-frequency conversion, combined with the cesium frequency standard. For the Josephson constant, KJ = 2e/h (where e is the elementary charge and h is the Planck constant), the "conventional" value KJ-90 is used:
This standard is typically realized using an array of several thousand or tens of thousands of junctions, excited by microwave signals between 10 and 80 GHz (depending on the array design).[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/view_pub.cgi?pub_id=15238 |title=1 Volt DC Programmable Josephson Voltage Standard |first1=Charles J. |last1=Burroughs |first2=Samuel P. |last2=Benz |first3=Todd E. |last4=Harvey |first4=Clark A. |last4=Hamilton |journal=IEEE transactions on applied superconductivity |date=1999-06-01 |volume=9 |number=3 |pages=4145–4149 |issn=1051-8223[/tpl] Empirically, several experiments have shown that the method is independent of device design, material, measurement setup, etc., and no correction terms are required in a practical implementation.[tpl]Citation |title=Current status of the quantum metrology triangle |first=Mark W |last=Keller |url=http://qdev.boulder.nist.gov/817.03/pubs/downloads/set/Metrologia%2045,%20102.pdf |journal=Metrologia |volume=45 |number=1 |pages=102–109 |month=February |date=2008-01-18 |issn=0026-1394 |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/45/1/014 |quote=Theoretically, there are no current predictions for any correction terms.

==Water flow analogy==

In the water flow analogy sometimes used to explain electric circuits by comparing them with water-filled pipes, voltage (difference in electric potential) is likened to difference in water pressure.
The relationship between voltage and current is defined (in ohmic devices) by Ohm's Law.

==History==

In 1800, as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Luigi Galvani, Alessandro Volta developed the so-called Voltaic pile, a forerunner of the battery, which produced a steady electric current. Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity is zinc and silver. In the 1880s, the International Electrical Congress, now the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), approved the volt as the unit for electromotive force. They made the volt equal to 108 cgs units of voltage, the cgs system at the time being the customary system of units in science.  They chose such a ratio because the cgs unit of voltage is inconveniently small and one volt in this definition is approximately the emf of a Daniell cell, the standard source of voltage in the telegraph systems of the day.[tpl]cite book |title=Standard Cells: Their Construction, Maintenance, and Characteristics |publisher=US National Bureau of Standards |last=Hamer |first=Walter J. |date=January 15, 1965 |series=National Bureau of Standards Monograph #84 |url=http://www.nist.gov/calibrations/upload/mn84.pdf[/tpl]  At that time, the volt was defined as the potential difference what is nowadays called the "voltage (difference)" across a conductor when a current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power.
The international volt was defined in 1893 as 1/1.434 of the emf of a Clark cell. This definition was abandoned in 1908 in favor of a definition based on the international ohm and international ampere until the entire set of "reproducible units" was abandoned in 1948.
Prior to the development of the Josephson junction voltage standard, the volt was maintained in national laboratories using specially constructed batteries called standard cells. The United States used a design called the Weston cell from 1905 to 1972.
