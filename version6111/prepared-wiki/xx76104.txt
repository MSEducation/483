[[Open-source record label]]

CATEGORIES: Open content, Record labels, Netlabels

Open-source record labels are a reaction against what some musicians see as corporate control of music via means of copyright. They believe that creativity requires that musicians reappropriate and reinterpret music and sounds to enable them to create truly innovative music. 
Open source record labels hold that the fight over free, libre, and open content and media is a struggle over the freedoms of expression and speech, with the goal of radically opening up the possibilities of media through open collaboration. To this end, open source record labels attempt to release music under so-called "copyleft", a license that enables musicians to develop music collaboratively and equitably and then release it into the same license. There can thus be many versions of a single track or reuse of the same sounds for multiple tracks with no direct permission needed. Open remixing and altering is not just allowed but promoted. The user base can be the creator and collaborator for the platform because of the open license.
