[[Splitting field]]

CATEGORIES: Field theory

In abstract algebra, a splitting field of a polynomial with coefficients in a field is a smallest field extension of that field over which the polynomial splits or decomposes into linear factors.

==Definition==

A splitting field of a polynomial p(X) over a field K is a field extension L of K over which p factors into linear factors
and such that the coefficients ai generate L over K. The extension L is then an extension of minimal degree over K in which p splits. It can be shown that such splitting fields exist and are unique up to isomorphism. The amount of freedom in that isomorphism is known to be the Galois group of p (if we assume it is separable).

==Facts==

An extension L which is a splitting field for a set of polynomials p(X) over K is called a normal extension of K.
Given an algebraically closed field A containing K, there is a unique splitting field L of p between K and A, generated by the roots of p. If K is a subfield of the complex numbers, the existence is immediate. On the other hand, the existence of algebraic closures in general is usually proved by 'passing to the limit' from the splitting field result, which therefore requires an independent proof to avoid circular reasoning.
Given a separable extension K′ of K, a Galois closure L of K′ is a type of splitting field, and also a Galois extension of K containing K′ that is minimal, in an obvious sense. Such a Galois closure should contain a splitting field for all the polynomials p over K that are minimal polynomials over K of elements a of K′.

==Constructing splitting fields==

===Motivation===

Finding roots of polynomials has been an important problem since the time of the ancient Greeks.  Some polynomials, however, have no roots such as X2+1 over R, the real numbers.  By constructing the splitting field for such a polynomial one can find the roots of the polynomial in the new field.

===The construction===

The irreducible factor fi used in the quotient construction may be chosen arbitrarily.  Although different choices of factors may lead to different subfield sequences the resulting splitting fields will be isomorphic.
so π(X) is a root of f(X) and of p(X).

===The field KiX/(f(X))===

As mentioned above, the quotient ring Ki+1 = KiX/(f(X)) is a field when f(X) is irreducible.  Its elements are of the form
where the cj are in Ki and α = π(X).  (If one considers Ki+1 as a vector space over Ki then the powers αj for [tpl]nowrap|0 ≤ j ≤ n−1[/tpl] form a basis.)
The elements of Ki+1 can be considered as polynomials in α of degree less than n.  Addition in Ki+1 is given by the rules for polynomial addition and multiplication is given by polynomial multiplication modulo f(X).  That is, for g(α) and h(α) in Ki+1 the product g(α)h(α) = r(α) where r(X) is the remainder of g(X)h(X) divided by f(X) in KiX.
The remainder r(X) can be computed through long division of polynomials, however there is also a straightforward reduction rule that can be used to compute r(α) = g(α)h(α) directly.  First let
The polynomial is over a field so one can take f(X) to be monic without loss of generality. Now α is a root of f(X), so
If the product g(α)h(α)  has a term αm with [tpl]nowrap|m ≥ n[/tpl] it can be reduced as follows:

==Examples==

===The complex numbers===

Consider the polynomial ring Rx, and the irreducible polynomial [tpl]nowrap|1=x2 + 1.[/tpl] The quotient ring [tpl]nowrap|1=Rx / (x2 + 1)[/tpl] is given by the congruence [tpl]nowrap|1=x2 ≡ −1.[/tpl] As a result, the elements (or equivalence classes) of [tpl]nowrap|1=Rx / (x2 + 1)[/tpl] are of the form [tpl]nowrap|1=a + bx[/tpl] where a and b belong to R. To see this, note that since [tpl]nowrap|1=x2 ≡ −1[/tpl] it follows that [tpl]nowrap|1=x3 ≡ −x[/tpl], [tpl]nowrap|1=x4 ≡ 1[/tpl], [tpl]nowrap|1=x5 ≡ x[/tpl], etc.; and so, for example [tpl]nowrap|1=p + qx + rx2 + sx3 ≡ p + qx + r⋅(−1) + s⋅(−x) = (p − r) + (q − s)⋅x.[/tpl]
The addition and multiplication operations are given by firstly using ordinary polynomial addition and multiplication, but then reducing modulo [tpl]nowrap|1=x2 + 1[/tpl], i.e. using the fact that [tpl]nowrap|1=x2 ≡ −1[/tpl], [tpl]nowrap|1=x3 ≡ −x[/tpl], [tpl]nowrap|1=x4 ≡ 1[/tpl], [tpl]nowrap|1=x5 ≡ x[/tpl], etc. Thus: 
If we identify [tpl]nowrap|1=a + bx[/tpl] with (a,b) then we see that addition and multiplication are given by
We claim that, as a field, the quotient [tpl]nowrap|1=Rx / (x2 + 1)[/tpl] is isomorphic to the complex numbers, C. A general complex number is of the form [tpl]nowrap|1=a + ib[/tpl], where a and b are real numbers and [tpl]nowrap|1=i2 = −1.[/tpl] Addition and multiplication are given by
If we identify [tpl]nowrap|1=a + ib[/tpl] with (a,b) then we see that addition and multiplication are given by
The previous calculations show that addition and multiplication behave the same way in [tpl]nowrap|1=Rx / (x2 + 1)[/tpl] and C. In fact, we see that the map between [tpl]nowrap|1=Rx/(x2 + 1)[/tpl] and C given by [tpl]nowrap|1=a + bx → a + ib[/tpl] is a homomorphism with respect to addition and multiplication. It is also obvious that the map [tpl]nowrap|1=a + bx → a + ib[/tpl] is both injective and surjective; meaning that [tpl]nowrap|1=a + bx → a + ib[/tpl] is a bijective homomorphism, i.e. an isomorphism. It follows that, as claimed: [tpl]nowrap|1=Rx / (x2 + 1) ≅ C.[/tpl]
