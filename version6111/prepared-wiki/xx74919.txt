The British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) provides radio and television programmes for Her Majesty's Armed Forces, and their dependents worldwide. Editorial control is independent of the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces themselves.
The BFBS was established by the British War Office (now the Ministry of Defence) in 1943. Since the 1980s, BFBS has formed part of the Services Sound and Vision Corporation (SSVC), a registered charity, which is also responsible for the British Defence Film Library, SSVC Cinemas, and Combined Services Entertainment, providing entertainment for HM Forces around the world.  Neither BFBS Radio nor BFBS Television carry commercial advertising.

==BFBS Television==

BFBS Television started in Celle, near Hanover in the then West Germany on 18 September 1975 from Trenchard Barracks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bfbs.com/tv/tv_history |title=The History of Forces' Broadcasting | BFBS Television |publisher=Bfbs.com |date=18 September 1975 |accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl] This used taped broadcasts from the BBC and ITV, flown to Germany from London, which were then rebroadcast using low-power UHF transmitters.Coronation Street for the Rhine Army, New Scientist, 4 September 1975 Live broadcasts of news and sport began in 1983, using a microwave link between the UK and West Germany, extending as far east as West Berlin.The British Forces Broadcasting Service – A success Story
It was known as SSVC Television (Services Sound and Vision Corporation) between 1985 and 1997, when it reverted to the BFBS name. 
Today it now broadcasts live via satellite. DVDs are still sent to forces serving in more remote areas. There was also a service known as BFBS Navy TV, which broadcasts time-shifted versions of the channel to Royal Navy vessels around the world via military satellite.
Most programmes came from the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Five and Sky, including news from BBC News, Sky News, ITN, and sport from BBC Sport and Sky Sports. BFBS also has its own programmes, including the daily news bulletin programme British Forces News[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bfbs.com/news/programmes/british-forces-news.html |title=British Forces News | |publisher=Bfbs.com |accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl] and the children's programme Room 785.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bfbs.com/room785/ |title=Room 785 | Room 785 – BFBS Television |publisher=Bfbs.com |accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl]
BFBS Television was broadcast in some areas as a terrestrial service in the clear using low power transmitters to minimise "overspill" to non-service audiences. The satellite feed was encrypted for copyright reasons, as it is intended solely for HM Forces and their families.
Until 1997, it was also widely available in Cyprus, but its signal is now encrypted or confined to the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. Following complaints from local broadcasters like Lumiere TV, which had bought local rights to show English football and other programming, the decision was made to encrypt the signal, starting with Nicosia in April 1997 and ending with Larnaca and Limassol in May 1998.BFBS pulls the plug on Larnaca viewers, Cyprus Mail 10 May 1998 The decision was criticised by MPs in an Early Day Motion.Early day motion 775 – SSVC TV CYPRUS – UK Parliament However, as a result of card sharing by services personnel, BFBS TV (later BFBS 1) was available to unentitled viewers on the island, along with other channels until 2011, when an illegal pay-TV service was closed down in a joint operation by the Cyprus Police and the Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance.Joint police and industry action brings down card sharing pirate, Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance, 21 June 2011 
By contrast, BFBS 1 was watched by civilians in the Falkland Islands, where for many years, it was the only terrestrial TV service. It was shown on a timeshifted basis (which means that "live" events were shown between 3 and 5 hours after they had actually happened.)  This expanded the civilian terrestrial TV service as part of a digital upgrade, which included BFBS 1 and BFBS 2.The Record of the meeting of the Legislative Assembly held on Friday 18 December 2009 BFBS 1 and 2 also became available to civilian audiences in Tristan da Cunha.Channel Hopping comes to Tristan da Cunha
British Forces and their families living at BATUS in Canada had access to BFBS 1, a limited amount of BFBS 2 and BFBS 3 and Sky News on a 7 hour timeshift from CET.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bfbs.com/tv/country_guides/canada |title=Canada | BFBS Television |publisher=Bfbs.com |accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl]  During the day, the television channel that BFBS 2/3 broadcast on, played BFBS Radio 1.
In 2005, BFBS also began distributing commercial networks Kiss TV (previously 
Q), Sky News, Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2 to certain areas. It also started a movie channel on 2 May 2008, using money that it saved following the Premier League's decision to waive the £250,000 rights fee.[tpl]cite web|last=Dowell |first=Ben |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/dec/03/british-forces-broadcasting-service-redundancies |title=Forces' TV and radio set to cut 30 jobs |publisher=The Guardian |date=13 August 2007 |accessdate= 24 April 2013[/tpl]
