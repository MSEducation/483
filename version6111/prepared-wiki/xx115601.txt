The Israel Space Agency (ISA; [tpl]lang-he|סוכנות החלל הישראלית[/tpl],  Sochnut HeHalal HaYisraelit) is a governmental body, a part of Israel's Ministry of Science and Technology, that coordinates all Israeli space research programs with scientific and commercial goals.
The agency was founded by the theoretical physicist Professor Yuval Ne'eman in 1983 to replace the National Committee for Space Research which was established in 1960 to set up the infrastructure required for space missions.[tpl]cite web|title=Israel Celebrates Space|url=http://most.gov.il/SLH/Documents/ISRAEL%20CELEBRATES%20SPACE%20final.pdf|publisher=Israel Space Agency|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] The agency is currently headed by Professor Isaac Ben Israel as Chairman and Menachem Kidron as Director General.
Today, Israel is the smallest country with indigenous launch capabilities.

==History==

The Israel Space Agency has history dating back to the late 1950s.

===NCSR and foreign reliance===

The Israeli Space Agency originated as university-based research project from Tel-Aviv University in the early 1960s.[tpl]cite web|title=Israel Space Agency: Current and Future Programs|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA_Graphics/MFA%20Gallery/Israel60/ch7-6.pdf|work=From Modest Beginnings to a Vibrant State|publisher=RESOURCEs: Israel Space Agency|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] In 1960, the National Committee for Space Research (NCSR) was formed by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The committee was formed to increase research activities across the academic communities in Israel. While at the time, establishing a space program was not particularly one of its goals, during the '60s through the late '70s, the committee developed the infrastructure needed for research and development in space exploration and sciences. One of the NCSR's earliest achievements took place in 1961 with the launch of its first two-stage rocket.[tpl]cite book|title=Space: The Frontiers of Modern Defence|publisher=KnowledgeWorld|isbn=9788187966449|pages=155–165|author=Kiran Krishan Nair|year=2006[/tpl]
Following the political tension by Egypt and Syria, reconnaissance flights became evermore difficult. In 1979, a satellite program was proposed followed by a year of feasibility study. The study was completed by late 1980; Saguy requested from prime minister Menachem Begin that the project proceed to its next phase. In 1982, a new recommendation called "Ofeq Program" was submitted for developing an observation satellite. The program included timelines, planning for a ground station, budget estimates, and personnel requirements. The primary goals was to develop a satellite program without relying on any foreign know-how, to allow flexibility and creativity. The launcher would be developed by Malam, the two engines by the Israel Military Industries (IMI), and the third by Rafael.

===Establishment of a Space Agency===

At the end of 1982 it was decided during a close door meeting to establish an Israeli space agency. The decision was made by PM Menachem Begin, Defense minister Ariel Sharon, and former director Aharon Beit Halahmi. The initial goal was to pursue the program to develop to Ofeq and the Shavit launchers. In January 1983, the Israeli government authorized the Minister of Science and Technology Prof.[tpl]citation|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter_spring01/article04.pdf|url=https://cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v44i5a04p.htm|title=Israel's Quest for Satellite Intelligence|author=E. L. Zorn|journal=Studies in Intelligence|date=Winter–Spring 2001|issue=10|pages=33–38|accessdate=2009-09-11[/tpl]  Yuval Ne'eman to establish an Israeli Space Agency with the goal of advancing Israel's space program, unlike the NCSR which was primarily used for feasibility and infrastructure studies. In July 1983, the ISA was official founded in Tel Aviv to coordinate the nation's space program in affiliation to the Ministry of Science, Culture & Sport.
In 1984 the National Space Knowledge Center was established in cooperation with Israel Aircraft Industries; a contract was signed between IAI and Ministry of Defence for the development of the needed infrastructure and of Israel's first observation satellite. This came to fruition in 1988 when Israel launched the first in a series of Ofeq satellites and thus became one of only a few nations in the world possessing an indigenous space launching capability (see timeline of first orbital launches by country). The project management at Israel Aircraft Industries was headed for many years by Dr. Moshe Bar-Lev.

==Vision==

The agency vision as defined by the guiding committee on July 27, 2005 states:
"Space research and exploration is an essential instrument for the defense of life on Earth; the lever for technological progress; the key to existing in a modern society; essential for developing an economy based on knowledge; and the central attraction for scientific and qualified human resources."
The vision is "to preserve and broaden the comparative advantage of Israel and to place it among the group of leading countries in the space research and exploration area."
The main goals for vision realization are:
ISA has signed cooperation agreements with the space agencies of: USA (NASA), France (CNES), Canada (CSA), India (ISRO), Germany (DLR), Ukraine (NSAU), Russia (RKA), Netherlands (NIVR) and Brazil (AEB).

==Budget==

In 2010, the budget of the Israel Space Agency was increased to US $80 million to boost the agency's space activities in research and development. The budget does not include launch vehicle development and most satellite programs. Typically such programs get funded on a project-by-project basis. For example, Project Venus, a cooperative program by Israel (ISA) and France (CNES) which is set to launch in 2014 has a $50 million budget.[tpl]cite web|last=Opall-Rome|first=Barbara|title=Zvi Kaplan, Director, Israel Space Agency|url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/zvi-kaplan-director-israel-space-agency|publisher=SpaceNews|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] The Spaceborne Hyperspectral Applicative Land and Ocean Mission (SHALOM), a joint mission by Israel (ISA) and the Italy Space Agency (ASI) has a budget of $116 million.
The budget allocated annually for the Israeli military program as well as commercial programs are managed on different budgets.

==Satellite Programs==

The Israel Space Agency has had a long history of satellite programs both for reconnaissance and commercial purposes. Its first satellite, the Ofeq-1 was launched on September 19, 1988 from Palmachim Airbase in Israel. Since the launching of that first satellite, Israel has developed into a significant player in the commercial space arena. Today, the ISA satellite launches include:

===Ofeq Satellite Series===

After the successful launch of the Ofeq-1 in 1988, additional satellites were developed. In 1989, the ISA launched the Ofeq-2; in April 1995, it took a leap forward with the launch of Ofeq-3, which carried an advanced electro-optical payload built by Israeli industry for local purposes. Ofeq-3 has been functioning without a hitch. Following a setback with Ofeq-4, Ofeq-5 was successfully launched in May 2002.
To date, ten such satellites in the Ofeq reconnaissance satellites series were developed and launched to Low Earth Orbit. The most recent Ofeq-10 was launched April 9, 2014.

===Amos Satellite Series===

The Amos is a series of communications satellites. The Amos satellites are by the Israel Aerospace Industries and are operated by Spacecom once in orbit. The Amos-1, the first satellite in the series, was launched on May 16, 1996 using a French-built vehicle. Since then, 4 more satellites were launched. The most recent Amos satellite is the Amos-5 which was launched on December 11, 2011.[tpl]cite web|title = Amos 5 satellite launched into space|url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4159943,00.html[/tpl]
The Amos is distinguished for its light weight and sophisticated technology. The Amos-6 is set to be launched in 2016 in order to replace the Amos-2 which will cease operation then.

===EROS Satellite Series===

The Earth Resources Observation Satellite (EROS) is a series of commercial observation satellites. The first satellite, the EROS A, was launched on December 5, 2000 from Svobodny Launch Complex using a Russian Start-1. A second satellite, the EROS B, was launched on April 25, 2006.
The EROS series are set to be launched once every 6 to 8 years. The EROS C is set to be launched in late 2014.

===TechSAR Satellite===

The TechSAR satellite is a reconnaissance satellite equipped with a synthetic aperture radar. The satellite is designed penetrate thick clouds by being fitted with a large dish-like antenna to transmit and receive radar signals. The satellite was successfully launched on January 21, 2008.

==Launch Capabilities==

The Israel Space Agency is one of only seven countries that both build their own satellites and launch their own launchers. The Shavit is a space launch vehicle capable of sending payload into low earth orbit.[tpl]cite web|title=Space launch systems - Shavit|url=http://www.deagel.com/Space-Launch-Systems/Shavit_a001901001.aspx|publisher=Deagel|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] The Shavit satellite has been used to send every Ofeq satellite to date.
The development of the Shavit began in 1983 and its operational capabilities were proven on three successful launches of the Ofek satellites on September 19, 1988; April 3, 1990; and April 5, 1995. The Shavit launchers allows low-cost and high-reliability launch of micro/mini satellites to a Low Earth Orbit. The Shavit launcher is developed by Malam factory, one of four factories in the IAI Electronics Group. The factory is very experienced in development, assembling, testing and operating system for use in space.
The Shavit is a triple-stage launcher solid propellant booster based on the 2-stage Jericho-II ballistic missile. The first and second stage engines are manufactured by Ta'as, and use solid fuel. The third stage engines are manufactured by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The next generation Shavit rockets, now called the Shavit-2 are being developed. The Shavit-2 is said to be made available for commercial launches in the near future.

===Palmachim Spaceport===

The Israel Space Agency operates the spaceport located in Palmachim Air Force Base. The launchpad is situated at [tpl]coord|31|53|04|N|34|40|49|E|type:landmark|name=Shavit launchpad[/tpl].
Due to Israel's geographic location and hostile relations with surrounding countries, launches takes off due west, over the Mediterranean Sea. This is done in order to avoid flying over hostile territories.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1376231/Shavit | contribution = Shavit | title = Britannica[/tpl] This is also to prevent possible debris from falling above populated areas. This limitation imposes a penalty of roughly 30% on its lifting capabilities.
Some of the recent recent ISA launches include:
A number of additional launches are set for mid to late 2014 and 2015.

==Space Research==

The ISA is responsible for funding a large set of university research projects and governmental projects. The goal is to boost space related research and development in the academic arena. The Israel Space Agency strives to promote space research and space technology development as a part of the effort to promote the Israeli scientific research.

===National Knowledge Center on NEOs===

The ISA and the Ministry of Science and Technology formed and operated the National Knowledge Center on Near Earth Objects at Tel-Aviv University in order to study minor bodies in the Solar System. The goal is to map the objects which pose a threat to earth and to find a solution to eliminate them.
This center is headed by Dr. Noah Brosch from Tel Aviv University and operates the two telescopes of the Wise Observatory. For this purpose, a special wide-field 0.46-m telescope was acquired by Tel Aviv University and is operating at the Wise Observatory located near Mitzpe Ramon. The telescope facilitated the discovery of several tens of new asteroids. Following the cessation of funding from ISA, the asteroid studies are continuing at the Wise Observatory with no specific financial support.

===Israel Cosmic Ray Center===

The Israel Cosmic Ray Center (ICRC) was established in November 1997 with support from the Israel Space Agency and with affiliation to Tel Aviv University and the Technion. The center is located on Mount Hermon and headed by Dr. Gideon Bela and Prof. Lev Dorman from the University of Tel-Aviv.[tpl]cite web|title=ICRC|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/institutes/advanced/cosmic/|publisher=Israel Cosmic Ray and  Space Weather Center|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]
The goal of the center is to monitor and forecast dangerous meteorological and space phenomena. This includes solar radiation storms and shockwaves between very powerful stars creating magnetic storms. These phenomena can endanger electronic systems in satellites and space shuttles, the astronauts' health, electronic and navigational systems in aircraft flying in extremely high altitudes and ground power systems.
The Emilio Segre' Observatory (ESOI) is a cosmic radiation observatory prepared via a joint collaboration with Italy. It was transported to Mount Hermon, Israel in June 1998. The observatory was named after the Italian physicist and Nobel laureate Emilio G. Segrè.[tpl]cite web|title=ESOI|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/institutes/advanced/cosmic/esoi.html|publisher=Emilio Segre' Israel-Italy Observatory|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]

===EOSDIS ISA-MEIDA===

The Israel Space Agency - Middle East Interactive Data Archive (ISA-MEIDA) is an Israeli node for NASA's EOSDIS (Earth Observing System Data and Information System). The Node was established on October 1996 as a part of the cooperation agreement between the director of NASA and the director of ISA. It is the only team in the country which focuses on collecting and preserving environmental information in Israel. The ISA-MEIDA was established in order to create and maintain an Earth observing data center available through the Internet to the research community and to the general public free of charge.[tpl]cite web|title=ISA-MEIDA Welcome|url=http://nasa.proj.ac.il/|publisher=ISA-MEIDA|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]
This research, headed by Prof. PinhasAlpert, is funded by the ISA as a part of the Space Scientific and Technological Infrastructure Development program. The node is integrated with NASA's global Information System which includes Earth Observing Science Data and Information System. It also contains Remote Sensing Data from NASA and NOAA satellites, and data from other sources such as meteorological RADAR and readings from meteorological stations. Information collected by the system is critical for environmental and water related research, especially in light of the drastic global environmental changes and global warming.[tpl]cite web|title=he Regional Center for NASA EOSDIS|url=http://nasa.proj.ac.il/about.html|publisher=ISA-MEIDA|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]

===Tel Aviv University Ultraviolet Explorer===

The Tel Aviv University Ultraviolet Explorer (TAUVEX) is a space telescope array conceived by Noah Brosch of Tel Aviv University. It was eventually designed and constructed for the University by El-Op. TAUVEX is a cluster of three bore-sighted  20-cm telescopes for observation in the ultra-violet funded by the Israel Space Agency. It was due to be launched by India on board the ISRO satellite GSAT-4 satellite but due to a mis-match between the capabilities of the launched and the mass of the satellite, ISRO decided unilaterally to remove TAUVEX from GSAT-4. The telescope ended up in a limbo of constant delays. In 2012 ISA decided to terminate the TAUVEX project.

===TechSat-Gurwin Microsatellite===

The Gurwin TechSat was one of the world's first Microsatellite to be designed, built and launched by students.[tpl]cite web|title=O(R)bituary|url=http://www.focus.technion.ac.il/May10/newsStory11.htm|publisher=TECHNION FOCUS MAGAZINE|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] The satellite, developed by the Technion, was launched on July 10, 1998. The satellite was a great success, operating for over 11 years - setting a world record for the longest university satellite mission. The mission was completed on April 2010.

===Sloshsat-FLEVO===

The Sloshsat-FLEVO was a satellite launched for the study of liquid sloshing phenomena in space. The satellite was developed in collaboration between the Dutch NLR labs, Fokker Space, and Rafael. The satellite is helped by the Israel Space Agency and the European Space Agency (ESA). The Israel Space Agency initiated the project and partly funded it by supplying the sub-propulsion system.[tpl]cite web|title=SLOSHSAT|url=http://most.gov.il/English/space/projects/Pages/SLOSHSAT.aspx|publisher=Israel Space Agency|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]
The propulsion system, funded by the ISA, is fueled by cold gas and is constructed of four high-pressure canisters with pyrotechnic activation. The system can produce both linear acceleration and torque needed to perform slosh research. It is specifically designed to overcome the sever volume constraints encountered in typical satellites.

==Ongoing Development==

The Israel Space Agency is currently involved in the of multiple satellites, space telescopes, and microsatellite.

===VENµS===

The Vegetation and Environment monitoring on a New Micro-Satellite (VENµS) is a satellite to be used for Earth observation using a superspectral sensor, dedicated to vegetation monitoring. It is the first cooperation between Israel (ISA) and France (CNES).

The conference is designed to bring together the Israel's space community and international peers. Over the years, the conference has been drawing distinguished scientists, head of space agencies, and global prominent figures.

==Experiments Via NASA Shuttles==

The ISA has conducted a number of experiments, both manned and unmanned, in collaboration with NASA using the space shuttle. In October 1996, NASA and ISA signed an agreement for joint cooperation in the peaceful use of space - an agreement designed to develop cooperative programs of mutual interest between the two nations.

===Israeli Space Agency Investigation About Hornets===

The Israeli Space Agency Investigation About Hornets (ISAIAH) was project form Tel-Aviv University that was initiated in the early 90s to explorer the effects of oriental hornets on near-zero gravity, their physical and physiological development and their nest-building instincts. The flight hardware and measuring instruments were commissioned by the ISA and built by ISI. The hope of the mission was to discover ways to prevent astronauts from suffering headaches, nausea, and vomiting during the missions.[tpl]cite web|title=Project ISIAH - Experiment on the effects of micro-gravity on hornets' nest building and activity|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992IsSRT...9....2B|publisher=The Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl]
In 1992, 230 Oriental hornets, a flight hardware and measuring instruments were packed onto the Space Shuttle Endeavour mission STS-47.[tpl]cite web|title=STS-47|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-47/mission-sts-47.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] The Oriental Hornets used in the experiment were capable of building combs in the direction of the gravitational vector and detecting gravitational force changes in real time.[tpl]cite web|title=The Hornet Experiment|url=http://www.iami.org.il/projectsEng.htm|publisher=IAMI|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl]

===Early Development of Embryos in Microgravity===

The Early development of mice embryos in microgravity was an Hebrew University experiment designed to determine if mice embryo cells could develop normally in microgravity conditions in space. The outcome of the experiment was expected to help the understanding of early embryo cell development which would provide an insight into the possibilities of human reproduction in space. The payload was launched in 1996 on board Space Shuttle Columbia mission STS-80.[tpl]cite web|title=Detrimental Effects of Microgravity on Mouse Preimplantation Development In Vitro|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006753|publisher=PLOS|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl]
On the same mission, a second experiment investigating the growth of osteoblast cells in microgravity environment was also conducted. During STS-80 osteoblast cultures were grown in microgravity, using specialized hardware. The space-grown osteoblastic cells were then compared with the Earth-grown osteoblastic cells. The research revealed numerous changes between the two cells. The microgravity cells showed lower proliferation rate, a lower metabolism and an altered cell structure.
A continuation from the osteoblast cells experiment was later expanded upon by astronaut John Glenn on board Space Shuttle Discovery, STS-95. The tests included the thinning effect of space on mouse bones. Additionally the process of calcium loss in the mouse bone was later compared to what happened in Glenn's body and effectiveness of a calcium-vitamin D supplement against osteoporosis.

===MEIDEX===

The 2003 Mediterranean Israeli Dust Experiment (MEIDEX) was a Mediterranean Israeli Dust Experiment initiated by the ISA. The experiment was planned by a team from the Department of Geophysics and Planetary Sciences in Tel Aviv University. The objective was to study the temporal and spatial distribution and physical properties of atmospheric desert dust over North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Saharan regions. The aim was achieved by a remote sensing experiment operated by the astronaut Ilan Ramon aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia.

==Moon Mission==

The Israeli Space Agency has sponsored the first Israeli effort to land a spacecraft on the moon. Additionally the ISA has been collaborating with NASA about future lunar research programs.

===Israel Network for Lunar Science and Exploration===
