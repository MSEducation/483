==History==

The festival of Kali Puja is an ancient one in Bengal and Assam. She was originally worshipped by the native Austric people of the region. Later gradually she was incorporated into the Brahminical pantheon[tpl]Citation needed|reason=This is very wide topic with several, possibly contradictory viewpoints One, that too, a recent source, is not enough.|date=November 2013[/tpl]. During the time of Sri Chaitanya there was fierce rivalry between the 'Shaktos' viz. Kali worshippers and the 'Vaishnavs' viz. Krishna worshippers in Bengal and north Eastern India. Kali Puja gained popularity in the 19th century Bengal and Assam, with the Bengali/ Assamese elite; wealthy landowners began patronizing the festival on a grand scale.McDermott p. 173 Along with Durga Puja, now - Kali Puja is the biggest goddess festival in Assam and Bengal.McDaniel p. 223

==Worship==

Kali puja (like Durga Puja) worshipers honor goddess Kali in their homes in the form of clay sculptures and in pandals (temporary shrines or open pavilions). She is worshipped at night with Tantric rites and mantras. She is prescribed offerings of red hibiscus flowers, animal blood in a skull, sweets, rice and lentils, fish and meat. It is prescribed that a worshiper should meditate throughout the night until dawn.McDaniel p. 234 Homes may also practice rites in the Brahmanical (mainstream Hindu-style, non-Tantric) tradition with ritual dressing of Kali in her form as Adya Shakti Kali. Animals are ritually sacrificed on Kali Puja day and offered to the goddess. A celebration of Kali Puja in Kolkata and in Guwahati is also held in a large cremation groundFuller p. 86 where she is believed to dwell in both places.
The pandals also house images of god Shiva - the consort of Kali, Ramakrishna and Bamakhepa- two famous Bengali Kali devotees along with scenes from mythology of Kali and her various forms along with Mahavidyas, sometimes considered as the "ten Kalis". The Mahavidyas is a group of ten Tantric goddesses headed by Kali.Kinsley p.18 People visit these pandals throughout the night. Kali Puja is also the time for magic shows and theatre, fireworks.McDaniel pp. 249-50, 54 Recent custom involves drinking wine.Harding p. 134
In the Kalighat Temple in Kolkata and in Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati, Kali is worshipped as Lakshmi on this day so as to reflect an essence of Vaishnava Haldars on Kali worship. The temple is visited by thousands of devotees who offer animal sacrifices to the goddess. Another famous temple dedicated to Kali in Kolkata is Dakshineswar Kali Temple. The famous Kali devotee Ramakrishna was a priest at this temple. The celebrations have changed little from his time. See Harding pp. 125-6 for a detailed account of the rituals in Dakshineshwar.

==Other celebrations==

Although the widely popular annual Kali Puja celebration, also known as the Dipanwita Kali Puja, is celebrated on the new moon day of the month of Kartika, Kali is also worshipped in other new moon days too. Two other major Kali Puja observations are Ratanti Kali Puja and Phalaharini Kali Puja, respectively celebrated on the new moon days of the Hindu months of Margashirsha and Jyeshta. The Phalaharini Kali Puja is specially important in the life Sri Ramakrishna and  Sri Sarada Devi, since on this day in 1872 Sri Ramakrishna worshipped Sri Sarada Devi as Shodashi.[tpl]cite book |last1=Gambhirananda |first1=Swami |title= Holy Mother Shri Sarada Devi |edition=1st |year= 1955|publisher= Shri Ramakrishna Ashrama, Madras |location= Madras |pages=48–51[/tpl] In many Bengali households, Kali is worshipped daily.[tpl]cite book |last1=Banerjee |first1=Suresh Chandra |title= Shaktiranga Bangabhumi |trans_title= Bengal, The Abode of Shaktism|edition=1st |year= 1991|publisher= Ananda Publishers Pvt Ltd |location= Kolkata |language= Bengali |isbn= 81-7215-022-9|page=114[/tpl]
