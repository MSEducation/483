California Governor Pat Brown was quoted as saying that a flood of similar proportions could "happen only once in 1,000 years," and it was often referred to later as the Thousand Year Flood. The flood killed 19 people, heavily damaged or completely devastated at least 10 towns, destroyed all or portions of more than 20 major highway and county bridges, carried away millions of board feet of lumber and logs from mill sites, devastated thousands of acres of agricultural land, killed 4,000 head of livestock, and caused $100 million in damage in Humboldt County, California alone.

==History==

An atypical cold spell began in Oregon on December 13, 1964, froze the soil, and was followed by unusually heavy snow.[ref]
  
</ref>
Subsequently, a Pineapple Express storm brought persistent heavy warm rain. The temperature increased by [tpl]convert|30|to|40|F-change|C-change|sigfig=2[/tpl]. This melted the snow, but left the soil frozen and impermeable. Some places received the equivalent of a year's rain in just a few days. Albany received [tpl]convert|13|in|mm|sigfig=2[/tpl] of rain in December, almost double its average rainfall of [tpl]convert|7|in|mm|sigfig=1[/tpl]. Detroit recorded an extra [tpl]convert|18|in|mm|sigfig=2[/tpl] of rain, and at Crater Lake, where the average normal December rainfall is [tpl]convert|12|in|mm|sigfig=2[/tpl], there was over [tpl]convert|38|in|mm|sigfig=2[/tpl] of rain. As rivers and streams overflowed and the soil became saturated, reports of mudslides, closed roads and reservoirs filled over-capacity came from throughout the state. Many towns were isolated. By the end of the flood, every river in Oregon was above flood stage and more than thirty major bridges were impassable.

===Late January===

Heavy warm rain and melting snow caused more flooding in late January 1965, after the waters had begun to recede from the December flood. More mudslides occurred in places that had withstood the December flooding, and there were more deaths. Many streams in the northern San Joaquin Valley reached higher flows than they had in December.[ref]

==Impact and aftermath==

===Oregon===

The Christmas flood of 1964 was "the most severe rainstorm to ever occur over central Oregon, and among the most severe over western Oregon since the late 1870s", according to the National Weather Service office in Portland.
Some of the worst mudslides occurred in the Mount Hood Corridor, and one man died in a mud and debris avalanche near Rhododendron that destroyed 15 houses. Other deaths occurred from drowning and electrocution, and one man died when the new John Day bridge collapsed.
Yamhill County was severely impacted. The bridge between Newberg and St. Paul and the road between Newberg and Wilsonville were closed, trapping hundreds of people.
On the Oregon Coast, downtown Reedsport was flooded with [tpl]convert|8|ft|m|sigfig=2[/tpl] of water, and in Coos Bay, a massive logjam contributed to severe flooding. The ports at Gold Beach and Brookings were destroyed.
At Oregon City, Willamette Falls was unrecognizable as a waterfall, and the city was flooded by several feet of water. In Portland, the lower deck of the Steel Bridge was underwater and had also been hit by a log raft consisting of around 1,000 logs. The impact of the raft severely damaged the Hawthorne Bridge, closing it for a year. At [tpl]convert|12|ft|m|sigfig=2[/tpl] above flood stage, the flooding of the Willamette River at Portland in 1964 was second only to the 1948 flood that wiped out Vanport City. At its peak, the water was at the top of Downtown Portland's seawall.

===California===

Starting on December 21, intense downpours all across Northern California caused numerous streams to flood, many to record breaking levels. California Governor Brown declared 34 counties in the region disaster areas. Together, Del Norte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Siskiyou, Trinity, and Sonoma counties sustained more damage than the other 28 counties combined. Twenty-six U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gages were destroyed.

====North Coast====

The Eel, Smith, Klamath, Trinity, Salmon, and Mad rivers, as well as other rivers and large streams, all went well beyond flood stage and peaked nearly simultaneously around December 21 and 22, breaking previous records (notably those set in the "hundred year" flood of 1955 in most cases). Sixteen state highway bridges were destroyed in California's 1st congressional district, most of them on Highway 101, and another ten county bridges were destroyed in Humboldt County. The flood devastated the tracks and multiple stream and river crossings of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad, the region's only major railroad, and related spur lines.
Many communities of Del Norte and Humboldt counties suffered massive power outages and were left isolated (or completely cut off from the rest of the state for a period), including the region's larger populated areas around Humboldt Bay, such as Eureka and Arcata, despite the fact that those cities were located on higher ground and not in the path of raging rivers. Unfortunate riverside communities like Klamath, Orleans, Myers Flat, Weott, South Fork, Shively, Pepperwood, Stafford, and Ti-Bar were completely destroyed by flood waters; some of them were never rebuilt and none regained their former status. Metropolitan, Rio Dell, and Scotia were significantly damaged. Crescent City, still recovering from the tsunami created by the 1964 Alaska earthquake only nine months earlier, also suffered from the floods.
Over [tpl]convert|550|mm|in|disp=flip|sigfig=2[/tpl] of rain fell on the Eel River basin in a span of two days. By December 23, [tpl]convert|752000|ft3/s|m3/s|sigfig=3[/tpl] of water rushed down the Eel River at Scotia (still upstream from the confluence of the Van Duzen River),[ref]
  
</ref>
[tpl]convert|200000|ft3/s|m3/s|sigfig=3[/tpl] more than the 1955 flood, and more than the average discharge of the entire Mississippi River basin.[ref]
  
</ref>
Just under [tpl]convert|200000|ft3/s|m3/s|sigfig=3[/tpl] of water flowed down the South Fork Eel River alone, causing severe damage along its entire length. Every single stream gage on the Eel River was destroyed. The flood crest at Miranda was [tpl]convert|46|ft|m|sigfig=2[/tpl]. Signs were later placed on top of tall poles to mark the unusual height of the water.[ref]
  
</ref>
The Smith River, located in Del Norte County near the Oregon border, reached flows of [tpl]convert|228000|ft3/s|m3/s|sigfig=3[/tpl] at Hiouchi,[ref]
  
</ref>
easily surpassing the 1955 flood's previous record of [tpl]convert|165000|ft3/s|m3/s|sigfig=3[/tpl]. The town of Gasquet received [tpl]convert|26.6|in|mm|sigfig=3[/tpl] of rain over an eight-day period, and Crescent City received [tpl]convert|9.2|in|mm|sigfig=2[/tpl].
The Klamath River reached flows of [tpl]convert|557000|ft3/s|m3/s|sigfig=3[/tpl],[ref]
  
</ref>
submerging the town of Klamath under [tpl]convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2[/tpl] of water.
One of the Klamath's largest tributaries, the Trinity River, also flooded and wrought destruction along its length. The Trinity, however, did not break the 1955 flood's records because of the newly constructed Trinity Dam, which stored [tpl]convert|372200|acre.ft|m3|sigfig=4[/tpl] of runoff from the storm. Nonetheless, an impressive [tpl]convert|231000|ft3/s|m3/s|sigfig=3[/tpl] of water rushed down the river at Hoopa.[ref]
  
</ref>
Between December 20 and December 26, a staggering [tpl]convert|10390000|acre.ft|km3|sigfig=4[/tpl] of water flowed into the Pacific Ocean from the combined rivers and streams on the North Coast.

====Central Valley and beyond====

In the Central Valley, the Yosemite Valley was flooded, and residents of Yuba City were evacuated. Many streams reached record flood stages, including the Feather River, Yuba River, American River, Cottonwood Creek, and Butte Creek. The flood caused the uncompleted Hell Hole Dam on the Rubicon River to fail, sending even more water downstream. In total, [tpl]convert|375000|acre|ha|sigfig=3[/tpl] of the Central Valley was flooded.

===Elsewhere===

In southwest Washington, rising rivers threatened Centralia and Longviewâ€“Kelso and closed Interstate 5 and all railways at flooded Kalama for over a week.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] In Nevada, the Truckee River threatened Reno.
