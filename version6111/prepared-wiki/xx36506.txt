The Washington Metro, commonly called Metro, and branded Metrorail,[tpl]cite book |last1=Schrag |first1=Zachary |title=The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro  |year=2006 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore, Maryland |isbn=0-8018-8246-X |page=9 |chapter=Introduction[/tpl]Google Books search/preview is the rapid transit system in Washington, D.C., United States, as well as its surrounding suburbs. It is administered by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), which also operates Metrobus service under the Metro name.Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, Frequently Asked Questions, accessed July 2009: "What do I need to know to build near Metro property? Metro reviews designs and monitors construction of projects adjacent to Metrorail and Metrobus property..." In Maryland, Metro provides service to Montgomery County and Prince George's County; in Virginia, to Fairfax County, Arlington County, and the City of Alexandria. Since opening in 1976, the network has grown to include five lines, 86 stations, and 106.3 miles (171.1 km) of track.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/docs/metrofacts.pdf|title=WMATA Facts|date=July 2009|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=March 18, 2010[/tpl]
Metro is the second-busiest rapid transit system in the United States in number of passenger trips, after the New York City Subway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/08q3hr.pdf|title=Heavy Rail Rapid Transit Ridership Report, Third quarter 2008|last=Dawson|first=Christie|date=December 4, 2008|publisher=American Public Transportation Association|accessdate=January 27, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] There were 215.3 million trips, or 727,684 trips per weekday, on Metro in fiscal year 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2179|title=215 million people rode Metro in fiscal year 2008|date=July 8, 2008|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=January 27, 2009[/tpl] In June 2008, Metro set a new monthly ridership record with 19,729,641 trips, or 798,456 per weekday. Fares vary based on the distance traveled, the time of day, and the type of card used by the passenger. Riders enter and exit the system using a stored-value card in the form of a paper magnetic stripe farecard or a proximity card known as SmarTrip.

==History==

During the 1960s, there were plans for a massive freeway system in Washington, but opposition to this freeway system grew. Harland Bartholomew, who chaired the National Capital Planning Commission, thought that a rail transit system would never be self-sufficient because of low density land uses and general transit ridership decline. Finally, a mixed concept of a Capital Beltway system along with rail line radials was agreed upon. The Beltway received full funding; funding for the ambitious Inner Loop Freeway system was partially reallocated toward construction of the Metro system.[tpl]cite book |author=Schrag, Zachary |title=The Great Society Subway: A History of the Washington Metro |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |isbn= 0-8018-8246-X[/tpl]
In 1960, the federal government created the National Capital Transportation Agency to develop a rapid rail system. In 1966, a bill creating WMATA was passed by the federal government, the District of Columbia, Virginia, and Maryland,[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/docs/history.pdf| title = WMATA History| format = PDF| publisher = WMATA| accessdate =February 3, 2011[/tpl]
with planning power for the system being transferred to it from the NCTA.
WMATA approved plans for a [tpl]convert|98|mi|km|sing=on[/tpl] regional system in 1968, and construction began in 1969, with groundbreaking on December 9. The first portion of the system opened March 27, 1976, with [tpl]convert|4.6|mi[/tpl] available on the Red Line with five stations from Rhode Island Avenue to Farragut North, all in the District of Columbia.[tpl]cite news |title= Metro Opens: Crowds Stall Some Trains |work= The Washington Post |first= Jack |last= Eisen |date= March 28, 1976 |page= 1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/146502708/fulltextPDF/13B3865663DCF6C247/2?accountid=46320 [/tpl] Arlington County, Virginia was linked to the system on July 1, 1977;[tpl]cite news |title= D.C. will open new leg of its subway today |work= The Baltimore Sun |agency= Associated Press |date= July 1, 1977 |page= D2 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/541116307/13B386EDD651933F920/12?accountid=46320 [/tpl]  Montgomery County, Maryland, on February 6, 1978; Prince George's County, Maryland, on November 20, 1978;[tpl]cite news |title= Metro's Orange Line Begins Service Today |work= The Washington Post |date= November 20, 1978 |page= C1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/146815281/13B3874103350A50B4B/2?accountid=46320 [/tpl] and Fairfax County, Virginia, and Alexandria, Virginia, on December 17, 1983.[tpl]cite news |title= Metro Extension Opens With Flourish: Yellow Line Opened to Huntington Alexandria Welcomes Yellow Line |first= Stephen J. |last= Lynton |work= The Washington Post |date= December 18, 1983 |page= B1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/147511500/13B3876633E9B632/2?accountid=46320 [/tpl]  Underground stations were built with cathedral-like arches of concrete, highlighted by soft, indirect lighting.Luz Lazo, "Riders: Let there be light"; Express (Washington, D.C.), Dec 3, 2012, p. 12.

Construction began in March 2009 for an extension to Dulles Airport to be built in two phases and opening in 2014 and 2018.[tpl]cite web| title=Dulles Metrorail Project Overview| publisher=WMATA| url=http://www.dullesmetro.com/about/index.cfm| accessdate=June 22, 2011[/tpl]
Metro construction required billions of federal dollars, originally provided by Congress under the authority of the National Capital Transportation Act of 1969 (Public Law 91-143). The cost was paid with 67% federal money and 33% local money. This act was amended on January 3, 1980 by Public Law 96-184, "The National Capital Transportation Amendment of 1979" (also known as the Stark-Harris Act), which authorized additional funding of $1.7 billion to permit the completion of [tpl]convert|89.5|mi|km[/tpl] of the system as provided under the terms of a full funding grant agreement executed with WMATA in July 1986, which required 20% to be paid from local funds. On November 15, 1990, Public Law 101-551, "The National Capital Transportation Amendments of 1990", authorized an additional $1.3 billion in federal funds for construction of the remaining [tpl]convert|13.5|mi|km[/tpl] of the [tpl]convert|103|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] system, completed via the execution of full funding grant agreements, with a 63% federal/37% local matching.[tpl]cite web|url=http://planitmetro.com/2014/02/24/gut-check-funding-metro-2025/|title=Gut Check – Funding Metro 2025|date=February 24, 2014|accessdate=February 24, 2014|work=planitmetro.com|publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|author=Shyam[/tpl]
The highest ridership for a single day was on the day of the inauguration of Barack Obama, January 20, 2009, with 1,120,000 riders. It broke the previous record, set the day before, of 866,681 riders.  June 2008 set several ridership records: it set the single-month ridership record of 19,729,641 total riders, the record for highest average weekday ridership with 1,044,400 weekday trips, had five of the ten highest ridership days, and had 12 weekdays in which ridership exceed 800,000 trips.
In February 2006, Metro officials chose Randi Miller, a car dealership employee from Woodbridge, Virginia, to record new "doors opening", "doors closing", and "please stand clear of the doors, thank you" announcements after winning an open contest to replace the messages recorded by Sandy Carroll in 1996.  The "Doors Closing" contest attracted 1,259 contestants from across the country.
On October 30, 2010, the crowd at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear broke a 19-year record in Saturday ridership, with 825,437 trips.  The previous record had been set on June 8, 1991 at 786,358 trips during the Desert Storm rally.[tpl]cite news| title=Jon Stewart 'Rally to Restore Sanity' crowds set new record for DC transit with 825,437 trips| date=November 1, 2010| author=Joanna Malloy and Corky Siemaszko|work=Daily News |location=New York| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/11/01/2010-11-01_jon_stewart_rally_to_restore_sanity_crowds_set_new_record_for_dc_transit_with_82.html| work=(New York) Daily News| accessdate=June 22, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite press release| title=Metro sets new record for highest Saturday Metrorail ridership| date=October 31, 2010|  url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=4717| publisher=WMATA[/tpl]

==Architecture==

Many Metro stations were designed by Chicago architect Harry Weese (1915-1998), and are examples of late-20th century modern architecture. With their heavy use of exposed concrete and repetitive design motifs, Metro stations display aspects of brutalist design.  The stations also reflect the influence of Washington's neoclassical architecture in their overarching coffered ceiling vaults. In 2007, the design of the Metro's vaulted-ceiling stations was voted number 106 on the American Institute of Architects' "America's Favorite Architecture" list. 
In January 2014, the  American Institute of Architects (AIA) announced that it would present its Twenty-Five Year Award to the Washington Metro system for "an architectural design of enduring significance" that "has stood the test of time by embodying architectural excellence for 25 to 35 years".  The announcement cited the key role of Weese, who conceived and implemented a "common design kit-of-parts" which continues to guide the construction of new Metro stations over a quarter-century later.[tpl]cite web|last=Mortice|first=Zach|title=2014 Twenty-five Year Award|url=http://www.aia.org/practicing/awards/2014/twenty-five-year-award/|work=American Institute of Architects|publisher=American Institute of Architects|accessdate=2014-02-11[/tpl] More recently built stations feature different architecture, which still shows the influence of the original Weese designs.[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl]

==Metro network==

Since opening in 1976, the Metro network has grown to include five lines, 86 stations, and [tpl]convert|106.3|mi|km[/tpl] of track. The rail network is designed according to a spoke-hub distribution paradigm, with rail lines running between downtown Washington and its nearby suburbs. The system makes extensive use of interlining – running more than one service on the same track. There are five operating lines and one line under construction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dullesmetro.com/construction/index.cfm|title=Construction|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|accessdate=April 21, 2009[/tpl]  The system's iconic official map was designed by noted graphic designer Lance WymanDana Hedgpeth, "After more than 30 years, Metro map is being redesigned by creator Lance Wyman", The Washington Post, June 4, 2011. and Bill Cannan while they were partners in the design firm of Wyman & Cannan in New York City.[tpl]cite web|title=Metro|url=http://www.billcannandesign.com/metro|accessdate=February 4, 2012[/tpl]
There are 40 stations in the District of Columbia, 15 in Prince George's County, 11 in Montgomery County, 11 in Arlington County, six in Fairfax County, and three in the City of Alexandria. The Silver Line will add 11 new stations, eight in Fairfax County and three in Loudoun County, Virginia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dullesmetro.com/about/index.cfm|title=Dulles Metrorail Project Overview|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|accessdate=January 28, 2009[/tpl]
About [tpl]convert|50|mi|km[/tpl] of Metro's track is underground, as are 47 of the 86 stations. Track runs underground mostly within the District and high-density suburbs. Surface track accounts for about [tpl]convert|46|mi|km[/tpl] of the total, and aerial track makes up [tpl]convert|9|mi|km[/tpl].
At [tpl]convert|196|ft|m[/tpl] below the surface, the Forest Glen station on the Red Line is the deepest in the system. There are no escalators; high-speed elevators take 20 seconds to travel from the street to the station platform.
The Wheaton station, next to Forest Glen station on the Red Line, has the longest continuous escalator in the USA and in the Western Hemisphere, at [tpl]convert|230|ft|m[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/02/us/02escalators.html | title=For Washington, a Trek to Daylight | publisher=New York Times | date=July 1, 2011 | accessdate=July 26, 2012 | author=Walsk, Sean Collins[/tpl]
The Rosslyn station is the deepest station on the Orange/Blue Line, at [tpl]convert|117|ft|m[/tpl] below street level. The station features the second-longest continuous escalator in the Metro system at [tpl]convert|194|ft|m[/tpl]; an escalator ride between the street level and the mezzanine level takes nearly two minutes.[tpl]cite journal|date=Summer 2006|title=Discover A New Horizon|journal=Rosslyn Magazine|volume=1|issue=2|page=21[/tpl]
The system is not centered on any single station, but Metro Center is at the intersection of the Red, Orange and Blue Lines, the three busiest lines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/docs/media_guide_2008.pdf|title=Media Guide 2008|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=January 28, 2009[/tpl] The station is also the location of WMATA's main sales office. Metro has designated five other "core stations" that have high passenger volume, including:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/pdfs/planning/Demand_Passenger%20Facilities.pdf|title=Core Stations Capacity Enhancements|date=October 21, 2008|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=January 28, 2009[/tpl] Gallery Place, transfer station for the Red, Green and Yellow Lines; L'Enfant Plaza, transfer station for the Orange, Blue, Green and Yellow Lines; Union Station, the busiest station by passenger boardings; Farragut North; and Farragut West.
In order to deal with the high number of passengers in transfer stations, Metro is studying the possibility of building pedestrian connections between nearby core transfer stations. For example, a [tpl]convert|750|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] passage between Metro Center and Gallery Place stations would allow passengers to transfer between the Orange/Blue and Yellow/Green Lines without going one stop on the Red Line. Another tunnel between Farragut West and Farragut North stations would allow transfers between the Red and Orange/Blue lines, decreasing transfer demand at Metro Center by an estimated 11%. The Farragut pedestrian tunnel has yet to be physically implemented, but was added in virtual form effective October 28, 2011. The SmarTrip system now interprets an exit from one Farragut station and entrance to the other as part of a single trip, allowing card holders to transfer on foot without having to pay a second full fare.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=5074 |title=Metro launches Farragut Crossing |publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority |date=October 28, 2011 |accessdate=January 6, 2012[/tpl]
Metro runs special service patterns on holidays and when events in Washington may require additional service. Independence Day activities require Metro to adjust service to provide extra capacity to and from the National Mall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/board_of_directors/board_docs/061605_IVBJuly4OperationsPlan.pdf|title=July 4th, 2005 Operations Plan|date=June 16, 2005|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=January 28, 2009[/tpl] WMATA makes similar adjustments during other events, such as presidential inaugurations. Metro has altered service and used some stations as entrances or exits only to help manage congestion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2419|title=Several Metrorail stations to be entry/exit only on Inauguration Day|date=January 13, 2009|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=January 28, 2009[/tpl]
In an effort to gain revenues, WMATA has started to allow retail ventures in Metro stations. WMATA has authorized DVD-rental vending machines and ticket booths for the Old Town Trolley Tours and is seeking additional retail tenants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=4889|title=Metro launches retail at Smithsonian Metrorail station|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=April 7, 2011[/tpl]

===Rush Plus===

In 2012, WMATA announced enhanced rush period service that was implemented on June 18, 2012 under the name Rush+ (or Rush Plus).  Rush Plus service occurs only during portions of peak service: 6:30-9 AM and 3:30-7 PM, Monday through Friday.
The Rush Plus realignment is intended to free up space in the Rosslyn Portal (the tunnel between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom), which operates at full capacity already. When Silver Line service begins, those trains will need to be routed through the tunnel, and so some of what were Blue Line trains to Largo Town Center are now diverted across the Fenwick Bridge to become Yellow Line Trains running all the way to Greenbelt. Select Yellow Line trains running south will divert along the Blue Line to Franconia-Springfield (as opposed to the normal Yellow line terminus at Huntington). Until the start of Silver Line Service, excess Rosslyn Tunnel capacity will be used by additional Orange Line trains. The additional Orange Line trains will travel along the Blue Line to Largo (as opposed to the normal Orange Line terminus at New Carrollton). Rush Plus has the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys, though severely increasing headways for the portion of the Blue Line running between Pentagon and Rosslyn.

===Rolling stock===

Metro’s fleet consists of 1,126 rail cars, each [tpl]convert|75|ft|m|2[/tpl] long.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2624|title=Tuesday Red Line service altered as a result of Monday collision|date=June 23, 2009|work=WMATA press release|accessdate=June 23, 2009[/tpl] Trains have a maximum speed of [tpl]convert|75|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], and average [tpl]convert|33|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] including stops. Operating rules presently limit their top speed to [tpl]convert|59|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].  All cars operate as married pairs (consecutively numbered even-odd), with systems shared across the pair.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/media_relations/glossary.cfm|title=Glossary|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=January 28, 2009[/tpl] Metro currently operates 850 cars during rush hours. 814 cars are in active service, four cars have been permanently removed from revenue service for use as the "money train", and the remaining 36 cars compose gap trains to serve as backup should a train experience problems.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2546 |title=Metrorail system adds trains to fleet |publisher=WMATA |date=April 9, 2009 |accessdate=July 16, 2009[/tpl]
Metro's rolling stock was acquired in six phases, and each version of car is identified with a separate series number. The original order of 300 rail cars (290 of which are in operation [tpl]As of|2009|6|lc=on[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2006/RAR0601.pdf|title=NTSB Accident Report RAR-06-01, Collision Between Two Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Trains at the Woodley Park- Zoo/Adams Morgan Station in Washington, D.C.

These cars are numbered 1000–1299 and were rehabilitated in the mid-1990s. Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie (Breda), now AnsaldoBreda, manufactured the second order of 76 cars delivered in 1983 and 1984. These cars, numbered 2000–2075, were rehabilitated in the early 2000s by Alstom in Hornell, New York. A third order of 288 cars, also from Breda, were delivered between 1984 and 1988. These cars are numbered 3000–3291 and were rehabilitated by Alstom in the early 2000s. An order of 100 cars from Breda, numbered 4000–4099, were delivered between 1992 and 1994. A fifth order of 192 cars was manufactured by Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) of Spain. These cars are numbered 5000–5191 and were delivered from 2001 through 2004. A sixth order of 184 cars from Alstom Transportation, are numbered 6000-6183 and were delivered between 2005 and 2007.  The cars have body shells built in Barcelona, Spain with assembly completed in Hornell, New York.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/board_of_directors/board_docs/020807_4a.pdf|title=Railcars Semi-Annual Update|date=February 8, 2007|publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|accessdate=January 28, 2009[/tpl]
The 7000 series of cars, currently being built by Kawasaki Railcar Corp. of Kobe, Japan are being delivered for on-site testing during winter 2013, and are to go into service in early 2014. The new cars will be different from previous models in that while still operating as married pairs, the cab in one car would be removed, essentially turning it into a B car. The new design will allow for increased passenger capacity, elimination of redundant equipment, greater energy efficiency, and lower maintenance costs. Metro plans to eventually purchase up to 748 cars to increase system capacity and replace its older rolling stock.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/board_of_directors/board_docs/092508_8A7000SeriesRailcar.pdf|title=7000 Series Railcar Program: Overview|date=September 25, 2008|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=January 28, 2009[/tpl] The National Transportation Safety Board investigation of the fatal June 22, 2009, accident led it to conclude that the 1000 series cars are unsafe and unable to protect customers in a crash.

===Signaling and operation===

During normal passenger operation on revenue tracks, trains are designed to be controlled by an integrated Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and Automatic Train Control (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention.  All trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/board_of_directors/board_docs/033105_Rev3033005PrecisionStopping.pdf|title=Precision Station Stopping Progress Update|date=March 21, 2005|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=January 27, 2009[/tpl]
Since June 2009, when two Red Line trains collided and killed nine people due in part to malfunctions in the ATC system, all Metro trains have been manually operated.[tpl]cite news|last=Hohmann|first=James|title=After Fatal Crash, Metro Still Wary Of Letting Computers Control Trains|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/18/AR2009081802446.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 19, 2009[/tpl] The current state of manual operation has led to heavily degraded service, with new manual requirements such as absolute blocks, speed restrictions, and end-of-platform stopping leading to increased headways between trains, increased dwell time, and worse on-time performance.Customer Services, Operations, and Safety Committee, "Manual vs. Automatic Operation and Operational Restrictions," Information Item IV-B, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Board, March 11, 2010. As of August 2012, Metro has no plans or timetable to return to ATO or ATC.
The train doors were originally designed to be opened and closed automatically and the doors would re-open if an object blocked them, much as elevator doors do.  Almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 Metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled.  At present the doors may be opened automatically or manually.  If a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction, the operator must re-open the door.

===Hours and headways===

Metrorail begins service at 5 am Monday through Friday and at 7 am Saturdays and Sundays; it ends service at midnight Sunday through Thursday nights and at 3 am on Friday and Saturday nights, although the last trains leave the end stations inbound about half an hour before these times. Trains run more frequently during rush hours on all lines, with scheduled peak hour headways of 3 minutes on the Red Line and 6 minutes on all other lines. Headways are much longer during midday and evening on weekdays and all weekend. The midday six-minute headways are based on a combination of two Metrorail lines (Orange/Blue and Yellow/Green) as each route can run every 12 minutes; in the case of the Red Line, every other train bound for Glenmont terminates at Silver Spring instead. Night and weekend service varies between 8 and 24 minutes, with trains generally scheduled only every 20 minutes. As of summer 2012, the WMATA board of directors was considering adopting a new policy that would codify maximum acceptable headways as 15 minutes during peak hours and 30 minutes during off-peak.Michael Perkins, "Metro Headway Policy Needs Clarity," Greater Greater Washington, August 23, 2012.
Other service truncations also occur in the system during rush hour service only. On the Red Line, every other train bound for Shady Grove terminates at Grosvenor-Strathmore, in addition to the alternating terminations at Silver Spring mentioned above. For the Yellow Line, all non-Rush+ trains (that is, all trains originating from Huntington, not Franconia-Springfield) bound for Fort Totten terminate at Mount Vernon Square. These are primarily instituted due to a limited supply of rail cars and the locations of pocket tracks throughout the system.
Until 1999, Metro ended service at midnight every night, and weekend service began at 8 am. That year, WMATA began late night service on Fridays and Saturdays until 1 am. By 2007, with encouragement from businesses, that closing time had been pushed back to 3 am.Luke Roziak, "Metro Eyes 12 AM Weekend Closing," Washington Post, February 11, 2011. There were plans floated to end late night service due to costs in 2011, but they were met with resistance by riders.J.

==Passenger information==

A Passenger Information Display System (PIDS) was installed in all Metrorail stations in 2000. Displays are located on all track platforms and at the mezzanine entrances of stations, and provide real-time information on next train arrivals, delayed trains, emergency announcements, and related information.WMATA (March 26, 2004). "Metro offers enhancements for the passenger information display monitors." News release. WMATA also provides current train and related information to customers with conventional web browsers, as well as users of smartphones and other mobile devices.WMATA. "Mobile Services." Accessed November 19, 2012. In 2010 Metro began sharing its PIDS data with outside software developers, for use in creating additional real-time applications for mobile devices. Free apps are available to the public on major mobile device software platforms (iPhone/iPad, Android, Windows Phone, Palm).WMATA (August 6, 2010). "Metro invites software developers to discuss new transit data feed." News release.WMATA. "Developer Resources." Accessed November 19, 2012. WMATA also began providing real-time train information by phone in 2010.WMATA (August 31, 2010). "Real-time next train arrival information now available by phone." News release.

==Fare structure==

Riders enter and exit the system using a stored-value card in the form of a paper magnetic stripe farecard or a proximity card known as SmarTrip. The fare is deducted from the balance of the card; on paper farecards, the new balance is printed upon exiting the system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/getting_around/faregates.cfm|title=How to Use Metrorail Faregates, Farecards, and Passes|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=January 27, 2009[/tpl] Farecards are purchased primarily at vending machines in each station. Paper farecards can hold up to $45 in value and are reused until the value of the card reaches zero. If the card contains the exact fare needed to exit, leaving the card at a zero balance, the card is not returned by the exit gate. SmarTrip cards can be purchased at station vending machines, online or at retail outlets, and can store up to $300 in value.
Metro fares vary based on the distance traveled and the time of day at entry. During regular hours (weekdays from opening until 9:30 a.m. and 3–7 p.m., and Friday and Saturday nights from midnight to closing), fares (effective July 1, 2012) range from $2.10 to $5.75, depending on distance traveled. At all other times, fares range from $1.70 to $3.50 based on distance traveled. Customers using a paper farecard must add an additional $1.00 fee for each ride. Discounted fares are available for school children, the disabled, and the elderly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/fares/metrorail.cfm|title=Metrorail Fares |publisher=WMATA|accessdate=December 9, 2010[/tpl] Metro charges reduced fares on all federal holidays.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/board_of_directors/board_docs/121406_6GMGRProposedBudget.pdf|title=General Manager’s Fiscal 2008 Proposed Operating and Capital Budgets|date=December 14, 2006|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=January 27, 2009[/tpl]
Passengers may purchase passes at most farecard vending machines. The passes are used the same way as farecards but grant riders unlimited travel within the system for a certain period of time. All the passes are gate-activated, with the period of validity starting with the first use of the pass, and for the paper versions, the expiration date of the pass is printed on the pass when exiting the system at the end of the first trip. Four types of passes are currently sold:
