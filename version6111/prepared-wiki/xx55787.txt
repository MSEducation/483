Laurence Housman ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aʊ|s|m|ən[/tpl]; 18 July 1865 - 20 February 1959)1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica gives his birthdate as June 18, 1867. was an English playwright, writer and illustrator.

==Early life==

Laurence Housman was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, one of seven children who included the poet A. E. Housman and writer Clemence Housman. In 1871 his mother died, and his father remarried, to a cousin.  After education at Bromsgrove School, he went with his sister Clemence to study art at the Lambeth School of Art and the Royal College of Art in London.

==Illustrating==

He first worked as a book illustrator with London publishers, illustrating such works as George Meredith's Jump to Glory Jane (1892), Jonas Lie's Weird Tales (1892), Christina Rossetti's Goblin Market (1893), Jane Barlow's The End of Elfintown (1894) and his sister's Werewolf (1896)[tpl]Cite EB1911|wstitle=Housman, Laurence[/tpl] in an intricate Art Nouveau style. During this period, he also wrote and published several volumes of poetry and a number of hymns and carols.Examples are the hymns "The Holy Innocents" and "Father eternal, ruler of creation".

==Writing==

When his eyesight began to fail, he turned more and more to writing.
Housman's first literary success came with the novel An Englishwoman's Love-letters (1900), published anonymously. He then turned to drama with Bethlehem (1902) and was to become best known and remembered as a playwright. His other dramatic works include Angels and Ministers[tpl]gutenberg|no=11020|name=Angels & Ministers[/tpl] (1921), Little Plays of St. Francis (1922) and Victoria Regina (1934) which was even staged on Broadway. Housman's play, Pains and Penalties, about Queen Caroline, was produced by Edith Craig and the Pioneer Players.Cockin, Katharine. Women and Theatre in the Age of Suffrage: The Pioneer Players 1911-25, Palgrave (2001)
Some of Housman's plays caused scandals because of depiction of biblical characters and living members of the Royal House on stage, and many of them were only played privately until the subsequent relaxation of theatrical censorship. In 1937 the Lord Chamberlain ruled that no British sovereign may be portrayed on the stage until 100 years after his or her accession. For this reason, Victoria Regina could not be staged until the centenary of Queen Victoria's accession, 20 June 1937. This was a Sunday, so the premiere took place the next day.All the Best People ...: The Pick of Peterborough 1929-1945, George Allen & Unwin, 1981; p. 139
Housman also wrote children's fairy tales such as A Farm in Fairyland (1894) and fantasy stories with Christian undertones for adults, such as All-Fellows (1896), The Cloak of Friendship (1905), and Gods and Their Makers (1897).

A prolific writer with around a hundred published works to his name, his output eventually covered all kinds of literature from socialist and pacifist pamphlets to children's stories. He wrote an autobiography, The Unexpected Years (1937), which, despite his record of controversial writing, said little about his homosexuality.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/laurencehousman.html  |title=Laurence Housman |work=Knitting Circle |accessdate=2007-08-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080205235400/http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/laurencehousman.html |archivedate = 2008-02-05[/tpl] He also edited his brother's posthumous poems.

==Activism==

Housman held what for the time were controversial political views. He was a committed socialist and pacifist and founded the Men's League for Women's Suffrage with Henry Nevinson and Henry Brailsford in 1907. He was also a member of the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology and the Order of Chaeronea.[tpl]cite book |first=Katharine |last=Cockin |title=Housman, Laurence (1865–1959) |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004[/tpl]
In 1909, Laurence, with his sister Clemence founded the Suffrage Atelier, an arts and crafts society who worked closely with the Women's Social and Political Union and Women's Freedom League. They encouraged non-professional artists to submit work, and paid them a small percentage of the profits.http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/collections/FSB.html

===Housmans Bookshop===

In 1945 he opened Housmans Bookshop in Shaftesbury Avenue, London, founded in his honour by the Peace Pledge Union, of which he was a sponsor.  In 1959, shortly after his death, the shop moved to 5 Caledonian Road, London N1 9DX, where it is still a prime source of literature on pacifism and other radical approaches to living.[ref]Tom Willis and Emily Johns, "The man who made it all possible"
