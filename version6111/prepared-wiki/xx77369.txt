[[Bi-quinary coded decimal]]

CATEGORIES: Numeral systems, Computer arithmetic

Bi-quinary coded decimal is a numeral encoding scheme used in many abacuses and in some early computers, including the Colossus.  The term bi-quinary indicates that the code comprises both a two-state (bi) and a five-state (quinary) component. The encoding resembles that used by many abaci, with four beads indicating either 0 through 4 or 5 through 9 and another bead indicating which of those ranges.
Several human languages, most notably Khmer and Wolof, also use biquinary systems.  For example, the Khmer word for 6, pram muoy, literally means five plus one.

==Decoding==

To decode the Biquinary code use the number 5043210.[tpl]cite book|title=Digital Logic and Computer Design|publisher=Prentice Hall of India|isbn=978-0-87692-417-4|pages=17-18|author=M. Morris Mano|edition=2nd|language=English|chapter=1[/tpl]  
At each digit multiply the biquinary number by the number 5043210. This will give one decimal digit. 
For example take the number 0110000. To change this into decimal:

==Examples==

Several different representations of bi-quinary coded decimal have been used by different machines.  The two-state component is encoded as one or two bits, and the five-state component is encoded using three to five bits.  Some examples are:
