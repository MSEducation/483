==Launch==

===United States===

Verizon explicitly promoted the Droid as an Apple iPhone alternative. Launched on October 17, 2009, TV spots and an associated website made "entertainingly combative" claims[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/173865/verizons_droid_targets_iphone.html |title=Verizon's Droid Targets iPhone |first=Harry |last=McCracken |date=18 Oct 2009 |work=PC World[/tpl] listing features then lacking on the iPhone, e.g. "iDon't multitask", only mentioning the name of the Droid in the final frame, reading "Droid Does".  At the official launch event on October 28, 2009, Verizon's Chief Marketing Officer John Stratton described the campaign as a spoof of Apple's iPhone ads, intended to "wake up the market."[tpl]cite news|last=Reardon |first=Marguerite |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30686_3-10384994-266.html |title=Verizon, Motorola unveil the Droid | Signal Strength - CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2009-10-28 |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]
The marketing for the American launch included "Droid Does Times Square."[tpl]cite web |last=Genius |first=Boy |url=http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2009/10/28/verizon-wireless-to-take-over-times-square-with-the-motorola-droid/ |title=Verizon Wireless to take over Times Square with the Motorola DROID « Boy Genius Report |publisher=Boygeniusreport.com |date=2009-10-28 |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] This was a program (billed as an "interactive experience") in which Verizon connected the Nasdaq and Reuters electronic billboards in Times Square to its systems such that people were able to control the electronic displays by using voice commands (illustrating the voice search function that is a primary Android feature). Control of the billboards was available in Times Square or via the "Droid Does" website.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.droiddoes.com/timessquare |title=Droid from Verizon Wireless - Times Square |publisher=Droiddoes.com |date=2008-08-11 |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]
The November 6, 2009, release date of the Droid came just under a month after Verizon and Google announced that they had entered into an agreement[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/100609-google-verizon-android.html |title=Google, Verizon teaming to develop Android devices |publisher=Network World |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] to jointly develop wireless devices based on the Android mobile platform. Verizon said at the time that it planned to have two Android-based handsets on the market by year-end with more to come in 2010. The other handset is the HTC Droid Eris, a modification to the HTC Hero, seen in shots of Google CEO Eric Schmidt holding one in a Verizon/Google press conference.[tpl]cite web |url=http://phandroid.com/2009/10/06/verizon-motorola-android-live-picture/ |title=Verizon Motorola Android Live Picture! | Android Phone Fans |publisher=Phandroid.com |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]
American exclusive software for the Droid includes Google Maps Navigation, an Amazon MP3 Store applet, and Verizon Wireless Visual Voice Mail management.[tpl]cite web |url=http://pcmike.com/2009/10/30/the-droid-best-iphone-competitor-to-date/ |title=The Droid: Best iPhone competitor to date | PC Mike - Tech News and Reviews |publisher=PC Mike |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]

This number is greater than that of the original iPhone which sold one million units through day 74.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.flurry.com/bid/31410/Day-74-Sales-Apple-iPhone-vs-Google-Nexus-One-vs-Motorola-Droid |title=Day 74 Sales: Apple iPhone vs. Google Nexus One vs. Motorola Droid[/tpl]

===Software===

This section applies to the Verizon-branded Motorola device in the US. Droid versions in foreign markets (Milestone) may be crippled or have some features disabled due to restrictions enforced by retailer agreements, carrier agreements, manufacturer agreements, or local laws and should be addressed in the appropriate section above.
The Linux kernel used in the 2.0.1 OTA release is 2.6.29, Android build.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.motorola-droid.org/motorola-droid-software-updates/android-2-3-release-%28gingerbread%29 |title=Android 3.0 Release (Gingerbread) |date= |accessdate=2010-05-06[/tpl]

====Android 2.1 update====

On February 8, 2010, Motorola announced via Facebook that the Droid update would begin rolling out later that same week.[tpl]cite web |first=Engadget |url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/08/motorola-droid-update-to-android-2-1-will-start-to-roll-out-th/ |title=Motorola: Droid update to Android 2.1 'will start to roll out this week |publisher=Engadget.com |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2010-02-10[/tpl] Details were later released via Motorola's official forums.[tpl]cite web|first=Engadget |url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/10/motorola-details-android-2-1-update-for-droid/ |title=Motorola details Android 2.1 update for Droid |publisher=Engadget.com |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2010-02-10[/tpl] However, the details about the update were later retracted, and unclear information from Motorola and Verizon Wireless caused confusion among many, and technology news websites speculated the update would happen even later in 2010.[tpl]cite web|first=Engadget |url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/11/motorola-jumped-the-gun-with-details-of-droids-android-2-1-up/ |title=Motorola: Motorola 'jumped the gun' with details of Droid's Android 2.1 update |publisher=Engadget.com |date=2010-02-11 |accessdate=2010-02-12[/tpl] As an attempt to clear confusion, Motorola released a chart of dates stating when each of their Android devices would be updated to Android 2.1, but this only added to the issues because they said the update would happen "soon", rather than offering a concrete time frame.
However, on March 17, 2010, Verizon Wireless announced that they would issue the Android 2.1 "ESE53" update over-the-air, beginning March 18 to a small test group, and more users would see the update later, into the following week. But screenshots from Verizon Wireless documents showed that a last minute software bug was found, and the update was delayed once again, with no new roll out date determined.
The new news from Verizon Wireless provided official information about the update and what it entailed, including "Pinch-to-zoom...available when using the browser, Gallery, and Google Maps", a weather and news app/widget including "information you want from the Web...weekly and hourly weather forecasts based on your location, and news headlines", voice-to-text wherever there are text boxes, "New Gallery application with 3D layout", and Live Wallpapers "offering richer animated, interactive backgrounds on the home screen", as well as other, more minor upgrades. However, the update did not include the addition of two more home screens currently available on the Nexus One, another Android 2.1 device.
The 2.1 update roll out began on March 30, 2010.[tpl]cite web|first=Verizon Wireless |url=http://support.vzw.com/pdf/system_update/moto_droid.pdf |title=Get the Most Out of Your DROID by Motorola « Verizon Wireless |publisher=support.vzw.com |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-03-27[/tpl]

====Android 2.2 update====

After some apparent discussion by Motorola over whether they would provide an Android 2.2 Froyo upgrade for the Droid and Milestone, it was confirmed that the Droid would get the upgrade, and a staggered roll out began."Motorola Droid getting Android 2.2 next week" This roll out began on August 3, 2010 and updates the phone to Android 2.2 build number FRG01B. Another update for the Droid began on August 24, 2010, and it included some minor bug fixes. This update's build number is FRG22D.http://www.droid-life.com/2010/08/23/breaking-verizon-releasing-update-to-allow-flash-10-1-installation-starting-tomorrow/
A third update was released on December 6, 2010, with a version number of 2.2.1 and a build of FRG83D. A fourth update was released on March 9, 2011, with a version number of 2.2.2 and a build of  FRG83G.[tpl]cite web |url=http://techie-buzz.com/mobile-news/motorola-droid-android-2-2-2-update.html |title=Motorola Droid Android 2.2.2 Update Rolling Out Today! |last=Pandey |first=Rajesh |date=9 March 2011 |work=Techie Buzz |accessdate=2011-03-15[/tpl]
The Motorola support page reported the Milestone version would get an update to Android 2.2 in the Q1 2011, and indeed on March 15 an update was made available.https://supportforums.motorola.com/community/manager/softwareupgrades

===Root access and unsupported Android releases[tpl]anchor|Root access[/tpl]===

The Motorola Droid was successfully "rooted" (manipulated to provide superuser access) on December 8, 2009.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.androidguys.com/2009/12/08/the-droid-has-been-rooted/ |title=The Droid Has Been Rooted |publisher=AndroidGuys |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] This allowed removing sponsored/pay-to-use applets (Amazon, Verizon Visual Voice Mail, etc.), installing and launching custom software, and root access on the phone using a terminal emulator.
On June 5, 2010, a leaked Android 2.2 ROM was given to the public for those with superuser access. It includes a new home launcher, Flash 10.1 support, new homescreen widgets, an updated Market, a JIT compiler for a faster system, as well as new aesthetic changes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mydroidworld.com/forums/motorola-droid/2477-download-froyo-2-2-your-motorola-droid.html |title=Download Froyo 2.2 for Your Motorola Droid|publisher=MyDroidWorld |date= |accessdate=2010-06-05[/tpl]

===Geographic launch information===

The launch countries for the Motorola Milestone included Germany, Italy and Argentina on November 9, 2009.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20091102/motorola-droid-motorola-milestone-motorola-droid-release-date-motorola-droid-germany-verizon-iphone-.htm |title=Motorola Droid going global as Motorola Milestone in 3 countries - International Business Times |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] Other European countries soon followed.
Joining this trend, a new, North American, version of the Motorola Milestone was released in Canada in February 2010. This new version supports 3G bands II and V instead of bands I and VIII so it is compatible with Rogers, Bell, and Telus in Canada, and with AT&T and T-Mobile (2G Only) in the US.  At this time, Motorola Milestone is only available from Telus.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pmptoday.com/2009/11/10/motorola-milestone-coming-to-canada-in-early-2010-exclusive-to-telus/ |title=Motorola Milestone coming to Canada on the 9 February 2010, Exclusive to Telus | PMP Today |publisher=Pmptoday.com |date=2009-11-10 |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  The Milestone is also available in the U.S. from several regional GSM carriers, like Cincinnati Bell.

====United Kingdom====

The phone was launched in the United Kingdom on Thursday December 10, 2009, as the Motorola Milestone. The exclusive sales outlet for the phone, eXpansys, reported that all stocks of the phone had completely sold out within 3 hours of its debut. The sell-out was considered a major victory for Motorola, which has had little success with its prior Windows Mobile-based phones, and had been counting on Android-based phones for future growth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.electronista.com/articles/09/12/11/international.droid.sees.record.sales/ |title=Moto Milestone's UK launch sells out in 3 hours |date=11 December 2009 |publisher=Electronista |accessdate=13 December 2009[/tpl]

====Middle East====

The phone was launched in the Middle East in 2010, however it included a serious limitation as Google prohibited access to its Android Market application for most of Middle Eastern countries. No reasonable alternative was provided by Google.

====Asia, India====

The Milestone was launched in Hong Kong on December 21, 2009,[tpl]cite news |author=‘Stone IP’ |title=香港 Motorola Milestone 香港發佈開放發問 |language=Chinese |trans_title=Motorola Milestone Question in HK |publisher=Engadget Chinese edition |date=19 December 2009 |url=http://chinese.engadget.com/2009/12/19/motorola-milestone-question-in-hk/ |accessdate=2011-01-07[/tpl] as the sixth Android device in the region for HKD 4,680 with an 8 GB microSDHC card included. This version is in English but supports Chinese hand writing that originated from the Motorola MING and pinyin input method. While MOTONAV is included, it does not work and is not officially supported. The phone can be updated to Android 2.1 since Q1 2010, the update features a Chinese user interface and more Chinese input methods such as Changjie. The Milestone launched in India on 30 March 2010, priced at 32,000 INR, approximately US$680.

===Locked bootloader===

Unlike the DROID, the Milestone has a bootloader that only allows signed firmware to load. This creates difficulties for users who wish to boot custom ROM images not signed by Motorola that have become popular in the Droid modding community. This has caused discontent in the Droid community in markets foreign to the US, with numerous petitions being created.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.groubal.com/motorola-lockedencrypted-bootloader-policy/ |title=Motorola Locked/Encrypted Bootloader Policy |publisher=groubal.com petition website |accessdate=2011-07-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/unlockmoto |title=Unlock Motorola Facebook page |publisher=facebook.com |accessdate=2011-07-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wakeupmoto.com/ |title=Wake Up Moto!! |publisher=wakeupmoto.com |accessdate=2011-07-07[/tpl]  Whether the disabling of custom boot loaders is due to retailer, carrier, manufacturer, or legal restrictions is unknown.
Early in 2011 the community around Milestone ROM-Development and the Polish National BOINC Team initiated AndrOINCAndrOINC to decipher the RSA 1024-bit signature and make customizing possible. The project has been down since April 2011 because the German police confiscated the server on suspicion it was involved with an illegal P2P service.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.planet3dnow.de/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=4409929#post4409929 | title=androinc down ? | publisher=Planet 3DNow! Forum | author=Sabroe SMC | date=08.04.2011 | accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl]
In June 2011, Motorola committed to delivering an unlockable/relockable bootloader solution for phones receiving updates later that year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ausdroid.net/2011/06/14/an-update-on-motorolas-locked-boot-loader-situation/ |title=An update on Motorola’s locked boot-loader situation |publisher=ausdroid.net |accessdate=2011-07-07[/tpl] This will likely not include the Milestone as Motorola has not indicated it will update the Milestone past Android 2.2/Froyo.

====Root access====

Despite the locked bootloader, the Motorola Milestone has been successfully rooted. Several step-by-step guides are available on the web.[tpl]cite web |url=http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=698059 |title=(GUIDE) Root + Nandroid Backup/Restore with Open Recovery |publisher=xda-developers |date= |accessdate=2011-07-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://android.modaco.com/content/motorola-milestone-droid-milestone-modaco-com/308422/milestone-2-1-update-and-root-guide/ |title=MILESTONE 2.1 update and root guide |publisher=android.modaco.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-07[/tpl]

As of March 20, the update was still being rolled out was not available in all countries. Community created ROMs of Android 2.2 (Froyo), Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and Android 4 (Ice Cream Sandwich) have existed for some time, typically based on kernels from leaked updates.
The continued postponing of Milestone updates has become known under the term "Motofail" in Central and South America.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
