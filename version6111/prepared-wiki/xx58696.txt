Gore is a service town for the surrounding farm communities.
It is divided by the Mataura River into Gore and East Gore, the majority of the town being situated on the western banks of the river. The Main South Line railway from Dunedin to Invercargill runs through the town, though passenger services ceased in 2003.  Gore was once a busy railway junction; the Waimea Plains Railway ran west to connect with the Kingston Branch in Lumsden, while the Waikaka Branch connected with the Main South Line nearby in McNab. One of New Zealand's most famous preserved trains is the Kingston Flyer, which takes its name from a passenger express that once ran between Kingston and places south, but never to or through Gore although some people think that it did.See, for example, http://www.railheritage.org.nz/assets/NZR_MILEAGE_TABLE_1957.pdf

==History==

Before the arrival of Europeans the current site of Gore was a part of or near the routes used by Maori travellers. Tuturau, near modern Mataura, was the nearest Maori settlement.   In 1836 southern Maori repelled a raid from the north, which provided sufficient security for Europeans  to purchase land and settle in the area. By the mid-1850s large tracts nearby had been converted into sheep runs.
As crossing the Mataura River involved a long fording, the locality became known as “the Long Ford”, or Longford. In 1862 a few town sections were surveyed on the west bank of the river and Longford was named Gore as a compliment to Sir Thomas Gore Browne, an early Governor of New Zealand. One of the first buildings was Long Ford House an accommodation house opened by local sawmill owner Daniel Mortonhttp://www.teara.govt.nz/Places/Southland/SouthlandPlaces/4/en “Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand“.

A village named Gordon after Governor Sir Arthur Gordon became established on the opposite bank of the Mataura. By 1864 a road from Balclutha through Gore to Invercargill had been opened for wheeled traffic which allowed  the establishment of a regular coach service between Invercargill and Dunedin.

===Becomes established===

By 1877 there were enough business opportunities in the area for the Bank of New Zealand to establish a branch in Gore. Within another three years both the Bank of Australasia and the Colonial Bank had also opened branches. In 1899 the Bank of New South Wales followed suit.http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/Cyc04Cycl-fig-Cyc04Cycl0771a.html  “The Cyclopedia of New Zealand & Southland Provincial Districts - Gore“.

After its construction began in the early 1870s, a railway line between Invercargill and Gore was opened on 30 August 1875. By 22 January 1879 the railway had been extended to Balclutha where it linked with an existing line to Dunedin. A private Waimea Plains railway from Gore to Lumsden was opened on 31 July 1880. This was subsequently purchased by the Government in 1886. It connected Gore with the Invercargill-Kingston branch line. By 1908 another branch had been completed via McNab to Waikaka.  The extension of the railways established Gore as an important hub and had a significant effect on its development.[ref]http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/Cyc04Cycl-fig-Cyc04Cycl0771a.html

By 1879, the “Ensign” newspaper was being published in the town, followed in 1887 by the rival “Standard”.

===Becomes a borough===

In 1885 Gore was constituted a borough and in 1890 Gordon, by now commonly known as East Gore, amalgamated with Gore.http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/G/Gore/Gore/en  “Encyclopaedia of New Zealand 1966“.

The establishment of the Gore Electric Light & Power Syndicate led in 1894 to Gore becoming the third town in New Zealand to install a generator and provide a public electricity supply.Reilly, Helen: “Connecting the Country – New Zealand’s national grid 1886-2007”.

From the end of the Second World War until 1976 Gore enjoyed prosperity driven by record prices for agricultural produce which saw the town’s population rise from 5,000 in 1945 to 9,000 in 1976. By the late 1960s it was reputed to have the highest per-capita retail turnover of any New Zealand town.http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/G/Gore/Gore/en  Encyclopaedia of New Zealand 1966.

===Decline===

The farm sector went into decline after 1976 which led to a corresponding decline in the population. Related businesses also closed, including the town’s iconic cereal mill, which had processed oats and other grains since 1877.  Since 2000 prosperity has returned as large numbers of farms in the surrounding area were converted to dairy farms to take advantage of high prices for dairy produce. This growth has led to low unemployment in the town.
