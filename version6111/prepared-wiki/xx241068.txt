==About the house==

The building, at 604 H Street NW, standing three-and-one-half stories tall, was constructed by Jonathan T. Walker in 1843.Kauffmann, p. 412.  It has been described as being in the Early Republic or Federal style or in "vernacular Greek Revival" style.[tpl]cite web |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Mary E.

The building is [tpl]convert|23|ft|m[/tpl] wide, facing directly onto the sidewalk on south side of the street, and has a depth of [tpl]convert|36|ft|m[/tpl]. The building was altered in 1925 so that the first floor could be used as a commercial space.
John Surratt purchased the house from Augustus A. Gibson on December 6, 1853, and operated it as a boarding house. After her husband died in 1862, Mary Surratt chose to rent her tavern/residence in nearby Surrattsville, Maryland, to John M. Lloyd, a former Washington, D.C., policeman and Confederate sympathizer, and moved into the Washington boarding house.
In 1865, the military tribunal trying the conspirators of Lincoln's assassination heard testimony from residents at the boarding house that Surratt had regularly met with John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln conspirators at the house. Lloyd told the tribunal that he had been told by Surratt to provide field glasses and guns to Booth and co-conspirator David Herold. It was on the basis of this evidence that Surratt was convicted and sentenced to death. For her role as a member of the Abraham Lincoln assassination conspiracy plot, she became the first woman to be executed by the United States federal government.  She was executed by hanging.Farquhar, Michael. "The Haunting Tale of Mary Surratt; They Hanged Her in 1865. Did Her Ghost Escape the Gallows?", The Washington Post, October 31, 1991.
