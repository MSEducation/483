The School of Theology at the University of Auckland is an ecumenical provider of theological education working in partnership with a number of Colleges of Theology as a result of a Memorandum of Agreement. These include the Catholic Institute of Theology, St John's College and Trinity Methodist College. In 2008 the School hosted the International Congress for the Society of Biblical Literature. It also has a notable focus on doing public theology and offers numerous lectures and workshops to the public led by world class theologians such as Nico Koopman, Walter Brueggemann and Amy-Jill Levine.
In mid-2009 the decision was made to merge the School of Theology with the Faculty of Arts from the beginning of 2010.
