==Early government career==

In 1970, Healy was hired by Lowell Mayor Richard P. Howe to run his city hall office. That same year he earned his master's degree in educational administration from Lowell State College. Later that year he was named assistant city manager by city manager James Sullivan. When Sullivan departed Lowell for Cambridge in 1974, Healy served as acting city manager for one month. State Representative Paul Sheehy was chosen over Healy for the permanent job by the Lowell City Council after 53 ballots.[tpl]cite news|title=Sheehy named Lowell manager on 53d ballot|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=May 1, 1974[/tpl] After being passed over, Healy followed Sullivan to Cambridge to be deputy city manager.

Healy fought a controversial 13-year legal battle against charges of racial discrimination. In 1998, four city employees filed charges of racial discrimination. After two trials and repeated appeals, the City was found liable for retaliation, not discrimination, against one of the victims and was ordered to pay a $4.5 million judgment.[tpl]cite news|last=Irons|first=Meghan|title=Cambridge won't seek appeals in bias cases|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/08/20/cambridge_ends_appeals_in_ex_workers_discrimination_case/|accessdate=30 June 2013|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=20 August 2011[/tpl] With interest and fees, Cambridge paid a total of $8.3 million in this case. shortly thereafter, Cambridge settled of the other discrimination cases, the terms of which were not revealed.[tpl]cite news|last=Levy|first=Marc|title=First Monteiro, now final two civil rights law suits settled|url=http://www.cambridgeday.com/2011/10/13/first-monteiro-now-final-two-civil-rights-lawsuits-settled/|accessdate=30 Jun 2013|newspaper=Cambridge Day|date=13 October 2011[/tpl]
