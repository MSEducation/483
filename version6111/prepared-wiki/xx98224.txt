Edward Leon Budde (born November 2, 1940) was a star offensive guard of the American Football League and National Football League.

==High school and college==

A product of Denby High School in Detroit, Michigan, and later Michigan State University, Ed Budde was chosen as the number one draft pick of the American Football League's Kansas City Chiefs (then the Dallas Texans) in 1963.

==Kansas City Chiefs==

Ed Budde went on to play for the Chiefs for 14 years as the left offensive guard, longer than any other Chief except for punter Jerrel Wilson by one year. From 1963 to 1971, he did not miss a single start, playing in all 14 games. Budde was 6'5 and 260 pounds (118 kg) with an unusual stance, in that he put his left hand down instead of the usual right. His explosive blocks often sprung a running back loose or kept defenders away from Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson. At the heart of the Chiefs’ offensive line with Jim Tyrer at left offensive tackle, his overpowering presence helped the Chiefs win two American Football League Championships (1966 and 1969) and a world championship in Super Bowl IV after defeating the NFL's Minnesota Vikings 23-7, with Budde able to handle the opposing right defensive tackle, Hall-of-Famer, Alan Page. 
Budde was selected to the American Football League All-Star team in 1963, ‘66, ‘67, ‘68 and 1969, and played in six AFL All-Star games.  He was selected for the Sporting News AFL All-League team in 1969. Budde was the first offensive lineman to be selected by the Associated Press as an Offensive Player of the Week.
Budde, who retired after the 1976 season, is a member of the All-Time All-AFL Team First Team.  His son Brad Budde was an All-American at the University of Southern California and also played in the NFL for the Chiefs.
