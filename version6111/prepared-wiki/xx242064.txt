[[ISO 14064]]

CATEGORIES: ISO standards

The ISO 14064 standard (published in 2006) is part of the ISO 14000 series of International Standards for environmental management. The ISO 14064 standard provides governments, businesses, regions and other organisations with a complimentary set of tools for programs to quantify, monitor, report and verify greenhouse gas emissions. The ISO 14064 standard supports organisations to participate in both regulated and voluntary programs such as emissions trading schemes and public reporting using a globally recognised standard.

==Structure of Standard==

The Standard is published in three parts:See http://www.iso.org/
ISO 14064-3:2006 specifies requirements for selecting GHG validators/verifiers, establishing the level of assurance, objectives, criteria and scope, determining the validation/verification approach, assessing GHG data, information, information systems and controls, evaluating GHG assertions and preparing validation/verification statements.
The principles behind ISO 14064 have been used in national calculation methodologies such as the UK's Carbon Trust Standard.See http://www.carbontruststandard.com/
