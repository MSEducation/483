==Controversy==

In April 2007, Wood acceded to pressure from Chinese officials not to attend an international cultural show by Divine Performing Arts, which contained scenes depicting the oppression of people who practice the Falun Gong spiritual system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0704/S00035.htm |title=N Shore Mayor succumbs to China Consulate pressure | Scoop News |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=2007-04-03 |accessdate=2010-07-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://en.epochtimes.com/news/7-4-4/53676.html |title=Epoch Times | Chinese Consulate Interferes With Cultural Show |publisher=En.epochtimes.com |date=2007-04-04 |accessdate=2010-07-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Published: 6:22 pm Thursday 5 April 2007 |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/423466/1050171 |title=Wood pulls out of Chinese event | NATIONAL News |publisher=Tvnz.co.nz |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2010-07-28[/tpl]
Wood was planning to attend the show with his wife, but after a phone call from the Chinese Consular General's office he backed out, and was quoted as saying:
 I don't want to get involved in internal People's Republic of China politics but I also want to maintain a reasonable relationship with the People's Republic of China. They said that show was involved in Falun Gong, they indicated Falun Gong, and I don't know what the true impact of that is, but it obviously has some concerns for them.
I had indicated that I probably would go to the show, but I'm not going to cause an international kerfuffle by going to something that I don't know anything about. I don't know anything about the Falun Gong or whatever it means. I am a mayor of a city not an international diplomat and I haven't really got the time to analyse the thing out.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] 
A journalist who did attend a Falun Gong show in Auckland reported being harried and felt he was "used."  He left the performance at the interval.The gospel truth: Falun Gong | Facebook
