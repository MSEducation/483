Husborne Crawley is a small village and civil parish in Bedfordshire, located close to Junction 13 of the M1 motorway. The village touches the borders of the Woburn Abbey estate on one side, and the village of Aspley Guise on the other. It has a small church and a primary school, and a nineteenth-century manor house in its own grounds, known as Crawley Park. The Crawley Park estate is privately owned, and features some extremely well preserved wooden-framed mediaeval cottages.
