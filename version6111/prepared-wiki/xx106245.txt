The castle, of which only ruins remain, was the scene of a murder in the 17th century. The beautiful Dianne de Roussan was killed by her husband's brothers, who wanted her large fortune. They were caught and subsequently executed.
Ganges became prosperous from the manufacture of fine silk stockings during the reign of Louis XIV. Natural silk was replaced by artificial, and later by nylon, and cottage industry gave way to factories; half a dozen or so still produce high quality stockings.
In August 1944, German forces unsuccessfully tried to force a way down the Hérault River valley through Ganges; they were repelled by the defence of the Aigoual-Cévennes maquis.Languedoc, Rousillon, Tarn Gorges.
