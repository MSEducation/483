==History==

Tomis (also called Tomi) was a Greek colony in the province of Scythia Minor on the Black Sea shore, founded around 600 BC for commercial exchanges with the local Getic populations. The name may likely be derived from Greek Τομή meaning cutpiece, section.
According to one myth dating from Antiquity, found in the Bibliotheca, it was founded by Aeetes:
Another legend is recorded by Jordanes (after Cassiodorus), who ascribes the foundation of the city to a Getae queen (The origin and deeds of the Goths):
In 29 BC the Romans captured the region from the Odryses, and annexed it as far as the Danube, under the name of Limes Scythicus.
In AD 8, the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC-17) was banished here by Augustus, where he found his death eight years later. He laments his exile in Tomis in his poems: Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto. Tomis was "by his account a town located in a war-stricken cultural wasteland on the remotest margins of the empire".The Cambridge Companion to Ovid ed. Philip Hardie p.235.
A statue of Ovid stands in the Ovid Square (Piața Ovidiu) of Constanța, in front of the History Museum (the former City Hall).
A number of inscriptions found in the city and its vicinity show that Constanța lies where Tomis once stood.
The city was afterwards included in the Province of Moesia, and, from the time of Diocletian, in Scythia Minor, of which it was the metropolis. After the 5th century, Tomis fell under the rule of the Eastern Roman Empire. During Maurice's Balkan campaigns, Tomis was besieged by the Avars in the winter of 597/598.
Tomis was later renamed to Constantiana in honour of Constantia, the half-sister of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (274-337). The earliest known usage of this name was "Κωνστάντια" ("Constantia") in 950. The city lay at the seaward end of the Great Wall of Trajan, and has evidently been surrounded by fortifications of its own.
After successively becoming part of the Bulgarian Empire for over 500 years, and later of the independent principality of Dobrotitsa/Dobrotici and of Wallachia under Mircea I of Wallachia, Constanța fell under the Ottoman rule around 1419.
A railroad linking Constanța to Cernavodă was opened in 1860. In spite of damage done by railway contractors there are considerable remains of ancient masonry walls, pillars, etc. An impressive public building, thought to have originally been a port building, has been excavated, and contains the substantial remains of one of the longest mosaic pavements in the world.
In 1878, after the Romanian War of Independence, Constanța and the rest of Northern Dobruja were ceded by the Ottoman Empire to Romania. The city became Romania's main seaport and transit point for much of Romania's exports.
On October 22, 1916 (during World War I), the Central Powers (German, Turkish and Bulgarian troops) occupied Constanța.  According to the Treaty of Bucharest in May 1918, article 10.b (a treaty never ratified by Romania), Constanța remained under the joint control of the Central Powers.  Allied troops liberated the city in 1918 after the successful offensive on the Thessaloniki front knocked Bulgaria out of the war.
In the interwar years, the city became Romania's main commercial hub, so that by the 1930s over half of the national exports were going through the port. During World War II, when Romania joined the Axis powers, Constanța was one of the country's main targets for the Allied bombers. While the town was left relatively undamaged, the port suffered extensive damage, recovering only in the early 1950s.

==Geography==

Constanța is the administrative center of the county with the same name and the largest city in the EU Southeastern development region of Romania. The city is located on the Black Sea coast, having a beach length of [tpl]convert|13|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl]. Mamaia, an administrative district of Constanța, is the largest and most modern resort on the Romanian coast. Mineral springs in the surrounding area and sea bathing attract many visitors in the summer.

==Climate==

Constanța is one of the warmest cities in Romania. It has a moderate subtropical climate with considerable maritime and some continental influences. There are four distinct seasons during the year.
Summer (late May to mid September) is warm, dry and sunny with a July and August average of [tpl]convert|23|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The beginning of summer brings plenty of precipitation, but by early July the weather becomes settled and dry. Most summer days see a gentle breeze refreshing the daytime temperatures. Nights are warm and somewhat muggy because of the heat stored by the sea.
Autumn starts in mid or late September with warm and sunny days. September can be warmer than June, owing to the heat accumulated by the Black Sea. The first frost occurs on average in mid November.
Winter is much balmier compared to other cities in southern Romania. Snow is not abundant but the weather can be very windy and unpleasant. Winter arrives much later than in the interior and December weather is often mild with high temperatures reaching [tpl]convert|8|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] - [tpl]convert|12|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Average January temperature is [tpl]convert|1|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Winter storms when the sea becomes particularly treacherous are a common occurrence between December and March.
Spring arrives early but it's quite cool. Often in April and May the Black Sea coast is one of the coolest places in Romania found at an altitude lower than [tpl]convert|500|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl].
4 of the warmest 7 years since 1889 occurred after the year 2000 (2000, 2001, 2007 and 2008). The winter and the summer of 2007 were respectively the warmest and the second warmest in recorded history with monthly averages for January (+6.5°C) and June (+23.0°C) breaking all-time records. Overall 2007 was the warmest year since 1889 when weather recording began.

==Economy==

As of 1878, Constanța was defined as a "poor Turkish fishing village." As of 1920, it was called "flourishing," and was known for exporting oil and cereals.[tpl]cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=77|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/77/[/tpl]
Constanța is one of Romania's main industrial, commercial and tourist centers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ghidulturistic.ro/zone.php?j=13|title=GhidTuristic.Ro: Județul Constanța|accessdate=2 December 2008|language=română[/tpl] During the first half of 2008, some 3,144 new companies were established in Constanța and its neighbouring localities, a number surpassed only in Bucharest and Cluj County.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cugetliber.ro/1218661200/articol/24287/constanta-are-3144-de-firme-noi-in-primele-sase-luni-din-2008/|title=Cuget Liber: Constanța are 3.144 de firme noi, în primele șase luni din 2008|accessdate=2 December 2008|language=română[/tpl] The Port of Constanța is the largest on the Black Sea and the fourth largest in Europe.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eosnap.com/snapshots/port-of-constanta-romania-on-the-black-sea/ |title=Port of Constanța Ranking |accessdate=|work= |publisher=www.eosnap.com |date=2010-10-19 [/tpl] The city also boasts a comparably large shipyard.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.snc.ro/index.php?page=about_us|title=Șantierul Naval Constanța: Despre noi|accessdate=2 December 2008[/tpl]
Tourism has been an increasingly important economic activity in recent years. Although Constanța has been promoted as a seaside resort since the time of Carol I, the development of naval industry had a detrimental effect on the city's beaches.[tpl]cite book|last=Juler|first=Caroline|title=Rumunia|series=Przewodniki National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic Polska|language=poloneză[/tpl] Nevertheless, due to its proximity to other major tourist destinations, Constanța receives a significant number of visitors every year, who discover and visit the city's monuments and attractions. Also, Constanța is a centre of commerce and education, both of which significantly contribute to the local economy.

==Transport==

The opening, in 1895, of the railway to Bucharest, which crosses the Danube by a bridge at Cernavodă, brought Constanța a considerable transit trade in grain and petroleum, which are largely exported; coal and coke head the list of imports, followed by machinery, iron goods, and cotton and woollen fabrics.
The A2 motorway provides a rapid road link between Constanța and Bucharest, while the A4 motorway acts as the city's outer traffic ring, diverting heavy traffic to and from the city port and to Mangalia.
The city is served by the Mihail Kogălniceanu International Airport.
Port of Constanța includes Constanța North Port and Constanța South Port, is the 4th largest in Europe and is protected by breakwaters, with a lighthouse at the entrance, is well defended from the North winds, but those from the South, South-East, and South-West prove sometimes highly dangerous. The Black Sea squadron of the Romanian fleet is stationed here. A large canal (the Danube-Black Sea Canal) connects the Danube River to the Black Sea at Constanța.
Constanța's public transport system is run by Regia Autonomă de Transport în Comun Constanța (RATC), and consists of 23 all year round bus lines, and 1 summer tourist sightseeing double decker open roof bus line. In the early 2000s, the city bought 130 new MAZ buses, replacing the aging DAC buses. All of its bus fleet is currently made up of buses from the 200-2008 period, which are distinctly painted in bright colors, such as pink, yellow and green. There are also The double decker Volvo buses that run in the summertime provide access to and from the city's resort. As of October 2013 the cost of 1 ticket is 3 RON.Tramway lines were active until the early 2000s. The cars were almost 25 years old and with lack of maintenance they become slow and noisy so the lines were removed. As of July 2009 all the tram lines have been decommissioned and replaced with long-wheelbase buses. Two trolley bus lines were active until the late 2000s - also decommissioned and replaced by buses. There are also plenty lines of private mini buses which run along longer and more intricate lines. The price of a minibus ticket, as of October 2013, varies between 1 and 2 RON depending on operator.
