==Career==

Sheridan was born in Stretford, Lancashire. After starting out in non-league football, he signed for Barnsley in 1993 and helped them win promotion to the Premier League in 1997. He played for them in their only top flight season to date (1997–98) and also helped them reach an FA Cup quarter-final that year. He featured as a substitute in Barnsley's shock FA Cup win over Manchester United in the fifth round. 
In 1999 he was transferred to Wigan Athletic where he played 58 games and scored three goals, enduring two successive play-off failures in Division Two (one in the final) before linking up with his brother, John at Wigan's local rivals Oldham Athletic. He left Oldham Athletic for Clyde of Scotland in 2004.
Sheridan spent one season at Clyde, scoring twice in 29 games, before moving to St. Johnstone, where he made 42 goalless appearances in 18 months, after which he moved south of the border to play non-League football for Barrow. He was hired as joint manager alongside Dave Bayliss in December 2007 following a successful run as caretaker managers, and took the team to promotion to the Conference National following a twenty game unbeaten run. Sheridan continued to play for the club whilst managing, as Barrow managed to retain their Conference National status in the 2008/09 season.
Along with Bayliss he continued the good work with the Cumbrian side in 2009–10 as Barrow yet again stayed up finishing a respectable 15th. Barrow also won the FA Trophy beating league champions Stevenage Borough 2–1 at Wembley Stadium to claim the non-league knockout competition. He continued to be a regular during the 2010–11 season, as Barrow secured their longest spell in the Conference National since its formation as the Alliance Premier League in 1979. 
In the 2011–12 season Sheridan made only two league appearances as a player for Barrow, whilst the club enjoyed mid-table stability in the league. Following allegations made against Sheridan, he was suspended from Barrow on 3 February 2012.[tpl]cite news|title=Sheridan Faces D–Day Over Suspension|url=http://www.nwemail.co.uk/afc/news/sheridan-faces-d-day-over-suspension-1.923449?referrerPath=home|accessdate=11 February 2012|newspaper=North West Evening Mail[/tpl] It was announced on 11 February that he had left Barrow by mutual consent, with Darren Bayliss remaining as sole manager of the club.
