</ref> The Army's commander General, [[Mike Jeffery]], was against the deployment of 2,000 troops to Afghanistan, arguing that "We did not have strategic lift, we lacked certain strategic enablers, certain types of intelligence, certain types of communications. Our logistics capability was weak", and that at most Canada had the capacity to support only 500 troops in Afghanistan.<ref name="http">
</ref> General Jeffery's views were ignored, and Canada sent 2,000 soldiers to Afghanistan in the summer of 2003.<ref name="http"/> In December 2003, it emerged that the Department of National Defense had prepared plans for Canada to send as many as 800 Canadian troops to Iraq if the UN Security Council had authorized it; however, a UN request for an increased deployment of Canadian soldiers to Afghanistan removed this option from the table.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] This led some of Chrétien's anti-war critics on the left to accuse the Prime Minister of never really being fully opposed to the war.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Nonetheless, Canada was the first non-member of the US-led coalition to provide significant financial aid to the post-war reconstruction effort, relative to Canada's size. This move allowed Canadian companies to bid on reconstruction contracts.
To the general public, Chrétien maintained a high approval rating near the end of his term due to several developments. The government under Chrétien's prime ministership also introduced a new and far-reaching Youth Criminal Justice Act in April 2003, which replaced the old Young Offenders Act, and changed the way youths were prosecuted for crimes in Canada. The cooperation of federal, provincial, and municipal governments enabled Vancouver to win the bid to host the 2010 Winter Olympics. The election victory of federalist Jean Charest in April 2003 was widely seen across the country that the Quebec sovereignty movement was in retreat, through Charest's victory had more to do with a tired out and disunited PQ government being rejected by voters than Chrétien's "tough love" programme of the 1990s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] His decision not to participate in the Iraq war was popular with a large majority of Canadians but was also criticized as potentially hurting Canadian business interests with the US. On 30 April 2003, the Globe and Mail newspaper ran an editorial that praised Chrétien's leadership and claimed "...we are now the best governed country in the Group of Eight".Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking 2003 page 428.
Due to mounting pressure from the Martin camp, Chrétien no longer saw his February 2004 resignation date as tenable. His final sitting in the House of Commons took place on November 6, 2003. He made an emotional farewell to the party on November 13 at the 2003 Liberal leadership convention. The following day, Martin was elected his successor. U2 lead singer Bono attended the convention and made a speech, joking "I'm the only thing these two can agree upon."
On 12 December 2003, Chrétien formally resigned as prime minister, handing power over to Martin. Chrétien joined the law firm of Heenan Blaikie on 5 January 2004, as counsel. The firm announced he would work out of its Ottawa offices four days per week and make a weekly visit to the Montreal office.
In early 2004, there occurred much in-fighting within the Liberal Party with several Liberal MPs associated with Chrétien such as Sheila Copps and Charles Caccia losing their nomination battles against Martin loyalists.
