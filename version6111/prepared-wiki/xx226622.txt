This leaf-footed bug is one of the two major pests of physic nut plants in Nicaragua.Grimm, C. and F. Guharay. (1998). Control of leaf-footed bug Leptoglossus zonatus and shield-backed bug Pachycoris klugii with entomopathogenic fungi. Biocontrol Science and Technology 8:3 365-76. In Honduras, where the bug is known commonly as chinche patona (large-legged bug), it is a minor garden pest.Schaefer, C. W. and A. R. Panizzi. (2000). Heteroptera of Economic Importance. CRC Press pg. 369. ISBN 0-8493-0695-7 It is a pest of many crops in Brazil and it may transmit the plant pathogen Herpetomonas macgheei, a trypanosomatid protozoan. It breeds in pomegranate and desert willow trees, and the gregarious bright orange nymphs aggregate there. It is a serious pest of satsuma oranges in Louisiana, causing damage by feeding and by transmitting the pathogenic yeast Nematospora coryli.
Biological pest control agents found to be effective against this insect include the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana.
