[[Datafork TrueType]]

CATEGORIES: Font formats

Datafork TrueType is a font wrapper used on Apple Macintosh computers running Mac OS X. It is a TrueType suitcase with the resource map in the data fork, rather than the resource fork as had been the case in Mac OS 9. It uses the file extension .dfont.

==Mac OS X Snow Leopard==

In Mac OS X 10.6, released August 28, 2009, the dfont format is being (gradually) replaced with the TrueType Collection format.http://www.prepressure.com/fonts/basics/snow-leopard-fonts
