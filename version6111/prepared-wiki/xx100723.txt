.gl is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet for Greenland. The domain is available for Internet services world-wide and registrations are handled by ICANN accredited domain name registrars.
The domain name has sometimes been marketed as a symbol standing for "good luck", "graphics library", Galicia or the Galician language, or Gloucestershire.
In December 2009, Google released a URL shortener service using the domain hack goo.gl.
In April 2013, the registry unilaterally voluntarily suspended resolution of thepiratebay.gl, intended to be a new primary domain name for Bittorrent search engine The Pirate Bay.[tpl]cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/new-pirate-bay-greenland-domains-about-to-be-seized-130410 |title=New Pirate Bay Greenland Domains (About to be) Seized |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2013-05-13[/tpl]
