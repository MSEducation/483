==History==

===19th-century origins===

Founder Henry J. Heinz began packing foodstuffs on a small scale at Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1869. There he founded Heinz Noble & Company with a friend, L. Clarence Noble, and began marketing horseradish. The company went bankrupt in 1875, but the following year Heinz founded another company, F & J Heinz, with his brother John Heinz and a cousin Frederick Heinz. One of this company's first products was tomato ketchup.
The company continued to grow, and in 1888 Heinz bought out his other two partners and reorganized the company as the H. J. Heinz Company. Its slogan, "57 varieties", was introduced by Heinz in 1896. Inspired by an advertisement he saw while riding an elevated train in New York City (a shoe store boasting "21 styles"), Heinz picked the number more or less at random because he liked the sound of it, selecting 7 specifically because, as he put it, of the "psychological influence of that figure and of its enduring significance to people of all ages."[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

===20th century===

H. J. Heinz was incorporated in 1905, and Heinz served as its first president, remaining in the position for the rest of his life. Under his leadership, the company pioneered processes for sanitary food preparation, leading a successful lobbying effort in favor of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. During World War I, he worked with the Food Administration.[tpl]Cite Collier's|Heinz, Henry John|year=1921[/tpl]
In 1969, Tony O'Reilly joined the company's UK subsidiary, soon becoming its managing director; he 
moved to Pittsburgh in 1971 when he was promoted to Senior Vice President for the North America and Pacific region, and by 1973, R. Burt Gookin and Jack Heinz made him COO and President.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  He became CEO in 1979 and chairman in 1987,[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] succeeding Jack and becoming the first non-family member to hold that post. 
Between 1981 and 1991, Heinz returned 28% annually, doubling the Standard & Poor's average annual return for those years.[tpl]cite web| title= Bottled Up Profits aren't flowing like they used to at packaged-goods companies.

The decline was also attributed to an inadequate response to broad demographic changes in the United States, particularly the growth in population among Hispanic Americans and African Americans.
Tony O'Reilly left Heinz in 1998 after issues with the company's performance, and challenges from corporate governance groups and pension funds including CalPERS.Business Week, September 15, 1997, Lead cover story: "The CEO and the Board" He was succeeded by his deputy, William R.

Billionaire Nelson Peltz initiated a proxy battle during 2006, culminating in a vote to place Peltz's nominees on the Board, which, depending on how many seats the dissident group received after the final vote tally, would displace some of the current board members. After the final vote, 2 out of the 5 nominees joined the Heinz Board. The new members of the board were Nelson Peltz and Matthew Craig Walsh.
In June 2008, Heinz began an advertising campaign in the UK for their new 'New York Deli Mayo' products. The advertisement featured a family with the mother replaced by a male New York deli worker. The advert ended with the father and the 'mother' kissing. This drew 200 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4205422.ece|work=The Times|title=Heinz pulls mayonnaise ad over gay kiss furore|accessdate= June 25, 2008 | location=London | first=Jenny | last=Booth | date=June 24, 2008[/tpl] On June 24, 2008 Heinz took the decision to withdraw the advertisement, which was initially supposed to run for five weeks. A spokesperson for Heinz stated that the reason for the withdrawal was recognition of the fact that some of its customers had concerns about the advertisement's content.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jun/24/asa.advertising|work=The Guardian|title=Heinz pulls ad showing men kissing|accessdate= June 25, 2008 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | date=June 24, 2008[/tpl]
