The central idea of the book posits that of these two technologies, it was the telegraph that was the more significant, since the ability to communicate globally at all in real-time was a qualitative shift, while the change brought on by the modern Internet was merely a quantitative shift according to Standage.[tpl]cite news|title=Victorian Internet|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1065537|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=NPR|date=October 19, 1999[/tpl]

The book describes to general readers how some of the uses of telegraph in commercial, military, and social communication were, in a sense, analogous to modern uses of the internet. A few rather unusual stories are related, about couples who fell in love and even married over the wires, criminals who were caught through the telegraph, and so on.
The culture which developed between telegraph operators also had some rather unexpected affinities with the modern Internet. Both cultures made or make use of complex text coding and abbreviated language slang, both required network security experts, and both attracted criminals who used the networks to commit fraud, hack private communications, and send unwanted messages.[tpl]cite news|last=Stroh|first=Michael|title=The Victorian net; The electric telegraph was the 1890s version of the Internet|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/37662504.html?dids=37662504:37662504&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec+28%2C+1998&author=MICHAEL+STROH&pub=The+Sun&desc=The+Victorian+net%3B+The+electric+telegraph+was+the+1890s+version+of+the+Internet&pqatl=google|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=The Sun - Baltimore, Md.|date=Dec 28, 1998[/tpl]
