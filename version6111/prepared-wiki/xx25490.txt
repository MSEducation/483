Robert Rick McCammon (born July 17, 1952) is an American novelist from Birmingham, Alabama. One of the influential names in the late 1970s–early 1990s American horror literature boom, by 1991 McCammon had three New York Times bestsellers (The Wolf's Hour, Stinger, and Swan Song) and 5 million books in print.As seen in foreword to Mine, ISBN 0-671-73944-1 Pocket Books paperback[ref]Stefan Dziemianowicz, "McCammon, Robert R(ick)"

His parents are Jack, a musician, and Barbara Bundy McCammon. After his parents' divorce, McCammon lived with his grandparents in Birmingham.  He received a B.A. in Journalism from the University of Alabama in 1974. McCammon currently resides in Birmingham. He has a daughter, Skye, with his former wife, Sally Sanders.
After  the release of Gone South,  McCammon was dropped by his publisher. After a long hiatus which resulted from the reorganization of the publishing industry  and McCammon’s personal depression and soul searching,http://www.robertmccammon.com/articles/mccammon-bio.html he returned to the publishing world with Speaks the Nightbird, the first book in the Matthew Corbett series. [tpl]As of|2008[/tpl], his plans are to continue with the series.
In 1985, McCammon's story "Nightcrawlers" was adapted into an episode of The New Twilight Zone.
Like Dean Koontz, McCammon also now refuses to let his first novels (up to and including They Thirst) be republished because, while not disliking the books, he does not feel that they are up to the standards of his later works. He wrote that he feels he was allowed to learn how to write in public, and therefore has decided to officially retire his earlier works.Why are some of McCammon's novels out-of-print? However, Baal, Bethany's Sin, and The Night Boat were recently re-released by Subterranean Press as limited edition novels.
