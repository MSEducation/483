Sai Sha Road is a road in Hong Kong, which links together from Sai Kung District to Sha Tin District in the New Territories. The road also passes through some area along the coast of the Tolo Harbour in northern Sai Kung Peninsula that is under the administration of the Tai Po District. Before the area of Sha Tin New Town extended to Ma On Shan, the name of the road was called Nai Chung Access Road. The western end of Sai Sha Road was located in Nai Chung Bus Terminus in the early and mid-1980s until the first two housing estates in Ma On Shan was started to develop.
The western end of Sai Sha Road is located in the urbanized town centre of Ma On Shan in the Sha Tin District. Going towards the east direction, it then passes by some suburban areas  such as Wu Kai Sha (烏溪沙), Cheung Muk Tau (樟木頭), Sai O (西澳), Nai Chung (泥涌), Mak Pin (麥邊), Che Ha (輋下), Ma Ku Lam (馬牯纜), Tai Tung (大洞), Tin Liu (田寮), Nga Yiu Tau (瓦瑤頭), Kei Ling Ha Lo Wai (企嶺下老圍), Kei Ling Ha San Wai (企嶺下新圍) and Wong Chuk Wan (黃竹灣), until it reaches Sai Kung Town. 
Sai Sha Road has been well known of being narrow and precipitous in the suburban portion. Therefore, bus companies usually adopt buses of shorter length, such as the 10.6-metre version of the Dennis Trident model, for the bus routes that pass through such portions of the Sai Sha Road. The Government is planning to widen the road. The widening work in the area around the Wu Kai Sha Railway Station, which was opened in 2004, has already been finished.
Here are some of the bus routes that go via the suburban portion of the Sai Sha Road.
