Germantown is an urbanized census-designated place in Montgomery County, Maryland. With a population of 86,395 as of the 2010 United States Census, Germantown is the third most populous place in Maryland, after the city of Baltimore, and the census-designated place of Columbia, Maryland. If Germantown were to incorporate as a city, it would become the second largest incorporated city in Maryland, after Baltimore.[tpl]cite web |title= Maryland Trend Report 2: State and Complete Places |date= March 8, 2011 |work= Missouri Census Data Center |publisher= Missouri State Library, Missouri Secretary of State |url= http://mcdc.missouri.edu/webrepts/pl94trends/Maryland_stplace2.html [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Germantown Looking to Incorporate: Area Would Be County's Largest Municipality|last=Burke|first=Garance|work=The Washington Post|date=July 17, 2003|page=T03|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/409473291/13BC306D48DA65EAB3/1?accountid=46320[/tpl] Germantown is located approximately [tpl]convert|25|mi[/tpl] outside of the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C., and is an important part of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.

Three exits to Interstate 270 are less than one mile away, the Maryland Area Regional Commuter train is within walking distance, and the Germantown Transit Center that provides Ride On shuttle service to the Shady Grove station of the Washington Metro's Red Line.
Germantown has the assigned ZIP codes of 20874 and 20876 for delivery and 20875 for post office boxes. It is the most populous Germantown in Maryland and is the only "Germantown, Maryland" recognized by the United States Postal Service, although there are others: one in Anne Arundel County, one in Baltimore County, and one in Worcester County.[tpl]cite web| url=http://geonames.usgs.gov| title=Geographic Names Information System (GNIS): Germantown, Maryland| publisher=U.S. Geological Survey| accessdate=February 22, 2012[/tpl]

==Etymology==

In the 1830s and 1840s, the central business area was focused around the intersection of Liberty Mill Road and Clopper Road. Several German immigrants set up shop at the intersection and the town became known as "German Town", even though most residents of the town were of English or Scottish descent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.germantownmdhistory.org/?q=node/2|work=Germantown Historical Society|author=Germantown Historical Society|title=Germantown's History, A Brief Overview|quote=The crossroads became known as "German town" because of the heavy German accents of these people. The name has stuck even though a majority of the land-owners in the area were of English or Scottish descent.|accessdate=March 10, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

===19th century===

====Early education====

Germantown did not have a public school until after the end of the American Civil War. During that time, education was handled at homes. In 1868, a one-room schoolhouse was built on Maryland Route 118, near Black Rock Road, which hosted children from both Germantown and neighboring Darnestown. In 1883, a larger one-room schoolhouse was built closer to Clopper Road. Another, newer school was constructed in 1910, on what is now the site of Germantown Elementary School. This school had four rooms, with two downstairs and two upstairs, with each room housing two grade levels. After the eighth grade, the students would head via train to nearby Rockville, for further education.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.germantownmdhistory.org/?q=node/2|author=Germantown Historical Society|work=Germantown Historical Society|title=Germantown's History, A Brief Overview|quote=There was no public school in Germantown until after the Civil War.

In 1883 a larger one-room school was built closer to Clopper Road to teach the children of Germantown. Another new school was built in 1910 on the present site of Germantown Elementary school. This school had four rooms--two downstairs and two upstairs--each room housing two grades. After eighth grade the children rode the train to attend high-school in Rockville.|accessdate=March 10, 2013[/tpl]

====American Civil War====

Although it avoided much of the physical destruction that ravaged other cities in the region, the American Civil War was still a cause of resentment and division among residents of Germantown. Many Germantown residents, particularly those of German ancestry, were against slavery and had sons fighting for the Union Army. In contrast, other residents of Germantown, particularly those of English ancestry, owned slaves, and even those who weren't slave-owners had sons fighting for the Confederate Army. As a result, many people in Germantown, who were once on friendly terms with each other, made an effort not to interact with each other, such as switching churches, or frequenting a store or mill miles away from the ones they'd normally do business with.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.germantownmdhistory.org/?q=node/2|author=Germantown Historical Society|work=Germantown Historical Society|quote=The Civil War took a terrible toll on Germantown, not because there was any actual fighting here, but because of the animosities between neighbors that it created. Many of the families of German descent were against slavery and had sons fighting in the Union army. Many of the families of English descent owned slaves and even many who didn't had sons fighting in the Confederate army. Many people who had formerly been friendly went out of their way to not have to deal with each other, some changing churches, or going to a mill or store miles distant from the one they usually used.|title=Germantown's History, A Brief Overview|accessdate=March 10, 2013[/tpl]
Late in the summer and fall of 1861, there were more than twenty thousand Union Army soldiers camped to the west of Germantown, in neighboring Darnestown and Poolesville. Occasionally, these soldiers would come to Germantown and frequent the stores there. In September 1862, and in June of 1863, several regiments of Union Army soldiers marched north on Maryland Route 355, on their way to the Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of Gettysburg, respectively. In July 1864, General Jubal Early led his army of Confederate soldiers down Maryland Route 355 to attack the Union capital of Washington, D.C. Throughout the course of the war, Confederate raiders would often come through the Germantown area. Local farmers in the Germantown area lost horses and other livestock to both Union and Confederate armies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.germantownmdhistory.org/?q=node/2|author=Germantown Historical Society|work=Germantown Historical Society|quote=In the late summer and fall of 1861 there were more than 20,000 Union soldiers camped to the west of Germantown in the Darnestown and Poolesville areas.

=====Assassination of Abraham Lincoln=====

On April 20, 1865, George Atzerodt, a co-conspirator in the Abraham Lincoln assassination, was captured in Germantown. He was assigned by John Wilkes Booth to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson, but lost his nerve and fled Washington, D.C., on the night of the Lincoln assassination. He was captured at his cousin Hartman Richter's farm in Germantown. Atzerodt was hanged on July 7, 1865 along with Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, and David Herold in Washington, D.C.[tpl]cite book|last=Kauffman|first=M.|authorlink=|title=American Brutus|url=|accessdate=|year=2004|publisher=Random House|location=|isbn=0-375-75974-3|page=|pages=282–284[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.germantownmdhistory.org/?q=node/2|author=Germantown Historical Society|work=Germantown Historical Society|title=Germantown's History, A Brief Overview|quote=George Adzerodt had come to the town with his family from Prussia when he was about nine years old. When he was about 16 his father moved the family to Virginia, but George still had many friends and relatives in Germantown. He was living in Port Tobacco during the Civil War, and supplementing his meager income as a carriage painter by smuggling people across the Potomac River in a row boat. This clandestine occupation brought him into contact with John Seuratt and John Wilkes Booth and he was drawn into a plot to kidnap President Lincoln. On April 14, 1865 John Wilkes Booth gave George Adzerodt a gun and told him that he was to kill the vice president, Andrew Johnson. George panicked when he found out that Booth had shot President Lincoln and made his way to his cousin's, Hartman Richter's, house in Germantown to hide. He was discovered there by soldiers three days after the assassination and, although he had never actually committed a crime, was hanged with other conspirators on July 7.|accessdate=March 10, 2013[/tpl]

====The Liberty Mill====

The wooden structure of the Bowman Brothers Mill fell victim to a fire in 1914, but four years later, the owners were back in business again, selling the mill to the Liberty Milling Company, a brand new corporation. Augustus Selby was the first owner and manager of the new Liberty Mill, which opened in 1918. Electricity was brought into Liberty Mill and also served the homes and businesses nearby, making Germantown the first area in the northern portion of Montgomery County to receive electricity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.germantownmdhistory.org/?q=node/2|work=Germantown Historical Society|author=Germantown Historical Society|quote=Fire engulfed the old wooden structure of the Bowman Brothers Mill in 1914, but four years later they were in business again and sold the mill to a brand new corporation--the Liberty Milling Company.

In 1935, professional baseball player Walter Perry Johnson, who played as a pitcher for the Washington Senators (now the Minnesota Twins), purchased a farm on what is now the site of Seneca Valley High School. Used as a dairy farm, Johnson lived there with his five children and his mother, as his wife died, until his death in 1946.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.germantownmdhistory.org/?q=node/2|author=Germantown Historical Society|work=Germantown Historical Society|title=Germantown's History, A Brief Overview|quote=Johnson bought his dream farm in Germantown in 1935 and lived here with his five children and his mother, his wife having passed away, until his death in 1946.

===1940s===

"Feed the Liberty Way" was used as a slogan for Liberty Mill which, with eight silos, became the second largest mill in all of Maryland, supplying flour to the United States Army during World War II. Cornmeal and animal feed were also manufactured at Liberty Mill, and a store at the mill sold specialty mixes, such as pancake and muffin mix.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.germantownmdhistory.org/?q=node/2|work=Germantown Historical Society|author=Germantown Historical Society|quote="Feed the Liberty Way" was the slogan for the mill which, with its 8 silos, became the second largest mill in Maryland and supplied flour for the army during World War II.

====U.S. Atomic Energy Commission====

In January 1958, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was relocated from its location in downtown Washington, D.C. to Germantown, which was considered far enough from the city to withstand a Soviet nuclear attack.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.er.doe.gov/SC-80/trail/history.htm|title=Redirection Page|work=U.S. DOE Office of Science (SC)[/tpl] The facility now operates as an administration complex for the U.S. Department of Energy and headquarters for its Office of Biological and Environmental Research.

===1960s===

====Early development and Master Plan====

Marshall Davis owned a farm located where Interstate 270 and Germantown Road intersect today.[tpl]cite news |title= Once-Rural Germantown Growing Up |first= Felicity |last= Barringer |work= The Washington Post |date= September 19, 1977 |page= A1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/146738794/pageviewPDF/13BC314A954305F2CA3/12?accountid=46320 [/tpl] After Interstate 270 divided his farm in two, Davis decided to sell the last of his land to the International Development Corporation for about $1,300 per acre in 1955. Fairchild-Hiller Corporation bought the land for about $4,000 per acre in 1964, and it built an industrial park on the land four years later. Harry Unglesee and his family sold their farm near Hoyles Mill Road for less than $1,000 per acre in 1959. Other farmers soon sold their land to developers and speculators as well.
The Germantown Master Plan was adopted in 1967.[tpl]cite news |title= Germantown Master Plan Boasts a Time Schedule |work= The Washington Post |date= August 11, 1973 |page= E21 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/148394807/13BC314A954305F2CA3/9?accountid=46320 [/tpl] The plan for the [tpl]convert|17|sqmi|km2|adj=on[/tpl] area included a dense central downtown area and less dense development surrounding it.[tpl]cite news|title=Revision Approved Of Germantown Plan: 'New Town' Plan Change Is Approved|first=Alice|last=Bonner|work=The Washington Post|date=January 9, 1974|page=C1|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/146220112/13BC314A954305F2CA3/11?accountid=46320[/tpl] In 1974, the Montgomery County Council approved an amended plan written by the Montgomery County Planning Board. The amended plan included a downtown area and six separate villages, each comprising smaller neighborhoods with schools, shopping areas, and public facilities. The amended plan also included the construction of a third campus for Montgomery College near the downtown area.

===1970s===

During the 1970s, Wernher von Braun, a German rocket scientist during World War II, worked for the aerospace company Fairchild Industries, which had offices in Germantown, as its Vice President for Engineering and Development. Von Braun worked at Fairchild Industries from July 1, 1972 until his death.
Following the end of World War II, the Liberty Mill went into disrepair, and was finally destroyed by an arsonist in 1971.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.germantownmdhistory.org/?q=node/2|work=Germantown Historical Society|author=Germantown Historical Society|quote=After the war the mill went into decline, and was burned by arson in 1971.|title=Germantown's History, A Brief Overview|accessdate=March 10, 2013[/tpl] In 1974, the completion of a sewer line helped the development and growth of Germantown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.germantownmdhistory.org/?q=node/2|author=Germantown Historical Society|work=Germantown Historical Society|title=Germantown's History, A Brief Overview|quote=The area felt a new surge of energy with the building of interstate 270 in the 1960s.

====Economic growth====

Since the early 1980s, Germantown has experienced rapid economic and population growth, both in townhouses and single-family dwellings, and an urbanized town center has been built. Germantown was the fastest growing zip code in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area and Maryland in 1986.[tpl]cite news|title=Germantown: Zip Code Seeking Identity; Montgomery Community's Dream Is Sidetracked by Economics|last=Meyer|first= Eugene L.|work=The Washington Post|date=March 17, 1987|page=A1|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/306866256/13BC314A954305F2CA3/3?accountid=46320[/tpl]

In March 2001, Germantown's only movie theater, the Sony 6, located at the Germantown Commons Shopping Center, closed down as part of a closure of 112 movie theaters across the United States by Loews Cineplex, leaving Germantown without a movie theater of its own. As a result, local residents frequented a movie theater in Kentlands or  one at The Rio in Gaithersburg. Over a year later, on May 3, 2002, the Hoyts Cinema 14, now the Regal Germantown Stadium 14, opened, and Germantown now had its own movie theater once again.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/gazette_archive/2002/200220/business/news/105310-1.html|title=Movie projectors are rolling once again in Germantown|last=Milton|first=Kristen|work=The Gazette|date=May 17, 2002|publisher=Post-Newsweek Media, Inc.|location=9030 Comprint Court, Gaithersburg, Maryland|accessdate=September 29, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/gazette_archive/2002/200219/poolesville/news/103364-1.html|title=Projectors rolling in Town Center: New multiplex opens|location=9030 Comprint Court, Gaithersburg, Maryland|date=May 8, 2002|work=The Gazette|last=Milton|first=Kristen|publisher=Post-Newsweek Media, Inc.|accessdate=September 30, 2013[/tpl] A DSW footwear retail store now sits on the site of the former Sony 6 theater.

==Government==

The U.S. Department of Energy has its headquarters for the Office of Biological and Environmental Research in Germantown. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was moved from its location in downtown Washington, D.C. to the present-day U.S. Department of Energy building in Germantown, due to fears of a Soviet nuclear attack on the U.S. capital. At the time, Germantown was believed to be far enough from Washington, D.C. to avoid the worst effects of a nuclear strike on the city. The facility now operates as an administration complex for the U.S. Department of Energy.
