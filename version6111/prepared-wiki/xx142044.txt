VideoGamer.com (formerly known as Pro-G) is a London based website focused on video game news, reviews, previews and videos. It is privately owned and operated by Pro-G Media Ltd., and was launched in November 2004[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pro-gmedia.com/aboutus/history | title=History page on Pro-G Media corporate website | accessdate=2007-01-04[/tpl] by university friends Adam McCann and Tom Orry.
On October 6, 2008, VideoGamer.com launched a high-definition video service, capable of streaming 720p HD videos, which is claimed to be the first amongst UK games websites.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/videogamer-com-720p-hd-video-service-goes-on-air | title=VideoGamer.com launches UK's first 720p HD video service in conjunction with Far Cry 2 from Ubisoft | accessdate=2008-10-14[/tpl] The website is regularly updated with video content, most commonly consisting of video game reviews, comparisons, trailers, and gameplay clips, much of which is produced in-house.

==Community==

The website features a community section where members of the VideoGamer.com staff interact with the website's community and also answer any questions in relation to a specific game that they are having problems with. All questions are answered on the forum under the community section. Every month, the staff hold a 'Member of the Month' competition in which a regular member of the website's community is chosen to select a game from the website ShopTo.net. As well as this the user is given founder status in the website's forums.

==Regular features==

While the site is regularly maintained and tweaked, it also has several features that run weekly that give insight to that week in video gaming.

==Podcasts==

===VideoGamer.com Podcast===

In January 2009 the first episode of the VideoGamer.com podcast was released for download from the website and iTunes. Originally it was hosted by the then previews editor (later deputy editor) Neon Kelly and featured the editor Tom Orry, video and podcast producer Sebastian Ford (now of GameSpot) and deputy editor Wesley Yin-Poole (now of Eurogamer) with news editor James Orry making regular appearances. Newer members of the VideoGamer.com team have also been involved in recent shows, including Chris Bratt, Matthew Lees, Simon Miller and David Scammell.
The podcast was initially similar to other gaming podcasts but quickly evolved into the quiz format where the VideoGamer.com staff competed against each other to answer gaming related questions in a variety of rounds. The podcast continued to grow and by the 16th episode podcast punishments were introduced. These were awarded to the loser of the quiz and were usually something they had to eat or drink. VideoGamer.com's community are regularly involved in the podcast, with the team answering their questions on the show and sometimes having them take part in surveys to produce answers for the family fortunes inspired round, Forum Fortunes.

===Back On Topic Podcast===

In October 2009, to combat fears that the podcast was becoming less gaming related and focused more on humour, the VideoGamer.com Back On Topic podcast was released. This would have a more serious discussion on the world of gaming so that the 'Quizcast' could continue to stay how it was. The 'BOTcast' would be released on the Monday that followed the 'Quizcast's' Friday release.
