Highbury is a small town in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, located along the Great Southern Highway between Narrogin and Wagin. At the 2006 census, Highbury had a population of 493.[tpl]Census 2006 AUS|id=SSC54106|name=Highbury (State Suburb) |accessdate=14 July 2011|quick=on[/tpl]

==History==

Like many towns, Highbury came into existence with the construction of the Great Southern Railway, when a siding was built here in 1894. Originally called Wolwolling, it was gazetted under that name in 1905, but the local progress association complained that the name was too similar to others, and it was renamed to Highbury in 1906, presumably after one of any number of towns in England by that name.[tpl]LandInfo WA|c|H|2007-04-17[/tpl]

==Present day==

The town today is little more than a stop on the highway, with a store, tavern and hall utilised by the surrounding agricultural district in the southern Shire of Narrogin. A group called Highbury District Community Council report to council on issues affecting the area, and in 2006 successfully proposed the construction of a war memorial next to the hall to honour those from the district who had fought and died overseas.
