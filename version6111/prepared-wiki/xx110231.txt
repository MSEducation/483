In 1978, the port was expanded to include 35 berths (five of which were able to be used by the largest container ships at the time).  Today, the port has a depth of 13 metres (43 ft) has 9 gantry cranes and a capacity of 1,500,000 TEUs.
Today, Port Rashid provides berths for general cargo, RoRo and passenger vessels.  In the early 1980s, Port Rashid was supplemented by Port of Jebel Ali, which is further from the commercial centre of Dubai near the Abu Dhabi border.
Adjacent to the port are Dubai Drydocks and Dubai Maritime City.  Both of these facilities were built due to Port Rashid's proximity.  But, in January 2008, it was announced that the port would be redeveloped.[tpl]Cite news |title=Port Rashid will take up new role |url=http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/08/01/10/10180737.html |publisher=Gulf News |date=2008-01-10 |accessdate=2008-02-09[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |title=Masterplanners of the Universe |url=http://www.nakheel.com/News/2008_new_era/ |publisher=Nakheel |date=2008-01-20 |accessdate=2008-02-09[/tpl]  All cargo operations will move to Jebel Ali Port by the end of March 2008.  Port Rashid will turn into a cruise terminal.  Also, part of the port will be reclaimed by Nakheel to create "a vibrant mixed use urban waterfront" that will house 200,000 residents.
