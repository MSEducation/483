</ref> In the [[Book of Revelation]] its text belongs to the Byzantine text-type, but with a large number of unique textual variants, in close relationship to the [[Codex Vaticanus 2066|Uncial 046]] and [[Minuscule 61]], which appears to have been copied from it.<ref>[tpl]Cite book |last1=Metzger |first1=Bruce M. |authorlink1=Bruce M.

The text of Christ's agony at Gethsemane (Luke 22:43-44) is placed after Matt 26:39. The Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11) is placed after Luke 21. This is typical for the manuscripts of the Ferrar Group.Bruce M. Metzger, A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, 2nd edition, Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart 2001, p. 147.
In John 4:5 it reads Σιχαρ for Συχαρ.NA26, p. 255
In 2 Cor 11:17 it reads ανθρωπον for κυριον.NA26, p. 488.
Although there is no liturgical equipment in the codex, many of its various readings have arisen from lectionaries.

==History==

Wettstein and J. Rendel Harris dated the manuscript to the 14th century, C. R. Gregory to the 15th century. Currently it is dated by the INTF to the 15th century. Rendel Harris suggested that it was written by Emmanuel from Constantinople.
The manuscript was presented to George Neville, Archbishop of York (1465–1472). It once belonged to Richard Brinkley (or Brinkeley), who probably got it from Covenant of Grey Friars at Cambridge (like minuscule 61). Then it belonged to William Chark (or Charc), mentioned in marginal notes of codex 61. Then it belonged to Thomas Hayne, who in 1641 gave this codex with his other books to the Leicester Library.S. P. Tregelles, "An Introduction to the Critical study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures", London 1856, p. 209.
John Mill was permitted to use this manuscript at Oxford, and collated it there in 1671 (as L). Another collation was made by John Jackson and William Tiffin was lent to Wettstein through César de Missy. Wettstein had observed a close affinity between this codex and minuscule 13. It was also examined by Edward Gee. Tregelles re-collated it in 1852 for his edition of the Greek New Testament. Scrivener collated it again in 1855 and published his results, with a full description in the Appendix to his "Codex Augiensis".[tpl]Cite book|last=Scrivener |first= F. H.

K. Abbott along with three other manuscripts of the Ferrar family (marked by L). It was examined and described by Rendel Harris. Gregory saw it in 1883.
Formerly it was held in the library of the Town Council of Leicester. The codex now is located in Leicestershire Record Office (Cod. 6 D 32/1) at Leicester.
