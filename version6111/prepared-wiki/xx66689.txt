As the German-language Duckipedia notes, "His love for historical fashions and costumes predisposed Carpi for Disney parodies of world literature, such as Paperino principe di Dunimarca, a parody of William Shakespeare's Hamlet, or Il mistero dei candelabri, a parody of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables.""Seine Vorliebe für alte Moden und Kostüme prädestinierte Carpi geradezu für Persiflagen und Parodien, von 'Donald, Prinz von Duckenmark' bis 'Das Geheimnis der Silberleuchter', in denen Shakespeares Hamlet und Victor Hugos 'Die Elenden' humorvoll aufbereitet wurden."
