Jenny Warren is an American female singer, best known as the co-founder of the all-female tribute band The Iron Maidens.

==Biography==

Jenny Warren first had an Iron Maiden tribute band called Wrathchild. The idea came when she discovered the website of a Chicago-based tribute band called Revelations. Wrathchild started with Warren (using the stage name "Bruce Chickinson") as the only female member, but when bassist Melanie Sisneros (formerly of Raven Mad and New Eden) joined in 2000,[tpl]cite web|url=http://mel.raven-mad.com/music/index.html |title=Melz Music |publisher=Mel.raven-mad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-27[/tpl] Warren decided to give the band a new direction within the next year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.neonblonde.com/Interview19.htm |title=Interview with Jen "Bruce Chickinson" Warren |publisher=Neonblonde.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-27[/tpl]
On June 2001, Warren and Sisneros were joined by guitarist Sara Marsh (formerly of Bandit), drummer Linda McDonald and guitarist Josephine Draven (both formerly of Phantom Blue) to form The Iron Maidens ("World's Only Female Tribute to Iron Maiden"). The band found some success while touring across the U.S.
In 2003, the Maidens started work on their first album, but production was halted when Warren left the band. The need to raise an autistic child contributed to her departure, which the band did not make official until early 2004.[tpl]cite web|author=March 7, 2004 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=20086 |title=Blabbermouth.net - The Iron Maidens Part Ways with Bruce Chickinson, Vow to Carry On |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=2004-03-07 |accessdate=2013-09-27[/tpl] Later that year, rock/R&B singer/songwriter Aja Kim was announced as Warren's successor by the Maidens.
Shortly after leaving the Maidens, Warren regrouped Wrathchild with Sisneros (who left the Maidens in late 2002) for a one-off performance at MetalJam, a fund-raising event to promote autism awareness and raise funds for charities to find a cure for autism.Blabbermouth.net - MetalJam 2004 to Benefit the Cure Autism Now!
