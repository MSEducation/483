The United States Attorney for the District of Hawaii — also known as the United States Attorney and U.S. Attorney —  is the chief law enforcement officer representing the Federal Government of the United States and principal authority of the United States Department of Justice in the state of Hawaii.  He or she administers the duties of the office from the Prince Kuhio Federal Building in downtown Honolulu near the Aloha Tower and Honolulu Harbor.
The Judiciary Act of 1789 describes the role of the United States Attorney as, "A person learned in the law to act as attorney for the United States whose duty it shall be to prosecute in each district all delinquents for crimes and offenses cognizable under the authority of the United States and all civil actions in which the United States shall be concerned."  The United States Attorney is appointed by the President of the United States and upon confirmation of the United States Senate serves a term of four years.  A member of the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA), he or she has been historically chosen from the same political party that the President professes membership.
The United States Attorney administers a staff consisting of twenty-eight Assistant United States Attorneys.  He also has ordinary jurisdiction over all civilian and military Special Assistant United States Attorneys.
Florence T. Nakakuni was appointed as United States Attorney for the District of Hawaii on September 30, 2009. The previous United States Attorney for the District of Hawaii was Edward H. Kubo, Jr., who was sworn in on December 7, 2001.
