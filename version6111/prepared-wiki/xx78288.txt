The Flag of Nigeria was designed in 1959 and first officially hoisted on October 1, 1960.
The two unique sea-green bands represent the forests and abundant natural wealth of Nigeria while the white band represents peace.

==Design==

The national flag is an adaptation of the winning entry in a competition held in 1959. The original had a red sun with streaming rays placed at the top of the white stripe. This was removed by the judges and the flag has not been altered since. Like other countries, Nigeria has special ensigns for civil and naval vessels. Some of its states also have flags.Nigeria: One Nation, Many Flags 
The designer of the national flag was a student, Michael Taiwo Akinkunmi. 
He hailed from Owu in Abeokuta, Ogun State was a student of Norwich Technical College, England when he saw the advertisement in the national daily that entries were being accepted for the design of a new National Flag. Akinkunmi quickly prepared his entry and sent it to Lagos where it was eventually picked in 1958 as the best and the flag was used to celebrate an independent Nigeria on October 1, 1960; when the Union Flag (Flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) was lowered for the Nigeria Flag to take its place on the flagpole.
Akinkunmi has received numerous awards from both individuals and organisations, and presently lives in Ibadan.
