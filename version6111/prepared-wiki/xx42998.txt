==DVD==

A director's cut was released on DVD with 28 minutes of previously deleted scenes restored. Much of the added time consists of two scenes: one in which Nixon meets with Central Intelligence Agency director Richard Helms (played by Sam Waterston) and another on Tricia Nixon's wedding day, where J. Edgar Hoover persuades Nixon to install the taping system in the Oval Office. The film was re-released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 19, 2008 with the first anamorphic widescreen version of the film in North America.
