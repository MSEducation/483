Creative nonfiction (also known as literary nonfiction or narrative nonfiction) is a genre of writing that uses literary styles and techniques to create factually accurate narratives. Creative nonfiction contrasts with other nonfiction, such as technical writing or journalism, which is also rooted in accurate fact, but is not primarily written in service to its craft. As a genre, creative nonfiction is still relatively young, and is only beginning to be scrutinized with the same critical analysis given to fiction and poetry.

==Characteristics and definition==

For a text to be considered creative nonfiction, it must be factually accurate, and written with attention to literary style and technique. “Ultimately, the primary goal of the creative nonfiction writer is to communicate information, just like a reporter, but to shape it in a way that reads like fiction.”[ref][tpl]cite book |author=Gutkind, Lee |title=The Best Creative Nonfiction, Vol. 1 |publisher=W. W. Norton |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=xi |isbn= 0-393-33003-6[/tpl]

According to Vivian Gornick, "A memoir is a tale taken from life—that is, from actual, not imagined, occurrences—related by a first-person narrator who is undeniably the writer. Beyond these bare requirements it has the same responsibility as the novel or the short story: to shape a piece of experience so that it moves from a tale of private interest to one with meaning for the disinterested reader.” Critic Chris Anderson claims that the genre can be understood best by splitting it into two subcategories—the personal essay and the journalistic essay—but the genre is currently defined by its lack of established conventions.Anderson, page ix.
Literary critic Barbara Lounsberry — in her book The Art of Fact — suggests four constitutive characteristics of the genre, the first of which is “Documentable subject matter chosen from the real world as opposed to ‘invented’ from the writer’s mind.”[tpl]cite book |author=Lounsberry, Barbara |title=The art of fact: contemporary artists of nonfiction |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=1990 |pages=xiii |isbn=0-313-26893-2 |nopp=true[/tpl] By this, she means that the topics and events discussed in the text verifiably exist in the natural world. The second characteristic is “Exhaustive research,”Lounsberry, page xiii which she claims allows writers “novel perspectives on their subjects” and “also permits them to establish the credibility of their narratives through verifiable references in their texts.”Lounsberry, page xiii-xiv The third characteristic that Lounsberry claims is crucial in defining the genre is “The scene”. She stresses the importance of describing and revivifying the context of events in contrast to the typical journalistic style of objective reportage.Lounsberry, page xiv-xv The fourth and final feature she suggests is “Fine writing: a literary prose style”. “Verifiable subject matter and exhaustive research guarantee the nonfiction side of literary nonfiction; the narrative form and structure disclose the writer’s artistry; and finally, its polished language reveals that the goal all along has been literature.”Lounsberry, page xv
Creative nonfiction may be structured like traditional fiction narratives, as is true of Fenton Johnson's story of love and loss, Geography of the Heart,[tpl]cite book|author=Johnson, Fenton|title=Geography of the Heart|publisher=Scribner |date=1 June 1997|isbn=0671009834|isbn=978-0671009830[/tpl] and Virginia Holman's Rescuing Patty Hearst.[tpl]cite book|title=Rescuing Patty Hearst: Memories From a Decade Gone Mad|author=Holman, Virginia|publisher=Simon & Schuster|edition=1st|date=February 25, 2003|isbn=0743222857|isbn=978-0743222853[/tpl] When book-length works of creative nonfiction follow a story-like arc, they are sometimes called narrative nonfiction. Creative nonfiction often escapes traditional boundaries of narrative altogether, as happens in the bittersweet banter of Natalia Ginzburg's essay, "He and I", in John McPhee's hypnotic tour of Atlantic City, In Search of Marvin Gardens, and in Ander Monson's playful, experimental essays in Neck-Deep and Other Predicaments.
Creative nonfiction writers have embraced new ways of forming their texts—including online technologies—because the genre leads itself to grand experimentation. Dozens of new journals have sprung up—both in print and online—that feature creative nonfiction prominently in their offerings

==Ethics==

Writers of creative or narrative non-fiction often discuss the level, and limits, of creative invention in their works, and justify the approaches they have taken to relating true events. Melanie McGrath, whose book Silvertown, an account of her grandmother’s life, is "written in a novelist’s idiom",[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/historybookreviews/3576587/Life-is-sweets.html|title=Life is Sweets|publisher=The Telegraph|date= 28 April 2002 |accessdate=2012-03-04[/tpl] writes in the follow-up, Hopping, that the known facts of her stories are "the canvas on to which I have embroidered. Some of the facts have slipped through the holes – we no longer know them nor have any means of verifying them – and in these cases I have reimagined scenes or reconstructed events in a way I believe reflects the essence of the scene or the event in the minds and hearts of the people who lived through it. ...  To my mind this literary tinkering does not alter the more profound truth of the story."[tpl]cite book|title=Hopping |last=McGrath|first=Melanie|year=2009|publisher= 4th Estate|isbn=978-0-00-722365-7|pages=xiv-xv[/tpl] This concept of fact vs. fiction is elaborated upon in Brenda Miller and Suzanne Paola's book entitled "Tell it Slant." They argue that "...memory itself can be called its own bit of creative nonfiction. We continually—often unconsciously—renovate our memories, shaping them into stories that bring coherence to chaos. Memory has been called the ultimate ‘mythmaker’…” as even one’s firsthand accounts are  unreliable. Duncan Barrett and Nuala Calvi, authors of The Sugar Girls, a novelistic story based on interviews with former sugar-factory workers, make a similar point: "Although we have tried to remain faithful to what our interviewees have told us, at a distance of over half a century many memories are understandably incomplete, and where necessary we have used our own research, and our imaginations, to fill in the gaps. ... However, the essence of the stories related here is true, as they were told to us by those who experienced them at first hand."[tpl]cite book|title=The Sugar Girls|last=Barrett and Calvi|first=Duncan and Nuala|year=2012|publisher= Collins|isbn=978-0-00-744847-0|pages=337–338[/tpl]
In recent years, there have been several well-publicized incidents of memoir writers who exaggerated or fabricated certain facts in their work.[tpl]cite journal |title= Creative Nonfiction, Issue. 38, Spring 2010 |pages= 7–13 |issn= 1070-0714[/tpl]  For example:
Although there have been instances of traditional and literary journalists falsifying their stories, the ethics applied to creative nonfiction are the same as those that apply to journalism. The truth is meant to be upheld, just told in a literary fashion. Essayist John D'Agata explores the issue in his 2012 book Lifespan of a Fact. It examines the relationship between truth and accuracy, and whether it is appropriate for a writer to substitute one for the other. He and fact-checker Jim Fingal undergo an intense debate about the boundaries of creative nonfiction, or "literary nonfiction."

==Literary criticism==

To date, there is very little published literary criticism of creative nonfiction works, despite the fact that the genre is often published in respected publications such as The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Harper's, and Esquire.[tpl]cite book|author=Gutkind, Lee|title=The Art of Creative Nonfiction: Writing and Selling the Literature of Reality|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=New York|year=1997|pages=8|isbn=0-471-11356-5[/tpl] A handful of the most widely recognized writers in the genre such as Gay Talese, Joseph Mitchell, Tom Wolfe, John McPhee, Joan Didion and Norman Mailer, have seen some criticism on their more prominent works. “Critics to date, however, have tended to focus on only one or two of each writer’s works, to illustrate particular critical points.”Lounsberry, page xvi These analyses of a few key pieces are hardly in-depth or as comprehensive as the criticism and analyses of their fictional contemporaries. As the popularity of the genre continues to expand, many nonfiction authors and a handful of literary critics are calling for more extensive literary analysis of the genre.
[tpl]quote|“Nonfiction is no longer the bastard child, the second class citizen; literature is no longer reified, mystified, unavailable. This is the contribution that poststructuralist theory has to make to an understanding of literary nonfiction, since poststructuralist theorists are primarily concerned with how we make meaning and secure authority for claims in meaning of language.”[tpl]cite book |author=Anderson, Chris |title=Literary nonfiction: theory, criticism, pedagogy |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale |year=1989 |pages= xix-x|isbn=0-8093-1405-3 |nopp=true[/tpl][/tpl]
