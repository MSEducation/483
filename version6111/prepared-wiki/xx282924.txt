Borley Church is the parish church in Borley, Essex. Like the former Borley Rectory it is said to be haunted. The church is notable also for its topiary walk and a large monument covering the graves of Sir Edward Waldegrave (a member of Mary I of England's privy council) and his wife.[tpl]cite book|last=Bloxam|first=Matthew Holbeche|title=A Glimpse at the Monumental Architecture and Sculpture of Great Britain: From the Earliest Period to the Eighteenth Century|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I5Y9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA228|year=1834|publisher=Pickering|page=228[/tpl]

==Description and history==

The church (dedication unknown) is a small building of stone; the nave may date to the 11th century. Later renovations have resulted in the mainly perpendicular style of the mid-14th to 16th centuries, still visible in the chancel and the western tower. The church as it now stands consists of chancel, nave, south porch and a crenellated western tower containing bells, with a topiary walk leading to the porch.[tpl]citation |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |title=London |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5DMRn2zNIaEC&pg=PA95 |year=1973 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-071011-3 |page=95[/tpl]  It is designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.[tpl]NHLE|num=1169675 |desc=Parish Church (Dedication unknown)|accessdate=20 August 2013|separator=,|ps=[/tpl]  Grade I is the highest of the three grades of listing, granted to buildings that "are of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important".[tpl]citation |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/| title=Listed buildings |accessdate=20 August 2013 |publisher=English Heritage[/tpl]
Not long after 1545 the manor was granted to Sir Edward Waldegrave (knighted in 1553 at the coronation of Queen Mary, died in the Tower of London on 1 September 1561) by Henry VIII. After the death of Edward, he was admitted to Queen Mary's privy council and granted the manor of Navestock, where he moved the family seat.[tpl]citation |last=Badham |first=Charles |title=The history and antiquities of All saints church, Sudbury, and of the parish generally |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WAgIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA171 |year=1852 |page=171[/tpl] In addition Waldegrave was Master of the Wardrobe for Queen Mary and her husband, Philip II of Spain.[tpl]citation |last=Wright |first=Thomas |title=The history and topography of ...

Both tombs bear a marginal inscription in Latin and a record of other alliances of this family. On the chancel's north wall is a devotional statue of Magdala Southcote, Walgrave's daughter, who died 8 September 1598 (Nikolaus Pevsner notes it, but calls it "not good"). The church contains memorials to two 19th-century rectors, John Philip Herringham and his son William Herringham. John Philip was a Pembroke graduate and one of the signees of a declaration protesting the Maynooth Grant in 1845;[tpl]citation |title=The British Magazine and Monthly Register of Religious and Ecclesiastical Information, Parochial History, and Documents Respecting the State of the Poor, Progress of Education, &c |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FKo2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA57 |year=1845 |publisher=J.

==Claims of haunting==

The church is claimed to be haunted although with much less activity than the former Borley Rectory. Alleged paranormal activity includes "phantom organ music, ghostly chanting, and the ghost of a nun moving about the churchyard".[tpl]citation |last=Buckland |first=Raymond |title=The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y7LKFfO9Bi0C&pg=PA44 |year=2005 |publisher=Visible Ink |isbn=978-1-57859-308-8 |page=44[/tpl] Ghost stories from the church and the rectory are frequently connected to a supposed Benedictine monastery in the area;[tpl]citation |last1=Hawes |first1=Jason |last2=Wilson |first2=Grant |title=Ghost Files: The Collected Cases from Ghost Hunting and Seeking Spirits |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u8SRM_Msd80C&pg=PA398 |year=2011 |publisher=Gallery |isbn=978-1-4516-3310-8|page=398[/tpl] paranormal investigator Ed Warren claims to have accidentally taken a picture of the ghost of a monk, leafing though a book in the church.[tpl]citation |last=Brittle |first=Gerald |title=The Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine Warren |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=niMixISO0j8C&pg=PT23 |year=2013 |publisher=Graymalkin |isbn=978-1-935169-23-9 |pages=23–[/tpl]
