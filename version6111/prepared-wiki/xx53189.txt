The art of haruspicy was taught in the Libri Tagetici, a collection of texts attributed to Tages, a childlike being who figures in Etruscan mythology, and who was discovered in an open field by Tarchon; the Libri Tagetici were translated into Latin and employed in reading omens.
The continuity of the Etruscan tradition among the Romans is indicated by several ancient literary sources, perhaps most famously in the incident related by SuetoniusSuetonius, Divus Julius 81. in which a haruspex named Spurinna warned Julius Caesar to beware the Ides of March.
The emperor Claudius was a student of the Etruscan language and antiquities, and opened a college to preserve and improve their art, which lasted until the reign of Theodosius I, the Christian emperor who dismantled the last active vestiges of the traditional state cult.[tpl]cn|date=March 2013[/tpl] Further evidence has been found of haruspices in Bath, England where the base of a statue dedicated by a haruspex named Memor.[tpl]cn|date=March 2013[/tpl]
