==Music video and background==

The music video features the story of Richie as an art teacher having a seemingly unrequited love for a blind student (Laura Carrington) until he discovers she shares the feeling as demonstrated by the discovery that she is sculpting a likeness of his head.
With the chord progression of Am9—Cmaj7/G—Fmaj7—C6/G—Fmaj7, the song is written in the key of A minor, although the chorus is in D melodic minor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdFPE.asp?ppn=MN0073920&ref=google |title=Unsupported Browser or Operating System |publisher=Musicnotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl]
