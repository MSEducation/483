==Early career==

Born and raised in Murray Harbour, Prince Edward Island. Richards has been friends with Vincent Lecavalier since the age of 14, when they met at Athol Murray College of Notre Dame, a boarding school with an excellent hockey program in Saskatchewan, Canada. They were roommates and soon became good friends as they were both the youngest players on their hockey team. Since then they have gone on to being teammates for the Rimouski Océanic of the QMJHL and Tampa Bay Lightning. Lecavalier was also responsible for suggesting to the Lightning management after they had drafted him to draft Richards.
In his final season with Rimouski, Richards won nearly every honor possible for a Canadian junior player in the QMJHL: he earned the Jean Béliveau Trophy after leading the league with 186 points, as well as the Telus Cup, given to the league's best offensive player; he won the QMJHL and Canadian Hockey League Plus/Minus Awards with a plus-80 mark, and was a First-Team All-Star in both the Quebec circuit and the CHL, as well as the CHL Player of the Year and Leading Scorer. In the postseason, Richards took home both the Guy Lafleur Trophy as MVP of the 'Q' league playoffs, then the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as MVP of the 2000 Memorial Cup, as the Océanic won both the QMJHL playoff title and the CHL national championship.

==Playing career==

===Tampa Bay Lightning===

Richards was drafted in the 3rd round, 64th overall, by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, despite recording 82 assists and 115 points in his draft year. During that same draft, the Lightning selected Vincent Lecavalier, Richards' teammate at the both Athol Murray College of Notre Dame and Rimouski, with the first overall pick. Richards went on to win the Conn Smythe and the Lady Byng Trophies in 2004. He also won the Stanley Cup with the Lightning in 2004. Later that same year, he won the World Cup of Hockey Championship playing on Team Canada. Richards holds the record for game-winning goals in a single playoff season with seven in 2004, overtaking Joe Sakic's and Joe Nieuwendyk's record of six.
On September 26, 2004 the Rimouski Océanic of the QMJHL retired Richards jersey. Richards played for Rimouski Océanic from 1997-2000.[tpl]cite web|title=Retired Jerseys|url=http://www.oceanic.qc.ca/page/chandails_retires|publisher=Rimouski Océanic|accessdate=12 March 2012[/tpl]

===Dallas Stars===

On February 26, 2008, roughly 3 hours before the NHL trade deadline, Richards was traded to the Dallas Stars in a blockbuster deal along with goaltender Johan Holmqvist for goalie Mike Smith, centre Jeff Halpern, winger Jussi Jokinen and a 2009 4th round draft pick.  Richards had the Stars franchise record of most assists in a player's first game with five. The record is also a career high for Richards. The Stars defeated the Blackhawks 7–4, and Richards was named the number one star of the game.
In the 2008 Playoffs, Richards tied an NHL record by scoring four points in a single period in game 2 against the San Jose Sharks.
During the 2008–09 season, Richards tallied 16 goals and 48 points in 55 games before sustaining a broken right wrist following a check from Columbus Blue Jackets forward Jakub Voráček on February 16, 2009. Richards met with a specialist the following day and missed 15 games.[tpl]cite web | title = Stars' Richards out indefinitely with a broken wrist|publisher=TSN|url = http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/teams/story/?id=267436&hubname=nhl-stars&lid=sublink02&lpos=headlines_nhl-stars|date = February 16, 2009[/tpl]
Richards returned to the Dallas Stars lineup March 21, but the former playoff MVP then broke his other hand in the third period of Dallas' loss to San Jose Sharks. He would not return for the rest of the 2009 season, and the Stars missed the playoffs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=4004286 |title=Dallas Stars' Brad Richards hurt in return – ESPN |publisher=ESPN |date=March 22, 2009 |accessdate=February 12, 2012[/tpl]
In the 2009–10 offseason, the team removed GMs Brett Hull and Les Jackson who had traded for Richards, and fired coach Dave Tippett who was replaced by Marc Crawford.  Despite the new regime and the team's woeful finish in the standings for the second straight season, Richards enjoyed a career year matching a personal high with 91 points playing mainly alongside Loui Eriksson and roommate James Neal.  Richards finished 7th in the NHL points standings that year, just behind former teammate Martin St. Louis.  He also finished fourth in total assists, and second in powerplay production in the league.  The Stars however would fail to reach the playoffs again.  After the season, Richards was named a finalist for the Lady Byng Trophy.[tpl]cite web|last=Durrett |first=Richard |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/dallasstars/post/_/id/1726/stars-richards-among-lady-byng-finalists |title=Stars' Richards among Lady Byng finalists – Dallas Stars Blog – ESPN Dallas |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=February 12, 2012[/tpl]
