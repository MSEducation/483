It is purported that walking the third floor corridors is the ghost of a young girl named Emily, or Amelia. [tpl]citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl] It is believed she was locked in the tower by her father and died in a fire that originated from a burning candle. There is evidence of a fire, but no evidence that it was in that location, or that anybody died in it.
