[[Immunomagnetic separation]]

CATEGORIES: Laboratory techniques, Molecular biology

Immunomagnetic separation (IMS) is a laboratory tool that can efficiently isolate cells out of body fluid or cultured cells. It can also be used as a method of quantifying the pathogenicity of food, blood or feces. DNA analysis have supported the combined use of both this technique and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).Engstrand, L. and Enroth, H., Journal of Clinical microbiology, vol.33, no.8, August 1995, p.Â 2162-2165. Another laboratory separation tool is the affinity magnetic separation (AMS), which is more suitable for the isolation of prokaryotic cells.Affinity magnetic separation of Listeria spp and Escherichia coli O157 (Bacteria Capture Kit)

==Technique==

Antibodies coating paramagnetic beads will bind to antigens present on the surface of cells thus capturing the cells and facilitate the concentration of these bead-attached cells. The concentration process is created by a magnet placed on the side of the test tube bringing the beads to it.
