The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States in which its fifteen member universities compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)'s Division I, with its football teams competing in the  Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest levels for athletic competition in US-based collegiate sports. The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation.  The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an "access bowl", the successors to the BCS.
Founded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.[tpl]cite web|title=ACC Extends Formal Invitation for Membership to the University of Louisville|url=http://www.theacc.com/genrel/112812aaa.html|publisher=Atlantic Coast Conference|date=Nov 28, 2012|accessdate=Nov 28, 2012[/tpl]
ACC member universities represent a range of well-regarded private and public universities of various enrollment sizes, all of which participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference Inter-institutional Academic Consortium (ACCIAC) whose purpose is to "enrich the educational missions, especially the undergraduate student experiences, of member universities".

==History==

Seven universities in the South Atlantic States were charter members of the ACC: Clemson, Duke, Maryland, North Carolina, North Carolina State, South Carolina, and Wake Forest. Previously members of the Southern Conference, they left partially due to that league's ban on post-season play. After drafting a set of bylaws for the creation of a new league, the seven withdrew from the Southern Conference at the spring meeting on the morning of May 8, 1953. The bylaws were ratified on June 14, 1953, and the ACC was created, becoming the second conference formed by schools collectively withdrawing from the SoCon, after the Southeastern Conference. On December 4, 1953, officials convened in Greensboro, North Carolina, and admitted Virginia, a SoCon charter member that had been independent since 1937, into the conference.[tpl]cite web|title=About the ACC|url=http://www.theacc.com/this-is/acc-this-is.html|publisher=Atlantic Coast Conference|accessdate=February 3, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65Bl9Updo|archivedate=February 3, 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]
In 1960, the ACC implemented a minimum SAT score for incoming student-athletes of 750, the first conference to do so.  This minimum was raised to 800 in 1964, but was ultimately struck down by a federal court in 1972.[tpl]cite web|title=ACC Basketball|url=http://uncpress.unc.edu/browse/author_interview?title_id=2207|publisher=UNC Press|accessdate=February 17, 2014[/tpl]
In 1971, South Carolina left the ACC to become an independent. The ACC operated with seven members until the addition of Georgia Tech from the Metro Conference on April 3, 1978. The total number of member schools reached nine with the addition of Florida State, also formerly from the Metro Conference, on July 1, 1991. The additions of those schools marked the first expansions of the conference footprint since 1953, though both schools were still located with the rest of the ACC schools in the South Atlantic States.
The ACC added three members from the Big East Conference during the 2005 cycle of conference realignment: Miami and Virginia Tech joined on July 1, 2004, and Boston College joined on July 1, 2005, as the league's twelfth member and the first from New England or anywhere in the Northeastern US. The expansion was not without controversy, since Connecticut, Rutgers, Pittsburgh, and West Virginia (and, initially, Virginia Tech) filed lawsuits against the ACC, Miami, and Boston College for conspiring to weaken the Big East Conference.

On September 12, 2012, Notre Dame agreed to join the ACC in all sports except football and hockey as the conference's first-ever member in the Midwestern United States.

The ACC's presidents announced on April 22, 2013, that all 15 schools that will be members of the conference in 2014–15 had signed a grant of media rights, effective immediately and running through the 2026–27 school year, coinciding with the duration of the conference's current TV deal with ESPN. This move essentially prevents the ACC from being a target for other conferences seeking to expand—under the grant, if a school leaves the conference during the contract period, all revenue derived from that school's media rights for home games would belong to the ACC and not the school.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9200081/acc-media-rights-deal-lock-schools-okd-presidents |title=Media deal OK'd to solidify ACC |first=Brett |last=McMurphy |publisher=ESPN.com |date=April 24, 2013 |accessdate=April 24, 2013[/tpl] The move also leaves the SEC as the only one of the so-called "Power Five" FBS conferences without a grant of rights.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/acc/post/_/id/54697/you-want-stability-look-at-the-acc |title=You want stability?

==Member schools==

===Current members===

The ACC has fifteen members.  On July 1, 2014, Maryland will depart for the Big Ten Conference and Louisville will join from the American Athletic Conference.  For two of the 25 ACC-administered sports, baseball and football, schools are assigned to one of two seven-team divisions named the Atlantic Division and the Coastal Division.  One member, Notre Dame, plays baseball in the Atlantic Division but does not compete in ACC football, instead competing as a football independent while playing a rotating selection of five ACC football teams per season.  Syracuse does not field a varsity baseball team, but competes in the Atlantic Division for football.

===Future member===

Louisville will join the ACC as a full member on July 1, 2014.
