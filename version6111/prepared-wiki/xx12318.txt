[[Wart]]

CATEGORIES: Papillomavirus-associated diseases, Virus-related cutaneous conditions, Cutaneous conditions

A wart is a small, rough growth resembling a cauliflower or a solid blister. It typically occurs on humans' hands or feet but often in other locations. Warts are caused by a viral infection, specifically by one of the many types of human papillomavirus (HPV). There are as many as 10 varieties of warts, the most common considered to be mostly harmless. It is possible to get warts from others; they are contagious and usually enter the body in an area of broken skin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/tc/warts-and-plantar-warts-topic-overview |title=Warts Types, Causes, Symptoms, Treatments, Prevention |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2013-05-17[/tpl] They typically disappear after a few months but can last for years and can reoccur.Warts.

==Types==

A range of types of wart have been identified, varying in shape and site affected, as well as the type of human papillomavirus involved.[tpl]cite book|author1=Anderson, Keith, |author2=Keith, Jeff|author3=Novak, Patricia D.|coauthors=Elliot, Michelle A.|title=Mosby's Medical, Nursing, and Allied Health Dictionary|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5RXAAQAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=C.V.

==Cause==

Warts are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). There are about 130 known types of human papilloma viruses.[tpl]cite journal | author = de Villiers EM, Fauquet C, Broker TR, Bernard HU, zur Hausen H | title = Classification of papillomaviruses | journal = Virology | volume = 324 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–27 | date = Jun 2004 | pmid = 15183049 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2004.03.033 [/tpl] HPV infects the squamous epithelium, usually of the skin or genitals, but each HPV type is typically only able to infect a few specific areas on the body. Many HPV types can produce a benign growth, often called a "wart" or "papilloma", in the area they infect. Many of the more common HPV and wart types are listed below.

==Pathophysiology==

Common warts have a characteristic appearance under the microscope.  They have thickening of the stratum corneum (hyperkeratosis), thickening of the stratum spinosum (acanthosis), thickening of the stratum granulosum, rete ridge elongation, and large blood vessels at the dermoepidermal junction.

==Prevention==

Gardasil is an HPV vaccine aimed at preventing cervical cancers and genital warts.  Gardasil is designed to prevent infection with HPV types 16, 18, 6, and 11. HPV types 16 and 18 currently cause about 70% of cervical cancer cases, and also cause some vulvar, vaginal, penile and anal cancers. HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for 90% of documented cases of genital warts.[tpl]cite web |title=Perspective – The Potential of Human Papillomavirus Vaccines |first= Robert |last=Steinbrook |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/11/1109 |date= March 16, 2006[/tpl] Unfortunately the HPV vaccines do not currently prevent the virus strain responsible for verrucas (plantar warts).

==Treatment==

There are many treatments and procedures associated with wart removal. A review of clinical trials of various cutaneous wart treatments concluded that topical treatments containing salicylic acid were more effective than placebo.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kwok CS, Gibbs S, Bennett C, Holland R, Abbott R | title = Topical treatments for cutaneous warts | journal = The Cochrane database of systematic reviews | volume = 9 | pages = CD001781 | date = Sep 12, 2012 | pmid = 22972052 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001781.pub3 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0011182/ | editor1-last = Gibbs | editor1-first = Sam [/tpl] Cryotherapy appears to be as effective as salicylic acid, but there have been fewer trials.
One complicating factor in the treatment of warts is that the wart may regrow after it has been removed.

===Medication===

Another product available over-the-counter that can aid in wart removal is silver nitrate in the form of a caustic pencil, which is also available at drug stores. In a placebo-controlled study of 70 patients, silver nitrate given over nine days resulted in clearance of all warts in 43% and improvement in warts in 26% one month after treatment compared to 11% and 14%, respectively, in the placebo group.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sterling JC, Handfield-Jones S, Hudson PM | title = Guidelines for the management of cutaneous warts | journal = British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 144 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–11 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11167676 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2001.04066.x | url = http://www.huidziekten.nl/richtlijnen/BADguidelineCutaneousWarts2001.pdf | author4 = British Association of Dermatologists [/tpl] The instructions must be followed to minimize staining of skin and clothing. Occasionally pigmented scars may develop.
Cryosurgery or cryotherapy devices using a dimethyl ether – propane mixture are inexpensive.  A disadvantage is that the sponge applicator is too large for small warts, and the temperature achieved is not nearly as low as with liquid nitrogen.  Complications include blistering of normal skin if excess freezing is not controlled.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
Several randomized, controlled trials have found that zinc sulfate, consumed orally, often reduces or eliminates warts.[tpl]cite journal | author = Stefani M, Bottino G, Fontenelle E, Azulay DR | title = Efficacy comparison between cimetidine and zinc sulphate in the treatment of multiple and recalcitrant warts | journal = An Bras Dermatol | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19377755 | doi =  | url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0365-05962009000100003&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Yaghoobi R, Sadighha A, Baktash D | title = Evaluation of oral zinc sulfate effect on recalcitrant multiple viral warts: a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial | journal = J.

For elemental zinc, a lower dosage of 2.5 mg/kg/day may be appropriate as large amounts of zinc may cause a copper deficiency. Other trials have found that topical zinc sulfate solution[tpl]cite journal | author = Sharquie KE, Khorsheed AA, Al-Nuaimy AA | title = Topical zinc sulphate solution for treatment of viral warts | journal = Saudi Med J | volume = 28 | issue = 9 | pages = 1418–21 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17768472 | doi =  | url =  [/tpl] or zinc oxide[tpl]cite journal | author = Khattar JA, Musharrafieh UM, Tamim H, Hamadeh GN | title = Topical zinc oxide vs. salicylic acid-lactic acid combination in the treatment of warts | journal = Int.

==Folk remedies==

A variety of traditional folk remedies and rituals claim to be able to remove warts.
The acrid yellow sap of Greater Celandine is used as a traditional wart remedy.http://www.botanical-online.com/english/celandine_for_warts.htm The sap can be applied directly to the wart in a similar manner to concentrated salicylic acid solution, but in more modest quantities.
In The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain has his characters discuss a variety of such remedies.  Tom Sawyer proposes "spunk-water" (or "stump-water", the water collecting in the hollow of a tree stump) as a remedy for warts on the hand.  You put your hand into the water at midnight and say:
and then "walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak the charm's busted."  This is held to be superior to Huckleberry Finn's preferred remedy which involved throwing a dead cat into a graveyard.  Another remedy involved splitting a bean, drawing blood from the wart and putting it on one of the halves, and burying that half at a crossroads at midnight.  The theory of operation is that the blood on the buried bean will draw away the wart.Mark Twain, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, ch. 6 Twain is recognized as an early collector and recorder of genuine American folklore.LeMaster, J. R. (1993) The Mark Twain Encyclopedia (Taylor and Francis, pp. 293–294, ISBN 0-8240-7212-X.
Similar practices are recorded elsewhere.  In Louisiana, one remedy for warts involves rubbing the wart with a potato, which is then buried; when the "buried potato dries up, the wart will be cured".[tpl]cite journal|author=Webb, Julie Yvonne |title=Louisiana Voodoo and Superstitions Relating to Health|journal=HSMHA Health Reports|year=1971|volume=86|issue=4|pmc=1937133|pages=291, 296–297|doi=10.2307/4594154[/tpl]  Another remedy similar to Twain's is reported from Northern Ireland, where water from a specific well on Rathlin Island is credited with the power to cure warts.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ballard LM | title = An approach to traditional cures in Ulster | journal = The Ulster medical journal | volume = 78 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–33 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19252727 | pmc = 2629017 [/tpl]
A longstanding tradition holds that touching toads will cause warts.  The most common Northern Hemisphere toads have glands that protrude from their skin that superficially resemble warts.  Warts are caused by a virus, and toads do not harbor it.[tpl]cite web | url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/life/zoology/reptiles-amphibians/toads-cause-warts.htm | title=Do toads cause warts? | publisher=science.howstuffworks.com | accessdate=October 20, 2012 | author=Clark, Josh | page=2[/tpl]
