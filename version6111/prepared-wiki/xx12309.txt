The distribution of vegetation in northern West Bengal is dictated by elevation and precipitation. For example, the foothills of the Himalayas, the Dooars, are densely wooded with Sal and other tropical evergreen trees. However, above an elevation of [tpl]convert|1000|m|ft[/tpl], the forest becomes predominantly subtropical. In Darjeeling, which is above [tpl]convert|1500|m|ft[/tpl], temperate-forest trees such as oaks, conifers, and rhododendrons predominate.
West Bengal has 3.26% of its geographical area under protected areas comprising 15 wildlife sanctuaries and 5 national parks — Sundarbans National Park, Buxa Tiger Reserve, Gorumara National Park, Neora Valley National Park and Singalila National Park. Extant wildlife include Indian rhinoceros, Indian elephant, deer, leopard, gaur, tiger, and crocodiles, as well as many bird species. Migratory birds come to the state during the winter. The high-altitude forests of Singalila National Park shelter barking deer, red panda, chinkara, takin, serow, pangolin, minivet and Kalij pheasants. The Sundarbans are noted for a reserve project conserving the endangered Bengal tiger, although the forest hosts many other endangered species, such as the Gangetic dolphin, river terrapin and estuarine crocodile.[tpl]harvnb|West Bengal Human Development Report|2004|loc=Ch. 10: Problems of Specific Regions|pp=200–203[/tpl] The mangrove forest also acts as a natural fish nursery, supporting coastal fishes along the Bay of Bengal. Recognizing its special conservation value, Sundarban area has been declared as a Biosphere Reserve.

==Government and politics==

West Bengal is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. There are two branches of government. The legislature, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, that are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The judiciary is composed of the Calcutta High Court and a system of lower courts. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister, although the titular head of government is the Governor. The Governor is the head of state appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 295 Members of the Legislative Assembly, or MLAs, including one nominated from the Anglo-Indian community. Terms of office run for 5 years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The state contributes 42 seats to Lok Sabha[tpl]cite web |url= http://ceowestbengal.nic.in/news_pdf/gazette123.pdf|format=PDF|title=Notification: order no. 18 |author=Delimitation Commission |date= 15 February 2006|publisher=Election Commission of India |location=New Delhi |pages=23–25  |accessdate=11 February 2012[/tpl] and 16 seats to Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament.[tpl]cite web |url= http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rsat_work/chapter-2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Composition of Rajya Sabha |work=Rajya Sabha at work |publisher=Rajya Sabha Secretariat |location=New Delhi |pages=24–25  |accessdate=15 February 2012[/tpl]
The main players in the regional politics are the All India Trinamool Congress, the Indian National Congress, the Left Front alliance (led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M)). Following the West Bengal State Assembly Election in 2011, the All India Trinamool Congress and Indian National Congress coalition under Mamata Banerjee of the All India Trinamool Congress was elected to power (getting 225 seats in the legislature).[tpl]cite web|title=Statewise results – West Bengal|url=http://eciresults.nic.in/statewiseS25.htm|publisher=Election Commission of India|accessdate=13 May 2011[/tpl] West Bengal was ruled by the Left Front for the 34 years (1977–2011), making it the world's longest-running democratically elected communist government.

==Subdivisions==

The following is a list of nineteen districts of by rank in India.[tpl]cite web|title=Indian Districts by Population, Growth Rate, Sex Ratio 2011 Census|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=3 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.webel-india.com/blocks%20n%20grampanchayats.doc |title=Directory of district, sub division, panchayat samiti/ block and gram panchayats in West Bengal, March 2008 |date=March 2008|publisher=West Bengal Electronics Industry Development Corporation Limited, Government of West Bengal |page=1 |format=DOC |accessdate=15 February 2012[/tpl]

Each district is governed by a district collector or district magistrate, appointed either by the Indian Administrative Service or the West Bengal Civil Service. Each district is subdivided into Sub-Divisions, governed by a sub-divisional magistrate, and again into Blocks. Blocks consists of panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities.
The capital and largest city of the state is Kolkata – the third-largest urban agglomeration[ref]

Other major cities and towns in West Bengal are Howrah, Durgapur, Raniganj, Haldia, Jalpaiguri, Kharagpur, Burdwan, Darjeeling, Midnapore, and Malda.

==Economy==

In 2009–10, the tertiary sector of the economy (service industries) was the largest contributor to the gross domestic product of the state, contributing 57.8% of the state domestic product compared to 24% from primary sector (agriculture, forestry, mining) and 18.2% from secondary sector (industrial and manufacturing).[tpl]rp|12[/tpl] Agriculture is the leading occupation in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane and wheat are the top five crops of the state.[tpl]rp|14[/tpl] Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high quality teas.[tpl]rp|14[/tpl] State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and Haldia port region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wbidc.com/about_wb/industrial_infrastructure.htm|title= Industrial infrastructure|publisher=West bengal Industrial Development Corporation|accessdate=5 March 2012[/tpl] The Durgapur–Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of major steel plants. Manufacturing industries playing an important economic role are engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches, and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals and fertilisers. Natural resources like tea and jute in and nearby parts has made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.
A significant part of the state is economically backward, namely, large parts of six northern districts of Cooch Behar, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Malda, North Dinajpur and South Dinajpur; three western districts of Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum; and the Sundarbans area.[tpl]harvnb|West Bengal Human Development Report|2004|loc=Ch. 1: Introduction and Human Development Indices for West Bengal|pp=4–6[/tpl] Years after independence, West Bengal was still dependent on the central government for meeting its demands for food; food production remained stagnant and the Indian green revolution bypassed the state. However, there has been a significant spurt in food production since the 1980s, and the state now has a surplus of grains. The state's share of total industrial output in India was 9.8% in 1980–81, declining to 5% by 1997–98. However, the service sector has grown at a rate higher than the national rate.
In terms net state domestic product (NSDP), West Bengal has the sixth largest economy (2009–2010) in India, with an NSDP of 3663 billion Indian rupees, behind Maharashtra (8179 billion), Uttar Pradesh (4530 billion), Andhra Pradesh (4268 billion), Tamil Nadu (4177 billion), and Gujarat (3704 billion). In the period 2004–2005 to 2009–2010, the average gross state domestic product (GSDP) growth rate was 13.9% (calculated in Indian rupee term), lower than 15.5%, the average for all states of the country.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ibef.org/download/West_Bengal_271211.pdf|title= West Bengal|date=November 2011 |publisher=India Brand Equity Foundation |accessdate=6 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]rp|4[/tpl] The state’s per capita GSDP at current prices in 2009–10 was US$956.4, improved from US$553.7 in 2004–05,[tpl]rp|10[/tpl]but lower than the national per capita GSDP of US$1,302.[tpl]rp|4[/tpl] The state's total financial debt stood at [tpl]INRConvert|1918350|m[/tpl] as of 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-10-22/news/30309832_1_debt-restructuring-plan-debt-burden-12th-plan|title=Mamata seeks debt restructuring plan for West Bengal|newspaper=Economic Times|location=New Delhi|date=22 October 2011|accessdate=4 March 2012[/tpl]
The state has promoted foreign direct investment, which has mostly come in the software and electronics fields; Kolkata is becoming a major hub for the Information technology (IT) industry. Rapid industrialisation process has given rise to debate over land acquisition for industry in this agrarian state. NASSCOM–Gartner ranks West Bengal power infrastructure the best in the country. Notably, many corporate companies are now headquartered in Kolkata include ITC Limited, India Government Mint, Kolkata, Haldia Petrochemicals, Exide Industries, Hindustan Motors, Britannia Industries, Bata India, Birla Corporation, CESC Limited, Coal India Limited, Damodar Valley Corporation, PwC India, Peerless Group, United Bank of India, UCO Bank and Allahabad Bank. In 2010s, events such as adoption of "Look East" policy by the government of India, opening of the Nathu La Pass in Sikkim as a border trade-route with China and immense interest in the South East Asian countries to enter the Indian market and invest have put Kolkata in an advantageous position for development in future, particularly with likes of Myanmar, where India needs oil from military regime.
