Latvia [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Latvia.ogg|ˈ|l|æ|t|v|i|ə[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-lv|Latvija[/tpl]) officially the Republic of Latvia ([tpl]lang-lv|Latvijas Republika[/tpl]), is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe. It is bordered by Estonia, Lithuania, Russia, Belarus and by a maritime border to the west with Sweden. Latvia has 2,003,000 inhabitants[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/statistikas-temas/population-census-2011-key-indicators-33613.html|title=Population Census 2011 – Key Indicators|date=2 April 2012|publisher=Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia|accessdate=2 June 2012[/tpl] and a territory of [tpl]convert|64589|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.li.lv/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=1060|title=Latvia in Brief|year=2011|publisher=Latvian Institute|accessdate=5 November 2011[/tpl] The country has a temperate seasonal climate.
Latvia is a democratic parliamentary republic established in 1918. The capital city is Riga, the European Capital of Culture 2014. Latvian is the official language.  Latvia is a unitary state, divided into 118 administrative divisions of which 109 are municipalities and 9 are cities. There are five planning regions: Kurzeme, Latgale, Riga, Vidzeme and Zemgale.
The Latvians are Baltic people, culturally related to the Lithuanians. Latvians and Livs are the indigenous people of Latvia. Latvian is an Indo-European language; it and Lithuanian are the only two surviving Baltic languages. Despite foreign rule from the 13th to 20th centuries, the Latvian nation maintained its identity throughout the generations via the language and musical traditions. Latvia and Estonia share a long common history. As a consequence of the Soviet occupation both countries are home to a large number of ethnic Russians (26.9% in Latvia[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.lv/lv/latvia/integracija/integracijas-politika/kultura/ |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110712232935/http://www.mfa.gov.lv/lv/latvia/integracija/integracijas-politika/kultura/ |archivedate=2011-07-12 |title=Etniskais sastāvs un mazākumtautību kultūras identitātes veicināšana |publisher=Latvijas Republikas Ārlietu Ministrija |accessdate=2 December 2011[/tpl] and 25.5% in Estonia[tpl]cite web|url=http://estonia.eu/about-estonia/country/estonia-at-a-glance.html|title=Estonia at a glance|year=2011|publisher=Estonia.eu|accessdate=5 November 2011[/tpl]) of whom some are non-citizens. Latvia is historically predominantly Protestant Lutheran, except for the Latgale region in the southeast, which has historically been predominantly Roman Catholic.
The Republic of Latvia was founded on 18 November 1918. However, its de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II. In 1940, the country was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union, invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941, and re-occupied by the Soviets in 1944 to form the Latvian SSR for the next fifty years. The peaceful Singing Revolution, starting in 1987, called for Baltic emancipation of Soviet rule. It ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, and Latvia declared the restoration of its de facto independence on 21 August 1991.
Latvia is a member of NATO, European Union, United Nations, Council of Europe, CBSS, IMF, NB8, NIB, OSCE, WTO and OECD. For 2013, Latvia is listed 44th on the Human Development Index and as a high income country.[tpl]cite web|title=Latvia – Country Profile: Human Development Indicators|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/LVA.html|work=http://hdrstats.undp.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Latvia|url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/latvia|work=http://data.worldbank.org|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=15 July 2013[/tpl] It used the Latvian lats as its currency until this was replaced by the euro on 1 January 2014.[tpl]cite web|title=EU and euro|url=http://www.bank.lv/en/eu-and-euro/eu-and-euro|publisher=Bank of Latvia|accessdate=16 July 2013[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The name Latvija is derived from the name of the ancient Latgalians, one of four Indo-European Baltic tribes (along with Couronians, Selonians and Semigallians), which formed the ethnic core of modern Latvians together with the Finnic Livonians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://latinst.lv/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Latvia_in_brief.pdf|title=Latvia in Brief|year=2012|publisher=Latvian Institute|accessdate=12 May 2011[/tpl]

==History==

Around 3000 BCE, the proto-Baltic ancestors of the Latvian people settled on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea.[tpl]cite web |url=http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/msr/Ethno/dategen1.html|title=Data: 3000 BC to 1500 BC |publisher=The Ethnohistory Project|work=The European Ethnohistory Database|accessdate=2006-08-06[/tpl] The Balts established trade routes to Rome and Byzantium, trading local amber for precious metals.A History of Rome, M Cary and HH Scullard, p455-457, Macmillan Press, ISBN 0-333-27830-5 By 900 CE, four distinct Baltic tribes inhabited Latvia: Curonians, Latgalians, Selonians, Semigallians (in Latvian: kurši, latgaļi, sēļi and zemgaļi), as well as the Livonians (lībieši) speaking a Finnic language.

===The Medieval period===

Although the local people had contact with the outside world for centuries, they were more fully integrated into European society in the 12th century.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsEurope/EasternLatvia.htm|title=Data: Latvia|publisher=The History Files|work=Kingdoms of Northern Europe – Latvia[/tpl] The first missionaries, sent by the Pope, sailed up the Daugava River in the late 12th century, seeking converts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/latvia/history |title=Latvian History, Lonely Planet |publisher=Lonelyplanet.com |accessdate=2010-10-16[/tpl] The local people, however, did not convert to Christianity as readily as hoped. German crusaders were sent into Latvia to convert the population from their original pagan beliefs by force of arms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.balticsworldwide.com/the-crusaders/|title=The Crusaders|publisher=City Paper|accessdate=2007-07-28|date=2006-03-22[/tpl]
In the beginning of the 13th century, large parts of today's Latvia were ruled by Germans. Together with Southern Estonia, these conquered areas formed the crusader state that became known as Terra Mariana or Livonia. In 1282, Riga, and later the cities of Cēsis, Limbaži, Koknese and Valmiera, were included in the Hanseatic League. Riga became an important point of east-west trading and formed close cultural contacts with Western Europe.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]

===The Reformation period===

The 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries were a time of great change for the inhabitants of Latvia, including the reformation, the collapse of the Livonian state, and the time when the Latvian territory was divided up among foreign powers.
After the Livonian War (1558–1583), Livonia (Latvia) fell under Polish and Lithuanian rule. The southern part of Estonia and the northern part of Latvia were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and formed into the Ducatus Ultradunensis (Pārdaugavas hercogiste). Gotthard Kettler, the last Master of the Order of Livonia, formed the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] Though the duchy was a vassal state to Poland, it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 17th century. Latgalia, the easternmost region of Latvia, became a part of the Polish district of Inflanty.
The 17th and early 18th centuries saw a struggle between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Sweden, and Russia for supremacy in the eastern Baltic. After the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611), northern Livonia (including Vidzeme) came under Swedish rule. Riga became the capital of Swedish Livonia and the largest city in the entire Swedish Empire.Kasekamp, p. 47 Fighting continued sporadically between Sweden and Poland until the Truce of Altmark in 1629.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] In Latvia, the Swedish period is generally remembered as positive; serfdom was eased, a network of schools was established for the peasantry, and the power of the regional barons was diminished.[ref]H. Strods, "'Dobrye Shvedskie Vremena' v Istoriografii Latvii (Konets XVIII V. – 70-E Gg.

Several important cultural changes occurred during this time. Under Swedish and largely German rule, western Latvia adopted Lutheranism as its main religion. The ancient tribes of the Couronians, Semigallians, Selonians, Livs and northern Latgallians assimilated to form the Latvian people, speaking one Latvian language. Throughout all the centuries, however, no such thing as a Latvian state existed so the borders and definitions of who exactly fell within that group are largely subjective. Meanwhile, largely isolated from the rest of Latvia, southern Latgallians adopted Catholicism under Polish/Jesuit influence. The native dialect remained distinct, although it acquired many Polish and Russian loanwords.[tpl]cite journal|author= V.

===Latvia in the Russian Empire (1710–1917)===

The Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia in 1710 and the Treaty of Nystad, ending the Great Northern War in 1721, gave Vidzeme to Russia (it became part of the Riga Governorate).[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] The Latgale region remained part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as Inflanty Voivodeship until 1772, when it was incorporated into Russia. The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia became an autonomous Russian province (the Courland Governorate) in 1795, bringing all of what is now Latvia into the Russian Empire. All three Baltic provinces preserved local laws, German as the local official language and their own parliament, the Landtag.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
During the Great Northern War (1700–1721), up to 40 per cent of Latvians died from famine and plague."The history of the Baltic States". Kevin O'Connor (2004). p.29. ISBN 0-313-32355-0 Half the residents of Riga were killed by plague in 1710–1711.[tpl]Wayback |date=20100719083420 |url=http://www.bank.lv/eng/main/am/jubmon/nmp/index.php?32661 |title=Collector Coin Dedicated to 18th Century Riga [/tpl]. Bank of Latvia.
The promises Peter the Great made to the Baltic German nobility at the fall of Riga in 1710, confirmed by the Treaty of Nystad and known as "the Capitulations", largely reversed the Swedish reforms.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] Peter seriously considered moving Russian capital[tpl]Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=money or Moscow?[/tpl] into Riga and visited Riga for several long stays (he stayed in his own palace offered as a gift by Riga Magistrate together with keys from Riga; palace purchased by him is still standing; keys are exhibited in Moscow Kremlin museum).
Curiously, Peter the Great's wife Marta (later Catherine I of Russia) was the only Latvian person ever to become royalty.
The emancipation of the serfs took place in Courland in 1817 and in Vidzeme in 1819.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] In practice, however, the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation, forcing them to return to work at the estates "of their own free will".
During the 19th century, the social structure changed dramatically.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land, but many landless peasants remained.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] There also developed a growing urban proletariat and an increasingly influential Latvian bourgeoisie. The Young Latvian ([tpl]lang-lv|Jaunlatvieši[/tpl]) movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century, many of its leaders looking to the Slavophiles for support against the prevailing German-dominated social order.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] The rise in use of the Latvian language in literature and society became known as the First National Awakening. Russification began in Latgale after the Polish led the January Uprising in 1863: this spread to the rest of what is now Latvia by the 1880s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] The Young Latvians were largely eclipsed by the New Current, a broad leftist social and political movement, in the 1890s. Popular discontent exploded in the 1905 Russian Revolution, which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces.
During these two centuries Latvia experienced economic and construction boom – ports were expanded (Riga became the largest port in the Russian Empire), railways built; new factories, banks and University were established; many residential, public (theatres and museums) and school buildings erected; new parks formed; etc. Riga's boulevards and streets with beautiful buildings outside the Old Town date from this period.

===Declaration of Independence===

World War I devastated the territory of what would become the state of Latvia, including other western parts of the Russian Empire. Demands for self-determination were at first confined to autonomy, but the Russian 1917 Revolution, treaty with Germany at Brest-Litovsk, and allied armistice with Germany on November 11, 1918, created a power vacuum. The People's Council of Latvia proclaimed the independence of the new country in Riga on 18 November 1918, with Kārlis Ulmanis becoming the head of the provisional government.
The War of Independence that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in Eastern Europe. By the spring of 1919, there were actually three governments—Ulmanis's government; the Latvian Soviet government led by Pēteris Stučka, whose forces, supported by the Red Army, occupied almost all of the country; and the Baltic German government of the United Baltic Duchy, headed by Andrievs Niedra and supported by the Baltische Landeswehr and the German Freikorps unit Iron Division.
Estonian and Latvian forces[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] defeated the Germans at the Battle of Wenden in June 1919, and a massive attack by a predominantly German force—the West Russian Volunteer Army—under Pavel Bermondt-Avalov was repelled in November. Eastern Latvia was cleared of Red Army forces by Latvian and Polish troops in early 1920 (from the Polish perspective the Battle of Daugavpils was a part of the Polish-Soviet War).[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
A freely elected Constituent assembly convened on 1 May 1920, and adopted a liberal constitution, the Satversme, in February 1922.Bleiere, p. 155 The constitution was partly suspended by Kārlis Ulmanis after his coup in 1934 but reaffirmed in 1990. Since then, it has been amended and is still in effect in Latvia today. With most of Latvia's industrial base evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915, radical land reform was the central political question for the young state. In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by 1936, that percentage had been reduced to 18%.Bleiere, p. 195
By 1923, the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level. Innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy, but it soon suffered from the effects of the Great Depression. Latvia showed signs of economic recovery, and the electorate had steadily moved toward the centre during the parliamentary period.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] On 15 May 1934, Ulmanis staged a bloodless coup, establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1108059.stm|title=Timeline: Latvia|publisher=BBC News|date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2010-02-05[/tpl] After 1934, Ulmanis established government corporations to buy up private firms with the aim of "Latvianising" the economy.[tpl]cite book|jstor=2119564|author1=Nicholas Balabkins|author2=Arnolds P.

===Latvia in World War II===

Early in the morning of 24 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, called the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet "spheres of influence".Text of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, executed 23 August 1939 In the North, Latvia, Finland and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet sphere. Thereafter, Germany and the Soviet union invaded their respective portions of Poland.
After the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, most of the Baltic Germans left Latvia by agreement between Ulmanis' government and Nazi Germany under the Heim ins Reich programme.Lumans, pp. 71–74 In total 50,000 Baltic Germans left by the deadline of December 1939, with 1,600 remaining to conclude business and 13,000 choosing to remain in Latvia. Most of those who remained left for Germany in summer 1940, when a second resettlement [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] scheme was agreed.Lumans pp. 110–111
On 5 October 1939, Latvia was forced to accept a "mutual assistance" pact with the Soviet Union, granting the Soviets the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on Latvian territory.Lumans, p. 79 After staging border incidents, on 16 June 1940 the government of the USSR handed the Latvian ambassador in Moscow a note, in which Latvia was accused of breaching the articles of the agreement of 5 October 1939, and demands were made for sending in additional Soviet troops and to change the government. The Latvian government capitulated in the face of overwhelming force. On 17 June Soviet troops invaded Latvian territory. In his address by radio, Kārlis Ulmanis announced:  Soviet forces are marching into our land this very morning. This is happening with the knowledge and consent of the government, which in turn stems from the amicable relations that exist between Latvia and the Soviet Union. It is, therefore, my wish that the residents of our country also show friendship towards the advancing military units ... The government has resigned. I shall remain in my place, you remain in yours. 
No opposition was shown towards the Soviet forces; on the contrary, part of the population accepted the news of their arrival with enthusiasm, which was heavily exploited by Soviet propaganda.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] The well known Russian lawyer and public figure of Latvia, Pyotr Yakobi, wrote:  Taken from the German model, the authoritarian beginning in our country has turned into a government of national bureaucracy, having satisfied a limited circle of citizens, who have adapted themselves to the state pie. Clearly, any hardship is not in vain. And so now the down-trodden have raised their voice and demand a return of their rights that have been trampled on ...[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]  Those unhappy with the regime of Kārlis Ulmanis included people who were anxious about the deteriorating economic situation and had no desire to end up under Nazi German rule.
State administrators were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres,Wettig, Gerhard, Stalin and the Cold War in Europe, Rowman & Littlefield, Landham, Md, 2008, ISBN 0-7425-5542-9, page 20–21 in which 34,250 Latvians were deported or killed.[tpl]cite book|author=Simon Sebag Montefiore|authorlink=Simon Sebag Montefiore|title=Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar|page=334[/tpl] Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions. The resulting people's assembly immediately requested admission into the USSR, which the Soviet Union granted. Latvia, then a puppet gov
ernment, was headed by Augusts Kirhenšteins.Lumans, pp. 98–99 The Soviet Union incorporated Latvia on 5 August 1940, as The Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic.
The Soviets dealt harshly with their opponents – prior to the German invasion, in less than a year, at least 27,586 people were arrested. Most were deported for cooperating with the German army,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] and about 945 were shot.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] Under German occupation, Latvia was administered as part of Reichskommissariat Ostland. Latvian paramilitary and Auxiliary Police units established by the occupation authority participated in the Holocaust as well.
More than 200,000 Latvian citizens died during World War II, including approximately 75,000 Latvian Jews murdered during the Nazi occupation. Latvian soldiers fought on both sides of the conflict, including in the Latvian Legion of the Waffen-SS, most of them conscripted by the occupying Nazi and Soviet authorities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]

===Soviet era (1940–1941, 1944–1991)===

In 1944, when Soviet military advances reached the area, heavy fighting took place in Latvia between German and Soviet troops, which ended in another German defeat. In the course of the war, both occupying forces conscripted Latvians into their armies, in this way increasing the loss of the nation's "live resources". In 1944, part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control. The Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system. After the German surrender, it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay, and Latvian national partisans, soon joined by German collaborators, began to fight against the new occupier.Lumans, pp. 395–396
Anywhere from 120,000 to as many as 300,000 Latvians took refuge from the Soviet army by fleeing to Germany and Sweden.Lumans, p. 349 Most sources count 200,000 to 250,000 refugees leaving Latvia, with perhaps as many as 80,000 to 100,000 of them recaptured by the Soviets or, during few months immediately after the end of war,Lumans, pp. 384–385 returned by the West.Lumans, p. 391
The Soviets reoccupied the country in 1944–1945, and further deportations followed as the country was collectivised and Sovieticised. 
On 25 March 1949, 43,000 rural residents ("kulaks") and Latvian patriots ("nationalists") were deported to Siberia in a sweeping Operation Priboi in all three Baltic states, which was carefully planned and approved in Moscow already on 29 January 1949.[tpl]cite journal|author=Strods, Heinrihs; Kott, Matthew |year=2002|title=The File on Operation 'Priboi': A Re-Assessment of the Mass Deportations of 1949|journal=Journal of Baltic Studies |volume=33|issue=1|pages= 1–36|doi= 10.1080/01629770100000191[/tpl] Between 136,000 and 190,000 Latvians, depending on the sources, were imprisoned, repressed or deported to Soviet concentration camps (the Gulag) in the post war years, from 1945 to 1952.Lumans, pp. 398–399 Some managed to escape arrest and joined the partisans.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
In the post-war period, Latvia was made to adopt Soviet farming methods. Rural areas were forced into collectivisation.Bleiere, p. 384 An extensive programme to impose bilingualism was initiated in Latvia, limiting the use of Latvian language in official uses in favour of using Russian as the main language. All of the minority schools (Jewish, Polish, Belorussian, Estonian, Lithuanian) were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools: Latvian and Russian.Bleiere, p. 411 An influx of labourers, administrators, military personnel and their dependants from Russia and other Soviet republics started. By 1959 about 400,000 people arrived from other Soviet republics and the ethnic Latvian population had fallen to 62%.Bleiere, p. 418
Since Latvia had maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists, Moscow decided to base some of the Soviet Union's most advanced manufacturing in Latvia. New industry was created in Latvia, including a major machinery factory RAF in Jelgava, electrotechnical factories in Riga, chemical factories in Daugavpils, Valmiera and Olaine—and some food and oil processing plants.Bleiere, p. 379 Latvia manufactured trains, ships, minibuses, mopeds, telephones, radios and hi-fi systems, electrical and diesel engines, textiles, furniture, clothing, bags and luggage, shoes, musical instruments, home appliances, watches, tools and equipment, aviation and agricultural equipment and long list of other goods. Latvia had its own film industry and musical records factory (LPs). However, there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] To maintain and expand industrial production, skilled workers were migrating from all over the Soviet Union, decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic.Lumans, p. 400 Population of Latvia reached its peak in 1990 at just under 2.7 million people.

===Restoration of Independence in 1991===

In the second half of the 1980s, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union that were called glasnost and perestroika. In the summer of 1987, the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the Freedom Monument—a symbol of independence. In the summer of 1988, a national movement, coalescing in the Popular Front of Latvia, was opposed by the Interfront. The Latvian SSR, along with the other Baltic Republics was allowed greater autonomy, and in 1988, the old pre-war Flag of Latvia flew again, replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990.
In 1989, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted a resolution on the Occupation of the Baltic states, in which it declared the occupation "not in accordance with law," and not the "will of the Soviet people." Pro-independence Popular Front of Latvia candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the Supreme Council in the March 1990 democratic elections. On 4 May 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR adopted the Declaration On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia, and the Latvian SSR was renamed Republic of Latvia.
However, the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as a Soviet republic in 1990 and 1991.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] During the transitional period, Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia.
In spite of this, 73% of all Latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on 3 March 1991, in a nonbinding advisory referendum.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] The Popular Front of Latvia advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for Latvian citizenship. However, universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted. A majority of ethnic non-Latvians did not receive Latvian citizenship. Many of them were born in Latvia, but still became non-citizens. By 2011, more than half of non-citizens had taken naturalisation exams and received Latvian citizenship. Still, today there are 290,660 non-citizens in Latvia, which represent 14.1% of population. They have no citizenship of any country, and cannot vote in Latvia.
The Republic of Latvia declared the end of the transitional period and restored full independence on 21 August 1991, in the aftermath of the failed Soviet coup attempt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.finland.lv/public/default.aspx?nodeid=38439&contentlan=2&culture=en-US |title=History – Embassy of Finland, Riga |publisher=Embassy of Finland, Riga |quote=Latvia declared independence on 21 August 1991...The decision to restore diplomatic relations took effect on 29 August 1991 |date=2008-07-09 |accessdate=2010-09-02[/tpl]
The Saeima, Latvia's parliament, was again elected in 1993. Russia ended its military presence by completing its troop withdrawal in 1994 and shutting down the Skrunda-1 radar station in 1998. The major goals of Latvia in the 1990s, to join NATO and the European Union, were achieved in 2004.
Language and citizenship laws have been opposed by many Russophones. Citizenship was not automatically extended to former Soviet citizens who settled during the Soviet occupation, or to their offspring. Children born to non-nationals after the reestablishment of independence are automatically entitled to citizenship.

Latvia has a temperate climate that has been described in various sources as either  humid continental (Köppen Dfb) or oceanic/maritime[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liepu.lv/lv/404/latvia-and-liepaja-|publisher=Liepājas Universitāte|title=Latvia in crosscut[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gwp.org/en/About-GWP/Country-Water-Partnerships/Latvia/|publisher=Global Water Partnership|title=Latvia[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rpiva.lv/index.php?language=en&mh=struktura|publisher=RPIVA|title=Latvia in brief[/tpl] (Köppen Cfb.)
Coastal regions, especially the western coast of Courland Peninsula, possess a more maritime climate with cooler summers and milder winters, while eastern parts exhibit a more continental climate with warmer summers and harsher winters. Daugavpils in southeastern Latvia has been the site for both the lowest and highest temperatures ever recorded.
Latvia has four pronounced seasons of near-equal length. Winter starts in mid-December and lasts until mid-March. Winters have average temperatures of [tpl]convert|-6|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and are characterized by stable snow cover, bright sunshine, and short days. Severe spells of winter weather with cold winds, extreme temperatures of around [tpl]convert|-30|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and heavy snowfalls are common. Summer starts in June and lasts until August. Summers are usually warm and sunny, with cool evenings and nights. Summers have average temperatures of around [tpl]convert|19|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl], with extremes of [tpl]convert|35|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Spring and autumn bring fairly mild weather.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latvia.travel/en/climate-and-weather-conditions|title=The climate and weather conditions|publisher=Latvia.travel|accessdate=17 May 2012[/tpl]

===Environment===

Most of the country is composed of fertile lowland plains and moderate hills. In a typical Latvian landscape, a mosaic of vast forests alternates with fields, farmsteads, and pastures. Arable is spotted with birch groves and wooded clusters, which afford a habitat for numerous plants and animals. Latvia has hundreds of kilometres of undeveloped seashore—lined by pine forests, dunes, and continuous white sand beaches.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latvia.eu/content/nature-and-environment-latvia|title=Nature and Environment in Latvia|publisher=Latvian Institute|year=2002|accessdate=17 May 2012[/tpl]
Latvia has the 5th highest proportion of land covered by forests in the European Union, after Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Slovenia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STAT-13-154_en.htm |title=Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey 2012 Buildings, roads and other artificial areas cover 5% of the EU …and forests 40% |publisher=Eurostat Commission |date=25 October 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2014[/tpl] Forests account for [tpl]convert|3497000|ha|abbr=on[/tpl] or 56% of the total land area.
Latvia has over 12,500 rivers, which stretch for [tpl]convert|38000|km|abbr=on[/tpl]. Major rivers include the Daugava River, Lielupe, Gauja, Venta, and Salaca, the largest spawning ground for salmon in the eastern Baltics. There are 2,256 lakes that are bigger than [tpl]convert|1|ha|abbr=on[/tpl], with a collective area of [tpl]convert|1000|km2|abbr=on[/tpl]. Mires occupy 9.9% of Latvia's territory. Of these, 42% are raised bogs; 49% are fens; and 9% are transitional mires. 70% percent of the mires are untouched by civilisation, and they are a refuge for many rare species of plants and animals.
Agricultural areas account for [tpl]convert|1815900|ha|abbr=on[/tpl] or 29% of the total land area. With the dismantling of collective farms, the area devoted to farming decreased dramatically – now farms are predominantly small. Approximately 200 farms, occupying [tpl]convert|2750|ha|abbr=on[/tpl], are engaged in ecologically pure farming (i.e., using no artificial fertilisers or pesticides).
Latvia's national parks are Gauja National Park in Vidzeme (since 1973), Ķemeri National Park in Zemgale (1997), Slītere National Park in Kurzeme (1999) and Rāzna National Park in Latgale (2007).
Latvia has a long tradition of conservation. The first laws and regulations were promulgated in the 16th and 17th centuries. There are 706 specially state-level protected natural areas in Latvia, of which: 4 national parks, 1 biosphere reserve, 42 nature parks, 9 areas of protected landscapes, 260 nature reserves, 4 strict nature reserves, 355 nature monuments, 7 protected marine areas and 24 microreserves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.daba.gov.lv/public/eng/protected_areas/|title=Protected areas|publisher=Nature Conservation Agency Republic of Latvia|accessdate=17 May 2012[/tpl] Nationally protected areas account for [tpl]convert|12790|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] or around 20% of Latvia's total land area. Latvia's Red Book (Endangered Species List of Latvia), which was established in 1977, contains 112 plant species and 119 animal species. Latvia has ratified the international Washington, Bern, and Ramsare conventions.
The 2012 Environmental Performance Index ranks Latvia 2nd after Switzerland, based on the environmental performance of the country's policies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epi.yale.edu/epi2012/rankings|title=2012 Environmental Performance Index (EPI)|publisher=Yale University and Columbia University in collaboration with The World Economic Forum and European Commission|accessdate=17 May 2012[/tpl]
