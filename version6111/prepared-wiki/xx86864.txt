[[Ricardo Zamora Trophy]]

CATEGORIES: La Liga, Spanish football trophies and awards

The Ricardo Zamora Trophy ([tpl]lang-es|Trofeo Ricardo Zamora[/tpl]) is a football award, established by Spanish newspaper MARCA in 1958. The award goes to the goalkeeper who has the lowest "goals-to-games" ratio.Similar to goals against average in ice hockey or earned run average in baseball. It is named after legendary Spanish goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora.
In the inaugural year of the award, the winning goalkeeper had to play at least 15 league matches in the current season. In 1964, the limit for matches a goalkeeper had to play was raised to 22. In 1983, it was raised to 28 matches, including the rule that the goalkeeper had to play at least 60 minutes in match for it to count. 
In the last couple of years the list of goalkeepers who would have won the trophy prior to 1958 has been published. For these seasons, a limit of matches that the goalkeeper had to play has been applied. For the leagues with only 10 teams the limit of matches was 14, for those of 12 teams it was 17 and for those of 14 the limit was 20 matches. For those leagues of 16 teams it is 22 - as originally established for the trophy from 1964 to 1983.
