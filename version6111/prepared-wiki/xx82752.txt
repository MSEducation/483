==History==

The building is nearly a century old and has a varied history.

===Baptist Tabernacle (1898—1994)===

Dr. Len G. Broughton was recruited from Virginia to become pastor of Third Baptist Church in Atlanta in March 1898.  Within a year he had founded a new Baptist Tabernacle church on the southwest corner of Luckie and Harris streets (now the middle of Centennial Olympic Park).[tpl]Citation | last=Garrett | first=Franklin Miller | authorlink=Franklin Garrett |  year=1954| title=Atlanta and Environs: A Chronicle of Its People and Events, Volume II | publisher=University of Georgia Press | location=Athens, Georgia | pages=378–379 | oclc= 191446 | isbn=0-8203-0263-5[/tpl] Rev. Broughton was closely associated with the church in its early years, leading the local press to refer to it as "Broughton's Tabernacle," though this was never the official name of the church or any of its buildings.[tpl]Citation | title=Tabernacle Planning for Tenth Anniversary: Birthday of First Baptist Church Will Be Celebrated by Congregation | newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution | date=March 3, 1909 | volume=XLI | issue=261 | page=6 [/tpl] The new church was quite successful and had to be expanded several times to accommodate growth.[tpl]Citation | title=Rev.

right|thumb|The cornerstone of the building, placed March 1910. Seeing need for further growth, Broughton sought another location closer to the center of town, which led to the current property on Luckie St. However his Board of Deacons found the price too high and declined to buy it. As a result Broughton himself and a few of his deacons bought the property on July 7, 1906 and gave it to the church. The Atlanta Constitution reported the $52,000 transaction on its front page, reporting it as "one of the most important real estate and church transactions ever made in Atlanta" and described an auditorium "eight or ten stories in height" and estimated construction cost at $250,000.[tpl]Citation | title=Big Auditorium Is Planned By the Baptist Tabernacle at a Total Cost of $300,000 | newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution | date=July 9, 1906 | volume=XXXIX | issue=24 | page=1 [/tpl]
The building was designed by noted Chattanooga architect Reuben Harrison Hunt, along with three other buildings for the same site including a nurses dormitory and a hospital building. (None of these other buildings survive to the present day). The plans were revealed in November 1907 and depict a church building somewhat larger than what was finally constructed, extending all the way to the corner of Luckie and Spring Street (see photo).[tpl]Citation | title=Plans Accepted for Tabernacle; Work Will Begin | newspaper=The Atlanta Georgian and News | date=November 8, 1907 | volume=VI | issue=82 | page=7 | url=http://atlnewspapers.galileo.usg.edu/atlnewspapers/view?docId=news/aga1907/aga1907-4395.xml&query=architect%20hunt&brand=atlnewspapers-brand | accessdate=April 8, 2010 [/tpl]
Ground-breaking ceremonies were held for the new building on August 17, 1909, at which time the construction cost had been revised to $125,000.  At the time the membership of the church was 1,850 (up from 350 at its founding ten years before).  Broughton, who was preaching at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church at the time, was not present at the ground-breaking.[tpl]Citation | title=Dirt Is Broken For Tabernacle : Appropriate Ceremonies Held on Luckie St. Lot | newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution | date=August 18, 1909 | volume=XLII | issue=64 | page=7 [/tpl]
The cornerstone for the building was laid at the end of the 1910 Bible Conference held at the church.  Immediately after a sermon by F. B. Meyer on March 9, 1910, an "immense crowd" adjourned to the construction site.  Meyer said at the ceremony, "I believe that this will be an historic occasion, not only in the history of the church, but not unworthy to be chronicled in the history of this great and beautiful city."  Paul Dwight Moody (son of D.L. Moody) also spoke at the ceremony.  Broughton placed some papers in the stone including that day's program, the membership roll of the church and a list of officers. He capped the stone and sealed it with mortar.[tpl]Citation | title=Tabernacle Cornerstone Is Placed In Position Before Immense Crowd | newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution | date=March 10, 1910 | volume=XLII | issue=268 | page=4 [/tpl]
The structure measures 147 by 130 feet with an exterior of red brick trimmed by granite. The style is neoclassical with Ionic columns and arches on the facade.[tpl]Citation | title=From Meetinghouse to Megachurch: A Material and Cultural History | first=Anne C. | last=Loveland | first2=Otis B. | last2=Wheeler | pages=91–93 | location=Columbia, Missouri | publisher=University of Missouri Press | year=2003 | isbn=0-8262-1480-0 | url= http://books.google.com/?id=2SjXNHvt3AIC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=tabernacle+broughton+architect | accessdate=2009-01-28 [/tpl] The auditorium would seat 4,000 people (including the galleries) and the Sunday school facilities below could seat 3,000.  The rostrum could accommodate a chorus of 500 people and featured a pipe organ that cost $15,000.  The original planned opening was in May 1911,[tpl]Citation | title=New Baptist Tabernacle, Modern and Elegant, Will Be Opened May 31; Old Church For Sale | newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution | date=January 27, 1911 [/tpl] but this was eventually delayed.
The first services in the new building were held on September 3, 1911 beginning with a Sunday school at 9:30 (attended by 2,000).  The doors opened for the main service at 10:40 am, by which time some people had been waiting two hours to enter.[tpl]Citation | title=Shot At Russell Taken By Pastor: Dr. Broughton Attacks the Local Option Platform | newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution | date=September 4, 1911 | volume=XLIV | issue=81 | page=1 [/tpl]  A week-long dedication for the church was held from September 10–17, 1911, during which as many as 8,000 people crowded into the auditorium and hundreds more were turned away.
On the very first day in the new building, Broughton gave a sermon criticizing local politicians for standing in the way of prohibition.  Aside from the  temperance movement, Broughton was outspoken on other political issues, and over the coming years he would have guest speakers appear at the Tabernacle toward this end.  These included (then Vice President elect) Calvin Coolidge,[tpl]Citation | title=Coolidge Arrives Today to Attend Tariff Congress | newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution | date=January 26, 1921 | page=1 | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/ajc_historic/access/515871752.html?dids=515871752:515871752&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Jan+26,+1921&author=&pub=The+Atlanta+Constitution&desc=COOLIDGE+ARRIVES+TODAY+TO+ATTEND+TARIFF+CONGRESS&pqatl=google | accessdate=2009-01-28 [/tpl] Frank Hanly[tpl]Citation | title=Hanly Declares He Hates Liquor | newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution | date=March 13, 1915 | page=7 | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/ajc_historic/access/553002262.html?dids=553002262:553002262&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Mar+13,+1915&author=&pub=The+Atlanta+Constitution&desc=HANLY+DECLARES+HE+HATES+LIQUOR&pqatl=google | accessdate=2009-01-28 [/tpl] and others.

The congregation reached its peak in the 1950s with a membership of over 3,000.  However, the phenomenon of white flight caused the church to go into decline in the decades afterward.  By the 1980s, attendance at the church had dwindled to around 500, and it had trouble attracting a permanent pastor.[tpl]Citation | title=Tabernacle Turns 90, Seeks Pastor To Spur Renewal | author=Niebuhr, Gustav | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=November 13, 1988 | page=1C [/tpl]
An attempt by the city government to give the building historic status was resisted in 1989, the members citing a loan plan necessary to insure the survival of the church.[tpl]Citation | title=Tabernacle Says 'Historic' Status Will Ensure Its Demise | author=Cordell, Actor | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Intown Extra | date=November 16, 1989 | page=5D [/tpl] The congregation's troubles continued after that, leading a later pastor to attempt a fast to encourage donations to save the church.  (At this time the church was making ends meet via revenue from the two adjacent parking lots which it owned).[tpl]Citation | title=Minister is fasting for financial deliverance | author=Cordell, Actor | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Intown Extra | date=January 3, 1991 | page=4E [/tpl] These efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. In December 1991 the congregation, then numbering about 100, voted to cease having services there and ordered the trustees to find a buyer for the building.[tpl]Citation | title=Faithful to the end: The remaining members of Luckie Street church agree it's time to close up | author=Laccetti, Susan | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=February 22, 1992 | page=6E [/tpl]
The building's history as a church ended on Friday, October 14, 1994 when it was sold (along with the offices and the two parking lots) for $2.2 million to a group of investors led by James B. Cumming who intended to redevelop the area in conjunction with the 1996 Summer Olympics.  Its position just across from Centennial Olympic Park made it very attractive as a potential Olympic entertainment venue.[tpl]Citation | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADA14DB9C38422&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=Historic downtown church sold to Olympic investors | first=Sallye | last=Salter | newspaper=Atlanta Journal & Constitution | page=C-1 | date=October 15, 1994 | accessdate=2009-01-27 [/tpl]

===House of Blues (1996—1997)===

At least two different teams attempted to develop the building as a venue for the Olympics with little success.[tpl]Citation | title=Business Report - Commercial Real Estate - New team heading Tabernacle project | last=Salter | first=Sallye | date=May 14, 1995 | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal and Constitution | page=D-2 | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/AT/lib00003,0EADA1C5973D3ADD.html | accessdate=2009-02-02 [/tpl] As the event approached, it looked for a time that no deal would come together.  Then, in April 1996, Isaac Tigrett visited Atlanta with other investors and cut a deal to open a House of Blues in the building in time for the Olympics.  Prior to this, Atlanta had not been a planned expansion location for House of Blues.[tpl]Citation | title=Courtship with House of Blues was just a fling | first=Michael | last=Hinkelman | date=August 23, 1996 | newspaper=Atlanta Business Chronicle | page= | url=http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/1996/08/26/editorial1.html | accessdate=August 10, 2009 [/tpl] Tigrett gave his partner Lance Sterling the go-ahead for the project with only 45 days available, even after Sterling had told him even 60 days was too short a time.  Despite this short lead time, the venue was ready when the Olympics opened in July 1996.[tpl]Citation | title=Cash flow intact, Tabernacle ready to roll | last=Saporta | first=Maria | date=March 27, 1998 | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal and Constitution | page=H-3 | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/AT/lib00003,0EADA3A4A6686ABD.html | accessdate=2009-02-02 [/tpl]

Civic leaders in Atlanta had high hopes that House of Blues would continue as a permanent downtown attraction, especially when the lease was extended through January 1997. But immediately after the Olympics were finished, word came that it would shut down.[tpl]Citation | title=Future uncertain for two nightlife attractions - House of Blues is considering closing at the end of the month; "Pomp Duck and Circumstance" plans to reopen in September with a scaled-back show.  | author=Salter, Sallye | author2=DeVault, Russ | date=August 9, 1996 | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal and Constitution | page=F-1 | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/AT/lib00003,0EADA2A02866963B.html | accessdate=2009-02-02 [/tpl] Efforts were launched to convince Tigrett to continue in Atlanta, but the local investment money he insisted upon ($4 million by some accounts) could not be found.
Some concerts were held at the venue under the House of Blues name beginning in 1997 through the efforts of Lance Sterling.  The trial run began on Wednesday, November 12, 1997 with a concert by Hall & Oates.[tpl]Citation | title=Hall & Oates begin trial run for reopened House of Blues | author=Longino, Miriam | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |  page=C8 | date=November 13, 1997 [/tpl] House of Blues ended its relationship with Atlanta when its lease expired for the last time in January 1998.  City leaders continued negotiations with Sterling, who said "This is the premier venue in the Southeast.  I am personally committed to making downtown Atlanta a venue, and I'm calling everybody I know to make this happen."[tpl]Citation | title=House of Blues won't call Atlanta home | last=Saporta | first=Maria | date=January 15, 1998 | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal | page=C-2 | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/AT/lib00003,0EADA3888CD0C155.html | accessdate=2009-02-02 [/tpl]

===The Tabernacle (1998—present)===

On March 11, 1998 Lance Sterling announced that he had entered into a 30 year lease agreement and was investing $2 million of his own money to develop the building.  The venue was renamed The Tabernacle at this time.  The reopening was set for March 28, the same day that Centennial Olympic Park was set to reopen across the street.[tpl]Citation | title=Former House of Blues reopening in downtown as the Tabernacle | last=Saporta | first=Maria | date=March 12, 1998 | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal and Constitution | page=F-2 | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/AT/lib00003,0EADA39E998BCCAC.html | accessdate=2009-02-02 [/tpl]  The Tabernacle operated as a successful concert venue under Sterling's management for almost two years.
Eventually Sterling (whose home is in California) found the business was conflicting with his family life.  "I would spend a week there and a week home. It was just too much," he said.[tpl]Citation | title=Canyon Club fills entertainment void | author= | date=March 8, 2001 | newspaper=The Acorn | page= | url=http://www.theacorn.com/news/2001-03-08/On_the%3Cbr%3ETown/Canyon_Club_fills_entertainment_void.html | accessdate=August 10, 2009 [/tpl] He sold his interest in the building to SFX Entertainment (now Live Nation) on December 17, 1999.
At the same time as the SFX sale, local music promoters Alex Cooley and Peter Conlon announced that they would move their Cotton Club to the basement of the building (the former Sunday school room) as an additional feature of the venue.[tpl]Citation | title=Tabernacle sold; Cotton Club moving in | last=DeVault | first=Russ | date=December 18, 1999 | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal and Constitution | page=E1 | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/AT/lib00003,0EADA4D1B116EAB7.html | accessdate=2009-02-02 [/tpl] Cotton Club reopened Friday, February 11, 2000 with a show by Staind.[tpl]Citation | title=Cotton Club reopens doors at Tabernacle | author= | date=February 9, 2000 | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal and Constitution | page=B2 | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADA4FB1327CE72&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | accessdate=2009-02-02 [/tpl] Cotton Club operated in the lower level of The Tabernacle until November 20, 2004.

The Tabernacle continues as a major concert venue in Atlanta into 2013. Conan O'Brien hosted a week of Conan shows at The Tabernacle between April 1—4, 2013.http://teamcoco.com/Atlantahttp://teamcoco.com/atlanta-ticket-info

===March 2008 tornado===

On March 14, 2008, the Tabernacle sustained extensive damage when a tornado tore through downtown Atlanta.  Windows were blown out and the roof was severely damaged.  A broken water pipe caused additional damage.[tpl]Citation | url=http://www.ajc.com/search/content/news/stories/2008/03/16/landmark0316.html | title=Atlanta Tornado: The Aftermath: Landmarks Take a Hit | author=Cook, Rhonda Cook et al. | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal and Constitution | date=March 16, 2008 | accessdate=August 10, 2009 [/tpl]   It was the first tornado to hit the downtown area since weather record keeping began in late 1878, or unofficially at any time in the city's history.name="ajctornado">[tpl]Citation | url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/atlanta/stories/2008/03/14/domeburst_0315.html?cxntlid=homepage_tab_newstab | title=Friday tornado pummels downtown; Saturday storm kills 2 | author=Eberly, Tim | author2=Shea, Paul | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal and Constitution | date=March 15, 2008 | accessdate=August 10, 2009 [/tpl][/ref]
Major repairs and restoration took less than two months, working around the clock.  Because the ornate plasterwork on the ceiling could not be repaired, drywall and molding were used to re-create the same designs.  The original painter from the 1996 opening was found to repaint the repaired sections.  Upgrades were also done to electrical and other systems.

===February 2014===

Shortly after the beginning of a Panic! At the Disco concert, the building was evacuated due to possible cracking in the floor.name="ajcevacuation">[tpl]Citation | url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/the-tabernacle-evacuated-due-to-shaky-floors/ndHTG/ | title=Downtown Atlanta concert hall evacuated amid reports of cracked floor | author=Stevens, Alexis | newspaper=The Atlanta Journal and Constitution | date=February 7, 2014 | accessdate=February 8, 2014[/tpl][/ref]
