==Background and recording==

Originally, Pope was the lead vocalist for the American rock band Hey Monday, which went on hiatus in 2011. While each member pursued in their own side projects, Pope decided to go solo and auditioned for the third season of the popular singing competition The Voice in 2012.
After turning the chairs of all four judges in the Blind Audition round, she chose country singer Blake Shelton to be her mentor. Pope advanced through to all ten rounds of the competition and eventually won the title of winner of The Voice 2012, while also achieving a high number of downloads of covers of songs she sang on the show that regularly topped the iTunes sales charts along the way.
In January 2013, Pope became signed to the country music label Republic Nashville - an imprint of Big Machine Records - and immediately began work on her solo debut studio album with producers Dann Huff and Nathan Chapman.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===

 
The album received mostly mixed to positive reviews, with most of the criticism targeting its pop-styled production and a lack of originality. Markso Papadatos of Digital Journal responded very positively to the album, noting that it "showcases Pope's powerful vocals and her superb storytelling ability." He concluded by rating Frame by Frame an A. Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the album four stars; he described Frame by Frame as "exactly the kind of crossover-ready record that was expected" from Pope, drawing comparisons to country-pop artists Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood, and stated that every track had single potential. Bjorke went on to praise Pope's emotive vocal delivery and strength as a singer-songwriter. Allmusic gave the album three-out-of-five stars. Reviewer Steve Leggett commented on the diverse lyrical subject matter and noted that Pope's performances were "very good" but forgettable. The review also questioned Frame by Frame being marketed as country music: "It isn't really country, at least not in the old sense, instead being that kind of thinly veneered pop that passes for country these days." Victoria Patneaude of Alter the Press! gave the album a glowing review, noting that despite "some less-than-stellar moments", Pope successfully "found exactly where she belongs" in the music industry and delivered a strong debut. "This release is a testament to  how far Cassadee has come and how far she is planning to go," Patneaude explains, "So move over, Taylor Swift, there's a new country pop princess here to take the throne."
Country music blog Taste of Country described the album as "America's introduction to Pope as a songwriter," and asserted that "she shows promise" in this regard. Their review also highlighted that Pope's "undeniable pop-rock influences" resulted in a country-pop mix that "will be unique on country radio".[tpl]cite web|title=Album Spotlight: Cassadee Pope, ‘Frame by Frame’|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/cassadee-pope-frame-by-frame/|work=Taste of Country|publisher=Townsquare Media|accessdate=11 October 2013[/tpl]  Country Weekly reviewer Jon Freeman rated the album "B+", saying that "A word of caution for fans wanting to hear some twang: this one probably isn't for you. That said, Cassadee is a tremendous vocalist and Frame by Frame wisely sticks to narratives that dig deeper into her life". He praised the writing of "Wasting All These Tears" and "11", and compared the album's sound to Avril Lavigne.
HitFix editor Melinda Newman was more critical of the "generic, slick country pop" sound and songs that sounded "like they could have gone to any number of female pop singers." However, Newman complimented Pope's "powerful and rich", if not particularly distinctive, voice, and suggested that Pope could be the first Voice winner to succeed in the industry. She gave the album a C+ rating. Brian Cantor of entertainment news blog Headline Planet cited a lack of artistic identity as the album's greatest weakness. "Poor strategy, indecisive branding and generic songwriting irrefutably plague the album," Cantor explains. Though disappointed with the project overall, Cantor praised Pope as an artist, who he deemed charismatic, promising and unique, and highlighted the few "winners" on the album.[tpl]cite web|last=Cantor|first=Brian|title=Identity Issues Plague Cassadee Pope’s "Frame by Frame," Album Review|url=http://headlineplanet.com/home/2013/10/08/cassadee-pope-frame-by-frame-review/|work=Headline Planet|publisher=Cantortainment Company|accessdate=9 October 2013[/tpl] Newsday′s Glenn Gamboa was also critical, giving the album a C+ and commenting that Pope "may want to claim a country base, but her vocals are still closer to Avril Lavigne than Carrie Underwood" and that "songs like "Wasting All These Tears" feel hollow and misplaced".[tpl]cite web|last=Gamboa|first=Glenn|title=Cassadee Pope's 'Frame by Frame' review: Hardly believable|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/cassadee-pope-s-frame-by-frame-review-hardly-believable-1.6198945|publisher=Newsday[/tpl]
