Bibliomania can be a symptom of obsessive–compulsive disorder which involves the collecting or  even hoarding of books to the point where social relations or health are damaged.

==Description==

One of several unusual behaviors associated with books, bibliomania is characterized by the collecting of books which have no use to the collector nor any great intrinsic value to a genuine book collector. The purchase of multiple copies of the same book and edition and the accumulation of books beyond possible capacity of use or enjoyment are frequent symptoms of bibliomania. Bibliomania is not a psychological disorder recognized by the DSM-IV.
The term was coined by John Ferriar (1761-1815), a physician at the Manchester Royal Infirmary.Kendall, Joshua. The man who made lists: love, death, madness, and the creation of Roget's Thesaurus, Penguin Group, USA, 2008, p. 154. Ferriar coined the term in 1809 in a poem he dedicated to his bibliomanic friend, Richard Heber (1773-1833).[tpl]cite book|last=Ferriar|first=John|title=The Bibliomania, An Epistle to Richard Heber, Esq.|year=1809|publisher=T.

In 1809, the Reverend Thomas Frognall Dibdin published Bibliomania; or Book Madness, a work described by literary critic Philip Connell as "a series of bizarre rambling dialogues which together comprised a kind of dramatized mock pathology, lavishly illustrated and, in the second edition, embellished with extensive footnotes on bibliography and the history of book collecting".[tpl]cite journal|last=Connell|first=Philip|title=Bibliomania: Book Collecting, Cultural Politics, and the Rise of Literary Heritage in Romantic Britain|journal=Representations|date=Summer 2000|year=2000|volume=71|pages=24–47|doi=10.1525/rep.2000.71.1.01p00764[/tpl] The "symptoms" displayed by the biblomaniacs in Dibdin's work include "an obsession with uncut copies, fine paper or vellum pages, unique copies, first editions, blackletter books, illustrated copies, association copies, and condemned or suppressed works".[tpl]cite journal|last=Connell|first=Philip|title=Bibliomania: Book Collecting, Cultural Politics, and the Rise of Literary Heritage in Romantic Britain|journal=Representations|date=Summer 2000|year=2000|volume=71|pages=24–47|doi=10.1525/rep.2000.71.1.01p00764[/tpl]

==Other book-related conditions==

Bibliomania is not to be confused with bibliophilia, which is the usual love of books and is not considered a clinical psychological disorder.
Other abnormal behaviours involving books include book-eating (bibliophagy), compulsive book-stealing (bibliokleptomania), and book-burying (bibliotaphy).
