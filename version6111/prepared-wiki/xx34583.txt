[[Guardians of the directions]]

CATEGORIES: Guardians of the directions, Buddhist cosmology, Hindu gods, Lokapalas

The Guardians of the Directions (Sanskrit: दिक्पाल, Dikpāla) are the deities who rule the specific directions of space according to Hinduism and [tpl]IAST|Vajrayāna[/tpl] Buddhism—especially [tpl]IAST|Kālacakra[/tpl]. As a group of eight deities, they are called [tpl]IAST|Aṣṭa-Dikpāla[/tpl] (अष्ट-दिक्पाल), literally meaning guardians of eight directions. They are often augmented with two extra deities for the ten directions (the two extra directions being zenith and nadir), when they are known as the [tpl]IAST|Daśa-dikpāla[/tpl]. In Hinduism it is traditional to represent their images on the walls and ceilings of Hindu temples. Ancient Java and Bali Hinduism recognize [tpl]IAST|Nava-Dikpāla[/tpl], literally meaning guardians of nine directions, that consist of eight directions with one addition in the center. The nine guardian gods of directions is called Dewata Nawa Sanga (Nine guardian devata), the diagram of these guardian gods of directions is featured in Surya Majapahit, the emblem of Majapahit empire.
There are strong similarities between the concept of the guardians of the directions and the lore surrounding the Chinese four symbols, four ancestral spirits who are responsible for four of the cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West).
