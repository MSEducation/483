Kristin Halvorsen (born 2 September 1960 in) is a Norwegian socialist politician. She served as Minister of Finance from 17 October 2005 to 20 October 2009 and as Minister of Education from 20 October 2009 to 16 October 2013. 
Taking over as leader of the Socialist Left Party in 1997, she established an unprecedented level of consensus within the party. At the 2005 election, the party received a disappointing 8.8% share of the vote, and in 2009 down further, to 6.2%. Many who describe themselves as being on the left side of the party have suggested that Halvorsen step down. She was succeeded by Audun Lysbakken on 11 March 2012. 
The Socialist Left, in coalition with the Labour Party and the Centre Party, won Norway's September 2005 parliamentary elections. The resulting Red-Green coalition government marked the first time that the Socialist Left Party was included in the cabinet. Kristin Halvorsen took office as the 78th Minister of Finance in Norwegian history and the first woman ever to serve in that post.
She resigned as leader of the Socialist Left Party in 2012.

==Controversies==

===Kindergarten coverage promise===

In the electoral campaign of the 2005 election Halvorsen announced that she would leave politics if the government would not be able to provide all citizens with kindergarten for their children by the end of 2007, and proclaimed that "this is so important for me that you'll get rid of me if we don't accomplish this".[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.dinside.no/344522/halvorsen-gaar-ikke-likevel|title=Halvorsen går ikke likevel|work=DinSide|date=23 October 2006|language=no|archivedate=16 July 2011 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.dinside.no/344522/halvorsen-gaar-ikke-likevel[/tpl] While she stood firmly by her announcement even two months after the election,[tpl]cite news|language=no|work=Aftenposten|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/article1159399.ece|title=Halvorsen: - Full barnehagedekning, ellers går jeg av|trans_title=Halvorsen: - Full day care, or I go|date=18 November 2005|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20091130140636/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/article1159399.ece|archivedate=4 August 2007[/tpl] she in October 2006 simply withdrew her promise, stating that "what I have said is that we'll have full coverage in 2007. But nobody will get rid of me if full coverage is missing in one or two municipalities". By the end of 2007, 90 percent of municipalities will be able to offer kindergarten for all applicants, with the not fully covered constituting approximately 43 municipalities in Norway.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/innenriks/politikk/article1499939.ece|title=Bryter barnehageløftet|work=Nettavisen|first=Berit|last=Almendingen|date=18 December 2007|language=no|archivedate=21 June 2007|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080219223755/http://www.nettavisen.no/innenriks/politikk/article1499939.ece[/tpl]

===Poverty resolved "with the stroke of a pen" claim===

In the same electoral campaign she claimed that poverty in Norway could be eliminated "with the stroke of a pen". After being elected to government and becoming Minister of Finance, by the end of the four-year term she had not accomplished this, as homelessness was actually increasing. When attending a television program during the 2009 electoral campaign, she also refused to apologise to the poor in Norway for her failure.[tpl]cite news|work=Nettavisen|first=Jars joakim|last=Skarvøy|date=20 August 2009 |url=http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/valg/article2689741.ece|title=Nekter å be de fattige om unnskyldning|archivedate=22 August 2009|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090822080705/http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/valg/article2689741.ece[/tpl]

On 5 January 2006, Halvorsen caused a controversy by calling for boycott of Israeli products as a sign of solidarity with the Palestinians The government and the other parties in the coalition distanced themselves from these remarks,[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1192476.ece|title=SV's boycott call embarrasses government|newspaper=Aftenposten|accessdate=27 January 2010 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1192476.ece|archivedate=12 January 2006[/tpl] and Halvorsen later apologized.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=3701224|title=Kristin Halvorsen beklager boikott-uttalelser|trans_title=Kristin Halvorsen apologizes about boycott statements|language=no |newspaper=Verdens Gang|author=Hege Lyngved Odinsen|date=1 June 2006|accessdate=27 January 2010|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20120531070202/http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=3701224|title=Kristin Halvorsen beklager boikott-uttalelser|archivedate=11 April 2014[/tpl]
