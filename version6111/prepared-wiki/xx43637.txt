[[Cyclotomic polynomial]]

CATEGORIES: Number theory, Algebra

==Examples==

If n is a prime number then 
If n=2p where p is an odd prime number then
For  n up to 10 we have:
For n up to 30, the cyclotomic polynomials not covered by above formulas are:
The case of 105 is interesting because it is the first integer that is the product of three distinct odd prime numbers and the 105th cyclotomic polynomial is the first one that has a coefficient of magnitude greater than 1:

==Properties==

===Fundamental tools===

The cyclotomic polynomials are monic polynomials with integer coefficients that are irreducible over the field of the rational numbers. Except for n equal to 1 or 2, they are palindromic polynomials of even degree.
A fundamental relation involving cyclotomic polynomials is 
which means that each n-th root of unity is a primitive d-th root of unity for a unique d dividing n.

===Easy cases for the computation===

As noted above, if n is a prime number then
If n is an odd integer greater than one, then 
If n is an even integer, then 
In particular, if n=2p is twice an odd prime then (as noted above)
If n=pm is a prime power (where p is prime), then
More generally, if n=qmr with m>1 then 
This allows to give formulas for the nth cyclotomic polynomial when n has at most one odd prime factor: If p is an odd prime number, and h and k are positive integers, then: 

===Integers appearing as coefficients===

The problem of bounding the magnitude of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomials has been the object of a number of research papers.
Let A(n) denote the maximum absolute value of the coefficients of Φn.  It is known that for any positive k, the number of n up to x with A(n) > nk is at least c(k)⋅x for a positive c(k) depending on k and x sufficiently large.  In the opposite direction, for any function ψ(n) tending to infinity with n we have A(n) bounded above by nψ(n) for almost all n.Meier (2008)

===Gauss's formula===

Let n be odd, square-free, and greater than 3. ThenGauss, DA, Articles 356-357Riesel, pp. 315-316, p. 436
where  both An(z) and Bn(z) have integer coefficients, An(z) has degree φ(n)/2, and Bn(z) has degree φ(n)/2 − 2. Furthermore, An(z) is palindromic when its degree is even; if its degree is odd it is antipalindromic. Similarly, Bn(z) is palindromic unless n is composite and ≡ 3 (mod 4), in which case it is antipalindromic.
The first few cases are

where  both Un(z) and Vn(z) have integer coefficients, Un(z) has degree φ(n)/2, and Vn(z) has degree φ(n)/2 − 1. This can also be written
If n is even, square-free and greater than 2 (this forces n to be ≡ 2 (mod 4)),
where  both Cn(z) and Dn(z) have integer coefficients, Cn(z) has degree φ(n), and Dn(z) has degree φ(n) − 1. Cn(z) and Dn(z) are both palindromic.
The first few cases are:
