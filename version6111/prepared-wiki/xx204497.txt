CATEGORIES: Farm to Market Roads in Texas

Farm to Market Road 655 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Texas. Ninety-nine percent of FM 655 is a private road for the Texas Department of Corrections, as the Ramsey, Terrell, and Stringfellow units are on this highway. The road itself is five miles (8 km) long, and at the end of the road, there is an FM 655 "spur" to either the left or right, for prison access. Both spurs combined are around two miles (3 km) long.

==Route description==

FM 655 begins as two spurs at the Ramsey, Stringfellow, and Terrell units of the Texas Department of Corrections in Brazoria County. The mainline of FM 655 follows the northern spur while the FM 655 spur follows the southern spur, with both beginning at prison buildings and heading through farm fields before joining. From here, FM 655 continues east through farmland within the prison. After leaving the prison, the highway heads into Bonney and ends at FM 521.[tpl]google maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Farm+to+Market+Rd+655&daddr=Farm+to+Market+Rd+655+to:Farm+to+Market+Rd+655&hl=en&sll=29.299704,-95.535522&sspn=0.009076,0.021136&geocode=FQRAvwEdADBO-g%3BFYsfvwEdCYVP-g%3BFajdvgEdwBpO-g&vpsrc=0&mra=ls&t=h&z=13|title=overview of Farm to Market Road 655|accessdate=October 27, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite map|publisher=Texas Department of Transportation|title=County Grid Map 564|url=http://www.txdot.gov/travel/countymapbook2006/Pages/564.pdf|year=2010|accessdate=October 27, 2011[/tpl]
