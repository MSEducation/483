==Biography==

===Early life===

DJ Ötzi was born Gerhard Friedle in St. Johann, Tirol, and is the son of DJ Anton Friedle. Shortly after birth, his mother, age 17-years at the time, gave him up for adoption. He was raised by foster parents and later by his paternal grandparents in the nearby village of Erpfendorf in Tirol. At a young age he suffered from epilepsy, at age 16, his avulsion from home, landed him for a short time homelessness living on the streets. His career arose gradually, first working as a student cook, then on being discovered at a karaoke competition, went on to work as an entertainer (animateur), disc jockey and singer in discothèques around Austria, as well as tourist destinations Majorca and Turkey. Since childhood, he has endured several setbacks in his life, which continued in recent years with doctors diagnosing testicular cancer, that he defeated, only to be confronted in 2002, before the birth of his daughter, with a severe form of conductive hearing loss.[tpl]cite news|url=http://derstandard.at/1071050/DJ-Oetzi-erlitt-schweren-Hoersturz|title=DJ Ötzi erlitt schweren Hörsturz|trans_title=DJ Ötzi suffers severe loss of hearing|accessdate=2014-02-21|location=Vienna|work=derStandard.at|publisher=STANDARD Medien AG|language=German|date=2002-09-14[/tpl]

His first song, which propelled his career in 1999, titled "Anton aus Tirol", became a successful hit in the German-speaking regions. The song remained No. 1 in the Austrian Charts for 75 weeks, followed soon after by "Hey Baby" in the English-speaking regions, a cover version of Bruce Channel's 1962 song.
He released a cover version of "A Ram Sam Sam", called the "Burger Dance", which peaked No. 1 in Germany and No. 3 in Austria.
