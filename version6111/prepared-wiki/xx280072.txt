===Velodrome===

The velodrome of the National Cycling Centre was built in 1994 for Manchester Olympic bids. It was Britain's first indoor cycling track. It hosted track cycling events in the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the Revolution series and the UCI Track Cycling World Championships a record three times (1996, 2000 and 2008). More than 15 track cycling world records has been set on the track. The velodrome has been cited as a catalyst for Britain's successes in track cycling since 2002 and nowadays claims to be one of the busiest in the world.[tpl]Cite news |title=How did Britain get so good at cycling? |quote=As well as bringing in the finest equipment and the best coaches available, British Cycling based everything on one oval track in Manchester, built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. |last=Andrews |first=Guy |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/apr/01/cycling.features |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=2012-07-13[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |title=British pedal power or Queally over-rated? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics2000/sports_talk/930224.stm |work=BBC News |date=20 September 2000 |accessdate=2012-07-13[/tpl]
