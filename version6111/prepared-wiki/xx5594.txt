Kevlar is the registered trademark for a para-aramid synthetic fiber, related to other aramids such as Nomex and Technora. Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965,Stephanie Kwolek, Hiroshi Mera and Tadahiko Takata “High-Performance Fibers” in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. [tpl]DOI|10.1002/14356007.a13_001[/tpl]Wholly Aromatic Carbocyclic Polycarbonamide Fiber Original Kevlar patent awarded in 1974 to Stephanie Kwolek this high strength material was first commercially used in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires. Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components.
Currently, Kevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to body armor because of its high tensile strength-to-weight ratio; by this measure it is 5 times stronger than steel on an equal weight basis.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.dupont.com/kevlar/whatiskevlar.html | title=What is Kevlar | publisher=DuPont | accessdate=2007-03-28 [/tpl] It is also used to make modern drumheads that withstand high impact. When used as a woven material, it is suitable for mooring lines and other underwater applications.
A similar fiber called Twaron with roughly the same chemical structure was developed by Akzo in the 1970s; commercial production started in 1986, and Twaron is now manufactured by Teijin.Tatsuya Hongū, Glyn O.

==History==

Poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide – branded Kevlar – was invented by Polish-American chemist Stephanie Kwolek while working for DuPont,[tpl]cite web |title=Inventing Modern America: Insight — Stephanie Kwolek: |url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/www/ima/kwolek_bio.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.mit.edu%2Finvent%2Fwww%2Fima%2Fkwolek_bio.html&date=2009-05-24 | publisher=Lemelson-MIT program |archivedate=May 24, 2009 |accessdate=May 24, 2009[/tpl] in anticipation of a gasoline shortage. In 1964, her group began searching for a new lightweight strong fiber to use for light but strong tires. The polymers she had been working with at the time, poly-p-Phenylene-terephthalate and polybenzamide,[tpl]cite web |title=Stephanie Louise Kwolek Biography |url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/stephanie-louise-kwolek-woi/ |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bookrags.com%2Fbiography%2Fstephanie-louise-kwolek-woi%2F&date=2009-05-24 |publisher=Bookrags |archivedate=May 24, 2009 |accessdate=May 24, 2009 |title=World of Invention Biography[/tpl] formed liquid crystal while in solution, something unique to those polymers at the time. 
The solution was "cloudy, opalescent upon being stirred, and of low viscosity" and usually was thrown away. However, Kwolek persuaded the technician, Charles Smullen, who ran the "spinneret", to test her solution, and was amazed to find that the fiber did not break, unlike nylon. Her supervisor and her laboratory director understood the significance of her accidental discovery and a new field of polymer chemistry quickly arose. By 1971, modern Kevlar was introduced. However, Kwolek was not very involved in developing the applications of Kevlar.[tpl]cite web |first=Jim |last=Quinn|title=I was able to be Creative and work as hard as I wanted|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2003/3/2003_3_60.shtml |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanheritage.com%2Farticles%2Fmagazine%2Fit%2F2003%2F3%2F2003_3_60.shtml&date=2009-05-24 |publisher=American Heritage Publishing|archivedate=May 24, 2009 |accessdate=May 24, 2009[/tpl]

==Production==

Kevlar is synthesized in solution from the monomers 1,4-phenylene-diamine (para-phenylenediamine) and terephthaloyl chloride in a condensation reaction yielding hydrochloric acid as a byproduct. The result has liquid-crystalline behavior, and mechanical drawing orients the polymer chains in the fiber's direction. Hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) was the solvent initially used for the polymerization, but for safety reasons, DuPont replaced it by a solution of N-methyl-pyrrolidone and calcium chloride. As this process was patented by Akzo (see above) in the production of Twaron, a patent war ensued.How Kevlar® works: a simple introduction. Explainthatstuff.com (2009-12-07). Retrieved on 2012-05-26.
Kevlar (poly paraphenylene terephthalamide) production is expensive because of the difficulties arising from using concentrated sulfuric acid, needed to keep the water-insoluble polymer in solution during its synthesis and spinning.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
Several grades of Kevlar are available:
The ultraviolet component of sunlight degrades and decomposes Kevlar, a problem known as UV degradation, and so it is rarely used outdoors without protection against sunlight.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]

==Structure and properties==

When Kevlar is spun, the resulting fiber has a tensile strength of about 3,620 MPa,[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Quintanilla | first1 = J. | year = 1990 | title = Microstructure and properties of random heterogeneous materials : a review of theoretical results | url = | journal = Polymer engineering and science | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 559–585 [/tpl] and a relative density of 1.44.  The polymer owes its high strength to the many inter-chain bonds. These inter-molecular hydrogen bonds form between the carbonyl groups and NH centers.  Additional strength is derived from aromatic stacking interactions between adjacent strands. These interactions have a greater influence on Kevlar than the van der Waals interactions and chain length that typically influence the properties of other synthetic polymers and fibers such as Dyneema. The presence of salts and certain other impurities, especially calcium, could interfere with the strand interactions and caution is used to avoid inclusion in its production. Kevlar's structure consists of relatively rigid molecules which tend to form mostly planar sheet-like structures rather like silk protein.Michael C. Petty, Molecular electronics: from principles to practice, John Wiley & Sons, 2007, p. 310

==Thermal properties==

Kevlar maintains its strength and resilience down to cryogenic temperatures (−196 °C); in fact, it is slightly stronger at low temperatures. At higher temperatures the tensile strength is immediately reduced by about 10–20%, and after some hours the strength progressively reduces further. For example at 160 °C (320 °F) about 10% reduction in strength occurs after 500 hours. At 260 °C (500 °F) 50% strength reduction occurs after 70 hours.KEVLAR Technical Guide. dupont.com.

==Applications==

===Protection===

====Cryogenics====

Kevlar is often used in the field of cryogenics for its low thermal conductivity and high strength relative to other materials for suspension purposes. Most often used to suspend a paramagnetic salt enclosure from a superconducting magnet mandrel in order to minimize any heat leaks to the paramagnetic material. It is also used as a thermal standoff or structural support where low heat leaks are desired.

====Armor====

Kevlar is a well-known component of personal armor such as combat helmets, ballistic face masks, and ballistic vests. The PASGT helmet and vest used by United States military forces since the 1980s both have Kevlar as a key component, as do their replacements. Other military uses include bulletproof facemasks used by sentries and spall liners used to protect the crews of armoured fighting vehicles.  Even Nimitz-class aircraft carriers include Kevlar armor around vital spaces.  Related civilian applications include Emergency Service's protection gear if it involves high heat (e.g., tackling a fire), and Kevlar body armor such as vests for police officers, security, and SWAT.Body Armor Made with Kevlar.

Kevlar based protective gear is often considerably lighter and thinner than equivalent gear made of more traditional materials.

===Sports equipment===

It is used as an inner lining for some bicycle tires to prevent punctures. In table tennis, plies of Kevlar are added to custom ply blades, or paddles, in order to increase bounce and reduce weight. It is used for motorcycle safety clothing, especially in the areas featuring padding such as shoulders and elbows.
In Kyudo or Japanese archery, it may be used as an alternative to more expensive hemp for bow strings. It is one of the main materials used for paraglider suspension lines.[tpl]citation|last=Pagen|first=Dennis|title=Paragliding Flight: Walking on Air|year=1990|publisher=Pagen Books|isbn=0-936310-09-X|page=9[/tpl]
In fencing it is used in the protective jackets, breeches, plastrons and the bib of the masks.
Tennis racquets are often strung with Kevlar.
It is even used in sails for high performance racing boats.
It is increasingly being used in the "peto", the padded covering which protects the picadors' horses in the bullring.

====Shoes====

With advancements in technology, Nike used Kevlar in shoes for the first time. It launched the Elite II Series[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl], with enhancements to its earlier version of basketball shoes by using Kevlar in the anterior as well as the shoe laces. This was done to decrease the elasticity of the tip of the shoe in contrast to nylon used conventionally as Kevlar expanded by about 1% against nylon which expanded by about 30%. Shoes in this range included LeBron, HyperDunk and Zoom Kobe VII. However these shoes were launched at a price range much higher than average cost of basketball shoes.
It was also used as speed control patches for certain Soap Shoes models.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] and the laces for the adidas F50 adiZero Prime football boot.

====Drumheads====

Kevlar is sometimes used as a material on marching snare drums. It allows for an extremely high amount of tension, resulting in a cleaner sound. There is usually a resin poured onto the Kevlar to make the head airtight, and a nylon top layer to provide a flat striking surface. This is one of the primary types of marching snare drum heads. Remo's "Falam Slam" Patch is made with Kevlar and is used to reinforce bass drum heads where the beater strikes.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]

====Woodwind reeds====

Kevlar is used in the woodwind reeds of Fibracell. The material of these reeds is a composite of aerospace materials designed to duplicate the way nature constructs cane reed. Very stiff but sound absorbing Kevlar fibers are suspended in a lightweight resin formulation.[tpl]cite web|title=FibraCell Website|url=http://www.fibracelldirect.com/[/tpl]

===Other uses===

====Fire dancing====

Wicks for fire dancing props are made of composite materials with Kevlar in them. Kevlar by itself does not absorb fuel very well, so it is blended with other materials such as fiberglass or cotton. Kevlar's high heat resistance allows the wicks to be reused many times.

====Frying pans====

Kevlar is sometimes used as a substitute for Teflon in some non-stick frying pans.M.Rubinstein, R.H.Colby, Polymer Physics, Oxford University Press, p337

====Rope, cable, sheath====

The fiber is used in woven rope and in cable, where the fibers are kept parallel within a polyethylene sleeve. The cables have been used in suspension bridges such as the bridge at Aberfeldy in Scotland. They have also been used to stabilize cracking concrete cooling towers by circumferential application followed by tensioning to close the cracks. Kevlar is widely used as a protective outer sheath for optical fiber cable, as its strength protects the cable from damage and kinking. When used in this application it is commonly known by the trademarked name Parafil.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]

====Electricity generation====

Kevlar was used by scientists at Georgia Institute of Technology as a base textile for an experiment in electricity-producing clothing.  This was done by weaving zinc oxide nanowires into the fabric. If successful, the new fabric would generate about 80 milliwatts per square meter.Fabric Produces Electricity As You Wear It. Scientific American (2008-02-22). Retrieved on 2012-05-26.

====Building construction====

A retractable roof of over 60,000 square feet (5,575 square metres) of Kevlar was a key part of the design of Montreal's Olympic stadium for the 1976 Summer Olympics. It was spectacularly unsuccessful, as it was completed ten years late and replaced just ten years later in May 1998 after a series of problems.[tpl]Structurae|id=s0000742|title=Roof of the Montreal Olympic Stadium[/tpl]Clem's Baseball ~ Olympic Stadium.

====Expansion joints and hoses====

Kevlar can be found as a reinforcing layer in rubber bellows expansion joints and rubber hoses, for use in high temperature applications, and for its high strength. It is also found as a braid layer used on the outside of hose assemblies, to add protection against sharp objects.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]

====Particle physics====

A thin Kevlar window has been used by the NA48 experiment at CERN to separate a vacuum vessel from a vessel at nearly atmospheric pressure, both 192 cm in diameter. The window has provided vacuum tightness combined with reasonably small amount of material (only 0.3% to 0.4% of radiation length).[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
