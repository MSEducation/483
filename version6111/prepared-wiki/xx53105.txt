[[Acrosome]]

The acrosome is an organelle that develops over the anterior half of the head in the spermatozoa (sperm cells) of many animals. It is a cap-like structure derived from the Golgi apparatus. Acrosome formation is completed during testicular maturation. In Eutherian mammals the acrosome contains digestive enzymes (including hyaluronidase and acrosin).[tpl]cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |title=acrosome definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |accessdate=2007-08-15 |format= |work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwDPQanq|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes[/tpl] These enzymes break down the outer membrane of the ovum, called the zona pellucida, allowing the haploid nucleus in the sperm cell to join with the haploid nucleus in the ovum.  
This shedding of the acrosome, or acrosome reaction, can be stimulated in vitro by substances a sperm cell may encounter naturally such as progesterone or follicular fluid, as well as the more commonly used calcium ionophore A23187.  This can be done to serve as a positive control when assessing the acrosome reaction of a sperm sample by flow cytometry[tpl]cite journal |author=Miyazaki R, Fukuda M, Takeuchi H, Itoh S, Takada M |title=Flow cytometry to evaluate acrosome-reacted sperm |journal=Arch.

This is usually done after staining with a fluoresceinated lectin such as FITC-PNA, FITC-PSA, FITC-ConA, or fluoresceinated antibody such as FITC-CD46.[tpl]cite journal |author=Carver-Ward JA, Moran-Verbeek IM, Hollanders JM |title=Comparative flow cytometric analysis of the human sperm acrosome reaction using CD46 antibody and lectins |journal=J.

In the case of globozoospermia (sperm with round heads), the Golgi apparatus is not transformed into the acrosome, causing male infertility.[tpl]cite book |author=Hermann Behre; Eberhard Nieschlag |title=Andrology : Male Reproductive Health and Dysfunction |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2000 |page=155 |isbn=3-540-67224-9 [/tpl]
