Hoveton [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|f|t|ən[/tpl] is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It is located within the Norfolk Broads, and immediately across the River Bure from the village of Wroxham. Whilst Hoveton is north of the river, Wroxham is south; but many people refer to the whole settlement as "Wroxham".Ordnance Survey (2005). OS Explorer Map OL40 - The Broads. ISBN 0-319-23769-9.

==Transport==

Hoveton is served by Hoveton and Wroxham railway station, which is on the Bittern Line from Norwich to Cromer and Sheringham, and which is adjacent to the terminus of the narrow-gauge Bure Valley Railway to Aylsham. The station was originally intended to be on the Wroxham side of the river, but a change of plan resulted in it being sited in Hoveton; however, it was misleadingly named "Wroxham Station" for many years. It was changed to "Hoveton and Wroxham" in the early 1980s. Locals and regular visitors  still refer to it by its old name, which can lead to confusion when purchasing a ticket in other parts of the country, and can result in being sold a ticket to Wrexham, North Wales.
