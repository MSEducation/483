Ferguson's Gang, formed in 1927, was an anonymous and somewhat enigmatic group that raised funds for the National Trust during the period from 1930 until 1947.
The inner-circle of the group were five young women,[tpl]cite book|last=Hutton-North|first=Anna|title=Ferguson's Gang - The Maidens behind the Masks|year=2013|publisher=Lulu Inc|isbn=978-1-291-48453-3[/tpl] who hid their identities behind masks, unusual pseudonyms, and mock-Cockney communiques.[tpl]cite news | first = Sue | last = Herdman | title = The Cloaked Crusaders | work = The National Trust Magazine | date = Spring 2008 | pages = 24–27 | publisher = The National Trust[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Waterson |first=Merlin |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The National Trust: The First Hundred Years |year=1994 |publisher=National Trust (Enterprises) Ltd, BCA and BBC Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-563-37066-6[/tpl]
The gang was influenced by Clough Williams-Ellis's publication England and the Octopus, which denounced insensitive building and ugly development. They determined to save what they could. Their donations enabled the purchase of Shalford Mill, in Surrey, and Newtown Old Town Hall, on the Isle of Wight. They also funded the purchase of stretches of the coastline of Cornwall, Priory Cottages at Steventon in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), and supported appeals for money to purchase land in Derbyshire, the Lake District, Devon and Wiltshire. In total they raised the sum of £4,500, the equivalent to half a million pounds in today's money.
As an example of their methods, in 1933 a fully masked Red Biddy deposited a large sack of Victorian coins to the value of £100 on the Trust secretary's desk. In 1935, one of the 'gang' was interviewed by the BBC, and turned up at Broadcasting House wearing a mask.
In the words of the group's leader Bill Stickers:http://fergusonsgang.co.uk/introducing-the-gang.html

Members of Ferguson's Gang included Bill Stickers, Sister Agatha, Red Biddy, Erb the Smasher, Kate O'Brien The Nark, Silent O'Moyle, See Mee Run, Gerry Moham, Black Maria, and the Lord Beershop of the Gladstone Islands & Mercator's Projection. When the Oxbridge Sanskrit scholar and adopted Cornish bard Margaret Steuart Pollard died at the age of 93 in 1996, her obituaries revealed that she had been Bill Stickers.[tpl]cite news | first = Ann Trevenen | last = Jenkin | title = Obituary: Margaret Pollard |  date = 1996-12-07 | work = The Independent (London) | accessdate = 2009-11-01 | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituarymargaret-pollard-1313345.html[/tpl]
In 2013 the author Anna Hutton-North completed an extensive research programme to uncover the women behind the pseudonyms. Her full history of the Gang is included in Ferguson's Gang: The Maidens behind the Masks.[tpl]cite web|last=Hutton-North|first=Anna|title=Ferguson's Gang - the history|url=http://www.fergusonsgang.co.uk|publisher=Lulu Inc|accessdate=8 October 2013[/tpl]
