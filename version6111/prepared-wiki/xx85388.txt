[[Glideascope]]

CATEGORIES: British electronic musicians

Glideascope is a London based downtempo/trip-hop artist and producer, who has pioneered a direction in the genre of downtempo music which he terms 'Audio Cinematography'.  With heavy use of cinematic undertones, blissful melodies and lo-fi beats.
November 2003 witnessed the debut release from Glideascope titled ‘With Strings Attached’. This downtempo EP - the first instalment from Glideascope – was licensed by MTV for their U.S. based documentary MADE.  The EP’s corresponding success sealed a distribution and publishing deal with Jet Star early in 2005.
In 2006 Glideascope was the only UK artist selected to appear as a Buzz Band artist and showcased material at the MIDEM music conference in Cannes, after recording sessions with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. 
The debut album titled ‘Audio Cinematography’, was recorded over a two-year period. It promotes emotive electronica, live orchestral strings and world music landscapes whilst plunging into the depth-charged dub reggae of old.
