==Life and career==

Green was born in Fort Lee, New Jersey. She grew up in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey and attended Pascack Hills High School in Montvale, New Jersey.Staff. "AT THE MOVIES FOR A FIRST-TIME STAR, LIFE IS SUNNY SIDE UP", The Philadelphia Inquirer, March 30, 1986. Accessed September 18, 2011. "During the summer of 1984, would-be movie actress Kerri Green, now 19, was frying up poultry parts at the local Roy's near her Woodcliff Lake, N.J., home and commuting into New York for auditions."Joyner, Will. "THE SUBTLE SHADE OF KERRI GREEN", The Record (Bergen County), March 28, 1986. "In the fall of 1984, though, a successful audition for Steven Spielberg's The Goonies allowed Kerri to stop speculating and to steal away from her senior year at Pascack Hills High School." 
She performed as a young teen in several movies including Summer Rental (1985), which starred John Candy. Her big break came in the 1985 film The Goonies, in which she played cheerleader-turned-adventurer Andrea "Andy" Carmichael. She gained more critical acclaim for her performance in Lucas (1986). However, her next film, Three for the Road (1987), which featured Charlie Sheen and Alan Ruck, did not fare as well. She performed in an independent film called Blue Flame and appeared in two episodes of the television sitcom Mad About You as Paul's secretary. She then took a break from acting to study art at Vassar College, where she was roommates with Marisa Tomei's brother, Adam, and with Bioshock developer Ken Levine.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Suellentrop |first1=Chris |date=6 December 2012 |title=Why BioShock Infinite’s Creator Won’t Settle for Success |journal=Wired |volume=21 |issue=1 |publisher=Condé Nast |url=http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/12/ff_bioshock/all/ |accessdate=8 April 2013[/tpl]
