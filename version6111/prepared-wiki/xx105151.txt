[[Spidron]]

CATEGORIES: Geometric shapes

In geometry, a spidron is a continuous flat geometric figure composed entirely of triangles, where, for every pair of joining triangles, each has a leg of the other as one of its legs, and neither has any point inside the interior of the other.  A deformed spidron is a three-dimensional figure sharing the other properties of a specific spidron, as if that spidron were drawn on paper, cut out in a single piece, and folded along a number of legs. 

==Origin and Development==

It was first modelled in 1979 by Dániel Erdély, as a homework presented to Ernő Rubik, for Rubik's design class, at the Hungarian University of Arts and Design (now: Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design). Also Dániel Erdély gave the name Spidron to it, when he discovered it in the early 70s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20061021/bob11.asp|title=Swirling Seas, Crystal Balls|publisher=ScienceNews.org|accessdate=2007-02-14| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070228210951/http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20061021/bob11.asp| archivedate = February 28, 2007[/tpl]  The name originates from the English names of spider and spiral, because the shape is reminiscent of a spider web.
In his initial work Erdély started with a Hexagon. He combined every corner with the after-next one. In his mathematical analysis of Spidrons Stefan Stenzhorn demonstrated that it is possible to create a Spidron with every regular Polygon greater than four. Furthermore you can vary the number of points to the next combination. Stefan Stenzhorn reasoned that after all the initial Hexagon-Spidron is just the special case of a general Spidron. http://stefanstenzhorn.com/Spidrons.

In a two-dimensional plane a tessellation with Hexagon-Spidrons is possible. The form is known from many works by M.C. Escher, who devoted himself to such bodies of high symmetry. Due to their symmetry Spidrons are also an interesting object for mathematicians. 
The spidrons can appear in a very large number of versions, and the different formations make possible the development of a great variety of plane, spatial and mobile applications. These developments are suitable to perform aesthetic and practical functions that are defined in advance by the consciously selected arrangements of all the possible characteristics of symmetry. The spidron system is under the protection of several know-how and industrial pattern patents. It was awarded a gold medal at the exhibition Genius Europe in 2005. It has been presented in a number of art magazines, conferences and international exhibitions. During the last two years it has also appeared, in several versions, as a public area work. Since Spidron-system is the personal work by Dániel Erdély but in the development of the individual formations he worked together with several Hungarian, Dutch, Canadian and American colleagues, the exhibition is a collective product in a sense, several works and developments are a result of an international team-work.
Many spidrons are designed to correspond to deformed spidrons that are also polyhedra. 

==Practical Use==

Considering the use of Spidrons Daniel Erdély enumerated several possible applications:
"It has been raised repeatedly that several layers of spidron reliefs could be used as shock dampers or crumple zones in
vehicles. Its space-filling properties make it suitable for the construction of building blocks or toys.
The surface could be used to create an adjustable acoustic wall or a system of solar cells that follow
the sun in a simple manner. Various folding buildings and static structures could also be developed on
the basis of my geometric investigation which may have utility in space travel." http://matserv.pmmf.hu/hajtas/docs/2/Spidron_EN.pdf. Concept of Spidron System by Daniel Erdély.
