[[1980 Atlantic hurricane season]]

CATEGORIES: 1980 Atlantic hurricane season, Articles which contain graphical timelines

The 1980 Atlantic hurricane season was tied with 1932, 1969, and 1994 for most named storms in Atlantic Ocean during the month of November – only to be surpassed in 2001 and 2005. The season officially began on June 1, 1980, and lasted until November 30, 1980. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean.
The season was fairly active, with fifteen tropical cyclones forming. It was the first time since the 1971 season that there were no active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin during the month of June. The season was neutral, having neither an El Niño nor a La Niña. Three tropical cyclones during in the Atlantic Ocean in 1980 were notable. Hurricane Allen was then the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record and also devastated portions of the Caribbean Sea, Mexico, and the United States. Tropical Storm Hermine caused significant flooding in Mexico, which resulted in at least 38 fatalities. Hurricane Jeanne was one of only four tropical cyclones at hurricane intensity to enter the Gulf of Mexico and not make landfall.

==Season summary==

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wTBfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N08NAAAAIBAJ&pg=6944,1168166&dq=hurricane+season&hl=en|title=Hurricane season opening Sunday|author=Staff Writer|date=May 30, 1980|agency=United Press International|publisher=The Bonham Daily Favorite|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] though the first tropical depression did not develop until July 17. During the season, 15 tropical depressions formed. Eight of the depressions attained tropical storm status, and eight of these attained hurricane status. Two of the hurricanes further strengthened to become major hurricanes. Only Allen made landfall at hurricane strength during the season, although Hurricane Charley and tropical storms Danielle and Hermine also caused damage and fatalities. Those three cyclones collectively caused 337 deaths and $1.5 billion (1980 USD) in damage. The last storm of the season, Hurricane Karl, dissipated on November 27, only three days before the official end date of November 30.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3MYyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=72cEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6775,371357&dq=hurricane+season&hl=en|title=Weather – Local, National, International|author=Staff Writer|date=December 2, 1980|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl]
The 1980 Atlantic hurricane season had a rather slow beginning, with only one tropical depression developing prior to the month of August. In contrast, August was an active month, with five tropical cyclones forming, three of which became hurricanes. During that month, Hurricane Allen became the earliest known Category 5 hurricane on August 5, a record later broken by only Hurricane Emily on July 16, 2005.[tpl]cite web|author=James L. Franklin & Daniel P.

Tropical cyclogenesis abruptly halted in October, with only Hurricane Ivan developing in that month. However, the month of November was considered to be very active, with three storms forming during that month. Two of the systems became named storms, a record that was tied with 1932, 1969, and 1994, but later surpassed when three tropical storms existed in the Atlantic in November 2001 and November 2005.
The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 149,[tpl]cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=March 2011|title=Atlantic basin Comparison of Original and Revised HURDAT|accessdate=July 23, 2011|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Comparison_of_Original_and_Revised_HURDAT_mar11.html[/tpl] which is classified as "above normal".[tpl]cite web|author=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|url=http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/background_information.shtml|title=Background information: the North Atlantic Hurricane Season|date=May 27, 2010|publisher=Climate Prediction Center|accessdate=March 30, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110510081844/http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/background_information.shtml| archivedate= 10 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength.
