[[Vanderbilt Trophy]]

CATEGORIES: North American Bridge Championships

The trophy is awarded for the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams national bridge championship held at the spring American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) North American Bridge Championship (NABC).
The Vanderbilt is a knock-out team event. The event typically lasts seven days with each day being a round consisting of two sessions of 32 boards. The event is open and seeded.

==History==

The history of the prestigious contest began in 1928 when the inventor of modern contract bridge, Harold S. Vanderbilt, put the trophy bearing his name into play. The winners list is a who’s who of bridge.
The trophy was donated in 1928 by Harold S. Vanderbilt, who won the event in 1932 and 1940. Winners receive replicas of the trophy - a practice initiated by Vanderbilt from the first running of the event and perpetuated by a $100,000 trust fund administered by ACBL under the terms of Vanderbilt’s will. On display at ACBL Headquarters in Horn Lake, Mississippi are replicas donated by the families of Caroline Taylor, who won the Vanderbilt in 1928, and Helen Sobel Smith, a Vanderbilt winner in 1944 and 1945.
The Vanderbilt was contested annually in New York—as a separate championship—until 1958 when it became part of the spring North American Bridge Championships.
