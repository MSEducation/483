James J. Jordan, Jr. (August 3, 1930 â€“ February 4, 2004) was an American ad-man and sloganeer.
He is best known for his work at the BBDO advertising agency, coining such slogans as "Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch!", "Wisk beats ring around the collar", and "Shaefer is the one beer to have when you're having more than one."  As Creative Director at BBDO, he oversaw major campaigns for Pepsi, Burger King ("Have it Your Way"), Pillsbury and Campbell Soup.  In 1976, he left BBDO to start his own agency, James Jordan, Inc.   He later merged his agency with Case & Krone to form Jordan, Case and McGrath, a full-service agency that grew during the 1980s to $500 million in billings.  (JCM eventually became JMC&T--Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor.)   Other slogans penned by Jordan include the following: "Delta is ready when you are." "You're not fully clean unless your Zest-fully clean!"  "Soup so Chunky, you'll be tempted to use a fork.  But use a spoon--you'll want to get every drop."  "If they could just stay little 'til their Carter's wear out."  "Quaker Oats.  It's the right thing to do."  
A graduate of Amherst College, he would later serve on its board of trustees. He died of a heart attack while snorkeling in the Virgin Islands, aged 73. He was survived by his wife of 46 years, the former Mary Helen Cronin, and his seven children. He also currently has 17 grandchildren. He was an avid baseball fan who attended as many of his grandchildren's sports games as possible.
