The Italian cheese Bra originates from the town of Bra in Cuneo in the region of Piemonte.
Production of Bra may take place all year, but it may only legally take place within the province of Cuneo, however, aging may also take place in Villafranca, in Turin. The cheese may use either unpasteurized or pasteurized milk, often entirely cow's milk, but goat's or sheep's milk may be added in small amounts. It may be served as a soft or hard cheese, depending on the length of aging, from at least forty five days for soft cheese, from six months for hard cheese.
Bra has PDO status under European Law.
