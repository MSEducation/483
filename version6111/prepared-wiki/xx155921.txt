[[Paraneoplastic syndrome]]

CATEGORIES: Paraneoplastic syndromes, Immune system disorders

A paraneoplastic syndrome is a disease or symptom that is the consequence of cancer in the body but, unlike mass effect, is not due to the local presence of cancer cells.Paraneoplastic Syndromes, 2011, Darnell & Posner These phenomena are mediated by humoral factors (by hormones or cytokines) excreted by tumor cells or by an immune response against the tumor. Paraneoplastic syndromes are typical among middle aged to older patients, and they most commonly present with cancers of the lung, breast, ovaries or lymphatic system (a lymphoma).NINDS Paraneoplastic Syndromes Information Page National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Sometimes the symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes show before the diagnosis of a malignancy, which has been hypothesized to relate to the disease pathogenesis.  In this paradigm, tumor cells express tissue-restricted antigens (such as neuronal proteins), triggering an anti-tumor immune response which may be partially or, rarely, completely effective[tpl]cite |journal=Lancet |author=Darnell,R.B., DeAngelis,L.M. |title=Regression of small-cell lung carcinoma in patients with paraneoplastic neuronal antibodies |volume=341|issue=8836 |pages=21–22 |year=1993 |pmid= 8093269[/tpl] in suppressing tumor growth and symptoms.[tpl]cite |journal=Current Opinion in Immunology |author=Roberts,W.K., Darnell,R.B. |title=Neuroimmunology of the paraneoplastic neurological degenerations |volume=16|issue=5 |pages=616–622 |year=2004 |pmid= 15342008 |doi=10.1016/j.coi.2004.07.009[/tpl][tpl]cite |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |author=Albert,M.A., Darnell,R.B. |title=Paraneoplastic neurological degenerations: keys to tumour immunity |volume=4|issue=1 |pages=36–44 |year=2004 |pmid= 14708025[/tpl]  Patients then come to clinical attention when this tumor immune response breaks immune tolerance and begins to attack the normal tissue expressing that (e.g. neuronal) protein.

==Classification==

Paraneoplastic syndromes can be divided into four main categories: Endocrine, neurological, mucocutaneous and hematological paraneoplastic syndromes, as well as others that may not fit into any of the above categories:

==Neurological==

A particularly devastating form of paraneoplastic syndromes is a group of disorders classified as paraneoplastic neurological disorders (PNDs).[tpl]cite journal |author=Rees JH |title=PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES: WHEN TO SUSPECT, HOW TO CONFIRM, AND HOW TO MANAGE |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. |volume=75 Suppl 2 |issue= Suppl 2|pages=ii43–50 |year=2004 |pmid=15146039 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2004.040378 |pmc=1765657[/tpl] These paraneoplastic disorders affect the central or peripheral nervous system; some are degenerative,[tpl]cite journal |author=Darnell RB, Posner JB |title=Paraneoplastic syndromes affecting the nervous system |journal=Semin Oncol |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=270–98 |year=2006 |pmid= 16769417 |doi=10.1053/j.seminoncol.2006.03.008[/tpl] though others (such as LEMS) may improve with treatment of the condition or the tumour. Symptoms of paraneoplastic neurological disorders may include ataxia (difficulty with walking and balance), dizziness, nystagmus (rapid uncontrolled eye movements), difficulty swallowing, loss of muscle tone, loss of fine motor coordination, slurred speech, memory loss, vision problems, sleep disturbances, dementia, seizures, sensory loss in the limbs. 
The most common cancers associated with paraneoplastic neurological disorders are breast, ovarian and lung cancer, but many other cancers can produce paraneoplastic symptoms as well.
