Locomotive 'Pioneer' 1001 (former 394X) was two-cylinder, simple, non-condensing, coal-fired, 0-6-0 Saddle Tank locomotive for the New South Wales Government Railways built in 1861 by Manning Wardle.

==Service==

Locomotive 1001 was originally on railway construction work under the name "Pioneer" by its owners, Petro, Brassey and Betts and was sold to NSWGR in June 1864 and given the number 9N. In 1889 it was renumbered 394 and hired out to various private lines and later sold in 1909. In 1917 it found its way back into railway fold with the transfer of railway construction from the Public Works Department and continued in this work till 1925 when it was laid aside and eventually scrapped in 1929 after a life of 68 years.
It is a significant locomotive in the history of the New South Wales railways in that it demonstrated the usefulness of small 6 coupled tank engines in a variety of roles, even though it was itself somewhat underpowered for many of the tasks that came its way.ARHS Bulletin April 2004, Ron Madden
