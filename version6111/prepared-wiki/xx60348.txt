He also hosted the original version of the talent show Star Search from 1983 to 1995. He co-hosted TV's Bloopers & Practical Jokes with Dick Clark from 1982 to 1998. He also presented sweepstakes for the direct marketing company American Family Publishers (not, as is commonly believed, its main rival Publishers Clearing House)."Setting the Record Straight on Ed McMahon," Publishers Clearing House official blog, by Dave Sayer, March 15, 2009.

McMahon annually co-hosted the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon. He performed in numerous television commercials, most notably for Budweiser. In the 1970s and 1980s, he anchored the team of NBC personalities conducting the network's coverage of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. McMahon appeared in several films, including The Incident, Fun With Dick and Jane, Full Moon High, and Butterfly, as well as briefly in the film version of Bewitched. According to Entertainment Weekly, McMahon is considered one of the greatest "sidekicks".Ben Schott, Schott's Mischellany Calendar 2009 (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008), March 21.

==Early years==

McMahon was born in Detroit, Michigan to Edward Leo Peter McMahon, Sr. a fund-raiser and entertainer, and his wife Eleanor (Russell) McMahon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/55/Ed-McMahon.html|title=Ed McMahon Biography (1923-2009)[/tpl] He was raised in Lowell, Massachusetts. McMahon began his career as a bingo caller in Maine when he was fifteen.
Prior to this, he worked as a carnival barker for three years in Mexico, Maine. He put himself through college as a pitchman for vegetable slicers on the Atlantic City boardwalk. His first broadcasting job was at WLLH-AM in his native Lowell and he began his television career in Philadelphia at WCAU-TV.

===Military service===

McMahon hoped to become a United States Marine Corps fighter pilot.  Prior to the US entry into World War II, however, both the Army and Navy required two years of college for their pilots program. McMahon enrolled into classes at Boston College and studied there from 1940-41. After Pearl Harbor was attacked, the college requirement was dropped, and McMahon immediately applied for Marine flight training.  His primary flight training was in Dallas, followed by fighter training in Pensacola, where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific fleet in 1945. However, his orders were canceled after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki forcing Japan's surrender.
As an officer in the reserves, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. This time, he flew the OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog), an unarmed single-engine spotter plane. He functioned as an artillery spotter for the Marine batteries on the ground and as a forward controller for the Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he stayed with the Marines, as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a colonel.  In 1982 he received a state commission as a brigadier general in the California Air National Guard, an honorific awarded to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.Deseret News, "It's General Ed", February 24, 1982Jerry Buck, Associated Press, Youngstown Vindicator, "Shows Keep McMahon Busy Depite Vows to 'Slow Down'", January 15, 1984

===The Catholic University of America===

After World War II, McMahon studied at The Catholic University of America  under the GI Bill and  graduated in 1949.  He majored in speech and drama while studying under the Rev. Gilbert Hartke and was a member of Phi Kappa Theta fraternity. After graduation, McMahon led the effort to raise funds for a theater to be named for Hartke, and attended its dedication in 1970 with Helen Hayes and Sidney Poitier.
While working as Johnny Carson's sidekick during The Tonight Show, McMahon served as the president of the national alumni association from 1967-1971 and would often return to campus, especially for homecoming.  During the University's centennial celebration in 1987, McMahon and comedian Bob Newhart performed.  He received an honorary Doctor of Communication Arts in 1988.  "I owe so much to CU," McMahon once said. "That's where my career got its start."
Today, the Ed McMahon Endowed Scholarship helps outstanding students and provides scholarship assistance to juniors and seniors who are pursuing a bachelor's degree in either the Department of Drama or the Department of Media Studies within the School of Arts and Sciences.

==Entertainment career==

===The Tonight Show===

McMahon and Johnny Carson first worked together as announcer and host on the daytime game show Who Do You Trust? (1957–1962). McMahon and Carson left the show to join The Tonight Show in 1962. He describes what happened when the pair first met, the whole meeting being "... about as exciting as watching a traffic light change".Lasting Tribute online obituary.[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] For almost 30 years, McMahon introduced the The Tonight Show with a drawn-out "Heeere's Johnny!" His booming voice and constant laughter alongside the "King of Late Night" earned McMahon the nickname the "Human Laugh Track" and "Toymaker to the King". As part of the introductory patter to The Tonight Show, McMahon would state his name out loud, pronouncing it as [tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɨ|k|ˈ|m|eɪ|.|ən[/tpl], but neither long-time cohort Johnny Carson nor anyone else who interviewed him ever seemed to pick up on that subtlety, usually pronouncing his name [tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɨ|k|ˈ|m|æ|n[/tpl].[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
The extroverted McMahon served as a counter to the notoriously shy Carson. Nonetheless, McMahon once told an interviewer that after his many decades as an emcee, he would still get "butterflies" in his stomach every time he would walk onto a stage, and would use that nervousness as a source of energy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
His famous opening line to each show "Heeere's Johnny!" was used in the 1980 Horror film The Shining by the character Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson) as he attacks his wife and child with an axe.

===Star Search===

He was also host of the successful weekly syndicated series Star Search, which began in 1983 and helped launch the careers of numerous actors, singers, choreographers, and comedians. He stayed with the show until it ended in 1995, and in 2003, he made a cameo appearance on the revival of the CBS show, hosted by his successor, Arsenio Hall.

===Other roles===

McMahon was the co-host of the long-running annual Labor Day weekend MDA Jerry Lewis Telethon. His 41st and last appearance was in 2008, making him second only to Lewis himself in number of appearances.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mda.org/news/090623mcmahon.html|title=Longtime MDA Telethon Anchor Ed McMahon Dies|date=2009-06-23[/tpl] McMahon and Dick Clark hosted the television series (and later special broadcasts of) TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes on NBC from 1982–98, when Clark decided to move the production of the series to ABC.

From 1965 to 1969, McMahon was communicator (host) of the Saturday afternoon segment of Monitor, the weekend news, features and entertainment magazine on NBC Radio. McMahon had a supporting role in the original 1970's version of the movie "Fun With Dick & Jane" and played himself in Steven Spielberg's 1986 Amazing Stories Season 1: Episode 10  ("Remote Control Man").[tpl]cite web|title=Internet Movie Data Base|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0511113/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm#cast|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=14 May 2013[/tpl]

He also appeared in the feature documentary film, Pitch People, the first motion picture to take an in-depth look at the history and evolution of pitching products to the public. In the early 2000s, McMahon made a series of Neighborhood Watch public service announcements parodying the surprise appearances to contest winners that he was supposedly known for. (In fact, it is not clear whether the company McMahon fronted, American Family Publishers, regularly performed such unannounced visits, as opposed to Publishers Clearing House and its oft-promoted "prize patrol".)
Towards the end of the decade, McMahon took on other endorsement roles, playing a rapper for a FreeCreditReport.com commercial[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/09/25/people.ed.mcmahon.ap|title=Ed McMahon turns gangsta rapper|publisher=CNN|date=2008-09-25|accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] and in a Cash4Gold commercial alongside MC Hammer.

===Financial problems===

In June 2008, it was announced that McMahon was $644,000 behind on payments on $4.8 million in mortgage loans and was fighting to avoid foreclosure on his multimillion-dollar Beverly Hills home."Ed McMahon fighting foreclosure on his Beverly Hills home however holds deposits in offshore accounts unaccounted for." AP News, accessed June 4, 2008. McMahon was also sued by Citibank for $180,000. McMahon appeared on Larry King Live on June 5, 2008 with his wife to talk about this situation. In the interview, McMahon's wife Pam said that people assumed that the McMahons had so much money because of his celebrity status. Pamela McMahon also commented that they do not have "millions" of dollars.Ed McMahon explains his mortgage mess, CNN.com, June 6, 2008. On July 30, 2008, McMahon's financial status suffered another blow. According to Reuters, McMahon failed to pay divorce attorney Norman Solovay $275,168, according to a lawsuit filed in the Manhattan federal court. McMahon and his wife, Pamela, hired Solovay to represent Linda Schmerge, his daughter from another relationship, in a "matrimonial matter," said Solovay's lawyer, Michael Shanker.[tpl]cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUKN3047452120080731|title=Ed McMahon sued over legal bills|date=July 30, 2008 | work=Reuters | first=Edith | last=Honan[/tpl]
On August 14, 2008, real estate mogul Donald Trump announced that he would purchase McMahon's home from Countrywide Financial and lease it to McMahon, so the home would not be foreclosed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/classified/realestate/la-hmw-hotpropmcmahon14-2008aug14,0,6229599.story|title=Donald Trump to buy Ed McMahon’s house|date=14 August 2008|author=Brenoff, Ann | work=The Los Angeles Times[/tpl] McMahon agreed instead to a deal with a private buyer for his hilltop home, said Howard Bragman, McMahon's former spokesman. Bragman declined to name the buyer or the selling price, but he said it is not Trump. "For Mr. Trump, this acquisition was not business-related, but, as he has stated, was meant to help out an American icon," said Michael Cohen, special counsel to Trump. "If another buyer should emerge who will create the benefit Mr. Trump sought for Ed McMahon, then he is clearly pleased." In early September, after the second buyer's offer fell through, Trump renewed his offer to purchase the home.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/26528934|title=Donald Trump 'Still Here To Help' Ed McMahon Stay In House|date=3 September 2008|author=Wells, Jane[/tpl]

===Health problems===

On April 20, 2002, McMahon sued his insurance company for more than $20 million, alleging that he was sickened by toxic mold that spread through his Beverly Hills house after contractors failed to properly clean up water damage from a broken pipe. McMahon and his wife, Pamela, became ill from the mold, as did members of their household staff, according to the Los Angeles County Superior Court suit. The McMahons also blame the mold for the death of the family dog, Muffin. Their suit, the latest of many in recent years over toxic mold, was filed against American Equity Insurance Co., a pair of insurance adjusters and several environmental cleanup contractors. It seeks monetary damages for alleged breach of contract, negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress. A spokeswoman for the insurance company declined to comment. On March 21, 2003, the long battle ended with McMahon reaping $7 million from what was later discovered to be several companies who were negligent for allowing mold into his home. Their dog's death was confirmed to be caused by mold.
McMahon was injured in 2007 in a fall and, in March 2008, it was announced he was recovering from a broken neck and two subsequent surgeries. He later sued Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and two doctors claiming fraud, battery, elder abuse, and emotional distress, and accused them of discharging him with a broken neck after his fall in 2007 and later botching two neck surgeries. On February 27, 2009 it was reported that McMahon had been in an undisclosed Los Angeles hospital (later confirmed as Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center) for almost a month. He was listed in serious condition and was in the intensive care unit. His publicist told reporters that he was admitted for pneumonia at the time, but could not confirm nor deny reports that McMahon had been diagnosed with bone cancer.Ed McMahon ill with pneumonia - Reuters Reuters UK February 27, 2009.

==Death==

McMahon died on June 23, 2009, shortly after midnight at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. He was 86 years old. His nurse, Julie Koehne, RN, stated he went peacefully.  No formal cause of death was given, but McMahon's publicist attributed his death to the many health problems he had suffered over his final months.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8115052.stm|title=American TV star Ed McMahon dies|date=2009-06-24|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-06-24[/tpl] McMahon had said that he still suffered from the injury to his neck in March 2007.Yahoo: Ed McMahon's death at 86.

There will never be anything like that again."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/movies/conan-obrien-pays-tribute-to-ed-mcmahon-dead-at-86|title=Conan O'Brien pays tribute to Ed McMahon, dead at 86|last=Barrett|first=Liz|date=2009-06-24|work=Newsroom New Jersey|accessdate=2009-06-24[/tpl]
