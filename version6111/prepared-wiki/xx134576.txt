==Music video==

The music video for the song "Flick of the Switch" was done in a similar format to the music videos for the album Back in Black. The video shows the band playing the song inside of what was later revealed to be a closed up airplane hangar, surrounded by amplifiers with the AC/DC logo painted on them. Some versions of the video start with a short clip from a rehearsal tape of the band that shows Angus practicing dance moves for his onstage striptease while one of the band members, presumably Brian Johnson, sings in the background and the rest of the band laugh. However, the video on the Family Jewels DVD removes this.
Said Malcolm Young later of the simple approach to the video, "We basically told the film crew, 'We'll be playing – you film. Walk around the band – do whatever the fuck you want. We just want it done today'."[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl]
Drummer Phil Rudd had left the band by the time the video was recorded, and his replacement Simon Wright is featured instead.
