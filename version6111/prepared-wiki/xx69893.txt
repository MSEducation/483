Iraq Suwaydan ([tpl]lang|ar|عراق سويدان[/tpl]) was a Palestinian Arab village located 27 kilometers northeast of Gaza City. It was captured by Israeli forces in Operation Yoav against the defending Egyptian Army during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The village infrastructure, with the exception of the police station built by the British Mandate authorities, was destroyed. 

==History==

In the late nineteenth century, Iraq Suwaydan was described as a moderate-sized village situated on a plain.Conder and  Kitchener, 1883,  SWP III, p.259. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.108 In 1931, the village had 81 houses. In 1942, the villagers established an elementary school and in 1947 shared its facilities with the children of the neighboring villages, Ibdis and Bayt 'Affa. There were 104 students in the mid-1940s.Khalidi, 1992, p.109
The main crop was grain, with some almond trees and grapes. In 1944/45 a total of 7,329 dunums was allocated to cereals, and 9 dunams were irrigated or used for orchards.Hadawi, 1970, p.87

==1948 and aftermath==

On May 12, 1948, the British authorities withdrew, handing over the police fort to the Egyptian army, which then garrisoned it.David Tal http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Vs2PAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177 War in Palestine, 1948: Israeli and Arab Strategy and Diplomacy, Routledge 2004  p.177. The fort controlled the road between al-Majdal and Bayt Jibrin as well as the main road to the Negev. The village was captured and destroyed during Operation Yoav. Eight Israeli attempts to capture the fort failed. It finally fell on 9 November 1948 after a massive bombardment including air strikes by B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft.
In 1953, Yad Natan was founded east of Iraq Suwaydan on village lands. In 1955, Otzem was established on village lands to the southeast and in 1956, Sde Yoav was established west of the site, close to village land.In 1992, remains of houses could be seen in a eucalyptus grove that the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi identified as the center of the village, along with cacti and remnants of a pool. Two roads, one passing through the village and the other leading to fields, were recognizable. The British police station, renamed Metzudat Yo'av, was still in use and the surrounding lands were cultivated by Israeli farmers.
