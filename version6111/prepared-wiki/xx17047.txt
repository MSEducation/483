Olsztyn [tpl]IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Olsztyn.ogg|'|o|l|sz|t|y|n[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-de|link=no|Allenstein[/tpl][tpl]Audlisten|De-Allenstein.ogg[/tpl]; Old Polish: Holstin; Old Prussian: Alnāsteini or Alnestabs; [tpl]lang-lt|Olštynas[/tpl]) is a city on the Łyna River in northeastern Poland.  Olsztyn is the capital of the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, and is a city with powiat rights.

==History==

In 1346, on Warmian land, the forest was cleared at a location on the Alle ( Alna river), now Łyna River, for a new settlement in Prussian Warmia. The following year, Teutonic Knights began the construction of an Ordensburg-type castle as a stronghold against the Old Prussians, and the settlement of Allenstein was first mentioned the following year.[tpl]By whom|date=July 2013[/tpl]  The German-language name Allenstein meant a castle on the Alle River, and the settlement became known in Polish-language transliteration as Olsztyn.  The settlement received municipal rights from Johannes von Leysen on 31 October 1353, and the castle was completed in 1397.  Allenstein was captured by the Kingdom of Poland during the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War in 1410, and again in 1414 during the Hunger War, but it was returned to the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights after hostilities ended.
Allenstein joined the Prussian Confederation in 1440.  It rebelled against the Teutonic Knights in 1454 upon the outbreak of the Thirteen Years' War and requested protection from the Polish Crown.  Although the Teutonic Knights captured the town the following year, it was retaken by Polish troops in 1463.  The Second Peace of Thorn in 1466 designated Allenstein and the Bishopric of Warmia as part of Royal Prussia under the sovereignty of the Crown of Poland.
From 1516 to 1521, Nicolaus Copernicus lived at the castle as administrator of both Allenstein and Mehlsack (now Pieniężno). Copernicus was in charge of the defenses of Allenstein and Warmia during the Polish-Teutonic War of 1519–21.
Allenstein was sacked by Swedish troops in both 1655 and 1708 during the Polish-Swedish wars, and the town's population was nearly wiped out in 1710 by epidemics of bubonic plague and cholera.
The town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772 during the First Partition of Poland.  A Prussian census recorded a population of 1,770 people, predominantly farmers, and Allenstein was administered within the Province of East Prussia.  It was visited by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1807 after his victories over the Prussian Army at Jena and Auerstedt.  By 1825, the town was inhabited by 1266 Poles and 1341 GermansHistoria Pomorza:(1815-1850),Gerard Labuda, Poznańskie Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Nauk,page 157, 1993 The German-language newspaper, Allensteiner Zeitung, was first published in 1841.  The town hospital was founded in 1867.
Allenstein became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany. Two years later, the city was connected by railway to Thorn (Toruń). Its first Polish language newspaper, the Gazeta Olsztyńska, was founded in 1886.  Allenstein's infrastructure developed rapidly: gas was installed in 1890, telephones in 1892, public water supply in 1898, and electricity in 1907.  In 1905, the city became the capital of Regierungsbezirk Allenstein, a government administrative region in East Prussia.  From 1818 to 1910, the city was administered within the East Prussia Allenstein District, after which it became an independent city.
Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, troops of the Russian Empire captured Allenstein in 1914, but it was recovered by the Imperial German Army in the Battle of Tannenberg.  The battle actually took place much closer to Allenstein than to Tannenberg (now Stębark), but the victorious Germans, having been defeated in the medieval battle of Tannenberg, named it as such for propaganda purposes.
After the defeat of Germany in World War I, the East Prussian plebiscite was held in 1920 to determine whether the  populace of the region, including Allenstein, wished to remain in East Prussia or become part of Poland.  In order to advertise the plebiscite, special postage stamps were produced by overprinting German stamps and sold commencing 3 April of that year.  One kind of overprint read PLÉBISCITE / OLSZTYN / ALLENSTEIN, while the other read TRAITÉ / DE / VERSAILLES / ART. 94 et 95 inside an oval whose border gave the full name of the plebiscite commission.  Each overprint was applied to 14 denominations ranging from 5 Pf to 3 M.  The plebiscite was held on 11 July, and produced 362,209 votes (97.8%) for East Prussia and 7,980 votes (2.2%) for Poland.  The stamps became invalid on 20 August.  Despite their short period of use, almost all of the stamps are cheaply available both used and unused.
The football club SV Hindenburg Allenstein played in Allenstein from 1921 to 1945.  After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Poles and Jews in Allenstein were increasingly persecuted.  In 1935, the Wehrmacht made the city the seat of the Allenstein Militärische Bereich. It was the home of the 11th Infanterie Division, the 11th Artillery Regiment, and the 217th Infanterie Division.
On 12 October 1939, after the German invasion of Poland that began World War II, the Wehrmacht established an Area Headquarters for Wehrkreis I that controlled the sub-areas of Allenstein, Lötzen (now Giżycko) and Zichenau (now Ciechanów).  Beginning in 1939, members of the Polish-speaking minority, especially members of the Union of Poles in Germany, were deported to German death camps.
Allenstein was plundered and burnt by the invading Soviet Red Army on 22 January 1945, as the Eastern Front reached the city.  Allenstein's German population evacuated the region or were subsequently expelled.  On 2 August 1945, the city became part of Poland according to the Potsdam Agreement, and officially renamed to the Polish Olsztyn. In October 1945, the German population of Olsztyn was expelled by Order of the City Commanders of Olsztyn.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
A tyre factory was founded in Olsztyn in 1967. Its subsequent names include OZOS, Stomil, and Michelin.
Olsztyn has been the capital of the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship since 1999. It was previously in the Olsztyn Voivodeship.

===Architecture===

The history of the castle in Olsztyn:
The castle was built between 1346–1353 and by then it had one wing on the north-east side of the rectangular courtyard. Access to the castle lead from the drawbridge over the river Łyna (Alle), surrounded by a belt of defensive walls and a moat. The south-west wing of the castle was built in the 15th century, the tower situated in the west corner of the courtyard, from the middle of 14th century, was rebuilt in the early 16th century  and had a round shape on a square base and was 40 meters high. At the same time the castle walls were raised to a height of 12 meters and a second belt of the lower walls was built. The castle walls were partly combined with city walls, which made the castle look like it had been a powerful bastion defending access to the city. 
The castle was owned by Warmia Chapter, which until 1454, together with the Prince-Bishop of Warmia, was under military protection of the Teutonic Knights and their Monastic State of Prussia.
The castle had played a huge role in the Polish-Teutonic wars by then. After the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, the Poles took it after a few days siege. In the Thirteen Years' War (1454–66) it was jumping from rule to rule. The Knights threatened the castle and the town in 1521, but the defence was very effective. They contained one failed assault. There is a connection between the history of the castle, the city of Olsztyn, and Nicolaus Copernicus. He prepared the defense of Olsztyn against the invasion of the Teutonic Knights.
In the sixteenth century, there were two prince-bishops of Warmia that stayed there: Johannes Dantiscus – "the first sarmatian poet, endowed with the imperial laurel wreath for "Latin Songs" (1538, 1541) and Marcin Kromer, who wrote with equal ease in Latin and Polish scientific and literary works (1580). Kromer consecrated the chapel of St. Anna, which was built in the south-west wing of the castle. In the course of time both wings of the castle lost military importance, which for residential purposes has become very convenient. In 1779 Prince-Bishop Ignacy Krasicki stopped here as well.
After the Royal Prussian annexation of Warmia in 1772, the castle became the property of the state board of estates (War and Domain Chamber, Kriegs- und Domänenkammer). In 1845 the bridge over the moat was replaced by a dam better connecting the castle with the city. In 1901–1911 a general renovation of the castle was performed, however several sections of the building were violated at the same time where they changed the original look of the castle e.g. putting on window frames in a cloister. The tower was crowned in 1921 and again in 1926 in the halls of the castle, became a museum.
In 1945 the whole castle became home to the Masurian Museum, which today is called the Museum of Warmia and Masuria. In addition there are also popular events held within the frameworks of the Olsztyn Artistic Summer and so called “evenings of the castle” and “Sundays in the Museum”.

==Jewish community==

Though Jews did trade in the city fairs during medieval times, they were not allowed to trade freely in the villages surrounding the city.W. Knercer, Cmentarze i zabytki kultury żydowskiej w województwie olsztyńskim, „Borussia”, no. 6, 1993, p. 53; vide K. Forstreuter, Die ersten Juden in Ostpreussen, „Altpreussische Forschungen”, ch. 14, 1937, pp. 42-48. In 1718, Bishop Teodor Andrzej Potocki imposed a ban on Jewish trade.http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/olsztyn-607/5,history/#footnote_0 Other bishops after him continued the ban, which apparently wasn't successful since the city population complained about Jews dealing with animal leather and other products in 1742. Permanent Jews were found in the city in 1780, and they were allowed to settle outside the city walls.J. Jasiński, Olsztyn w latach 1772 - 1918, in: Olsztyn “1353 - 2003, ed. S. Achremczyk, W. Ogrodziński, Olsztyn 2003, p. 228. In 1814, the Simonson brothers opened the first Jewish store in town. In 1850, the city official authority announced that any citizen that hosted a wondering Jew in his house, would be fined and imprisoned.J. Jasiński, Olsztyn w latach 1772 - 1918, in: Olsztyn 1353 - 2003, ed. S. Achremczyk, W. Ogrodziński, Olsztyn 2003, p. 229.
The Jewish community of the city as a congregation was established in 1820. Shortly after, a prayer room was established on Richterstrasse. In 1877, the congregation bought a plot of land on Liebstädterstrasse and built a synagogue there.http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/olsztyn-607/11,synagogues-prayer-houses-and-others/322,old-synagogue/ A Jewish cemetery was built on Seestrasse (present-day Grundwalzka). In town, Mendelsohn planned the mourners' chapel (called the Mendelsohn house) next to the cemetery. While at its peak, the town's Jewish population was 448 Jews in 1933.
On Kristallnacht, the town synagogue was destroyed and later used as a bomb shelter.http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/synagogues-and-communities?pid=71&sid=92:allenstein Now, a sports' club sits on the site of the synagogue.http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/cms/activity/863,jewish-culture-in-olsztyn/
By 1939, 135 Jews were left in the city, after most others fled from the country. Those who lived in town in 1940 were deported to Concentration camps.http://www.bundesarchiv.de/gedenkbuch/directory.html#frmResults (matches for “Allenstein”, with marked: “Wohnort” and “Geburtsort”; (as of 25 March 2009); http://www.yadvashem.org/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_2KE?next_form=advanced_search (people living in Olsztyn before the war – matches for “Allenstein”, with marked: “Before the War”, (as of 25 March 2009); http://www.yadvashem.org/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_2KE?next_form=advanced_search (people born in Olsztyn – matches for “Allenstein”, with marked: “Birth”; (as of 25 March 2009). In June 1946, 16 Holocaust survivors settled in the city and in 1948, the congregation had 190 worshipers. Most of them emigrated to Israel throughout the next few decades. There is no current trace of the Jewish cemetery.http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/olsztyn-607/12,cemeteries/1944,cemetery/
The city was the birthplace of world famous Jewish architect Erich Mendelsohn. In town, Mendelsohn planned the mourners' chapel (called the Mendelsohn house) next to the cemetery.http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/olsztyn-607/39,heritage-sites/26740,dom-rodzinny-ericha-mendelsohna/ The building is currently restored.http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/cms/news/850,mendelsohn-s-house-will-be-renovated/ In addition, it was the birthplace of German Socialist and SPD leader Hugo Haase. Frieda Strohmberg, an Impressionist, lived and worked in the city from 1910 to 1927.
