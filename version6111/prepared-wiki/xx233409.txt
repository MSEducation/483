York Park is a sports ground located in the Inveresk and York Park Precinct, Launceston, Australia. It has the highest capacity of any stadium in Tasmania, holding 20,000. Since 2004, it has been known as Aurora Stadium under a six-year naming rights agreement with Aurora Energy.

York Park has been used as an international sports venue since 2001. Beforehand, only North Launceston and state football games were played. The area was originally swampland before becoming Launceston's showgrounds in 1873. Work started on transforming the area into a sports venue in 1919 and was completed within two years.
Australian rules football has been played at York Park since 1923, with other sports such as cricket, tennis, bowling, cycling and foot-racing also staged. Since 2001, the Hawthorn Football Club has played between two and five AFL matches a year at the ground, and the St Kilda Football Club played two games a year from 2003 to 2006. The Tasmanian Government has a A$16.4-million, five-year sponsorship deal with Hawthorn, meaning that four home and away season games and one National Australia Bank Cup pre-season match will be played at the venue each year. On 21 February 2009 the ground became home of the Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame. Throughout its history, York Park has hosted major pop concerts and other entertainments. A redevelopment at a cost of $23.6Â million was completed in 2005.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/31/2203444.htm|title=Arson suspected in historic grandstand fire|publisher=ABC News|date=2008-03-31|accessdate=2008-06-09[/tpl]

Every October the Royal Launceston Show is held at the Inveresk Showgrounds. The show runs for three days, starting on a Thursday (Which is a public holiday in Northern Tasmania) and ending on Sunday. The Royal Launceston Show is principally an agricultural event which focuses on the primary industries of Tasmania, and rural lifestyle of many Tasmanians with events such as livestock judging, equestrian events, animal breeders competitions, produce competitions and wood chopping, although it also incorporates live entertainment, sporting events, food tasting, and fashion shows. A popular feature of the show is the sideshows which feature showrides, foodstalls, games of skill, and showbag stalls.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.totaltravel.com.au/travel/tas/launceston/launceston/events/festivals/the-royal-launceston/details/|title=The Royal Launceston Show|accessdate=2008-11-16|publisher=Total Travel[/tpl]
The MS fest has been held annually since 2006. The festival started at Launceston's Regatta Ground to mark the 50th anniversary of the MS society, and it was a big success with all tickets being sold.
