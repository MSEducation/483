[[Achilles and Briseis]]

CATEGORIES: Pompeii (ancient city)

Achilles and Briseis is a picture depicting plateaux from the Iliad relating to the gifting of Briseis to Achilles found in the House of the Tragic Poet Pompeii, Italy.  The image is painted in distemper, similar to coloured white-washing and intermediary between fresco and paint.  It was at one time moved to the Naples National Archaeological Museum.  Agostino Carracci produced an engraving from it which was included in his collection of erotic poses, I Modi.
