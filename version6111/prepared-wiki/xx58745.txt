Florence Foster Jenkins (July 19, 1868[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]November 26, 1944) was an American amateur operatic soprano who was known—and ridiculed—for her lack of rhythm, pitch, and tone; her aberrant pronunciation; and her generally poor singing ability.

==Early years==

Born Narcissa Florence Foster in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, to Charles Dorrance Foster and Mary Jane Hoagland,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/other/jenkins.html |title=Ancestry of Florence Foster Jenkins |first=Julie Helen |last=Otto |publisher=William Addams Reitwiesner Genealogical Services[/tpl] Jenkins received music lessons as a child, and expressed a desire to go abroad to study opera. Her wealthy father refused to pay the bill, so she eloped to Philadelphia with Frank Thornton Jenkins, a physician. The two were married from 1885 until 1902. After her divorce Jenkins earned a living in Philadelphia as a teacher and pianist. In 1908 she began living with the stage actor St. Clair Bayfield (later her manager), a relationship that would last the rest of her life.Peters, Brooks, "Florence, The Nightingale?,"[tpl]Dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl] June 15, 2006 (also appeared, but in slightly different format, in Opera News magazine) [tpl]Page needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
When her father died in 1909 Jenkins inherited sufficient funds to begin her long-delayed singing career.[tpl]cite news |first=F. Gwynplaine |last=MacIntyre |authorlink=F.

She began giving recitals in 1912. Her mother's death in 1928 gave her additional resources to pursue her singing career.

==Career==

From her recordings it is apparent that Jenkins had little sense of pitch and rhythm, and was barely capable of sustaining a note. Her accompanist can be heard making adjustments to compensate for her tempo variations and rhythmic mistakes. Her dubious diction, especially in foreign language songs, is also noteworthy. Nonetheless, she became popular for the amusement she provided. Critics often described her work in a backhanded way that may have served to pique public curiosity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
Despite her patent lack of ability, Jenkins apparently was firmly convinced of her greatness. She compared herself favorably to the renowned sopranos Frieda Hempel and Luisa Tetrazzini, and dismissed the abundant audience laughter during her performances as "professional jealousy." She was aware of her critics, but never let them stand in her way: "People may say I can't sing," she said, "but no one can ever say I didn't sing."[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]

Her recitals featured a mixture of the standard operatic repertoire by Mozart, Verdi, and Johann Strauss (all well beyond her technical ability); lieder by Brahms; Valverde's "Clavelitos" ("Little Carnations"), a favorite encore; and songs composed by herself or accompanist Cosmé McMoon, who reportedly made faces at Jenkins behind her back to get laughs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
Jenkins often wore elaborate costumes that she designed herself, sometimes appearing in wings and tinsel, and, for "Clavelitos", throwing flowers into the audience from a basket (apparently on one occasion, she hurled the basket as well) while fluttering a fan and sporting more flowers in her hair. After each performance McMoon would collect the flowers from the auditorium in readiness for redistribution during the next show.Theatrum Anatomicum by Pablo Helguera, p. 40 (2009) ISBN 1-934978-16-7.
After a taxicab crash in 1943 she discovered that she could sing "a higher F than ever before", and sent the cab driver a box of expensive cigars.Carnegie Hall, the first one hundred years by Richard Schickel and Michael Walsh, p. 173 (1987) ISBN 0-8109-0773-9.
In spite of public demand, Jenkins restricted her rare performances to a few favorite venues and one annual recital at the Ritz-Carlton ballroom in New York City. Attendance was limited to her loyal clubwomen and a select few others; she handled distribution of the coveted tickets herself. At the age of 76 she finally yielded to public demand and performed at Carnegie Hall on October 25, 1944. Tickets for the event sold out weeks in advance. Jenkins died a month later at her residence, the Hotel Seymour in Manhattan.

==Recordings==

The only professional audio recordings of Jenkins consist of nine selections on five 78-rpm records (Melotone Recording Studio, New York City; 1941–1944). These include four coloratura arias from operas by Mozart, Delibes, Johann Strauss II, and Félicien David; and five art songs, two of them written for Jenkins by her accompanist, Cosmé McMoon.  Four of the selections—Queen of the Night Aria, Biassy, Adele's Laughing Song, and Like A Bird—were issued in the UK on an HMV EP (7EB 6022) in 1956, and reissued by RCA (RCX 157) in 1959.
The material has been reissued in various combinations on three CDs:
