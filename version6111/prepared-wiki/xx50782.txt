The Columbus Crew is an American professional soccer club based in Columbus, Ohio which competes in Major League Soccer (MLS). It is one of the ten charter clubs of MLS, having competed in the league since its inception.
The Crew were owned by Lamar Hunt, who also owned the Kansas City Chiefs, Kansas City Wizards (now Sporting Kansas City), and Dallas Burn (now FC Dallas) until his death in 2006, when his son Clark Hunt took ownership of his sports properties. In 2013 Hunt's majority stake in the club was sold to Anthony Precourt and Precourt Sports Ventures. The Crew currently play their home games at Columbus Crew Stadium, the first professional soccer-specific stadium ever built in the United States, with a seating capacity of 22,555 as of the 2013 Season. From 1996 to 1998, the Crew played their home games at Ohio Stadium on the campus of the Ohio State University.
The Crew has won five major trophies: MLS Cup 2008, the 2004, 2008, and 2009 Supporters' Shields, and the 2002 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. The Crew won the 2002 Open Cup by defeating the Los Angeles Galaxy, 1–0, at Columbus Crew Stadium.  The Crew then won its first MLS Supporters' Shield in 2004 in a tie-breaker over the Kansas City Wizards. In 2008 the Crew won its second Supporters' Shield en route to defeating the New York Red Bulls in MLS Cup 2008, 3–1.  
The nickname "the Crew" is the result of a local fan contest.  The team colors are black and gold. The team mascot is Crew Cat. 

==History==

===The Beginning: 1994–1998===

On June 15, 1994, Major League Soccer announced that Columbus, Ohio, would be home to one of the ten founding members of the new top flight North American professional soccer league.  Columbus had promised construction of a soccer–specific stadium and had sold over 12,000 season ticket deposits.[tpl]cite news|last=Zeigler|first=Mark|title=New league has old woes: Not enough teams; too many seats; not enough money|newspaper=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=June 16, 1994[/tpl]  MLS investor Lamar Hunt, and his son Clark  became the owners of both the Columbus Crew and Kansas City Wizards in 1996.  The first players for the Crew were South African national team veteran Doctor Khumalo, by assignment, and Brian McBride.  McBride was selected as the first overall pick in MLS's first draft in 1996.  Former U.S. National Team coach, Timo Liekoski would be the team's head coach for its first season.[tpl]cite news|title=Sports People: Soccer; Liekoski to Columbus|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/06/sports/sports-people-soccer-liekoski-to-columbus.html|newspaper=New York Timies|date=December 6, 1995[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=2011 Columbus Crew Media Guide|url=http://mlsdigitalpr.drupalgardens.com/sites/mlsdigitalpr.drupalgardens.com/files/2011%20Columbus%20Crew%20Media%20Guide.pdf|pages=14–20|publisher=Columbus Crew|accessdate=November 8, 2011[/tpl]
The Crew played their first game on April 13, 1996 against D.C. United and won 4–0 in front of a home crowd of 25,266 in Ohio Stadium.[tpl]cite news|title=Crew opens with shutout over D.C.|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_docid=0F51AFDB763CBF64&p_docnum=1|newspaper=Dayton Daily News|date=April 14, 1996[/tpl]  Columbus would struggle, however, winning only 5 of their next 21 games.  After the 6–16 start, Tom Fitzgerald replaced head coach Liekoski.[tpl]cite news|title=Fitzgerald fired as coach of MLS Crew|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-05-18/sports/0105180095_1_columbus-crew-tom-fitzgerald-doctors|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=May 18, 2001[/tpl]  The Crew, under Fitzgerald, won 9 of their last 10 games to finish fourth in the Eastern Conference.  They went on to lose in the conference semifinals of the playoffs.[tpl]cite web|title=2011 Columbus Crew Media Guide|url=http://mlsdigitalpr.drupalgardens.com/sites/mlsdigitalpr.drupalgardens.com/files/2011%20Columbus%20Crew%20Media%20Guide.pdf|pages=89–93|publisher=Columbus Crew|accessdate=November 8, 2011[/tpl]
The Crew finished 15–17 in both 1997 and 1998, which put them in third and fourth place, respectively, in the Eastern Conference.  Each season ended with losses in the Conference Finals to D.C. United. The Crew reached the 1998 U.S. Open Cup Final, which was postponed due to a hurricane and controversially relocated from Virginia Beach to Soldier Field in Chicago then the home of Chicago Fire, who won the match 2 to 1 after extra time.  Stern John, in his first of two seasons with Columbus, was the 1998 scoring champion, amassing 26 goals and 5 assists.

===A New Home: 1999–2003===

The Crew's 1999 season began with the opening of Columbus Crew Stadium, the first soccer–specific stadium in the United States. Columbus won their first game in the stadium, 2–0, against New England Revolution in front of a sell–out crowd of 24,741. Columbus would finish in 2nd place in at 19–13, but would lose in the conference finals to D.C. United for the third straight season.  The 1999 season was the last for Stern John who scored 52 goals in 65 games for the club.
Dante Washington was acquired from the Dallas Burn to replace John, but his 13 goals in 2000 was not enough to propel the Crew to the playoffs.  For the first time, Columbus failed to reach the postseason. Columbus got off to a slow 1–3–2 start in 2001, which led to the replacement of coach Tom Fitzgerald.  Fitzgerald, who had coached 161 of the Crew's first 183 MLS matches over parts of six seasons between 1996 and 2001, was replaced by Greg Andrulis.  Andrulis would lead the Crew to a 2nd place finish in 2001 but the team was ousted from the playoffs in the league quarterfinals.
In 2002, Columbus would win the U.S. Open Cup for the first time in team history. They advanced to the finals by beating the Richmond Kickers, NY/NJ MetroStars, and Kansas City Wizards. In the final, they beat LA Galaxy, who had just won the MLS Cup earlier in the week.  Freddy García scored the only goal and keeper Jon Busch posted the shutout in Columbus's 1–0 win.  It was the first championship in team history.[tpl]cite news|title=Crew earn first trophy with Open Cup win|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/tourneys/2002-10-24-open-cup_x.htm|newspaper=U.S.A. Today|date=October 25, 2002[/tpl]  The Crew finished 11–12–5 in the regular season and finished in a tie for first place.  The lost in the league semifinals to New England. Kyle Martino won rookie of the year in 2002, a first for the Crew. By winning the 2002 U.S. Open Cup, Columbus received a bid to play in the 2003 CONCACAF Champions' Cup. The advanced to the second round by beating Árabe Unido (Panama) 4–2 on aggregate in the first round before losing to Monarcas Morelia, 6–2. McBride would play his final season with the Crew in 2003 before joining Fulham F.C. of the Premier League.

===Transitions: 2004–2006===

With the departure of McBride, the Crew added Robin Fraser and Simon Elliott to the club.  These additions proved to be vital as Fraser went on to win the Defender of the Year award in 2004.  The Crew set a franchise record for points, 49, by going 12–5–13, thanks in part to an 18–game unbeaten streak (8–0–10) to end the season.  Despite winning the Supporters' Shield for best record in the league, the club would be eliminated from the MLS Cup in the Eastern Conference semifinals.  In his last season for the Crew, Jeff Cunningham scored his 62nd goal, which tied him with McBride for the  franchise record.
Over both of the next two seasons, Columbus battled injuries to several players and struggle to win games.  Despite winning the  MLS Coach of the Year Award in 2004,[tpl]cite web|title=Andrulis, Crew Agree To New Contract|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3110965&l_id=&t_id=|publisher=OurSports Central|accessdate=November 16, 2011[/tpl] Andrulis was replaced on an interim basis by Robert Warzycha midway through the 2005 season.  After missing playoffs in the 2005 season, the club would hire former L.A. Galaxy and UCLA head coach Sigi Schmid. Schmid had won an MLS Cup and U.S. Open Championship in six seasons with Galaxy.[tpl]cite news|title=Crew hires head coach|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/2005/10/17/daily27.html?jst=b_ln_hl|newspaper=Columbus Business First|date=October 20, 2005[/tpl]  Warzycha remained on staff under Schmid.  In 2006, the Crew went on a 13 game winless streak (0–7–6) between June 10 and August 19.  The season ended on a tragic note when team founder and owner Lamar Hunt died on December 14, 2006.[tpl]cite news|title=Lamar Hunt, Chiefs owner and sports legend, dies at 74|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2697040|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=November 17, 2011[/tpl]

===The Barros Schelotto Era: 2007–2010===

The 2007 season in Major League Soccer started with news that global icon David Beckham signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy.[tpl]cite news|title=David Beckham Signs Deal with L.A.

Even with these new players, the Crew still missed the playoffs in 2007.
In 2008, the Crew won its first MLS Cup.  Led by Barros Schelotto, who scored seven goals and had 19 assists and won the MLS Most Valuable Player Award,[tpl]cite news|title=Crew's Schelotto wins MLS MVP Award|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/mls/crew/2008-11-20-schelotto-mvp-award_N.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=November 20, 2008[/tpl] the team also won its second Supporters' Shield.  After going 17–7–6 in the regular season, the Crew won playoff games against Kansas City and Chicago Fire before beating the New York Red Bulls 3–1 in the final.  Chad Marshall won MLS Defender of the Year award, and Sigi Schmid won Coach of the Year.
After the 2008 season, Sigi Schmid left the Crew to coach the Seattle Sounders, and the team named former player and assistant coach Robert Warzycha head coach. In 2009, Barros Schelotto was rewarded with the honor of becoming the franchise's first Designated Player.[tpl]cite news|last=Bell|first=Jack|title=In M.L.S., Designated Players Do Not Guarantee Great Expectations|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/18/sports/soccer/18soccer.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 17, 2009[/tpl] The club went 13–7–10 in the regular season, good enough for 49 points and their second consecutive Supporters' Shield.  The Crew was eliminated by Real Salt Lake in the two–legged Eastern Conference Semifinals, 4–2 on aggregate. Chad Marshall won his second consecutive MLS Defender of the Year award.
The Crew started the 2010 season in the CONCACAF Champions League.  They reached the quarterfinals, but lost to Toluca FC of Mexico in March. The Crew finished the season 14–8–8, but lost in the quarterfinals of the MLS Cup to the Colorado Rapids. The Crew lost 2-1 in the 2010 U.S. Open Cup Final at Qwest Field, home of Seattle Sounders. After the 2010 season, Guillermo Barros Schelotto, Frankie Hejduk, Brian Carroll, Jason Garey, Steven Lenhart, Gino Padula, Eric Brunner, Adam Moffat, and Duncan Oughton all left the team,.[tpl]cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Shawn|title=Fan-favorite Schelotto leaving Columbus Crew|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2010/11/16/gbs2_Schelotto.html|newspaper=Columbus Dispatch|date=November 15, 2010[/tpl]

==Colors and badge==

Prior to the initial MLS season a city-wide public contest was created to decide the name for the team, the very first entry was a hit, and The Columbus Crew was born.
The club badge - unique amongst MLS teams in that it features people - contains three silhouetted males wearing construction hats beneath a stylized "Crew" wordmark. The logo is intended to represent a crew of hard working people, much like the hard working, blue collar image the city of Columbus cultivates.
The official colors of the Columbus Crew are black and gold. The Crew's usual primary jersey is predominately bright yellow with black trim, and has been nicknamed the "banana kit" or "canary kit" by fans. 
The alternate kit is usually black, but is seldom worn by the Crew, due to the strong favor shown to the all yellow home kit, and due to the fact that the black jerseys compound the heat of summer in the United States. Only occasionally has Crew not worn a black or yellow jersey.  In 2007, the Crew wore a predominantly white away shirt with yellow trim, and in 1997 they wore a white away shirt with yellow and black striped "bumblebee"-style sleeves.

==Stadium==

Initially the Columbus Crew played their home games at the 102,000-capacity Ohio Stadium, home of the Ohio State Buckeyes American college football team. They ended with a 33-20 record while playing there.
On May 15, 1999, the Crew opened Columbus Crew Stadium, the first soccer-specific stadium in Major League Soccer, as the Crew beat the New England Revolution 2-0 before a sold-out crowd of 24,741.  It has been the model stadium for the rest of the league, and one of the stadiums used by the United States national team in World Cup qualifying.

==Revenue and Profitability==

Having lost money in 2011, in 2012 the Crew identified three financial goals with the aim of achieving financial stability.[tpl]cite web |title=The Columbus Dispatch, Crew catching up financially to rest of MLS |date=September 13, 2012 |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/business/2012/09/13/scoring-goals.html[/tpl] First, the team wanted a new jersey sponsor, which it achieved when they reached a deal with Barbasol.  Second, the team wanted to sell naming rights to the Columbus Crew Stadium, hoping for $15 million over 10 years.  Third, the Crew had announced in September 2011 that it aimed to increase season-ticket sales from its current levels (later revealed to be 4,000) to 10,000.Sports Business Journal, Crew makes strides off the field but remains short of season-ticket sales goal, Nov. 19, 2012, http://m.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2012/11/19/Franchises/Crew.aspx  By November 2012, Crew season tickets were at 6,000,Sports Business Journal, Crew makes strides off the field but remains short of season-ticket sales goal, Nov. 19, 2012, http://m.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2012/11/19/Franchises/Crew.aspx and by August 2013, the Crew had surpassed 7,000 season ticket holders.Columbus Business First, Columbus Crew getting season-ticket boost from U.S.-Mexico packages, August 9, 2013, http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/blog/2013/08/columbus-crew-getting-season-ticket.html

===Sponsors===

The Crew signed a five-year deal in early 2012 with Barbasol as the team's shirt sponsor. The deal with Barbasol — which is based in Dublin, Ohio — is the most lucrative sponsorship deal in franchise history, although financial terms were not disclosed.Sports Business Daily, MLS Crew Ink Five-Year Jersey Sponsorship Deal With Barbasol Brand, Feb 16, 2012, http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2012/02/16/Marketing-and-Sponsorship/Crew.aspx 
Previously, Glidden was the Crew's shirt sponsor from 2008 to 2010, a deal worth $1 million per year.

==Club culture==

===Supporters: The Nordecke Transformation===

Before the 2008 season, the Columbus Crew front office demolished the north stands where the most ardent of Crew supporters stood, in order to build a stage that would provide additional revenue by facilitating concerts and other events. Prior to this, the team's three supporters groups (Crew Supporters Union, Hudson Street Hooligans, and La Turbina Amarilla) sat apart because of differences between the groups ranging from age to ethnicity. The building of the stage forced the groups to come together into the north corner of the stadium, forming one large block of vocal and artistic support. Putting their differences aside the three groups formed the "Nordecke," (pronounced Nort-'eck'-eh) which is German for "North Corner." The name "Nordecke" celebrates the city's German heritage.
In 2008 a large contingency of fans from the Nordecke began traveling together to support the Crew during their away campaigns.  In late 2009/early 2010 the term "NorOnTour" became popular thanks to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, to describe the frequent large and rowdy traveling support.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.thecrew.com/news/2010/08/sirk%E2%80%99s-notebook|title=Nordecke on tour|work=Thecrew.com |author=Steve Sirk[/tpl]

===Rivalries===

The Crew has a rivalry with the Chicago Fire.SB Nation, Chicago Fire vs. Columbus Crew - MLS #12 - Three Questions, May 25, 2012, http://www.hottimeinoldtown.com/2012/5/25/3043711/chicago-fire-vs-columbus-crew-mls-12-three-questions-literally Columbus is roughly a six-hour drive away from Chicago. Due to the relative close proximity of the two cities, it is not uncommon for supporters of both teams to make the trip to support their club in matches between the two. In the 2008 season, Columbus defeated Chicago in the Eastern Conference Championship match.
MLS frames matches between Toronto FC and Columbus as a rivalry, creating a trophy called the Trillium Cup, awarded to the team that wins the rivalry.
The Crew contests F.C. Dallas for the Lamar Hunt Pioneer Cup. Lamar Hunt was the owner of both of these teams until his death.

==Broadcasting==

Crew matches are currently broadcast on Time Warner SportsChannel Ohio, with Dwight Burgess providing play-by-play commentary, Chris Doran giving analysis and Ashleigh Ignelzi as the sideline reporter.
