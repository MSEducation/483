A number of inventions were made in the medieval Islamic world, a geopolitical region that has at various times extended from Spain and Africa in the west to Afghanistan and the Indian subcontinent in the east.Bernard Lewis, What Went Wrong: [tpl]quote|"There have been many civilizations in human history, almost all of which were local, in the sense that they were defined by a region and an ethnic group.  This applied to all the ancient civilizations of the Middle East—Ancient Egypt, Babylon, Persia; to the great civilizations of Asia—India, China; and to the civilizations of Pre-Columbian America. There are two exceptions: Christianity and Islam. These are two civilizations defined by religion, in which religion is the primary defining force, not, as in India or China, a secondary aspect among others of an essentially regional and ethnically defined civilization. Here, again, another word of explanation is necessary."[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] The inventions listed here were developed during the medieval Islamic world, which covers a period from the early Caliphate to the later Ottoman, Safavid and Mughal empires.[tpl]cite web|author=Danny Yee|title=Islam: The Straight Path, John L.
