I’ve never fought in the UFC, but I would love to fight in the UFC. But right now because of my contract with Showtime and Stikeforce, hopefully things can work out because there is a show in San Jose that Cain Velasquez is the main event. I would love to fight in San Jose for the UFC ....” said Le.[tpl]cite web |url= http://mmaweekly.com/its-ufc-or-bust-for-former-strikeforce-champ-cung-le |title=It’s UFC or Bust for Former Strikeforce Champ Cung Le |date=July 25, 2011 |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |accessdate=2011-07-25[/tpl] In an interview with BloodyElbow on October 27, 2012, Le revealed he originally signed a six-fight contract with the UFC.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/10/27/3563308/ufc-macao-cung-le-says-no-to-trt |title=UFC Macao: Cung Le says no to TRT |date=October 27, 2012 |publisher=bloodyelbow.com |accessdate=2013-01-07[/tpl]
