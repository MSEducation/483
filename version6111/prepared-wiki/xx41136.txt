====Composition====

Bronze cents, 1909–1942. Initially the alloy of the Lincoln cent followed that established for this denomination with the Indian Head design in 1864, 95% copper and 5% tin and zinc. 
Zinc-plated steel cents, 1943. The composition of the Lincoln cent was changed in 1943.
Production of the war-time cent was provided for in an Act of Congress approved on December 18, 1942, which also set as the expiration date of the authority December 31, 1946. Low-grade carbon steel formed the base of these coins, to which a zinc coating [tpl]convert|0.005|in|mm|sing=on[/tpl] thick was deposited on each side electrolytically as a rust preventive. This coating was applied to the steel before the blanks were made, leaving the rims of these coins extremely susceptible to rust. The same size was maintained, but the weight was reduced from the standard [tpl]convert|48|gr|g[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|42|gr|g[/tpl], by using a lighter alloy. Production commenced on February 27, 1943, and by December 31 of that year, the three Mint facilities had produced 1,093,838,670 of the one-cent coins. The copper released for the war effort was enough to meet the combined needs of two cruisers, two destroyers, 1,243 Flying Fortresses, 120 field guns and 120 howitzers, or enough for 1,250,000 shells for large field guns.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/about/education/Pages/lincoln-cent.aspx|title=History of the Lincoln Cent|date=2011-01-04|publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury|accessdate=2011-06-27[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Herbert |first=Alan |editor-last=Deisher |editor-first=Beth |journal=COINS Magazine |title=1943 Cent in Steel – One Year Type Looked to Help With the War Effort |date=September 2007 |page=14[/tpl]
Shell-casing brass cents, 1944–1946. Numerous complaints about the gray color of the 1943 cents, especially that they could be mistaken for dimes, led to a change in composition. On January 1, 1944, the Mint was able to adopt a modified alloy, the supply being derived from expended shell casings which, when melted, furnished a composition similar to the original, but with a much smaller trace of tin.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] The original weight of [tpl]convert|48|gr|g[/tpl] was also restored.
Bronze, 1946–1962. Shell casings were no longer used after 1946 and the original copper-tin-zinc "bronze" composition was again used.
Brass cents, 1962–1982 The composition of the coin was changed again in 1962. Mint officials felt that deletion of the tin content would have no adverse effect on the wearing qualities of the coin, whereas the manufacturing advantages to be gained with the alloy stabilized at 95% copper and 5% zinc would be of much benefit. Congressional authority for this modification is contained in an Act of Congress approved on September 5, 1962.
Experimental aluminum cents, 1974. During the early 1970s, the price of copper rose to a point where the cent almost contained one cent's worth of copper. This led the Mint to test alternate metals, including aluminum and bronze-clad steel. Aluminum was chosen, and in 1973, a total of 1,579,324 such coins were struck (dated 1974) and ready for public release. A few were distributed to members of the US Congress, but aluminum was ultimately rejected for a variety of reasons. About a dozen aluminum cents are believed to still be in the hands of collectors, although they are now considered illegal to own.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Hx-Aa4mIUNYC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64|archiveurl=http://financialservices.house.gov/media/pdf/071906bd.pdf|archivedate=2006-07-19|journal=Coin World|last1=Gibbs|first1=William T.|title=1974 bronze-clad steel cents subject to federal confiscation|date=September 26, 1994|page=1|editor=Beth Deisher|accessdate=2011-06-27[/tpl] One aluminum cent was donated to the Smithsonian Institution.

Copper-plated zinc, 1982 to date. In mid-1982, the coin's composition was changed again, this time to copper-plated zinc. The last mostly-copper cents (95% copper metal composition) were produced by the Denver Mint on October 22, 1982. The copper-plated zinc cent coins are still being produced today. They are composed of an inner core alloy of 99.2% zinc and 0.8% copper with an outer plating of pure copper, for an overall composition of 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper, and are minted on blanks produced for the Mint by an outside manufacturer (Jarden Zinc Products). Except for the new lighter total coin weight of 2.5 grams each, these newer coins are identical in diameter and thickness, and nearly in appearance, to the mostly copper (95%) cents issued before mid-1982, which weighed 3.11 grams each. A few pennies were struck by error in brass dated 1983 and are extremely rare.[tpl]Citeweb|url=http://www.pcgs.com/News/The-1983-Copper-Cent|title=The 1983 Copper Cent|work=www.pcgs.com|accessdate=2014-01-03[/tpl]

===Matte Proof Lincolns 1909 to 1916===

When the Lincoln Cent was introduced in 1909, it was discovered that the coining dies and their curved fields were unable to be polished to proof coining condition by existing Mint equipment. To produce Proof coinage for collectors, the US Mint adopted the French technique of the Matte Proof, which was thought to highlight the design, while leaving the details of the coin as the designer intended. This was done by a sandblasting of the dies prior to use. When struck by the high pressure hydraulic press of the Philadelphia Mint Medal Room, the result was a semi-rough surface, a gentle luster and strongly defined wide square rims. These coins were produced in very small numbers, and the dies quickly developed small marks, known as diagnostics. These marks are used today by Third Party Graders and Collectors to authenticate the coin. Sold for mere pennies over face during the years of production, they were not popular with collectors. When new, the coins were wrapped in a tarnish-proof tissue, which over time proved to be anything but. Since many of these coins sat for decades unsold, vivid colors and toning developed. It is not unusual to see vivid blues, greens, lavender, coppery orange, deep reds and purple hues on these coins. Eagerly collected by numismatists today, they are among the most valuable Lincoln cents. Unencapsulated coins are easily identified by wide, square outer rims, quite unlike the rounded edges of business strikes.

===Mint errors specific to Lincoln cents===

Through mint errors, a number of rare and valuable Lincoln Cents have been produced. Some random errors, such as an off-center strike, slightly increase the value of the coin, and are sought after by niche collectors. However some errors were systemic, and produced a number of coins with exactly the same problem in the same year. These have become recognized varieties that are often extremely valuable and sought after by mainstream collectors.
The first Doubled Die error occurred during the production of the 1909 VDB. Not identified until the 1970s, it shows the RTY in Liberty and the 190 of the date slightly doubled. This coin is extremely rare in high grades.
In 1922, no one-cent coins were produced by the Philadelphia Mint. However, three pairs of Denver Mint worn and overly polished dies then produced the Weak D and No D varieties, making them appear as if they had been produced in Philadelphia. These varieties are known as the 1922 plain cents. Collectors must be wary of removed mint marks.
There are a few 1943 cents that were produced in bronze, as opposed to the steel/zinc composition used that year. There are 10 to 12 known to exist.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coinfacts.com/small_cents/lincoln_cents/wheat_ear_cents/1943_copper_cent.htm |title=1943 Copper Cent |publisher=Coinfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-27[/tpl] Likewise, a few 1944 cents were produced in steel/zinc.
In 1955, a hubbing error caused some cents to get struck with an obverse die which showed doubling in all of the obverse devices, producing a prominent doubling of the date, and to a less noticeable degree, the rest of the obverse. This is known as the 1955 doubled die cent. A similar die error occurred in 1969 on dies used at the San Francisco Mint. While the 1955 doubled die cent is well-known and widely collected, the 1969-S doubled die is far rarer, with an uncirculated specimen selling for as much as $126,500 in a 2008 Heritage auction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://coins.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=454&Lot_No=2718 |title=1969-S 1C Doubled Die MS64 Red PCGS Lincoln Cents |publisher=Coins.ha.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-27[/tpl] A slightly different mechanism produced 1972, 1983, 1984, and 1995 Doubled die cents. Doubled Dies are known in practically every date in the Lincoln cent series, but most are minor, and less impressive compared to the 1955 and the other Doubled Die varieties mentioned here.
In 1990, 3,055 proof cents were struck at the San Francisco Mint without the "S" mint mark, making them appear as if they had been struck at the Philadelphia Mint. However, as no proof cents were struck in Philadelphia that year, they are easily distinguishable as errors, and highly valuable.
The reverse of some Lincoln cents minted in 1992 at the Philadelphia and Denver mints and some of those minted in 1998 and 1999 at the San Francisco mint feature a smaller-than-normal gap between the first two letters of AMERICA. These coins, known as the Close AM variety are valued at $20,000 and $5,000 for the 1992 specimens in gem uncirculated condition and $3,000 and $1,000 for the San Francisco specimens in gem proof condition.
The reverse of some Lincoln cents minted in 1998, 1999, and 2000 in Philadelphia feature a larger-than-normal gap between the first two letters of AMERICA. These coins, known as the Wide AM variety are valued at $10, $500, and $5, respectively, in gem uncirculated condition.

==Toxicity==

Zinc, a major component of mid-1982-and-later US cents, is toxic in large quantities. Swallowing such a coin, which is 97.5% zinc, can cause damage to the stomach lining because of the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.Dawn N. Bothwell, MD and Eric A. Mair, MD, FAAP. Chronic Ingestion of a Zinc-Based Penny, Pediatrics Vol. 111 No. March 3, 2003, pp. 689–691. Retrieved 2008-04-17. Coins are the most commonly ingested foreign body in children but generally are allowed to pass spontaneously unless the patient is symptomatic.Mark L. Waltzman, MD http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16969175 Current Opinion in Pediatrics Vol. 45 No. 1 Jan–Feb 2006 pp.71–3. Retrieved 2010-2-23. Zinc toxicity, mostly in the form of the ingestion of US pennies minted after 1982, is commonly fatal in dogs where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia.Stowe CM, Nelson R, Werdin R, et al.: Zinc phosphide poisoning in dogs. JAVMA 173:270, 1978 It is also highly toxic in pet parrots and can often be fatal.See, for example, this list of common parrot illnesses and their causes

==Numismatics and regulations==

It has been suggested that the cent should be eliminated as a unit of currency for several reasons including that many Americans do not actually spend them, but rather only receive them in change at stores and proceed to return them to a bank for higher denomination currencies, or cash them in at coin counting kiosks. Most modern vending machines do not accept pennies, further diminishing their utility, and the production cost (figured in U.S. Dollars) now exceeds the face value of the coin, caused by increasing inflation.[tpl]cite news | first=Barbara | last=Hagenbaugh | title=Coins cost more to make than face value | url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/2006-05-09-penny-usat_x.htm | publisher=USA Today | date=2006-05-09 | accessdate=2006-10-04 [/tpl] In 2001 and 2006, for example, United States Representative Jim Kolbe (R) of Arizona introduced bills which would have stopped production of pennies (in 2001, the Legal Tender Modernization Act, and in 2006, the Currency Overhaul for an Industrious Nation COIN Act).[tpl]cite news | first=Christian | last=Zappone | title=Kill-the-penny bill introduced | url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/18/news/penny/index.htm | publisher=CNN Money | date=2006-07-18 | accessdate=2006-10-04 [/tpl]
In anticipation of the business of melting down US pennies and US nickels for profit, the US Mint, which is a part of the US Department of the Treasury, implemented new regulations[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usmint.gov/pressroom/index.cfm?action=press_release&ID=724 |title=United States Mint Moves to Limit Exportation & Melting of Coins |publisher=Usmint.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20[/tpl] on December 14, 2006, which criminalize the melting of pennies and nickels and place limits on export of the coins. Violators can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000 USD and/or imprisoned for a maximum of five years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title31-vol1/pdf/CFR-2010-title31-vol1-part82.pdf |title=CFR 2010 title31 vol1 part82 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |date= |accessdate=2013-01-05[/tpl]

==Metal content and manufacturing costs==

The US Mint reported that in fiscal year 2010 the unit cost of producing and shipping one-cent coins was 1.79 cents—more than the face value of the coin.[tpl]cite web | author=United States Mint | date=2010-12-04 | url=http://www.usmint.gov/downloads/about/annual_report/2010AnnualReport.pdf |format=PDF| title=U.S. Mint 2010 Annual Report | accessdate=2011-01-16[/tpl] After reaching a peak cost of 2.41 cents in 2011 due to the significant rise in global metal demand and prices, recently the cost has declined to 1.83 cents for 2013.[tpl]cite web |title=US Mint Cost To Make Penny and Nickel Declines in FY 2013 |url=http://news.coinupdate.com/us-mint-cost-to-make-cent-and-nickel-declines-3113/ |date=January 20, 2014[/tpl]
When copper reached a record high in February 2011,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/20/markets-metals-idUSL6E8JK8AM20120820 |title=METALS-Copper falls on euro zone disappointment, China worry |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18[/tpl] the melt value of a 95% copper penny was more than three times its face value. As of January 21, 2014, a pre-1982 penny contained 2.20325 cents' worth of copper and zinc, making it an attractive target for melting by people wanting to sell the metals for profit. In comparison, post-1982 copper-plated zinc cents have a metallurgical value of only 0.55152 cents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coinflation.com |title=Current Melt Value Of Coins – How Much Is Your Coin Worth? |publisher=Coinflation.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21[/tpl]
The Secretary of the Treasury currently has authority to alter the percentage of copper and zinc in the one-cent coin if needed due to cost fluctuations.
