Takanori Sugeno (菅野 孝憲, born 3 May 1984 in Fujimi, Saitama, Japan) is a Japanese football player. Although considered short for a goalkeeper, standing at 179 cm, he makes up for his lack of height with superb agility and reflexes. In 2006 he was part of the Yokohama F.C. defense that set a J. League record when they did not concede a goal for 770 consecutive minutes, breaking Shimizu S-Pulse's 731 minutes recorded in 1993. They also kept 7 consecutive clean sheets (which was also a tied J. League Division 2 record) en route to promotion to the J. League Division 1.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|title=Stats Centre: Takanori Sugeno Facts|url=http://guardian.touch-line.com/StatsCentre.asp?CTID=63&CPID=147&TEID=3539&PLID=178766&pStr=Player|accessdate=2010-01-01[/tpl] In 2007 Sugeno was named J-league rookie of the year. In 2008 he was signed by Kashiwa Reysol, a move which some consider unwise as Kashiwa already have a good and relatively young goalkeeper in Yuta Minami.
