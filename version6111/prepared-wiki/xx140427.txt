Point Pleasant was a small village (now extinct) in Pine Township, Warren County, Indiana, located about a mile and a half southwest of Rainsville near the confluence of Big Pine Creek and Mud Pine Creek, a site currently known as Rocky Ford.  It was laid out by one John H. Bartlett and platted July 14, 1830, but never grew, and consisted only of Bartlett's residence, a liquor store and perhaps a saw mill.  An 1883 county history describes Point Pleasant, but notes that "this was a paper town only."
