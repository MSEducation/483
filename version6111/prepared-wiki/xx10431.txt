[[Religion and homosexuality]]

CATEGORIES: LGBT topics and religion, Religious views

The relationship between religion and homosexuality can vary greatly across time and place, within and between different religions and denominations, and regarding different forms of homosexuality and bisexuality. Present day doctrines of the world's major religions vary vastly generally and by denomination on attitudes toward these sexual orientations.
Among those denominations that generally are negative towards these orientations, there are many different types of actions they may take: this can range from quietly discouraging homosexual activity, explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices among adherents and actively opposing social acceptance of homosexuality, to execution. Many argue that it is homosexual actions which are sinful, rather than the state of being homosexual itself. Several organizations exist that assert that conversion therapy can help diminish same-sex attraction.
However, some adherents of many religions view the two sexual orientations positively, and many religious denominations may bless same-sex marriages and support LGBT rights, and the amount of those that do are continuously increasing around the world as much of the developed world enacts laws supporting LGBT rights.
Historically, some cultures and religions accommodated, institutionalized, or revered, same-sex love and sexuality;[tpl]Cite journal | last= Boswell | first= John | publisher= University Of Chicago Press | year= 2005 | title = Christianity, social tolerance, and homosexuality[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | last1= Dynes | first1= Wayne | last2= Donaldson first2= Stephen | title= Asian homosexuality | publisher= Routledge | year= 1992 | postscript= [/tpl] such mythologies and traditions can be found around the world.[tpl]Cite journal | last= Carpenter | first= Edward | title= Intermediate Types among Primitive Types: A Study in Social Evolution | publisher= Mitchell Kennerley | location= New York | year= 1914 | postscript= [/tpl] For example, Hinduism does not view homosexuality as a religious sin.http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/dec/04fire.htm quote - "Hinduism, unlike Christianity and Islam, does not view homosexuality as a religious sin." In 2009, the Hindu Council UK became one of the first major religious organizations to support LGBT rights when they issued a statement "Hinduism does not condemn homosexuality".Rediff.com
Regardless of their position on homosexuality, many people of faith look to both sacred texts and tradition for guidance on this issue. However, the authority of various traditions or scriptural passages and the correctness of translations and interpretations are continually disputed.

==Views of specific religious groups==

===Abrahamic religions===

The Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, have traditionally forbidden sodomy, believing and teaching that such behavior is sinful.Bishop Soto tells NACDLGM: 'Homosexuality is Sinful' catholic.org, accessed 29 September 2008Help topics Assemblies of God (USA), accessed 6 July 2009  Today some denominations within these religions are accepting of homosexuality and inclusive of homosexual people, such as Reform Judaism, the United Church of Christ and the Metropolitan Community Church. Some Presbyterian and Anglican churches welcome members regardless of same-sex sexual practices, with some provinces allowing for the ordination and inclusion of gay and lesbian clerics, and affirmation of same-sex unions. Reform Judaism incorporates lesbian and gay rabbis and same-sex marriage liturgies, while Reconstructionist Judaism and Conservative Judaism in the USA allows for lesbian and gay rabbis and same-sex unions.Conservative Rabbis Allow Ordained Gays, Same-Sex Unions

====Judaism====

The Torah (first five books of the Hebrew Bible) is the primary source for Jewish views on homosexuality. It states that: "man shall not lie with another man as would with a woman, it is a תועבה toeba ("abomination")" (Leviticus 18:22). (Like many similar commandments, the stated punishment for willful violation is the death penalty, although in practice rabbinic Judaism no longer believes it has the authority to implement death penalties.)
Orthodox Judaism views homosexual acts as sinful. In recent years, there has been approaches claiming only the sexual anal act is forbidden and considered abomination by the Torah, while the sexual orientation and even other sexual activities are not considered a sin. Conservative Judaism has engaged in an in-depth study of homosexuality since the 1990s with various rabbis presenting a wide array of responsa (papers with legal arguments) for communal consideration. The official position of the movement is to welcome homosexual Jews into their synagogues, and also campaign against any discrimination in civil law and public society, but also to uphold a ban on anal sex as a religious requirement.
Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism in North America and Liberal Judaism in the United Kingdom view homosexuality to be acceptable on the same basis as heterosexuality. Progressive Jewish authorities believe either that traditional laws against homosexuality are no longer binding or that they are subject to changes that reflect a new understanding of human sexuality. Some of these authorities rely on modern biblical scholarship suggesting that the prohibition in the Torah was intended to ban coercive or ritualized homosexual sex, such as those practices ascribed to Egyptian and Canaanite fertility cults and temple prostitution.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]Liberals recognize committed same-sex partnership

====Christianity====

Christian denominations hold a variety of views on the issue of homosexual activity, ranging from outright condemnation to complete acceptance. Most Christian denominations welcome people attracted to the same sex, but teach that homosexual acts are sinful.[tpl]cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1728| title = Human Sexuality|publisher = The United Methodist Church|accessdate = 2008-05-16[/tpl]"Catechism of the Catholic Church" These denominations include the Roman Catholic Church,Catechism of the Catholic Church, § 2357,Criteria for the Discernment of Vocation for Persons with Homosexual Tendencies the Eastern Orthodox church,On Marriage, Family, Sexuality, and the Sanctity of Life the United Methodist Church,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/issues/4957.htm|title=Stances of Faiths on LGBT Issues: African Methodist Episcopal Church|publisher=The Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=2009-11-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freemethodistchurch.org/Sections/About%20Us/Beliefs/Christian%20Life/Christian%20Conduct/Christian%20Conduct%203.htm|title=The Christian Life - Christian Conduct|publisher=Free Methodist Church|accessdate=2008-05-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/site/c.gjJTJbMUIuE/b.1827285/k.B985/British_Methodists_reject_blessing_of_samesex_relationships.htm|title=British Methodists reject blessing of same-sex relationships|publisher=The United Methodist Church|accessdate=2007-05-16[/tpl] and some other mainline denominations, such as the Reformed Church in America[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rca.org/Page.aspx?pid=501|title=Summaries of General Synod Discussions and Actions on Homosexuality and the Rights of Homosexuals|publisher=Reformed Church in America|accessdate=2009-11-21[/tpl] and the American Baptist Church,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc-usa.org/WhoWeAre/Identity/IdentityStatement/tabid/78/Default.aspx|title=We Are American Baptists|publisher=American Baptist Churches USA|accessdate=2009-11-21[/tpl] as well as Conservative Evangelical organizations and churches, such as the Evangelical Alliance,Evangelical Alliance (UK): Faith, Hope and Homosexuality and fundamentalist groups and churches, such as the Southern Baptist Convention.Position Statements/SexualityStatement on HomosexualityPosition Paper on Homosexuality Pentecostal churches such as the Assemblies of God,Homosexuality as well as Restorationist churches, like Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons, also take the position that homosexual sexual activity is sinful.Homosexuality —How Can I Avoid It?Same-Gender Attraction - LDS Newsroom
Some liberal Christians are supportive of homosexuals. Other Christian denominations do not view monogamous same sex relationships as bad or evil. These include the United Church of Canada, the United Church of Christ,NYTimes.com "United Church of Christ Backs Same-Sex Marriage" the Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. In particular, the Metropolitan Community Church, a denomination of 40,000 members, was founded specifically to serve the Christian LGBT community, and is devoted to being open and affirming to LGBT people.  The United Church of Christ and the Alliance of Baptists also condone gay marriage, and some parts of the Anglican and Lutheran churches allow for the blessing of gay unions.  Within the Anglican communion there are openly gay clergy; for example, Gene Robinson and Mary Glasspool are openly homosexual bishops in the US Episcopal Church and Eva Brunne in Lutheran Church of Sweden.  The Episcopal Church's recent actions vis-a-vis homosexuality have brought about increased ethical debate and tension within the Church of England and worldwide Anglican churches.
Passages from the Old Testament have been interpreted to argue that homosexuals should be punished with death, and AIDS has been portrayed by some fundamentalist sects such as Fred Phelps and Jerry FalwellJerry Falwell as a punishment by God against homosexuals.Bass, Ellen and Kate Kaufman. Free Your Mind: The Book for Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Youth and their Allies. New York: HarperPerennial, 1996. In the 20th century, theologians like Karl Barth, Jürgen Moltmann, Hans Küng, John Robinson, Bishop David Jenkins, Don Cupitt, Bishop Jack Spong challenged traditional theological positions and understandings of the Bible; following these developments some have suggested that passages have been mistranslated, are taken out of context, or that they do not refer to what we understand as "homosexuality."See generally Religioustolerance.org and subpages therein.Homosexuality and the Bible, Rev. Clay Witt, Holy Redeemer M.C.C., 1995
Some Protestant churches condemn same-sex sexual relations, based on scripture texts such as describing a man lying with another man (Leviticus [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|18:22|[/tpl]), or (Romans[tpl]bibleverse-nb||Romans|1:26-27|[/tpl]) as sinful acts. Where the Catholic view is founded on a natural law argument informed by scripture and proposed by Thomas Aquinas,Catechism of the Catholic Church vatican.va, accessed 13 June 2009 the traditional conservative Protestant view is based on an interpretation of scripture alone. Protestant conservatives also see homosexual relationships as an impediment to heterosexual relationships. They interpret some Biblical passages to be commandments to be heterosexually married.Sheri L. Dew, "It Is Not Good for Man or Woman to Be Alone", ''Ensign, November 2001.  Catholics, on the other hand, have accommodated unmarried people as priests, monks, nuns and single lay people for over a thousand years.  A number of self-described gay and 'ex-gay' Christians have reported satisfaction in mixed-orientation marriages.

=====Catholic Church=====

The Catholic Church insists that those who are attracted to people of the same sex as well as anyone who is not married practice chastity."Catechism of the Catholic Church", see the "Chastity and homosexuality" section. The Catholic Church does not regard homosexual activity as a perfect expression of the marital sacrament which it teaches is only possible within a lifelong commitment of a marriage between a man and a woman. According to the Church's sexual ethics, homosexual activity falls short in the areas complementarity (male and female organs complement each other) and fecundity (openness to new life) of the sexual act. This is not to be seen as a fault of people with homosexual attraction, but rather Catholic church officials consider this to be a statement of fact about reality."Homosexuality in the eyes of the Catholic Church"

=====Mormonism=====

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that no one should arouse sexual feelings outside of marriage, including those towards members of the same sex."Chastity", lds.org The LDS church recognizes that feelings of same-sex attraction may not change or be overcome in this earth life, and expect all un-married members, gay or straight, to abstain from any and all sexual relations outside of heterosexual marriage.http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/the-divine-institution-of-marriage The LDS church maintains that feelings and inclinations toward the same sex (i.e. homosexual feelings or "temptations") are not inherently sinful, but engaging in homosexual behavior is in conflict with the “doctrinal principle, based on sacred scripture … that marriage between a man and a woman is essential to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children.” http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/first-presidency-statement-on-same-gender-marriage Those who experience same-sex attraction should continually exercise self-control and reliance on the atonement of Jesus Christ in order to refrain from acting on such feelings."God Loveth His Children", 2007.LDS Church (1992) Understanding and Helping Those Who Have Homosexual Problems: Suggestions for Ecclesiastical Leaders Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church. The LDS church strongly opposes same-sex marriage and teaches that marriage is only to be between a man and a woman, and that this is essential to God's eternal plan.http://lds.org/family/proclamation 
For more information on this subject, see the LDS Church's website “Love One Another: A Discussion on Same-Sex Attraction”.mormonsandgays.org This site strives to address, through interviews and videos from Church leaders and members, the issue of same-sex attraction as it relates to individuals and affected family members.

====Islam====

All major Islamic schools disapprove of homosexuality,See, for example, this website Islam views same-sex desires as a natural temptation; but, sexual relations are seen as a transgression of the natural role and aim of sexual activity."Homosexuality in the Light of Islam", September 20, 2003 Islamic teachings (in the hadith tradition) presume same-sex attraction, extol abstention and (in the Qur'an) condemn consummation.
The discourse on homosexuality in Islam is primarily concerned with activities between men. There are, however, a few hadith mentioning homosexual behavior in women; The fuqaha’ are agreed that "there is no hadd punishment for lesbianism, because it is not zina. Rather a ta’zeer punishment must be imposed, because it is a sin..'".Islamqa.com Although punishment for lesbianism is rarely mentioned in the histories, al-Tabari records an example of the casual execution of a pair of lesbian slavegirls in the harem of al-Hadi, in a collection of highly critical anecdotes pertaining to that Caliph's actions as ruler.[tpl]cite book|last=Bosworth|first=C.E.|title=The History of al-Tabari Vol. 30: The 'Abbasid Caliphate in Equilibrium: The Caliphates of Musa al-Hadi and Harun al-Rashid A.D. 785-809/A.H. 169-193|year=1989|publisher=SUNY Press|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wqf1gwM9O58C&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=Tabari+lesbian+Caliph+al-Hadi&source=bl&ots=BEsfAzmpXj&sig=euUAWk4eDKk4Q0pxtRgx5Uo-ZMo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nooiUr7BGcTxhQff9oGQBQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Tabari%20lesbian%20Caliph%20al-Hadi&f=false[/tpl]
Islam allows and promotes filial love between siblings of the same sex. However, sexual activities between them are totally prohibited. Ibn Hazm, Ibn Daud, Al-Mutamid, Abu Nuwas and many others used this edict to write extensively and openly of brotherly love between men while proclaiming to be chaste.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

====Bahá'í Faith====

Bahá'í law limits permissible sexual relations to those between a man and a woman in marriage. Believers are expected to abstain from sex outside matrimony.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Bahá'ís do not, however, attempt to impose their moral standards on those who have not accepted the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] While requiring uprightness in all matters of morality, whether sexual or otherwise, the Bahá’í teachings also take account of human frailty and call for tolerance and understanding in regard to human failings. In this context, to regard homosexuals with prejudice would be contrary to the spirit of the Bahá’í teachings.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

===Indian religions===

Among the religions that originated in India, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, teachings regarding homosexuality are less clear than among the Abrahamic traditions, and religious authorities voice diverse opinions. In 2005, an authority figure of Sikhism condemned same-sex marriage and the practice of homosexuality. However many people in Sikhism aren't against gay marriage.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/03/28/sikhguy-050328.html |title=World Sikh group against gay marriage bill |work=CBC News |date=29 March 2005[/tpl] Hinduism is diverse, with no supreme governing body, but the majority of swamis opposed same-sex relationships in a 2004 survey, and a minority supported them.[tpl]cite journal|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110726045115/http://www.faithandthecity.org/issues/social/articles/Discussions_on_Dharma%20.shtml |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url=http://www.faithandthecity.org/issues/social/articles/Discussions_on_Dharma%20.shtml |title=Discussions on Dharma |first=Rajiv |last=Malik |work=Hinduism Today Magazine |date=October/November/December 2004[/tpl] Ancient religious texts such as the Vedas often refer to people of a third gender known as hijra, who are neither female nor male. Some see this third gender as an ancient parallel to modern western lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and/or intersex identities. However, this third sex is usually negatively valued as a pariah class in ancient texts.Gyatso, Janet (2003). One Plus One Makes Three: Buddhist Gender Conceptions and the Law of the Non-Excluded Middle, History of Religions. 2003, no. 2. University of Chicago press. Ancient Hindu law books, from the first century onward, categorize non-vaginal sex (ayoni) as impure.HRC | Page Not Found

====Hinduism====

Hinduism has taken various positions, ranging from positive to neutral or antagonistic. Referring to the nature of Samsara,the Rigveda,one of the four canonical sacred texts of Hinduism says 'Vikruti Evam Prakriti' (perversity/diversity is what nature is all about, or, what seems un-natural is also natural).'Expose the Hindu Taliban!' by Ashok Row Kavi Sexuality is rarely discussed openly in Hindu society, and LGBT issues are largely a taboo subject — especially among the strongly religious.  A "third gender" has been acknowledged within Hinduism since Vedic times. Several Hindu texts, such as Manu SmritiManu Smriti, 3.49 and Sushruta Samhita, assert that some people are born with either mixed male and female natures, or sexually neuter, as a matter of natural biology. They worked as hairdressers, flower-sellers, servants, masseurs and prostitutes. Today, many people of a "third gender" (hijras) live throughout India, mostly on the margins of society.
Several Hindu religious laws contain injunctions against homosexual activity, while some Hindu theories doesn't condemn lesbian relations and some third-gendered individuals were highly regarded. Hindu groups are historically not unifyed regarding the issue of homosexuality, each one having a distinct doctrinal view.Lariviere. Naradasmriti, (Part One). Philadelphia, 1989.[tpl]harvnb|Vanita|Kidwai|2001|p=25[/tpl]Mahabharata, book 5, Chapter 191-5.
The Indian Kama Sutra, written in the 150 BC,http://www.gradesaver.com/author/vatsyayana/ contains passages describing eunuchs or "third-sex" males performing oral sex on men.Kama Sutra, Chapter 9, "Of the Auparishtaka or Mouth Congress". Text online.Pattanaik, Devdutt (2001). Homosexuality in Ancient India, Debonair 2000 or 2001. Essay available online from GayBombay.org.  Similarly, some medieval Hindu temples and artifacts openly depict both male homosexuality and lesbianism within their carvings, such as the temple walls at Khajuraho. Some infer from these images that at least part of the Hindu society and religion were previously more open to variations in human sexuality than they are at present.
In some Hindu sects (specially among the hijras), many divinities are androgynous. There are Hindu deities who are intersex (both male and female); who manifest in all three genders; who switch from male to female or from female to male; male deities with female moods and female deities with male moods; deities born from two males or from two females; deities born from a single male or single female; deities who avoid the opposite sex; deities with principal companions of the same sex, and so on.  However, this is not accepted by the majority of Hindus, and is often considered heretical in nature.  Those who do accept it justify with the belief that both God and nature are unlimitedly diverse and God is difficult to comprehend.
On July 2012 Gopi Shankar, a Gender activist and a student from The American College in Madurai coined the regional terms for genderqueer people in Tamil, Gopi said apart from male and female, there are more than 20 types of genders, such as transwoman, transmen, androgynous, pangender, trigender,, etc., and ancient India refers it as Trithiya prakirthi. After English, Tamil is the only language that has been given names for all the genders identified so far.V Mayilvaganan (July 30, 2012).

====Buddhism====

The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics are the Five Precepts and the Eightfold Path, one should neither be attached to nor crave sensual pleasure. The third of the Five Precepts is "To refrain from committing sexual misconduct." However, "sexual misconduct" is such a broad term, and is subjected to interpretation relative to the social norms of the followers. In fact, Buddhism in its earliest form did not clearly define sexuality rules for lay followers, restricting the subject mostly for monks. Therefore the determination of whether or not homosexuality is acceptable for a layperson is not considered a religious matter by many Buddhists.GLBT in World Religions, Sermon by Rev. Gabriele Parks, along with Phil Manos and Bill Weber. Tpuuf.org
Buddhism is often characterized as distrustful of sensual enjoyment and sexuality in general.[tpl]cite journal |last=Jackson |first=Peter Anthony |date=December 1995 |title=Thai Buddhist accounts of male homosexuality and AIDS in the 1980s |journal=The Australian Journal of Anthropology |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=140–53  |url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-EPT/anth.htm |doi=10.1111/j.1835-9310.1995.tb00276.x |pmid=12291560[/tpl]  Traditionally, homosexual conduct and gender variance are seen as obstacles to spiritual progress in most schools of Buddhism; as such monks are expected to refrain from all sexual activity, and the Vinaya (the first book of the Tripitaka) specifically prohibits sexual intercourse, then further explain that both anal, oral as well as vaginal intercourse amount to sexual intercourse, which will result in permanent exclusion from Sangha.See, for example, the Pandakavatthu section of the Mahavagga. 1:61, 68, 69; Vinaya: Mahavagga, 1:71, 76. Additionally, "The Story of the Prohibition of the Ordination of Pandaka" justifies the ban by giving an example of a monk with an insatiable desire to be sexually penetrated by men, thus bringing shame upon the Buddhist community. Vinaya, Vol. 4, pp. 141–142.  A notable exception in the history of Buddhism occurred in Japan during the Edo period, in which male homosexuality, or more specifically, love between young novices and older monks, was celebrated.[tpl]cite book |first=Gary P. |last=Leupp |year=1995 |title=Male Colors, the Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan |location=Berkeley |publisher=The University of California Press |isbn=0-585-10603-7[/tpl]
References to pandaka, a deviant sex/gender category that is usually interpreted to include homosexual males, can be found throughout the Pali canon as well as other Sanskrit scriptures.[tpl]cite book |last=Zwilling |first=Leonard |year=1992 |chapter=Homosexuality As Seen In Indian Buddhist Texts |editor=Cabezon, Jose Ignacio (ed.) |title=Buddhism, Sexuality & Gender |publisher=State University of New York |pages=203–214[/tpl] Leonard Zwilling refers extensively to Buddhaghosa's Samantapasadika, where pandaka are described as being filled with defiled passions and insatiable lusts, and are dominated by their libido. Some texts of the Abhidharma state that a pandaka cannot achieve enlightenment in their own lifetime, (but must wait for rebirth as a "normal" man or woman) and Asanga and Vasubandhu discussed if a pandaka was able to be enlightened or not. According to one scriptural story, Ananda—Buddha's cousin and disciple—was a pandaka in one of his many previous lives.
Some later classic Buddhist masters and texts (from both Theravada and Mahayana schools) disallow contact between Buddhists and pandakas and classify homosexuality as sexual misconduct, including for lay followers.AbhidharmakośaCutler/Newland The Great Treatise On The Stages Of The Path To Enlightnment p.220[tpl]cite book| last = harvey | first = peter | title = An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780511800801 | pages=421-[/tpl]http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1999&m=5&p=25_1Lotus Sutra: Leon Hurvitz, trans., Scripture of the Lotus Blossom of the Fine Dharma (New York: Columbia University Press, 1976), p. 209Milinda Panha, 100 BC. p. 310.
The third of the Five Precepts of Buddhism states that one is to refrain from sexual misconduct; this precept has sometimes been interpreted to include homosexuality. The Dalai Lama of Tibetan Buddhism interprets sexual misconduct to include lesbian and gay sex, and indeed any sex other than penis-vagina intercourse, including oral sex, anal sex, and masturbation or other sexual activity with the hand; the only time sex is acceptable is when it performed for its natural purpose of procreation.[tpl]cite news |title=Dalai Lama Speaks on Gay Sex - He says it's wrong for Buddhists but not for society |first=Don |last=Lattin |date=1997-06-11 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle [/tpl] – [tpl]cite news |title=Dalai Lama urges 'respect, compassion, and full human rights for all,' including gays |first=Dennis |last=Conkin |date=1997-06-19 |url=http://quietmountain.org/links/teachings/gayrites.htm[/tpl] – [tpl]cite news |title=Dalai Lama says 'oral and anal sex' not acceptable |first=Jack |last=Nichols |date=1997-05-13 |url=http://badpuppy.com/gaytoday/garchive/events/051397ev.htm[/tpl] When interviewed by Canadian TV news anchor Evan Solomon on CBC News: Sunday about whether or not homosexuality is acceptable in Buddhism, the Dalai Lama responded that "it is sexual misconduct."The Huffington Post, 07/13/09, Gay Marriage: What Would Buddha Do?, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-shaheen/gay-marriage-what-would-b_b_230855.html This was an echo of an earlier response in a 2004 Vancouver Sun interview when asked about homosexulity in Buddhism, where the Dalai Lama replied "for a Buddhist, the same sex, that is sexual misconduct".LifeSiteNews, 11/02/07/, The Dalai Lama, Like the Pope, Says Gay Sex is “Sexual Misconduct”, http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/archive/ldn/2007/nov/07110208 However, the Dalai Lama supports human rights for all, "regardless of sexual orientation."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_budd.htm |title=The Buddhist religion and homosexuality |publisher=Religioustolerance.org[/tpl]
In Thailand, traditional accounts propose that "homosexuality arises as a karmic consequence of violating Buddhist proscriptions against heterosexual misconduct. These karmic accounts describe homosexuality as a congenital condition which cannot be altered, at least in a homosexual person's current lifetime, and have been linked with calls for compassion and understanding from the non-homosexual populace." However, Buddhist leaders in Thailand have also condemned homosexuality,Ibid. ousted monks accused of homosexual acts, and banned kathoey from ordination. As per BBC article April 27, 2009, Senior monk Phra Maha Wudhijaya Vajiramedh is very concerned by flamboyant behavior of gay and transgender novices such as the wearing of make-up and tight or revealingly tight robes, carrying pink purses and having effeminately-shaped eyebrows. Phra Vajiramedhi acknowledged that it was difficult to exclude them from the monkhood - so he introduced Thailand's & Buddhism's "good manners" curriculum - the country's first.
A later Popular Japanese legend attributed the introduction of monastic homosexuality to Japan to Shingon founder Kukai, although scholars now dismiss the veracity of this assertion, pointing out his strict adherence to the Vinaya.Leupp, Gary (1995). Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan. p. 31Faure, Bernard (1998). The Red Thread: Buddhist approches to sexuality p. 209Schalow, Paul Gordon. "Kukai and the Tradition of Male Love in Japanese Buddhism," in Cabezon, Jose Ignacio, Ed., Buddhism, Sexuality & Gender, State University of New York. p. 215. Nonetheless, the legend served to "affirm same sex relation between men and boys in seventeenth century Japan."

Although Mahayana Buddhism has texts opposing homosexuality, the majority of its teachings assert that all beings who correctly practice the dharma may reach enlightenment, since all possess an innate Buddha nature. Enlightenment being achievable even in a single life.Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. pp. 152[tpl]harvnb|Reeves|2008|p=5[/tpl]
The capacity of Buddhism to reform itself and its great variety of distinct beliefs and schools, provide many liberal streams of Buddhism, which are accepting of all sexual orientations. Reformist Buddhism is predominant in the west and in some eastern cosmopolitan cities.

====Sikhism====

Sikhism has no written view on the matter, but in 2005, a Sikh religious authority described homosexuality as "against the Sikh religion and the Sikh code of conduct and totally against the laws of nature," and called on Sikhs to support laws against gay marriage.World Sikh group against gay marriage bill, CBC News, Tuesday, 29 March 2005. Many Sikhs are against this view, however,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sarbat.net/2007/10/sikhism-and-same-sex-marriages/|title=Sikhism and same Sex Marriages|first=Admin|publisher=sarbat.net|page=1|accessdate=3 September 2010|archiveurl=http://www.sarbat.net/2007/10/sikhism-and-same-sex-marriages/|archivedate=3 October 2007[/tpl] and state that the Sikh Scriptures promote equality and do not condemn homosexuality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projectnaad.com/wp-content/uploads/leaflets/sikhism_yoga_and_sexuality.pdf|title=Sikhism, Yoga and Sexuality|last=Naad|first=Project|date=2/9/2010|publisher=Project Naad|page=33|accessdate=2 September 2010|archiveurl=http://www.projectnaad.com/wp-content/uploads/leaflets/sikhism_yoga_and_sexuality.pdf|archivedate=2 September 2010[/tpl]

===Zoroastrianism===

The Vendidad, one of the later Zoroastrian texts composed in the Artificial Young Avestan language, has not been dated precisely. It is thought that some concepts of law, uncleanliness, dualism, and salvation were shared between the religions,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cais-soas*com/CAIS/Religions/non-iranian/judaism/persian_judaism/book2/pt4.htm|title=How Persia created Judaism:Zoroastrian Influences on Judaism and Christianity (Part II) - Zoroastrianism: Theology[/tpl] and subsequent interactions between the religions are documented by events such as the release of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity by Zoroastrian Cyrus the Great in 537 BC, and the Biblical account of the Magi visiting the infant Jesus.  The Vendidad generally promotes procreation: "the man who has a wife is far above him who lives in continence; he who keeps a house is far above him who has none; he who has children is far above the childless man; he who has riches is far above him who has none."  It details the penance for a worshipper who submits to sodomy under force as "Eight hundred stripes with the Aspahe-astra, eight hundred stripes with the Sraosho-charana." (equal to the penalty for breaking a contract with the value of an ox),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd4sbe.htm|title=Avesta: Vendidad (English): Fargard 4. Contracts and offenses[/tpl] and declares that for those participating voluntarily "For that deed there is nothing that can pay, nothing that can atone, nothing that can cleanse from it; it is a trespass for which there is no atonement, for ever and ever".  However, those not practicing the Religion of Mazda were pardoned for past actions upon conversion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd8sbe.htm|title=Avesta: Vendidad: Fargard 8.

===Chinese religions===

Among the Taoic religions of East Asia, such as Taoism, passionate homosexual expression is usually discouraged because it is believed to not lead to human fulfillment.Wawrytko, Sandra (1993). Homosexuality and Chinese and Japanese Religions in "Homosexuality and World Religions", edited by Arlene Swidler. Trinity Press International, 1993.

====Confucianism====

Confucianism, being primarily a social and political philosophy, focused little on sexuality, whether homosexual or heterosexual. However, the ideology did emphasize male friendships, and Louis Crompton has argued that the "closeness of the master-disciple bond it fostered may have subtly facilitated homosexuality".Crompton, Louis. Homosexuality and Civilization. Harvard University Press. p. 221 Homosexuality is not mentioned in the Analects of Confucius.Jeffrey S. Siker, Homosexuality and Religion: an encyclopedia. page 210. 2007. ISBN 0-313-33088-3  "Biting the bitter peel", a euphemism for homosexual relations, generally taken to mean anal sex, is mentioned as having been practiced by several individuals in the Classic of History as well as the Spring and Autumn Annals,[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl] both texts belonging to the Five Classics.

====Taoism====

There is no single official position on homosexuality in Taoism, as the term Taoism is used to describe a number of disparate religious traditions. In a similar way to Buddhism, Taoist schools sought throughout history to define what would be sexual misconduct. Consequently, the literature of some schools included homosexuality as one of the forms of sexual misconduct.The Ultra Supreme Elder Lord's Scripture of Precepts(太上老君戒經), in "The Orthodox Tao Store" (正統道藏).The Great Dictionary of Taoism (道教大辭典), by Chinese Taoism Association, published in China in 1994, ISBN 7-5080-0112-5/B.054 However, homosexuality is not unknown in Taoist history, such as during the Tang dynasty when Taoist nuns exchanged love poems.Homosexuality in China on glbtq.com.  Attitudes about homosexuality within Taoism often reflect the values and sexual norms of broader Chinese society (see Homosexuality in China).

===Paganism===

===Neopagan religion===

====Wicca====

The Wiccan Charge of the Goddess, one of the most famous texts in Neopaganism, states in the words of the Goddess, "all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals".[tpl]cite web |title=Alternative Sexuality |publisher=Tangled Moon Coven |date=2006-08-08 |url=http://www.tangledmoon.org/sexuality.htm |accessdate=2006-12-30 [/tpl] In traditional forms of Wicca, such as Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca, magic is often performed between a man and a woman, and the "Great Rite" is a sex ritual performed between a Priest and Priestess representing the God and Goddess;[tpl]cite journal |title=Sex, Wicca and the Great Rite |journal=The Blade & Chalice |volume=Spring 1993 |issue=3 [/tpl] however, this is not generally seen as excluding homosexuals or magic between same-sex couples. Most groups still insist, however, that initiations be conferred from man to woman or woman to man. Any ritual sexual acts, whether actual or symbolic, take place between two consenting adults, normally a couple who are already lovers. See also LGBT topics and Wicca.

===Satanism===

Satanism, in the LaVey tradition, is open to all forms of sexual expression, and does not preclude homosexuality.

===Unitarian Universalism===

The Unitarian Universalist Association supports the freedom to marryUUA.org and compares resistance to it to the resistance to abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, and the end of anti-miscegenation laws.UUSM - Services & Sermons Several congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a "Welcoming Congregation": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual & transgender (GLBT) members. UU ministers perform same-sex unions and now same-sex marriages where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church "to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions." Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men and lesbians are also regularly ordained as ministers, and a number of gay and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, Arlington Street Church was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage—"Standing on the Side of Love." In 2004 UU Minister Rev. Debra Haffner of The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing published An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective.

===Humanism===

Humanism is a lifestance that supports full equality for LGBTQ individuals http://iheu.org/content/homosexual-rightshttp://lgbthumanists.org/about/ including the right to marry.http://www.americanhumanist.org/news/details/2013-02-humanists-tell-supreme-court-marriage-equality-is-thhttp://humanist-society.org/for-celebrants/resources/ Humanism and Its Aspirations, a statement of humanist principles from the American Humanist Association, states that "humanists are concerned for the well being of all, are committed to diversity, and respect those of differing yet humane views...work to uphold the equal enjoyment of human rights and civil liberties in an open, secular society and maintain it is a civic duty to participate in the democratic process and a planetary duty to protect nature's integrity, diversity, and beauty in a secure, sustainable manner."http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III The American Humanist Association provides a LGBT Humanist Pride award http://lgbthumanists.org/blog/aha-awards-greta-christina-lgbt-humanist-of-the-year-award/ and has funded a LGBT-inclusive prom.http://www.secularnewsdaily.com/2010/05/second-chance-prom-in-mississippi-great-success-humanists-say/ The Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association from the U.K. promotes “an awareness and understanding of the Humanist ethical outlook, bringing lesbian and gay rights issues to the attention of the public, and playing a full part in the campaign for lesbian and gay equality,” http://www.lgbthistoryuk.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gay_and_Lesbian_Humanist_Association and in 2009 they gave Stephen Fry an award “for his services to humanism and gay rights.” http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2009/11/16/stephen-fry-wins-gay-humanist-award/ The Galha LGBT Humanists "is a United Kingdom-based not-for-profit that campaigns for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) equality and human rights and promotes Humanism as an ethical worldview."Galha LGBT Humanists

==Queer religions==

===Radical Faeries===

The Radical Faeries are a worldwide queer spiritual movement, founded in 1979 in the United States.

==Religious groups and public policy==

Opposition to same-sex marriage and LGBT rights is often associated with conservative religious views. The American Family Association and other religious groups have promoted boycotts of corporations whose policies support the LGBT community.
In conservative Islamic nations, laws generally prohibit same-sex sexual behaviour, and interpretation of Sharia Law on male homosexuality carries the death penalty.  This has been condemned as a violation of human rights by human rights organisation Amnesty International and by the writers of the Yogyakarta principles.  With the signature of the USA in 2009, the proposed UN declaration on LGBT rights has now been signed by every European secular state and all western nations, as well as other countries—67 members of the UN in total.  An opposing statement put forward by Muslim nations was signed by 57 member states, mostly in Africa and Asia.  68 out of the total 192 countries have not yet signed either statement. In 2011 the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a landmark resolution initiated by South Africa supporting LBGT rights (See Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity at the United Nations)
