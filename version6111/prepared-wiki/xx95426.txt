[[Glucosamine]]

CATEGORIES: Hexosamines, Dietary supplements

Glucosamine (C6H13NO5) is an amino sugar and a prominent precursor in the biochemical synthesis of glycosylated proteins and lipids. Glucosamine is part of the structure of the polysaccharides chitosan and chitin, which compose the exoskeletons of crustaceans and other arthropods, as well as the cell walls of fungi and many higher organisms. Glucosamine is one of the most abundant monosaccharides. It is produced commercially by the hydrolysis of crustacean exoskeletons or, less commonly, by fermentation of a grain such as corn or wheat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.devanutrition.com/easyfaq/cat/Glucosamine-Hcl/63.html|title=Vegan Glucosamine FAQ|accessdate=2010-12-08[/tpl] In the US it is one of the most common non-vitamin, non-mineral, dietary supplements used by adults.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2008/nhsr12.pdf|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults and Children: United States, 2007|date=December 10, 2008|publisher=National Center for Health Statistics|accessdate=2009-08-16[/tpl]

==Biochemistry==

Glucosamine is naturally present in the shells of shellfish, animal bones, bone marrow, and fungi.[tpl]cite journal |title=Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Dietetic Products Nutrition and Allergies on a request from the European Commission on the safety of glucosamine hydrochloride from Aspergillus niger as food ingredient |journal=The EFSA Journal |volume=1099 |pages=1–19 |year=2009 |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/scdoc/1099.htm[/tpl]
Glucosamine was first prepared in 1876 by Georg Ledderhose by the hydrolysis of chitin with concentrated hydrochloric acid.[tpl]cite journal|author=Georg Ledderhose |year=1876 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hltBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1200#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Über salzsaures Glycosamin |trans_title=On glucosamine hydrochloride |journal=Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=1200–1201|doi=10.1002/cber.18760090251[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Ledderhose G |authorlink =Georg Ledderhose|year = 1878–9|journal = Zeitschrift für physiologische Chemie |title = Über Chitin und seine Spaltungs-produkte |trans_title=On chitin and its hydrolysis products |volume = ii |pages = 213–227 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Ledderhose G |authorlink = Georg Ledderhose|year = 1880 |journal = Zeitschrift für physiologische Chemie|title = Über Glykosamin|volume = iv |pages = 139–159[/tpl]  The stereochemistry was not fully determined until the 1939 work of Walter Haworth.[ref]
