The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference is the debut book by Malcolm Gladwell, first published by Little Brown in 2000.
Gladwell defines a tipping point as "the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point".Gladwell, p. 12  The book seeks to explain and describe the "mysterious" sociological changes that mark everyday life.  As Gladwell states, "Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread like viruses do".Gladwell, p. 7 The examples of such changes in his book include the rise in popularity and sales of Hush Puppies shoes in the mid-1990s and the steep drop in the New York City crime rate after 1990.

==The three rules==

Malcolm Gladwell describes the "three rules of epidemics" (or the three "agents of change") in the tipping points of epidemics.

===The Law of the Few===

"The Law of the Few", or, as Malcolm Gladwell states, "The success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts".Gladwell, p. 33  According to Malcolm Gladwell, economists call this the "80/20 Principle, which is the idea that in any situation roughly 80 percent of the 'work' will be done by 20 percent of the participants".Gladwell, p. 19 (see Pareto Principle) These people are described in the following ways:

===The Stickiness Factor===

The specific content of a message that renders its impact memorable. Popular children's television programs such as Sesame Street and Blue's Clues pioneered the properties of the stickiness factor, thus enhancing the effective retention of the educational content in tandem with its entertainment value.

===The Power of Context===

Human behavior is sensitive to and strongly influenced by its environment. As Malcolm Gladwell says, "Epidemics are sensitive to the conditions and circumstances of the times and places in which they occur".Gladwell, p. 139.  For example, "zero tolerance" efforts to combat minor crimes such as fare-beating and vandalism on the New York subway led to a decline in more violent crimes city-wide. Gladwell describes the bystander effect, and explains how Dunbar's number plays into the tipping point, using Rebecca Wells' novel Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, evangelist John Wesley, and the high-tech firm W. L. Gore and Associates. Malcolm Gladwell also discusses what he dubs the rule of 150, which states that the maximum number of individuals in a society or group that someone can have real social relationships with is 150.Gladwell, p. 179

==Other key concepts==

Gladwell also includes two chapters of case studies, situations in which tipping point concepts were used in specific situations.  These situations include the athletic shoe company Airwalk, the diffusion model, how rumors are spread, decreasing the spread of syphilis in Baltimore, teen suicide in Micronesia, and teen smoking in the United States.

==Reception==

===Public===

Malcolm Gladwell and his co-partner, John Decker, both received an estimated US$1–1.5 million advance for The Tipping Point, which sold 1.7 million copies by 2006.[tpl]cite web |accessdate=2009-01-17 |url=http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2000/03/17/gladwell/index.html |title=Idea epidemics |publisher=Salon.com |date=2000-03-17 |author=McNett, Gavin [/tpl] In the wake of the book's success, Gladwell was able to earn as much as $40,000 per lecture.Andrew Potter, "A Backwards Glance at Gladwell", MacLeans, June 12, 2009 Sales increased again in 2006 after the release of Gladwell's next book, Blink.[tpl]cite web |accessdate=2009-01-17 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/books/review/05donadio.html |title=The Gladwell Effect |work=New York Times |date=5 February 2006 |author=Donadio, Rachel [/tpl]

===Scientific===

Some of Malcolm Gladwell's analysis as to why the phenomenon of the "tipping point" occurs (particularly in relation to his idea of the "law of the few") and its unpredictable elements[tpl]cite web |url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2027 |title= The Tipping Point (review) |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2011-10-10[/tpl] is based on the 1967 small-world experiment by social psychologist Stanley Milgram. Milgram distributed letters to 160 students in Nebraska, with instructions that they be sent to a stockbroker in Boston (not personally known to them) by passing the letters to anyone else that they believed to be socially closer to the target. The study found that it took an average of six links to deliver each letter. Of particular interest to Gladwell was the finding that just three friends of the stockbroker provided the final link for half of the letters that arrived successfully.[tpl]cite journal | last = Travers | first = Jeffrey | coauthors = Stanley Milgram | title = An Experimental Study of the Small World Problem | journal = Sociometry | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 425–443 | date = December 1969| doi = 10.2307/2786545 | jstor = 2786545[/tpl]  This gave rise to Gladwell's theory that certain types of people are key to the dissemination of information.
In 2003, Duncan Watts, a network theory physicist at Columbia University, repeated the Milgram study by using a web site to recruit 61,000 people to send messages to 18 targets worldwide.[tpl]cite news | last = Chang | first = Kenneth | title = With e-mail, it's not easy to navigate 6 degrees of separation | work = New York Times | date = 2003-08-12 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E3D91031F931A2575BC0A9659C8B63 | accessdate = 2008-08-06[/tpl]  He successfully reproduced Milgram's results (the average length of the chain was approximately six links). However, when he examined the pathways taken, he found that "hubs" (highly connected people) were not crucial. Only 5% of the e-mail messages had passed through one of the hubs. This casts doubt on Gladwell's assertion that specific types of people are responsible for bringing about large levels of change.
Watts pointed out that if it were as simple as finding the individuals that can disseminate information prior to a marketing campaign, advertising agencies would presumably have a far higher success rate than they do. He also stated that Gladwell's theory does not square with much of his research into human social dynamics performed in the last ten years.[tpl]cite news | last = Thompson | first = Clive | title = Is the tipping point toast? | work = Fast Company | date = February 2008 | url = http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/122/is-the-tipping-point-toast.html?page=0%2C0 | accessdate = 2008-08-06[/tpl]
Economist Steven Levitt and Malcolm Gladwell have a running dispute about whether the fall in New York City's crime rate can be attributed to the actions of the police department and the "Fixing Broken Windows" effect (as claimed in The Tipping Point).  In his book Freakonomics, Levitt attributes the decrease in crime to two primary factors: 1) a drastic increase in the number of police officers trained and deployed on the streets as well the hiring of Raymond W. Kelly as police commissioner (owing to efforts made by former mayor David Dinkins) and 2) a decrease in the number of unwanted children because of Roe v. Wade, causing crime to drop nationally in all major cities -- "even in Los Angeles, a city notorious for bad policing".[tpl]cite news | last = Gladwell | first = Malcolm | title = Steven Levitt | work = Time Magazine | date = 2006-04-30 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1186920,00.html | accessdate = 2008-12-29[/tpl]
