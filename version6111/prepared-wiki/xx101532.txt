A steel mill or steelworks is an industrial plant for the 
manufacture of steel.
Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon. It is produced in a 
two-stage process. First, iron ore is reduced or 
smelted with coke and limestone in a 
or carried to the next stage as molten iron. In the second 
stage, known as steelmaking, impurities such as sulfur, 
elements such as manganese, nickel, chromium and 
vanadium are added to produce the exact steel required. Steel mills 
then turn molten steel into blooms, ingots, slabs and sheet through 
casting, hot rolling and cold rolling.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the world's largest steel mill
was the Barrow Hematite Steel Company steelworks 
located in Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom. 
Today, the world's largest steel mill is in Gwangyang, South Korea.[ref]http://posco-india.com/website/press-room/news/posco-board-meeting-in-india.htm POSCO Steelâ€™s Fourth Quarter Executive Board Meeting in India New
