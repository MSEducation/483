Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute (also known as Midland Avenue CI, MA, MACI, Midland CI, or Midland; formerly Midland Avenue Secondary School) is a Toronto District School Board-owned alternative learning complex in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada as the Midland Avenue Learning Centre consisting of Scarborough Centre for Alternative Studies (SCAS), South East Year Round Alternative Centre (SEYRAC), and Caring and Safe Schools Midland program. Formerly a regular public high school, it opened in 1962 for the Scarborough Board of Education until its closure in 2000 due to low enrolment.

==History==

Originally named Midland Avenue Secondary School (Midland Avenue SS, MASS or Midland SS), the school facility laid its cornerstone in 1959 with a time capsule was buried at that time.Rushowy, Kristin and Louise Brown. "When a school is lost, we all feel hurt." Toronto Star. July 3, 2000. News p. B01. Retrieved on October 14, 2013. It opened its doors in September 4, 1962 with the sections of the building such as the commercial and technical wing was added along with the swimming pool built in 1963 and 1964. The library section was constructed and opened in 1974.
During the 1980s, Midland experienced a sharp shift due to an overall lower birth rate of the overall population as with most schools in the Toronto area. The school body had also undergone a demographic shift from an influx of new immigration to the nearby area since the early 1990s. This was accompanied and complicated by a drop in attendance from students who lived in the area, who starting in the mid-1980s chose to go other schools such as Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute, David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute, Bendale Business and Technical Institute, R.H. King Academy, Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute, and Cedarbrae Collegiate Institute. [tpl]fact|date=October 2013[/tpl]
In 1988, Midland was risking closure as hundreds of students, parents and teachers jammed the meeting in protest. Trustees were scrambling to find a place to put Scarborough Centre for Alternative Studies to that location (see below)Daly, Rita. "Scarborough centre for adult learning needs new home." Toronto Star. January 10, 1989. Neighbors p. E3. Retrieved on July 29, 2013. SBE has decided to transfer the adult school because it didn't want to part with an ordinary high school due to nearby Tabor Park Vocational School (which is a 2 minute drive) was handed over to the Metropolitan Separate School Board  (now the Toronto Catholic District School Board) by July 1989. The reason given was that enrolment at Midland was declining as projections up to 1996 showed that about 740 students attended the school.Daly, Rita "Board backs off as hundreds protest threatened closing of high school" Toronto Star.

Several incidents happened at Midland such as two female students accused a group of boys of molesting and threatening them in 1990.Gombu, Phinjo. "Three more students charged after complaints of assaults." Toronto Star. October 10, 1990. News p. A6. Retrieved on October 13, 2013. Meanwhile, in April or May 1994, a student tipped the school administration to a hidden cache of knives and high-powered ammunition and stated that there was a fight planned. Police seized more than 59 ammunition rounds and a kitchen knife and an army combat knife. Two teenagers were placed under arrest.Irish, Paul. "Midland principal praises student for tip on ammo." Toronto Star. May 5, 1994. Scarborough/Durham p. SD2. Retrieved on October 13, 2013.
The province defunded the adult day school at Midland Avenue in 1999, causing it to stop operating. The time capsule was opened by Nadine Segal, the principal, in 2000.
===Closure and attempted takeover by the Catholics=== 
When Scarborough became a part of Toronto in 1998, the Scarborough Board of Education became part of the new, but one of the largest boards on the continent, the Toronto District School Board. Changes in the new funding structure caused the creation of a short-list of 138 schools in Toronto proposed to be closed.  The list was a reaction to a creation of a funding formula based on students per square footage of the school, which prompted debate over the issue rather than the actual closure of the schools. Since the physical building was large with a good state of repair, and the population was smaller, it was placed high on the list. This ultimately became justification for closing the school. The closing can be ultimately summed up due to a School Trustee who did not support the teachers and residents' wishes, a lack of civic participation, and a lack of knowledge and participation of new immigrants.[tpl]fact|date=October 2013[/tpl]
According to principal Nadine Seagal, the TDSB argued that since Midland Avenue was under-utilized, with only 650 students in the [tpl]convert|216521|sqft|sqm|adj=on[/tpl] campus that can hold up to 1,358 students, it should be closed. Staff and students advocated for the school to remain open.Talaga, Tanya. "Why us? Midland students ask ; High school can fit 1,358 students but has only 650." 'Toronto Star''. April 27, 1999. News p. 1. Retrieved on October 14, 2013.
As an ultimate consequence, the school was permanently closed at the end of June 2000.Rushowy, Kristin. "Board considers secondary closings." Toronto Star. June 14, 2000. Retrieved on October 13, 2013. "Southwest Scarborough schools: Jean Vanier and Cardinal Newman. The report recommends moving the two schools on to one site, possibly at Midland Collegiate, which the Toronto public board will close this month. Jean Vanier and Cardinal Newman could be turned into single-sex schools." The Toronto Catholic District School Board, meanwhile, attempted to consolidate Jean Vanier Catholic Secondary School (at the former Tabor Park grounds) and Blessed Cardinal Newman Catholic High School (at the St. Augustine's Seminary site) at Midland, but it was never materialized.

===Post-Midland===

Following the closure, in 2001, Midland operated for quite a number of years as the Bond Education Group, a private school leasing the facility from the Toronto District School Board. While public tax dollars goes to education and upkeep of local schools, the public is generally unaware and not usually kept informed of what happens to public properties like school buildings, once a school is closed. While many might have thought the building was outright sold, it seems as if it was just leased to the Bond Education Group, possibly a ten-year lease. By the end of June 2010, Bond was relocated at 1500 Birchmount Rd.
The Toronto District School Board reoccupied parts of building beginning in 2005, establishing South East Year Round Alternative Centre and Safe and Caring Schools Program Area C in the process with the Staff Development in the basement (later moved to Thomson Collegiate). In September 2010, the TDSB relocated Scarborough Centre for Alternative Studies, from its location at Centennial College to the building as Centennial expanded the teaching space by acquiring the latter site and Midland was originally to be the site of the new SCAS just more than 20 years prior.http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/691119/-10-8-million-budget-surplus-and-24-enrolment-growth-fuels-expansion-plans-at-centennial-college As of 2013, Midland currently leases the parts of the building to Not Your Average Day Carehttp://www.nyad.org/ and, since 2001, Olympia Swimming on the northwestern side of the building.http://www.olympianswimming.com/
