==Compounds==

After Neil Bartlett's discovery in 1962 that xenon can form chemical compounds, a large number of xenon compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen.

===Halides===

Three fluorides are known: [tpl]chem|XeF|2[/tpl], [tpl]chem|XeF|4[/tpl], and [tpl]chem|XeF|6[/tpl]. XeF is theorized to be unstable.[tpl]Cite journal | title = Probable nonexistence of xenon monofluoride as a chemically bound species in the gas phase | author = Dean H Liskow, Henry F I I I Schaefer, Paul S Bagus, Bowen Liu | journal = J Amer Chem Soc | year = 1973 | volume = 95 | issue = 12 | pages = 4056–4057 | doi = 10.1021/ja00793a042[/tpl]  The fluorides are the starting point for the synthesis of almost all xenon compounds.
The solid, crystalline difluoride [tpl]chem|XeF|2[/tpl] is formed when a mixture of fluorine and xenon gases is exposed to ultraviolet light. Ordinary daylight is sufficient. Long-term heating of [tpl]chem|XeF|2[/tpl] at high temperatures under an [tpl]chem|NiF|2[/tpl] catalyst yields [tpl]chem|XeF|6[/tpl]. Pyrolysis of [tpl]chem|XeF|6[/tpl] in the presence of NaF yields high-purity [tpl]chem|XeF|4[/tpl].
The xenon fluorides behave as both fluoride acceptors and fluoride donors, forming salts that contain such cations as [tpl]chem|XeF|+[/tpl] and [tpl]chem|Xe[/tpl][tpl]su|b=2[/tpl][tpl]chem|F|3|+[/tpl], and anions such as [tpl]chem|XeF|5|-[/tpl], [tpl]chem|XeF|7|-[/tpl], and [tpl]chem|XeF|8|2-[/tpl]. The green, paramagnetic [tpl]chem|Xe|2|+[/tpl] is formed by the reduction of [tpl]chem|XeF|2[/tpl] by xenon gas.
[tpl]chem|XeF|2[/tpl] is also able to form coordination complexes with transition metal ions. Over 30 such complexes have been synthesized and characterized.
Whereas the xenon fluorides are well-characterized, the other halides are not known, the only exception being the dichloride, XeCl2. Xenon dichloride is reported to be an endothermic, colorless, crystalline compound that decomposes into the elements at 80 °C, formed by the high-frequency irradiation of a mixture of xenon, fluorine, and silicon or carbon tetrachloride. However, doubt has been raised as to whether [tpl]chem|XeCl|2[/tpl] is a real compound and not merely a van der Waals molecule consisting of weakly bound Xe atoms and [tpl]chem|Cl|2[/tpl] molecules. Theoretical calculations indicate that the linear molecule [tpl]chem|XeCl|2[/tpl] is less stable than the van der Waals complex.

===Oxides and oxohalides===

Three oxides of xenon are known: xenon trioxide ([tpl]chem|XeO|3[/tpl]) and xenon tetroxide ([tpl]chem|XeO|4[/tpl]), both of which are dangerously explosive and powerful oxidizing agents, and xenon dioxide (XeO2), which was reported in 2011 with a coordination number of four.[ref]
