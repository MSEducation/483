Edwin Howard Bennett (21 December 1893 â€“ 9 July 1929) was an English cricketer, who played four first-class matches. He was born in Shifnal, Shropshire, and he died at the age of just 35 in East Worthing, Sussex.
Three of Bennett's games were for Worcestershire in 1925, while the other came for the Civil Service (playing their only first-class match) in 1927. In the latter game against the touring New Zealanders, themselves making their first tour of England, he made 73 and 60 (by some distance the highest scores of his career).[ref]
