[[Porcupine]]

CATEGORIES: Porcupines, Rodents, Hystricognath rodents, Body plans

Porcupines are rodents with a coat of sharp spines, or quills, that defend them from predators. They are indigenous to the Americas, Southern Asia, Europe, and Africa. Porcupines are the third largest of the rodents, behind the capybara and the beaver.  Most porcupines are about [tpl]convert|25|-|36|in|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] long, with an [tpl]convert|8|-|10|in|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] long tail. Weighing [tpl]convert|12|-|35|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], they are rounded, large and slow. Porcupines come in various shades of brown, gray, and the unusual white. Porcupines' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated erinaceomorph hedgehogs and monotreme echidnas.
The common porcupine is a herbivore. It eats leaves, herbs, twigs and green plants like clover and in the winter it may eat bark. The North American porcupine often climbs trees to find food. The African porcupine is not a climber and forages on the ground.[tpl]cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/porcupine/ |title=Porcupines, Porcupine Pictures, Porcupine Facts – National Geographic |publisher=Animals.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20[/tpl] It is mostly nocturnal,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nhm.org/site/explore-exhibits/permanent-exhibits/north-american-mammals/porcupine | title=North American porcupine – Erethizon dorsatum (Linnaeus, 1758) | publisher=Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County | accessdate=July 26, 2012[/tpl] but will sometimes forage for food in the day.

The name porcupine comes from Middle French porc espin  (spined pig).Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, s.v. "porcupine" . Retrieved July 20, 2010. A regional American name for the animal is quill pig.Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. "quill" . Retrieved July 20, 2010.

==Species==

A porcupine is any of 29 species of rodent belonging to the families Erethizontidae (genera: Coendou, Sphiggurus, Erethizon, Echinoprocta, and Chaetomys) or Hystricidae (genera: Atherurus, Hystrix, and Trichys). Porcupines vary in size considerably: Rothschild's Porcupine of South America weighs less than a kilogram (2.2 lb); the Crested porcupine found in Italy, Sicily, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa can grow to well over [tpl]convert|27|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. The two families of porcupines are quite different, and although both belong to the Hystricognathi branch of the vast order Rodentia, they are not closely related.
The eleven Old World porcupines  tend to be fairly big, and have spikes that are grouped in clusters.
The two subfamilies of New World porcupines are mostly smaller (although the North American Porcupine reaches about [tpl]convert|85|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl] in length and [tpl]convert|18|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]), have their quills attached singly rather than grouped in clusters, and are excellent climbers, spending much of their time in trees. The New World porcupines evolved their spines independently (through convergent evolution) and are more closely related to several other families of rodent than they are to the Old World porcupines.
Porcupines have a relatively high longevity and had held the record for being the longest-living rodent,Parker, SB (1990) Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals, vol. 4, McGraw-Hill, New York.[tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] until it was recently broken by the naked mole rat.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1126/sageke.2002.21.pe7 |pmid=14602989 |date=May 2002 |last1=Buffenstein |first1=Rochelle |last2=Jarvis |first2=Jennifer U.

==Quills==

left|thumb|Quills come in varying lengths and colors, depending on the animal's age and species.Porcupines' quills, or spines, take on various forms, depending on the species, but all are modified hairs coated with thick plates of keratin, and they are embedded in the skin musculature. Old World porcupines (Hystricidae) have quills embedded in clusters, whereas in New World porcupines (Erethizontidae), single quills are interspersed with bristles, underfur and hair.
Quills are released by contact with them, or they may drop out when the porcupine shakes its body. New quills grow to replace lost ones. From ancient times, it was believed that porcupines could throw their quills at an enemy, but this has long been refuted.[tpl]cite book|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica: Or, A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous Literature, Enlarged and Improved|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Is0nAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA50|year=1823|publisher=Archibald Constable|pages=501–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Shepard, Thomas Goodwin|title=The natural history of secession|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MTA5AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA78|year=1865|publisher=Derby & Miller|pages=78–[/tpl]

==Uses==

Porcupines are only occasionally eaten in western culture, but are very popular in Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, where the prominent use of them as a food source has contributed to significant declines in their populations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100825103830.htm |title=Wild Southeast Asian porcupines under threat due to illegal hunting, researchers find |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2010-08-25 |accessdate=2012-02-20[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2010.07.030|title=The conservation impact of commercial wildlife farming of porcupines in Vietnam|year=2010|last1=Brooks|first1=Emma G.E.|last2=Roberton|first2=Scott I.|last3=Bell|first3=Diana J.|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=143|issue=11|pages=2808 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Ettinger, Powell |url=http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/news/porcupine-vietnam.html#cr |title=Wildlife Extra News – Illegal hunting threatens Vietnamâ€™s wild porcupines |publisher=Wildlifeextra.com |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2012-02-20[/tpl]
More commonly, their quills and guardhairs are used for traditional decorative clothing.  For example, their guardhairs are used in the creation of the Native American "porky roach" headdress.  The main quills may be dyed, and then applied in combination with thread to embellish leather accessories such as knife sheaths and leather bags. Lakota women would harvest the quills for quillwork by throwing a blanket over a porcupine and retrieving the quills it left stuck in the blanket.[tpl]cite web |url=http://aktalakota.stjo.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=8681 |accessdate= 29 June 2013 |title= Lakota Quillwork Art and Legend[/tpl]
Porcupine quills have recently inspired a new type of hypodermic needle. Thanks to backward-facing barbs on the quills, when used as needles, they are particularly good at two things – penetrating the skin and remaining in place.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1216441109|title=Microstructured barbs on the North American porcupine quill enable easy tissue penetration and difficult removal|year=2012|last1=Cho|first1=W.

==Habitat==

Porcupines occupy a short range of habitats in tropical and temperate parts of Asia, Southern Europe, Africa, and North and South America. Porcupines live in forests, deserts, rocky outcrops and hillsides. Some New World porcupines live in trees, but Old World porcupines stay on the rocks. Porcupines can be found on rocky areas up to [tpl]convert|3700|m|abbr=on[/tpl] high. Porcupines are generally nocturnal but are occasionally active during daylight.

==Classification==

Porcupines are distributed into two evolutionary independent groups of the order Rodentia, suborder Hystricomorpha.[tpl]cite journal| author = Huchon D., Catzeflis F. & Douzery E. J.
