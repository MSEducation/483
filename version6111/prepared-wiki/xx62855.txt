The Agora ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἀγορά[/tpl], Agorá) was a central spot in ancient Greek city-states. The literal meaning of the word is "gathering place" or "assembly". The agora was the center of athletic, artistic, spiritual and political life of the city.[tpl]cite book |title = International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe | last=Ring, Salkin, Boda | first=Trudy, Robert, Sharon | publisher = Routledge|date = January 1, 1996 | pages = 66 | isbn=978-1-884964-02-2[/tpl] The Ancient Agora of Athens was the best-known example.

==Origins==

Early in Greek history (18th century–8th century BC), free-born male land-owners who were citizens would gather in the agora for military duty or to hear statements of the ruling king or council. Later, the agora also served as a marketplace where merchants kept stalls or shops to sell their goods amid colonnades.
From this twin function of the agora as a political and commercial space came the two Greek verbs [tpl]lang|grc|ἀγοράζω[/tpl], agorázō, "I shop", and [tpl]lang|grc|ἀγορεύω[/tpl], agoreúō, "I speak in public". The word agoraphobia, the fear of leaving a certain area or public situations, derives from the meaning of agora as a gathering place.
