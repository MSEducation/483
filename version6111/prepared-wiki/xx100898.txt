Chafing under the restraints of the schools, he traveled to Brittany, where at Pont-Aven and Concarneau he turned his attention to marine painting and landscape. 
A figure-piece he sent to the 1882 Salon attracted attention, a boy daydreaming on the beach, which he called Châteaux en Espagne (Castles in Spain) (1882, Metropolitan Museum of Art).Castles in Spain from Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the 1885 Salon, he had a large canvas of several nude women called En Arcadie (1885, Musée d'Orsay),En Arcadie from Musée d-Orsay. a remarkable study of flesh tones in light and shade which had a strong influence on the younger men of the day. This received an honourable mention, the first of many awards conferred upon him. Les Amateurs (1882-83, Brauer Museum of Art), was awarded a first medal at the 1889 Paris Exhibition. Other honors included the 1887 Temple Gold Medal of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and medals in Munich, Brussels, Ghent, Vienna and elsewhere.

==Marcel Proust==

Harrison rented a ramshackle cottage near the Brittany town of Beg-Meil, and each evening raced to the dunes to watch the sun set over the ocean. In late-summer 1896, he was joined there by struggling writer Marcel Proust and composer Reynaldo Hahn. He opened their eyes to how light plays on water:  "We have seen the sea successively turn blood red, purple, nacreous with silver, gold, white, emerald green, and yesterday we were dazzled by an entirely pink sea specked with blue sails."Hahn to Marie Nordlinger, quoted in William C. Carter, Marcel Proust, A Life (New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2000), p. 197.  Harrison seems to have been the inspiration for the character "C," in Proust's attempted first novel Jean Santeuil; along with aspects of the character "Elstir," the painter in Remembrance of Things Past.R.
