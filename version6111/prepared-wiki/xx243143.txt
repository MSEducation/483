==Sound==

"Musically, it’s by the same producers so it’s gonna have the same type of feel. But it’s different because on the joints I think our message also sets the tone. Like, we are that last instrument. And we tried to do that intentionally on the project. It’s a lot of melodies on the project. It’s a lot of things like… We brought the best out of each other I think. Like, O brought the best out of me. I’ve learned at this stage of my game, “Oh, this is how you attack something like that when you wanna attack it with some melody…” ‘Cause I definitely know O specializes in that. So, I think we gained a lot from each other and learned when we go on and do our next project, “Oh, I could add this to my shit. This is somethin’ I learned from my cohort, my partna.” So that’s dope. And a lot of that is reflected in the music, how we feed off of each other.", said AG."The Last Ones Left http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1386/title.o-c-a-g-the-last-ones-left", HipHopDX

==Production & Guests==

Blaze previously worked with O.C. and A.G. on The Movement and Show & AG's Live Hard, both released in 2008. Guests are kept to a minimum, a female singer named Mirror Image sings the choruses on "Get Away" and "Pain" while DJ Premier lay down cuts and scratches for the 1st single, Two For The Money".
"...And I think that’s what you might hear separating it from The Movement, because this is a concentrated effort of O.C. and A.G.…more so than any other project because you hear us here and there. This is constantly us. There is no features on there. It’s just us." explains A.G. in an interview.
