[tpl]nihongo|Hello Pro Kenshūsei|ハロプロ研修生[/tpl], formerly [tpl]Nihongo|Hello! Pro Egg|ハロプロエッグ|Haro Puro Eggu|also abbreviated as [tpl]Nihongo|Egg|エッグ|Eggu[/tpl][/tpl] are a group of female singers under the Hello! Project (commonly shortened to "Hello Pro") banner. They are girls chosen when Tsunku and other audition administrators see talent in them that can be developed further, in the hope of one day turning them into successful musicians, and possibly integrating them into other Hello! Project groups. As an example, in 2011, Hello Pro Egg member Mizuki Fukumura joined Morning Musume.
The first official Hello! Pro Egg audition was held in 2004, with subsequent auditions held in 2006 and 2007. The first "generation" of Eggs were chosen from the 2004 auditions, with a total of 30 girls passing the audition. These auditions were initially only for girls from elementary school age to 18 years old, but in recent years have allowed girls as old as 25.[tpl]Wayback|url=http://morningmusume.dream.com/news/04_audition/index.html|title=Hello!

Although Hello! Pro Eggs were at first rarely seen, since the mass graduation of Hello! Project's Elder Club in March 2009, they have gradually become more active, sometimes performing on stage during concerts (usually as dancers, but occasionally singers), and being assigned to Hello! Project units.
