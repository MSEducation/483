==History==

The party was founded in 2006 by dissident members of the Liberal and Centre Union that were unhappy with Artūras Zuokas's leadership.
In the legislative elections of 2008, the first elections LRLS has ever taken part in, it gained 11 seats in the Seimas and 5.72 percent of the national vote.  The LRLS formed a coalition with the Homeland Union, the Liberal and Centre Union, and the National Resurrection Party.  This coalition gained a combined governmental majority of 80 out of 141 seats in the Seimas, led by Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius of the Homeland Union. At the subsequent elections of 2012, the party lost one seat to finish with 10 seats in the Seimas and 8.57 percent of the national vote.
