[[Debunkify]]

CATEGORIES: Tobacco in the United States

Debunkify is a campaign established in July 2006 aimed at dispelling tobacco and secondhand smoke misperceptions. A mobile marketing tour, complete with a Debunkify-branded vehicle and a team of brand ambassadors, canvassed the state of Ohio on a 10-month run, with the aim of debunking tobacco myths and correcting tobacco misperceptions at each of its stops.http://www.wtap.com/news/headlines/5278201.html
Throughout June 2007, 17 participating standTunz artists battled it out online for a chance to play at the Myth Farewell Tour Main Event.http://www.cd101.com/sections/events/picturepages/picture_page.asp?pp_id=1198 For five weeks, Ohioans cast nearly 15,300 votes at debunkify.com for their favorite tobacco-free Ohio band. As a result, Kate Voegele and Jackson Rohm from Cleveland headlined the Main Event on July 14 at the Newport Music Hall in Columbus. The MFT Main Event served as the final event to the 10-month mobile tour and the seven-month Myth Farewell Tour.
