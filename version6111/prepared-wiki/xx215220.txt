Caenis is a genus of mayflies. They are very small in size, sometimes with a body of only an 1/8 of an inch ([tpl]Convert|.125|in|mm|disp=output only[/tpl]).

==Distribution and Ecology==

Caenis is one of the most abundant mayfly genera of the Holarctic.Clifford, 1980  Larvae can occur in high densities on the bottoms of shallow ponds and lakes up to an altitude of 1800 meters in the Alps. 
Densities of 700-1700 larvae per square meter have been reported for C. luctuosa and C. horaria on bottoms covered with organic detritus or decaying leaves. Densities on mineral sediments are an order of magnitude lower (4-330 animals per square meter).

==Varia==

Imitations of this mayfly in hook sizes as small as # 28 are used for fly-fishing.http://www.troutnut.com/hatch/392/Mayfly-Caenis-Anglers-Curses Tying fly imitations this small is very difficult, hence the nickname "Anglers Curse."
