He also implies that Marlowe had Catholic sympathies. Other passages are merely sceptical in tone: "he persuades men to atheism, willing them not to be afraid of bugbears and hobgoblins". The final paragraph of Baines' document reads:
 These thinges, with many other shall by good & honest witnes be aproved to be his opinions and Comon Speeches, and that this Marlowe doth not only hould them himself, but almost into every Company he Cometh he perswades men to Atheism willing them not to be afeard of bugbeares and hobgoblins, and vtterly scorning both god and his ministers as I Richard Baines will Justify & approue both by mine oth and the testimony of many honest men, and almost al men with whome he hath Conversed any time will testify the same, and as I think all men in Cristianity ought to indevor that the mouth of so dangerous a member may be stopped, he saith likewise that he hath quoted a number of Contrarieties oute of the Scripture which he hath giuen to some great men who in Convenient time shalbe named. When these thinges shalbe Called in question the witnes shalbe produced.[ref]

Similar examples of Marlowe's statements were given by Thomas Kyd after his imprisonment and possible torture (see above);For a full transcript, see Peter Farey's Marlowe page (Retrieved 31 March 2012). both Kyd and Baines connect Marlowe with the mathematician Thomas Harriot and Walter Raleigh's circle. Another documentThe so-called 'Remembrances' against Richard Cholmeley. For a full transcript, see Peter Farey's Marlowe page (Retrieved 31 March 2012). claimed at around the same time that "one Marlowe is able to show more sound reasons for Atheism than any divine in England is able to give to prove divinity, and that ... he hath read the Atheist lecture to Sir Walter Raleigh and others."
Some critics believe that Marlowe sought to disseminate these views in his work and that he identified with his rebellious and iconoclastic protagonists.Waith, Eugene. The Herculean Hero in Marlowe, Chapman, Shakespeare, and Dryden. London: Chatto and Windus, 1962. The idea is commonplace, though by no means universally accepted. However, plays had to be approved by the Master of the Revels before they could be performed, and the censorship of publications was under the control of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Presumably these authorities did not consider any of Marlowe's works to be unacceptable (apart from the Amores).

===Sexuality===

Like his contemporary William Shakespeare, Marlowe is sometimes described today as homosexual. Others argue that the question of whether an Elizabethan was gay or homosexual in a modern sense is anachronistic. For the Elizabethans, what is often today termed homosexual or bisexual was more likely to be recognised as a sexual act, rather than an exclusive sexual orientation and identity.[tpl]cite book|last=Smith|first=Bruce R.|title=Homosexual desire in Shakespeare's England|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=March 1995|page=74|isbn=0-226-76366-8[/tpl] Some scholars argue that the evidence is inconclusive and that the reports of Marlowe's homosexuality may simply be exaggerated rumours produced after his death. Richard Baines reported Marlowe as saying: "All they that love not Tobacco and Boys are fools". David Bevington and Eric Rasmussen describe Baines's evidence as "unreliable testimony" and make the comment: "These and other testimonials need to be discounted for their exaggeration and for their having been produced under legal circumstances we would regard as a witch-hunt".Doctor Faustus and Other Plays, pp. viii–ix One critic, J.B. Steane, remarked that he considers there to be "no evidence for Marlowe's homosexuality at all." Other scholars,[tpl]cite book |last=White|first=Paul Whitfield, ed.|title=Marlowe, History and Sexuality: New Critical Essays on Christopher Marlowe|publisher=AMS Press|location=New York|year=1998[/tpl] however, point to homosexual themes in Marlowe's writing: in Hero and Leander, Marlowe writes of the male youth Leander, "in his looks were all that men desire"Hero and Leander, 88 (see Project Gutenberg). and that when the youth swims to visit Hero at Sestos, the sea god Neptune becomes sexually excited, "imagining that Ganymede, displeas'd, had left the Heavens ... the lusty god embrac'd him, call'd him love ... He watched his arms and, as they opened wide at every stroke, betwixt them would he slide and steal a kiss, ... And dive into the water, and there pry upon his breast, his thighs, and every limb, ... and talk of love",Hero and Leander, 157–192. while the boy, naive and unaware of Greek love practices, protests, [tpl]"'[/tpl]You are deceiv'd, I am no woman, I.' Thereat smil'd Neptune."Hero and Leander, 192–193. Edward the Second contains the following passage supporting homosexual relationships:
 
 The mightiest kings have had their minions;
Great Alexander loved Hephaestion,
The conquering Hercules for Hylas wept;
And for Patroclus, stern Achilles drooped.
And not kings only, but the wisest men:
The Roman Tully loved Octavius,
Grave Socrates, wild Alcibiades.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eGvavCqLW2AC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=%22The+mightiest+kings+have+had+their+minions%3B+Great+Alexander+loved+Hephaestion,+The+conquering+Hercules+for+Hylas+wept%3B+And+for+Patroclus,+stern+Achilles+drooped.%22&source=bl&ots=lkkmTORxKg&sig=deq6DppnJ_C-l-TSTOkIbKM8ZcI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_hQHUbDgPJOY1AWv9YGgCg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22The%20mightiest%20kings%20have%20had%20their%20minions%3B%20Great%20Alexander%20loved%20Hephaestion%2C%20The%20conquering%20Hercules%20for%20Hylas%20wept%3B%20And%20for%20Patroclus%2C%20stern%20Achilles%20drooped.%22&f=false |title=The Routledge Anthology of Renaissance Drama[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Simon Barker, Hilary Hinds[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-09[/tpl]

==Reputation among contemporary writers==

Whatever the particular focus of modern critics, biographers and novelists, for his contemporaries in the literary world, Marlowe was above all an admired and influential artist. Within weeks of his death, George Peele remembered him as "Marley, the Muses' darling"; Michael Drayton noted that he "Had in him those brave translunary things / That the first poets had", and Ben Jonson wrote of "Marlowe's mighty line". Thomas Nashe wrote warmly of his friend, "poor deceased Kit Marlowe". So too did the publisher Edward Blount, in the dedication of Hero and Leander to Sir Thomas Walsingham.
Among the few contemporary dramatists to say anything negative about Marlowe was the anonymous author of the Cambridge University play The Return From Parnassus (1598) who wrote, "Pity it is that wit so ill should dwell, / Wit lent from heaven, but vices sent from hell."
The most famous tribute to Marlowe was paid by Shakespeare in As You Like It, where he not only quotes a line from Hero and Leander ("Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might, 'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?[tpl]'"[/tpl]) but also gives to the clown Touchstone the words "When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room." This appears to be a reference to Marlowe's murder which involved a fight over the "reckoning", the bill, as well as to a line in Marlowe's Jew of Malta[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]"Infinite riches in a little room".
Shakespeare was heavily influenced by Marlowe in his work, as can be seen in the re-using of Marlovian themes in Antony and Cleopatra, The Merchant of Venice, Richard II, and Macbeth (Dido, Jew of Malta, Edward II and Dr Faustus respectively). In Hamlet, after meeting with the travelling actors, Hamlet requests the Player perform a speech about the Trojan War, which at 2.2.429–32 has an echo of Marlowe's Dido, Queen of Carthage. In Love's Labour's Lost Shakespeare brings on a character "Marcade" (three syllables) in conscious acknowledgement of Marlowe's character "Mercury", also attending the King of Navarre, in Massacre at Paris. The significance, to those of Shakespeare's audience who had read Hero and Leander, was Marlowe's identification of himself with the god Mercury.[tpl]cite book|last=Wilson|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Wilson (scholar)|editor=Mayer, Jean-Christophe |title=Representing France and the French in early modern English drama|year=2008|publisher=University of Delaware Press|location=Newark, DE|isbn=0-87413-000-X|pages=95–97|chapter=Worthies away: the scene begins to cloud in Shakespeare's Navarre[/tpl]

==As Shakespeare==

Given the inconsistencies concerning the account of Marlowe's death, a theory has arisen centred on the notion that Marlowe may have faked his death and then continued to write under the assumed name of William Shakespeare. However, orthodox academic consensus rejects alternative candidates for authorship, including Marlowe.Kathman, David (2003), "The Question of Authorship", in Wells, Stanley; Orlin, Lena C., Shakespeare: an Oxford Guide, Oxford University Press, pp. 620–32, ISBN 978-0-19-924522-2 On the other hand, in August 1819 an anonymous writer in The Monthly Review asked, "Can Christopher Marlowe be a nom de guerre assumed for a time by Shakespeare?"Boas, Christopher Marlowe, p. 300.

==Memorial window in Poets' Corner==

In July 2002, a memorial window to Marlowe – a gift of the Marlowe SocietyChristopher Marlowe – Westminster Abbey – was unveiled in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. Controversially, a question mark was added to the generally accepted date of death.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Nigel Reynolds | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1401010/Marlowe-tribute-puts-question-mark-over-Shakespeare.html | title = Marlowe tribute puts question mark over Shakespeare | journal = The Telegraph | date = 11 Jul 2002[/tpl] On 25 October 2011 a letter from Paul Edmondson and Stanley Wells was published by The Times newspaper, in which they called on the Dean and Chapter to remove the question mark on the grounds that it "flew in the face of a mass of unimpugnable evidence".[tpl]Harvnb|Edmondson|2013|p=278.[/tpl] In 2012, they renewed this call in their e-book Shakespeare Bites Back, adding that it "denies history",Shakespeare Bites Back – free book pp. 21, 22 & 38. and again the following year in their book Shakespeare Beyond Doubt.[tpl]Harvnb|Edmondson|2013|p=234.[/tpl]
