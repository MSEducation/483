==Early life==

Duncan Smith was born in Madras, India on 28 May 1914, the son of an officer in the Indian civil service. He was educated in Scotland, where he joined his school's OTC. Returning to India in 1933, he became a coffee and tea planter, but in 1936 returned to the UK to join the RAF.

==World War II==

Serving at 7 Operational Training Unit at the outbreak of war, he was posted to No. 611 Squadron RAF later that year. He was awarded a DFC in June 1941, and went to No. 603 Squadron RAF in August 1941 as a Flight Commander. Smith was due for a rest but had to remain operational, leading his squadron while bringing their new Squadron Leader up to speed. On 20 November he was taken ill, passing out after returning from a convoy patrol. Smith spent some time in hospital with double pneumonia, the symptoms of which he had assumed was only the result of exhaustion from a long operational tour. Upon recovery in March 1942 he was promoted to Squadron Leader and given command of No. 64 Squadron RAF. In August he became Wing Commander, flying at RAF North Weald. In November he was rested from operations with a posting to take charge of the Tactics Branch at Fighter Command, his input leading to the formation of the Fighter Command School of Tactics at RAF Charmy Down.
While Smith's non-operational tour was recognised as very productive, he began to seek a return to operations, and he was then sent to the Mediterranean as Wing leader, 244 Wing, on Malta. In September 1943 after engine failure he bailed out into the sea, being rescued after 5 hours adrift. As a Group Captain, he then took charge of 324 Wing, finally leaving in March 1945.
Duncan Smith was credited with 17 confirmed kills, two shared kills, six probables, two shared probables and eight damaged in aerial combat.
