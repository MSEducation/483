At its mouth, the Orinoco forms a wide delta that branches off into hundreds of rivers and waterways that flow through [tpl]convert|41,000|km2|-3|abbr=on[/tpl] of swampy forests. In the rainy season, the Orinoco can swell to a breadth of [tpl]convert|22|km|0[/tpl] and a depth of [tpl]convert|100|m|-1[/tpl].
Most of the important Venezuelan rivers are tributaries of the Orinoco, the largest being the Caroní, which joins it at Puerto Ordaz, close to the Llovizna Falls. A peculiarity of the Orinoco river system is the Casiquiare canal, which starts as an arm of the Orinoco, and finds its way to the Rio Negro, a tributary of the Amazon, thus forming a 'natural canal' between Orinoco and Amazon.

===Major rivers in the Orinoco Basin===

==Ecology==

The Boto, or Amazon River Dolphin, is also known to inhabit the Orinoco River system. The Orinoco Crocodile is one of the rarest reptiles in the world, with fewer than 250 specimens remaining in the wild.  Its present-day range in the wild is restricted to the Orinoco River Basin. The Orinoco is home to the Caribe Piranha or Pygocentrus cariba.

==Economic activity==

The river is navigable for most of its length, and dredging enables ocean ships to go as far as Ciudad Bolívar, at the confluence of the Caroní River, [tpl]convert|435|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] upstream. River steamers carry cargo as far as Puerto Ayacucho and the Atures Rapids.

===El Florero Iron Mine===

In 1926 a Venezuelan mining inspector found one of the richest iron ore deposits near the Orinoco delta, south of the town of San Felix on a mountain name El Florero.  Full-scale mining of the ore deposits began after World War II, by a conglomerate of Venezuelan firms and US steel companies.  At the start in the early 1950s, about 10,000 tons of ore-bearing soil was mined per day."Venezuela's Magnetic Mountain" Popular Mechanics, July 1949

===Orinoco Tar Sands===

The Orinoco river deposits also contain extensive tar sands in the Orinoco oil belt, which may be a source of future oil production.Forero, Juan (1 June 2006) "For Venezuela, A Treasure In Oil Sludge" New York Times Vol. 155 Issue 53597, pC1-C6

==Eastern Venezuelan Basin==

Encompassing the states of Anzoategui-Guarico and Monagas states, the Interior Range forms the northern boundary and the Guayana Shield the southern.Prieto, R., Valdes, G., 1992, El Furrial Oil Field, In Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade, 1978-1988, AAPG Memoir 54, Halbouty, M.T., editor, Tulsa: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, ISBN0891813330[tpl]rp|155[/tpl]  Maturin forms the eastern subbasin and Guarico the western.[tpl]rp|156[/tpl]  The El Furrial oil field was discovered in 1978, producing from late Oligocene shallow marine sandstones in an overthrusted foreland basin.[tpl]rp|155[/tpl]

==Recreation and sports==

Since 1988, the local government of Ciudad Guayana has conducted a swim race in the rivers Orinoco and Caroní, with up to 1000 competitors. Since 1991, the "Paso a Nado Internacional de los Rios Orinoco-Caroní" has been celebrated every year, on a Sunday close to 19 April. Worldwide, this swim-meet has gained in importance, and it has a large number of competitors."Antecedentes y Sumario Paso a Nado Internacional de Los Rios Orinoco/Caroni" Paso Nado Internacional de Los Rios Orinoco y Caroní Official website in Spanish, translation of title: "Antecedents and Summary of the International Swim Meet of the Orinoco and Caroni Rivers"
