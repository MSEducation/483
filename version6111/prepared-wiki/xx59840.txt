The ocelot ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|s|əl|ɒ|t[/tpl]; Leopardus pardalis), also known as the dwarf leopard, is a wild cat distributed extensively over South America including the islands of Trinidad and Margarita, Central America, and Mexico. It has been reported as far north as Texas.Ocelot. The Animal Files. Retrieved on 2012-04-10.  North of Mexico, it is found regularly only in the extreme southern part of Texas,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/texas/animals/art25117.html |title=The Nature Conservancy in Texas – Mammals – Ocelot |publisher=nature.org[/tpl] although there are rare sightings in southern Arizona.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/mna/image_info.cfm?species_id=130 |title=North American Mammals – Carnivora – Felidae – Leopardus pardalis |publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History |accessdate=2010-02-23[/tpl]
The ocelot is similar in appearance to a domestic cat. Its fur resembles that of a clouded leopard or jaguar and was once regarded as particularly valuable. As a result, hundreds of thousands of ocelots were once killed for their fur. The feline was classified a "vulnerable" endangered species from 1972 until 1996, and is now rated "least concern" by the 2008 IUCN Red List.

==Etymology==

The name ocelot comes from the Nahuatl word ōcēlōtl ([tpl]IPA-nah|oːˈseːloːt͡ɬ|pron[/tpl]), which usually refers to the jaguar (Panthera onca) rather than the ocelot.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title =ocelot, n. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher= |location= |id= [/tpl][tpl]cite book |first=Frances |last=Karttunen |year=1983 |authorlink=Frances Karttunen|title=An Analytical Dictionary of Nahuatl |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |page=176[/tpl][tpl]cite book |first=James |last=Lockhart |authorlink=James Lockhart (historian)|year=2001 |title=Nahuatl as Written: Lessons in Older Written Nahuatl, with Copious Examples and Texts |location=Stanford, California |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=228[/tpl]

==Taxonomy==

The ocelot's genus Leopardus consists of nine species similar to the ocelot, such as Geoffroy's cat and the margay, which are also endemic to South and Central America. All of the cats in Leopardus are spotted, lithe, and small, with the ocelot being the biggest.

===Subspecies===

The following are the currently recognized subspecies of ocelot:
Certain ocelot subspecies are officially endangered, although the species as a whole is not.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]

==Physical characteristics==

The ocelot ranges from [tpl]convert|68|to|100|cm[/tpl] in length, plus [tpl]convert|26|to|45|cm|in|sp=us[/tpl] in tail length, and typically weighs [tpl]convert|8|to|18|kg|lb[/tpl], although much larger individuals have occasionally been recorded,[tpl]cite book |title=Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife |first=David |last=Burnie |coauthor=Don E. Wilson |location=New York City |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=0-7894-7764-5 |year=2001[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/staffpubs/docs/15933.pdf |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=808–816 |year=2006 |title=Competitive release in diets of ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and puma (Puma concolor) after jaguar (Panthera onca) decline |author=Moreno, R. S.  |doi=10.1644/05-MAMM-A-360R2.1|last2=Kays|first2=Roland W.|last3=Samudio|first3=Rafael[/tpl] making it the largest of the generally dainty Leopardus wild cat genus. It has sleek, smooth fur, rounded ears and relatively large front paws. While similar in appearance to the oncilla and margay, which inhabit the same region, the ocelot is larger.
The coat pattern of ocelots can vary, being anything from cream to reddish-brown in color, or sometimes grayish, and marked with black rosettes. In many individuals, some of the spots, especially on the back, blend together to form irregular curved stripes or bands. The fur is short, and paler than the rest of the coat beneath. There are also single white spots, called ocelli, on the backs of the ears. Two black stripes line both sides of the face, and the long tail is banded by black.

==Behavior==

The ocelot is mostly nocturnal and very territorial. It will fight fiercely, sometimes to the death, in territorial disputes. In addition, the cat marks its territory with urine. Like most felines, it is solitary, usually meeting only to mate. However, during the day it rests in trees or other dense foliage, and will occasionally share its spot with another ocelot of the same sex. Males occupy territories of [tpl]convert|3.5|to|46|km2|sqmi|sp=us[/tpl], while females occupy smaller, non-overlapping territories of [tpl]convert|0.8|to|15|km2|sqmi|sp=us[/tpl]. Territories are marked by urine spraying and by leaving feces in prominent locations, sometimes favoring particular latrine sites.
Ocelots hunt over a range of [tpl]convert|18|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl], taking mostly small animals, including mammals, lizards, turtles, and frogs, crabs, birds, and fish.[tpl]cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of World Wildlife |first=Mike |last=Briggs |coauthor=Peggy Briggs |publisher=Parragon Books |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4054-3679-3[/tpl] Almost all of the prey that the ocelot hunts is far smaller than itself, with rodents, rabbits, and opossums forming the largest part of the diet. Studies suggest that it follows and finds prey via odor trails, but the ocelot also has very good vision, including night vision.

==Reproduction and life cycle==

Ocelots typically breed only once every other year, although the female may mate again shortly after losing a litter. Mating can occur at any time of year, and estrus lasts from seven to ten days.
After mating, the female will find a den in a cave in a rocky bluff, a hollow tree, or a dense (preferably thorny) thicket. Gestation lasts 79 to 82 days, and usually results in the birth of only a single kitten, with its eyes closed and a thin covering of hair. Litters of two or three kittens also occur, but are less common. The small litter size and relative infrequency of breeding make the ocelot particularly vulnerable to population loss.
Compared with other small cats, ocelot kittens grow quite slowly. They weigh around [tpl]convert|250|g|oz[/tpl] at birth, and do not open their eyes for 15 to 18 days. They begin to leave the den at three months, but remain with their mother for up to two years, before dispersing to establish their own territory. Ocelots live for up to 20 years in captivity.

==Distribution and habitat==

The ocelot is distributed extensively over South America (including the islands of Margarita and Trinidad), Central America, and Mexico with a small population in southern Texas.Trinidad.

In Trinidad, habitat fragmentation, as well as direct exploitation via illegal poaching are major threats to the survival of the remnant populations of ocelots on the island. No empirical studies have been conducted to reliably estimate population status on the island. Historical records indicate that the species once existed on the island of Tobago, but it has long been extirpated there.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Ocelots only inhabit areas with relatively dense vegetation cover, although they may occasionally hunt in more open areas at night. They are found in tropical forest, thorn forest, mangrove swamps and savanna, at elevations ranging up to [tpl]convert|1200|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl].[tpl]cite book|author=Sunquist, Mel|author2=Sunquist, Fiona|year=2002|title= Wild cats of the World |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= Chicago |pages= 120–129|isbn= 0-226-77999-8[/tpl]
