Love Among the Cannibals is an album released in 1989 by rock band Starship. It was the first album after Grace Slick's departure from the band, and their last studio release.  The song "Wild Again" had previously been produced for the soundtrack to Cocktail (1988), and was included as an bonus track for the album's CD release.  The album had one top-20 single on the Billboard charts, "It's Not Enough", which peaked at #12 in October 1989 and was their final Top-40 hit, but the album itself only climbed to #64. The track "I'll Be There" went on to being featured in the end credits of Gross Anatomy (1989).
