The Jewish Socialist Verband (JSV) was a secular Jewish Yiddish-oriented organization founded in the United States of America in 1921 as a result of a political split in the Jewish Socialist Federation (JSF) regarding the Federation's position in support of the Bolshevik Revolution. With the disaffiliation of the JSF from the Socialist Party of America in 1921, the minority opposed to this formed the JSV, which became the SPA's Jewish language federation.[ref]
