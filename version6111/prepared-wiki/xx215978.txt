==Ankaragücü and Ankaraspor Case==

Cengiz Topel Yıldırım was replaced by Ahmet Gökçek as club chairman of Ankaragücü. Since Ahmet Gökçek was previously on Ankaraspor board as a volunteer, TFF rejected this replacement. Melih Gökçek, who is honorary chairman of Ankaraspor and Ahmet Gökçek's father, accused him of being subjective.
