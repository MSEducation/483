Tell Arbid is an ancient Near East archaeological site in the Khabur River Basin region of Al-Hasakah Governorate, Syria near Tell Mozan, the site of ancient Urkesh.

==History==

Little is currently known about the history or identity of Tell Arbid. The site was heavily occupied during Early Dynastic times of the 3rd Millennium, primarily Ninevite 5 and Early Dynastic III periods, then sporadically in the Akkadian, Mitanni, Neo-Babylonian and the Hellenistic period.

==Archaeology==

The site comprises a large main tell and 4 smaller mounds, together covering about 38 hectares with a height of around 30 meters. The main tell consists primarily of Mittani, Akkadian, Early Dynastic, and Ninevite 5 layers with the later two including monumental buildings. The initial excavation of Tell Arbid was performed by a British Museum team led by M.E.L. Mallowan. The operation ran from 1934 to 1936. Items collected during the excavations ended up in the British Museum, the Institute of Archaeology Collections at University College London, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, and in Syria.The excavations at Tell Chagar Bazar and an archaeological survey of the Habur region. 2nd Campaign, M.E.L.
