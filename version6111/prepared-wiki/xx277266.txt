The Judge Henry Wood, Jr. House is a historic home located at Clarksville, Mecklenburg County, Virginia. It is a two-story, Queen Anne style brick dwelling built in three sections.  The original section was built between about 1820 and 1840, and forms the center section.  The north wing was added after 1872, and the south wing, with an octagonal end, in the 1880s.  Confederate General William Mahone (1826-1895), owned the property from 1862 to 1868.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Mecklenburg/192-0060_Judge_Henry_Wood_House_1999_Final_Nomination.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Judge Henry Wood, Jr. House|author= John G.
