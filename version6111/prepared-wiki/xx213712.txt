Burnet was not known for his preaching, but more as an orator and speaker on platforms like Exeter Hall. He spoke against the Corn Laws and for Anti-Slavery. In 19 March 1838, Burnet was with Peter Clare, Rev. W.N. Bunting; William Dilworth Crewdson when they presented a petition to Queen Victoria signed by 28,386 females of Manchester and Salford who requested freedom for the negro apprenticesbasically a legal nicety. "Apprentices" were nearly but not quite slaves. in the British Colonies.The Calcutta Christian Observer, 1838, accessed 4 August 2008 (A similar petition was presented by Lord Brougham, Joseph Sturge, Captain Hansard RN and the Reverend Thomas Scales based on resolutions passed ar meetings at Exeter Hall of "friends of the negro".).
