He was a member of the Victorian Sculptors' Society. Around 1960, he joined with Clifford Last, Inge King, Vincas Jomantas and Lenton Parr to form a splinter group which exhibited together as the 'Centre Five'. In 1967 they split from the Society, which never recovered from the departure of so many of its prominent members.http://www.sculptorsvictoria.asn.au/association_history.php
According to Australian art critic Alan McCulloch "He was raised in the tradition of peasant wood-carvings, many of which were hung on trees. This influence accounts for the flatness, the two-dimensional quality in the work not only of Zikaras but also in that of many other Lithuanian sculptors."Encyclopedia of Australian Art Alan McCulloch, Hutchinson of London 1968
