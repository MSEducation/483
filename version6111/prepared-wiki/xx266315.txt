===Time trial===

The initial plan was to have a time trial finishing uphill. This idea was discarded because it was required to have two finish sections which was not possible from a logistical and financial point of view.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/no-uphill-time-trial-at-ponferrada-worlds|title=No uphill time trial at Ponferrada Worlds |date=21 November 2013|accessdate=18 April 2014|publisher=cyclingnews.com[/tpl]
