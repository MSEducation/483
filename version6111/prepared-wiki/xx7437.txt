Martial arts film is a film genre. A sub-genre of the action film, martial arts films contain numerous martial arts fights between characters, usually as the films' primary appeal and entertainment value, and often as a method of storytelling and character expression and development. Martial arts are frequently featured in training scenes and other sequences in addition to fights. Martial arts films commonly include other types of action, such as stuntwork, chases, and/or gunfights.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.newsweek.com/2003/07/23/the-problem-with-fx.html|title= The Problem With Fx |accessdate=2010-07-04 |work= Newsweek|publisher= |date= [/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= Martial Arts Pics--packing A Hard Punch|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1986-04-20|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-04-20/entertainment/ca-1348_1_martial-arts-film|accessdate=2010-09-04 | first=Lewis | last=Beale[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= Martial arts moves get a hip-hop flair|publisher= Christian Science Monitor|date=|url= http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0307/p16s02-almo.html|accessdate=2010-12-15[/tpl]

==History==

As with other action films, martial arts films are dominated by action to varying degrees; many martial arts films have only a minimal plot and amount of character development and focus almost exclusively on the action, while other martial arts films have more creative and complex plots and characters along with action scenes.[tpl]cite news|title= FILM; Martial-Arts Movies Find a Home In South Africa |publisher= New York Times|date=1992-02-23|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/23/movies/film-martial-arts-movies-find-a-home-in-south-africa.html?scp=2&sq=american%20ninja&st=cse&pagewanted=2|accessdate=2010-12-05 | first=Celia | last=Wren[/tpl] Films of the latter type are generally considered to be artistically superior films, but many films of the former type are commercially successful and well received by fans of the genre.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.newsweek.com/1999/04/19/maximizing-the-matrix.html#|title= Maximizing The Matrix |accessdate=2010-07-04 |work= Newsweek|publisher= |date= [/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dgzACTHIAcsC&pg=PA80&dq=martin+riggs+martial+arts&hl=en&ei=IGziTdLfEpGr8APZr-GABw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=martin%20riggs%20martial%20arts&f=false|title=Film genre 2000: new critical essays|accessdate=2011-09-08[/tpl]
Martial arts films contain many characters who are martial artists, and these roles are often played by actors who are real martial artists. If not, actors frequently train in preparation for their roles, or the action director may rely more on stylized action or film making tricks like camera angles, editing, doubles, undercranking, wire work, and computer-generated imagery. Trampolines and springboards can also be used to increase the height of jumps. These techniques are sometimes used by real martial artists as well, depending on the style of action in the film.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.newsweek.com/2003/07/23/the-problem-with-fx.html|title= The Problem With Fx |accessdate=2010-12-16 |work= Newsweek|publisher= |date= [/tpl]
During the 1970s and 1980s, the most visible presence of martial arts films was the hundreds of English dubbed kung fu and ninja films produced by the Shaw Brothers, Godfrey Ho, and other Hong Kong producers. These films were widely  broadcast on North American television on weekend timeslots that were often colloquially known as Kung Fu Theater, Black Belt Theater, or variations thereof. Inclusive in this list of films are commercial classics like The Big Boss, Drunken Master, and One Armed Boxer.
Martial arts films have been produced all over the world, but the genre has been dominated by Hong Kong action cinema, peaking from 1971 with the rise of Bruce Lee until the mid-1990s with a general decline in the industry.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/23/sports/23karate.html|title=Contender Shores Up Karate’s Reputation Among U.F.C.

Other notable figures in the genre include Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao, and Donnie Yen.
Sonny Chiba has appeared with karate and jidaigeki from Japan of the 1970s. Hollywood has also participated in the genre with actors such as Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Brandon Lee (son of Bruce Lee), Wesley Snipes, Gary Daniels, Mark Dacascos, and Jason Statham.[tpl]cite news|title= Revenge of kungfu Martial arts films are socking away the dough|publisher= Chicago Tribune|date=1992-11-15|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-11-15/entertainment/9204130690_1_martial-arts-kung-fu-tv-series-bruce-lee|accessdate=2010-12-15|first=Lewis|last=Beale[/tpl] In the 2000s, Thailand's film industry became an international force in the genre with the films of Tony Jaa,[tpl]cite news|title= Hitting the Big Time|work=Time|date=2004-10-18|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,725168,00.html|accessdate=2010-12-15|first=Andrew|last=Perrin[/tpl] and the Cinema of Vietnam followed suit with The Rebel and Clash.

==Subgenres==

Kung fu films are a significant movie genre in themselves. Like westerns for Americans, they have become an identity of Chinese cinema. As the most prestigious movie type in Chinese film history, Kung Fu movies were among the first Chinese films produced and the wuxia period films(武俠片) are the original form of Chinese Kung Fu films. The wuxia period films came into vogue due to the thousands of years popularity of wuxia novels(武俠小說). For example, Jin Yong[tpl]cite news|title= Jin Yong and Chinese Martial Arts Novels|publisher= Hong Kong Films Free Web|date=|url= http://hkfilms.150m.com/Chinese/jinyong.htm[/tpl] and Gu Long,[tpl]cite news|title= Kung Fu (Wuxia) Novels Translation|publisher= Lannyland|date=|url= http://www.lannyland.com/translations.shtml[/tpl] their wuxia novels directly led to the prevalence of wuxia period films. The 
most famous wuxia film made was the Ang Lee masterpiece Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which was based on the Wang Dulu series of wuxia novels: it earned four Academy Awards, including one for Best Foreign Film.
In Chinese-speaking world, martial arts films are commonly divided into two subcategories - the wuxia  period films(武俠片), and the more modern Kung fu films(功夫片, best epitomized in the films of Bruce Lee).[tpl]cite news|title= Everybody is kung fu fighting|publisher= MSNBC|date=|url= http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6612102/site/todayshow/ns/today-entertainment/|accessdate=2010-12-17[/tpl]
