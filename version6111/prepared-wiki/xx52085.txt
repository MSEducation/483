==Early life==

Furyk was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania. His father Mike was an assistant pro at the Edgmont Country Club and later also spent time as a pro at West Chester Golf and Country Club as well as Hidden Springs Golf Course in Horsham. His early years were spent in the Pittsburgh suburbs learning the game from his father, who was head pro at Uniontown Country Club. He graduated from Manheim Township High School in Lancaster County in 1988, where he played basketball in addition to being a state champion golfer. He played his junior golf at Meadia Heights Golf Club just south of Lancaster city. He played college golf at the University of Arizona in Tucson, where he was an All-American twice and led the Wildcats to their first (and only) NCAA title in 1992.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arizonawildcats.com/sports/m-golf/spec-rel/090412aac.html |title=Furyk named to Ryder Cup team |date=September 4, 2012 |accessdate=September 25, 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]

==Professional career==

Furyk turned professional in 1992. He won the NIKE Mississippi Gulf Coast Classic on the Nike Tour in 1993. He joined the PGA Tour in 1994 and won at least one tournament each year between 1998 and 2003. At the time, this was the second-best streak of winning seasons behind Tiger Woods and he made the top ten in the Official World Golf Ranking. Furyk's biggest win to date came on June 16, 2003, when he tied the record for the lowest 72-hole score in U.S. Open history to win his first major championship.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
In 2004, he only played in fourteen events after missing three months due to surgery to repair cartilage damage in his wrist; he missed six cuts and his highest finish was T6, which caused him to fall out of the top hundred on the money list. He returned to good form in 2005 and regained his top ten ranking, winning a PGA Tour event in that year and two in 2006. In the 2006 season, he finished a career-high second on the money list and won the Vardon Trophy for the first time. He also had a career-best thirteen top-10 finishes, including nine top-3s, four second-place finishes, and two victories. 
The 2010 season was a banner one for Furyk. After going more than two seasons winless, he won a career-best three tournaments on Tour in 2010: The Transitions Championship, the Verizon Heritage, and the season-ending Tour Championship. His victory in the Tour Championship also earned him the 2010 FedEx Cup after winning by one stroke.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/golf/9034969.stm |title=Jim Furyk edges Luke Donald to win Tour Championship |date=September 27, 2010 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=September 28, 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100929040518/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/golf/9034969.stm |archivedate=September 29, 2010[/tpl] His accomplishments in 2010 won him both the PGA Player of the Year[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pga.com/news/pga/career-feats-jim-furyk-named-pga-player-year-matt-kuchar-earns-first-vardon-trophy |title=Career Feats: Furyk named PGA Player of the Year; Kuchar earns first Vardon Trophy |publisher=PGA of America |date=November 15, 2010 |accessdate=December 20, 2013[/tpl] and PGA Tour Player of the Year for the first time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/news/2010/12/04/playerofyear-furyk.html |title=Furyk named PGA Tour's Player of the Year |publisher=PGA Tour |date=December 4, 2010  |accessdate=December 20, 2013[/tpl]
Since 2012, Furyk has come close on several occasions to winning more titles, but to date has not done so. At the 2012 U.S. Open, Furyk led after 54 holes and was still the leader deep into the final day, before snap hooking his drive into the trees at the 16th which led to a bogey and was followed by another at the 18th. He finished in a tie for fourth, two strokes behind Webb Simpson. At the 2012 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, Furyk led after the first three rounds and looked set to win the championship as he held a one-stroke lead going into the final hole, but a double-bogey cost him the title to Keegan Bradley.[tpl]cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/8237231/keegan-bradley-takes-wgc-bridgestone-invitational-jim-furyk-collapse |title=Keegan Bradley wins after 64 |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=August 6, 2012 |accessdate=December 20, 2013[/tpl] At the 2013 PGA Championship, Furyk led by one stroke going into the final day over Jason Dufner, but this time his lead was overturned on the front nine and he was unable to reduce the deficit as Dufner won by two strokes. Furyk's caddy since 1999 has been Mike "Fluff" Cowan, who was Tiger Woods' caddy for Woods' first two years as a professional.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
On September 13, 2013, Furyk shot a 12-under-par 59 in the second round of the BMW Championship at Conway Farms Golf Club in Lake Forest, Illinois, becoming just the sixth player to shoot 59 in a PGA Tour event.[tpl]cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/9670156/jim-furyk-fires-sixth-59-pga-tour-history-bmw-championship |title=Jim Furyk hits golf's magic mark |work=ESPN |date=September 13, 2013 |accessdate=September 13, 2013[/tpl]

==The swing==

Furyk's trademark looping golf swing begins with a setup that has the ball at the heel of the club instead of the center, or even out at the toe.  This moves his [tpl]height|ft=6|in=2[/tpl] frame in so close that his hands are virtually touching his thighs. Most golfers would have a difficult time with a golf club from such a starting point. Compare Furyk's setup to the more textbook setup of Tiger Woods, who begins with his hands 8 inches or so away from his body, a position that promotes a take-away that will put the golf club over his right shoulder at the top, and keep his right elbow tucked against his body. For a human being, this is the classic launch position. Since the beginning of time it has been used to throw a stone, a spear, a baseball, or swing a club. The big muscles of the body—the back, shoulders and thighs—are in control, not the weaker ones in the hands and wrists. The athlete (or hunter in early times) is said to be "loaded". His entire body is poised in the optimum power position. Furyk, by contrast, takes the club away in the manner of a basketball player shooting a hook shot. His arms move back vertically, and at the top his right elbow "flies away" from his body. Tall players tend toward more upright swings. While this manner of beginning doesn't promote power, it is an early step to facilitate accurate ball-striking. The club's shaft is nearly vertical, like a putter. It moves straight back and straight up, keeping it on path longer, which tends to reinforce in the mind the route along which to bring it back into the ball. At the top of the backswing, Furyk is in the same position as Jack Nicklaus would be—club shaft parallel to the intended line of flight, elbow flying off to who-knows-where. Starting the downswing, Furyk then "corrects" for his unconventional takeaway by dropping his right elbow into the slot where it needs to be, a move that brings the golf club onto the proper swing path to achieve sound results.  It's this downswing beginning that produces the idiosyncratic loop in his swing. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
As Mike Furyk describes in a Golf Digest issue in 2001, Jim Furyk's hips "underturn" during the backswing and "overturn" coming down. On the downswing, he draws the club in a large arc behind his body (viewing from his right hand side), then pastes his elbow against his right hip at impact. Golf commentator Gary McCord has said it looks like Furyk is trying to swing inside a phone booth. Another commentator David Feherty memorably described Furyk's swing as "an octopus falling out of a tree". Others have noted it reminds them of "a one-armed golfer using an axe to kill a snake in a telephone booth."[tpl]cite news |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/golf.cfm?id=1118082007 |title=Patience is pivotal for inconsistent Furyk |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=July 18, 2007[/tpl]
