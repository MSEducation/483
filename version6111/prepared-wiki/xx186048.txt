The Olympic Plaza is an urban park and gathering place in downtown Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Located around Macleod Trail and 7th Avenue S., it was created as the venue for the medal ceremonies at the 1988 Winter Olympic Games.  In 2004, over 30,000 people packed the plaza to celebrate the Calgary Flames run to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals.
Olympic Plaza serves as a meeting place, and an outdoor event area, hosting concerts and festivals.  In the winter, it is used as a public ice skating area.  The plaza is accessible by Calgary's C-Train system at the  City Hall stops.
