Roberto Santamaría Calavia (born 12 March 1962), simply known as Roberto, is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

==Football career==

Born in Pamplona, Navarre, Roberto played 12 professional years at local CA Osasuna, being the team's undisputed starter in eight of those. In the 1986–87 season he contributed with 20 games, but the side barely avoided La Liga relegation.
In the 1990–91 campaign, as Osasuna finished a best-ever fourth place in the top division, Roberto played 3,191 minutes in 36 matches. Two years later he did not concede one single goal for 411 minutes, which stood in the club's record books for more than 20 years. 
However, the emergence of 19-year-old Javier López Vallejo, also groomed at Osasuna, prompted his exit in 1995 at the age of 33, to third level's Málaga CF, and he closed out his career after two more seasons. He then returned to his first club, acting as goalkeeper coach for both the first and second teams.

==Personal==

Roberto's nephew, Roberto Santamaría Ciprián, was also a footballer and a goalkeeper. He too represented Osasuna and Málaga.Santamaría: "De verdad, lo mío con los penaltis es cuestión de suerte" (Santamaría: "Really, my thing with penalties is a matter of luck"); Marca, 4 November 2008 [tpl]es icon[/tpl]
