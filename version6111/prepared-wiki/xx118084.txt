The North Korean produced M1973 Sinhung VTT-323 is a licensed copy of the Chinese YW531 Armored Personnel Carrier.

The VTT-323 has five road wheels and a turret mounting 14.5mm and 7.62mm machine guns, or a turret with twin 14.5-mm guns. Some versions have Susong-Po (AT-3 Sagger variant) antitank guided missile launcher and SA-7 or SA-16 man-portable SAM. 
The VTT-323 is nicknamed the VET. The VET has a crew of four, consisting of a commander, gunner, loader and a driver. The vehicle can carry ten fully equipped infantrymen. In mechanized battalions, it is also used to mount 82mm mortars to form self-propelled batteries. The VTT-323 has been observed with a 107mm multiple rocket launcher (MRL) mounted on the rear. The VTT-323 has become the NKPA standard armored personnel carrier. It is organic to mechanized battalions of mechanized and armored brigades.
