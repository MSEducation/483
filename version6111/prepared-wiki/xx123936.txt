[[Tuberculotae]]

CATEGORIES: Mygalomorphae

The Tuberculotae are an infraorder of mygalomorph spiders, consisting of eight families with ca. 250 genera and 1,800 species.
They are opposed to the Fornicephalae, which make up the rest of the Mygalomorphae. The key difference being the unique sensory hairs that have developed on their ommatidia primarily used for orientation in low light areas.
However, according to (Goloboff, 1993), neither group appears to be monophyletic.
