==Background==

Oritz was born in Huntington Beach, California where he lived until he moved to Santa Ana, California at the age of five, and was given the nickname "Tito" by his father, Sam, when he was only a year old. Ortiz is of half-Mexican from his paternal side, Hawaiian descent on his maternal side, and has four older brothers. Ortiz had a difficult childhood as both of his parents were addicted to heroin, while Ortiz was involved with street gangs, was placed in juvenile halls, and experimented with drugs such as cocaine and PCP. His parents divorced when he was 13 years old, and his mother took the young Ortiz with her back to Huntington Beach. When he was only seven years old, Ortiz supported himself by selling fish that he caught at a local pier and later attended Huntington Beach High School, where he began wrestling during his sophomore year and excelled at the sport, winning a CIF championship at 189 pounds, and finished fourth in the state tournament as a senior. When Ortiz was 18 years old, his mother kicked him out of the house and he began living with one of his brothers while doing labor work, and later became addicted to methamphetamines. When he was 19 years old, Ortiz ran into an old high school wrestling coach, a future UFC fighter and the head wrestling coach at Golden West College, Paul Herrera, who encouraged him to enroll in the college. Ortiz then began attending Golden West where he was a NJCAA state champion two consecutive years before transferring California State University at Bakersfield, where he continued wrestling but was never a full-time starter. Ortiz also trained with the legendary UFC fighter and fellow collegiate wrestler, Tank Abbott.http://www.oyemag.com/tito.htmlhttp://www.mmajunkie.com/news/2006/12/tito-ortiz-disccuses-troubled-past-drug-addictionhttp://www.titoortiz.com/career.php

==Mixed martial arts==

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===

Ortiz's mixed martial arts debut was at UFC 13 in 1997. Still in college, Ortiz competed as an amateur for no prize money or contracts. He beat Wes Albritton in an alternate bout by referee stoppage at 0:31 of the first round. He was selected to face Guy Mezger in the Light Heavyweight final after Enson Inoue could not continue due to injury.  Despite dominating Mezger at first, Ortiz lost the fight at 2:00 in the first round by a guillotine choke submission. After returning with a TKO victory over Jeremy Screeton at West Coast NHB Championships 1, Ortiz fought top ranked fighter and UFC 12 Light Heavyweight Tournament Champion Jerry Bohlander at UFC 18. Ortiz dominated the fight and won via TKO due to cut stoppage. Ortiz then avenged his loss to Mezger at UFC 19 by TKO. Ortiz's post fight antics towards Mezger and the Lion's Den led to his long running rivalry with the team's leader Ken Shamrock.
Ortiz has credited former UFC Heavyweight Champion Bas Rutten for inspiration during his early days. Ortiz said; "I looked up to Bas Rutten. Bas was my idol. People were just so scared of fighting him, he was like the man. I thought that was what I need to do now. If I train as hard as he does then one day I'll be as good as him and two years later look where I am, I'm on top of the world. I'm got to say thanks to him, (Bas) for helping me out by making me believe in dreams."[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010501002224/sfuk.tripod.com/interviews_01/tito_interview2.html |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2001-05-01 |accessdate=2012-11-07[/tpl]
In 1999, Ortiz fought Frank Shamrock for what is now known as the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship at UFC 22." Despite controlling Shamrock for the majority of the fight, Ortiz ended up losing via submission due to strikes. Following the victory, Shamrock retired and vacated the championship. The Middleweight division was then officially renamed the Light Heavyweight (205 lb) division and Ortiz was chosen, along with Wanderlei Silva, as a top contender. Ortiz defeated Silva for the vacant Light Heavyweight Championship at UFC 25'' via unanimous decision. He went on to defend the Light Heavyweight Championship a record five times in the following three years, defeating Yuki Kondo, Evan Tanner, Elvis Sinosic, Vladimir Matyushenko and Lion's Den head Ken Shamrock.
At UFC 44, after a near year-long layoff from the sport, Ortiz fought the new Interim Light Heavyweight Champion Randy Couture, who had defeated Chuck Liddell for the interim title at UFC 43 in September 2003. Couture defeated Ortiz via unanimous decision. The loss ended Ortiz's near three and a half year title reign, which was the longest Light Heavyweight Championship reign until Jon Jones won his sixth victory while maintaining the Light Heavyweight Championship on September 21, 2013,http://sports.yahoo.com/news/mma--ufc-165-jon-jones-alexander-gustafsson-050257025.html however Tito still holds the record for time reigned with the belt at 1,260 days.UFC Light Heavyweight Championship#Light Heavyweight Championship Following his loss to Couture, Ortiz faced Chuck Liddell at UFC 47, losing by TKO in the second round. After six months off, Ortiz returned and took a unanimous decision victory over newcomer Patrick Côté at UFC 50 and a split decision over Vitor Belfort at UFC 51.
In February 2005, Ortiz took time away from the UFC and was offered deals with several promotions, including PRIDE Fighting Championships and the Don King-backed World Fighting Alliance. Ortiz and fellow fighter Fabiano Iha even hired investment banker Stan Medley to take a new league, The Xtreme Fighting Championship, public. But none of these endeavors came to fruition. Ortiz opted to try his hand at professional wrestling, signing with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling as a guest referee.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wrestlingjournal.netfirms.com/wj200504.html |title=Wrestling Journal 2.4.1 (April 2005) |work=Wrestlingjournal.netfirms.com |date=April 2005 |accessdate=January 19, 2009[/tpl]
In November 2005, UFC president Dana White announced Ortiz and Ken Shamrock would coach The Ultimate Fighter 3 reality TV series on Spike TV, which premiered in April 2006. Ortiz's first fight in his return occurred at UFC 59 on April 15, 2006, against previous The Ultimate Fighter 1 winner Forrest Griffin. Ortiz won via split decision. His next fight was against UFC Hall of Famer Ken Shamrock at UFC 61 on July 8, 2006, a match which was to conclude a main rivalry on The Ultimate Fighter 3. Shamrock lost in the first round by TKO due to strikes (elbows) by Ortiz. On August 25, 2006, at the UFC 62 weigh-ins, Dana White announced a rematch between Ortiz and Shamrock for October 10, 2006, on Spike TV, as the main event of Ortiz vs. Shamrock 3: The Final Chapter. Ortiz beat Shamrock for the third time in this fight, which was stopped in the first round due to strikes. On December 30, 2006, at UFC 66, Ortiz's rematch with Chuck Liddell (for the UFC Light Heavyweight championship) ended in defeat via referee stoppage in the third round.[tpl]cite web|url= http://mmaweekly.com/ufc-66-review-ice-age-continues-as-liddell-beats-ortiz-2 |title=UFC 66 REVIEW: ICE AGE CONTINUES AS LIDDELL BEATS ORTIZ |work=MMAWeekly.com|date=December 30, 2006 |accessdate=October 20, 2010[/tpl]

===Outside the UFC===

After leaving the UFC, Ortiz was approached by multiple promotions, including the now defunct EliteXC, Affliction and the American Fight League. However, a clause in his old UFC contract forbade him from signing with or fighting for any other organization until approximately April–June 2009. Until his return to the UFC, Ortiz was considered the biggest free agent on the market.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mmaopinion.com/2008/10/20/free-agency-in-mma-tito-and-antwain/ |title=Free Agency in MMA: Tito and Antwain |date=October 20, 2008 |first=Curtis |last=Clontz |work=MMAOpinion.com |accessdate=January 19, 2009[/tpl]
