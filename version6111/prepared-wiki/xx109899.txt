==Vinohrady==

The historical center of Vinohrady, with its expensive apartment buildings from the late 19th and early 20th century, also falls under the jurisdiction of Prague 2.The popularity of this district as a residential area is not based only on the beauty of the facades, tidiness of the streets, but also for its ranking among the top in Prague in the area of gastronomic services in terms of quality and quantity.
