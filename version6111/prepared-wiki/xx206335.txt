Baker Congregational Church is a historic Congregational church at 760 Saratoga Street in East Boston, Massachusetts.

==History==

With the growth of East Boston as a settlement in 1834, a need was seen for a church and meetinghouse for the inhabitants.  The church was founded and dedicated on November 17, 1852 as the Maverick Church Chapel by the Maverick Congregational Society on land given by the East Boston Company.  It was the fourth iteration of the church founded in East Boston under the name First Congregational Church in East Boston, which on July 7, 1837, was changed to Maverick Congregational Church by the Society's majority shareholders.[tpl]cite book |last=Maverick Congregational Church |first= |authorlink= |title=Condensed History and Manual of Maverick Congregational Church |url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=vssrAAAAYAAJ |year=1894 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=82 |pages=[/tpl]
Today it known also as the Baker-Maverick Congregational Church or Grace Church Federated.  The shingle style church was built in 1903 by John Nelson Thisland and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
