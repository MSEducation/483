==Career==

In 1941, he appeared in  three-minute musicals produced for the Soundies film jukeboxes. Montalbán appeared in many of the New York–produced Soundies as an extra or as a member of a singing chorus (usually billed as Men and Maids of Melody), although he had the lead role in He's a Latin from Staten Island (1941), in which the young Latin (billed simply as "Ricardo") played the title role of a guitar-strumming gigolo, accompanied by an offscreen vocal by Gus Van.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/topic/Ricardo_Montalban/wiki/|title=Topic: Ricardo Montalban|publisher=UPI|accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] Late in 1941, Montalbán returned to Mexico after learning that his mother was dying. There, he acted in a dozen Spanish-language films and became a star in his homeland.
Montalbán recalled that when he arrived in Hollywood in 1943, studios wanted to change his name to Ricky Martin.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b1xi414MLI |title=2002 Archive Interview of Ricardo Montalbán, Part 1 of 5 |publisher=Youtube.com |accessdate=2012-03-29[/tpl] His first leading role was in the film Border Incident (1949) with actor George Murphy. He was the first Hispanic actor to appear on the front cover of Life magazine on November 21, 1949. During the 1950s and 1960s, he was one of only a handful of actively working Hispanic actors in Hollywood, although he portrayed several ethnicities – occasionally of Japanese background, as in with the character of Nakamura in the film  Sayonara (1957), and as Tokura in the Hawaii Five-O episode "Samurai" (1968). 
Many of his early roles were in Westerns in which he played character parts, usually as an "Indian" or as a "Latin Lover", but.he was cast against type in the film Mystery Street (1950), playing a Cape Cod police officer. From 1957 to 1959, he starred in the Broadway musical Jamaica, singing several light-hearted calypso numbers opposite Lena Horne.
Montalbán starred in radio, such as the internationally syndicated program "Lobo del Mar" (Seawolf), in which he was cast as the captain of a vessel which became part of some adventure at each port it visited. This 30-minute weekly show aired in many Spanish-speaking countries until the early 1970s. In 1972, Montalbán co-founded the Screen Actors Guild Ethnic Minority Committee with actors Carmen Zapata, Henry Darrow and Edith Diaz.[tpl]cite news|first=|last=|title=Actress Edith Diaz dies at 70; Credits include 'Sister Act' films and CBS' 'Popi' sitcom |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ib96053a9e47796d757c159ec4834e12a |work=Hollywood Reporter|publisher=|date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-18[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In 1975, he was chosen as the television spokesman for the new Chrysler Cordoba. The car became a successful model, and over the following several years, was heavily advertised; his mellifluous delivery of a line praising the "soft Corinthian leather" upholstery of the car's interior, often misquoted as "fine" or "rich Corinthian leather", became famous and was much parodied, and Montalbán subsequently became a favorite subject of impersonators. Eugene Levy, for example, frequently impersonated him on SCTV. (In deference to American habits, he deliberately misstressed the car's name on the second syllable.) In 1986, he was featured in a magazine advertisement for the new Chrysler New Yorker.  
Montalbán's best-known television role was that of Mr. Roarke in the television series Fantasy Island, which he played from 1977 until 1984. For a while, the series was one of the most popular on television, and his character as well as that of his sidekick, Tattoo (played by Hervé Villechaize), became pop icons. 
Another of his well-known roles was that of Khan Noonien Singh in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, in which he reprised a role that he had originated in the 1967 episode of Star Trek titled "Space Seed". Early rumors suggested Montalbán wore prosthetic muscles on his chest during filming of Star Trek II to appear more muscular. Director Nicholas Meyer replied that even in his sixties Montalbán had a vigorous training regimen, was "one strong cookie," and that his real chest was seen on film. Khan's costume was specifically designed to display Montalbán's physique. Critic Christopher Null called Khan the "greatest role of Montalbán's career". 
New Yorker critic Pauline Kael said Montalbán's performance as Khan "was the only validation he has ever had of his power to command the big screen."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.metroactive.com/metro/01.14.09/film-moviesnews-0902.html |newspaper=Metroactive |first=Richard|last=von Busack|title=Ricardo Montalban Remembered|date=February 2009| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/671DW21cs |archivedate=2012-04-18[/tpl] Montalbán agreed to take the role for a significant pay cut, since by his own admission, he relished reprising the role, and his only regret was that he and William Shatner never interacted – the characters never meet face to face, except through video communication – as their scenes were filmed several months apart in order to accommodate Montalbán's schedule for Fantasy Island.[tpl]cite news|last=Muñoz|first=Lorenza|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-montalban15-2009jan15,0,4099069,full.story|accessdate=April 18, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 15, 2009|title=Ricardo Montalban dies at 88; 'Fantasy Island' actor[/tpl] When Montalbán guest-starred in the Family Guy episode "McStroke" as a genetically engineered cow, his character made several references to his role as Khan, and similar references were made in his role as Guitierrez in the cartoon series Freakazoid.
Montalbán appeared in many diverse films including The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! as well as two films from both the Planet of the Apes and Spy Kids series. In addition, he appeared in various musicals, such as The Singing Nun (1966), also starring Debbie Reynolds. Over the course of his long career, he played lead roles or guest-starred in dozens of television series.  Montalbán also narrated several historical documentaries including the Spanish version of the National Park Service's history of Pecos Pueblo for Pecos National Historical Park.
Prior to his death in January 2009, Montalbán recorded the voice for a guest character in an episode of the animated TV series American Dad!, in which main character Roger becomes the dictator of a South American country. According to executive producer Mike Barker, it was his last role.TV Guide; September 14, 2009; p. 63

===Injury===

During the filming of the 1951 film, Across the Wide Missouri, Montalbán was thrown from his horse, knocked unconscious, and trampled by another horse, which aggravated his Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) and resulted in a traumatic back injury that never healed. The pain increased as he aged, and in 1993, Montalbán underwent 9½ hours of spinal surgery that left him paralysed below the waist and using a wheelchair. Despite constant pain, the actor persevered; he performed and provided voices for animated films and supported his Nosotros foundation. Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez created the role "Grandfather" specifically for Montalbán in his Spy Kids film series, including a jet-propelled wheelchair.[tpl]cite web|last=Brennan|first= Sandra |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/ricardo-montalban|publisher= All Movie Guide |title= Ricardo Montalban[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mahalo.com/Ricardo_Montalban |title=Mahalo Answers: Ricardo Montalban |publisher=Mahalo.com |accessdate=2012-03-29[/tpl][tpl]dubious|date=March 2012[/tpl][tpl]unreliable source|date=September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/748/000022682/ |title=Ricardo Montalban |publisher=NNDB |accessdate=2012-03-29[/tpl]

==Personal life==

He married Georgiana Young (née Georgiana Paula Belzer; September 10, 1924–November 13, 2007), who had a brief acting and modeling career, in 1944; they had four children: Laura, Mark, Anita and Victor.[tpl]cite web|last=Evanier|first= Mark |url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2009_01_14.html |work= News From Me Archives |title= Wednesday January 14, 2009 - Ricardo Montalban, R.I.P.[/tpl] Georgiana was the half-sister of the actresses Sally Blane, Polly Ann Young, and movie and television star Loretta Young, who nicknamed her "Georgie". After sixty-three years of marriage, she died at the age of 83, on November 13, 2007, from undisclosed causes, preceding her husband by fourteen months.
Montalbán was a practicing Roman Catholic and once had said that his religion was the "most important thing" in his life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.catholicweb.com/media_index.cfm?fuseaction=view_article&partnerid=18&article_id=547|publisher=CatholicWeb.com|title=Ricardo Montalbán receives first Spirit of Angelus Award at student film festival|accessdate=2008-10-24[/tpl] He was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California.Church of the Good Shepherd: Our History In 1998, Pope John Paul II made him a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great (KSG),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greeleynet.com/~maxalla/OKHSSub/Gallantry.html|author=Worley, Lloyd |title=Gallantry Magazine Online |publisher=The Religious and Military Order of Knights of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem|date=January 1998 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040824140201/http://www.greeleynet.com/~maxalla/OKHSSub/Gallantry.html |archivedate=2004-08-24 |accessdate=March 29, 2012[/tpl] the highest honor a Roman Catholic lay person can receive from the Church.

==Nosotros Foundation==

The way he was asked to portray Mexicans disturbed him, so Montalbán, along with Richard Hernandez, Val de Vargas, Rodolfo Hoyos Jr., Carlos Rivas, Tony de Marco and Henry Darrow established the Nosotros ("We") Foundation in 1970 to advocate for Latinos in the movie and television industry.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-montalban15-2009jan15,0,4189863.story |title=Ricardo Montalban dies at 88; 'Fantasy Island' star |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |first=Lorenza |last=Muñoz[/tpl] He served as its first president and was quoted as saying:[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/15/news/obits.1-407992.php |title=Ricardo Montalban, early Latino leading man, dies|author=Dederer, Claire; Weber, Bruce |work=International Herald Tribune|date= January 15, 2009[/tpl]
The foundation created the Golden Eagle Awards, an annual awards show that highlights Latino actors. The awards are presented in conjunction with the Nosotros American Latino Film Festival (NALFF), held at the Ricardo Montalbán Theatre in Hollywood.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.latinheat.com/news.php?nid=698 |publisher=Latin Heat Online |date=June 16, 2006 |title=Ricardo Montalbán presents the Nosotros American Latino Film Festival |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060826124525/http://www.latinheat.com/news.php?nid=698 |archivedate=2006-08-26 |accessdate=March 29, 2012[/tpl]

==Ricardo Montalbán Theatre==

The Nosotros Foundation and the Ricardo Montalbán Foundation agreed to purchase the Doolittle Theatre in 1999 from UCLA. The theater was owned by Howard Hughes in the early 1930s then later renamed the Huntington Hartford Theater when purchased in 1954 by philanthropist Huntington Hartford,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2004/12/hartford200412|publisher=Vanity Fair|title=Hostage to Fortune|author=Suzanna Andrews|accessdate=2012-01-22[/tpl] the Doolittle Theater and then the Ricardo Montalban Theatre. The process from agreement to opening took over four years. The facility in Hollywood was officially renamed the Ricardo Montalbán Theatre in a May 11, 2004 ceremony. The event was attended by numerous celebrities, including Ed Begley Jr., representing the Screen Actors Guild (SAG); Valerie Harper, Loni Anderson, Hector Elizondo and Robert Goulet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/5521.html |title=Star Trek website: May 8, 2004-Crowds Gather to Inaugurate Montalbán Theatre |publisher=Startrek.com |accessdate=2012-03-29[/tpl]
When Montalbán rolled onto the stage in his wheelchair, he repeated "the five stages of the actor" that he famously stated in several interviews and public speeches:  
He then jokingly added two more stages: 
Montalbán then spoke about the goal of the Nosotros organization:[tpl]quotation|Mexico is my mother; the United States the best friend I will ever have. And so I dream of the day when my mother will say, 'Ricardo, you have chosen a wonderful friend.' And the day when the friend will say, 'Ricardo, you have a sensational mother.' That is why it is very important to bring us together. Brothers and sisters, love thy neighbor as thyself. And this theatre, I think, can be a little grain of sand towards that end. Here we have opened the doors not only for the opportunity of young talent to develop—writers, directors, actors—but also in coming together as a group in this society in which we live. Let's open a hand of friendship and love and brotherhood. That is my dream. I'll never see it complete while I'm still alive, but I think this is the beginning, and that is what makes me so happy to see this come to fruition.[/tpl]

==Death==

Montalbán died on January 14, 2009, at his home in the Los Angeles Area, at age 88. According to his son-in-law Gilbert Smith, Montalbán died of "complications from advancing age". His cause of death was later revealed to be congestive heart failure.[tpl]cite news|date=January 15, 2008|title=Mexican-American actor Ricardo Montalbán dies at 88| publisher=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/2009/01/14/2009-01-14_mexicanamerican_actor_ricardo_montalban_.html|accessdate=2009-01-15[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Claire |last=Dederer|authorlink=|coauthors=Weber, Bruce |title=Ricardo Montalban, early Latino leading man, dies|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/world/americas/15iht-obits.1.19382219.html |work=The New York Times |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-28 |publisher=The New York Times Company[/tpl] He is buried next to his wife of 63 years in Culver City's Holy Cross Cemetery.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=32923607|title=Ricardo Montalban (1920 - 2009) - Find A Grave Memorial|author=findagrave.com|date=14 January 2009|accessdate=2 August 2011[/tpl]
