==Strasbourg nobility==

The Zorns are also an old Strasbourg patrician family, which is amongst the oldest noble families in Alsace.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]  The Zorns were kinsmen of the Riplin family, who are first recorded in 1197 through "Burcardus qui dicitur Riplin". The family were widespread in the free Imperial city of Strasbourg and in all of Alsace. In 1253, the sons of the Strasbourg city councillor Hugo Ripelinus — the head of the familial line — are given as Nicolaus, known as "Zorn" (mentioned 1252-1295), and Rulin Ripel (mentioned 1253-1305).[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Nikolaus Zorn, who became city councillor in 1258 and Burgrave of Strasbourg in 1281, is the originator of (amongst others) the Zorn-Engelbrecht, Zorn-Hageneck, Zorn-Schultheiß, Zorn von Wiehersberg, and Zorn von Plobsheim families. They were named either after their mothers, their ancestral seat, or the office of Schultheiß of Strasbourg, which they exercised. Nikolaus Zorn's brother Rulin, who was made the 73rd mayor of Strasbourg in 1263, was the father of the Rulenderin family and, through his son Hugo, who was knighted in 1300, the Zorn von Bulach family.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Over the course of the years, further lines formed, including the families of Weißzorn, Zorn zum Riedt, Zorn zu Ryneck, and Jungzorn. The families of Bilgerin von Ehrenheim, Schenck von Hagenau, Schöneck, and Turant had the same coats of arms, but with different crests.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
The names "Riplin" (Rüpel in German translates as "ruffian") and "Zorn" (wrath) might point to a violent disposition, which is supported by several feuds that were waged. The fiercest of these was on 20 May 1332, a bloody street battle between the Zorns and another important noble family of Strasbourg, the Müllenheims, in which seven noblemen of the Zorn group were killed. Due to the rivalry between the two families, the town hall had two entrances, one each for the Müllenheims and the Zorns. The two banks of the river Ill were likewise named after the two families: the Quai Müllenheim and the Quai Zorn.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Up until the 18th century, the Zorns played a prominent role in the city council. They owned extensive property in the city and its surrounding areas, and were related by marriage to several noble families.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
The Zorn von Bulach family's rank of Freiherren (barons), held by customary law, was officially confirmed in 1773 by their sovereign ruler. The lords of Zorn belonged in the 16th and 17th centuries to the Imperial Knights in the Knight Canton Odenwald. Members of the Zorn von Bulach line were in the 18th and 19th centuries were matriculated in the Knight Canton Neckar-Schwarzwald (of the Swabian knight county), and from 1660 in the knight county of Lower Alsace due to their possession of Enzheim, Gerstheim, and Osthausen.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl] The Zorn von Plobsheim members were also members of the knight county of Lower Alsace from the 17th to the 18th centuries.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
In the church of St. Pierre Le Jeune in Strasbourg, there is a chapel from 1320 which is named after the family.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
