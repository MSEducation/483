Lamarr was also a contract star of MGM's "Golden Age.""Hedy Lamarr: Secrets of a Hollywood Star". Edition Filmmuseum 40. Edition Filmmuseum.com. When she worked with Max Reinhardt in Berlin, he called her the "most beautiful woman in Europe" due to her "strikingly dark exotic looks", a sentiment widely shared by her audiences and critics.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/books/review/Haskell-t.html?pagewanted=all|title=European Exotic|first=Molly|last=Haskell|publisher=New York Times|date=10 December 2010|accessdate=26 July 2012[/tpl]"Hedy Lamarr - Biography".

She gained fame after starring in Gustav Machatý's Ecstasy, a 1933 film which featured closeups of her character during orgasm in one scene, as well as full frontal nude shots of her in another scene, both very unusual for the socially conservative period in which the bulk of her career took place.

==Early life==

Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler in 1914  in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, the only child of Gertrud "Trude" Kiesler (née Lichtwitz; 3 February 1894 – 27 February 1977) and Emil Kiesler (27 December 1880 – 14 February 1935). Her mother was a pianist and Budapest native who came from the "Jewish haute bourgeoisie". Stephen Michael Shearer, a Lamarr biographer, asserts that Lamarr's mother had converted from Judaism to Catholicism and was a "practicing Christian". Lamarr's father a banker, was a secular Jew born in Lemberg.[tpl]cite book|last=Shearer|first=Stephen Michael|title=Beautiful: The Life of Hedy Lamarr|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|year=2010|isbn=978-0-312-55098-1|ref=Shearer[/tpl]

==Film career==

===Europe===

In early 1933, at age 18, she starred in Gustav Machatý's film, Ecstasy, (Extase in German and Czech), which was filmed in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Lamarr’s role was that of a neglected young wife married to an indifferent older man. The film became notorious for Lamarr's face in the throes of orgasm filmed in close-up and brief nude scenes in which she is seen swimming and running through the woods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~reeiweb/events/2009/Ecstasy_poster.pdf|title=Czech Film Series 2009-2010 - Gustav Machatý:Ecstasy|publisher=Russian & East European Institute, Indiana University|date=2 September 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090911064906/http://www.indiana.edu/~reeiweb/events/2009/Ecstasy_poster.pdf|archivedate=11 September 2009|accessdate=9 November 2013[/tpl]
Friedrich Mandl, her first husband, objected to what he felt was exploitation of his wife, and "the expression on her face" during the simulated orgasm. He purportedly bought up as many copies of Ecstasy as he could find in an attempt to restrict its public viewing. In an autobiography of Lamarr written in later years, she insists that all sexual activity in the film was simulated; the orgasm achieved using "method acting reality". The authenticity of passion was attained by the film director's off-screen manipulation of a safety pin strategically poking her bottom. The 19-year old Lamarr had married Mandl on 10 August 1933. Mandl, reputed to be the third richest man in Austria, was a munitions manufacturer. In her autobiography Ecstasy and Me, Lamarr described Mandl as extremely controlling, preventing her from pursuing her acting career and keeping her a virtual prisoner, confined to their castle home, Schloss Schwarzenau. Although half-Jewish, Mandl had close social and business ties to the fascist governments of Italy and Germany,  selling munitions to Mussolini.
In her memoir, Ecstasy and Me, Lamarr wrote that Mussolini and Hitler had attended lavish parties hosted at the Mandl home. Mandl had Lamarr accompany him to business meetings where he conferred with scientists and other professionals involved in military technology. These conferences became Lamarr's introduction to the field of applied science and the ground that nurtured her latent talent in the scientific field.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Lamarr's marriage to Mandl became unbearable and she devised a ruse to separate herself from both the marriage and the country. In Ecstasy and Me, she claimed to have disguised  herself as her own maid and fled to Paris. Rumors stated that Lamarr persuaded Mandl to let  her wear all of her jewelry for a dinner, then disappeared.[tpl]cite book|title=City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s|publisher=University of California Press|author=Friedrich, Otto|year=1997|edition=reprint|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|pages=12–13|isbn=0520209494[/tpl]

===Hollywood===

First she went to Paris, then met Louis B. Mayer in London. Mayer hired her and insisted that she change her name to Hedy Lamarr—she had been known as "the Ecstasy lady"[tpl]r|friedrich1997[/tpl]—choosing the surname in homage to a beautiful film star of the silent era, Barbara La Marr, who had died in 1926 from tuberculosis. She received good reviews for her American film debut in Algiers (1938) with Charles Boyer, who asked that  Lamarr be cast after meeting her at a party.[tpl]r|friedrich1997[/tpl]
In Hollywood, she was invariably cast as the archetypal glamorous seductress of exotic origins. Lamarr played opposite the era's most popular leading men. Her many films include Boom Town (1940) with Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, Comrade X with Gable, White Cargo (1942),  Tortilla Flat (1942) with Tracy and John Garfield, H. M. Pulham, Esq. (1941) with Robert Young, and Dishonored Lady (1947). In 1941, Lamarr was cast alongside Lana Turner and Judy Garland  in Ziegfeld Girl.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
White Cargo, one of Lamarr's biggest hits at MGM, contains, arguably, her most memorable film quote delivered with hints of a provocative invitation: "I am Tondelayo. I make tiffin for you?"  Lamarr made 18 films from 1940 to 1949 even though she had two  children  during that time (in 1945 and 1947). After leaving MGM in 1945, she enjoyed her biggest  success as Delilah in Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah, the highest-grossing film of 1949, with Victor Mature as the Biblical strongman. However, following her comedic turn opposite Bob Hope in My Favorite Spy (1951), her career went into decline. She appeared only sporadically in films after 1950, one of her last roles being that of Joan of Arc in Irwin Allen's critically panned epic, The Story of Mankind (1957).

==Frequency-hopping spread-spectrum invention==

 
Avant garde composer George Antheil (died 1959), a son of German immigrants and a neighbor of Lamarr in California, had experimented with automated control of musical instruments, including his music for Ballet Mécanique, originally written for Fernand Léger's 1924 abstract film. This score involved multiple player pianos playing simultaneously.
During World War II, Antheil and Lamarr discussed the fact that radio-controlled torpedoes, while important in the naval war, could easily be jammed by broadcasting interference at the frequency of the control signal, causing the torpedo to go off course.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] Lamarr had learned something about torpedoes from Mandl. Antheil and Lamarr developed the idea of using frequency hopping to avoid jamming: using a piano roll to unpredictably change the signal sent between a control center and the torpedo at short bursts within a range of 88 frequencies in the radio-frequency spectrum (there are 88 black and white keys on a piano keyboard). The specific code for the sequence of frequencies would be held identically by the controlling ship and in the torpedo. It would be practically impossible for the enemy to scan and jam all 88 frequencies, as this would require too much power or complexity. The frequency-hopping sequence  was controlled by a player-piano mechanism, which Antheill had earlier used to score his Ballet Mecanique.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
On August 11, 1942, [tpl]US patent|2,292,387[/tpl] was granted to Antheil and Hedy Kiesler Markey, Lamarr's married name at the time. This early version of frequency hopping, although novel, soon met with opposition from the U.S. Navy and was not adopted.[tpl]cite web|first=Tony |last=Long |url=http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2011/08/0811hedy-lamar-george-antheil-torpedo-patent|title=This Day in Tech: Aug. 11, 1942: Actress + Piano Player = New Torpedo|publisher=Wired|date=11 August 2011|accessdate= 17 October 2011[/tpl] The idea was not implemented in the US until 1962, when it was used by U.S. military ships during a blockade of Cuba after the patent had expired.  This work was honored in 1997, when the Electronic Frontier Foundation gave Lamarr a belated award for her contributions. In 1998, an Ottawa wireless technology developer, Wi-LAN Inc., acquired a 49% claim to the patent from Lamarr for an undisclosed amount of stock (Eliza Schmidkunz, Inside GNSS).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/303 |title=Player Pianos, Sex Appeal, and Patent #2,292,387|publisher= Inside GNSS|date=September 2006[/tpl]
Lamarr's and Antheil's frequency-hopping idea serves as a basis for modern spread-spectrum communication technology, such as Bluetooth, COFDM (used in Wi-Fi network connections), and CDMA (used in some cordless and wireless telephones).[tpl]cite web|url=http://people.deas.harvard.edu/~jones/cscie129/nu_lectures/lecture7/hedy/lemarr.htm|publisher=MicroTimes|title= The Birth Of Spread Spectrum[/tpl] Blackwell, Martin, and Vernam's 1920 patent[tpl]cite web|last=Blackwell|last2=Martin|last3=Vernam's|title=Secrecy Communication System: patent 1598673|year=1920|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=NIpJAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4&source=gbs_overview_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false[/tpl] seems to lay the communications groundwork for Kiesler and Antheil's patent, which employed the techniques in the autonomous control of torpedoes.
Lamarr wanted to join the National Inventors Council but was reportedly told by NIC member Charles F. Kettering and others that she could better help the war effort by using her celebrity status to sell War Bonds.[tpl]cite journal|authorlink=Robert A.

==Later years==

Lamarr became a naturalized citizen of the United States on 10 April 1953, at age 38. In 1966, she was arrested for shoplifting in Los Angeles. The charges were eventually dropped. In 1991, she was arrested on the same charge in Florida, this time for $21.48 worth of laxatives and eye drops. She pleaded "no contest" to avoid a court appearance, and in return for a promise to refrain from breaking any laws for a year, the charges were once again dropped.Salamone, Debbie (24 October 1991). "Hedy Lamarr Won't Face Theft Charges If She Stays In Line". Orlando Sentinel; retrieved 10 June 2010.
According to her autobiography, Ecstasy and Me (1966), while attempting to flee her husband, Friedrich Mandl, she reputedly slipped into a brothel and hid in an empty room. While her husband searched the brothel, a man entered the room and she had sex with him so she could remain hidden. She was finally successful in escaping when she hired a new maid who resembled her; she drugged the maid and used her uniform as a disguise to escape.Hedy Lamarr, with Leo Guild and  Cy Rice, Ecstasy and Me: My Life as a Woman, New York: Bartholomew House, 1966.
Lamarr later sued the publisher, saying that many of the anecdotes in the book, which was described by a judge as "filthy, nauseating, and revolting," were fabricated by its ghost writer, Leo Guild.[tpl]cite news|title=Hedy Lamarr Loses Fight to Stop Autobiography|agency=Los Angeles Times|newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News|page=12|date=27 September 1966|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&dat=19660927&id=73ohAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SooFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4084,4060061[/tpl]--via Google Newspapers."Hedy Lamarr Loses Suit to Halt Book", The New York Times, 27 September 1966, p. 74. She was also sued in Federal Court by Gene Ringgold, who asserted the  actress's autobiography contained material from an article he wrote in 1965 about her life for a magazine called Screen Facts."Lamarr Autobiography Prompts Plagiarism Suit", The New York Times, 7 February 1967, p. 18.
The publication of her autobiography took place about a year after accusations of shoplifting, and a year after Andy Warhol's short film, Hedy (1966).  The shoplifting charges coincided with a failed attempt to return to the screen in Picture Mommy Dead (1966). The role was ultimately filled by Zsa Zsa Gabor. Ecstasy and Me begins in a despondent mood, with this reference: [tpl]quote|On a recent evening, sitting home alone suffering and brooding about my treatment at the police station because of an incident in a department store, and being replaced by Zsa Zsa Gabor in a motion picture (imagine how that pleased the ego!) I figured out that I had made – and spent – some thirty million dollars. Yet earlier that day I had been unable to pay for a sandwich at Schwab's drug store.[tpl]cite quote|date=March 2014[/tpl][/tpl]
The 1970s were a decade of increasing seclusion for Lamarr. She was offered several scripts, television commercials, and stage projects, but none piqued her interest. In 1974, she filed an invasion of privacy lawsuit for $10 million for an unauthorized use of her name (i.e. "Hedley Lamarr" in Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles); the case was settled out of court. With failing eyesight, she retreated from public life and settled in Miami Beach, Florida in 1981.
For several years beginning in 1997, the boxes of CorelDRAW's software suites were graced by a large Corel-drawn image of Lamarr. The picture won CorelDRAW's yearly software suite cover design contest in 1996. Lamarr sued Corel for using the image without her permission. Corel countered that she did not own rights to the image. The parties reached an undisclosed settlement in 1998.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://hedylamarr.at/news1e.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110706092646/http://hedylamarr.at/news1e.html|date=7 April 1998|title=Hedy Lamarr Sues Corel|archivedate=6 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|publisher=Wired News|date=30 November 1998|title=Corel Caves to Actress Hedy Lamarr|url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/1998/11/16544|last=Sprenger|first=Polly[/tpl]

==Death==

Lamarr died in Casselberry, Florida on 19 January 2000, aged 85. Her death certificate cites three causes: heart failure, chronic valvular heart disease, and arteriosclerotic heart disease. Her death coincided with her daughter Denise's 55th birthday. Her son Anthony Loder took her ashes to Austria and spread them in the Vienna Woods, in accordance with her last wishes.

==Marriages and relationships==

Lamarr was married six times, and had three children, one of whom was adopted:

==Other media appearances==

An Off-Broadway play, Frequency Hopping, features the lives of Lamarr and Antheil. The play was written and staged by Elyse Singer[tpl]Who|date=August 2013[/tpl] in 2008, and the script won a prize for best new play about science and technology from STAGE.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hourglassgroup.org/frequency.html|publisher=Hourglass Group|title=Frequency Hopping|accessdate=11 February 2012[/tpl]
