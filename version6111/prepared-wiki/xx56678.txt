[[Reconstruction conjecture]]

CATEGORIES: Graph theory, Conjectures

Informally, the reconstruction conjecture in graph theory says that graphs are determined uniquely by their subgraphs.  It is due to KellyKelly, P. J., A congruence theorem for trees, Pacific J. Math. 7 (1957), 961–968. and Ulam.Ulam, S. M., A collection of mathematical problems, Wiley, New York, 1960.

==Formal statements==

With these definitions, the conjecture can be stated as:
(The requirement that the graphs have at least three vertices is necessary because both graphs on two vertices have the same decks.)
HararyHarary, F., On the reconstruction of a graph from a collection of subgraphs. In Theory of Graphs and its Applications (Proc. Sympos. Smolenice, 1963). Publ. House Czechoslovak Acad. Sci., Prague, 1964, pp. 47–52. suggested a stronger version of the conjecture:

==Verification==

Both the reconstruction and set reconstruction conjectures have been verified for all graphs with at most 11 vertices (McKayMcKay, B. D., Small graphs are reconstructible, Australas. J. Combin. 15 (1997), 123–126.).

===Reconstructible graph families===

The conjecture has been verified for a number of infinite classes of graphs.

==Recognizable properties==

In context of the reconstruction conjecture, a graph property is called recognizable if one can determine the property from the deck of a graph.  The following properties of graphs are recognizable:

==Reduction==

The reconstruction conjecture is true if all 2-connected graphs are reconstructible Yang Yongzhi:The reconstruction conjecture is true if all 2-connected graphs are reconstructible. Journal of graph theory 12, 237–243 (1988)

==Other structures==

It has been shown that the following are not in general reconstructible:
