Kerbdog (also sometimes known as 'Totally Switched' for the US release) is Kerbdog's eponymous debut album. The album was recorded in 1993 at Rockfield studios in Wales and released in 1994 through Vertigo. Though the band had various indy influences, with bands like Sonic Youth and Big Black, the album ended up having a Metallica influenced proto-grunge sound. The band said that this was simply the result of getting professional equipment, and turning everything up as loud as they could. What also might account for this is the fact that grunge pioneer Jack Endino recorded the album.
The album was fairly well received in Britain, Ireland, and Europe, reaching number 97 in the UK Albums Chart.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_K.HTM | title=UK Top 200 Charts History[/tpl] It also got a lot of radio play on US college radio, but the album didn't do as well as expected.
