==History==

The station signed on the air in November 1977 as KEDY 95.3 in Mount Shasta, California, owned and operated by the Shasta Cascade Broadcasting Corporation, run by  David Rees Sr. It came on the heels of the success of its sister station KWSD-AM 620. The station was taken over by David's son, David Rees Jr. in the 1980s and had played various formats from adult standards to rock and was home to many great radio talents such as Fred "The Big Guy" Gerding Jr., and Rick Martin (former owner/talent of what is now KSIZ). David Jr's sons and daughter, Dennis, Chris, and Tricia also served as on-air talent.
The frequency was moved up to 107.9 FM as the station was sold to Dalmatian Enterprises, Inc., owners of KSYC-AM and FM. KEDY was then sold to Siskiyou Radio Partners, Inc. in 1995 (owned by Tom Huth and Bob Darling), then had the call letters changed to KMJC-FM (MJC stood for "Magic") and the format was changed to oldies as the station was branded "Magic 108".
KMJC-FM was then sold to Four Rivers Broadcasting in 2001, which also purchased sister stations KMJC-AM, KSYC-AM and KSYC-FM. The station was then branded "The Mountain" and played eclectic (or adult album alternative) music. Then, finally the station was picked up by Educational Media Foundation, which operates K-LOVE Radio, in 2004 as Four Rivers also sold its AM stations to Jefferson Public Radio of Ashland, Oregon.
In 2006, the station's call letters were again changed to the current KKLC.
