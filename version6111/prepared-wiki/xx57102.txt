Richard Hakluyt ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|k|l|ʊ|t[/tpl], [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|k|l|ə|t[/tpl], or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|k|əl|w|ɪ|t[/tpl];[tpl]cite web|last=McHenry|first=Patrick|title=Richard Hakluyt|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=1930|publisher=The Literary Encyclopedia|date=2 November 2004|accessdate=21 April 2007[/tpl] c. 1552 or 1553 – 23 November 1616) was an English writer. He is known for promoting the settlement of North America by the English through his works, notably Divers Voyages Touching the Discoverie of America (1582) and The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation (1589–1600).
Hakluyt was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford.  Between 1583 and 1588 he was chaplain and secretary to Sir Edward Stafford, English ambassador at the French court. An ordained priest, Hakluyt held important positions at Bristol Cathedral and Westminster Abbey and was personal chaplain to Sir Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, principal Secretary of State to Elizabeth I and James I. He was the chief promoter of a petition to James I for letters patent to colonize Virginia, which were granted to the London Company and Plymouth Company (referred to collectively as the Virginia Company) in 1606. The Hakluyt Society publishes scholarly editions of primary records of voyages and travels.

==Family, early life and education==

Hakluyt's patrilineal ancestors were of Welsh extraction, rather than Dutch as is often suggested;It has been suggested that the Hakluyts were originally Dutch, but this appears to be a misconception: see the introduction of [tpl]cite book|author=Richard Hakluyt|coauthors=Henry Morley (ed.)|title=Voyager's Tales, from the Collections of Richard Hakluyt|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3752|location=London|publisher=Cassell & Co|year=1880s[/tpl] they appear to have settled in Herefordshire in England around the 13th century, and, according to antiquary John Leland, took their surname from the "Forest of Cluid in Randnorland".[tpl]cite book|author=John Leland|authorlink=John Leland (antiquary)|editor=Lucy Toulmin Smith|editor-link=Lucy Toulmin Smith|chapter=Part V|url=http://archive.org/stream/itineraryofjohnl02lelauoft#page/75/mode/1up|title=The Itinerary of John Leland in or about the Years 1535–1543: Parts IV and V: With an Appendix of Extracts from Leland's Collectanea 2|location=London|publisher=George Bell & Sons|year=1908|pages=33–114 at 75|oclc=697927629|quote=The chefe and auncientest of the Hakcluiths hath bene gentlemen in tymes out of memory, and they toke theyr name of the Forest of Cluid in Randnorland, and they had a castle and habitations not far from Radnor.[/tpl] "Cluid" was possibly a place called Clwyd in Radnorshire; whether this is the same as present-day Clwyd is unknown.

A man named Walter Hakelut was knighted in the 34th year of Edward I (1305) and later killed at the Battle of Bannockburn, and in 1349 Thomas Hakeluyt was chancellor of the diocese of Hereford. Records also show that a Thomas Hakeluytt was in the wardship of Henry VIII (reigned 1509–1547) and Edward VI (reigned 1547–1553).See also Leland, Itinerary of John Leland, p. 75: "From Leonminster to Eyton a mile of by west northe west. One William Hakcluit that was with Kynge Henry the 5. at the batell of Egen Courte set up a house at this village, and purchasyd lands to it. ...

Richard Hakluyt, the second of four sons, was born in either Hereford in the county of Herefordshire around 1552,Quoted in [tpl]cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm (ed.)|authorlink=Hugh Chisholm|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=11th|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1910–1911[/tpl] 29 vols. or in or near London around 1553. Hakluyt's father, also named Richard Hakluyt, was a member of the Worshipful Company of Skinners whose members dealt in skins and furs. He died in 1557 when his son was aged about five years, and his wife Margery followed soon after. Hakluyt's cousin, also named Richard Hakluyt, of the Middle Temple, became his guardian.[tpl]cite web|author=Richard S. Westfall|title=Hakluyt, Richard|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/hakluyt.html|publisher=The Galileo Project|year=1995|accessdate=21 April 2007[/tpl]
While a Queen's Scholar at Westminster School, Hakluyt visited his guardian, whose conversation, illustrated by "certain bookes of cosmographie, an universall mappe, and the Bible", made Hakluyt resolve to "prosecute that knowledge, and kind of literature".Hakluyt's dedication to Sir Francis Walsingham of the work [tpl]cite book|last=Hakluyt|first=Richard|title=The Principall Navigations, Voiages, and Discoveries of the English Nation|location=London|publisher=Imprinted by George Bishop and Ralph Newberie, deputies to Christopher Barker, printer to the Queen's Most Excellent Majestie|year=1589[/tpl] The spelling has been modernized. Entering Christ Church, Oxford,There does not appear to be any monument to Hakluyt either in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, or elsewhere in the grounds of Christ Church, Oxford. in 1570 with financial support from the Skinners' Company, "his exercises of duty first performed", he set out to read all the printed or written voyages and discoveries that he could find. He took his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) on 19 February 1574, and shortly after taking his Master of Arts (M.A.) on 27 June 1577, began giving public lectures in geography. He was the first to show "both the old imperfectly composed and the new lately reformed mappes, globes, spheares, and other instruments of this art". Hakluyt held on to his studentship at Christ Church between 1577 and 1586, although after 1583 he was no longer resident in Oxford.
Hakluyt was ordained in 1578, the same year he began to receive a "pension" from the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers to study divinity. The pension would have lapsed in 1583, but William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, intervened to have it extended until 1586 to aid Hakluyt's geographical research.

==At the English Embassy in Paris==

Hakluyt's first publicationThe Galileo Project errs in identifying Hakluyt's first publication as A Shorte and Briefe Narration of the Two Nauigations and Discoueries to the Northwest Partes Called Newe Fraunce (1580), a translation of Bref Récit et Succincte Narration de la Navigation Faite en MDXXXV et MDXXXVI ([tpl]cite book|author=Jacques Cartier|authorlink=Jacques Cartier|title=Bref Recit et Succincte Narration de la Navigation Faite en 1535 et 1536, par ...

Hakluyt's Voyages brought him to the notice of Lord Howard of Effingham, and Sir Edward Stafford, Lord Howard's brother-in-law. At the age of 30, being acquainted with "the chiefest captaines at sea, the greatest merchants, and the best mariners of our nation", he was selected as chaplain and secretary to accompany Stafford, now English ambassador at the French court, to Paris in 1583. In accordance with the instructions of Secretary Francis Walsingham, he occupied himself chiefly in collecting information of the Spanish and French movements, and "making diligent inquirie of such things as might yield any light unto our westerne discoverie in America". Although this was his only visit to the Continent in his life, he was angered to hear the limitations of the English in terms of travel being discussed in Paris.
The first fruits of Hakluyt's labours in Paris were embodied in his important work entitled A Particuler Discourse Concerninge the Greate Necessitie and Manifolde Commodyties That Are Like to Growe to This Realme of Englande by the Westerne Discoueries Lately Attempted, Written in the Yere 1584, which Sir Walter Raleigh commissioned him to prepare. The manuscript, lost for almost 300 years, was published for the first time in 1877. Hakluyt revisited England in 1584, and laid a copy of the Discourse before Elizabeth I (to whom it had been dedicated) together with his analysis in Latin of Aristotle's Politicks. His objective was to recommend the enterprise of planting the English race in the unsettled parts of North America, and thus gain the Queen's support for Raleigh's expedition. In May 1585 when Hakluyt was in Paris with the English Embassy, the Queen granted to him the next prebendary at Bristol Cathedral that should become vacant,According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, above, the Queen granted Hakluyt the next vacant prebendal stall at Bristol Cathedral two days before his return to Paris. to which he was admitted in 1585 or 1586 and held with other preferments till his death.
Hakluyt's other works during his time in Paris consisted mainly of translations and compilations, with his own dedications and prefaces. These latter writings, together with a few letters, are the only extant material out of which a biography of him can be framed. Hakluyt interested himself in the publication of the manuscript journal of René de Laudonnière, the Histoire Notable de la Florida in Paris in 1586.[tpl]cite book|author=René de Laudonnière|authorlink=René de Laudonnière|coauthors=Martin Basanier (ed.)|title=L'histoire Notable de la Floride ...

Ribault, Descrits par le Capitaine Laudonnière ... à Laquelle a esté Adjousté un Quatriesme Voyage fait par le Capitaine Gourgues|location=Paris|publisher=G. Auvray|year=1586[/tpl] The attention that the book excited in Paris encouraged Hakluyt to prepare an English translation and publish it in London under the title A Notable Historie Containing Foure Voyages Made by Certayne French Captaynes unto Florida (1587). The same year, his edition of Peter Martyr d'Anghiera's De Orbe Nouo Decades Octo saw the light at Paris.At Hakluyt's recommendation, the work was translated into English by Michael Lok and published as [tpl]cite book|author=Petrus Martyr Anglerius|authorlink=Peter Martyr d'Anghiera|title=De Nouo Orbe, or The Historie of the West Indies ...

(supposed to be Francis Gualle); it is the first on which the name "Virginia" appears.

==Return to England==

In 1588 Hakluyt finally returned to England with Lady Stafford, after a residence in France of nearly five years. In 1589 he published the first edition of his chief work, The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation, using eyewitness accounts as far as possible. In the preface to this he announced the intended publication of the first terrestrial globe made in England by Emery Molyneux.
Between 1598 and 1600 appeared the final, reconstructed and greatly enlarged edition of The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation in three volumes. In the dedication of the second volume (1599) to his patron, Sir Robert Cecil, Hakluyt strongly urged the minister as to the expediency of colonizing Virginia. A few copies of this monumental work contain a map of great rarity, the first on the Mercator projection made in England according to the true principles laid down by Edward Wright. Hakluyt's great collection has been called "the Prose Epic of the modern English nation" by historian James Anthony Froude.[tpl]cite book|author=James Anthony Froude|authorlink=James Anthony Froude|title=Essays on History and Literature|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/18276|location=London|publisher=J.M. Dent & Co.|year=1906[/tpl]
On 20 April 1590 Hakluyt was instituted to the rectory of Wetheringsett-cum-Brockford, Suffolk, by Lady Stafford, who was dowager baroness Sheffield. He held this position until his death, and resided in Wetheringsett through the 1590s and frequently thereafter. In 1601 Hakluyt edited a translation from the Portuguese of Antonio Galvão's The Discoveries of the World. In the same yearThe Galileo Project says this took place in 1599. his name occurs as an adviser to the East India Company, in which capacity he supplied them with maps and informed them as to markets.[tpl]citation needed|date = April 2012[/tpl]

==Later life==

In the late 1590s Hakluyt became the client and personal chaplain of Sir Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, Lord Burghley's son, who was to be Hakluyt's most fruitful patron. Hakluyt dedicated to Cecil the second (1599) and third volumes (1600) of the expanded edition of Principal Navigations and also his edition of Galvão's Discoveries (1601). Cecil, who was the principal Secretary of State to Elizabeth I and James I, rewarded him by installing him as prebendary of Westminster Abbey on 4 May 1602.According to Jones's introduction to Hakluyt's Divers Voyages, above, Hakluyt succeeded Dr. Richard Webster as prebendary of Westminster Abbey about 1605. In the following year, he was elected archdeacon of the Abbey.[tpl]citation needed|date = April 2012[/tpl] These religious occupations have occasioned reconsideration of the role played by spiritual concerns in Hakluyt's writings on exploration, settlement, and England's relations with its Catholic rivals.David Harris Sacks, "Richard Hakluyt's Navigations in Time: History, Epic, and Empire," Modern Language Quarterly 67 (2006): 31-62; David A. Boruchoff, "Piety, Patriotism and Empire: Lessons for England, Spain and the New World in the Works of Richard Hakluyt," Renaissance Quarterly 62, no.3 (2009): 809-58.
Hakluyt was married twice, once in or about 1594 and again in 1604. In the licence of Hakluyt's second marriage dated 30 March 1604, he is described as one of the chaplains of the Savoy Hospital; this position was also conferred on him by Cecil. His will refers to chambers occupied by him there up to the time of his death, and in another official document he is styled Doctor of Divinity (D.D.).
Hakluyt was also a leading adventurer of the Charter of the Virginia Company of London as a director thereof in 1589. In 1605 he secured the prospective living of Jamestown, the intended capital of the intended colony of Virginia. When the colony was at last established in 1607, he supplied this benefice with its chaplain, Robert Hunt. In 1606 he appears as the chief promoter of the petition to James I for letters patent to colonize Virginia, which were granted on 10 April 1606. His last publication was a translation of Hernando de Soto's discoveries in Florida, entitled Virginia Richly Valued, by the Description of the Maine Land of Florida, Her Next Neighbour (1609). This work was intended to encourage the young colony of Virginia; Scottish historian William Robertson wrote of Hakluyt, "England is more indebted for its American possessions than to any man of that age."[tpl]cite book|author=William Robertson|authorlink=William Robertson (historian)|title=The History of America|edition=10th|location=London|publisher=Strahan|year=1803[/tpl]
Hakluyt prepared an English translation of Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius' Mare Liberum (1609),[tpl]cite book|author=Hugo Grotius|authorlink=Hugo Grotius|title=Mare Liberum, sive de jure quod Batavis competit ad Indicana commercia dissertatio Free Sea, or, A Dissertation on the Right which Belongs to the Batavians to Take Part in the East Indian Trade|location=Leiden|publisher=Ex officina Ludovici Elzevirij the office of Lodewijk Elzevir|year=1609[/tpl] a treatise that sought to demonstrate that the Dutch had the right to trade freely in the Indies contrary to Spanish and Portuguese claims of sovereignty over the seas,[tpl]cite journal|author=Helen Thornton|title=The Free Sea.

In that year, Hakluyt was a consultant to the Company when it was renewing its charter. Grotius' arguments supported England's right to trade in the Indies.Armitage, "Introduction", The Free Sea: see Thornton, "The Free Sea review". The translation may also have been part of the propaganda encouraging English people to settle in Virginia. In Mare Liberum, Grotius denied that the 1493 donation by Pope Alexander VI that had divided the oceans between Spain and Portugal entitled Spain to make territorial claims to North America. Instead, he stressed the importance of occupation, which was favourable to the English as they and not the Spanish had occupied Virginia. Grotius also argued that the seas should be freely navigable by all, which was useful since the England to Virginia route crossed seas which the Portuguese claimed. However, it is not clear why Hakluyt's translation was not published in his lifetime. George Bruner Parks has theorized that publication at that time would have been inconvenient to England because after England had successfully helped Holland and Spain to negotiate the Twelve Years' Truce during the Eighty Years' War, the work would have supported English claims for free seas against Spain, but not its claims for closed seas against Holland.[tpl]cite book|author=George Bruner Parks|title=Richard Hakluyt and the English Voyages Publication American Geographical Society; no. 10|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=American Geographical Society|year=1928|pages=212[/tpl] Hakluyt's handwritten manuscript, MS Petyt 529, in Inner Temple Library in London was eventually published as The Free Sea for the first time in 2004.
In 1591, Hakluyt inherited family property upon the death of his elder brother Thomas; a year later, upon the death of his youngest brother Edmund, he inherited additional property which derived from his uncle. In 1612 Hakluyt became a charter member of the North-west Passage Company. By the time of his death, he had amassed a small fortune out of his various emoluments and preferments, of which the last was Gedney Rectory, Lincolnshire, presented to him by his younger brother Oliver in 1612. Unfortunately, his wealth was squandered by his only son.
Hakluyt died on 23 November 1616, probably in London, and was buried on 26 November in Westminster Abbey;The burial register merely states that Hakluyt was buried "in the Abbey" without giving an exact location, and there is no monument or gravestone: personal e-mail communication on 10 May 2007 with Miss Christine Reynolds, Assistant Keeper of Muniments, Westminster Abbey Library. by an error in the abbey register his burial is recorded under the year 1626. A number of his manuscripts, sufficient to form a fourth volume of his collections of 1598–1600, fell into the hands of Samuel Purchas, who inserted them in an abridged form in his Pilgrimes (1625–1626).[tpl]cite book|author=Samuel Purchas the Elder|authorlink=Samuel Purchas|title=Purchas His Pilgrimes: In Five Bookes: The First, Contayning the Voyages ...

Others, consisting chiefly of notes gathered from contemporary authors, are preserved at the University of Oxford.Under the reference "Bib. Bod. manuscript Seld. B. 8".
Hakluyt is principally remembered for his efforts in promoting and supporting the settlement of North America by the English through his writings. These works were a fertile source of material for William Shakespeare and other authors. Hakluyt also encouraged the production of geographical and historical writings by others. It was at Hakluyt's suggestion that Robert Parke translated Juan Gonzalez de Mendoza's The History of the Great and Mighty Kingdom of China and the Situation Thereof (1588–1590),An edition was published by the Hakluyt Society in the 19th century as [tpl]cite book|author=Juan Gonzalez de Mendoza (comp.)|coauthors=Robert Parke (trans.); G.T.

The Hakluyt Society was founded in 1846 for printing rare and unpublished accounts of voyages and travels, and continues to publish volumes each year.[tpl]cite web|title=History and Objectives of the Hakluyt Society|url=http://www.hakluyt.com/hak-soc-objectives.htm?PHPSESSID=9175b423002ab30923565934fa4e2dd7|publisher=Hakluyt Society|accessdate=13 July 2007[/tpl]
In May 2008, a major interdisciplinary conference called Richard Hakluyt 1552–1616: Life, Times, Legacy, examining the significance of Hakluyt's work, was jointly organized by the National Maritime Museum, the Centre for Travel Writing Studies, Nottingham Trent University and the National University of Ireland, Galway. A major aim of the conference was to lay the groundwork for and establish a network of scholars to prepare a new edition of Hakluyt's Principal Navigations. Those leading this group include Nigel Rigby, Will Ryan (President of the Hakluyt Society), and the project's editors Daniel Carey (NUI, Galway), Andrew Hadfield (University of Sussex) and Claire Jowitt (NTU).[tpl]Cite journal|title=The Richard Hakluyt 'Principal Navigations' editorial project|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/researchers/research-areas-and-projects/richard-hakluyt-conference|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xPAroLcH|archivedate=23 March 2011|publisher=National Maritime Museum|year=2008|accessdate=23 March 2011[/tpl]
