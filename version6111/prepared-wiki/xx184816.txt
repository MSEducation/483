Was the flagship show of now defunct XLEAGUE.TV, The Match was a studio based show which delivered highlights from  tournament and league play from XLEAGUE.TV's club and league competition. 
The bulk of the show's content was presented in the style of sports broadcasting found on television, with the two commentators at hand first taking presenting roles by introducing the game, competitors and rules of the contest from the commentary booth, before play begins. When the channel started, a series of pundits and a dedicated presenter would handle those duties, discuss the game and offer their opinion on the outcome; however, this was streamlined for all but League or Tournament finals, where it was felt the extra ceremony was more appreciated. 
One noticeable resemblance to televised sport was in its soccer/football style commentary and pundit formats, though coverage also offered replay clips and highlights. Where appropriate, specialist commentators are brought in to contribute their own experience, such as national broadcaster and sports journalist, Trevor Harris.
