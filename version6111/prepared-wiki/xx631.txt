Costa Rica ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Costa Rica.ogg|ˌ|k|oʊ|s|t|ə|_|ˈ|r|iː|k|ə[/tpl], meaning "rich coast" in Spanish), officially the Republic of Costa Rica ([tpl]lang-es|Costa Rica[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|es|República de Costa Rica[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-es|reˈpuβlika ðe ˈkosta ˈrika|pron[/tpl]), is a country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Caribbean Sea to the east.
Costa Rica was sparsely inhabited by indigenous people before it came under Spanish rule in the 16th century. Once a poor and isolated colony, since becoming independent in the 18th century, Costa Rica has become one of the most stable, prosperous, and progressive nations in Latin America. It constitutionally abolished its army permanently in 1949, becoming the first and one of the few sovereign nations without a standing army.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elespiritudel48.org/docu/h013.htm|author=El Espíritu del 48|title=Abolición del Ejército|accessdate=2008-03-09|language=Spanish[/tpl][tpl]cite web|accessdate=2009-06-09|url=http://dev.prenhall.com/divisions/hss/worldreference/CR/defense.html|title=Costa Rica|publisher=World Desk Reference[/tpl][tpl]cite web|accessdate=2009-06-09|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=39&regionSelect=4-Central_Americas|title=Costa Rica|publisher=Uppsala University[/tpl] A constitutional republic, it is the only Latin American country to have been a democracy since 1950 or earlier.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15501885&fsrc=rss|title=Costa Rica's new president: Thriller for Chinchilla|publisher=The Economist|date=2010-02-11|accessdate=2010-02-16[/tpl] Costa Rica has consistently been among the top-ranking Latin American countries in the Human Development Index (HDI), placing 62nd in the world as of 2012.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian period===

Historians have classified the indigenous people of Costa Rica as belonging to the Intermediate Area, where the peripheries of the Mesoamerican and Andean native cultures overlapped. More recently, pre-Columbian Costa Rica has also been described as part of the Isthmo-Colombian Area.
The oldest evidence of human occupation in Costa Rica is associated with the arrival of various groups of hunter-gatherers at about 10,000 to 7,000 years BCE, with ancient archaeological evidence (stone tool making) located in the Turrialba Valley. There was presence of Clovis culture type spearheads and arrows from South America, which opens the possibility that in this area two different cultures coexisted.[tpl]harvnb|Botey Sobrado|2002| p=30-31|sp=yes[/tpl]
Agriculture became evident in the populations that lived in Costa Rica about 5,000 years ago. They mainly grew tubers and roots (like carrots). For the first and second millennia BCE there were already settled farming communities. These were small and scattered, although the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture as the main livelihood in the territory is still unknown.[tpl]harvnb|Botey Sobrado|2002| p=32|sp=yes[/tpl]
The earliest use of pottery known appears around 2,000 to 3,000 BCE. Shards of pots, cylindrical vases, platters, gourds and other forms of vases decorated with grooves, prints, and some modeled after animals have been found.[tpl]harvnb|Botey Sobrado|2002| p=32-33|sp=sí[/tpl]
The impact of indigenous peoples on modern Costa Rican culture has been relatively small compared to other nations, since the country lacked a strong native civilization to begin with. Most of the native population was absorbed into the Spanish-speaking colonial society through inter-marriage, except for some small remnants, the most significant of which are the Bribri and Boruca tribes who still inhabit the mountains of the Cordillera de Talamanca, in the southern part of Costa Rica, near the frontier with Panama.

===Spanish colonization===

Accounts differ as to whether the name la costa rica (Spanish for "rich coast") was first applied by Christopher Columbus, who sailed to the eastern shores of Costa Rica during his final voyage in 1502,[tpl]cite web | title=About Costa Rica | work=Embassy of Costa Rica in Washington DC | url=http://www.costarica-embassy.org/index.php?q=node/19 | accessdate=2012-09-18 [/tpl] and reported the presence of vast quantities of gold jewelry among the natives[tpl]cite web | title=History of Costa Rica | work=Lonely Planet | url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/costa-rica/history | accessdate=2012-09-18 [/tpl] or by the conquistador Gil González Dávila, who landed on the west coast in 1522, met with the natives, and appropriated some of their gold.[tpl]cite book |year=2010 | page=42 |title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Costa Rica[/tpl]
During most of the colonial period, Costa Rica was the southernmost province of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, which was nominally part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (i.e., Mexico), but which, in practice, operated as a largely autonomous entity within the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica's distance from the capital in Guatemala, its legal prohibition under Spanish law to trade with its southern neighbors in Panama, then part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada (i.e., Colombia), and the lack of resources, such as gold and silver, made Costa Rica into a poor, isolated, and sparsely inhabited region within the Spanish Empire.[tpl]cite book | title= Claudia Quirós. La Era de la Encomienda. Historia de Costa Rica. Editorial de la Universidad de Costa Rica. 1990.[/tpl] Costa Rica was described as "the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America" by a Spanish governor in 1719.[tpl]cite book |author=Shafer, D. Michael |title=Winners and losers: how sectors shape the developmental prospects of states |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |year=1994|isbn=0-8014-8188-0[/tpl]
Another important factor behind Costa Rica's poverty was the lack of a significant indigenous population available for Encomienda (forced labor), which meant most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land, preventing the establishment of large haciendas (properties). For all these reasons, Costa Rica was, by and large, unappreciated and overlooked by the Spanish Crown and left to develop on its own. The circumstances during this period are believed to have led to many of the idiosyncrasies for which Costa Rica has become known, while concomitantly setting the stage for Costa Rica's development as a more egalitarian society than the rest of its neighbors. Costa Rica became a "rural democracy" with no oppressed mestizo or indigenous class. It was not long before Spanish settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a milder climate than that of the lowlands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.costarica.com/Destinations/Cities-and-Towns/Cartago/ |title=Costa Rica – Cartago |publisher=Costarica.com |date=2009-05-22 |accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl]

===Independence===

Like the rest of Central America, Costa Rica never fought for independence from Spain. On September 15, 1821, after the final Spanish defeat in the Mexican War of Independence (1810–21), the authorities in Guatemala declared the independence of all of Central America. That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in Costa Rica, even though, technically, under the Spanish Constitution of 1812 that had been readopted in 1820, Nicaragua and Costa Rica had become an autonomous province with its capital in León.
Like other Central American nations, Costa Rica joined the short-lived First Mexican Empire of Agustín de Iturbide but, after its collapse in 1823, Costa Rica became, instead, a province of the new Federal Republic of Central America, which theoretically existed from 1823 to 1839, but which exercised a very loose authority over its constituent provinces, particularly the poor and remote Costa Rica. In 1824, the Costa Rican capital was moved to San José, leading to a brief outburst of violence over rivalry with the old capital, Cartago. While civil wars raged both among the provinces of the Federal Republic of Central America and between political factions within individual provinces, Costa Rica remained largely at peace.
In 1838, long after the Federal Republic of Central America ceased to function in practice, Costa Rica formally withdrew and proclaimed itself sovereign. The considerable distance and poor communication routes between Guatemala City and the Central Plateau, where most of the Costa Rican population lived then and still lives now, meant the local population had little allegiance to the federal government in Guatemala. From colonial times to now, Costa Rica's reluctance to become politically tied with the rest of Central America has been a major obstacle to efforts for greater regional integration.

===Economic growth===

Coffee was first planted in Costa Rica in the early 19th century, and was first shipped to Europe in 1843, soon becoming Costa Rica's first major export. Coffee production would remain Costa Rica's principal source of wealth well into the 20th century. Most of the coffee exported was grown around the main centers of population in the Central Plateau and then transported by oxcart to the Pacific port of Puntarenas. Since the main market for the coffee was in Europe, it soon became a high priority to develop a transportation route from the Central Plateau to the Atlantic Ocean. For this purpose, in the 1870s, the Costa Rican government contracted with U.S. businessman Minor C. Keith to build a railroad to the Caribbean port of Limón. Despite enormous difficulties with construction, disease, and financing, the railroad was completed in 1890.
Most Afro-Costa Ricans, who constitute about 3% of the country's population, descend from Jamaican immigrants who worked in the construction of that railway.[tpl]cite news| title= Blacks of Costa Rica |url =http://www.everyculture.com/Middle-America-Caribbean/Blacks-of-Costa-Rica.html | work =World Culture Encyclopedia | accessdate = 2007-11-23[/tpl] United States convicts, Italians and Chinese immigrants also participated in the construction project. In exchange for completing the railroad, the Costa Rican government granted Keith large tracts of land and a lease on the train route, which he used to produce bananas and export them to the United States. As a result, bananas came to rival coffee as the principal Costa Rican export, while foreign-owned corporations (including the United Fruit Company) began to hold a major role in the national economy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]

====20th century====

Historically, Costa Rica has generally enjoyed greater peace and more consistent political stability compared with many of its fellow Latin American nations. Since the late 19th century, however, Costa Rica has experienced two significant periods of violence. In 1917–19, General Federico Tinoco Granados ruled as a military dictator until he was overthrown and forced into exile. The unpopularity of Tinoco's regime led, after he was overthrown, to a considerable decline in the size, wealth, and political influence of the Costa Rican military. In 1948, José Figueres Ferrer led an armed uprising in the wake of a disputed presidential election between the previous president Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia (he served as president between 1940 and 1944) and Otilio Ulate Blanco.See Ian Holzhauer, "The Presidency of Calderón Guardia" (University of Florida History Thesis, 2004) With more than 2,000 dead, the resulting 44-day Costa Rican Civil War was the bloodiest event in Costa Rica during the 20th century.
The victorious rebels formed a government junta that abolished the military altogether, and oversaw the drafting of a new constitution by a democratically elected assembly."The Happiest People". The New York Times. January 6, 2010. Having enacted these reforms, the junta relinquished its power on November 8, 1949, to the new democratic government. After the coup d'état, Figueres became a national hero, winning the country's first democratic election under the new constitution in 1953. Since then, Costa Rica has held 14 presidential elections, the latest in 2014. All of them have been widely regarded by the international community as peaceful and transparent. [tpl]citation needed|date=May 2014[/tpl] With uninterrupted democracy dating back to at least 1948, the country is the most stable in the region.

==Geography==

Costa Rica is located on the Central American isthmus, lying between latitudes 8° and 12°N, and longitudes 82° and 86°W. It borders the Caribbean Sea (to the east) and the Pacific Ocean (to the west), with a total of [tpl]convert|1290|km|mi[/tpl] of coastline, [tpl]convert|212|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] on the Caribbean coast and [tpl]convert|1016|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] on the Pacific.
Costa Rica also borders Nicaragua to the north ([tpl]convert|309|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl] of border) and Panama to the south-southeast ([tpl]convert|330|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl] of border). In total, Costa Rica comprises [tpl]convert|51100|km2|sqmi[/tpl] plus [tpl]convert|589|km2|sqmi[/tpl] of territorial waters.
The highest point in the country is Cerro Chirripó, at [tpl]convert|3819|m|ft[/tpl]; it is the fifth highest peak in Central America. The highest volcano in the country is the Irazú Volcano ([tpl]convert|3431|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) and the largest lake is Lake Arenal.
Costa Rica also comprises several islands. Cocos Island ([tpl]convert|24|km2|sqmi|disp=or[/tpl]) stands out because of its distance from the continental landmass, [tpl]convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from Puntarenas, but Calero Island is the largest island of the country ([tpl]convert|151.6|km2|sqmi|disp=or[/tpl]). Over 25% of Costa Rica's national territory is protected by SINAC (the National System of Conservation Areas), which oversees all of the country's protected areas. Costa Rica also possesses the greatest density of species in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inbio.ac.cr/es/biod/estrategia/estudio.html |title=estudiofi |publisher=Inbio.ac.cr |accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl]

===Climate===

Because Costa Rica is located between 8 and 12 degrees north of the Equator, the climate is tropical year round. However, the country has many microclimates depending on elevation, rainfall, topography, and by the geography of each particular region.
Costa Rica's seasons are defined by how much rain falls during a particular period. The year can be split into two periods, the dry season known to the residents as summer, and the rainy season, known locally as winter. The "summer" or dry season goes from December to April, and "winter" or rainy season goes from May to November, which almost coincides with the Atlantic hurricane season, and during this time, it rains constantly in some regions.
The location receiving the most rain is the Caribbean slopes of the Central Cordillera mountains, with an annual rainfall of over [tpl]convert|5000|mm|1|abbr=on[/tpl]. Humidity is also higher on the Caribbean side than on the Pacific side. The mean annual temperature on the coastal lowlands is around [tpl]convert|27|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl], [tpl]convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in the main populated areas of the Central Cordilera, and below [tpl]convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] on the summits of the highest mountains.[tpl]cite web|last=Eggar|first=Marc|title=Climate/Weather|url=http://www.worldheadquarters.com/cr/climate/|accessdate=28 June 2011[/tpl]

Tortuguero National Park – the name Tortuguero can be translated as "Full of Turtles" – is home to spider, howler and white-throated capuchin monkeys; the three-toed sloth and two-toed sloth; 320 species of birds; and a variety of reptiles. The park is recognized for the annual nesting of the endangered green turtle, and is the most important nesting site for the species.

Over 400 types of birds and more than 100 species of mammals can be found there.
Over 840 species of birds have been identified in Costa Rica. As is the case in much of Central America, the avian species in Costa Rica are a mix of North and South American species. The country's abundant fruit trees, many of which bear fruit year round, are hugely important to the birds, some of whom survive on diets that consist only of one or two types of fruit. Some of the country's most notable avian species include the Resplendent Quetzal, Scarlet Macaw, Three-wattled Bellbird, Bare-necked Umbrellabird, and the Keel-billed Toucan.[tpl]cite web|last=Stater|first=Adam|title=Birds of Costa Rica|url=http://www.anywherecostarica.com/flora-fauna/bird[/tpl] The Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad is allowed to collect royalties on any biological discoveries of medical importance.

==Economy==

According to the World Bank, Costa Rica's GDP per capita is US$12,874 PPP (as of 2013); however, this developing country still faces lack of maintenance and new investment in infrastructure, a poverty rate estimated to be 23%,Human development indices 2008. undp.org a 7.8% unemployment rate (2012 est.), and a trade deficit of 5.2%. For the fiscal year 2007, the country showed a government surplus. Economic growth in 2008 diminished to a 3% increase in the face of a global recession (down from 7% and 9% growth in the prior two years).[tpl]cite news| title=Costa Rica: Economy |url =http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2019.htm | work =U.S. State Department |accessdate = 2007-11-02[/tpl]
Costa Rica's inflation rate was an estimated 4.5% in 2012. On October 16, 2006, a new currency exchange system was introduced, allowing the value of the CRC colón to float between two bands as done previously by Chile. This policy's objective was to allow the Central Bank to be able to better tackle inflation and discourage the use of U.S. dollars. However, as of August 2009, the value of the colón against the dollar has decreased to 86% of its late-2006 value (see commonly available forex trading charts). The unit of currency is the colón, and as of April 2014, it trades around 550 to the US$,[tpl]cite web|url=http://indicadoreseconomicos.bccr.fi.cr/indicadoreseconomicos/Cuadros/frmVerCatCuadro.aspx?idioma=1&CodCuadro=%20400 |title=Tipo cambio de compra y de venta del dĂłlar de los Estados Unidos de AmĂŠrica |publisher=Indicadoreseconomicos.bccr.fi.cr |accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl] and about 760 colones to the euro.
The central government offers tax exemptions for those willing to invest in the country.

In 1996, the Forest Law was enacted to provide direct financial incentives to landowners for the provision of environmental services. This helped reorient the forestry sector away from commercial timber production and the resulting deforestation, and helped create awareness of the services it provides for the economy and society (i.e. carbon fixation, hydrological services such as producing fresh drinking water, biodiversity protection, and provision of scenic beauty).

==Governance==

===Provinces, cantons, and districts===

Costa Rica is composed of seven provinces, which in turn are divided into 81 cantons ([tpl]lang-es|link=no|cantón[/tpl], plural [tpl]lang|es|cantones[/tpl]), each of which is directed by a mayor. Mayors are chosen democratically every four years by each canton's people. There are no provincial legislatures. The cantons are further divided into 473 districts ([tpl]lang|es|distritos[/tpl]).

===Foreign relations===

Costa Rica is an active member of the United Nations and the Organization of American States. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the United Nations University of Peace are based in Costa Rica. It is also a member of many other international organizations related to human rights and democracy.
A main foreign policy objective of Costa Rica is to foster human rights and sustainable development as a way to secure stability and growth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rree.go.cr/?sec=ministerio&cat=politica%20exterior |title=Costa Rican Ministry of International Relations Declaration of Objectives |publisher=Costa Rican Ministry of International relations |accessdate=2011-04-23[/tpl]

On September 10, 1961, some months after Fidel Castro declared Cuba a socialist state, Costa Rican President Mario Echandi ended diplomatic relations with Cuba through Executive Decree Number 2. This freeze lasted for 47 years until President Óscar Arias Sánchez announced on 18 March 2009 that normal relations were to be re-established, saying, "If we have been able to turn the page with regimes as profoundly different to our reality as occurred with the USSR or, more recently, with the Republic of China, how would we not do it with a country that is geographically and culturally much nearer to Costa Rica?" Arias also announced both countries would exchange ambassadors.Costa Rica re-establishes ties with Cuba CNN World, 2009-03-18.

An 1858 treaty extended navigation rights to Costa Rica, but Nicaragua denied passenger travel and fishing were part of the deal; the court ruled Costa Ricans on the river were not required to have Nicaraguan tourist cards or visas as Nicaragua alleged, but, in a nod to the Nicaraguans, ruled Costa Rican boats and passengers must stop at the first and last Nicaraguan port along their route. They must also have an identity document or passport. Nicaragua can also impose timetables on Costa Rican traffic.

==Demographics==

The 2011 census counted a population of 4,301,712 people. Whites, castizos and mestizos 83.63%, while 1.05% are Black, or Afro-Caribbean, 6.12% Mulattoes, 2.4% Native American, 0.2% Chinese, and 6.6% other.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] An average Costa Rican from the Central Valley has an 67.5% European, 29.3% Amerindian and 3.2% African ancestry.[tpl]cite journal|title=Geographic Patterns of Genome Admixture in Latin American Mestizos|accessdate=31 January 2013|at=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2265669/bin/pgen.1000037.s006.xls|pmc=2265669[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000037|title=Geographic Patterns of Genome Admixture in Latin American Mestizos|year=2008|last1=Wang|first1=Sijia|last2=Ray|first2=Nicolas|last3=Rojas|first3=Winston|last4=Parra|first4=Maria V.|last5=Bedoya|first5=Gabriel|last6=Gallo|first6=Carla|last7=Poletti|first7=Giovanni|last8=Mazzotti|first8=Guido|last9=Hill|first9=Kim|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=4|issue=3|pages=e1000037|pmid=18369456|pmc=2265669|editor1-last=McVean|editor1-first=Gil[/tpl]
There are also over 104,000 Native American or indigenous inhabitants, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: Quitirrisí (in the Central Valley), Matambú or Chorotega (Guanacaste), Maleku (northern Alajuela), Bribri (southern Atlantic), Cabécar (Cordillera de Talamanca), Guaymí (southern Costa Rica, along the Panamá border), Boruca (southern Costa Rica) and Térraba (southern Costa Rica).
The population of European ancestry is primarily of Spanish descent, with significant numbers of Italian, German, English, Dutch, French, Irish, Portuguese, Lebanese, Moroccan, Syrian and Polish families, as well a sizable Jewish community. The majority of the Afro-Costa Ricans are Creole English-speaking descendants of 19th century black Jamaican immigrant workers.
The 2011 census classified 83.63% of the population as white, castizo or mestizo. Mulattoes (mix of white and black) represent now 6.12% of the total population, 2.4% as Amerindian, 2% as Black and less than 1% as Asian. Native and European mixed blood populations are far less than in other Latin American countries. Exceptions are Guanacaste, where almost half the population is visibly mestizo, a legacy of the more pervasive unions between Spanish colonists and Chorotega Amerindians through several generations, and Limón, where the vast majority of the Afro-Costa Rican community lives.

===Religion===

Christianity is the predominant religion, and Roman Catholicism is the official state religion according to the 1949 Constitution, which at the same time guarantees freedom of religion.
According to the most recent nationwide survey of religion, conducted in 2007 by the University of Costa Rica, 70.5% of Costa Ricans are Roman Catholics  (44.9% practicing Catholics), 13.8% are evangelical Protestants, 11.3% report that they do not have a religion, and 4.3% belong to another religion.
Because of the recent small, but continuous, immigration from Asia and the Middle East, other religions have grown, the most popular being Buddhism with about 100,000  practitioners (over 2% of the population) due to a growing Han Chinese community of 40,000 and new local converts). There  are also smaller numbers of Hindu, Jewish, Bahá’í, and Muslim adherents.

===Languages===

The primary language spoken in Costa Rica is Costa Rican Spanish. Some native languages are still spoken in indigenous reservations. The most numerically important are the Bribri, Maléku, Cabécar and Ngäbere languages, some of which have several thousand speakers in Costa Rica – others a few hundred. Some languages, such as Teribe and Boruca, have fewer than a thousand speakers. A Creole-English language, Jamaican patois (also known as Mekatelyu), is spoken along the Caribbean coast. About 10.7% of Costa Rica's adult population (18 or older) also speaks English, 0.7% French, and 0.3% speaks Portuguese or German as a second language.[tpl]cite news|url=http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/marzo/11/pais1457622.html|title=Solo 1 de cada 10 adultos habla un segundo idioma|publisher=La Nación (Costa Rica)|author=Jairo Villegas|date=2008-03-13|accessdate=2010-07-22[/tpl]

==Culture==

Costa Rica was the point where the Mesoamerican and South American native cultures met. The northwest of the country, the Nicoya peninsula, was the southernmost point of Nahuatl cultural influence when the Spanish conquerors (conquistadores) came in the 16th century. The central and southern portions of the country had Chibcha influences. The Atlantic coast, meanwhile, was populated with African workers during the 17th and 18th centuries.
Costa Rican cuisine is a blend of Native American, Spanish, African and many other cuisine origins. Dishes such as the very traditional tamale and many others made of corn are the most representative of its indigenous inhabitants, and similar to other neighboring Mesoamerican countries. Spaniards brought many new ingredients to the country from other lands, especially spices and domestic animals. And later in the 19th century, the African flavor lent its presence with influence from other Caribbean mixed flavors. This is how Costa Rican cuisine today is very varied, with every new ethnic group who had recently become part of the country's population influencing the country's cuisine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southerncostarica.biz/General/cat-others/Costarican-Typical-Food/179/ |title=Costa Rican Typical Food |publisher=Southerncostarica.biz |accessdate=2011-11-02[/tpl][tpl]Verify credibility|date=February 2011[/tpl]
As a result of the immigration of Spaniards, their 16th-century Spanish culture and its evolution marked everyday life and culture until today, with Spanish language and the Catholic religion as primary influences.
The Department of Culture, Youth, and Sports is in charge of the promotion and coordination of cultural life. The work of the department is divided into Direction of Culture, Visual Arts, Scenic Arts, Music, Patrimony and the System of Libraries. Permanent programs, such as the National Symphony Orchestra of Costa Rica and the Youth Symphony Orchestra, are conjunctions of two areas of work: Culture and Youth.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]
Dance-oriented genres, such as soca, salsa, bachata, merengue, cumbia and Costa Rican swing are enjoyed increasingly by older rather than younger people. The guitar is popular, especially as an accompaniment to folk dances; however, the marimba was made the national instrument.
"Pura Vida" is the most recognizable phrase attached to Costa Ricans, and it reflects the Costa Rican way of life. Often, people walking down the streets, or buying food at shops say hello by saying "Pura Vida", which means pure life, or good life. It can be phrased as a question or as an acknowledgement of one's presence. A recommended response to "How are you?" would be "Pura Vida".[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]

Universal public education is guaranteed in the constitution. Primary education is obligatory, and both preschool and high school are free. There are only a few schools in Costa Rica that go beyond the 12th grade. Students who finish 11th grade receive a Costa Rican Bachillerato Diploma accredited by the Costa Rican Ministry of Education.
There are both state and private universities, with the public universities being regarded as the best in the country, as well as being one of the best means of social mobility, given the large proportion of the budget spent to subsidize students from poor families.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2014[/tpl] The University of Costa Rica has been awarded the title "Meritorious Institution of Costa Rican Education and Culture".

Costa Rica has been cited in various journals as Central America's great health success story.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] Its healthcare system is ranked higher than that of the United States, despite having a fraction of its GDP.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Jacob |first1=Brian | year=2009 |title=CLOSING THE GAPS: The Challenge to Protect Costa Rica's Health Care System |journal=The Georgetown Public Policy Review |issue= 77|url= https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=15+Geo.+Public+Pol%27y+Rev.+77&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=c9ac6e737b89580642db61a5300fe8fc[/tpl] Prior to 1940, government hospitals and charities provided most health care delivery. But since the 1941 creation of the Social Insurance Administration (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social – CCSS), Costa Rica has provided universal health care to its wage-earning residents, with coverage extended to dependants over time. In 1973, the CCSS took over administration of all 29 of the country's public hospitals and all health care, also launching a Rural Health Program (Programa de Salud Rural) for primary care to rural areas, later extended to primary care services nationwide. In 1993, laws were passed to enable elected health boards that represented health consumers, social insurance representatives, employers, and social organizations. By the year 2000, social health insurance coverage was available to 82% of the Costa Rican population. Each health committee manages an area equivalent to one of the 83 administrative cantons of Costa Rica. There is limited use of private, for-profit services (around 14.4% of the national total health expenditure). About 7% of GDP is allocated to the health sector, and over 70% is government funded.
Primary health care facilities in Costa Rica include health clinics, with a general practitioner, nurse, clerk, pharmacist and a primary health technician. In 2008, there were five specialty national hospitals, three general national hospitals, seven regional hospitals, 13 peripheral hospitals, and 10 major clinics serving as referral centers for primary care clinics, which also deliver biopsychosocial services, family and community medical services and promotion and prevention programs. Patients can choose private health care to avoid waiting lists.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
