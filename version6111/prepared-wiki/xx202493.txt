The Philadelphia Eagles, a professional American football team based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, joined the National Football League (NFL) in 1933 as a replacement team for the Frankford Yellow Jackets, after the Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and ceased operations.[tpl]cite web | work=PhiladelphiaEagles.com | url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20081204021359/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/team/alltimehistory.asp | title=Philadelphia Eagles History | accessdate=2008-05-26[/tpl] After the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, the Eagles were moved to the current NFC East division. Every April, each NFL franchise adds new players to its roster through a collegiate draft at the "NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting", more commonly known as the NFL Draft.[tpl]cite news|last=Branch |first=John |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20000409/ai_n9969057 |title=The 2000 Liars Club/ Draft makes Broncos coach cloak intentions |publisher=findarticles.com |work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date= 2000-04-09| accessdate=2008-05-29[/tpl]  Teams are ranked in inverse order based on their previous season's records, with the worst record picking first, the second-worst picking second, and so on. Two exceptions to this order are made for teams that played in the previous Super Bowl: the Super Bowl champion picks last (32nd), and the Super Bowl loser picks next to last (31st).  Teams often trade their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or combinations thereof; thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from its assigned pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round.[tpl]cite web|url=http://football.about.com/od/miscinformation/a/detdraftorder.htm| last = Alder | first = James | title = "NFL Draft Basics:Determining Order of Selection" | work = About.com | accessdate=2008-05-26[/tpl]
