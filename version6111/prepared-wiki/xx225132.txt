[[Robbery Beaches]]

CATEGORIES: Beaches of Livingston Island

Robbery Beaches are beaches extending along the north side of Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica between Essex Point to the west and Nedelya Point to the east.
The name ‘Robbery Beach’ was used by James Weddell in 1820-23.  It arose from the English robbery of sealskins collected by the American brig Charity (Capt. Charles H. Barnard) of New York in January 1821.  There was fierce competition between British and American sealers in the area during the early 1820s.
