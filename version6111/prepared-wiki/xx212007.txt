==Historic development==

Guevara is first attested in Roman times as lying in the territory of the Varduli, thought to be probably Celts according to ongoing discussion. The name appears as "Gebala", linguistically related to cognate Gothic "gibla" or Greek "kephale", 'head, prominence'. However, no archaeological findings related to that period have been unearthed to date.
Records are mute during the early Middle Ages, but we hear of Guevara again in the 11th century in a document referred to the counts of Oñati (Oñate). The place is renowned for the role played by the lords of Guevara in the bloody Basque Party Wars of the late Middle Ages and their castle conspicuous from miles away at the top of a hill.

The Brotherhood of Guevara (Hermandad de Guevara) formerly administered the village of Guevara, as well as Elguea, Etura and Urízar, but after the municipal reforms of the 19th century, the Brotherhood was converted into a municipality.  In 1885, the municipality was integrated into that of Barrundia.
