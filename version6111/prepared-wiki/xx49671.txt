[[Vibrio]]

CATEGORIES: Vibrionales

Vibrio is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria possessing a curved rod shape (comma shape), several species of which can cause foodborne infection, usually associated with eating undercooked seafood.  Typically found in saltwater, Vibrio spp. are facultative anaerobes that test positive for oxidase and do not form spores.  All members of the genus are motile and have polar flagella with sheaths.  Recent phylogenies have been constructed based on a suite of genes (multilocus sequence analysis).[tpl]Cite journal |title =Phylogeny and Molecular Identification of Vibrios on the Basis of Multilocus Sequence Analysis[/tpl]
The name Vibrio derives from Filippo Pacini who isolated microorganisms he called "vibrions" from cholera patients in 1854, because of their motility.

==Pathogenic strains==

Several species of Vibrio are pathogens.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. Bacteria. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds. Sidney Draggan and C.J.Cleveland, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC Most disease-causing strains are associated with gastroenteritis, but can also infect open wounds and cause septicemia. It can be carried by numerous sea-living animals, such as crabs or prawns, and has been known to cause fatal infections in humans during exposure. Pathogenic Vibrio include V. cholerae (the causative agent of cholera), V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus.  Vibrio cholerae is generally transmitted via contaminated water.  Pathogenic Vibrio can cause foodborne illness (infection), usually associated with eating undercooked seafood.
Vibrio vulnificus outbreaks commonly occur in warm climates and small, generally lethal, outbreaks occur regularly.  An outbreak occurred in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and several lethal cases occur most years in Florida. As of 2013 in the United States, vibrio infections as a whole were up 43 percent when compared with the rates observed in 2006-2008. Vibrio vulnificus, the most severe strain, has not increased. Foodborne vibrio infections are most often associated with eating raw shellfish.[tpl]cite news|title=Infections from some foodborne germs increased, while others remained unchanged in 2012|url=http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0418-foodborne-germs.html|accessdate=April 19, 2013|newspaper=Centers for Disease Control|date=April 18, 2013[/tpl]
V. parahaemolyticus is also associated with the Kanagawa phenomenon, in which strains isolated from human hosts (clinical isolates) are hemolytic on blood agar plates, while those isolated from nonhuman sources are nonhemolytic.
Many Vibrio spp. are also zoonotic.  They cause disease in fish and shellfish, and are common causes of mortality among domestic marine life.

==Treatment==

Medical care depends on the clinical presentation and the presence of underlying medical conditions.

===Vibrio gastroenteritis (caused by Vibrio parahaemolyticus)===

Because Vibrio gastroenteritis is self-limited in most patients, no specific medical therapy is required. Patients who cannot tolerate oral fluid replacement may require intravenous fluid therapy.
Although most Vibrio species are sensitive to antibiotics such as doxycycline or quinolones, antibiotic therapy does not shorten the course of the illness or the duration of pathogen excretion. However, if the patient is ill and has a high fever or an underlying medical condition, oral antibiotic therapy with doxycycline or quinolone can be initiated.

===Non-cholera Vibrio infections===

Patients with noncholera Vibrio wound infection or septicemia are much more ill and frequently have other medical conditions. Medical therapy consists of the following:

==Other strains==

Vibrio fischeri, Photobacterium phosphoreum, and Vibrio harveyi are notable for their ability to communicate. Both V. fischeri and Ph. phosphoreum are symbiotes of other marine organisms (typically jellyfish, fish, or squid), and produce light via bioluminescence through the mechanism of quorum sensing. V. harveyi is a pathogen of several aquatic animals, and is notable as a cause of luminous vibriosis in shrimps (prawns)[tpl]Cite journal | author=Austin B & Zhang X-H |title=Vibrio harveyi: a significant pathogen of marine vertebrates and invertebrates |journal=Letters in Applied Microbiology |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=119â€“214 |year=2006 |doi=10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.01989.x | pmid=16869892[/tpl]

==Flagella==

The "typical", early-discovered Vibrio, such as V. cholerae, have a single polar flagellum (monotrichous) with sheath. Some species, such as V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus, have both a single polar flagellum with sheath and thin flagella projecting in all directions (peritrichous), and the other species, such as V. fischeri, have tufts of polar flagella with sheath (lophotrichous).
