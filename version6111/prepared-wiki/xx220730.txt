Spanair Flight 5022 (JK5022) was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Madrid-Barajas Airport to Gran Canaria Airport, Spain that crashed just after take off from runway 36L of Barajas Airport at 14:24 CEST (12:24 UTC) on 20 August 2008.  The aircraft was a McDonnell Douglas MD-82, registration EC-HFP. 154 people died; six died en route to the hospital, one died overnight and one died in the hospital three days later.  Only 18 people survived.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7579293.stm |title=Madrid crash claims another life |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=25 August 2008 |date=23 August 2008[/tpl]
It was the first and only fatal accident for Spanair (part of the SAS Group) in the 22-year history of the company, and the 14th fatal accident and 24th hull loss involving MD-80 series aircraft. The accident was the first fatal accident of any aeroplane featuring a full airline alliance special aircraft livery.  It was the world's deadliest aviation accident in 2008 and Spain's deadliest since the 1983 crash of Avianca Flight 011.[tpl]cite web |last=Santafe |first=Elisa |title=Families struggle to face up to losses in Spain air disaster |publisher=Brisbane Times |date=22 August 2006 |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/world/families-struggle-to-face-up-to-losses-in-spain-air-disaster/2008/08/22/1219262462353.html |accessdate=22 August 2008[/tpl]

At lower speeds, such as those associated with take-offs and landings (typically 160mph), the lift generated by the wings is much less than at cruise speed - or would be were it not for the use of high-lift devices such as flaps and slats. For low-speed flight, the pilot alters the shape of the wing by deploying the flaps and slats. For take-off, this is done during the pre-take off checks before entering the runway: in the MD-82, flaps and slats are controlled by a single lever on the cockpit's central console. The flaps are located at the trailing edge of the wings and, when deployed, extend backward and downward from the wing. The slats extend forward from the leading edge of the wing.CIAIAC final report, section 1.6.2.1, pages 17-23 (PDF pages 37-43 of 284) The effect of both flaps and slats is to increase the surface area and camber of the wing, thereby increasing the amount of lift produced.

==Investigation==

===Summary===

The accident was investigated by the Civil Aviation Accident and Incident Investigation Commission (CIAIAC). Representatives from the US National Transportation Safety Board, the aircraft manufacturer Boeing (as successor to McDonnell Douglas, the original aircraft manufacturer), and the engine manufacturer Pratt and Whitney supported the investigation.CIAIAC final report, Synopsis, (page xvii, PDF page 19 of 284)
A preliminary report on the accident was released by CIAIAC on 6 October 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fomento.es/NR/rdonlyres/C58972BC-B96C-4E14-B047-71B89DD0173E/43303/PreliminaryReportA_032_2008.pdf |title=20-08-2008. EC-HFP. McDonnell Douglas MD-82. Aeropuerto de Barajas (Madrid). Preliminary report |publisher=CIAIAC |date=14 October 2008[/tpl] (Spanish version) Flight data recorders showed that the aircraft had taken off with flaps at 0°, and that the alarm for that abnormal takeoff configuration had not sounded. The report hinted at no other cause of the accident. Both the engines and thrust reversers were excluded as causes of the accident.
On 17 August 2009, CIAIAC released an interim report on the incident.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fomento.es/NR/rdonlyres/9AA08FE0-1151-41A0-9A57-9C5DF8BF6F8E/52877/2008_032_A_INTERINO_01_ENG1.pdf |title=20-08-2008. EC-HFP. McDonnell Douglas MD-82. Aeropuerto de Barajas (Madrid). Interim report |publisher=CIAIAC |date=17 August 2009[/tpl] (Spanish version; press release)  The interim report confirmed the preliminary report's conclusion that the crash was caused by an attempt to take off with the flaps and slats retracted, which constituted an improper configuration, and noted that safeguards that should have prevented the crash failed to do so. The cockpit recordings revealed that the pilots omitted the "set and check the flap/slat lever and lights" item in the After Start checklist. In the Takeoff Imminent verification checklist the copilot just repeats the flaps and slats correct values without actually checking them, as shown by the physical evidence. All three safety barriers provided to avoid the takeoff in an inappropriate configuration were defeated: the configuration checklist, the confirm and verify checklist, and Take-off Warning System (TOWS). The report also made a number of safety recommendations intended to prevent incidents like this from happening again.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/informe/tragedia/Spanair/revela/errores/pilotos/fallo/tecnico/elpepuesp/20090817elpepunac_3/Tes |title=El informe de la tragedia de Spanair revela dos errores de los pilotos y un fallo técnico (Spanish) |publisher=El País |date=17 August 2009[/tpl]
CIAIAC published a further progress note in August 2010,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fomento.es/NR/rdonlyres/0C2AC4C7-8183-42D6-9CB9-AFDF6EBA71C3/76745/2008_032_A_PROGRESO_ENG1.pdf|title=Progress Note A-032/2008|publisher=CIAIAC[/tpl] (Spanish version) and its final report in July  2011.

===Theories===

====Fire or explosion====

Some early eye-witness accounts suggested that the aircraft suffered an engine fire or explosion before crashing, but the Spanish airport authority AENA released a video showing that the engines neither exploded nor caught fire during take-off.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/22/madrid.spain1?gusrc=rss&feed=networkfront|title=Madrid air disaster video shows new light on cause of crash|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=22 August 2008  | first=Graham | last=Keeley | date=22 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/08/22/plane.crash.madrid/index.html |title=Madrid plane burst into flames after runway skid |publisher=CNN |accessdate=24 August 2008 | date=22 August 2008[/tpl] Manuel Bautista, Director General of Spain's civil aviation authority, went as far as to state: "The engine is not the cause of the accident", surmising that a chain of events combining together was more likely than a single cause.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7577536.stm|title='Chain of faults' in Madrid crash|publisher=BBC |accessdate=22 August 2008 | date=22 August 2008[/tpl]

====Temperature sensor====

There has been considerable interest in the faulty air temperature probe (the total air temperature sensor,The aircraft's computer uses total air temperature to help calculate the ambient air temperature, which in turn is needed to calculate the aircraft's true airspeed. True airspeed is needed for high altitude navigation, but is not so important for maintaining stable flight. Ground Speed is calculated directly from GPS position change (or Inertial navigation position change on earlier models). When TAS (true airspeed) is compared with Groundspeed, however, the actual wind direction and speed at that altitude can be calculated and presented to the pilot. Indicated airspeed, a measure of the relative wind over the aircraft's surfaces, is a more important measure for ensuring stable, safe flight. The aircraft's stall speed closely relates to indicated airspeed, for example. located on the front of the aircraft near the cockpit) that initially caused the pilot to turn the plane back for maintenance before its catastrophic takeoff attempt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/SENS08218.xml&headline=Spanair%20Stands%20By%20MD-80%20Fleet&channel=comm|title=Spanair Stands by MD-80 Fleet|last=Flottau|first=Jens|date=21 August 2008|publisher=Aviation Week|accessdate=23 August 2008[/tpl] The maintenance logbook shows that overheating of the air temperature sensor occurred repeatedly the day before the crash.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] The mechanic simply deactivated the probe because the aircraft's Minimum Equipment List allowed it to be left inoperative. On 22 August investigators interviewed the mechanic, who defended his action by saying that it had nothing to do with the crash. Spanair has supported the mechanic's view that deactivation of the probe is an accepted procedure.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.qenshrin.com/en/details.php?id=1465|title=Spanish mechanic who cleared doomed plane quizzed|date=23 August 2008|agency=Associated Press  |accessdate=2011-12-31[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] On 1 September a report, quoting Spanair, stated that the problem detected on the first takeoff attempt was overheating caused by a temperature gauge's de-icing system, rather than a dysfunction of the temperature gauge itself and that since icing was not a risk on that flight, that the de-icing system had been deactivated by the mechanic with captain's approval.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20080901-speculation-over-causes-spanair-crash-spain-plane-crash-madrid|title=Speculation over causes of Spanair crash|publisher=France 24|date=1 September 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
On 11 May 2010, details from the cockpit voice recorder were leaked to the public and released by Spanish media. The recording showed that both pilots were concerned about a repair job performed earlier the day of the crash, in which mechanics used an ice pack to cool an overheating temperature sensor and removed a fuse.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/7710689/Last-moments-of-doomed-Spanair-flight-caught-on-tape.html|title=Last moments of doomed Spanair flight caught on tape|publisher=The Telegraph|date=11 May 2010|accessdate=24 August 2010|location=London|first=Fiona|last=Govan[/tpl] The BBC reported that the judge investigating the crash was to question three mechanics on suspicion of manslaughter. These were the two mechanics who checked the plane before take-off and the head of maintenance for Spanair at Barajas.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7673316.stm|title=Spanair mechanics face crash quizz|publisher=BBC  |date=16 October 2008 | accessdate=4 January 2010[/tpl]

====Thrust reverser====

One theory was that the thrust reverser of the No. 2 (right side) engine activated during the climb [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl], similar to Lauda Air Flight 004 in 1991, since one of the thrust reversers was seen to be in the deployed position in the wreckage. The investigation concluded that the position of the thrust reverser was a result of the accident, not a cause of it.Final report, section 1.12.7 "Wreckage and impact information: Engines If the reverser deployed during takeoff, and not as a result of impact, it has been suggested that the plane would have yawed suddenly to the right.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/perdida/potencia/motores/centra/pesquisas/elpepuesp/20080825elpepinac_1/Tes|title=La pérdida de potencia de los motores centra las pesquisas|last=Hernández|first=José Antonio|date=25 August 2008|publisher=El País|accessdate=25 August 2008[/tpl] Aircraft engineer Alberto Garcia dismissed this suggestion, pointing out that the MD-82 has tail-mounted engines positioned close to each other, and close to the plane's longitudinal axis, so that any yaw from asymmetric thrust would be small.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/08/26/espana/1219735081.html|title=Los motores están enteros y sin signos de haber sufrido incendio, según la investigación|date=26 August 2008|publisher=ElMundo.es|accessdate=26 August 2008[/tpl] Thrust reversers are normally employed just after touch down to reduce braking distances.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,574389,00.html|title=Triebwerk im Spanair-Jet war auf Umkehrschub geschaltet|date=26 August 2008|work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=26 August 2008[/tpl] Examination of the aircraft's maintenance logs showed that the thrust reverser on the right-side engine had been deactivated pending repair. It had been wired shut, and tape placed over the cockpit control to alert the crew. The MD-82 is permitted to fly with just one operable thrust reverser.Final report, section 1.12.7 "Wreckage and impact information: Engines[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/2639738/Spanish-crash-plane-had-known-mechanical-problem.html|title=Spanish crash plane had known mechanical problem|work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=29 August 2008  | first=Fiona | last=Govan | date=28 August 2008[/tpl]

====Flaps and slats====

El Mundo, citing a source in the investigation team,[tpl]who|date=November 2011[/tpl] reported that the cockpit voice recorder showed that the pilot had said "Flaps OK, Slats OK" to the co-pilot.[tpl]cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jmQhcrEox6otkY5j8VwtfDn7FoYg|title=Los alerones del avión estrellado en Madrid no estaban activados (prensa)|agency=AFP  |accessdate=6 September 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] The article confirmed that the flaps had not been extended and that the alarm for that condition had not sounded.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4685414.ece|title=Basic pilot error blamed for Spanair crash in Madrid that killed 154|work=The Times |location=UK |date=6 September 2008  | first=Charles | last=Bremner | accessdate=23 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] The final report concluded that the failure to deploy flaps was the cause of the accident. The pilots stated they checked the flaps while reviewing the pre-flight checklist,[tpl]Dubious|date=August 2011[/tpl] but did not actually test them. The warning signal that the flaps were not set failed to sound for unknown reasons.
The maintenance logbook of the airplane has comments, 2 days before the crash, for an "autoslats failure" visual alarm occurring on slats extension; however autoslats are not used on takeoff, and it can not be inferred that the slats system had a defect.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_18006.shtml|title=More faults revealed about fated Spanair plane|publisher=Typically Spanish|date=15 September 2008[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]

====Flight mode====

In an article published on 7 September, El Mundo stated that during the flight preparation and takeoff attempts, the aircraft had some of its systems in flight mode rather than ground mode. If true, this might explain why de-icing of the Total Air Temperature probe activated on the ground, causing overheat, since in flight the heater would activate only when there was no air flow in the probe, a sign of icing. This might also explain why the flaps and slats alarm had not sounded, since this alarm is disabled in flight mode.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/09/06/espana/1220724555.html|title=Las claves de la investigación del accidente del JK 5022 en Barajas|publisher=El Mundo|date=7 September 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/09/16/316060/spanair-md-82-crash-inquiry-battles-to-understand-absent-flap-warning.html|title=Spanair MD-82 crash inquiry battles to understand absent flap warning|work=Flight International |date=16 September 2008[/tpl]
James W. Hudspeth, an investigator of a previous near accident (an MD-83, starting from Lanzarote) that was astonishingly similar in its details, pointed out that the fuse of the so-called "left ground control relay" at position K-33 of the control panel might have been the actual culprit of the erroneous flight mode: Hudspeth found out during a 2 week investigation at Lanzarote, that it is customary in normal maintenance routine to temporarily remove this fuse to engage flight mode - however the fuse is afterwards sometimes not replaced correctly. Because of the frequent handling of this fuse, it is also not easy to visually check that the fuse is properly functioning (as is customary for the pilots to do when they enter the cockpit). Hudspeth speculates that this may both have happened with JK 5022 and Northwest Airlines Flight 255.[tpl]cite web|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2008/10/05/espana/1223157601_850215.html|title=Avisé a España que podía pasar lo del MD y no hicieron nada|publisher=El Mundo|date=5 October 2008[/tpl]

====Malware====

Spanish daily El Pais reports that malware which had infected the airline's central computer system resulted in a failure to raise an alarm over multiple problems with the plane. An internal report issued by the airline revealed that their central computer system used to monitor technical problems with the aircraft was infected with malware and may have prevented the detection of technical problems with the aircraft. A judge has ordered Spanair to provide all of the computer's logs from the days before and after the crash.

CIAIAC's interim report specifically mentioned three other fatal accidents caused by the failure to deploy flaps and slats prior to take-off: Northwest Airlines Flight 255, Delta Air Lines Flight 1141, and Mandala Airlines Flight 091.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fomento.es/NR/rdonlyres/9AA08FE0-1151-41A0-9A57-9C5DF8BF6F8E/52877/2008_032_A_INTERINO_01_ENG1.pdf|title=Interim Report A-032/1998|publisher=CIAIAC|page=34[/tpl]
In the case of Northwest Airlines Flight 255, also an MD-82, the crew had similarly been disrupted from routine operation before the fatal takeoff, and the alarm similarly had not sounded. In that accident, the reason for the lack of TOWS alarm was a tripped (or pulled) circuit breaker. However, examination of the alarm and its circuit breaker in Spanair 5022 had not revealed any fault.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4597009.ece|title=Spanair crash recalls 1987 Detroit disaster|work=The Times |location=UK |date=24 August 2008  | first=Paul | last=Eddy | accessdate=23 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR88-05.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=NTSB|title=Aircraft Accident Report, Northwest Airlines 255|date=16 August 1987[/tpl]
