The group was originally composed of Jay Tee and Baby Beesh in 1997 on the album Latino Velvet Project.

Velvet City featured several west coast artists including: E-40, Levitti, Rappin' 4-Tay, Bosko, Cool Nutz, Poppa LQ and The Mary Jane Girls. Don Cisco has remained a presence on all six Latino Velvet albums, either as a group member or featured performer.
Don Cisco's first album Til The Wheels Fall Off was released in 1998 and is currently out of print. The album was released under his early moniker Cisco the Frisco Mack.  In 2000 he released Oh Boy.  Don Cisco has remained an underground presence in Northern California since his debut over a decade ago.
