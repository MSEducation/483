Dieckmann and Hell submitted their application to the German patent office in April 1925, and a patent was issued in October 1927. Their experiments on the image dissector were announced in the volume 8 (September 1927) of the popular magazine Discovery[ref]

In January 1927, Farnsworth applied for a patent for his Television System that included a device for "the conversion and dissecting of light".
Its first moving image was successfully transmitted on September 7 of 1927,[ref]

and a patent was issued in 1930. Farnsworth quickly made improvements to the device, among them introducing an electron multiplier made  of nickel[ref]
