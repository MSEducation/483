Wade Miller (born June 10, 1973) is a retired professional Canadian football player and the current President and Chief Executive Officer of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League.

==Football career==

After four seasons with the Manitoba Bisons, Miller was drafted by the Blue Bombers in the fourth round (37th overall) in the 1995 CFL Draft. He played 11 seasons in the CFL, all with the Blue Bombers, appearing in 159 regular season games and eight playoff games. Drafted as a linebacker, Miller moved to fullback because of his small stature and was a fixture on the Blue Bombers special teams. He was twice named to the CFL East Division All-Star team (1997, 1999) and is the league's all-time leader in special teams tackles with 184.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Football/CFL/Winnipeg/2006/03/25/1505298-sun.html|title=Blue's Miller calls it quits |publisher=Winnipeg Sun|date=|accessdate=2013-08-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bluebombers.com/article/miller_announces_his_retirement|title=Miller Announces His Retirement |publisher=BlueBombers.com|date=2006-03-21|accessdate=2013-08-10[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/2013/08/09/gifted-visionary---teammates-business-partners-weigh-in-on-miller-taking-over-bombers-top-job|title=Teammates, business partners weigh in on Miller taking over Bombers top job|date=2013-08-09|accessdate=2013-08-12|publisher=Winnipeg Sun[/tpl]
