==Quotes==

Chandra Mayor on writing:
 
 "Telling the truth is harder than telling lies. Which makes writing hard work. But it's also what makes it resonate, makes it mean something to the person who reads it. Writing is exhibitionism. Writing is dragging something out of you, kicking and screaming. Writing is also craft, which is only achieved through pure drudgery. At the end of it all, someone says, 'you spoke to me,' and it's all worth it." http://www.mbwriter.mb.ca/mapindex/m_profiles/mayor_c.html
