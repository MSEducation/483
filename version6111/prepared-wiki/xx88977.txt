CATEGORIES: Panoz vehicles, Sports cars

The Esperante is a sports car made by Panoz, an American car manufacturer.
There are several models of the Esperante: the base model, the GT, the GTLM, the GTS, and the JRD (an aftermarket upgrade brand similar to Roush Mustangs). Each model has different specifications.  The GTLM, for example, uses a supercharger to boost power from [tpl]convert|305|hp|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|420|hp|abbr=on[/tpl], raising performance from 0-62 mph in 5 seconds to 4 seconds.  The GTS on the other hand is built as a driver's class spec car, to SCCA standards, with harness, roll cage, side bars, etc.  Additionally, it is ~  [tpl]convert|600|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] lighter than the base Esperante, has a steel 5.8 liter V8 racing engine that produces [tpl]convert|385|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on[/tpl], and is made of easily replaceable panels to facilitate small impact race repair.  It can do 0-60 mph in 4.2 seconds, go up to a top speed of [tpl]convert|182|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], and achieve 0.98 g of lateral grip.
Panoz's engines are sourced from The Ford Motor Company's Modular V8 family.
