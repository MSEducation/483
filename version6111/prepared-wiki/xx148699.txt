He is a left-handed batsman who normally plays as an opening bat. He played for England in the 2006 U-19 Cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka.

==Career==

He attended Marley Hill County Primary School, followed by Whickham Comprehensive School. He joined Durham in 2005 and played two seasons in the second eleven, before making his first team debut in 2007. 
He scored fifty in his second match, against Hampshire and his highest score, 101, in a victory over Sussex in September 2007. He has so far been largely restricted to first-class matches, as it is Durham's practice to pick Phil Mustard, the wicket keeper, as an opening batsman in one-day matches. He played in one List A match in 2008.
He is a keen Newcastle United supporter.
