==Manga Sequel?==

Following the conclusion of Gakuen Alice in June of 2013, there have been debates among the fans on whether or not Tachibana Higuchi will create a sequel, due to the ending being left open as a cliffhanger. In a fan website dedicated to the series, it was found that a large percentage of fans wanted to see a sequel that revolves around the journey of Mikan and Natsume's child. According to the fans, their child, a daughter named Hikari, is 12-years-old and is raised in Alice Academy by her grand-uncle after her parents left her at the academy to protect her from the "Alice Hunters". At the school, Hikari befriends a new classmate and comes to understand the hardships of being an Alice, and struggles to understand the purpose of her existence.
