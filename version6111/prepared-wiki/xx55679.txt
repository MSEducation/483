CATEGORIES: Districts of Bavaria, Ebersberg (district)

Ebersberg is a district in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Erding, Mühldorf, Rosenheim and Munich.

==History==

The most important event in the district's history was the battle of Hohenlinden on December 3, 1800, which was a part of the Napoleonic Wars.

==Geography==

The district includes rural areas east of the city of Munich. Despite the vicinity of Munich urbanisation is low. In the north there is a contiguous forest area of 80 km², serving as recreation area for the population of the Bavarian capital. The forest consists of three separate unincorporated areas, Anzinger Forst, Ebersberger Forst, and Eglhartinger Forst.

==Coat of arms==

The arms display both parts of the word "Ebersberg": a boar (German "Eber") standing on a mountain (German "Berg"). These two symbols are part of the arms of the city of Ebersberg as well. In addition the district's arms include a fir, symbolising the forests of the region.
