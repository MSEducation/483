[[Experimental College (movement)]]

CATEGORIES: Experimental schools

The Experimental College Movement (also referred to as EXCO or EC) has taken several forms historically, but is generally a school within a school, based out of a college or university, that offers classes taught by not just traditional professors, but students and community members as well (often without grades and often free of charge or in some way associated with social or curricular change).
In the 1960s the idea took the form of a movement, with Experimental Colleges arising at San Francisco State College (later San Francisco State University) in 1964-65, at Tufts UniversityTufts University: The Experimental College and the University of California, Davis, in 1966,Experimental College [tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] and the University of Washingtonexco.org :: Experimental College and Oberlin College in 1968.ExCo Has a New Home! In addition to these projects, which still exist today, some Experimental Colleges came in and out of existence, such as the Tussman Experimental College at the University of California, Berkeley, and at the University of Southern California.Experimental College // SCampus These projects reflect different approaches to the concept: some hold fast to the principle of cost-free courses, some offer courses for credit, some emphasize a community focus. More recently established Experimental Colleges exist at HaverfordExperimental College [tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] and in the Twin Cities.EXCO: Experimental Community Education of the Twin Cities | Formerly known as "Experimental College of the Twin Cities"
And while EXCOs draw upon a long history of many radical community movements including Popular Education, Free Schools[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl], Freedom Schools, Work Peoples' Colleges, etc., the original concept is often attributed to Alexander Meiklejohn, who spearheaded such a project at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and authored a book about the experience, The Experimental College, in 1932.The University: The experimental college: Contents
