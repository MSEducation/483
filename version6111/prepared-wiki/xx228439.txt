Bedlingtonshire Community High School (BCHS) is a Maths and Computing College located in Bedlington, Northumberland in the North East of England. It is named after the former area of Bedlingtonshire, and the local area became Wansbeck district  until 2009.

==History==

It was founded in 1926 as Bedlington Secondary School for the areas of Bedlingtonshire, Ashington and Newbiggin, being built next to Bedlington railway station. Subsequently it became Bedlington Grammar School, before turning comprehensive in 1974. It gained Maths and Computing College status in 2009.

==Admissions==

The school is situated in Bedlington Station, just west of the junction of the A189 and A1147, and near the A189 bridge over the River Blyth. All secondary schools in Northumberland have a sixth form.
Admissions are in Years 7 and 9 - Year 7 students come from the two feeder primary schools, Bedlington Station Primary School and Stead Lane Primary School; whilst Year 9 students come from the three tier system from Meadowdale Academy and Guidepost Middle School.
