Louis Lozowick (December 10, 1892 – September 9, 1973) (ukr: Луї Лозовик) was an American painter and printmaker. He was born in the Russian Empire (Ludvinovka, Ukraine), came to the United States in 1906, and died in New Jersey in 1973. He is recognized as an Art Deco and Precisionist artist, and mainly produced streamline, urban-inspired monochromatic lithographs in a career that spanned 50 years.

==Career==

Lozowick attended Kiev Art School from 1904-1906 before he emigrated to the USA, where he continued his studies at the National Academy of Design (New York) and Ohio State University. From 1919 to 1924 Lozowick lived and traveled throughout Europe, spending most of his time in Paris, Berlin and Moscow. In the mid-1920s he started making his first lithographs.

These hard-edged, linear styles, evident in a lithograph called "New York (Brooklyn Bridge)," suggest the possibility of an efficient reframing of the world, as did the political theories espoused in New Masses. A version of this lithograph was planned as a cover for New Masses that was never published.
Lozowick was highly interested in the development of the Russian avant-garde and even published a monograph on Russian Constructivism entitled Modern Russian Art.
In 1943 Lozowick moved to New Jersey where he continued to paint and make prints. The human condition remained a constant theme of his art, and an ongoing interest in nature appears more frequently in his later works.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

Lozowick married Adele Turner in 1933 and moved a few years later to South Orange, New Jersey, where their son Lee Lozowick was born on November 18, 1943.
