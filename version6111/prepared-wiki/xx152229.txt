The Haunted World of El Superbeasto is a 2009 animated exploitation musical horror comedy film based on the comic book series created by Rob Zombie.

==Plot==

The film follows the adventures of El Superbeasto (Tom Papa), a suave, yet violent exploitation film actor/director and former masked wrestler, and his sultry "sidekick" and sister, the super-agent Suzi-X (Sheri Moon Zombie), as they prevent the evil Dr. Satan (Paul Giamatti) from taking over the world by marrying the foul-mouthed stripper Velvet Von Black (Rosario Dawson) with the mark of the devil on her backside. The adventure, set in the mythic world of Monsterland, also features Murray the Robot (Brian Posehn), Suzi-X's sidekick and vehicle, based on the robot featured in the 1939 serial The Phantom Creeps starring Bela Lugosi.THE HAUNTED WORLD OF EL SUPERBEASTO (DVD REVIEW)
Director Rob Zombie also references several other films. Tom Papa, writer and the voice of the titular character, incorporated his style of humor to his character. Throughout the film, El Superbeasto often makes observations in unusual moments, like Papa does in his stand-ups.

Work began on The Haunted World of El Superbeasto in 2006 and a release date was later scheduled for May 2007, but the film was completed in 2009. In an interview conducted on July 20, 2007 by shocktillyoudrop.com, Zombie explained that, "Nothing really much happening." During that time, the film was still being animated, however, Zombie then began work on Halloween. He informed the animators that he had "to walk away because I can't split my time between two things". Zombie noted that work on The Haunted World of El Superbeasto "started when I was on Rejects and it's now just sitting on a shelf waiting for me to finish Halloween".[tpl]cite web| publisher= Shocktillyoudrop| url= http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=825 | title=News: EXCL: Rob Zombie Interview | accessdate= July 20, 2007[/tpl]

IGN's March 20, 2009 exclusive interview with Rob Zombie revealed that "Haunted World of El Superbeasto was finished, but its release had been delayed because of ownership and legal issues within the company that made the movie, Starz Media." In that same interview, Rob Zombie described the film as "Awesome...this little tiny half-a-million dollar direct-to-video movie that expanded into this $10 million animated extravaganza. And it's awesome, but I don't have a release date yet. It's like an R-rated adult/monster/sex comedy. There's nothing really like it that I can think of. People always say like Ralph Bakshi's stuff, but...it's more like if SpongeBob and Scooby-Doo were filthy."[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/964/964983p1.html|title=Exclusive: Zombie Talks T-Rex|author=Scott Collura[/tpl] The film, running feature length at 75 minutes, was released on DVD on September 22 of that year.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/16569|title='The Haunted World of El Superbeasto' Finally Getting Released![/tpl] A majority of the songs in the film are performed by the comedy duo Hard 'n Phirm.
