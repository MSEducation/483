[[Compressive strength]]

CATEGORIES: Materials science

In the study of strength of materials, the compressive strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size. It can be measured by plotting applied force against deformation in a testing machine. 
Some material fracture at their compressive strength limit; others deform irreversibly, so a given amount of deformation may be considered as the limit for compressive load. 
Compressive strength is a key value for design of structures. 
Compressive strength is often measured on a universal testing machine;  these  range from very small table-top systems  to ones with over 53 MN[tpl]Elucidate|date=January 2014[/tpl] capacity.[ref]
