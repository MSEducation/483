A music video was created for the song in 1970, which depicted the band and friends riding bicycles through the streets of Melbourne. Filmed in black and white, it was notable for scenes involving a procession of bicycles (including a penny farthing) and rollerskaters on a busy six-lane Melbourne arterial road, and a scene of four members of the band 'riding' a tandem bicycle atop a car transporter travelling at speed across a bridge.
Australia's Young Talent Time also performed "The Pushbike Song" during one of their episodes in 1986. 
The Australian children's show Play School recorded a version of this song for the album There's A Bear In There, sung by Philip Quast.
In 2012 "The Pushbike Song" was used on an advertising campaign for Tooheys 5 Seeds Cloudy Cider. The vocals on that version are purportedly a performance by "gypsy banjo player, Benny 'The Giant' Gogasa" recorded via Skype.[tpl]cite web|title=Tooheys 5 Seeds set to put a twist on cider in new campaign breaking this Sunday via BMF Sydney|url=http://www.campaignbrief.com/2012/01/tooheys-5-seeds-set-to-put-a-t.html|work=Toohey's 5 Seed Commercial|accessdate=2012-02-20[/tpl] This is probably a spoof on the part of the advertising agency, for what appears to be a local studio recording, with no independent evidence that Benny 'The Giant' Gogasa and "his band of orphans, misfits and mildly deformed gypsy musicians" actually exists.
It was also heard in the Hotch Potch House episode Round and Round during a film about a girl getting a new bike.
