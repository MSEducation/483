Martin Andrew Green AM ForMemRS (born 20 July 1948) is an Australian professor at the University of New South Wales  who works on solar energy.[tpl]Scopus|id=35554004500[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1002/pip.2163|noedit[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1063/1.122345|noedit[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1063/1.2734885|noedit[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1002/pip.1088|noedit[/tpl]

==Education==

Green was born in Brisbane and was educated at the selective Brisbane State High School, graduated from University of Queensland and completed his PhD on a Commonwealth Scholarship at McMaster University in Canada, where he specialised in solar energy. In 1974, at the University of New South Wales, he initiated the Solar Photovoltaics Group which soon worked on the development of silicon solar cells. The group had their success in the early 80s through producing a 20% efficient silicon cell, which now has been improved to 25%.

==Research==

Green has published several books on solar cells both for popular science and deep research. The “buried contact solar cell” was developed at UNSW in 1984.http://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/QeJ5maLQQrugiSYMF3ATDA/2.2.6.green_06.pdf Green also serves on the Board of the Sydney-based Pacific Solar Pty Ltd. (now known as CSG Solar), as Research Director. Green's portrait was painted with fellow scientist, Ross Garnaut for the Archibald Prize 2010. The painting was a finalist, losing to a portrait of Tim Minchin.

==Awards and honours==

Green has received several awards including:
His nomination for the Royal Society reads: [tpl]centered pull quote|Professor Green is cited for his extensive and distinguished contributions to photovoltaic science and technology. These include identifying the fundamental limits upon silicon solar cell performance and then leading his team to demonstrate experimental devices approaching this limit, with 25% cell efficiency now demonstrated. This is over 50% relatively higher in performance than at the beginning of his work. He has also developed innovative commercial versions of these high performance devices and pioneered the field of “third generation” photovoltaics, investigating advanced photovoltaic device concepts targeting Carnot-like solar conversion efficiencies.[/tpl]
