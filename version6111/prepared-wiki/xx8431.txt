The neutron is a subatomic hadron particle that has the symbol [tpl]SubatomicParticle|Neutron[/tpl] or [tpl]SubatomicParticle|Neutron0[/tpl]. Neutrons have no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. With the exception of hydrogen-1, the nucleus of every atom consists of at least one or more of both protons and neutrons. Protons and neutrons are collectively referred to as "nucleons". Since interacting protons have a mutual electromagnetic repulsion that is stronger than their attractive nuclear interaction, neutrons are often a necessary constituent within the atomic nucleus that allows a collection of protons to stay atomically bound (see diproton & neutron-proton ratio).Sir James Chadwick’s Discovery of Neutrons. ANS Nuclear Cafe. Retrieved on 2012-08-16. Neutrons bind with protons and one another in the nucleus via the nuclear force, effectively stabilizing it. The number of neutrons in the nucleus of an atom is referred to as its neutron number, which reveals the specific isotope of that atom. For example, the abundant carbon-12 isotope has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, whereas the rare radioactive carbon-14 isotope also has 6 protons but, instead, 8 neutrons. Elements may be found in nature as only one isotope or with as many as 10 isotopes (manganese and tin, respectively).
While the bound neutrons in nuclei can be stable (depending on the nuclide), free neutrons are unstable; they undergo beta decay with a mean lifetime of just under 15 minutes ([tpl]val|881.5|1.5|u=s[/tpl]). Free neutrons are produced in nuclear fission and fusion. Dedicated neutron sources like neutron generators, research reactors and spallation sources produce free neutrons for use in irradiation and in neutron scattering experiments. Even though it is not a chemical element, the free neutron is sometimes included in tables of nuclides.Nudat 2. Nndc.bnl.gov. Retrieved on 2010-12-04.
The neutron has been key to the production of nuclear power. The neutron was discovered in 1932, and in 1933, it was realized that it might mediate a nuclear chain reaction. In the 1930s, neutrons were used to produce many different types of nuclear transmutations. When nuclear fission was discovered in 1938, it became clear that, if the process also produced neutrons, this might be the mechanism to produce the neutrons for a chain reaction. This was proven in 1939, opening the path to nuclear power production. These events and findings led directly to the first self-sustaining, man-made, nuclear chain reaction (Chicago Pile-1, 1942) and to the first nuclear weapons (1945).

In 1920, Ernest Rutherford conceived the possible existence of the neutron.[ref]

</ref> In particular, Rutherford considered that the disparity found between the atomic number of an atom and its atomic mass could be explained by the existence of a neutrally charged particle within the atomic nucleus. He considered the neutron to be a neutral double consisting of an electron orbiting a proton.<ref>[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1920.0040|jstor=93888|title=Bakerian Lecture.

Through the 1920s, physicists had generally accepted an (incorrect) model of the atomic nucleus as composed of protons and electrons.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.2995181|title=The idea of the neutrino|year=1978|last1=Brown|first1=Laurie M.|journal=Physics Today|volume=31|issue=9|pages=23[/tpl]Friedlander G., Kennedy J.W. and Miller J.M. (1964) Nuclear and Radiochemistry (2nd edition), Wiley, pp. 22–23 and 38–39 It was known that atomic nuclei usually had about half as many positive charges than if they were composed completely of protons, and in existing models this was often explained by proposing that nuclei also contained some "nuclear electrons" to neutralize the excess charge. Thus, the nitrogen-14 nucleus would be composed of 14 protons and 7 electrons to give it a charge of +7 but a mass of 14 atomic mass units.
The new quantum mechanics implied that a particle as light as the electron could not be contained in a region as small as the nucleus with any reasonable energy. In 1930 Viktor Ambartsumian and Dmitri Ivanenko in the USSR found that, contrary to the prevailing opinion of the time, the nucleus cannot consist of protons and electrons. They proved that some neutral particles must be present besides the protons.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10511-008-9016-6|title=V. A.

In 1931, Walther Bothe and Herbert Becker in Germany found that if the very energetic alpha particles emitted from polonium fell on certain light elements, specifically beryllium, boron, or lithium, an unusually penetrating radiation was produced. At first this radiation was thought to be gamma radiation, although it was more penetrating than any gamma rays known, and the details of experimental results were very difficult to interpret on this basis.[tpl]cite journal |doi =10.1007/BF01390908 |title =Künstliche Erregung von Kern-γ-Strahlen |trans_title = Artificial excitation of nuclear γ-radiation |year =1930 |last1 =Bothe |first1 =W. |last2 =Becker |first2 =H. |journal =Zeitschrift für Physik |volume =66 |issue =5–6 |page =289|bibcode = 1930ZPhy...66..289B [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi =10.1007/BF01336726 |title =Die in Bor und Beryllium erregten γ-Strahlen |trans_title = Γ-rays excited in boron and beryllium|year =1932 |last1 =Becker |first1 =H. |last2 =Bothe |first2 =W. |journal =Zeitschrift für Physik |volume =76 |issue =7–8 |page =421|bibcode = 1932ZPhy...76..421B [/tpl] The next important contribution was reported in 1932 by Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot in Paris.[tpl]cite journal|author=Joliot-Curie, Irène and Joliot, Frédéric | url = http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=NUMM-3147&I=1236 | title = Émission de protons de grande vitesse par les substances hydrogénées sous l'influence des rayons γ très pénétrants |trans_title = Emission of high-speed protons by hydrogenated substances under the influence of very penetrating γ-rays |volume=194|page= 273 |year=1932|journal= Comptes Rendus[/tpl] They showed that if this unknown radiation fell on paraffin, or any other hydrogen-containing compound, it ejected protons of very high energy. This was not in itself inconsistent with the assumed gamma ray nature of the new radiation, but detailed quantitative analysis of the data became increasingly difficult to reconcile with such a hypothesis.
In 1932, James Chadwick performed a series of experiments at the University of Cambridge, showing that the gamma ray hypothesis was untenable.[ref]
