==Administrative divisions==

Chongqing is the largest of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China. The municipality is divided into 38 subdivisions (3 were abolished in 1997, and Wansheng and Shuangqiao districts were abolished in October 2011[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.163.com/11/1027/18/7HD2AKAQ00014JB5.html |title=重庆调整部分行政区划：4区(县)并为2区 |publisher=News.163.com |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]), consisting of 19 districts, 15 counties, and 4 autonomous counties.

The urban area of Chongqing Municipality (重庆主城区市区) includes the following districts:[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.cqnews.net/html/2012-02/06/content_12600713.htm |title=Chongqing's Divisions |publisher=English.cqnews.net |date=2012-02-06 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]

===Cityscape===

==Demographics==

According to a July 2010 article from the official Xinhua news agency, the municipality has a population of 32.8 million, including 23.3 million farmers. Among them, 8.4 million farmers have become migrant workers, including 3.9 million working and living in urban areas of Chongqing.[ref]
</ref>
This would mean that the locally registered farmers who work in other jurisdictions number 4.5 million, reducing the local, year-round population of Chongqing in 2010 to 28.3 million, plus those who are registered in other jurisdictions but live and work in Chongqing. According to China's 2005 statistical yearbook, of a total population of 30.55 million, those with residence registered in other jurisdictions but residing in the Chongqing enumeration area numbered 1.4 million, including 46,000 who resided in Chongqing "for less than half year". An additional 83,000 had registered in Chongqing, but not yet settled there.[ref]

The 2005 statistical yearbook also lists 15.22 million (49.82%) males and 15.33 million (50.18%) females.
In terms of age distribution in 2004, of the 30.55 million total population, 6.4 million (20.88%) were age 0–14, 20.7 million (67.69%) were 15–64, and 3.5 million (11.46%) were 65 and over.[ref]

==Politics and military==

The politics of Chongqing is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in the People's Republic of China. The Mayor of Chongqing is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Chongqing. Since Chongqing is a centrally administered municipality, the mayor occupies the same level in the order of precedence as provincial governors. However, in the city's dual party-government governing system, the mayor has less power than the Chongqing Communist Party of China Municipal Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the "Chongqing CPC Party Chief".[tpl]cite web|last=Page |first=Jeremy |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304459804577282280904864936.html |title=Chongqing Party Chief Position |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]

In addition, more than 1,300 people moved into the city daily, adding almost 100 million yuan (US$15 million) to the local economy.

===Economic and technological development zones===

The city includes a number of economic and technological development zones:
Chongqing itself is part of the West Triangle Economic Zone, along with Chengdu and Xi'an.

==Transport==

Since its elevation to national-level municipality in 1997, the city has dramatically expanded its transportation infrastructure. With the construction of railways and expressways to the east and southeast, Chongqing is a major transportation hub in southwestern China. The municipality now has 25 bridges across the Yangtze River including half a dozen in the city's urban core.Chongqing Urban Bridges

===River port===

Chongqing is one of the most important inland ports in China. There are numerous luxury cruise ships that terminate at Chongqing, cruising downstream along the Yangtze River to Yichang, Wuhan, Nanjing or even Shanghai.Chongqing's Cruise Industry In the recent past, this provided virtually the only transportation option along the river. However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduce or been cancelled altogether, thus most of the river ferry traffic consists of mostly leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several port handling facilities exists throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://service-industries-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/Transport-Logistics/Chongqing-River-Port-S-Container-Volume-Increases-16-9pc-In-May/spgz/en/1/1X000000/1X07JEN7.htm |title=Chongqing Ports Details |publisher=Service-industries-research.hktdc.com |date=2011-07-19 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]

===Railways===

Major train stations in Chongqing:
Chongqing is a major freight destination for rail with continued development with improved handling facilities. Due to subsidies and incentives, the relocation and construction of many factories in Chongqing has seen a huge increase in rail traffic.
Chongqing is a major rail hub nationally.

===Highways===

Traditionally, the road network in Chongqing has been narrow, winding and limited to smaller vehicles because of the natural terrain, large rivers and the huge population demands on the area, especially in the Yuzhong District. In other places, such as Jiangbei, large areas of homes and buildings have recently been cleared to improve the road network and create better urban planning. This has seen many tunnels and large bridges needing to be built across the city. Construction of many expressways have connected Chongqing to neighbouring provinces. Several ring roads have also been constructed. The natural mountainous terrain that Chongqing is built on makes many road projects difficult to construct, including for example some of the world's highest road bridges.[tpl]cite web|author=Simon Black |url=http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-07-12/markets/30008153_1_chongqing-china-building |title=Chongqing: World's Largest Construction Project |publisher=Articles.businessinsider.com |date=2011-07-12 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]
Unlike many other Chinese cities, it is rare for motorbikes, electric scooters or bicycles to be seen on Chongqing Roads. This is due to the extremely hilly and mountainous nature of Chongqing's roads and streets.

===Public transport===

The three main forms of public transport in Chongqing are CRT metro, intercity railway, and the ubiquitous bus system.
According to the Chongqing Municipal Government's ambitious plan in May 2007, Chongqing is investing 150 billion RMB over 13 years to finish a system that combines underground metro lines with light rail (heavy monorail). By 2020 this network will consist of 6 straight lines and 1 circular line; Line 1 and Line 6 are underground subway while Lines 2 and 3 are High Capacity monorail. These improvements will add [tpl]convert|363.5|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] of road and railway to the existing transportation infrastructure and 93 new train stations will be added to the 111 stations that are already in place.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.cqnews.net/html/node_15162.htm |title=Chongqing City Transport |publisher=English.cqnews.net |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]

==Culture==

===Language===

The language native to Chongqing is Southwestern Mandarin. More precisely, the great majority of the municipality, save for Xiushan, speak Sichuanese, including the primary Chengdu-Chongqing dialect and Minjiang dialect spoken in Jiangjin and Qijiang. There are also a few speakers of Xiang and Hakka in the municipality, due to the great immigration wave to the Sichuan region (湖广填四川) during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. In addition, in parts of southeastern Chongqing, the Miao and Tujia languages are also used by some Miao and Tujia people.[ref]

===Tourism===

As the provisional Capital of China for almost ten years (1937 to 1945), the city was also known as one of the three headquarters of the Allies during World War II, as well as being a strategic center of many other wars throughout China's history. Chongqing has many historic war-time buildings or sites, some of which have since been destroyed. These sites include the People's Liberation Monument, located in the center of Chongqing city. It used to be the highest building in the area, but is now surrounded and dwarfed by numerous shopping centres.
