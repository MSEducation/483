[[Heredity]]

CATEGORIES: Genetics

Heredity is the passing of traits to offspring from its parents or ancestor. This is the process by which an offspring cell or organism acquires or becomes predisposed to the characteristics of its parent cell or organism. Through heredity, variations exhibited by individuals can accumulate and cause some species to evolve. The study of heredity in biology is called genetics, which includes the field of epigenetics.

==Overview==

In humans, eye color is an example of an inherited characteristic: an individual might inherit the "brown-eye trait" from one of the parents.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sturm RA, Frudakis TN |title=Eye colour: portals into pigmentation genes and ancestry |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=327–32 |year=2004 |pmid=15262401 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2004.06.010 |ref=harv[/tpl] Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's genome is called its genotype.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pearson H |title=Genetics: what is a gene? |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=398–401 |year=2006 |pmid=16724031 |doi=10.1038/441398a |ref=harv|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..398P [/tpl]
The complete set of observable traits of the structure and behavior of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits arise from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.[tpl]cite journal |author=Visscher PM, Hill WG, Wray NR |title=Heritability in the genomics era—concepts and misconceptions |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=255–66 |year=2008 |pmid=18319743 |doi=10.1038/nrg2322 |ref=harv[/tpl] As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's phenotype and sunlight;[tpl]cite journal | title=PGC-1 coactivators regulate MITF and the tanning response | author=Shoag J | journal=Mol Cell |date=Jan 2013 | volume=49 | issue=1 | pages=145–57 | doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2012.10.027 | pmid=23201126 | last2=Haq | first2=Rizwan | last3=Zhang | first3=Mingfeng | last4=Liu | first4=Laura | last5=Rowe | first5=Glenn C. | last6=Jiang | first6=Aihua | last7=Koulisis | first7=Nicole | last8=Farrel | first8=Caitlin | last9=Amos | first9=Christopher I.| author-separator= | displayauthors=1 [/tpl] thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in their genotype:[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/dermatologia-venereologia/article.php?cod=R23Y2010N01A0037 | title=Genetics of pigmentation and melanoma predisposition | author=Pho LN, Leachman SA. | journal=G Ital Dermatol Venereol. |date=Feb 2010 | volume=145 | issue=1 | pages=37–45 | pmid=20197744[/tpl] a striking example is people with the inherited trait of albinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn.[tpl]cite journal |author=Oetting WS, Brilliant MH, King RA |title=The clinical spectrum of albinism in humans |journal=Molecular medicine today |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=330–5 |year=1996 |pmid=8796918 |doi=10.1016/1357-4310(96)81798-9 |ref=harv[/tpl]
Heritable traits are known to be passed from one generation to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long polymer that incorporates four types of bases, which are interchangeable. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specifies the genetic information: this is comparable to a sequence of letters spelling out a passage of text.[tpl]cite book |last=Griffiths |first=Anthony, J. F. |title=Introduction to Genetic Analysis |year=2012 |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4292-2943-2 | page=3 |edition=10 |coauthors=Wessler, Susan R., Carroll, Sean B., Doebley J[/tpl] Before a cell divides through mitosis, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. A portion of a DNA molecule that specifies a single functional unit is called a gene; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. Organisms inherit genetic material from their parents in the form of homologous chromosomes, containing a unique combination of DNA sequences that code for genes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a particular locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.[tpl]cite book |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas J. |authorlink=Douglas J.

However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by multiple interacting genes within and among organisms.[tpl]cite journal |author=Phillips PC |title=Epistasis—the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems |journal=Nat.

Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by direct agency of the DNA molecule. These phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems that are causally or independently evolving over genes. Research into modes and mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance is still in its scientific infancy, however, this area of research has attracted much recent activity as it broadens the scope of heritability and evolutionary biology in general.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Jablonka|first1=E.|last2=Raz|first2=G.|title=Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance: Prevalence, mechanisms, and implications for the study of heredity and evolution|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=84|issue=2|pages=131–176|year=2009|url=http://compgen.unc.edu/wiki/images/d/df/JablonkaQtrRevBio2009.pdf|pmid=19606595|doi=10.1086/598822[/tpl] DNA methylation marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by RNA interference, and the three dimensional conformation of proteins (such as prions) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Bossdorf|first1=O.|last2=Arcuri|first2=D.|last3=Richards|first3=C.

For example, ecological inheritance through the process of niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effect that modifies and feeds back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors.[tpl]cite journal|title=Perspective: Seven reasons (not) to neglect niche construction|last1 =Laland|first1 =K.

==Relation to theory of evolution==

When Charles Darwin proposed his theory of evolution in 1859, one of its major problems was the lack of an underlying mechanism for heredity.[tpl]cite book |last=Griffiths |first=Anthony, J. F. |title=Introduction to Genetic Analysis |year=2012 |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4292-2943-2 |page=14 |edition=10 |coauthors=Wessler, Susan R., Carroll, Sean B., Doebley, John[/tpl] Darwin believed in a mix of blending inheritance and the inheritance of acquired traits (pangenesis). Blending inheritance would lead to uniformity across populations in only a few generations and then would remove variation from a population on which natural selection could act.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.genetics.org/content/183/3/757.full | title=Darwin and Genetics | author=Charlesworth, Brian and Charlesworth, Deborah | journal=Genetics November 2009 vol. 183 no. 3 757–766 |date=November 2009 | volume=183 | issue=3 | pages=757–766 | doi=10.1534/genetics.109.109991[/tpl] This led to Darwin adopting some Lamarckian ideas in later editions of On the Origin of Species and his later biological works.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.biosignaling.com/content/9/1/30 | title=The next evolutionary synthesis: from Lamarck and Darwin to genomic variation and systems biology | author=Bard, Jonathan BL | journal=Cell Communication and Signaling | year=2011 | volume=9 | issue=30 | doi=10.1186/1478-811X-9-30 | pages=30[/tpl] Darwin's primary approach to heredity was to outline how it appeared to work (noticing that traits that were not expressed explicitly in the parent at the time of reproduction could be inherited, that certain traits could be sex-linked, etc.) rather than suggesting mechanisms.
Darwin's initial model of heredity was adopted by, and then heavily modified by, his cousin Francis Galton, who laid the framework for the biometric school of heredity.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/francisgalton.aspx | title=Francis Galton (1822-1911) | publisher=Science Museum | accessdate=March 26, 2013[/tpl] Galton found no evidence to support the aspects of Darwin's pangenesis model, which relied on acquired traits.[tpl]cite journal | title=A new perspective on Darwin's Pangenesis | author=Liu Y. | journal=Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc. |date=May 2008 | volume=83 | issue=2 | pages=141–9 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2008.00036.x | pmid=18429766[/tpl]
The inheritance of acquired traits was shown to have little basis in the 1880s when August Weismann cut the tails off many generations of mice and found that their offspring continued to develop tails.[tpl]cite book | title=The Biology of Belief: Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter and Miracles | publisher=Hay House, Inc | author=Lipton, Bruce H. | year=2008 | pages=12 | isbn=9781401923440[/tpl]

==History==

The ancients had a variety of ideas about heredity: Theophrastus proposed that male flowers caused female flowers to ripen;[tpl]cite journal | title=Male and female in Theophrastus's botanical works | author=Negbi, Moshe | journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=Summer 1995 | volume=28 | issue=2 | pages=317–332 | doi=10.1007/BF01059192[/tpl] Hippocrates speculated that "seeds" were produced by various body parts and transmitted to offspring at the time of conception;[tpl]cite book | title=Hippocratic Treatises: On Generation - Nature of the Child - Diseases Ic | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | author=Hipócrates | year=1981 | pages=6 | isbn=9783110079036[/tpl] and Aristotle thought that male and female semen mixed at conception.[tpl]cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-biology/ | title=Aristotle's Biology - 5.2. From Inquiry to Understanding; from hoti to dioti. | publisher=Stanford University | date=Feb 15, 2006 | accessdate=March 26, 2013[/tpl] Aeschylus, in 458 BC, proposed the male as the parent, with the female as a "nurse for the young life sown within her".Eumenides 658-661
Various hereditary mechanisms were envisaged without being properly tested or quantified. These included blending inheritance and the inheritance of acquired traits. Nevertheless, people were able to develop domestic breeds of animals as well as crops through artificial selection. The inheritance of acquired traits also formed a part of early Lamarckian ideas on evolution.
During the 18th century, Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723) discovered "animalcules" in the sperm of humans and other animals.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.leben.us/index.php/component/content/article/59-volume-3-issue-4/236-antoni-van-leeuwenhoeks-amazing-little-animalcules | title=Antoni van Leeuwenhoek's Amazing Little "Animalcules" | publisher=Leben | accessdate=March 26, 2013 | author=Snow, Kurt[/tpl] Some scientists speculated they saw a "little man" (homunculus) inside each sperm. These scientists formed a school of thought known as the "spermists". They contended the only contributions of the female to the next generation were the womb in which the homunculus grew, and prenatal influences of the womb.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | url=http://embryo.asu.edu/view/embryo:125308 | title=Hartsoeker's Homunculus Sketch from Essai de Dioptrique | publisher=Embryo Project Encyclopedia | year=2008 | accessdate=March 26, 2013 | author=Lawrence, Cera R. | issn=1940-5030[/tpl] An opposing school of thought, the ovists, believed that the future human was in the egg, and that sperm merely stimulated the growth of the egg. Ovists thought women carried eggs containing boy and girl children, and that the gender of the offspring was determined well before conception.[tpl]cite book | title=Individual Development and Evolution: The Genesis of Novel Behavior | publisher=Psychology Press | author=Gottlieb, Gilbert | year=2001 | pages=4 | isbn=9781410604422[/tpl]

===Gregor Mendel: father of genetics===

The idea of particulate inheritance of genes can be attributed to the Moravian monk Gregor Mendel who published his work on pea plants in 1865. However, his work was not widely known and was rediscovered in 1901. It was initially assumed the Mendelian inheritance only accounted for large (qualitative) differences, such as those seen by Mendel in his pea plants—and the idea of additive effect of (quantitative) genes was not realised until R. A. Fisher's (1918) paper, "The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance" Mendel's overall contribution gave scientists a useful overview that traits were inheritable. As of today, his pea plant demonstration became the foundation of the study of Mendelian Traits. These traits can be traced on a single locus.Carlson, Neil and et al. Psychology the Science of Behavior, p. 206. Pearson Canada, United States of America. ISBN 978-0-205-64524-4.

===Modern development of genetics and heredity===

In the 1930s, work by Fisher and others resulted in a combination of Mendelian and biometric schools into the modern evolutionary synthesis. The modern synthesis bridged the gap between experimental geneticists and naturalists; and between both and palaeontologists, stating that:Mayr & Provine 1998Mayr E. 1982. The growth of biological thought: diversity, evolution & inheritance. Harvard, Cambs. p. 567 et seq.
The idea that speciation occurs after populations are reproductively isolated has been much debated.[tpl]cite journal | title=Genetic Divergence, Reproductive Isolation, and Marine Speciation | author=Palumbi, Stephen R. | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | year=1994 | volume=25 | pages=547–572 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.25.110194.002555[/tpl] In plants, polyploidy must be included in any view of speciation. Formulations such as 'evolution consists primarily of changes in the frequencies of alleles between one generation and another' were proposed rather later. The traditional view is that developmental biology ('evo-devo') played little part in the synthesis, but an account of Gavin de Beer's work by Stephen Jay Gould suggests he may be an exception.Gould S. J. Ontogeny and phylogeny. Harvard 1977. p. 221–2
Almost all aspects of the synthesis have been challenged at times, with varying degrees of success. There is no doubt, however, that the synthesis was a great landmark in evolutionary biology.[tpl]cite journal | title=Evolution—The Extended Synthesis. A research proposal persuasive enough for the majority of evolutionary biologists? | author=Handschuh, Stephan; Mitteroecker, Philipp | journal=The International Society for Human Ethology |date=June 2012 | volume=27 | issue=1–2 | pages=18–21 | issn=2224-4476[/tpl] It cleared up many confusions, and was directly responsible for stimulating a great deal of research in the post-World War II era.
Trofim Lysenko however caused a backlash of what is now called Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union when he emphasised Lamarckian ideas on the inheritance of acquired traits. This movement affected agricultural research and led to food shortages in the 1960s and seriously affected the USSR.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

===Common genetic disorders===

==Types of heredity==

===Dominant and recessive alleles===

An allele is said to be dominant if it is always expressed in the appearance of an organism (phenotype) provided that at least one copy of it is present. For example, in peas the allele for green pods, G, is dominant to that for yellow pods, g. Thus pea plants with the pair of alleles either GG (homozygote) or Gg (heterozygote) will have green pods. The allele for yellow pods is recessive. The effects of this allele are only seen when it is present in both chromosomes, gg (homozygote).
The description of a mode of biological inheritance consists of three main categories:
These three categories are part of every exact description of a mode of inheritance in the above order. In addition, more specifications may be added as follows:
Determination and description of a mode of inheritance is achieved primarily through statistical analysis of pedigree data. In case the involved loci are known, methods of molecular genetics can also be employed.
