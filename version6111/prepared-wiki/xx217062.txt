Shamir, [http://www.springerlink.com/index/K54H077NP8714058.pdf "Differential cryptanalysis of DES-like cryptosystems"], Journal of Cryptology, vol. 4 num. 1, pp. 3–72, Springer-Verlag, 1991.</ref> According to [[Steven Levy]], IBM discovered differential cryptanalysis,<ref name="levy-dc">Levy, pg. 56</ref> but kept the technique secret at the NSA's request. The technique became publicly known only when Biham and Shamir re-discovered and announced it some years later. The entire affair illustrates the difficulty of determining what resources and knowledge an attacker might actually have.
Another instance of the NSA's involvement was the 1993 Clipper chip affair, an encryption microchip intended to be part of the Capstone cryptography-control initiative. Clipper was widely criticized by cryptographers for two reasons. The cipher algorithm (called Skipjack) was then classified (declassified in 1998, long after the Clipper initiative lapsed). The classified cipher caused concerns that the NSA had deliberately made the cipher weak in order to assist its intelligence efforts. The whole initiative was also criticized based on its violation of Kerckhoffs's Principle, as the scheme included a special escrow key held by the government for use by law enforcement, for example in wiretaps.

===Digital rights management===

Cryptography is central to digital rights management (DRM), a group of techniques for technologically controlling use of copyrighted material, being widely implemented and deployed at the behest of some copyright holders. In 1998, American President Bill Clinton signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which criminalized all production, dissemination, and use of certain cryptanalytic techniques and technology (now known or later discovered); specifically, those that could be used to circumvent DRM technological schemes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf |title=The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-07-18[/tpl] This had a noticeable impact on the cryptography research community since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violated, or might violate, the DMCA. Similar statutes have since been enacted in several countries and regions, including the implementation in the EU Copyright Directive. Similar restrictions are called for by treaties signed by World Intellectual Property Organization member-states.
The United States Department of Justice and FBI have not enforced the DMCA as rigorously as had been feared by some, but the law, nonetheless, remains a controversial one. Niels Ferguson, a well-respected cryptography researcher, has publicly stated that he will not release some of his research into an Intel security design for fear of prosecution under the DMCA.[tpl]Wayback |url=http://www.macfergus.com/niels/dmca/cia.html |date=20011201184919 [/tpl] Both Alan Cox (longtime number 2 in Linux kernel development) and Edward Felten (and some of his students at Princeton) have encountered problems related to the Act. Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested during a visit to the US from Russia, and jailed for five months pending trial for alleged violations of the DMCA arising from work he had done in Russia, where the work was legal. In 2007, the cryptographic keys responsible for Blu-ray and HD DVD content scrambling were discovered and released onto the Internet. In both cases, the MPAA sent out numerous DMCA takedown notices, and there was a massive internet backlash[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,24897,21659892-27317,00.html|title=Digg revolt over HD DVD codes|accessdate=2007-05-20|date=2 May 2007|publisher=news.com.au[/tpl] triggered by the perceived impact of such notices on fair use and free speech.

===Forced disclosure of encryption keys===

In the United Kingdom, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act gives UK police the powers to force suspects to decrypt files or hand over passwords that protect encryption keys. Failure to comply is an offence in its own right, punishable on conviction by a two-year jail sentence or up to five years in cases involving national security. Successful prosecutions have occurred under the Act; the first in 2009,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/11/ripa_iii_figures/ |title=Two convicted for refusal to decrypt data • The Register |first=Christopher Williams |last=Williams |work=theregister.co.uk |date=11 August 2009 |accessdate=18 October 2012[/tpl] resulting in a term of 13 months' imprisonment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/24/ripa_jfl/ |title=UK jails schizophrenic for refusal to decrypt files • The Register |first=Christopher Williams |last=Williams |work=theregister.co.uk |date=24 November 2009 |accessdate=18 October 2012[/tpl]
Similar forced disclosure laws in Australia, Finland, France, and India compel individual suspects under investigation to hand over encryption keys or passwords during a criminal investigation (see Key disclosure law).
In the United States, the federal criminal case of United States v. Fricosu addressed whether a person can be compelled to reveal his or her encryption passphrase or password, despite the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_19669803 |title=Password case reframes Fifth Amendment rights in context of digital world |newspaper=Denver Post |date=January 4, 2012 |first=John |last=Ingold [/tpl] In 2012, the court ruled that under the All Writs Act, the defendant was required to produce an unencrypted hard drive.http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2012/01/decrypt.pdf
In many jurisdictions, the legal status of forced disclosure remains unclear.
