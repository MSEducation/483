[[Guatemalan passport]]

CATEGORIES: Government of Guatemala, Passports by country

Guatemalan Passports are issued to Guatemalan citizens to travel outside of Guatemala. Guatemalan citizens enjoy visa-free access to approximately 100 countries and territories

==Appearance==

Like all Central American passports the cover is navy with gold fonts stating the official name of the country in Spanish and in English, the Guatemalan Coat of Arms in the middle and the words Pasaporte and Passport at the bottom. There is now a newer version of the cover, which has kept many of the old features. The main difference is that now at the top it has the words Centro America and in the middle, instead of the coat of arms, a map of Central America is displayed with the Guatemalan territory shaded. At the bottom the wording changed to depict the type of passport.
Passports have a validity of five years and the languages used are Spanish and English.

===Security features===

The Guatemalan passport contains many security features in it like colored fibers embedded in the pages, a watermark on all pages, and others. Like in the quetzal bills, the passport has an outline of an image on one side and on the other side the image is colored; and when a page is held up against light, the observer is able to see the color on the white outline.
Guatemalan passports are machine readable and contain a PDF417 2D barcode with the holder's biometric information. Because of this detail, no attempts have been made to also include the RFID chip yet.
The passport issuing authority is the Dirección General de Migración (General Immigration Directorship), a dependency of the Ministerio de Gobernación (Ministry of the Interior).
