CATEGORIES: Czechoslovakian military trainer aircraft 1940–1949

The Škoda-Kauba Sk 257 was a Czechoslovakian-built fighter trainer monoplane built by Škoda-Kauba Flugzeugbau for the Luftwaffe.

==Development==

The Škoda-Kauba Flugzeugbau produced the Škoda-Kauba V4 as a single-seat low-wing cantilever monoplane powered by a 240 hp (179 kW) Argus As 10C-3 engine with a retractable tailwheel landing gear. The potential for development was recognized and the German Reichsluftfahrtministerium ordered four prototypes of an enlarged aircraft with a more powerful 485 hp Argus As 410 engine and allocated the designation Sk 257. The four prototypes performed well and the type was ordered into production but the build quality of the prototypes did not pass the Luftwaffe quality control inspections and after only five aircraft had been built the order was cancelled.
