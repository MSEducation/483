Male survivors of the massacre have been subjected to criticism for not intervening to stop Lépine. In an interview immediately after the event, a reporter asked one of the men why they "abandoned" the women when it was clear that Lépine's targets were women.[tpl]cite web|last=Lakeman|first=Lee|title= Women, Violence and the Montreal Massacre|publisher=Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter|url= http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/dec6/leearticle.html|accessdate=April 20, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070419184040/http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/dec6/leearticle.html |archivedate=April 19, 2007[/tpl]  René Jalbert, the sergeant-at-arms who persuaded Denis Lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack, said that someone should have intervened at least to distract Lépine, but acknowledged that "ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror."  Newspaper columnist Mark Steyn suggested that male inaction during the massacre illustrated a "culture of passivity" prevalent among men in Canada, which enabled Lépine's shooting spree: "Yet the defining image of contemporary Canadian maleness is not M Lepine/Gharbi but the professors and the men in that classroom, who, ordered to leave by the lone gunman, meekly did so, and abandoned their female classmates to their fate—an act of abdication that would have been unthinkable in almost any other culture throughout human history."[tpl]cite news | last=Steyn |first=Mark| title = A Culture of Passivity| publisher = National Review| date = April 18, 2007 | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/220650/culture-passivity/mark-steyn| accessdate =April 20, 2007[/tpl]
Male students and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings, but Nathalie Provost, one of the survivors, said that she felt that nothing could have been done to prevent the tragedy, and that her fellow students should not feel guilty.[tpl]cite news| last =Kastor| first =Elizabeth| title =In Montreal, A Survivor Heals After The Horror; 23-Year-Old Student Tried To Reason With Killer| newspaper =The Washington Post| page = B1|date =December 11, 1989[/tpl]
The feminist movement is periodically criticized for appropriating the massacre as a symbol of male violence against women. For example, Charles Rackoff, a University of Toronto computer science professor, compared those organizing vigils marking the event to the Ku Klux Klan. "The point is to use the death of these people as an excuse to promote the feminist/extreme left-wing agenda", he wrote, adding that it is "no more justified" than the KKK using the "murder of a white person by a black person as an excuse to promote their agenda."[tpl]cite news | last = CBC news| title = Professor criticizes Montreal massacre memorials | publisher = CBC| date = December 7, 2000 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2000/12/07/massacre_email001207.html| accessdate =March 7, 2007[/tpl]
Other critics argue that Lépine was a "lone gunman" who does not represent men, and that violence against women is neither condoned nor encouraged officially or unofficially in western culture. In this perspective, feminist memorializing is considered socially divisive on the basis of gender and therefore harmful by bestowing guilt on all men, irrespective of individual propensity to violence against women.[tpl]cite news | last=Kay |first=Barbara| title = Lone gunman: The Ecole Polytechnique massacre was a freak tragedy.

==Commemoration==

Since 1991, the anniversary of the massacre has been designated the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, intended as a call to action against discrimination against women.  A White Ribbon Campaign was launched in 1991 by a group of men in London, Ontario, in wake of the massacre, for the purpose of raising awareness about the prevalence of male violence against women, with the ribbon symbolizing "the idea of men giving up their arms."[tpl]cite news| title =Men wearing white ribbons| publisher =CBC| date = November 27, 1991|url =http://archives.cbc.ca/society/crime_justice/topics/398-2240/|archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20110629023429/http://archives.cbc.ca/society/crime_justice/topics/398-2240/|archivedate =2011-06-29| accessdate =March 7, 2007[/tpl] Commemorative demonstrations are held each year on December 6 across the country in memory of the slain women and numerous memorials have been assembled. In commemoration of the event, December 6 is a day off every year in Polytechnique.
The Place du 6-Décembre-1989 in the Côte-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough of Montreal was created as a memorial to the victims of the massacre. Located at the corner of Decelles Avenue and Queen Mary Road, a short distance from the university, it includes the art installation Nef pour quatorze reines (Nave for Fourteen Queens) by Rose-Marie Goulet.[tpl]cite news | last = CBC news| title = Monument to slain women unveiled | publisher = CBC| date =December 5, 1999 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1999/12/05/memorialsun991205.html  | accessdate =January 4, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071111062104/http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1999/12/05/memorialsun991205.html |archivedate = November 11, 2007[/tpl] It is the site of annual commemorations on December 6.[tpl]cite book |author=Young, Katherine K.; Nathanson, Paul |title=Legalizing misandry: from public shame to systematic discrimination against men |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |location=Montreal |year=2006 |pages= 69–70|isbn=0-7735-2862-8 |oclc= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=cqKxhhu55SMC&pg=PA69[/tpl]
A memorial erected in Vancouver sparked controversy because it was dedicated to "all women murdered by men", which critics say implies all men are potential murderers.[tpl]cite web| last =Campbell| first =Charles| title = Magnets for Memory| publisher =The Tyee| date = November 11, 2004 | url = http://thetyee.ca/Life/2004/11/11/MagnetsforMemory/ | accessdate =December 31, 2006 [/tpl] As a result, women involved in the project received death threats and the Vancouver Park Board subsequently banned any future memorials that might "antagonize" other groups.[tpl]cite web| last = Cooper| first =Rachelle| title = Book a Monument to Canadian Women Murdered by Men| publisher =at Guelph| date = April 19, 2006| url = http://www.uoguelph.ca/atguelph/06-04-19/| accessdate =December 31, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last =Ingram| first =Gordon Brent| title = Contests over social memory in waterfront Vancouver: Historical editing & obfuscation through public art| publisher = on the w@terfront| date = February 2, 2000| url = http://gordonbrentingram.ca/scholarship/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ingram-2000-contests-over-social-memory-in-waterfront-vancouver.pdf| accessdate =December 31, 2006[/tpl]
The event has also been commemorated through references in television, theatre, and popular music. A play about the shootings by Adam Kelly called The Anorak was named as one of the best plays of 2004 by the Montreal Gazette.[tpl]cite web|title=Stage Productions: The Anorak|publisher=Queen's University Faculty of Applied Science|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827224540/http://appsci.queensu.ca/ilc/events/playwritingcomp/anorak.php|accessdate=March 2, 2014[/tpl] A movie entitled Polytechnique, directed by Denis Villeneuve was released in 2009, and sparked controversy over the desirability of reliving the tragedy in a commercial film.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Polytechnique+open+debate/1236248/story.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090418002308/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Polytechnique+open+debate/1236248/story.html|archivedate=2009-04-18|title=Polytechnique: open to debate|last=Kelley|first=Brendan|date=January 1, 2009|work=Montreal Gazette[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Montreal%2Bmassacre%2Bfilm%2Bbrings%2Bmany%2Bmemories/1228750/story.html|title=Montreal massacre film brings up 'too many memories'|last=Hamilton|first=Graeme|date=January 28, 2009|work=National Post |location=Canada |accessdate=November 7, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101023220959/http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Montreal+massacre+film+brings+many+memories/1228750/story.html |archivedate=October 23, 2010[/tpl]
Additionally, several songs have been written about the events in different musical genres, including "Give Us Back The Night" by folk-rock duo Open Mind,"Fascinating Canada:  A Book of Questions and Answers - John Robert Columbo 2011 "Montreal Massacre" by the death metal band Macabre, "This Memory" by the folk duo the Wyrd Sisters, and "14 (for December 6)" by spoken-word artist Evalyn Parry.
In 2008, Marc Lépine's mother Monique published Aftermath, a memoir of her own journey through the grief and pain of the incident. She had stayed silent until 2006, when she decided to speak out for the first time in the wake of that year's Dawson College shooting.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/monique-l%C3%A9pine-marks-montreal-massacre-anniversary-1.809475|title=Monique Lépine marks Montreal Massacre anniversary|publisher=CBC |location=Canada |date=December 2, 2009|accessdate=October 22, 2013[/tpl]
