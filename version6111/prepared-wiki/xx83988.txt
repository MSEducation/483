==Career==

Gould was one of the most prominent American film actors of the early 1970s, best known for playing Trapper John in Robert Altman's satirical 1970 film MASH.  Time magazine placed him on one of its covers in 1970, when he was at the brief height of his long career, calling him a "star for an uptight age".[tpl]cite web|last=Walters|first=Ben|title=It's okay by him|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/aug/11/5|work=Guardian|accessdate=21 July 2012|date=12 August 2008|quote=In 1970, Time magazine put Gould on its cover, declaring him a "Star for an Uptight Age"....[/tpl]
Other notable film roles include performances in Paul Mazursky's 1969 comedy Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (which earned him an Academy Award nomination), California Split (1974), A Bridge Too Far (1977), Capricorn One (1978), and a remake of The Lady Vanishes (1979). 
Gould played the detective Philip Marlowe in Altman's landmark 1973 film noir The Long Goodbye. The role had previously been played by such distinguished actors as Humphrey Bogart and Dick Powell, and would later be essayed by Robert Mitchum, but Gould's naturalistic performance represented Altman's modern, somewhat controversial revision of the material.
He hosted Saturday Night Live six times, his final time being the first episode of the disastrous Jean Doumanian season (season 6) in November 1980, where he was shocked to find that the original cast and producer had left and a new cast and producer had taken their place. He has never hosted after that, but has appeared in a season 16 (1990–1991) episode hosted by Tom Hanks where Hanks is welcomed into the Five-Timers club, a society for celebrities who have hosted SNL five times or more. Also in 1980, Gould filmed two movies for Disney studios, The Last Flight of Noah's Ark (1980) and The Devil and Max Devlin (1981), in which he co-starred with Bill Cosby.
Gould's Broadway theatre credits include Irma La Douce, Say, Darling, I Can Get It for You Wholesale (in which he met Barbra Streisand), Drat! The Cat!, and Little Murders. He purchased the screen rights to Little Murders, and in addition to acting in the film version, served as uncredited executive producer.
His career slowed down after a series of critical and commercial flops in the mid-to-late 1970s, but he has still appeared in a number of supporting and character roles in prominent television shows and movies. He starred in a sitcom called E/R in 1984–1985, and had a notable recurring guest role on Friends as Jack Geller, the father of Monica and Ross Geller. More recently he has had a prominent recurring role on Ray Donovan and is set for a regular role in the upcoming sitcom Mulaney.[tpl]cite web|title=Nasim Pedrad, Elliott Gould Join Fox's "Mulaney"|url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nasim-pedrad-elliott-gould-join-663019|date=December 5, 2013|publisher=Hollywood Reporter | accessdate=February 9, 2014[/tpl]
Gould received critical praise for his performances as an aging mobster in Warren Beatty's 1991 film Bugsy and as the boyfriend of the protagonist's mother in American History X (1998). He also co-starred as Reuben Tishkoff in the popular "caper" film Ocean's Eleven (2001) and its sequels: Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007). Other recent films roles include supporting turns in Contagion (2011) and Ruby Sparks (2012).
