===Art Bank===

The Canada Council has supervisory authority over the Art Bank. The Art Bank is a division of the Canada Council for the Arts whose mandate is to rent works of art to public and private sector offices. It has the largest collection of contemporary Canadian art in the world. The collection includes some 18,000 artworks, 6,400 of which are currently rented to more than 200 government and corporate clients. 
Established in the 1970s the Art Bank buys art from notable Canadian artists through a system of peer review juries. The bank is completely self-funded, earning its money from renting out works in its collection. The Bank continues to expand its collection by buying works in accord with its annual purchasing budget.Purchase Program The vast majority of its art is rented by the Federal government, with less than ten percent being rented to the private sector. Works of art are rented out for two-year periods. The rental rate is generally 20% of the piece's market value. Although the Art Bank is located in Ottawa, Ontario it services its clients across the country.  Its collection has been appraised to be worth over 71 million dollars.Value of Collection
