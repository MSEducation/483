Hal Duncan (born 21 October 1971, real name Alasdair) is a Scottish science fiction and fantasy writer.
His works have been listed in the New Weird genre but he denies that such genre was even known to him at the time of writing his first novel. However, he now seems to have accepted this label and to appreciate it, as proved by the inclusion of one of his stories in an anthology called simply The New Weird and edited by Jeff and Ann VanderMeer.Ann and Jeff VanderMeer (ed.), 2008-02-01, The New Weird, Tachyon Publications, San Francisco (CA), ISBN 978-1-892391-55-1 In general, however, he prefers not to ascribe his writings to any genre.
