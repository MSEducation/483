==Background==

In Copenhagen, the Parken Stadium, which is primary is a football stadium, is the largest indoor arena, with a seated capacity of 38,065. There is a lack of indoor areas with a capacity of 10,000-20,000 in the region. For most international sport events, the Brøndby Hall and Ballerup Super Arena are not big enough, while the Parken Stadium is too big.
For hosting events as the World Men's Handball Championship, Ice Hockey World Championship, FINA World Aquatics Championships, Disney on Ice, and Cirque du Soleil an arena of this size is required

==Financing and operation==

Realdania and Copenhagen Municipality will each make DKK 325,000,000 available for the project, while the Elite Facility Committee is expected to make a construction grant, and operating grants are expected from the National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark. The site is made available by CPH City & Port Development. The chosen operator will have to lend the rest of the financing.
Five companies qualified to bid as arena operators. In December 2011, Live Nation was selected as operator ahead of AEG Facilities.
