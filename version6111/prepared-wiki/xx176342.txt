[[Vaughan's identity]]

CATEGORIES: Analytic number theory

In mathematics, Vaughan's identity is an identity found by [tpl]harvs|txt=yes|authorlink=Robert Charles Vaughan (mathematician)|last=Vaughan|first=R. C. |year=1977[/tpl] that can be used to simplify  Vinogradov's work on trigonometric sums. It can be used to estimate sums of the form
where f is some function of positive integers n, whose values in applications are often roots of unity, and Λ is the von Mangoldt function.
Vaughan's identity has been used to simplify the proof of the Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem and to study Kummer sums.
Vaughan's identity was generalized by [tpl]harvtxt|Heath-Brown|1982[/tpl].
