[[Mercalli intensity scale]]

CATEGORIES: Seismic scales

The scale quantifies the effects of an earthquake on the Earth's surface, humans, objects of nature, and man-made structures on a scale from I (not felt) to XII (total destruction).[tpl]cite web|title=Magnitude / Intensity Comparison|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/mag_vs_int.php|publisher=USGS[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale|url=http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/eqmaps/doc/mmi.html|publisher=Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG)[/tpl] Values depend upon the distance to the earthquake, with the highest intensities being around the epicentral area. Data gathered from people who have experienced the quake are used to determine an intensity value for their location. The Mercalli (Intensity) scale originated with the widely used simple ten-degree Rossi-Forel scale which was revised by Italian volcanologist, Giuseppe Mercalli in 1884 and 1906.
In 1902 the ten-degree Mercalli scale was expanded to twelve degrees by Italian physicist Adolfo Cancani. It was later completely re-written by the German geophysicist August Heinrich Sieberg and became known as the Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg (MCS) scale.
The Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg scale was later modified and published in English by Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann in 1931 as the Mercalli-Wood-Neumann (MWN) scale. It was later improved by Charles Richter, the father of the Richter magnitude scale. 
The scale is known today as the Modified Mercalli scale (MM) or Modified Mercalli Intensity scale (MMI).

==Modified Mercalli Intensity scale==

The lower degrees of the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale generally deal with the manner in which the earthquake is felt by people. The higher numbers of the scale are based on observed structural damage.
The small table is a rough guide to the degrees of the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale. The colors and descriptive names shown here differ from those used on certain shake maps in other articles.
The large table gives Modified Mercalli scale intensities that are typically observed at locations near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The correlation between magnitude and intensity is far from total, depending upon several factors including the depth of the earthquake,  terrain, population density, and damage. For example, on May 19, 2011, an earthquake of magnitude 0.7 in Central California, United States 4 km deep was classified as of intensity III by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) over [tpl]convert|100|mi|km[/tpl] away from the epicenter (and II intensity almost [tpl]convert|300|mi|km[/tpl] from the epicenter), while a 4.5 magnitude quake in Salta, Argentina 164 km deep was of intensity I.USGS: Did you feel it? for 20 May 2011

===Correlation with physical quantities===

The Mercalli scale is not defined in terms of more rigorous, objectively quantifiable measurements such as shake amplitude, shake frequency, peak velocity, or peak acceleration. Human perceived shaking and building damages are best correlated with peak acceleration for lower-intensity events, and with peak velocity for higher-intensity events.[tpl]cite web|title=ShakeMap Scientific Background|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/shakemap/background.php|publisher=USGS[/tpl]

===Comparison to the moment magnitude scale===

The effects of any one earthquake can vary greatly from place to place, so there may be many Mercalli intensity values measured for the same earthquake. These values can be best displayed using a contoured map. Each earthquake, on the other hand, has only one magnitude.
