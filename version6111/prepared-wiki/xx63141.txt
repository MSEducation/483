==Early history==

The business was started by Harry Ramsden (1888–1963) in 1928 in a wooden hut in White Cross, Guiseley, West Yorkshire, northern England. Three years later he moved into a new premises, complete with fitted carpets, oak panelled walls and chandeliers. The original hut still stands on the same site adjacent to the main restaurant, which once held the Guinness World Record for the largest fish and chip shop in the world, seating 250 people, serving nearly a million customers a year. Harry Corbett of Sooty fame was a nephew of Harry Ramsden and played the piano in his uncle's original restaurant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dooyoo.co.uk/restaurants-cafes-national/harry-ramsdens-in-general/313856 |title=Harry Ramsdens in general – Review – WARNING – THIS IS GOING TO MAKE YOU FEEL SERIOUSLY HUNGRY! |publisher=Dooyoo.co.uk |accessdate=26 February 2010[/tpl]
In 1954 the business was sold to Harry Ramsden's long term business partner Eddie Stokes for [tpl]£|37,500[/tpl], subsequently selling in 1965 to Essex based Associated Fisheries.[tpl] cite book | title = Harry Ramsden the uncrowned king of fish and chips | isbn = 1-85568-088-2 [/tpl]

==Expansion==

In 1988, the company, which still comprised the original Guiseley fish and chips premises, was bought by Merryweathers, led by Chairmen John Barnes and Richard Richardson.http://www.marketingjudo.co.uk/about.php Barnes & Richardson led the transition of the business from a single restaurant in Yorkshire to a world famous brand.
In 1989, following a decision by their bank to withdraw funding, the management floated the company on the London Stock exchange. The public offer was over-subscribed by two and a half times. The next ten years saw rapid expansion throughout the UK and worldwide through company owned and franchised restaurants. Worldwide locations in Hong Kong, Australia, Epcot and Saudi Arabia added to the growing stature as an international brand.Marketing Judo ISBN 0-273-66316-X
A franchise deal with Granada motorway services to develop kiosk-style units ultimately led to Granada Ltd buying Harry Ramsden's for [tpl]£|20 million[/tpl] in October 1999. When acquired by Granada Harry Ramsden's comprised four company owned restaurants, twenty five franchises and sixteen Henry Higgins units. Granada expanded Harry Ramsden's into motorway locations. Some franchise territories infringed onto motorways so Granada bought the franchises back. In 2000 Compass merged with Granada. Under Compass, the business was expanded into motorway service station kiosks, contract catering locations such as schools, Post Office canteens, Little Chef, Butlins and Haven Holidays.

==SSP ownership and future==

By April 2006, Compass had spun off its motorway service stations to Moto bought by Macquarie Bank of Sydney, Australia. Its specialist airports and railways division SSP was sold for [tpl]£|1,822 million[/tpl] to EQT Partners of Sweden (who also own Findus). Harry Ramsden's was sold with the SSP business.
Under the early years of SSP ownership the business had to compete with other SSP brands for investment.
In 2008 SSP recruited industry turnaround specialist Chris Sullivan as Managing Director.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foodtravelexperts.com/newsarticle/57/press/malls-and-hunger-are-a-recipe-for-success/english |title=SSP – The Food Travel Experts |publisher=Foodtravelexperts.com |date=4 April 2009 |accessdate=26 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/weekend/Fantastic-feast-for-the-girls.5555537.jp |title=Fantastic feast for the girls – Blackpool Today |publisher=Blackpoolgazette.co.uk |accessdate=26 February 2010[/tpl] During 2009 Sullivan led a radical revision of the food on offer improving quality, reducing wait times and removing menu items which were more pub-restaurant than chip shop. The strategy delivered a marked improvement in sales in the food court and seaside restaurant business of Harry Ramsden's, prompting parent company SSP to market the business for sale.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]
On 19 January 2010 SSP sold Harry Ramsden's to Boparan Ventures Limited.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foodtravelexperts.com/newsarticle/74/latestnews/the-sale-of-harry-ramsden's |title=SSP – The Food Travel Experts |publisher=Foodtravelexperts.com |date=15 November 2007 |accessdate=26 February 2010[/tpl] BVL is the private investment vehicle of Ranjit Boparan.

==Undercover Boss==

In 2010, the chain was the focus of an episode of the Channel 4 television series Undercover Boss. The then-CEO of the company, Marija Simovic, posed as a new starter in a variety of locations – Swindon, Merry Hill Shopping Centre, Blackpool, Southampton and Great Yarmouth – to try to understand why the company was struggling in today's market. At the end of the programme, Simovic promised big changes in a bid to turn around the company's fortunes, along with promoting a number of employees who had impressed her.

==Licensing==

Under the name of the brand, Premier Foods sell mushy peas (since April 2006), and Young's Bluecrest (owned by Heinz since October 1999) sell frozen fish and oven chips.
