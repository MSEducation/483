[[Femtosecond]]

CATEGORIES: Orders of magnitude (time)

A femtosecond is the SI unit of time equal to 10−15 of a second.  That is one quadrillionth, or one millionth of one billionth, of a second.[tpl]cite web |title = Merriam Webster Online Dictionary |url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/femtosecond |title = Femtosecond: Merriam Webster definition [/tpl] For context, a femtosecond is to a second as a second is to about 31.7 million years; a ray of light travels approximately 0.3 µm (micrometers) in 1 femtosecond, a distance comparable to the diameter of a virus.Compared with overview in: [tpl]cite book |author=Fisher, Bruce; Harvey, Richard P.; Champe, Pamela C. |title=Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Microbiology (Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=0-7817-8215-5 |oclc= |doi=[/tpl] Page 3
The word femtosecond is formed by the SI prefix femto and the SI unit second. Its symbol is fs.[tpl]cite web |title = NIST Definitions of the SI units |url = http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/prefixes.html |author = NIST [/tpl]
A femtosecond is equal to 1000 attoseconds, or 1/1000 picosecond.  Because the next higher SI unit is 1000 times larger, times of 10−14 and 10−13 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of femtoseconds.
