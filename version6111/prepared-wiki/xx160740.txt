</ref>  In a 1982 article in the [[academic journal|journal]] ''Theory & Society'', [[Lewis & Clark College]] [[sociology]] professor Robert Goldman compared and contrasted Letterman's "Ellsworth" character and his training program to that of Werner Erhard.  Goldman noted that the episode spent time: "lampooning Werner Erhard and ''est''-like commercial pop psychologies."  However, Goldman went on to note that the inherent problem with "Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning" was not the training - but Ellsworth himself.  Ellsworth is seen not just as a parody of Werner Erhard, but also of [[consumerism]]: "As the self-help entrepreneur, Ellsworth is portrayed as a walking collection of lifestyle-status points and sign-values ("I've got my Rolls-Royce!"). Conspicuous consumption and commodity fetishism define his personality."  Goldman explained that the ''Mork and Mindy'' episode succeeded in distinguishing between criticism of the Ellsworth training, and criticism of Ellsworth, citing Ellsworth's character traits of: "tyranny, selfishness, open greed, and flaunting of the accoutrements of his vulgar money-making."  In the end of the segment of the episode parodying est, [[Mork & Mindy|Mork]] wins out over the Ellsworth philosophy by instead calling to mind universal [[Humanism|humanistic]] moral values.<ref name="goldman" />  David Letterman received positive praise for his portrayal of "Ellsworth" in the episode.<ref name="amg">[tpl]cite news  | last = Tobey  | first = Matthew |  title = Mork & Mindy: Mork Goes Erk | work = [[Allmovie]]  |   publisher = All Media Guide, LLC. | url =http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:314015 | accessdate =  2007-10-29[/tpl]</ref><ref>[tpl]cite news | last =Liebenson  | first =Donald |  title = Mork & Mindy - The Complete First Season (1978): Amazon.com essential video | work = [[Amazon.com]] | pages =Editorial Reviews |  publisher = Amazon.com, Inc. | year = 2004 | url = http://www.amazon.com/Mork-Mindy-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0002I837M| accessdate = 2007-10-29 [/tpl]</ref><ref>[tpl]cite news | last =Staff  |   title = Mork & Mindy | work = [[Dallas Morning News]] |    date =November 5, 2004 [/tpl]</ref>

===Six Feet Under===

Six Feet Under Episode 16, of Season 2, "The Plan", featured a seminar-delivery organization called "The Plan", which the character Claire Fisher immediately compared to est.  Actress Alice Krige portrays "Alma" the seminar leader of "The Plan" - who uses jargon related to the "blueprint" for building a house in order to convey concepts about self-improvement.  She singles out the character Ruth and berates her for "tiptoeing around her own house like she's afraid of waking someone up."  Ruth begins to use jargon from the course in her conversations with family, and complains to her daughter that she cannot yet go to sleep after coming home from her seminar because she must first do "homework" from the course. This homework includes writing a letter to her dead mother forgiving her for "all the terrible things she did to me", and writing a letter to herself, describing how she will "renovate" her life.  During the following day of "The Plan", the seminar leader gives the group a new assignment: to go outside to ready banks of phones, and call their family members to inform them of specifically how they wish to "renovate their homes" together.  In the seminar, the leader asks everyone to close their eyes and imagine that everyone else is laughing at them for being stupid, and then asks the participants if they get the joke. Everyone does, except Ruth, who rants at the course instructor. After her rant, the leader congratulates her for "knocking down her old house", and proceeds to tell her that now she can rebuild a new house.[tpl]cite news | last = Staff |  coauthors = Television Without Pity | title = Six Feet Under, The Plan, Recap | work = Yahoo!

Analysis in secondary sources and books on Six Feet Under have compared the training in "The Plan" to the current incarnation of Erhard's trainings, Landmark Education.[tpl]cite news  | last = Venkatasubban   | first = Sharmila  |  title = Article of Faith | work = Pittsburgh City Paper |    date = January 1, 2003 [/tpl]  Reading Six Feet Under: TV to Die For by Akass et al. have compared "The Plan" to est and The Forum.[tpl]cite book | last = Akass | first = Kim |  coauthors = Janet McCabe, Mark Lawson | title = Reading Six Feet Under: TV to Die For | publisher = I.B.Tauris | year = 2005 |  pages = 96–97 |   isbn =  1-85043-809-9[/tpl]  Akass cites the episode while analyzing the phenomenon of self-improvement, and notes that: "Repairing her shingles often leaves Ruth in shackles."  She writes that: ".the series performs the logic of self-help, both its silly and seductive sides."  However, she also points out that Ruth's rant at the end of her seminar is cathartic for Ruth, and she ends her analysis of the episode by asking: "So, what do we make of our times when all this supposed nonsense actually works?"

==Theatre==

In February 1995, the Broom Street Theater in Madison, Wisconsin produced a play entitled: Devil In Paradise, The Fall and Rise of Werner Erhard.[tpl]cite web | last = Gersmann  | first = Joel  | title = Devil In Paradise, The Fall and Rise of Werner Erhard  | work = Broom Street Theatre | publisher = www.broomstreet.org | url = http://www.broomstreet.org/archives/1995-02.html | accessdate = 2007-10-24[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  The play was written and directed by Joel Gersmann, and performed with a cast of seven actors.  The play was described as "a fascinating character study of the man who founded the wildly successful "human potential movement," as well as the many people who bought into it."  The work was a satire of Erhard, which fictionalized his early life, but the piece was criticized for its lack of structure.  Short scenes and blackouts were described as confusing.
The production was reviewed in The Capital Times in March 1995, and the staff of The Capital Times was later contacted by representatives of Werner Erhard, and asked to issue a correction regarding statements made in the review.[tpl]cite news  | last = Chase  | first = Michael   | title = 'Devil' A Fascinating Portrait  | work = The Capital Times  | publisher = Capital Newspapers  | date = March 7, 1995  | url = http://www.broomstreet.org/reviews/devil.html  | accessdate =  2007-10-24[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  The paper later issued a correction, which emphasized that the play was indeed a fictionalized account.
In 2008, Climate Theater in San Francisco, California showed a play called The Group, written by Robert Quillen Camp and performed by Ryan Eggensperger.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.climatetheater.com/|title=The Group|work=Climate Theater|publisher=www.climatetheater.com|accessdate=2008-06-09[/tpl] Climate Theater described the play as "Inspired by the largely American tradition of packaging and selling self-empowerment, from EST and the Landmark Forum to Norman Vincent Peale and The Secret". The play's performance ensemble cite "EST and the Landmark Forum" among inspirations for the parody.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dodeska.com/groupabout.htm|title=THE GROUP May 29 - June 14, 2008|work=Dodeska Performance Ensemble|publisher=www.dodeska.com|accessdate=2008-06-09|date=May 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080605003838/http://www.dodeska.com/groupabout.htm |archivedate = June 5, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The play is an immersive performance piece, and Robert Quillen Camp explained: "Our aim is to create a fun but ultimate unsettling experience reflecting simultaneous attraction to and repulsion from organizations that promise a better and happier life."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beyondchron.org/news/index.php?itemid=5722|title=Have a Little est - Have a Little Norman Vincent Peale or Learn The Secret|work=BeyondChron: San Francisco's Alternative Online Daily News|publisher=www.beyondchron.org|accessdate=2008-06-09|date=May 30, 2008|last=Buzzin' Lee Hartgrave[/tpl] Audience members sit in a circle and wear audio headsets, through which they listen to the charismatic leader's voice and sound effects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=theatre&article=399|title=Summer stage attractions|work=Bay Area Reporter|date=May 29, 2008|publisher=www.ebar.com|accessdate=2008-06-09|last=Dodds|first=Richard[/tpl] The production ran from May 29, 2008 to June 14, 2008.
Robert Avila of the San Francisco Bay Guardian called The Group: "in-your-face comedy in a droll send-up of EST-like self-actualization programs," and a spoof of "recent incarnations" including The Secret and Landmark Forum. Avila gave the play a positive review, noting its "inspired writing, sharp humor, and simple yet slick production". In a review of the play for the San Jose Mercury News, Karen D'Souza wrote:  From est to 'The Secret,' this is a playful lampoon of 'healing philosophies'".[tpl]cite web|url=http://origin.mercurynews.com/arts/ci_9429936|title='The Group,' a witty parody of self-help therapy Ryan Eggensperger is cheesily charismatic as leader in memorable world premiere from Robert Quillen Camp|work=San Jose Mercury News|publisher=origin.mercurynews.com|accessdate=2008-06-09|date=May 30, 2008|last=D'Souza|first=Karen[/tpl] D'Souza also reviewed the play positively, writing: " Writer-director Robert Quillen Camp slyly pokes fun at reducing the human experience to one-size-fits-all platitudes and besmirching belief systems with "cash-only" workshops." Pat Craig wrote in Contra Costa Times: "After a lifetime of enduring various human potential programs, from the chanted mantras of transcendental meditation to the institutionalized loathing of est, 'The Group' seems a bit tame for satire to a veteran of the high-profit mind games." In a review for the San Francisco Examiner, Leslie Katz described The Group as "one of those parodies that's so good, you almost don't know it's a fake," and commented: "In the end, the show provides excellent therapy. As those who aren't swayed by expensive self-help seminars know, laughter is indeed the best medicine."[tpl]cite web|title=Review: When positive thinking goes awry|work=San Francisco Examiner|publisher=www.examiner.com|date=May 30, 2008|last=Katz|first=Leslie[/tpl]
