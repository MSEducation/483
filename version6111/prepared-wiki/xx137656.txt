[[Freedom of religion in the United States]]

CATEGORIES: Religion in the United States, Freedom of religion by country, Freedom of expression in the United States

In the United States, freedom of religion is a constitutionally guaranteed right provided in the religion clauses of the First Amendment. Freedom of religion is also closely associated with separation of church and state, a concept advocated by Thomas Jefferson.

==Legal and public foundation==

The United States Constitution addresses the issue of religion in two places: in the First Amendment, and the Article VI prohibition on religious tests as a condition for holding public office. The First Amendment prohibits the federal government from making a law "respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof".  This provision was later expanded to state and local governments, through the Incorporation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

===Colonial precedents===

Freedom of religion was first applied as a principle in the founding of the colony of Maryland, also  founded by the Catholic Lord Baltimore, in 1634.Zimmerman, Mark, Symbol of Enduring Freedom, p. 19, Columbia Magazine, March 2010 Fifteen years  later (1649), the first enactment of religious liberty, the Maryland Toleration Act, drafted by Lord Baltimore, provided: "No person or persons...shall from henceforth be any waies troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof."  The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed.Brugger, Robert J. (1988). Maryland: A Middle Temperament. , p 21, Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press. ISBN 0-8018-3399-X.  In 1657, Lord Baltimore regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1658 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692,Finkelman, Paul, Maryland Toleration Act, The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties, New York: CRC Press. ISBN 0-415-94342-6. when after Maryland's Protestant Revolution of 1689, freedom of religion was again rescinded.Roark, Elisabeth Louise, p.78, Artists of colonial America Retrieved February 22, 2010  In addition  in 1704, an Act was passed "to prevent the growth of Popery in this Province", preventing Catholics from holding political office. Full religious toleration would not be restored in Maryland until the American Revolution, when Maryland's Charles Carroll of Carrollton signed the American Declaration of Independence.
Rhode Island (1636), Connecticut (1636), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (1682), founded by Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, combined religious freedom with the democratic form of government that Separatist Congregationalists (Pilgrim Fathers) and Puritans had developed in Plymouth Colony (1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628).Allan Weinstein and David Rubel (2002), The Story of America: Freedom and Crisis from Settlement to Superpower, DK Publishing, Inc., New York, N.Y., ISBN 0-7894-8903-1, pp. 58-63Christopher Fennell (1998), Plymouth Colony Legal Structure (http://www.histarch.uiuc.edu/plymouth/ccflaw.html)Hanover Historical Texts Project (http://history.hanover.edu/texts/masslib.html)M.

Williams gave the most profound theological reason: As faith is the free gift of the Holy Spirit, it cannot be forced upon a person. Therefore strict separation of church and state has to be kept.Heinrich Bornkamm, Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums, in Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 943 Pennsylvania was the only colony that retained unlimited religious freedom until the foundation of the United States. The inseparable connection of democracy, freedom of religion, and the other forms of freedom became the political and legal basis of the new nation. In particular, Baptists and Presbyterians demanded vigorously and successfully the disestablishment of the Anglican and Congregational state churches that had existed in most colonies since the seventeenth century.Robert Middlekauff (2005), The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0-19-516247-9, p. 635

===The First Amendment===

In the United States, the religious civil liberties are guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution:
The "Establishment Clause," stating that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion," is generally read to prohibit the Federal government from establishing a national church ("religion") or excessively involving itself in religion, particularly to the benefit of one religion over another. Following the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and through the doctrine of incorporation, this restriction is held to be applicable to state governments as well.
The "Free Exercise Clause" states that Congress cannot "prohibit the free exercise" of religious practices. The Supreme Court of the United States has consistently held, however, that the right to free exercise of religion is not absolute. For example, in the 19th century, some of the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints traditionally practiced polygamy, yet in Reynolds v. United States (1879), the Supreme Court upheld the criminal conviction of one of these members under a federal law banning polygamy. The Court reasoned that to do otherwise would set precedent for a full range of religious beliefs including those as extreme as human sacrifice. The Court stated that "Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with practices." For example, if one were part of a religion that believed in vampirism, the First Amendment would protect one's belief in vampirism, but not the practice. This principle has similarly been applied to those attempting to claim religious exemptions for smoking cannabisS. v. Kuch 288 FSup. 439 (1968) ("Those who seek constitutional protections for their participation in an establishment of religion and freedom to practice its beliefs must not be permitted the special freedoms that this special sanctuary may provide merely by adopting religious nomenclature and cynically using it as a shield to protect them when participating in anti-social conduct that otherwise stands condemned."),[tpl]Failed verification|date=April 2007[/tpl] or, as in the case of Employment Division v. Smith (1990), the use of the hallucinogen peyote. Currently, peyote and ayahuasca are allowed by legal precedent if used in a religious ceremony; though cannabis is not.

===The Fourteenth Amendment===

The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the religious civil rights.For the distinction between religious civil liberties and religious civil rights, see e.g.: Religious discrimination. A neglected issue. A consultation sponsored by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Washington D.C., April 9–11, 1979. Preface Whereas the First Amendment secures the free exercise of religion, section one of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination, including on the basis of religion, by securing "the equal protection of the laws" for every person:

===Religious tests===

The affirmation or denial of specific religious beliefs had, in the past, been made into qualifications for public office; however, the United States Constitution states that the inauguration of a President may include an "affirmation" of the faithful execution of his duties rather than an "oath" to that effect — this provision was included in order to respect the religious prerogatives of the Quakers, a Protestant Christian denomination that declines the swearing of oaths. The U.S. Constitution also provides that "No religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification of any Office or public Trust under the United States."
Several states have language included in their constitutions that requires state office-holders to have particular religious beliefs. These include Arkansas,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/texas2.htm|title=Quotation, Overview, and the Constitutions of Arkansas & Maryland|publisher=Ontario consultants on religious tolerance|accessdate=2012-12-03[/tpl] Maryland, Massachusetts,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/texas3.htm|title=Religious discrimination in state constitutions : Constitutions of Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee & Texas|publisher=Ontario consultants on religious tolerance|accessdate=2012-12-03[/tpl] North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.For instance in Texas an official may be "excluded from holding office" if he/she does not "acknowledge the existence of a Supreme Being." (i.e. God)Texas Legislature Online Some of these beliefs (or oaths) were historically required of jurors and witnesses in court. Even though they are still on the books, these provisions have been rendered unenforceable by U.S. Supreme Court decisions.
With reference to the use of animals, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of the Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah in 1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual animal sacrifice with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision, “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection”.

City of Euless. The court ruled that the free exercise of religion was meritorious and prevailing and that Merced was entitled under the Texas Religious Freedom and Restoration Act (TRFRA) to an injunction preventing the city of Euless, Texas from enforcing its ordinances that burdened his religious practices relating to the use of animals.Merced, President Templo Yoruba Omo Orisha Texas, Inc., v. City of Euless http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1479305.html". Full text of the opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.
Religious liberty has not prohibited states or the federal government from prohibiting or regulating certain behaviors; i.e. prostitution, gambling, alcohol and certain drugs, although some libertarians interpret religious freedom to extend to these behaviors. However, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that a right to privacy or a due process right does prevent the government from prohibiting adult access to birth control, pornography, and from outlawing sodomy between consenting adults and early trimester abortions.

===The "wall of separation"===

Thomas Jefferson wrote that the First Amendment erected a "wall of separation between church and state" likely borrowing the language from Roger Williams, founder of the First Baptist Church in America and the Colony of Rhode Island, who used the phrase in his 1644 book, The Bloody Tenent of Persecution.Feldman, Noah (2005). Divided by God. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 24 James Madison, often regarded as the "Father of the Bill of Rights",Wood, 2006b. also often wrote of the "perfect separation",Letter to Edward Livingston, July 10, 1822 "line of separation",letter to Rev Jasper Adams spring 1832 "strongly guarded as is the separation between religion and government in the Constitution of the United States",Detached Memoranda, 1820 and "total separation of the church from the state".letter to Robert Walsh, March 2, 1819 Controversy rages in the United States between those who wish to restrict government involvement with religious institutions and remove religious references from government institutions and property, and those who wish to loosen such prohibitions.  Advocates for stronger separation of church and state emphasize the plurality of faiths and non-faiths in the country, and what they see as broad guarantees of the federal Constitution. Their opponents emphasize what they see as the largely Christian heritage and history of the nation (often citing the references to "Nature's God" and the "Creator" of men in the Declaration of Independence). Some more socially conservative Christian sects, such as the Christian Reconstructionist movement, oppose the concept of a "wall of separation" and prefer a closer relationship between church and state.
Problems also arise in U.S. public schools concerning the teaching and display of religious issues. In various counties, school choice and school vouchers have been put forward as solutions to accommodate variety in beliefs and freedom of religion, by allowing individual school boards to choose between a secular, religious or multi-faith vocation, and allowing parents free choice among these schools. Critics of American voucher programs claim that they take funds away from public schools, and that the amount of funds given by vouchers is not enough to help many middle and working class parents.
U.S. judges often ordered alcoholic defendants to attend Alcoholics Anonymous or face imprisonment. However, in 1999, a federal appeals court ruled this unconstitutional because the A.A. program relies on submission to a "Higher Power".[tpl]cite court|litigants=Warner v.

Thomas Jefferson also played a large role in the formation of freedom of religion.  He created the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which has since been incorporated into the Virginia State Constitution.

===Other statements===

====Unalienable rights====

The United States of America was established on foundational principles by the Declaration of Independence:
 We hold these truths to be self-evident:
 That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; (based on Thomas Jefferson's draft.)

====Religious institutions====

In 1944, a joint committee of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America and the Foreign Missions Conference formulated a “Statement on Religious Liberty”

====Freedom of religion restoration====

Following increasing government involvement in religious matters, Congress passed the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
A number of states then passed corresponding acts (e.g., Missouri passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act).

====Treaty of Tripoli====

Signed on November 4, 1796, the Treaty of Tripoli was a document that included the following statement:

This treaty was submitted to the Senate and was ratified unanimously on June 7, 1797, and then signed by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  In accordance with Article VI of the Constitution, on that date this treaty became incorporated as part of "the supreme Law of the Land".

==Supreme Court rulings==

===Jehovah's Witnesses===

Since the 1940s, the Jehovah's Witnesses have often invoked the First Amendment's freedom of religion clauses to protect their ability to engage in the proselytizing (or preaching) that is central to their faith.  This series of litigation has helped to define civil liberties case law in the United States and Canada.
In the United States of America and several other countries, the legal struggles of the Jehovah's Witnesses have yielded some of the most important judicial decisions regarding freedom of religion, press and speech.  In the United States, many Supreme Court cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses are now landmark decisions of First Amendment law.  Of the 72 cases involving the Jehovah's Witnesses that have been brought before the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court has ruled in favor of them 47 times.  Even the cases that the Jehovah's Witnesses lost helped the U.S. to more clearly define the limits of First Amendment rights.  Former Supreme Court Justice Harlan Stone jokingly suggested "The Jehovah's Witnesses ought to have an endowment in view of the aid which they give in solving the legal problems of civil liberties."  "Like it or not," observed American author and editor Irving Dilliard, "Jehovah's Witnesses have done more to help preserve our freedoms than any other religious group."
Professor C. S. Braden wrote: "They have performed a signal service to democracy by their fight to preserve their civil rights, for in their struggle they have done much to secure those rights for every minority group in America."[tpl]cite book |title=These Also Believe |first=C.S. |last=Braden |isbn=0-02-514360-3[/tpl]
"The cases that the Witnesses were involved in formed the bedrock of 1st Amendment protections for all citizens," said Paul Polidoro, a lawyer who argued the Watchtower Society's case before the Supreme Court in February 2002.  "These cases were a good vehicle for the courts to address the protections that were to be accorded free speech, the free press and free exercise of religion.  In addition, the cases marked the emergence of individual rights as an issue within the U.S. court system.
Before the Jehovah’s Witnesses brought several dozen cases before the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1930s and 1940s, the Court had handled few cases contesting laws that restricted freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Until then, the First Amendment had only been applied to Congress and the federal government.
However, the cases brought before the Court by the Jehovah's Witnesses allowed the Court to consider a range of issues: mandatory flag salute, sedition, free speech, literature distribution and military draft law. These cases proved to be pivotal moments in the formation of constitutional law.  Jehovah’s Witnesses’ court victories have strengthened rights including the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference, the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service and the right to engage in public discourse.
During the World War II era, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Jehovah's Witnesses in several landmark cases that helped pave the way for the modern civil rights movement.  In all, Jehovah's Witnesses brought 23 separate First Amendment actions before the U.S. Supreme Court between 1938 and 1946.

===Lemon test===

The Supreme Court has consistently held fast to the rule of strict separation of church and state when matters of prayer are involved.
In Engel v. Vitale (1962) the Court ruled that government-imposed nondenominational prayer in public school was unconstitutional. In Lee v. Weisman (1992), the Court ruled prayer established by a school principal at a middle school graduation was also unconstitutional, and in Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe (2000) it ruled that school officials may not directly impose student-led prayer during high school football games nor establish an official student election process for the purpose of indirectly establishing such prayer. The distinction between force of government and individual liberty is the cornerstone of such cases. Each case restricts acts by government designed to establish prayer while explicitly or implicitly affirming students' individual freedom to pray.
The Court has therefore tried to determine a way to deal with church/state questions.  In Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), the Court created a three-part test for laws dealing with religious establishment.  This determined that a law was constitutional if it:
However, since the 1980s, the Supreme Court has seemed to sidestep the Lemon test altogether.

==State constitutions==

Under the doctrine of Incorporation, the first amendment has been made applicable to the states.  Therefore the states must guarantee the freedom of religion in the same way the federal government must.
Many states have freedom of religion established in their constitution, though the exact legal consequences of this right vary for historical and cultural reasons. Most states interpret "freedom of religion" as including the freedom of long-established religious communities to remain intact and not be destroyed. By extension, democracies interpret "freedom of religion" as the right of each individual to freely choose to convert from one religion to another, mix religions, or abandon religion altogether.

===Requirements for holding a public office===

The no religious test clause of the U.S. constitution states that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." Although it has become tradition for US presidents to end their Presidential Oath with "so help me God", this is not required by the Constitution. However, the Vice President, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the members of the Cabinet, and all other civil and military officers and federal employees other than the President are required to take an oath ending with "so help me God."[ref][tpl]usc|5|3331[/tpl], Oath of Office;

===Issues at the workplace===

Problems sometimes arise in the workplace concerning religious observance when a private employer discharges an employee for failure to report to work on what the employee considers a holy day or a day of rest. In the United States, the view that has generally prevailed is that firing for any cause in general renders a former employee ineligible for unemployment compensation, but that this is no longer the case if the 'cause' is religious in nature, especially an employee's unwillingness to work during Jewish Shabbat, Christian Sabbath, or Muslim jumu'ah.

Two types of anti-Catholic rhetoric existed in colonial society. The first, derived from the heritage of the Protestant Reformation and the religious wars of the 16th century, consisted of the "Anti-Christ" and the "Whore of Babylon" variety and dominated Anti-Catholic thought until the late 17th century. The second was a more secular variety which focused on the supposed intrigue of the Catholics intent on extending medieval despotism worldwide.[tpl]cite book |last=Mannard |first=Joseph G. |title=American Anti-Catholicism and its Literature |year=1981 |url=http://www.geocities.com/chiniquy/Literature.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5knIMqNnD|archivedate=2009-10-25|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Historian Arthur Schlesinger Sr. has called Anti-Catholicism "the deepest-held bias in the history of the American people.""The Coming Catholic Church". By David Gibson. HarperCollins: Published 2004.
Because many of the British colonists, such as the Puritans and Congregationalists, were fleeing religious persecution by the Church of England, much of early American religious culture exhibited the more extreme anti-Catholic bias of these Protestant denominations. Monsignor John Tracy Ellis wrote that a "universal anti-Catholic bias was brought to Jamestown in 1607 and vigorously cultivated in all the thirteen colonies from Massachusetts to Georgia."[tpl]harvnb|Ellis|1956|American Catholicism[/tpl] Colonial charters and laws contained specific proscriptions against Roman Catholics. Monsignor Ellis noted that a common hatred of the Roman Catholic Church could unite Anglican clerics and Puritan ministers despite their differences and conflicts.
Some of America's Founding Fathers held anti-clerical beliefs.  For example, in 1788, John Jay urged the New York Legislature to require office-holders to renounce foreign authorities "in all matters ecclesiastical as well as civil.".Annotation  Thomas Jefferson wrote: "History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government,"Letter to Alexander von Humboldt, December 6, 1813 and, "In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot, abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own."Letter to Horatio G. Spafford, March 17, 1814

Anti-Catholic animus in the United States reached a peak in the 19th century when the Protestant population became alarmed by the influx of Catholic immigrants.

The founder of the Know-Nothing movement, Lewis C. Levin, based his political career entirely on anti-Catholicism, and served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives (1845–1851), after which he campaigned for Fillmore and other "nativist" candidates.

Anti-Catholicism was widespread in the 1920s; anti-Catholics, including the Ku Klux Klan, believed that Catholicism was incompatible with democracy and that parochial schools encouraged separatism and kept Catholics from becoming loyal Americans. The Catholics responded to such prejudices by repeatedly asserting their rights as American citizens and by arguing that they, not the nativists (anti-Catholics), were true patriots since they believed in the right to freedom of religion.Dumenil (1991)
The 1928 presidential campaign of Al Smith was a rallying point for the Klan and the tide of anti-Catholicism in the U.S.  The Catholic Church of the Little Flower was first built in 1925 in Royal Oak, Michigan, a largely Protestant area.  Two weeks after it opened, the Ku Klux Klan burned a cross in front of the church.     The church burned down in a fire in 1936.[tpl]cite book |last1= Hutting |first1= Albert M.|authorlink1= |title= Shrine of the Little Flower |url= |format= |edition= |year= 1998 |origyear= 1936 |publisher= Radio League of the Little Flower |location= Royal Oak, MI |isbn= |oclc= 32783964|page= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl]  In response, the church built a fireproof crucifixion tower, as a "cross they could not burn".[ref][tpl]cite news |title= Royal Oak Journal; Bitter Memories of Anti-Semitism Live On in Michigan Parish |first= Doron P. |last= Levin |authorlink= |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/25/us/royal-oak-journal-bitter-memories-of-anti-semitism-live-on-in-michigan-parish.html|agency= |newspaper= New York Times |date= 25 May 1992|quote= [/tpl]

In 1922, the voters of Oregon passed an initiative amending Oregon Law Section 5259, the Compulsory Education Act.  The law unofficially became known as the Oregon School Law.  The citizens' initiative was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools, including Catholic schools.Howard, J. Paul. "Cross-Border Reflections, Parents’ Right to Direct Their Childrens’ Education Under the U.S. and Canadian Constitutions", Education Canada, v41 n2 p36-37 Sum 2001.  The law caused outraged Catholics to organize locally and nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools.  In Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925), the United States Supreme Court declared the Oregon's Compulsory Education Act unconstitutional in a ruling that that has been called "the Magna Carta of the parochial school system."
In 1928, Al Smith became the first Roman Catholic to gain a major party's nomination for President, and his religion became an issue during the campaign.  Many Protestants feared that Smith would take orders from church leaders in Rome in making decisions affecting the country.
A key factor that hurt John F. Kennedy in his 1960 campaign for the presidency of the United States was the widespread prejudice against his Roman Catholic religion; some Protestants, including Norman Vincent Peale, believed that, if he were elected President, Kennedy would have to take orders from the Pope in Rome.The first modern campaign: Kennedy, Nixon, and the election of 1960, Gary Donaldson, p.107  To address fears that his Roman Catholicism would impact his decision-making, John F. Kennedy famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960, "I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters — and the Church does not speak for me."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html|title=Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association|accessdate=2007-09-17|last=Kennedy|first=John F.|date=2002-06-18|work=American Rhetoric[/tpl] He promised to respect the separation of church and state and not to allow Catholic officials to dictate public policy to him.  Kennedy also raised the question of whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Catholic.
Kennedy went on to win the national popular vote over Richard Nixon by just one tenth of one percentage point (0.1%) – the closest popular-vote margin of the 20th century. In the electoral college, Kennedy's victory was larger, as he took 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).  The New York Times, summarizing the discussion late in November, spoke of a “narrow consensus” among the experts that Kennedy had won more than he lost as a result of his Catholicism,New York Times, November 20, 1960, Section 4, p. E5 as Catholics flocked to Kennedy to demonstrate  their group solidarity in demanding political equality.
In 2011, The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops argued that the Obama Administration put an undue burden upon Catholics and forced them to violate their right to freedom of religion as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

===Situations of the Latter Day Saint movement 1820–90===

Historically, the Latter Day Saint movement, which is often called Mormonism, has been the victim of religious violence beginning with reports by founder Joseph Smith immediately after his First Vision 1820Joseph Smith – History 1:20–25 and continuing as the movement grew and migrated from its inception in western New York to Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois. The violence culminated when Smith was assassinated by a mob of 200 men in Carthage Jail in 1844. Joseph Smith had surrendered himself previously to the authorities, who failed to protect him. As a result of the violence they were faced with in the East, the Mormon pioneers, led by Brigham Young, migrated westwards and eventually founded Salt Lake City, and many other communities along the Mormon Corridor.
Smith and his followers experienced relatively low levels of persecution in New York and Ohio,The historian Fawn M. Brodie (No Man Knows My History, 119) speculated that one of John Johnson's sons, Eli, meant to punish Smith by having him castrated for an intimacy with his sister, Nancy Marinda Johnson. However, historian Richard Lyman Bushman states that this hypothesis failed, partly because Eli was John Johnson's brother, not his son. Bushman feels a more probable motivation is recorded by Symonds Ryder, a participant in the event, who felt Smith was plotting to take property from members of the community and a company of citizens violently warned Smith that they would not accept those actions.[tpl]Clarify|date=February 2009[/tpl] although one incident involved church members being tarred and feathered.[tpl]Cite book |last1= Smith |first1= Joseph |last2= Smith |first2= Joseph Jr |last3= Roberts |first3= B.

They would eventually move on to Missouri, where some of the worst atrocities against Mormons would take place. Smith declared the area around Independence, Missouri to be the site of Zion, inspiring a massive influx of Mormon converts. Locals, alarmed by rumors of the strange, new religion (including rumors of polygamy),[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl] attempted to drive the Mormons out. This resulted in the 1838 Mormon War, the Haun's Mill massacre, and the issue of the Missouri Executive Order 44 by Governor Lilburn Boggs, which ordered "... Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the state ...".[tpl]Cite book |url= http://www.unco.edu/Drshaff/Hist330Spr2001/extermorder.htm |title= Governor Boggs' order of extermination |publisher= University of Northern Colorado |date= October 27, 1838 |accessdate= 2008-12-01 [/tpl]   [tpl]Cite book |last= Bagley |first= Will |title= Blood of the Prophets |publisher= University of Oklahoma Press |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-8061-3639-1 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=eakce2R_mdkC |pages= 11–12 [/tpl] The majority of Mormons would flee to Illinois, where they were received warmly by the village of Commerce, Illinois. The Mormons quickly expanded the town and renamed it Nauvoo, which was one of the largest cities in Illinois at the time.[tpl]cite book |last= Arrington |first= Leonard J |authorlink= Leonard J.

The economic, political, and religious dominance of the Mormons (Smith was mayor of the city and commander of the local militia, the Nauvoo Legion) inspired mobs to attack the city, and Smith was arrested for ordering the destruction of an anti-Mormon newspaper, the Nauvoo Expositor, although he acted with the consent of the city council.[tpl]cite web |title= The Destruction of the "Nauvoo Expositor"—Proceedings of the Nauvoo City Council and Mayor |url= http://byustudies2.byu.edu/hc/6/22.html |publisher= BYU [/tpl] He was imprisoned, along with his brother Hyrum Smith, at Carthage Jail, where they were both attacked and murdered.
After a succession crisis, most of the Mormons united under Brigham Young, who organized an evacuation from Nauvoo and from the United States itself after the federal government refused to protect the Mormons.[tpl]cite journal |last= Smith |first= Joseph Fielding |authorlink= Joseph Fielding Smith |title= Church History and Modern Revelation |volume= 4 |pages= 167–173 |publisher= Deseret Book |date= 1946–1949 [/tpl] Young and an eventual 50,000–70,000 would cross the Great Plains to settle in the Salt Lake Valley and the surrounding area. After the events of the Mexican-American War, the area became a United States territory. Young immediately petitioned for the addition of the State of Deseret, but the federal government declined. Instead, Congress carved out the much smaller territory of Utah. Over the next 46 years, several actions of the federal government were directed at Mormons, specifically to curtail the practice of polygamy and to reduce their political and economic power. These included the Utah War, Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, Poland Act, Edmunds Act, and Edmunds-Tucker Act. In 1890, LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto, ending polygamy.
With the concept of plural marriage, from 1830 to 1890 the Mormon faith allowed its members to practice polygamy; after 1843 this was limited to polygyny (one man could have several wives). The notion of polygamy was not only generally disdained by most of Joseph Smith's contemporaries,In 1854 the Republican party referred to polygamy in its platform as one of the "twin relics of barbarism" (in addition to slavery). see: History of civil marriage in the U.S. it is also contrary to the traditional Christian understanding of marriage. After 1844 the United States government passed legislation aimed specifically at the Mormon practice of polygamy until The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) officially renounced it. In the case of Reynolds v. United States, the U.S. supreme court concluded that "religious duty" was not a suitable defense to an indictment for polygamy; therefore, a law against polygamy is not legally considered to discriminate against a religion that endorses polygamy. When their appeals to the courts and lawmakers were exhausted and once church leaders were satisfied that God had accepted what they saw as their sacrifice for the principle, the prophet leader of the church announced that he had received inspiration that God had accepted their obedience and rescinded the commandment for plural marriage. In 1890, an official declaration was issued by the church prohibiting further plural marriages.[tpl]Cite book |last1= Wardle |first1= Lynn D |last2= Nolan |first2= Laurence C. |title= Fundamental Principles of Family Law |publisher= Wm.

===Situation of Native Americans===

The situation of Native Americans in the United States has been problematic since the initial European colonization of the Americas. Aside from the general issues in the relations between Europeans and Native Americans, there has been a historic suppression of Native American religions as well as some current charges of religious discrimination against Native Americans by the U.S. government, that need to be considered.
With the practice of the Americanization of Native Americans, Native American children were sent to Christian boarding schools where they were forced to worship as Christians and traditional customs were banned.Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools -Andrea Smith writing for Amnesty International Magazine on the historic government policy of forcing over 100,000 Native American children to attend Christian boarding schools, and the subsequent social reverberations of "widespread sexual and physical abuse" suffered at the hands of school administrators. Until the Freedom of Religion Act 1978, "spiritual leaders Native Americans ran the risk of jail sentences of up to 30 years for simply practicing their rituals."http://www.religioustolerance.org – Native American Spirituality The traditional indigenous Sun Dance was illegal from the 1880s (Canada) or 1904 (USA) to the 1980s.
Continuing charges of religious discrimination have largely centered on the eagle feather law, the use of ceremonial peyote, and the repatriation of Native American human remains and cultural and religious objects:

===Situation of atheists===

A 2006 study at the University of Minnesota showed atheists to be the most distrusted minority among Americans. In the study, sociologists Penny Edgell, Joseph Gerties and Douglas Hartmann conducted a survey of American public opinion on attitudes towards different groups. 40% of respondents characterized atheists as a group that "does not at all agree with my vision of American society", putting atheists well ahead of every other group, with the next highest being Muslims (26%) and homosexuals (23%). When participants were asked whether they agreed with the statement, "I would disapprove if my child wanted to marry a member of this group," atheists again led minorities, with 48% disapproval, followed by Muslims (34%) and African-Americans (27%).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.volokh.com/posts/1144075320.shtml|title=Hostility to Atheism – The Last Socially Acceptable Prejudice?[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last= Penny Edgell |first= |authorlink= | coauthors= Joseph Gerteis, and Douglas Hartmann |date=April 2006 |title=Atheists As "Other": Moral Boundaries and Cultural Membership in American Society |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages= |id= |url=http://www2.asanet.org/journals/asr/2006/toc050.html |accessdate= |quote=[/tpl] Joe Foley, co-chairman for Campus Atheists and Secular Humanists, commented on the results, "I know atheists aren't studied that much as a sociological group, but I guess atheists are one of the last groups remaining that it's still socially acceptable to hate."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/03/24/67686|title=Survey: U.S. trust lowest for atheists[/tpl]
Several private organizations, the most notable being the Boy Scouts of America, do not allow atheist members.[tpl]cite journal | title = Discrimination against atheists: the facts | author = Downey, Margaret | authorlink = Margaret Downey | journal = Free Inquiry | volume = 24 | issue = 4 |date=June–July 2004 | pages = 41–43 [/tpl] However, this policy has come under fire by organizations who assert that the Boy Scouts of America do benefit from taxpayer money and thus cannot be called a truly private organization, and thus must admit atheists, and others currently barred from membership. An organization called Scouting for All, founded by Eagle Scout Steven Cozza, is at the forefront of the movement.

====Court cases====

In the 1994 case[tpl]cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.FindLaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=000&invol=U10355|title=FindLaw[/tpl] Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet, Supreme Court Justice David Souter wrote in the opinion for the Court that: "government should not prefer one religion to another, or religion to irreligion".[tpl]cite web|url=http://supct.Law.Cornell.edu/supct/html/93-517.ZS.html|title=Cornell Law[/tpl] Everson v. Board of Education established that "neither a state nor the Federal Government can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another". This applies the Establishment Clause to the states as well as the federal government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://Atheism.About.com/library/decisions/religion/bl_l_BoEEverson.htm|title=About Atheism[/tpl] However, several state constitutions make the protection of persons from religious discrimination conditional on their acknowledgment of the existence of a deity, making freedom of religion in those states inapplicable to atheists. These state constitutional clauses have not been tested. Civil rights cases are typically brought in federal courts, so such state provisions are mainly of symbolic importance.
In Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, after atheist Michael Newdow challenged the phrase "under God" in the United States Pledge of Allegiance, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found the phrase unconstitutional. Although the decision was stayed pending the outcome of an appeal, there was the prospect that the pledge would cease to be legally usable without modification in schools in the western United States, over which the Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction. This resulted in political furor, and both houses of Congress passed resolutions condemning the decision, unanimously.[tpl]cite news|url=http://Archives.CNN.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/06/26/senate.resolution.pledge/index.html|title=CNN | date=2002-06-27 | accessdate=2010-05-02[/tpl] On June 26, a Republican-dominated group of 100–150 congressmen stood outside the capital and recited the pledge, showing how much they disagreed with the decision. The Supreme Court subsequently reversed the decision, ruling that Newdow did not have standing to bring his case, thus disposing of the case without ruling on the constitutionality of the pledge.
