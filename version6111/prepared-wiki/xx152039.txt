Tista Das or simply Tista (born 20 December 1976) a noted transsexual, is an Indian actress who has acted in quite a few Hindi and Bengali film industry productions as lead actress along with playing other supporting roles.

==Personal life==

Born Sushanto Das, Tista was diagnosed with gender identity disorder (GID) at an early stage of life and consequently underwent sex reassignment surgery with the help of Dr. Sheila Rohatgi, a prominent plastic surgeon from Kolkata who specializes in SRS procedures. Following this Tista went public with her identity and was a source of much controversy and social upheaval regarding stereotypes associated with the transsexual community. Her case played a pivotal role in changing the misconceptions in Indian society about transsexuality and went on to provoke a positive national debate in the press and the media on the ethics of sex change and transsexual rights in India. A social activist in transsexual issues and a vocal proponent of transsexual rights, Tista is also a prominent actress with a string of film and television soap appearances to her credit. Tista is regarded by many as an icon of empowerment and choice for the transsexual community in India.
Although she was rejected admission initially for undergraduate studies at Rabindra Bharati University, she graduated through correspondence from Bethune College of the University of Calcutta http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TSsuccesses/Tista/Tista.html.
