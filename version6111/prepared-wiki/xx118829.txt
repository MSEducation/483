[[Cyathea costalisora]]

CATEGORIES: Cyathea, Fern species

Cyathea costalisora is a species of tree fern native to western New Guinea, where it grows on the edges of forest and in moist hollows at an altitude of 1900-3225 m. The trunk is erect, up to 4 m tall and may branch near the base. Fronds are bi- or tripinnate and 1-1.5 m long. The stipe is warty, especially where scales have fallen. The scales are pale and have a distinctive dark glossy central region, with a paler dull margin. Sori are round and occur near the fertile pinnule midvein. They are covered by firm, dark indusia that are cup-like in appearance.
C. costalisora should not be confused with the similarly named Cyathea costulisora.
