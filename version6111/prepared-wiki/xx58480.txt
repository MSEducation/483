[[Flag of New Zealand]]

CATEGORIES: Blue Ensigns, Flags of New Zealand, National flags, National symbols of New Zealand, Southern Cross Flags

The flag of New Zealand is a defaced Blue Ensign with the Union Flag in the canton, and four red stars with white borders to the right. The stars represent the constellation of Crux, the Southern Cross. 
New Zealand's first flag, the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, was adopted before New Zealand became a British colony. Chosen by an assembly of Māori chiefs in 1834, the flag was of a St George's Cross with another cross in the canton containing four stars on a blue field. After the formation of the colony in 1841, British ensigns began to be used. The current flag was designed and adopted for restricted use in 1869 and became the national flag in 1902. It is the British Blue Ensign, incorporating a stylised representation of the Southern Cross showing the four brightest stars in the constellation. Each star varies slightly in size. The Union Flag in the canton recalls New Zealand's colonial ties to Britain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/nz-identity-heritage/flags|title=Flags|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage (New Zealand)|date=23 July 2010|accessdate=2011-09-06[/tpl]
The flag proportion is 1:2 and the colours are red (Pantone 186C), blue (Pantone 280C) and white. Proportion and colours are identical to the Union Flag.

==History==

===Flag of the United Tribes===

The need for a flag of New Zealand first became clear when the trading ship Sir George Murray, built in the Hokianga, was seized by Customs officials in the port of Sydney. The ship had been sailing without a flag, a violation of British navigation laws. New Zealand was not a colony at the time and had no flag. Among the passengers on the ship were two high-ranking Māori chiefs, believed to be Patuone and Taonui. The ship's detainment was reported as arousing indignation among the Māori population. Unless a flag was selected, ships would continue to be seized.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/nzflag/history/united.html| title=Flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand (1834-1840)| work=History of the New Zealand Flag| publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage| location=New Zealand| accessdate=2007-02-16| quote=Without a flag to represent the new nation, trading ships and their valuable cargoes would continue to be seized[/tpl][tpl]failed verification |date=April 2012[/tpl]
The first flag of New Zealand was adopted 9 (or 20) March 1834 by a vote made by the United Tribes of New Zealand, a meeting of Māori chiefs convened at Waitangi by British resident James Busby. The United Tribes later made the Declaration of Independence of New Zealand at Waitangi in 1835. Three flags were proposed, all designed by the missionary Henry Williams, who was to play a major role in the translation of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. The chiefs rejected two other proposals which included the Union Flag, in favour of a modified St George's Cross or the White Ensign, which was the flag used by Henry Williams on the Church Missionary Society ships.[tpl]cite web| work = Dictionary of New Zealand Biography | title= 'United Tribes flag' | date = 19 November 2010|url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/taming-the-frontier/united-tribes-flag| accessdate=2010-08-26[/tpl][tpl]cite book | author=Caroline Fitzgerald | title= Te Wiremu - Henry Williams: Early Years in the North | year= 2011 | isbn=978-1-86969-439-5| publisher= Huia Press [/tpl] 231 This flag became known as the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/flags-of-new-zealand/united-tribes-flag|title=New Zealand History - 'United Tribes flag'|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=20 March 2010|accessdate=2010-12-28[/tpl] and was officially gazetted in New South Wales in August 1835, with a general description not mentioning fimbriation or the number of points on the stars.[tpl]Ref|1|a[/tpl] The need for a flag was pressing, not only because New Zealand-built ships were being impounded in Sydney for not flying a national flag, but also as a symbol of the independence declared by the Māori chiefs.
The flag is still flown on the flag pole at Waitangi, and can be seen on Waitangi Day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://history-nz.org/colonisation2.html|title=History of New Zealand - The colonisation of New Zealand|year=2006|accessdate=2010-12-28[/tpl]

===Union Flag===

After the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, the British Union Flag was used, although the former United Tribes flag was still used by a number of ships from New Zealand and in many cases on land. The New Zealand Company settlement at Wellington, for example, continued to use the United Tribes flag until ordered to replace it by Governor William Hobson in May 1840 (following his declaration of British sovereignty).[tpl]DNZB|last=Simpson|first=K.

===Flags based on defaced Blue ensign===

The first flag of New Zealand to be based on the British blue ensign was introduced in 1867 following the Colonial Navy Defence Act 1865, which required all ships owned by colonial governments fly the defaced Royal Navy blue ensign with a Colonial badge. New Zealand did not have a Colonial badge, or indeed a Coat of Arms of its own at this stage, and so the letters "NZ" were simply added to the blue ensign.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flaggenlexikon.de/fneuseel.htm |title=Flagge Neuseeland |accessdate=2003-09-07 |author=Volker Preuß|coauthors= |language=German[/tpl]
In 1869 the First Lieutenant of the Royal Navy vessel HMS Blanche, Albert Hastings Markham, submitted a design to Sir George Bowen, the Governor of New Zealand, for a national ensign for New Zealand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/polar/markham.htm|title=Rear-Admiral Sir Albert Hastings Markham, Norfolk Museums and Archeology Service|accessdate=2008-11-18[/tpl][tpl]Dead link | date=April 2012[/tpl] It was initially used only on government ships, but was adopted as the de facto national flag in a surge of patriotism arising from the Second Boer War in 1902. To end confusion between various designs of the flag, the Liberal Government passed the Ensign and Code Signals Bill, which was approved by King Edward VII on 24 March 1902,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rbvex.it/oceanpag/nzel.html|publisher=http://www.rbvex.it|title=New Zealand Signalling Ensign|language=Italian|accessdate=2004-08-20[/tpl] declaring the flag as New Zealand's national flag. The United Tribes flag design also features on the back of the Second Boer War medals presented to soldiers who served in the war,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-medals/new_zealand2.htm| title=Medals of New Zealand| work=Medals| publisher=Digger History|first=Ted|last=Harris| accessdate=2010-01-17| quote=The edge of the reverse of the medal reads 'Success to New Zealand Contingent 1899–1900' and the flag depicted appears to be the Flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, chosen by northern Maori in 1834[/tpl][tpl]Dead link | date=April 2012[/tpl] which indicates that the United Tribes flag was used widely in New Zealand until around this time.

==Legislation==

The national flag is defined in legislation as "the symbol of the Realm, Government, and people of New Zealand"Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981, s 5(2). and like most other laws, can be changed by a simple majority in Parliament.

===Entrenchment proposal===

In March 1994 the Prime Minister of New Zealand Jim Bolger made statements supporting a move towards a New Zealand republic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.nz/node/29#1994|publisher=New Zealand Republic|date=November 2007|title=History of Republicanism in New Zealand - 1994|accessdate=2007-11-27[/tpl] In response Christian Democrat MP Graeme Lee introduced a Flags, Anthems, Emblems, and Names Protection Amendment Bill.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bennion.co.nz/mlr/1994/sep.html|publisher=Maori Law Review|date=September 1994|title=Maori Law Review - New Zealand[/tpl] If passed, the Bill would have entrenched the Act that governs the flag and added New Zealand's anthems, requiring a majority of 65 percent of votes in Parliament before any future legislation could change the flag. The Bill passed its first reading but was defeated at its second reading, 26 votes to 37.

==New Zealand flag debate==

Debate on keeping or changing the New Zealand Flag started before May 1973, when a remit to change the flag was voted down by the Labour Party at their national conference.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/John%20Moody.pdf|title=Past Attempts to Change New Zealand's Flag|first=John |last=Moody|publisher=New Zealand Flag Association |format=pdf |accessdate=2012-04-29[/tpl] In November 1979 when the Minister of Internal Affairs, Allan Highet, suggested that the design of the flag should be changed, and sought an artist to design a new flag with a silver fern on the fly. The proposal attracted little support however.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Flags of the World|title=New Zealand - Proposals for a new flag|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/nz!.html|date=29 September 2006|accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl] In 1998 Prime Minister Jenny Shipley backed Cultural Affairs Minister Marie Hasler's call for the flag to be changed. Shipley, along with the New Zealand Tourism Board, backed the quasi-national silver fern flag, using a white silver fern on a black background as a possible alternative flag, along the lines of the Canadian Maple Leaf Flag. On 5 August 2010 Labour list MP Charles Chauvel introduced a members Bill for a consultative commission followed by a referendum on the New Zealand flag.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1008/S00083/bill-advocates-consultative-debate-on-new-flag.htm|title=Bill advocates consultative debate on new flag|date=5 August 2010|work=Scoop.co.nz|accessdate=2012-04-29[/tpl] 
On 11 March 2014, Prime Minister John Key announced in a speech his intention to hold a referendum, during the next parliamentary term, on adopting a new flag.[tpl]cite news|title=New Zealand to hold referendum on new, ‘post-colonial’ flag|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/11/new-zealand-to-hold-referendum-on-new-post-colonial-flag|accessdate=11 March 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=New Zealand to hold referendum on national flag|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26524132|accessdate=11 March 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=11 March 2014[/tpl]

==Similar flags==

The New Zealand flag was the first national flag to incorporate the stars of the Southern Cross constellation, and remains distinctive as the only national flag that includes only those stars from the constellation that actually form the cross itself. 
The newer Australian flag is a variant of the flag of New Zealand, both having the Union Flag in the canton and the Southern Cross on the fly. The cross on the New Zealand flag is composed of the four prime stars of the Southern Cross constellation, each being a red five pointed star with a white outline. The Australian flag has six white stars, five of which have seven points (the Commonwealth Star) and a five pointed star, Epsilon Crucis, the smaller star of the Southern Cross constellation which does not form part of the actual cross itself is also included.  Australia's flag features a large Commonwealth Star below the Union Flag as it is a symbol of Australia.
Many other flags also contain the Southern Cross, some as far back as the 1823/24 National Colonial Flag for Australia.
