[[Same-sex marriage in Canada]]

CATEGORIES: Same-sex marriage in Canada, Paul Martin

On July 20, 2005, Canada became the fourth country in the world, and the first country outside Europe, to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide with the enactment of the Civil Marriage Act which provided a gender-neutral marriage definition. Court decisions, starting in 2003, had already legalized same-sex marriage in eight out of ten provinces and one of three territories, whose residents comprised about 90% of Canada's population. Before passage of the Act, more than 3,000 same-sex couples had already married in those areas.[tpl]cite news |title=Canada passes bill to legalize gay marriage |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/29/world/americas/29iht-web.0629canada.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 29, 2005 |accessdate=November 3, 2013[/tpl] Most legal benefits commonly associated with marriage had been extended to cohabiting same-sex couples since 1999.
The Civil Marriage Act was introduced by Prime Minister Paul Martin's Liberal minority government in the Canadian House of Commons on February 1, 2005 as Bill C-38. It was passed by the House of Commons on June 28, 2005, by the Senate on July 19, 2005, and it received Royal Assent the following day. On December 7, 2006, the House of Commons effectively reaffirmed the legislation by a vote of 175 to 123, defeating a motion of the Conservative minority government to examine the matter again. This was the third vote supporting same-sex marriage taken by three Parliaments under three Prime Ministers in three different years, as shown below.

==Same-sex marriage by province==

Same-sex marriage was legally recognized in the provinces and territories as of the following dates:
Note that in some of these cases, the marriage was in fact legal at an earlier date (for example, the Ontario ruling held that marriages performed in January 2001 were legal when performed), but the legality was questioned.  As of the given dates, the legality was authoritatively established.
The decision by the Ontario government to recognize the marriage that took place in Toronto, Ontario, on January 14, 2001, retroactively makes Canada the first country in the world to have a government-legitimized same-sex marriage (the Netherlands and Belgium, which legalized same-sex marriage before Canada, had their first in April 2001 and June 2003, respectively).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.samesexmarriage.ca/legal/ontario_case/cer300604.htm |title=First same-sex marriage in the world now recognized |publisher=Samesexmarriage.ca |accessdate=February 19, 2011[/tpl]

==Overview==

Same-sex marriage was originally legalized as a result of court cases in which provincial or territorial justices ruled existing bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. Thereafter, many same-sex couples obtained marriage licences in those provinces; like opposite-sex couples, they did not need to be residents of any of those provinces to marry there.
