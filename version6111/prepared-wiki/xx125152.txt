==Playing career==

Lawrence began his career as a midfielder, starting out late at Grays Athletic in August 1995, age 21, having taken an American Literature degree, whilst playing college football (soccer, to distinguish from American football) in the States for Hartwick College. In February 2009, Hartwick inducted Lawrence into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hartwick.edu/x26103.xml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100527154700/http://www.hartwick.edu/x26103.xml |archivedate=27 May 2010 |title=Hartwick College to Induct Eight Into Athletic Hall of Fame |publisher= Hartwick College|date=17 February 2009|accessdate=19 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hartwickhawks.com/hof.aspx?hof=110&path=&kiosk= |title=Hartwick Athletics Hall of Fame|publisher=Hartwick College |accessdate=19 October 2013[/tpl]
Five months later, he became a Football League player, when he joined Wycombe Wanderers, for £20,000. He made 21 appearances for Wycombe before moving on to Fulham, for an undisclosed fee. He spent a strong 20 months at the West-London side, making over 60 appearances, before going back to Wycombe, on a free transfer, following Fulham's failure to gain promotion to Division One.
He had a more successful spell at The Chairboys this time, before going to Millwall in March 2000, for £200,000. At The Lions, he began a new role, as a right-back, and starred, only missing one game and being voted the fans' "Player of The Year", as Millwall were promoted to Division One as champions in 2000–01 season. He started the 2001–02 season well, but sustained concussion, the results of which kept him out of the side for some time. On his return, he found his best form to date for the Lions, as they reached the Division One play-offs.
At the start of the 2003–04 campaign, Lawrence fell out with Lions boss Mark McGhee, and looked to be on his way out The New Den. However, McGhee was replaced by Dennis Wise, and Lawrence got his place back. It was then that he switched to central defence, playing alongside Darren Ward, and the dynamic duo stood out, with the Lions reaching the 2004 FA Cup Final, and thus qualifying for the UEFA Cup.
Boss Wise left the club at the end of the 2004–05 season, and defensive partner Ward left for Crystal Palace, and Lawrence found himself playing in a number of positions, under a variety of different managers, during the disastrous 2005–06 campaign, as the Lions were relegated back to League One.
Nigel Spackman was appointed manager at the New Den, but Lawrence did not play competitively under him, as he moved to rivals Crystal Palace, to rekindle his partnership with Darren Ward. After an average first season, Lawrence began to excel under the leadership of Neil Warnock at Selhurst Park. He scored his first goal for Palace against Sheffield Wednesday on 22 March 2008. His contract at Selhurst Park expired at the end of the 2009–10 season, and in August 2010 he joined Gillingham of League Two on a one year deal,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.com/page/PressReleases/0,,10416~2119585,00.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120326111732/http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.com/page/PressReleases/0,,10416~2119585,00.html |archivedate=26 March 2012 |title=Gills snap up Palace defender |publisher= Gillingham F.C.|date=7 October 2010 |accessdate=19 October 2013[/tpl] and made his debut for them in goalless draw away to Hereford United on 14 August.
