Jay Jay Burridge also known as Jay Burridge (born 12 January 1971) is an artist and former television presenter. He fronted the BBC children's art programme SMart from 1994 until 2003, when he left and became a graphic designer and snowboard inventor. He was a close friend of colleague Mark Speight.

==Career==

He graduated from Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design with a degree in art, and in 1994 auditioned for the role as a presenter on the BBC children's art programme SMart.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/apr/18/bbc.television|title=Mark and me|accessdate=2008-10-05|date=18 April 2008|first=Jay |last=Burridge|work=The Guardian[/tpl] At his interview he met Mark Speight, and the two soon formed a strong friendship. Burridge and Speight were given the jobs of presenting SMart alongside Zoë Ball. Ball left, and was replaced by Josie d'Arby who was then replaced by Kirsten O'Brien and Lizi Botham in 1999. Together with O'Brien and Botham they fronted the SMart spin-off shows SMart on the Road and SMarteenies, as well as appearing at many other art-related events.[tpl]Cite news|title=TV presenter Jay is a big draw with art fans at store|accessdate=2008-10-05|date=8 August 2000|work=Wiltshire County Publications[/tpl]
Together, Burridge and Speight created all of the art projects for each episode of SMart at Burridge's West London art studio. He noted: "We would bounce ideas and jokes off each other all day until we had developed an almost telepathically linked knowledge of what made each other laugh."
Burridge left SMart in 2003, feeling he had "outgrown his role as a children's TV presenter," and wanted to move "out of the limelight". He worked as a commercial artist before becoming a producer for a TV company, as well as working as a graphic designer and snowboard inventor.[tpl]Cite news|title=Living Review Design: We can make it|accessdate=2008-09-05|date=6 October 2002|author=Kate Worsley|work=Independent on Sunday[/tpl] He is the founder of the design company Laughing Boy and Lucky Seven, a hat company which specialises in crested baseball caps emblazoned with the logos of fictional companies from TV shows and films.

==Personal life==

Burridge is married. He was close friends with Speight and the two formed an "on- and off-screen double act" and regularly attended the Regency Rooms comedy nights together. Following the death of Speight's fiancée Natasha Collins in January 2008, Burridge met up with him on several occasions and "tried to get him to see that the worst was over", although he realised that Speight "might not be able to keep going". Burridge spoke to Speight on 7 April 2008 and arranged to meet up with him later in the day. Speight, however, disappeared and committed suicide later that day.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/femail/article-1068093/Drugs-death-despair-How-death-TV-presenter-Mark-Speights-fiancee-sparked-spiral-tragedy.html |title=Drugs, death and despair: How death of TV presenter Mark Speight's fiancee sparked a spiral of tragedy |last=Cable |first=Amanda |publisher=Mail on Sunday|date=4 October 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-04[/tpl] Burridge had helped police try to locate Speight, and was informed of his death on 13 April.
