==Principal==

Trey Kraemer, an Humble resident who had been serving as Principal of Sterling High School in Goose Creek CISD, was named Principal during the summer of 2008. In the summer of 2011, the job was passed over to former AMS and WMS principal, Thyrun Hurst.

==Design==

Summer Creek High School incorporates a Frank Lloyd Wright style to the exterior facade. The floor plan of Summer Creek is similar to Atascocita High School's, which uses the house system, or smaller learning communities. Each student will be assigned to a "house" in which they will work with an Assistant Principal-Counselor pair for all four years at the school. Core classes (Math, Science, English, and Social Studies) will be attended in that house, but electives will be located in a special wing of the school. The district believes this concept will make a rather large high school feel like a small one. 
Quest High School, the district's alternate high school, will move into one of the houses at Summer Creek starting in August 2009.
