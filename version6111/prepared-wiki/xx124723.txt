Santa Coloma de Gramenet ([tpl]IPA-ca|ˈsantə kuˈɫomə ðə ɣɾəməˈnɛt[/tpl]) (informally simply known as Santa Coloma; historically also known as Gramenet del Besòs) is a city in Catalonia, Spain. It is situated on the south-east side of the Litoral range, with the Puig Castellar (299 m) 
as its highest point, on the left bank of the Besòs river: the municipalities of Sant Adrià de Besòs and Badalona 
separate it from the coast. It is essentially a banlieue (or suburb) of Barcelona.
The area has been inhabited since at least the Iberic period, and the remains of an Iberic village have been found on 
Puig Castellar. The artefacts are housed in a museum in La Torre Balldovina, a building dating from the 18th century.
Other notable buildings include the renaissance palace of La Torre Pallaresa and the noucentista
Clínica Mental.
In November 2008, the city made worldwide news by installing solar panels on top of crypts in the local cemetery, in an effort to help fight climate change.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7745673.stm
