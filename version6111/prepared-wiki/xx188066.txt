The Dent de Morcles is a 2,969 metres high mountain located at western end of the Bernese Alps, overlooking the Rhone between Martigny and St. Maurice.
The summit is sometimes distinguished by the name Grande Dent de Morcles, the Petite Dent de Morcles being a lower summit (2,929 m) on the north-west side. Both summits are located on the border between Valais and Vaud.
On the northern slopes lies the small Glacier des Martinets. The Lac de Fully is located on the south side.
