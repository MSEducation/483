Three circuits were added to the 2004 schedule, replacing three events which did not return from 2003.  The sprint event at Road Atlanta along with Circuit Trois-Rivières and the Miami, Florida street circuit were removed, while Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course and Portland International Raceway both returned once again.  These were joined by the addition of Lime Rock Park. The removal of Trois-Rivières rendered Mosport as the only race outside the United States.
