Euclid is a CAD software which has been developed since 1970.  Initially written by Jean Marc Brun and Michel Théron at Laboratoire d'informatique pour la mécanique et les sciences de l'ingénieur (LIMSI) for modelling fluid flow, they founded their own company, Datavision in 1979 and then sold a controlling interest in 1980 to the French company Matra Datavision.[tpl]cite book | page=42 | title=The Political Context of Collective Action | series=Routledge/ECPR Studies in European Political Science | author=Ricca Edmondson | publisher=Routledge | year=1997 | isbn=0-203-44967-3 [/tpl]

As in 1998 Matra Datavision specialized in software service provider, Dassault Systèmes acquired QUANTUM products : Euclid Styler and Euclid Machinist.http://archives.lesechos.fr/archives/1998/LesEchos/17791-62-ECH.htm
In 1999 Matra Datavision published CAS.CADE in open source on the Internet as Open CASCADE later renamed to Open CASCADE Technology.http://www.opencascade.org/about/profile/history/
