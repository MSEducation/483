</ref>  It is becoming easier to find in clothing and other products, but these products often carry a higher price.  Wool is environmentally preferable (as compared to petroleum-based [[nylon]] or [[polypropylene]]) as a material for [[Carpetlayer|carpets]], as well, in particular when combined with a natural binding and the use of [[formaldehyde]]-free glues.
Animal rights groups have noted issues with the production of wool, such as mulesing.

==Marketing==

===Australia===

About 85% of wool sold in Australia is sold by open cry auction.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]  'Sale by sample' is a method in which a mechanical claw takes a sample from each bale in a line or lot of wool.  These grab samples are bulked, objectively measured, and a sample of not less than 4 kg is displayed in a box for the buyer to examine.  The Australian Wool Exchange conducts sales primarily in Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle, and Fremantle.  There are about 80 brokers and agents throughout Australia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
About 7% of Australian wool is sold by private treaty on farms or to local wool-handling facilities.  This option gives wool growers benefit from reduced transport, warehousing, and selling costs.  This method is preferred for small lots or mixed butts in order to make savings on reclassing and testing.
About 5% of Australian wool is sold over the internet on an electronic offer board.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] This option gives wool growers the ability to set firm price targets, reoffer passed-in wool and offer lots to the market quickly and efficiently. This method works well for tested lots, as buyers use these results to make a purchase. About 97% of wool is sold without sample inspection; however, as of December 2009, 59% of  wool listed had been passed in from auction.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] Growers through certain brokers can allocate their wool to a sale and at what price their wool will be reserved.
Sale by tender can achieve considerable cost savings on wool clips large enough to make it worthwhile for potential buyers to submit tenders.  Some marketing firms sell wool on a consignment basis, obtaining a fixed percentage as commission.
Forward selling: Some buyers offer a secure price for forward delivery of wool based on estimated measurements or the results of previous clips.  Prices are quoted at current market rates and are locked in for the season.  Premiums and discounts are added to cover variations in micron, yield, tensile strength, etc., which are confirmed by actual test results when available.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
Another method of selling wool includes sales direct to wool mills.

Less than half of New Zealand's wool is sold at auction, while around 45% of farmers sell wool directly to private buyers and end-users.Wool Production in New Zealand. maf.govt.nz
United States sheep producers market wool with private or cooperative wool warehouses, but wool pools are common in many states.  In some cases, wool is pooled in a local market area, but sold through a wool warehouse.  Wool offered with objective measurement test results is preferred.  Imported apparel wool and carpet wool goes directly to central markets, where it is handled by the large merchants and manufacturers.Wool Marketing. sheepusa.org

Virgin wool is wool spun for the first time.Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: Textiles, 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, ISBN 0-13-118769-4, p. 63
Shoddy or recycled wool is made by cutting or tearing apart existing wool fabric and respinning the resulting fibers.  As this process makes the wool fibers shorter, the remanufactured fabric is inferior to the original.  The recycled wool may be mixed with raw wool, wool noil, or another fiber such as cotton to increase the average fiber length.  Such yarns are typically used as weft yarns with a cotton warp.  This process was invented in the Heavy Woollen District of West Yorkshire and created a micro-economy in this area for many years.
Rag is a sturdy wool fiber made into yarn and used in many rugged applications such as gloves.
Worsted is a strong, long-staple, combed wool yarn with a hard surface.
Woolen is a soft, short-staple, carded wool yarn typically used for knitting.  In traditional weaving, woolen weft yarn (for softness and warmth) is frequently combined with a worsted warp yarn for strength on the loom.[ref]Østergård, Else:

==Uses==

In addition to clothing, wool has been used for blankets, horse rugs, saddle cloths, carpeting, felt, wool insulation (also see links) and upholstery.  Wool felt covers piano hammers, and it is used to absorb odors and noise in heavy machinery and stereo speakers.  Ancient Greeks lined their helmets with felt, and Roman legionnaires used breastplates made of wool felt.
Wool has also been traditionally used to cover cloth diapers.  Wool fiber exteriors are hydrophobic (repel water) and the interior of the wool fiber is hygroscopic (attracts water); this makes a wool garment able to cover a wet diaper while inhibiting wicking, so outer garments remain dry.  Wool felted and treated with lanolin is water resistant, air permeable, and slightly antibacterial, so it resists the buildup of odor.  Some modern cloth diapers use felted wool fabric for covers, and there are several modern commercial knitting patterns for wool diaper covers.
Initial studies of woolen underwear have found it prevented heat and sweat rashes because it more readily absorbs the moisture than other fibers.ABC Rural Radio: Woodhams, Dr. Libby, New research shows woollen underwear helps prevent rashes Retrieved 2010-3-24
Merino wool has been used in baby sleep products such as swaddle baby wrap blankets and infant sleeping bags.
As an animal protein, it can be used as a soil fertilizer, being a slow-release source of nitrogen and ready-made amino acids.
Researchers at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology school of fashion and textiles have discovered a blend of wool and kevlar, the synthetic fiber widely used in body armor, was lighter, cheaper and worked better in damp conditions than kevlar alone. Kevlar, when used alone, loses about 20% of its effectiveness when wet and therefore required an expensive waterproofing process. Wool increased friction in a vest with 28–30 layers of fabric, to provide the same level of bullet resistance as 36 layers of Kevlar alone.[tpl]cite news|last=Blenkin|first=Max|title=Wool's tough new image|accessdate=9 May 2011|newspaper=Country Leader|date=2011-04-11[/tpl]

==Events==

A buyer of Merino wool, Ermenegildo Zegna, has offered awards for Australian wool producers.  In 1963 the first Ermenegildo Zegna Perpetual Trophy was presented in Tasmania for growers of "Superfine skirted Merino fleece". In 1980, a national award, the Ermenegildo Zegna Trophy for Extrafine Wool Production, was launched.  In 2004, this award became known as the Ermenegildo Zegna Unprotected Wool Trophy.  In 1998, an Ermenegildo Zegna Protected Wool Trophy was launched for fleece from sheep coated for around nine months of the year.
In 2002, the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum Trophy was launched for wool that is 13.9 micron and finer.  Wool from Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa may enter, and a winner is named from each country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=345179|title=2004/51/1 Trophy and plaque, Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum trophy and plaque, plaster / bronze / silver / gold, trophy designed and made by Not Vital for Ermenegildo Zegna, Switzerland, 2001 | publisher=Powerhouse Museum, Sydney|accessdate=2008-04-27[/tpl]  In April 2008, New Zealand won the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum Trophy for the first time with a fleece that measured 10.8 microns.  This contest awards the winning fleece weight with the same weight in gold as a prize, hence the name.
In 2010 an ultra-fine, 10 micron fleece, from Windradeen, near Pyramul, New South Wales, set a new world record in the fineness of wool fleeces when it won the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum International Trophy.Country Leader, 26 April 2010, Finest wool rewarded, Rural Press, North Richmond
Since 2000, Loro Piana has awarded a cup for the world's finest bale of wool that produces just enough fabric for 50 tailor-made suits.  The prize is awarded to an Australian or New Zealand wool grower who produces the year's finest bale.Australian Wool Network News, Issue #19, July 2008
The New England Merino Field days which display local studs, wool, and sheep are held during January, every two years (in even numbered years) around the Walcha, New South Wales district.  The Annual Wool Fashion Awards, which showcase the use of Merino wool by fashion designers, are hosted by the city of Armidale, New South Wales, in March each year.  This event encourages young and established fashion designers to display their talents.  During each May, Armidale hosts the annual New England Wool Expo to display wool fashions, handicrafts, demonstrations, shearing competitions, yard dog trials, and more.
In July, the annual Australian Sheep and Wool Show is held in Bendigo, Victoria. This is the largest sheep and wool show in the world, with goats and alpacas as well as woolcraft competitions and displays, fleece competitions, sheepdog trials, shearing, and wool handling. The largest competition in the world for objectively measured fleeces is the Australian Fleece Competition, which is held annually at Bendigo.  In 2008 there were 475 entries from all states of Australia with first and second prizes going to the Northern Tablelands, New South Wales fleeces.Walcha News (2008-07-24, Fletcher Wins Australian Fleece Comp, p. 3
