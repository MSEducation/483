Intimate Portraits, what Lui calls "intimate/psychological/anthropological portraits on today’s hybrid generation of new nomads who have lost their roots and origins due to the onslaught of globalism" was initiated 20 years ago and continues to develop to this day. Lui’s silent portraits show the existential urgency of each individual’s existence through the space or objects surrounding him/her, the intrinsic gestures and physical positioning of the individual within his/her environment. With this constantly evolving series, she has won several awards including France’s 20th Bourse du Talent (Young Talent Award for Photography)Bourse du TalentWikipédia La Bourse du Talent and the Prix Kodak de la Critique Photographique (Kodak Critics’ Award),"Prix Kodak de la Critique Photographique 2003", 2003 Belgium’s Prix National de la Photographie Ouverte du Musée de la Photographie à CharleroiMusée de la Photo, Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles and was in 2008 a finalist for the Prix de la Fondation HSBC pour la Photographie.Fondation HSBC pour la Photographie 2008

==Background==

Diana Lui’s interest in different art forms is due to her early education in the arts in Malaysia ranging from Chinese ink painting to the performance arts such as ballet and contemporary dance. Her studies in the fine arts in UCLA (University California Los Angeles) were guided by teachers who were prominent artists of the 1960s Post-Modernist period such as Robert Heinecken and Jan Stüssy. In UCLA, Lui experimented with drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpting and photography. She further deepened her art studies at the prestigious Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. Her graduation project combined printing processes such as photogravure and platinum/palladium printing in order to create subtle black and white portraits taken with an 8x10 inch view camera. Lui was able to successfully master these alternative printing processes thanks to her teacher Anthony Zepeda, Los Angeles master printmaker, a former printer of Rauschenberg's.Bowne, Kristine.

Though photography has predominated her work, her recent projects have evolved into new themes that push the limits of photography by combining installation, performance, experimental short films, painting and drawing. Lui’s transient life between three different continents has developed in her a heightened sense of “rootlessness”, loss of origins and traditional values. This “rootlessness” has become the center from which her art and research has taken shape.Official biography of Diana Lui http://www.99medusas.com/site.php?page=bio, "http://www.99medusas.com/site.php?page=bio&index=1". retrieved August 11, 2013
