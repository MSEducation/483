Flaming Guns of the Purple Sage is a sadistic satirical play by Jane Martin.
Big 8, a feisty rodeo competitor, is a bitter critter, facing foreclosure on the Wyoming ranch where she rehabilitates injured rodeo cowboys. The arrival of a shocking woman named Shedevil and a one eyed Ukrainian biker named Black Dog ushers in outrageous violence and horror in this shoot ‘em up, knock ‘em up, cut ‘em up comic romp that roasts the cowboy mentality of pulp western writers like Zane Grey.
"Borrows a heap of corniness from the B movie Westerns and mixes a few pieces of horror in this hilarious, rip snortin' and effusively bloody play." - Playbill.com.
