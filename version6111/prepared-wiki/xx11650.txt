[[Volcanic Explosivity Index]]

CATEGORIES: Volcanology, Hazard scales

The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) was devised by Chris Newhall of the US Geological Survey and Stephen Self at the University of Hawaii in 1982 to provide a relative measure of the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions.
Volume of products, eruption cloud height, and qualitative observations (using terms ranging from "gentle" to "mega-colossal") are used to determine the explosivity value. The scale is open-ended with the largest volcanoes in history given magnitude 8.  A value of 0 is given for non-explosive eruptions, defined as less than [tpl]convert|10000|m3|cuft|abbr=on[/tpl] of tephra ejected; and 8 representing a  mega-colossal explosive eruption that can eject [tpl]convert/E|1E12|m3|cuft|abbr=on[/tpl] of tephra and have a cloud column height of over [tpl]convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. The scale is logarithmic, with each interval on the scale representing a tenfold increase in observed ejecta criteria, with the exception of between VEI 0, VEI 1 and VEI 2.[ref]

Ash, lava, lava bombs and ignimbrite are all treated alike. Density and vesicularity (gas bubbling) of the volcanic products in question is not taken into account. In contrast, the DRE (Dense-Rock Equivalent) is sometimes calculated to give the actual amount of magma erupted. Another weakness of the VEI is that it does not take into account the power output of an eruption, which makes it extremely difficult to determine with prehistoric or unobserved eruptions.

==Classification==

With indices running from 0 to 8, the VEI associated with an eruption is dependent on how much volcanic material is thrown out, to what height, and how long the eruption lasts. The scale is logarithmic from VEI 2 and up; an increase of 1 index indicates an eruption that is 10 times as powerful. As such there is a discontinuity in the definition of the VEI between indices 1 and 2. The lower border of the volume of ejecta jumps by a factor of 100 from [tpl]convert|10000|to|1000000|m3|cuft|abbr=on[/tpl] while the factor is 10 between all higher indices.
A total of 47 eruptions of VEI 8 magnitude or above, ranging in age from Ordovician to Pleistocene, have been identified, of which 42 occurred in the past 36 million years. The most recent is Lake Taupo's Oruanui eruption, 26,500 years ago, which means that there have not been any Holocene (within the last 10,000 years) eruptions with a VEI of 8.[tpl]cite journal |last=Mason |first=Ben G. |authorlink= |coauthors=Pyle, David M.; Oppenheimer, Clive |year=2004 |title=The size and frequency of the largest explosive eruptions on Earth |journal=Bulletin of Volcanology |volume=66 |issue=8 |pages=735–748 |doi=10.1007/s00445-004-0355-9 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 2004BVol...66..735M [/tpl] There have been at least five identified Holocene eruptions with a VEI of 7. There are also 58 plinian eruptions, and 13 caldera-forming eruptions, of large, but unknown magnitudes. There are likely many other eruptions that are not identified.
