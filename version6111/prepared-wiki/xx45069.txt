Ichirō Hatoyama was, as his name indicates, the first born boy. He was born into a wealthy cosmopolitan family in Tokyo.

==Political career==

Ichirō was elected to the House of Representatives as a Rikken Seiyūkai member in 1915. He was about to become prime minister in 1946, but was barred from politics for five years by Supreme Commander Allied Powers because they thought he had co-operated with the authoritarian government in the 1930s and 1940s.Crane, Burton.

CIA files that were declassified in 2005 and then publicized in January 2007 by the U.S. National Archives detail a plot by ultranationalists to assassinate then prime minister Shigeru Yoshida and install a more hawkish government led by Ichirō Hatoyama in 1952.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,126978,00.html?ESRC=topstories.RSS|title=CIA Papers Reveal Japan Coup Plot |publisher=Military|accessdate=29 August 2009[/tpl] The plot was never carried out.

==Hatoyama family and freemasonry==

Ichirō and some members of Hatoyama family are known as advocates of fraternity. During the purge against Ichirō (1946–1951), he received an English book The Totalitarian State against Man originally written in German by an Austrian freemason Richard Nikolaus von Coudenhove-Kalergi from a professor of Waseda University Kesazō Ichimura (1898–1950) who wanted Ichirō to translate the English book into Japanese.[tpl]cite web |date= 2004-09-10|url= http://yuaikyoukai.com/shinbun/471.pdf|title= 第471号|format= PDF|work= Newsletter "友愛"|publisher= Yuai Association|quote= 今朝蔵は、「この本の翻訳は鳩山一郎さんにして貰おう。 (中略) 鳩山さんは往年の優等生だから、この位の翻訳軽く出来るよ。歴代の総理大臣でこれだけの本を出版した人なんて誰もいない。その日の為にもこの翻訳をしておいて貰いたいんだ」などと一寸おしゃべりして雲場ヶ池の鳩山家の別荘に自転車で出かけて行ったそうである。|accessdate= 2 May 2013[/tpl] The English book struck a sympathetic chord in Ichirō, and he began to advocate fraternity, also known as yūai (友愛) in Japanese.[tpl]cite book |last= Hatoyama|first= Ichirō|title= 鳩山一郎回顧録|year= 1957|publisher= Bungeishunjū|location= Tokyo[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://yuaikyoukai.com/katudo2006_douzou1.html|title= 2006年8月 鳩山一郎・薫ご夫妻銅遷座式|publisher= Yuai Association|quote= クーデンホフカレルギーの著書に共鳴自ら「自由と人生」と題して訳出した|accessdate= 2 May 2013[/tpl]

His grandsons are advocates of fraternity. However, when a Japanese press asked Yukio Hatoyama's office and the masonic grand lodge of Japan whether Yukio Hatoyama was a freemason, his office denied it and the grand lodge of Japan didn't answer it.[tpl]cite web |url= http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/6278932/|title= 鳩山氏改名とフリーメイソンの関係噂は「事実無根」と事務所|author= Weeklypost|date= 2012-02-14|publisher= Livedoor news|accessdate=2 May 2013[/tpl] At least, on his grandson Kunio Hatoyama, the brother of Yukio, on a Japanese TV program TAKAJIN NO MONEY on August 25, 2012,[tpl]cite web |url= http://tvtopic.goo.ne.jp/kansai/program/info/119890/index.html|title= たかじんNOマネー|date= 2012-08-25|work= 関西版TVトピック検索|publisher= tvtopic.goo.ne.jp|accessdate=2 May 2013[/tpl] his partner Emily's Australian father was a member of freemasonry. He said so, and said he had swum in a masonic pool with her at Tokyo when he had started to going steady with her.  Although he didn't say he himself was a mason or not, he insisted that he had not been invited to freemasonry, and he guessed his brother Yukio as a freemason.
Yukio and Kunio became the officers of a fraternal organization named Yuai Kyokai (or Yuai Association[tpl]cite web |url= http://yuaikyoukai.com/english.html|title= Yuai Association|publisher= Yuai Association|accessdate= 2 May 2013[/tpl]) with their sister Kazuko,[tpl]cite web |url= http://yuaikyoukai.com/soshiki.html|title= 役員|publisher= Yuai Association|accessdate= 2 May 2013[/tpl] founded by their grandfather Ichirō who became the first president of the former organization in 1953.
