CATEGORIES: Reptiles, Classes (biology)

Reptiles, the class Reptilia, are an evolutionary grade of animals, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, lizards and tuatara, as well as many extinct groups. A reptile is any amniote (a tetrapod whose egg has an additional membrane, originally to allow them to lay eggs on land) that is neither a mammal nor a bird. Unlike mammals, birds, and certain extinct reptiles, living reptiles have scales or scutes (rather than fur or feathers) and are cold-blooded. Advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature regard the traditional category 'Reptilia' to be invalid, because not all descendants of a common ancestor are included. However, in practice, these non-cladistic classifications, such as reptile, fish, and amphibian, remain in use by some biologists, especially in popular books written for a general audience. The historically combined study of reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology.
The earliest known reptiles originated around 315 million years ago during the Carboniferous period, having evolved from advanced reptile-like amphibians that became increasingly adapted to life on dry land. Some early examples include the lizard-like Hylonomus, Casineria and possibly Westlothiana, although the latter may be an advanced land-dwelling amphibian. In addition to the living reptiles, there are many diverse groups that are now extinct, in some cases due to mass extinction events. In particular, the K–Pg extinction wiped out the pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, ornithischians, and sauropods, as well as many species of theropods (e.g. tyrannosaurs and dromaeosaurids), crocodyliforms, and squamates (e.g. mosasaurids).
Modern reptiles inhabit every continent with the exception of Antarctica. Several living subgroups are recognized:
Although they have scutes on their feet and lay eggs, birds have historically been excluded from the reptiles. They, therefore, do not appear on the list above. However, as some reptiles are more closely related to birds than they are to other reptiles — crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards — cladistic writers who prefer a more unified (monophyletic) grouping usually also include the birds, which include over 10,000 species.[tpl]cite book |last=Gauthier |first=J.A. |coauthors=Kluge, A.G.; and Rowe, T. |year=1988 |chapter=The early evolution of the Amniota |title=The Phylogeny and Classification of the Tetrapods |volume=1 |editors=Benton, M.J.

Reptiles are tetrapod vertebrates, either having four limbs or, like snakes, being descended from four-limbed ancestors. Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have an aquatic larval stage. Most reptiles are oviparous (egg-laying), although several species of squamates are viviparous, as were some extinct aquatic clades[tpl]cite journal |last=Sander |first=P. Martin. |year=2012 |title=Reproduction in early amniotes |journal=Science |volume=337|issue=6096 |pages=806–808 |doi=10.1126/science.1224301[/tpl] — the fetus develops within the mother, contained in a placenta rather than an eggshell. As amniotes, reptile eggs are surrounded by membranes for protection and transport, which adapt them to reproduction on dry land. Many of the viviparous species feed their fetuses through various forms of placenta analogous to those of mammals, with some providing initial care for their hatchlings. Extant reptiles range in size from a tiny gecko, Sphaerodactylus ariasae, which can grow up to [tpl]convert|17|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] to the saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus porosus, which may reach [tpl]convert|6|m|ft|1|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and weigh over [tpl]convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Classification==

===History of classification===

====Linnaeus and the 18th century====

The reptiles were, from the outset of classification, grouped with the amphibians. Linnaeus, working from species-poor Sweden, where the common adder and grass snake are often found hunting in water, included all reptiles and amphibians in class "III – Amphibia" in his Systema Naturæ.[tpl]cite book|last=Linnaeus |first=Carolus |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae :secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. |publisher=Holmiae (Laurentii Salvii) |year=1758 |url=http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/542 |accessdate=2008-09-22 |language=Latin |edition=10th[/tpl]
The terms "reptile" and "amphibian" were largely interchangeable, "reptile" (from Latin repere, "to creep") being preferred by the French.Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th ed. (1878). original text
Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti was the first to formally use the term "Reptilia" for an expanded selection of reptiles and amphibians basically similar to that of Linnaeus.Laurenti, J.N. (1768): Specimen Medicum, Exhibens Synopsin Reptilium Emendatam cum Experimentis circa Venena. Facsimile, showing the mixed composition of his Reptilia Today, the two groups are still commonly treated under the same heading as herptiles.

===="Antediluvian monsters"====

It was not until the beginning of the 19th century that it became clear that reptiles and amphibians are, in fact, quite different animals, and Pierre André Latreille erected the class Batracia (1825) for the latter, dividing the tetrapods into the four familiar classes of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals.Latreielle, P.A. (1804): Nouveau Dictionnaire à Histoire Naturelle, xxiv., cited in Latreille's Familles naturelles du règne animal, exposés succinctement et dans un ordre analytique, 1825
The British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley made Latreille's definition popular and, together with Richard Owen, expanded Reptilia to include the various fossil "antediluvian monsters", including dinosaurs and the mammal-like (synapsid) Dicynodon he helped describe. This was not the only possible classification scheme: In the Hunterian lectures delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1863, Huxley grouped the vertebrates into mammals, sauroids, and ichthyoids (the latter containing the fishes and amphibians). He subsequently proposed the names of Sauropsida and Ichthyopsida for the two.Huxley, T.H. (1863): The Structure and Classification of the Mammalia. Hunterian lectures, presented in Medical Times and Gazette, 1863. original text
In 1866, Haeckel demonstrated that vertebrates could be divided based on their reproductive strategies, and that reptiles, birds, and mammals were united by the amniotic egg.
The terms "Sauropsida" ("lizard faces") and "Theropsida" ("beast faces") were used again in 1916 by E.S. Goodrich to distinguish between lizards, birds, and their relatives on the one hand (Sauropsida) and mammals and their extinct relatives (Theropsida) on the other. Goodrich supported this division by the nature of the hearts and blood vessels in each group, and other features, such as the structure of the forebrain. According to Goodrich, both lineages evolved from an earlier stem group, Protosauria ("first lizards") in which he included some animals today considered reptile-like amphibians, as well as early reptiles.[tpl]cite journal|last=Goodrich|first=E.S.|title=On the classification of the Reptilia|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume= 89B|pages=261–276|year=1916|doi=10.1098/rspb.1916.0012|issue=615[/tpl]
In 1956, D.M.S. Watson observed that the first two groups diverged very early in reptilian history, so he divided Goodrich's Protosauria between them. He also reinterpreted Sauropsida and Theropsida to exclude birds and mammals, respectively. Thus his Sauropsida included Procolophonia, Eosuchia, Millerosauria, Chelonia (turtles), Squamata (lizards and snakes), Rhynchocephalia, Crocodilia, "thecodonts" (paraphyletic basal Archosauria), non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and sauropterygians.[tpl]cite journal|last=Watson|first=D.M.S.|coauthors=|year=1957|title=On Millerosaurus and the early history of the sauropsid reptiles|url=|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B, Biological Sciences|volume=240|issue=673|pages=325–400|doi=10.1098/rstb.1957.0003[/tpl]
In the late 19th century, a number of definitions of Reptilia were offered. The traits listed by Lydekker in 1896, for example, include a single occipital condyle, a jaw joint formed by the quadrate and articular bones, and certain characteristics of the vertebrae.[tpl]cite book |title=The Royal Natural History: Reptiles and Fishes | pages=2–3|last=Lydekker |first=Richard |year=1896 |publisher=Frederick Warne & Son |location=London |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dFMjAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Lydekker+Royal+Natural+History+Reptilia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RmZvT5L3IeHf0QHX6YDLBg&sqi=2&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] The animals singled out by these formulations, the amniotes other than the mammals and the birds, are still those considered reptiles today.

====Skull openings in 20th-century classification====

The synapsid/sauropsid division supplemented another approach, one that split the reptiles into four subclasses based on the number and position of temporal fenestrae, openings in the sides of the skull behind the eyes. This classification was initiated by Henry Fairfield Osborn and elaborated and made popular by Romer's classic Vertebrate Paleontology.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Osborn | first1 = H.F. | authorlink = Henry Fairfield Osborn | year = 1903 | title = The Reptilian subclasses Diapsida and Synapsida and Early History of Diaptosauria | url = http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/handle/2246/5739 | journal = Memoirs of the American Museum of Natural History | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 451–507 [/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Romer|first=A.S.|coauthors=|authorlink=|title=Vertebrate Paleontology|edition=|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=|year=1933|isbn=|series=[/tpl], 3rd ed., 1966. Those four subclasses were:
The composition of Euryapsida was uncertain. Ichthyosaurs were, at times, considered to have arisen independently of the other euryapsids, and given the older name Parapsida. Parapsida was later discarded as a group for the most part (ichthyosaurs being classified as incertae sedis or with Euryapsida). However, the scheme with four (or three if Euryapsida is sunk into Diapsida) subclasses remained more or less universal for non-specialist work throughout the 20th century. It has largely been abandoned among recent researchers; in particular, the anapsid condition has been found to occur so variably among unrelated groups that it is not now considered a useful distinction.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Tsuji |first1=L.A. |last2=Müller |first2=J. |year=2009 |title=Assembling the history of the Parareptilia: phylogeny, diversification, and a new definition of the clade |journal=Fossil Record |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=71–81 |doi=10.1002/mmng.200800011[/tpl]

====Phylogenetics and modern definition====

By the early 21st century, vertebrate paleontologists were beginning to adopt phylogenetic taxonomy, in which all groups are defined in such a way as to be monophyletic; that is, groups include all descendants of a particular ancestor. The reptiles as historically defined are paraphyletic, since they exclude both birds and mammals. These respectively evolved from dinosaurs and from early therapsids, which were both traditionally called reptiles.[tpl]cite journal |last=Brysse|first=K.|year=2008|title=From weird wonders to stem lineages: the second reclassification of the Burgess Shale fauna |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Biological and Biomedical Sciences|volume=39|issue=3|pages=298–313 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2008.06.004 |pmid=18761282 [/tpl] Birds are more closely related to crocodilians than the latter are to the rest of extant reptiles. Colin Tudge wrote:
 Mammals are a clade, and therefore the cladists are happy to acknowledge the traditional taxon Mammalia; and birds, too, are a clade, universally ascribed to the formal taxon Aves. Mammalia and Aves are, in fact, subclades within the grand clade of the Amniota. But the traditional class Reptilia is not a clade. It is just a section of the clade Amniota: the section that is left after the Mammalia and Aves have been hived off. It cannot be defined by synapomorphies, as is the proper way. Instead, it is defined by a combination of the features it has and the features it lacks: reptiles are the amniotes that lack fur or feathers. At best, the cladists suggest, we could say that the traditional Reptilia are 'non-avian, non-mammalian amniotes'.[tpl]RefTudgeVariety[/tpl] 
Despite the early proposals for replacing the paraphyletic Reptilia for a monophyletic Sauropsida which includes birds, that term was never adopted widely or, when it was, applied consistently.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Modesto | first1 = S.P. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = J.S. | year = 2004 | title = The phylogenetic definition of Reptilia | url = http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/5/815.full | journal = Systematic Biology | pmid = 15545258 | volume = 53 | issue = 5| pages = 815–821 | doi = 10.1080/10635150490503026 [/tpl] When Sauropsida was used, it often had the same content or even the same definition as Reptilia. In 1988 Jacques Gauthier proposed a cladistic definition of Reptilia as a monophyletic node-based crown group containing turtles, lizards and snakes, crocodilians, and birds, their common ancestor and all its descendants. Because the actual relationship of turtles to other reptiles was not yet well understood at this time, Gauthier's definition came to be considered inadequate. A variety of other definitions were proposed by other scientists in the years following Gauthier's paper. The first such new definition, which attempted to adhere to the standards of the PhyloCode, was published by Modesto and Anderson in 2004. Modesto and Anderson reviewed the many previous definitions and proposed a modified definition, which they intended to retain most traditional content of the group while keeping it stable and monophyletic. They defined Reptilia as all amniotes closer to Lacerta agilis and Crocodylus niloticus than to Homo sapiens. This stem-based definition is equivalent to the more common definition of Sauropsida, which Modesto and Anderson synonymized with Reptilia, since the latter is more well known and more frequently used. Unlike most previous definitions of Reptilia, however, Modesto and Anderson's definition includes birds, as there is no other way to establish a monophyletic clade that includes both lizards and crocodiles.

===Taxonomy===

Classification to order level, after Benton, 2005.[tpl]cite book|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|authorlink=Michael J. Benton|title=Vertebrate Palaeontology|edition=3rd|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd.|location=Oxford|year=2005|isbn=0-632-05637-1|series=[/tpl]This taxonomy does not reflect modern molecular evidence, which places turtles within Diapsida.

===Phylogeny===

The cladogram presented here illustrates the "family tree" of reptiles, and follows a simplified version of the relationships found by Laurin and Gauthier (1996), presented as part of the Tree of Life Web Project,Laurin, M. and Gauthier, J.A.

===The position of turtles===

The placement of turtles has historically been highly variable. Classically, turtles were considered to be related to the primitive anapsid reptiles. Molecular work has usually placed turtles within the diapsids. So far three turtle genomes have been sequenced.Gilbert SF, Corfe I (2013) Turtle origins: picking up speed. Dev Cell. 2013 May 28;25(4) 326-328. [tpl]DOI|10.1016/j.devcel.2013.05.011[/tpl] The results place turtles as a sister clade to the archosaurs, the group that includes crocodiles, dinosaurs, and birds.

==Evolutionary history==

===Origin of the reptiles===

The origin of the reptiles lies about 310–320 million years ago, in the steaming swamps of the late Carboniferous period, when the first reptiles evolved from advanced reptiliomorph labyrinthodonts.[tpl]cite journal|last=Laurin|first=M.|coauthors=Reisz, R. R.|year=1995|title=A reevaluation of early amniote phylogeny|url=|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=113|issue=2|pages=165–223|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1995.tb00932.x[/tpl] (abstract[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl])
The oldest known animal that may have been an amniote, i.e. a primitive reptile rather than an advanced amphibian, is Casineria (though it may have been a temnospondyl amphibian).R. L. Paton, T. R.

It was a small, lizard-like animal, about [tpl]convert|20|to|30|cm[/tpl] long, with numerous sharp teeth indicating an insectivorous diet.[tpl]cite book |editor=Palmer, D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Animals|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|page= 62|isbn= 1-84028-152-9[/tpl] Other examples include Westlothiana (for the moment considered a reptiliomorph amphibian rather than a true amniote)[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Ruta | first1 = M. | last2 = Coates | first2 = M.I. | last3 = Quicke | first3 = D.L.J. | year = 2003 | title = Early tetrapod relationships revisited | url = http://pondside.uchicago.edu/oba/faculty/coates/5.RutCoaQuick2003.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Biological Review | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 251–345 | doi=10.1017/S1464793102006103[/tpl] and Paleothyris, both of similar build and presumably similar habit.

===Rise of the reptiles===

Earliest reptiles were largely overshadowed by bigger labyrinthodont amphibians, such as Cochleosaurus, and remained a small, inconspicuous part of the fauna until the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. & Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | issue=12[/tpl] This sudden collapse affected several large groups. Amphibians were particularly devastated, while reptiles fared better, being ecologically adapted to the drier conditions that followed. Amphibians must return to water to lay eggs; in contrast, reptiles – whose eggs possess a shell that allows them to be laid on land – were better adapted to the new conditions. Reptiles acquired new niches at a faster rate than before the collapse and at a much faster rate than amphibians. They acquired new feeding strategies including herbivory and carnivory, previously only having been insectivores and piscivores. From this point forward, reptiles dominated communities and had a greater diversity than amphibians, setting the stage for the Mesozoic (known as the Age of Reptiles).[tpl]cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204[/tpl] One of the best known early reptiles is Mesosaurus, a genus from the early Permian that had returned to water, feeding on fish.

===Anapsids, synapsids, diapsids and sauropsids===

It was traditionally assumed that the first reptiles retained an anapsid skull inherited from their amphibian ancestors.Coven, R (2000): History of Life. Blackwell science, Oxford, UK. p 154 from Google Books This type of skull has a skull roof with only holes for the nostrils, eyes and a pineal eye.Romer, A.S. & T.S. Parsons. 1977. The Vertebrate Body. 5th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. (6th ed. 1985) The discoveries of synapsid-like openings (see below) in the skull roof of the skulls of several members of Parareptilia (the clade containing most of reptiles traditionally referred to as anapsids), including lanthanosuchoids, millerettids, bolosaurids, some nycteroleterids, some procolophonoids and at least some mesosaurs[tpl]cite journal |author=Juan C.

These animals are traditionally referred to as anapsids, and form a paraphyletic basic stock from which other groups evolved. Very shortly after the reptiles appeared, a lineage called Synapsida split off, characterized by a temporal opening in the skull behind each eye to give room for the jaw muscle to move. These are the "mammal-like reptiles" that later gave rise to the true mammals.van Tuninen, M. & Hadly, E.A. (2004): Error in Estimation of Rate and Time Inferred from the Early Amniote Fossil Record and Avian Molecular Clocks. Journal of Mulecular Biology, no 59: pp 267-276 PDF Soon after, another group evolved a similar trait, this time with a double opening behind each eye, earning them the name Diapsida ("two arches"). The function of the holes in these groups was to lighten the skull and give room for the jaw muscles to move, allowing for a more powerful bite. Diapsids and the anapsid reptiles back to the last common ancestor of diapsids and synapsids are classed as the "true reptiles", Sauropsida.
Turtles have been traditionally believed to be surviving reptilian anapsids, on the basis of their skull structure.[tpl]cite book|last=Benton|first=M.

===Permian reptiles===

With the close of the Carboniferous, reptiles became the dominant tetrapod fauna. While the terrestrial reptiliomorph labyrinthodonts still existed, the synapsids evolved the first truly terrestrial megafauna (giant animals) in the form of pelycosaurs, such as Edaphosaurus and the carnivorous Dimetrodon. In the mid-Permian period, the climate became drier, resulting in a change of fauna: The pelycosaurs were replaced by the therapsids.Colbert, E.H. & Morales, M. (2001): Colbert's Evolution of the Vertebrates: A History of the Backboned Animals Through Time. 4th edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York — ISBN 978-0-471-38461-8.
The anapsid reptiles, whose massive skull roofs had no postorbital holes, continued and flourished throughout the Permian. The pareiasaurs reached giant proportions in the late Permian, eventually disappearing at the close of the period (the turtles being possible survivors).
Early in the period, the diapsid reptiles split into two main lineages, the archosaurs (forebears of crocodiles and dinosaurs) and the lepidosaurs (predecessors of modern snakes, lizards, and tuatara). Both groups remained lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian.

===The Mesozoic era, the "Age of Reptiles"===

The close of the Permian saw the greatest mass extinction known (see the Permian–Triassic extinction event), a prolonged event due to the accumulation of at least two distinct extinction pulses.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759.full.pdf | author=Sahney, S. and Benton, M.J. | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65|format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898[/tpl] Most of the earlier anapsid/synapsid megafauna disappeared, being replaced by the archosauromorph diapsids. The archosaurs were characterized by elongated hind legs and an erect pose, the early forms looking somewhat like long-legged crocodiles. The archosaurs became the dominant group during the Triassic period, though it took 30 million years before their diversity was as great as the animals that lived in the Permian. Archosaurs developed into the well-known dinosaurs and pterosaurs, as well as crocodiles and phytosaurs. Since reptiles, first rauisuchians and then dinosaurs, dominated the Mesozoic era, the interval is popularly known as the "Age of Reptiles". The dinosaurs also developed smaller forms, including the feather-bearing smaller theropods. In the mid-Jurassic period, these gave rise to the first birds.
The sister group to Archosauromorpha is Lepidosauromorpha, containing squamates and rhynchocephalians, as well as their fossil relatives. Lepidosauromorpha contained at least one major group of the Mesozoic sea reptiles: the mosasaurs, which emerged during the Cretaceous period. The phylogenetic placement of other main groups of fossil sea reptiles – the ichthyopterygians (including ichthyosaurs) and the sauropterygians, which evolved in the early Triassic – is more controversial. Different authors linked these groups either to lepidosauromorphsGauthier J. A. (1994): The diversification of the amniotes. In: D. R. Prothero and R. M. Schoch (ed.) Major Features of Vertebrate Evolution: 129-159. Knoxville, Tennessee: The Paleontological Society. or to archosauromorphs,[tpl]Cite journal|author=John W.

The therapsids came under increasing pressure from the dinosaurs in the early Mesozoic and developed into increasingly smaller and more nocturnal forms, the mammals being the only survivors of the line by the late Cretaceous.

===Cenozoic era===

The close of the Cretaceous period saw the demise of the Mesozoic era reptilian megafauna (see the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event). Of the large marine reptiles, only sea turtles were left; and of the non-marine large reptiles, only the semi-aquatic crocodiles and broadly similar Champsosaurus survived the extinction, with the latter becoming extinct in the Miocene.[tpl]cite journal |last=Evans |first=Susan E. |coauthors=and Klembara, Jozef |year=2005 |title=A choristoderan reptile (Reptilia: Diapsida) from the Lower Miocene of northwest Bohemia (Czech Republic) |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=171–184 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2005)0250171:ACRRDF2.0.CO;2 |issn=0272-4634 [/tpl] Of the great host of dinosaurs dominating the Mesozoic, only the small feathered birds survived. This dramatic extinction pattern at the end of the “Age of Reptiles” led into the “Age of Mammals”. Mammals and birds filled the empty niches left behind by the reptilian megafauna and, while reptile diversification slowed, bird and mammal diversification took an exponential turn.
After the extinction of most archosaur and marine reptile lines end of the Cretaceous, reptile diversification continued throughout the Cenozoic, with squamates undergoing a greater radiation than they did in the Mesozoic. Today, squamates make up the majority of living reptiles (> 95%), most species being lizards.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.reptile-database.org/ | title = The Reptile Database | accessdate = 9 Jan 2012[/tpl] Approximately 10,000 extant species of reptiles are known, about equal to birds, and almost twice compared with about 5,700 species of mammals alive today (excluding domesticated species).[tpl]cite web|title=Numbers of threatened species by major groups of organisms (1996–2012)|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/documents/summarystatistics/2012_1_RL_Stats_Table_1.pdf|work=IUCN Red List, 2010|publisher=IUCN|accessdate=30 January 2013[/tpl]

==Systems==

===Circulation===

Most reptiles have a three-chambered heart consisting of two atria, one variably partitioned ventricle, and two aortas that lead to the systemic circulation. The degree of mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the three-chambered heart varies depending on the species and physiological state. Under different conditions, deoxygenated blood can be shunted back to the body or oxygenated blood can be shunted back to the lungs. This variation in blood flow has been hypothesized to allow more effective thermoregulation and longer diving times for aquatic species, but has not been shown to be a fitness advantage.[tpl]cite journal |last=Hicks |first=James |year=2002 |title=The Physiological and Evolutionary Significance of Cardiovascular Shunting Patterns in Reptiles |journal=News in Physiological Sciences |volume=17 |pages=241–245 |pmid=12433978[/tpl]
There are some exceptions to the general physiology. For instance, crocodilians have an anatomically four-chambered heart, but also have two systemic aortas and are therefore capable of bypassing only their pulmonary circulation.[tpl]cite journal |last=Axelsson |first=Michael |coauthors=Craig E. Franklin |year=1997 |title=From anatomy to angioscopy: 164 years of crocodilian cardiovascular research, recent advances, and speculations |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A |volume=188 |issue=1 |pages=51–62 |doi=10.1016/S0300-9629(96)00255-1[/tpl] Also, some snake and lizard species (e.g., pythons and monitor lizards) have three-chambered hearts that become functionally four-chambered hearts during contraction. This is made possible by a muscular ridge that subdivides the ventricle during ventricular diastole and completely divides it during ventricular systole. Because of this ridge, some of these squamates are capable of producing ventricular pressure differentials that are equivalent to those seen in mammalian and avian hearts.[tpl]cite journal | last=Wang | first=Tobias | coauthors=Altimiras, Jordi; Klein, Wilfried; Axelsson, Michael | title=Ventricular haemodynamics in Python molurus: separation of pulmonary and systemic pressures | journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology | year=2003 | volume=206 | pages=4242–4245 | doi=10.1242/jeb.00681 | pmid=14581594 | issue=Pt 23[/tpl]

===Metabolism===

Except for some possibly- warm-blooded extinct groups (such as some subgroups of stem-birds, crocodilian ancestors[tpl]cite journal |author=Roger S. Seymour, Christina L. Bennett‐Stamper, Sonya D. Johnston, David R. Carrier and Gordon C. Grigg |year=2004 |title=Evidence for endothermic ancestors of crocodiles at the stem of archosaur evolution |journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology |volume=77 |issue=6 |pages=1051–1067 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/422766 |doi=10.1086/422766[/tpl] and Mesozoic marine reptiles), reptiles exhibit some form of cold-bloodedness (i.e. some mix of poikilothermy, ectothermy, and bradymetabolism) so that they have limited physiological means of keeping the body temperature constant and often rely on external sources of heat. Due to a less stable core temperature than birds and mammals, reptilian biochemistry requires enzymes capable of maintaining efficiency over a greater range of temperatures than in the case for warm-blooded animals. The optimum body temperature range varies with species, but is typically below that of warm-blooded animals; for many lizards, it falls in the 24°–35°C (75°–95°F) range,Huey, R.B. & Bennett, A.F. (1987):Phylogenetic studies of coadaptation: Preferred temperatures versus optimal performance temperatures of lizards. Evolution No. 4, vol 5: pages 1098-1115 PDF while extreme heat-adapted species, like the American desert iguana Dipsosaurus dorsalis, can have optimal physiological temperatures in the mammalian range, between 35° and 40°C (95° and 104°F).Huey, R.B. (1982): Temperature, physiology, and the ecology of reptiles. Side 25-91. In Gans, C. & Pough, F.H. (red), Biology of the Reptili No. 12, Physiology (C). Academic Press, London.artikkel While the optimum temperature is often encountered when the animal is active, the low basal metabolism makes body temperature drop rapidly when the animal is inactive.
As in all animals, reptilian muscle action produces heat. In large reptiles, like leatherback turtles, the low surface-to-volume ratio allows this metabolically produced heat to keep the animals warmer than their environment although they do not have a warm-blooded metabolism.Spotila J.R. & Standora, E.A. (1985) Environmental constraints on the thermal energetics of sea turtles. 'Copeia 3: 694–702 This form of homeothermy is called gigantothermy; it has been suggested as having been common in large dinosaurs and other extinct large-bodied reptiles.Paladino, F.V.; Spotila, J.R & Dodson, P.

The benefit of a low resting metabolism is that it requires far less fuel to sustain bodily functions. By using temperature variations in their surroundings, or by remaining cold when they do not need to move, reptiles can save considerable amounts of energy compared to endothermic animals of the same size.Campbell, N.A. & Reece, J.B. (2006): Outlines & Highlights for Essential Biology. Academic Internet Publishers. 396 pages ISBN 0-8053-7473-6 A crocodile needs from a tenth to a fifth of the food necessary for a lion of the same weight and can live half a year without eating.Garnett, S.T. (2009): Metabolism and survival of fasting Estuarine crocodiles. Journal of Zoology, No 208, vol 4: pages 493 - 502 Lower food requirements and adaptive metabolisms allow reptiles to dominate the animal life in regions where net calorie availability is too low to sustain large-bodied mammals and birds.
It is generally assumed that reptiles are unable to produce the sustained high energy output necessary for long distance chases or flying.Willmer, P., Stone, G. & Johnston, I.A. (2000): Environmental physiology of animals. Blackwell Science Ltd, London. 644 pages ISBN 0-632-03517-X Higher energetic capacity might have been responsible for the evolution of warm-bloodedness in birds and mammals.[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.493968 | last1 = Bennett | first1 = A. | last2 = Ruben | first2 = J. | author8 = Bennett, A., and Ruben, J | year = 1979 | title = Endothermy and Activity in Vertebrates | journal = Science | volume = 206 | pages = 649–654 | postscript =  | pmid=493968 | issue = 4419[/tpl] However, investigation of correlations between active capacity and thermophysiology show a weak relationship.[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/303323 | author = Farmer, C.G. | year = 2000 | title = Parental Care: The Key to Understanding Endothermy and Other Convergent Features in Birds and Mammals | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 155 | issue = 3 | pages = 326–334 | pmid = 10718729 | postscript = [/tpl] Most extant reptiles are carnivores with a sit-and-wait feeding strategy, and whether reptiles are cold blooded due to their ecology or because their metabolism is a result of their ecology is not clear.

===Respiration===

====Reptilian lungs====

All reptiles breathe using lungs. Aquatic turtles have developed more permeable skin, and some species have modified their cloaca to increase the area for gas exchange.Orenstein, 2001 Even with these adaptations, breathing is never fully accomplished without lungs. Lung ventilation is accomplished differently in each main reptile group. In squamates, the lungs are ventilated almost exclusively by the axial musculature. This is also the same musculature that is used during locomotion. Because of this constraint, most squamates are forced to hold their breath during intense runs. Some, however, have found a way around it. Varanids, and a few other lizard species, employ buccal pumping as a complement to their normal "axial breathing." This allows the animals to completely fill their lungs during intense locomotion, and thus remain aerobically active for a long time. Tegu lizards are known to possess a proto-diaphragm, which separates the pulmonary cavity from the visceral cavity. While not actually capable of movement, it does allow for greater lung inflation, by taking the weight of the viscera off the lungs.(Klein et al., 2003)
Crocodilians actually have a muscular diaphragm that is analogous to the mammalian diaphragm. The difference is that the muscles for the crocodilian diaphragm pull the pubis (part of the pelvis, which is movable in crocodilians) back, which brings the liver down, thus freeing space for the lungs to expand. This type of diaphragmatic setup has been referred to as the "hepatic piston." The airways bronchia form a number of double tubular chambers within each lung. On inhalation and exhalation air moves through the airways in the same direction, thus creating an unidirectional airflow through the lungs. A similar system is found in birds[tpl]cite journal|last=Farmer|first=CG|coauthors=Sanders, K|title=Unidirectional airflow in the lungs of alligators|journal=Science|year=2010|volume=327|issue=5963|pages=338–340|doi=10.1126/science.1180219|pmid=20075253[/tpl] and monitor lizards.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/nature12871[/tpl]

====Turtles and tortoises====

How turtles and tortoises breathe has been the subject of much study. To date, only a few species have been studied thoroughly enough to get an idea of how turtles breathe. The results indicate that turtles and tortoises have found a variety of solutions to this problem.
The difficulty is that most turtle shells are rigid and do not allow for the type of expansion and contraction that other amniotes use to ventilate their lungs. Some turtles, such as the Indian flapshell (Lissemys punctata), have a sheet of muscle that envelops the lungs. When it contracts, the turtle can exhale. When at rest, the turtle can retract the limbs into the body cavity and force air out of the lungs. When the turtle protracts its limbs, the pressure inside the lungs is reduced, and the turtle can suck air in. Turtle lungs are attached to the inside of the top of the shell (carapace), with the bottom of the lungs attached (via connective tissue) to the rest of the viscera. By using a series of special muscles (roughly equivalent to a diaphragm), turtles are capable of pushing their viscera up and down, resulting in effective respiration, since many of these muscles have attachment points in conjunction with their forelimbs (indeed, many of the muscles expand into the limb pockets during contraction).
Breathing during locomotion has been studied in three species, and they show different patterns. Adult female green sea turtles do not breathe as they crutch along their nesting beaches. They hold their breath during terrestrial locomotion and breathe in bouts as they rest. North American box turtles breathe continuously during locomotion, and the ventilation cycle is not coordinated with the limb movements.[tpl]cite journal | last=Landberg | first=Tobias | coauthors=Mailhot, Jeffrey; Brainerd, Elizabeth| title=Lung ventilation during treadmill locomotion in a terrestrial turtle, Terrapene carolina | journal=Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=206 | issue=19 | year=2003 | pages=3391–3404| doi=10.1242/jeb.00553| pmid=12939371[/tpl] This is because they use their abdominal muscles to breathe during locomotion. The last species to have been studied is the red-eared slider, which also breathes during locomotion, but takes smaller breaths during locomotion than during small pauses between locomotor bouts, indicating that there may be mechanical interference between the limb movements and the breathing apparatus. Box turtles have also been observed to breathe while completely sealed up inside their shells.

====Palate====

Most reptiles lack a secondary palate, meaning that they must hold their breath while swallowing. Crocodilians have evolved a bony secondary palate that allows them to continue breathing while remaining submerged (and protect their brains against damage by struggling prey). Skinks (family Scincidae) also have evolved a bony secondary palate, to varying degrees. Snakes took a different approach and extended their trachea instead. Their tracheal extension sticks out like a fleshy straw, and allows these animals to swallow large prey without suffering from asphyxiation.

===Skin===

Reptilian skin is covered in a horny epidermis, making it watertight and enabling reptiles to live on dry land, in contrast to amphibians. Compared to mammalian skin, that of reptiles is rather thin and lacks the thick dermal layer that produces leather in mammals.Hildebran, M. & Goslow, G. (2001): Analysis of Vertebrate Structure. 5th edition. John Wiley & sons inc, New York. 635 pages ISBN 0-471-29505-1
Exposed parts of reptiles are protected by scales or scutes, sometimes with a bony base, forming armor. In lepidosaurians such as lizards and snakes, the whole skin is covered in overlapping epidermal scales. Such scales were once thought to be typical of the class Reptilia as a whole, but are now known to occur only in lepidosaurians. The scales found in turtles and crocodiles are of dermal, rather than epidermal, origin and are properly termed scutes. In turtles, the body is hidden inside a hard shell composed of fused scutes.
Lacking a thick dermis, reptilian leather is not as strong as mammalian leather. It is used in leather-wares for decorative purposes for shoes, belts and handbags, particularly crocodile skin.

===Excretion===

Excretion is performed mainly by two small kidneys. In diapsids, uric acid is the main nitrogenous waste product; turtles, like mammals, excrete mainly urea. Unlike the kidneys of mammals and birds, reptile kidneys are unable to produce liquid urine more concentrated than their body fluid. This is because they lack a specialized structure called a loop of Henle, which is present in the nephrons of birds and mammals. Because of this, many reptiles use the colon to aid in the reabsorption of water. Some are also able to take up water stored in the bladder. Excess salts are also excreted by nasal and lingual salt glands in some reptiles.

===Digestion===

Most reptiles are insectivorous or carnivorous and have rather simple and comparatively short digestive tracts, meat being fairly simple to break down and digest. Digestion is slower than in mammals, reflecting their lower resting metabolism and their inability to divide and masticate their food.[tpl]cite book|title=Comparative Physiology: Life in Water and on Land|year=1986|publisher=Liviana Press/Springer Verlag|isbn=0387965157|url=http://www.google.no/books?hl=no&lr=&id=zuT5z5cPWhcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA181&dq=reptiles+carnivory+gastric&ots=MHgrO9g5DV&sig=egenLtkWuXaLf17he67k0O8ARSY&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Karasov, W.H.|authorlink=Nutrient requirement and the design and function of guts in fish, reptiles and mammals|editor=Dejours, P., Bolis, L., Taylor, C.R. and Weibel, E.R.|accessdate=1 November 2012|pages=181–191[/tpl] Their poikilotherm metabolism has very low energy requirements, allowing large reptiles like crocodiles and the large constrictors to live from a single large meal for months, digesting it slowly.
While modern reptiles are predominately carnivorous, during the early history of reptiles several groups produced some herbivorous megafauna: in the Paleozoic, the pareiasaurs and the synapsid dicynodonts; and in the Mesozoic several lines of dinosaurs. Today, the turtles are the only predominantly herbivorous reptile group, but several lines of agamas and iguanas have evolved to live wholly or partly on plants.[tpl]cite book|last=King|first=Gillian|title=Reptiles and herbivory|year=1996|publisher=Chapman & Hall|location=London|isbn=0412461102|edition=1st ed.[/tpl]
Herbivorous reptiles face the same problems of mastication as herbivorous mammals but, lacking the complex teeth of mammals, many species swallow rocks and pebbles (so called gastroliths) to aid in digestion: The rocks are washed around in the stomach, helping to grind up plant matter. Fossil gastroliths have been found associated with both ornithopods and sauropods, though whether they actually functioned as a gastric mill in the latter is disputed.[tpl]cite journal|last=Cerda|first=Ignacio A.|title=Gastroliths in An Ornithopod Dinosaur|journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica|date=1 June 2008|volume=53|issue=2|pages=351–355|doi=10.4202/app.2008.0213|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.4202/app.2008.0213|accessdate=1 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Wings|first=O.|coauthors=Sander, P.

===Nerves===

The reptilian nervous system contains the same basic part of the amphibian brain, but the reptile cerebrum and cerebellum are slightly larger. Most typical sense organs are well developed with certain exceptions, most notably the snake's lack of external ears (middle and inner ears are present). There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.curator.org/legacyvmnh/weboflife/kingdom/p_chordata/ClassReptilia/reptiles.htm |title=de beste bron van informatie over cultural institution. Deze website is te koop! |publisher=Curator.org |accessdate=2010-03-16[/tpl] Due to their short cochlea, reptiles use electrical tuning to expand their range of audible frequencies.

====Intelligence====

Reptiles are generally considered less intelligent than mammals and birds. The size of their brain relative to their body is much less than that of mammals, the encephalization quotient being about one tenth of that of mammals,[tpl]cite web|url=http://brainmuseum.org/evolution/paleo/index.html |title=Figure of relative brain size in vertebrates |publisher=Brainmuseum.org |accessdate=2010-03-16[/tpl] though larger reptiles can show more complex brain development. Larger lizards, like the monitors, are known to exhibit complex behavior, including cooperation.King, Dennis & Green, Brian. 1999. Goannas: The Biology of Varanid Lizards. University of New South Wales Press. ISBN 0-86840-456-X, p. 43. Crocodiles have relatively larger brains and show a fairly complex social structure.

===Vision===

Most reptiles are diurnal animals. The vision is typically adapted to daylight conditions, with color vision and more advanced visual depth perception than in amphibians and most mammals. In some species, such as blind snakes, vision is reduced.
Some snakes have extra sets of visual organs (in the loosest sense of the word) in the form of pits sensitive to infrared radiation (heat). Such heat-sensitive pits are particularly well developed in the pit vipers, but are also found in boas and pythons. These pits allow the snakes to sense the body heat of birds and mammals, enabling pit vipers to hunt rodents in the dark.
