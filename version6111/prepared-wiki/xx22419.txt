Long Island City (L.I.C.) is the westernmost residential and commercial neighborhood of the New York City borough of Queens.  L.I.C. is notable for its rapid and ongoing gentrification, its waterfront parks, and its thriving arts community.[tpl]Cite news|title=The Most Livable Neighborhoods in New York |first=Nate |last=Silver |url=http://nymag.com/realestate/neighborhoods/2010/65374/index8.html |magazine=New York |date=April 11, 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-03[/tpl]  L.I.C. has among the highest concentration of art galleries, art institutions, and studio space of any neighborhood in New York City.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://queens.about.com/od/thingtodo/ss/lic_art.htm |title=Long Island City Art Tour |first=John |last=Roleke |work=About.com |accessdate=2010-07-03[/tpl]  The neighborhood is bounded on the north by the Queens neighborhood of Astoria; on the west by the East River; on the east by Hazen Street, 31st Street, and New Calvary Cemetery; and on the south by Newtown Creek, which separates Queens from Greenpoint, Brooklyn. It originally was the seat of government of Newtown Township, and remains the largest neighborhood in Queens. The area is part of Queens Community Board 1 north of the Queensboro (59th Street) Bridge and Queens Community Board 2 south of the Bridge.

==History==

Long Island City, as its name suggests, was formerly a city, created in 1870 from the merger of the Village of Astoria and the hamlets of Ravenswood, Hunters Point, Blissville, Sunnyside, Dutch Kills, Steinway, Bowery Bay and Middleton in Newtown Township. It was a separate city until 1898.[tpl]Cite book|author=Greater Astoria Historical Society |author2=Jackson, Thomas |author3=Melnick, Richard |authorlink=Greater Astoria Historical Society |title=Long Island City |series=Images of America |year=2004 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |location=Charleston, SC |isbn=0-7385-3666-0 |page=10[/tpl]
The last mayor of Long Island City was a notorious Irishman named Patrick Jerome "Battle-Axe" Gleason.
The city surrendered its independence in 1898 to become part of the City of Greater New York. However, Long Island City survives as ZIP code 11101 and ZIP code prefix 111 (with its own main post office) and was formerly a Sectional center facility (SCF). Since 1985, the Greater Astoria Historical Society, a non-profit cultural and historical organization, has been preserving the past and promoting the future of the neighborhoods that are part of historic Long Island City.
The Common Council of Long Island City in 1873 adopted the coat of arms as "emblematical of the varied interest represented by Long Island City." It was designed by George H. Williams, of Ravenswood. The overall composition was inspired by New York City's Coat of Arms. The shield is rich in historic allusion, including Native-American, Dutch, and English symbols.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.astorialic.org/topics/coatofarms_p.php |title=History Topics: LIC Coat of Arms |work=Greater Astoria Historical Society |accessdate=2010-07-03[/tpl]

==Geography==

Long Island City is the eastern terminus of the Queensboro Bridge, also known as the 59th Street Bridge, which is the only non-toll automotive route connecting Queens and Manhattan.
Northwest of the bridge terminus are the Queensbridge Houses, development of the New York City Housing Authority and the largest public housing complex in North America.  Major thoroughfares include Vernon Boulevard, 21st Street, which is mostly industrial and commercial; Queens Boulevard, which leads westward to the bridge and eastward follows New York State Route 25 through Long Island; and the westernmost portion of Northern Boulevard, which becomes Jackson Avenue (the former name of Northern Boulevard) South of Queens Plaza.

==Commercial history and notable buildings==

Long Island City was once home to many factories and bakeries, some of which are finding new uses. The former Silvercup bakery is now home to Silvercup Studios, which produced notable works such as HBO's Sex and the City. The Silvercup sign is visible from the IRT Flushing Line trains going into and out of Queensboro Plaza. The former Sunshine Bakery is now one of the buildings which houses LaGuardia Community College. Other buildings on the campus originally served as the location of the Ford Instrument Company, which was at one time a major producer of precision machines and devices.  Artist Isamu Noguchi converted a photo-engraving plant into a workshop; the site is now the museum, a collection dedicated to his work.
High-rise housing is being built on a former Pepsi-Cola site on the East river. From June 2002 to September 2004, the former Swingline Staplers plant was the temporary headquarters of the Museum of Modern Art. Other former factories in Long Island City include Fisher Electronics and Chiclets Gum. Long Island City's turn-of-the-century district of residential towers, called Queens West, is located along the East River, just north of the main LIRR Long Island City Station. Redevelopment in Queens West reflects the intent to have the area as a major residential area in New York City, with its high-rise residences very close to public transportation, making it convenient for commuters to travel to Manhattan by ferry or subway. The first tower, the 42-floor Citylights, opened in 1998 with an elementary school at the base. Others have been completed since then and more are being planned or under construction.
Today, the most prominent structure, other than Queensboro Bridge, is the community's green skyscraper, the [tpl]convert|658|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] Citicorp Building built in 1989 on Courthouse Square. It is the tallest building on Long Island and in any of the New York City boroughs outside Manhattan.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=116174 |title=Citicorp Building |work=Emporis |accessdate=2007-01-06[/tpl]  Socioeconomic diversity is very visible in Long Island City; the Queensbridge Houses are composed of over 3,000 units, making it the largest public housing complex in North America.
