Citation: The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Second Award of the Silver Star to Major General William Frederic Marquat (ASN: 0-6533), United States Army, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action against the enemy while serving as Anti-Aircraft Officer for the United Nations Command in Korea during the period 29 September to 4 October 1950. Following the restoration of the capital of the Republic of Korea to its President and before the Seoul area was free of enemy activity, General Marquat, completely disregarding his own safety, toured the region by vehicle to obtain first-hand information vital to planning effective anti-aircraft installations necessary to forestall surprise enemy air attacks. Later, in anticipation of increased enemy air activity, General Marquat traveled over terrain harassed by sniper fire and endangered by land mines to inspect anti-aircraft installations. His personal concern for his troops, aggressive actions in ground surveillance, and presence in the forward areas inspired his units to a high degree of efficiency and contributed materially to the United Nations effort in Korea. General Marquat's inspirational courage and his unfaltering devotion to duty as a leader upholds the highest traditions of the military service.
