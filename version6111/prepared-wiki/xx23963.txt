Balkenende resides with his wife, Dr Bianca Hoogendijk, and his daughter, Amelie, in Capelle aan den IJssel, a suburb of Rotterdam. During his tenure as Prime Minister, he used the Catshuis, the formal residency of the Prime Minister. 

==Early political career==

He began his career on the staff of the research institute of the CDA and as a city councilman in Amstelveen. In 1992 he received his PhD with a thesis on "Governance regulation and social organisations" (Overheidsregelgeving en maatschappelijke organisaties), a work strongly inspired by the Communitarian ideas of Amitai Etzioni.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.progressive-governance.net/uploadedFiles/Articles/Becker%20and%20Cuperus%20article(1).pdf | title = The Political Center under Pressure: Elections in the Netherlands |format=PDF[/tpl] One year later in 1993, he became an extraordinary professor of Christian-Social Thought at the Free University of Amsterdam.
Balkenende first entered the House of Representatives on 19 May 1998 while the CDA was in opposition. He became the CDA's financial spokesman and was also involved with social affairs, justice, and domestic affairs. In this role he advocated a substantial reduction of the national debt and sound public finances.
He was elected Chairman of the CDA parliamentary fraction on 1 October 2001, succeeding Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. On 3 November 2001, he was appointed lijsttrekker for the CDA in the tumultuous May 2002 parliamentary elections. These elections restored the CDA's former position as the largest political party in the Dutch parliament.

==Prime Minister==

Balkenende has been prime minister of four successive cabinets.

===Balkenende I===

On 4 July 2002 Queen Beatrix asked Balkenende to form a new government after the general elections following the resignation of Prime Minister Wim Kok. This cabinet is known as Balkenende I. The coalition cabinet included the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) party, whose leader (Pim Fortuyn) was assassinated just days before the election. It collapsed after just 87 days in office because of internal conflicts within the LPF that destabilised the government.

===Balkenende II===

After early elections in 2003 Balkenende formed his second government with: Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the progressive liberal D66. Once again leader of a centre-right coalition, Balkenende's policies centred around reform of the Dutch public services, social security, pre-pension facilities, public health, reducing crime, a tough immigration policy and historically large cuts in public spending. The measures gave rise to large public anger and bad results in opinion polls for his CDA party. While his party remained the largest Dutch delegation in the European Parliament after the European Elections, beating the general expectation of a huge loss in parliamentary seats, the party suffered strong losses during Dutch municipal elections of 2006, losing their position as the largest party in many municipalities. Despite his unpopularity among Dutch voters (polls in 2006 showed that only 26â€“33% of the voters had confidence in him as prime minister), his position as leader of the CDA remained stable. In the beginning of 2006, some CDA members tried to replace Balkenende as leader with minister Cees Veerman. Veerman did not accept this and offered his support to Balkenende. Balkenende's popularity recovered since then, surpassing that of his main competitor Wouter Bos in the autumn of 2006. By then, 53% preferred Balkenende as Prime Minister while 40% preferred Bos.[tpl]nl icon[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Balkenende als premier populairder dan Bos|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/nieuws/politiek/nieuwsbericht/asp/artnr/114307/index.html|publisher=Elsevier|date=10 September 2006[/tpl] This switch in public opinion is sometimes explained by the steady recovery of the Dutch economy during the last year of his administration and the positive effects of the reformed policy of the Balkenende cabinet, combined with declining confidence in Bos as a good alternative for the position of prime-minister.
On 1 July 2004 Balkenende took up the rotating presidency of the European Union.

===Balkenende III===

On 30 June 2006 D66, the smallest coalition party, withdrew its support of the government over the way immigration minister Rita Verdonk had handled the crisis around the naturalization of Dutch MP Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Balkenende resigned for the second time as Prime Minister, announced early elections and presented his third government a week later. This rump cabinet, formed of a minority coalition of CDA and VVD, stayed in office until the elections of 22 November 2006.

===Balkenende IV===

Though his old coalition partners VVD and D66 fared badly in the parliamentary elections of 2006, Balkenende managed to defend the dominant position of his CDA. Needing alternative coalition partners to form a new majority government, he formed a social-Christian coalition with the Dutch Labour Party (PVDA) and the orthodox-Protestant ChristianUnion. This Fourth Balkenende cabinet is a coalition cabinet of the Netherlands, formed by Balkenende, who was appointed formateur by Queen Beatrix on 9 February 2007.[tpl]nl[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nos.nl/nos/artikelen/2007/02/art000001C74C011F6335E9.html | title = Balkenende benoemd tot formateur | date = 9 February 2007 | publisher = NOS.nl[/tpl] His cabinet was announced on 13 February and was scheduled to be in office until 2011, but it fell in the early morning of 20 February 2010 as the result of disagreement between the majority of the parliament and the coalition partners CDA and PvdA over the extension of the Dutch ISAF-mission in Afghanistan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/dutch-government-falls-over-afghanistan-mission|title=Dutch government falls over Afghanistan mission|last=Tyler|first=John|date=20 February 2010|publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|accessdate=20 February 2010[/tpl] In contrast to the formation of a new caretaker cabinet with full responsibility (Balkenende III after the fall of Balkenende II), Balkenende IV continued as a demissionary cabinet, a caretaker cabinet with limited responsibility.

==2010 Election and resignation==

Despite serious criticism by former prime ministers from the CDA, Balkenende was the Christian Democratic Appeal Lijsttrekker for the Dutch general election of 2010.[tpl]nl icon[/tpl] Balkenende weer lijsttrekker CDA
Balkenende raised mild controversy during his campaign for the 2010 Dutch elections. While appearing in a television show, Balkenende was asked by a female presenter what parties he would most likely form a coalition with. Balkenende first gave evasive answers, then when asked again by the presenter, responded saying "U kijkt zo lief" (English: "You look so cute"). The comment was regarded as sexist and criticized by several people, including Opzij chief-editor Margriet van der Linden and GroenLinks leader Femke Halsema (who stated that "prime minister deserves a knee to the groin" (in Dutch: "een knietje verdient")).[tpl]nl[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nd.nl/artikelen/2010/mei/27/balkenende-excuseert-zich-voor-u-kijkt-zo-lief- | title=Balkenende excuseert zich voor 'u kijkt zo lief' | date = 27 May 2010 | publisher = Nederlands Dagblad[/tpl] Balkenende apologized for the comment later.[tpl]nl[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nrcnext.nl/blog/2010/05/27/wat-zeg-je-terug-op-u-kijkt-zo-lief/ | title =Wat zeg je terug op "U kijkt zo lief"? | date = 27 May 2010 | publisher = NRC Next[/tpl]
On 9 June 2010, Balkenende resigned his position as leader of the CDA as well as his seat in the newly elected parliament, taking political responsibility for the CDA's disappointing election results in the 2010 general election.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/6906044/__Balkenende_weg_als_CDA-leider__.html?sn=binnenland,buitenland | author= De Telegraaf | title= Balkenende weg als CDA-leider | accessdate= 2010-06-09[/tpl]

==Other issues==

In 2004, during his second cabinet, Balkenende was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis. He was treated through surgical debridement and made a full recovery after several weeks in hospital.
On 4 June 2005, the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel De Gucht said in the Flemish newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws (The Latest News) that "Balkenende is a mix of Harry Potter and a petty rigid bourgeois mentality". This comparison caused a small diplomatic controversy, and the Belgian ambassador had to apologise to Ben Bot, the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4613087.stm | title = Belgian Potter jibe upsets Dutch | date = 6 June 2005 | publisher = BBC News[/tpl] Retired deputy prime minister Hans Wiegel commented he preferred Harry Potter to the Manneken Pis.
Balkenende has a close relationship with the Dutch people from Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles. He has visited several Keti Koti celebrations in recent years.
He is a member of the Calvinist Protestant Church in the Netherlands.
