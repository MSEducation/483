==History==

===Debut===

WPS started as Word Processing System under DOS in 1988 by then Hong Kong based Kingsun, specifically for assisting Chinese paper work in electronic automation. WPS maintained an enormous user base throughout the late 1980s to mid-1990s before Microsoft Word 95 and Windows 95 entered into Chinese market.
Faced with stiff competition from Microsoft, Kingsoft chief software architect Pak Kwan Kau (求伯君) injected 4 million Yuan of his own money developing WPS 97 for  Microsoft Windows. In 1997, WPS 97 was released. And only two years later the subsequent version, WPS 2000, was released. Both of them were developed for 16 bit Windows platform, could also run on later versions of Windows with 16 bit application support.
In May 2001, Kingsoft launched WPS Office, which comprises three components, word processor, spreadsheet and presentation, stating Kingsoft entered into the whole Chinese office productivity world.

===Growth===

In 2002, WPS Office 2002 surfaced as the next version of WPS Office and added to its bundle an email client. In a move hailed by many, WPS Office 2002 maintained interface compatibility with established office products and as a result dramatically reduced the amount of retraining required to migrate from Microsoft Office.
In 2003, WPS Office 2003 released. People familiar with Microsoft Office found easy moving to it. The Chinese government made Kingsoft office software the standard for various government branches.
The 2004 incarnation of the office suite, WPS Office Storm, was released in late 2004 to limited fanfare. In its increased effort to compete with Microsoft Office, WPS Office Storm claimed to offer perfect compatibility with the Microsoft Office document formats. Different from previous versions, WPS Storm was based on OpenOffice.org, and was the first to support platform other than Microsoft Windows. In a bid to differentiate itself from other office suites, Kingsoft collaborated with Intel and IBM to integrate their text-to-text and text-to-speech technology into WPS Office Storm. Its new technical capabilities became the focal point in an advertising campaign.
In late 2005, a completely redesigned WPS Office 2005 was released with smaller size. Besides the Professional edition, a free-of-charge edition was offered, in the hope of attracting more users. The personal edition was only offered in Simplified Chinese, licenced only to students and home users. A Wine-hosted edition was also provided for Linux users of WPS Office Storm.
In 2007, Kingsoft Office 2007 was released. Different from previous products, this is the first version trying entering into international market, with support English, Japanese besides native Chinese, for which it is still called WPS Office.
In 2009, Kingsoft Office 2009 was released which has increased compatibility with Microsoft Office including support for the 2007 version file formats. Kingsoft Office 2010 was released in 2010.
