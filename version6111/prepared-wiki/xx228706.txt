CATEGORIES: Glaciers of Livingston Island

Charity Glacier ([tpl]Coord|62|44|S|60|20|W|type:glacier_source:GNIS|display=inline,title[/tpl]) is a glacier on Rozhen Peninsula, Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica draining the southwest slopes of St. Methodius Peak in Tangra Mountains, and flowing west-southwestwards into False Bay north of Barnard Point, between Zagore Beach and Arkutino Beach.
The glacier was named by the UK Antarctic Place-names Committee in 1958 after the brig Charity (Capt. Charles H. Barnard), one of a fleet of American sealers from New York which visited the South Shetland Islands in 1820â€“21, operating mainly from Yankee Harbor, Greenwich Island. The Charity also visited the islands the following season.
