Gilberts Corner is an unincorporated area at the intersection of U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 15 in Loudoun County, Virginia to the east of Aldie.
There are no residences at this intersection, however, its name is attributed to the surrounding area. Gilberts Corner is named after the gas station/restaurant that sits at the northeast quadrant of the crossroads. It gained prominence in the 1920s when the Carolina Road (now Watson Road) was a toll road and U.S. Route 15 was extended south from Leesburg to U.S. Route 50. Due to increased traffic from toll evaders, U.S. Route 15 eventually was extended even further south. The gas station/restaurant closed in the 1980s and is now abandoned. Due to heavy traffic in the area, many commuters avoid the intersection altogether by going through Lenah and taking U.S. Route 15 south. The South Riding community approximately 5 miles to the east on U.S Route 50.

==Traffic Improvements==

On May 1, 2008, Sen. John Warner, Congressman Frank Wolf, and Supervisor Jim Burton attended a groundbreaking ceremony that is launching an improvement of the intersection.  As part of a traffic calming initiative suggested by the Piedmont Environmental Council and the Route 50 Traffic Planning Task Force, the suggestion was made to replace the signalized intersection with several roundabouts.
As of May 2008, a connector road to the east of Gilbert's Corner on Route 50 is being constructed to intersect Route 15 south of the existing intersection. Roundabouts will be used rather than traffic lights.
In the fall, the main intersection itself will be turned into a roundabout, and traffic lights removed.
After this, traffic calming will occur in Aldie, with the road being narrowed in order to slow down traffic.
All work is supposed to be complete by Fall 2009.
