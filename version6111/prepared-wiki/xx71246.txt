==Career==

Heilbrun attended graduate school in English literature at Columbia University, receiving her M.A. in 1951 and Ph.D in 1959.[tpl]cite web|title=Carolyn Heilbrun|url=http://www.c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/carolyn_heilbrun.html|work=C250 Celebrates: Columbians Ahead of Their Time|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=June 18, 2012[/tpl]  Among her most important mentors were Columbia professors Jacques Barzun and Lionel Trilling, while Clifton Fadiman was an important inspiration: She wrote about these three in her final non-fiction work, When Men Were the Only Models We Had:  My Teachers Barzun, Fadiman, Trilling (2002).
Heilbrun taught English at Columbia for more than three decades, from 1960 to 1992. She was the first woman to receive tenure in the English Department. Her academic specialty was British modern literature, with a particular interest in the Bloomsbury Group. Her academic books include the feminist study Writing a Woman's Life (1988). In 1983, she co-founded and became co-editor of the Columbia University Press's Gender and Culture Series with literary scholar Nancy K. Miller.[tpl]cite web|title=Gender and Culture Series|url=http://cup.columbia.edu/series/64|publisher=Columbia University Press|accessdate=June 18, 2012[/tpl] From 1985 until her retirement in 1992, she was Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities at Columbia.

==Kate Fansler mystery novels==

She was the author of fourteen Kate Fansler mysteries, written under the name Amanda Cross. Fansler, like Heilbrun, was an English professor. Heilbrun kept her second career as a mystery novelist secret in order to protect her academic career, until a fan discovered "Amanda Cross"'s true identity through copyright records. The novels, all set in academia, often were an outlet for Heilbrun's view on feminism, academic politics, and other political issues. Death in a Tenured Position (set at Harvard University) was particularly harsh in its criticism of the academic establishment's treatment of women.

==Life==

Heilbrun was born in East Orange, New Jersey, to Archibald Gold and Estelle Roemer Gold. The family moved to Manhattan when she was a child.  She graduated from Wellesley College in 1947 at the top of her class. She married James Heilbrun and they had three children.[tpl]cite web|last=Vergel|first=Gina|title=Economics Professor Remembered as a Gentleman and Scholar|url=http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_1202.asp|publisher=Fordham University|accessdate=June 17, 2012[/tpl] Carolyn Heilbrun committed suicide by taking an overdose of pills and placing a plastic bag over her headEuropean Journal of Life Writing at her apartment in New York City in 2003.
