Caixa Catalunya ([tpl]IPA-ca|ˈkaʃə kətəˈɫuɲə[/tpl]), the trading name of Caixa d'Estalvis de Catalunya, was a Catalan savings bank headquartered in Barcelona, Catalonia. It was owned by the Barcelona Provincial Government. It was the fifth largest savings bank in Spain, and the second largest banking institution in Catalonia, after La Caixa. As of December 2007, the bank had 1192 offices, all of them in Spain except one in Perpignan, France, and 1583 ATMs.
It was founded on October 26, 1926, under the name Caja de Ahorros Provincial de la Diputación de Barcelona. With the advent of the Second Republic and the reinstatement of the Generalitat, the name was changed to "Caixa d'Estalvis de la Generalitat de Catalunya", and the then President of the Generalitat, Francesc Macià, became president of the entity. Narcís Serra was its last president. On 1 July 2010, it merged with Caixa Tarragona and Caixa Manresa to form a new entity, which soon after started to trade under the name CatalunyaCaixa.
Caixa Catalunya owned the Casa Milà, also known as La Pedrera, one of Antoni Gaudí's most famous buildings, where it managed a cultural centre and exhibition area.
