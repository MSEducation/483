Winter (born 2005) is a bottlenose dolphin at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Clearwater, Florida, USA, widely known for having a prosthetic tail. She is the subject of the film Dolphin Tale, a dramatization of her story, and the upcoming sequel Dolphin Tale 2. Winter was found in the coastal waters of Florida in December 2005, caught in a crab trap, which resulted in the loss of her tail. She was found and taken to Clearwater Marine Aquarium.  The loss of her tail caused her to swim unnaturally with her tail moving side to side instead of up and down. As a result, she was fitted with a silicone and plastic tail that enabled her to swim normally. She has since become a highly popular attraction at the aquarium, which led to the film's making. She lives in her pool with another dolphin, Hope, who will be the subject of the 2014 sequel to Dolphin Tale, Dolphin Tale 2.

==Injury and discovery==

Winter was entangled in the ropes of a crab trap on December 10, 2005,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6147502|title=Researchers Hope to Give Dolphin Prosthetic Tail: Underwater interview of Diana Zucker by Melissa Block|work=National Public Radio[/tpl] in Mosquito Lagoon of the coastal waters of Florida. Winter received her name because she was found in December, traditionally considered a Winter month, even though the exact date of her rescue (December 10) is actually within Autumn.   The rope cut off the supply of blood to her tail. She was spotted and caught by a small fishing boat and a SeaWorld team (with assistance from the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute), who brought her to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium.[tpl]cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-11-27/news/os-winter-dolphin-volusia-rescue-20101127_1_prosthetic-tail-baby-dolphin-rescue-truck |title=Winter the dolphin's rescue off Volusia has Hollywood ending|author=Ludmilla Lelis, Orlando Sentinel|date=27 November[/tpl]

==Prosthetic tail==

Irish prosthetist Kevin Carroll and a team of experts took a year and a half designing and testing a tail for Winter, eventually settling on a simple silicone and plastic tail.[tpl]cite web  |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/08/08/earlyshow/contributors/debbyeturner/main3148359.shtml|title="Bionic" Dolphin Getting New Tail|author=Daniel Aven|date=9 August 2007|work=The Early Show|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=29 December 2010[/tpl] A gel-like sleeve was used under the tail, in order to prevent it from irritating Winter's skin.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/12/14/eveningnews/main661078.shtml|title=Fuji The Dolphin's Rubber Tail|date=26 August 2007|author= Jaime Holguin |work=CBS Evening News|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=29 December 2010 [/tpl] In Winter's case however, both the flukes and the caudal peduncle had been severed, making the task much more difficult.
Lessons learned from Winter also have been applied to human amputees. Carroll used the same gel sleeve concept to ease painful prosthetic limbs for US Air Force Senior Airman Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right hand in a 2004 mortar attack in Iraq.

==Influence==

Winter has become the most popular attraction at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium. She is often thought of as an inspiration to children and adults with medical conditions and disabilities. Brock Mealer (brother of Michigan Wolverines player Eliot Mealer), who was paralyzed in a car accident and overcame large odds against him, met Winter in December 2010 to significant press coverage.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/once-paralyzed-ohio-man-meets-clearwaters-winter-the-dolphin/1142467|title=Once-paralyzed Ohio man meets Clearwater's Winter the dolphin|author=Theodora Aggeles|date=30 December 2010|work=Tampabay.com|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=2 January[/tpl] Books and Nintendo DS games have been published about Winter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3752494 |title=Winter's Tail DS |publisher=Scholastic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/41320-scholastic--s--winter--s-tail--makes-waves.html |title=Scholastic’s ‘Winter’s Tail’ Makes Waves |publisher=Publishersweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23[/tpl]
