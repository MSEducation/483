D. Kim Rossmo is a Canadian criminologist specializing in geographic profiling. He joined the Vancouver Police Department  as a civilian employee in 1978 and became a sworn officer in 1980. In 1987 he received a Master's degree in criminology from Simon Fraser University and in 1995 became the first police officer in Canada to obtain a doctorate in criminology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hamiltonhowell.ca/cases/rossmo.htm|title=Rossmo v. Vancouver (City) Police Board|date=December 19, 2001|publisher=Hamilton Howell|accessdate=22 April 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110706182046/http://www.hamiltonhowell.ca/cases/rossmo.htm|archivedate=2011-07-06[/tpl] His dissertation research resulted in a new criminal investigative methodology called geographic profiling, based on Rossmo's formula.  This technology was integrated into a specialized crime analysis software product called Rigel.  The Rigel product is developed by the software company Environmental Criminology Research Inc. (ECRI), which Rossmo co-founded.Rich, T. and Shively, M (2004, December). P. 14. A Methodology for Evaluating Geographic Profiling Software.

In 1995, he was promoted to detective inspector and founded a geographic profiling section within the Vancouver Police Department. In 1998, his analysis of cases of missing sex trade workers determined that a serial killer was at work, a conclusion ultimately vindicated by the arrest and conviction of Robert Pickton in 2002. A retired Vancouver police staff sergeant has claimed that animosity toward Rossmo delayed the arrest of Pickton, leaving him free to carry out additional murders.http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/british-columbia/internal-police-strife-delayed-pickton-arrest-former-officer-says/article1667514/  His analytic results were not accepted at the time and after a falling out with senior members of the department he left in 2001. His unsuccessful lawsuit against the Vancouver Police Board for wrongful dismissal exposed considerable apparent dysfunction within that department.
After serving as director of research at the Police Foundation in Washington, DC, from 2001 to 2003, he moved to Texas State University-San Marcos where he currently holds the Endowed Chair in Criminology and is director of the Center for Geospatial Intelligence and Investigation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.txstate.edu/rising-stars/kim-rossmo.html|title=Rising Star Dr. Kim Rossmo|publisher=Texas State University-San Marcos|accessdate=22 April 2013[/tpl] Since then, he has applied techniques of geographic profiling to counterterrorism, animal foraging, and epidemiology. He has also researched and published on the subject of criminal investigative failures. He has written two books.
