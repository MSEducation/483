DC published several other ... Family titles concurrent with Batman Family. These included The Superman Family (1974-82), Super-Team Family (1975-1978) and Tarzan Family (1975-76). As a rule, DC's ... Family titles contained mostly reprints, and featured a higher page count (and higher price) than DC's normal books. Its final issue, #20, ran with no advertisements.

===Merger with Detective Comics===

In 1978, after the DC Implosion, it was decided that DC Comics' long-running flagship title Detective Comics was to be terminated with #480. However, the decision was overturned following strenuous arguments on behalf of saving the title within the DC office. Despite being the better selling title, Batman Family was instead merged with Detective, converting that book into a $1 68-page giant as of Detective #481 (Dec. 1978/Jan. 1979). This arrangement lasted 15 issues. With issue #496 (November 1980) Detective reverted to its traditional size and price — thus effectively canceling Batman Family for good.

===2002 Series===

In 2002 DC published an eight-issue miniseries, Batman: Family, written by John Francis Moore.  The first six issues were illustrated by Stefano Gaudiano and Rick Hoberg.  Steve Lieber replaced Hoeberg on issues seven and eight.
