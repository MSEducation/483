The table below shows the 1975 European Tour schedule which was made up of 19 tournaments, which included the major national opens around Europe. The other tournaments were mostly held in England and Scotland. There were several changes from the previous season, with the addition of the Carroll's Irish Open, replacing the Carroll's International, and the Kerrygold International Classic, and the loss of the Penfold Tournament, the W.D. & H.O. Wills Tournament and the El Paraiso Open.

==Order of Merit==

The PGA European Tour's money list was known as the "Order of Merit". It was based on a points system, which meant that some players could finish lower than others despite accumulating more prize money.
