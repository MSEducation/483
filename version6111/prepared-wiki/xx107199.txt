==Comic strip==

The Miss Fury comic strip began April 6, 1941. A character based loosely on Mills' own appearance, the artwork was created in a glamorous style with considerable attention placed on the heroine's outfits. As the strip became more popular, it eventually became public knowledge its creator was a woman. During World War II, Mills' cat Perri-Purr was introduced in the strip, and during World War II Perri-Purr became the unofficial mascot for the Allied troops.
Miss Fury ran until 1952, when Tarpé Mills mostly retired from the comics industry. She briefly returned in 1971 with Our Love Story for Marvel Comics.
She died in 1988.
