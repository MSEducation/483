The show launched the week of September 11, with Laura Flanders hosting from New York.  When Laura started with Air America in 2004, Farai Chideya split hosting duties, before taking over full-time.  After Farai left for News & Notes on NPR, Rebecca Roberts, daughter of NPR correspondent Cokie Roberts, hosted along with former CBC host Mary Ambrose.  Rose Aguilar and Sandip Roy took over hosting duties after Rebecca was hired by WETA in Washington, D.C.. Sandip is no longer with the person, and Rose continues as the main host, with others such as Holly Kiernan coming in on Wednesdays and other days.
