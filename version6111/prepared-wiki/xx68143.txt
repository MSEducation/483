A mesophile is an organism that grows best in moderate temperature, neither too hot nor too cold, typically between 20 and 45 °C (68 and 113 °F).Willey, Joanne M., Linda Sherwood, Christopher J. Woolverton, and Lansing M. Prescott. Prescott, Harley, and Klein's Microbiology. New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2008. Print. The term is mainly applied to microorganisms.
The habitats of these organisms include especially cheese, yogurt, and mesophile organisms are often included in the process of beer and wine making.
Organisms that prefer cold environments are termed  psychrophilic, those preferring warmer temperatures are termed thermophilic and those thriving in extremely hot environments are hyperthermophilic.
All bacteria have their own optimum environmental surroundings and temperatures in which they thrive the most. 
A genome-wide computational approach has been designed by Zheng, et al. to classify bacteria into mesophilic and thermophilic.
