[[Tetrazine]]

CATEGORIES: Nitrogen heterocycles

Tetrazine is an unstable compound that consists of a six-membered aromatic ring containing four nitrogen atoms with the molecular formula C2H2N4.  The name tetrazine is used in the nomenclature of derivatives of this compound. Three core-ring isomers exist: 1,2,3,4-tetrazines, 1,2,3,5-tetrazines and 1,2,4,5-tetrazines.

==1,2,3,4-tetrazines==

1,2,3,4-Tetrazines are often isolated fused to an aromatic ring system and are stabilized as the dioxide derivatives.

==1,2,4,5-tetrazine==

1,2,4,5-Tetrazines are very well known and myriad 3,6-disubstituted 1,2,4,5-tetrazines are known.(see United States Patent 6645325) These materials are of use in the area of energetic chemistry. 
The compound 3,6-di-2-pyridyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine Datasheet: Link has two pyridine substituents and is of importance as a reagent in Diels-Alder reactions. It reacts with norbornadiene in a sequence of one DA reaction and two retro-DA reactions to cyclopentadiene and a pyridazine with exchange of an acetylene unit:
