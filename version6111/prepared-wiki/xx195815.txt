==Sorunda church==

Sorunda church is an unusually large, medieval church. Its history goes back to the 12th century with major additions made in the 15th and 16th centuries. The church contains burial chapels for local aristocratic families and several interior details dating from the Middle Ages, notably an unusually fine wooden sculpture by Hermen Rode.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.visitnynashamn.se/en/home/todo/aktorer/sorundachurch.5.787ba9a21361e2e3bfa800030224.html|title= Sorunda church|author= |date= |website= |publisher= Visit Nynäshamn|accessdate=27 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]sv icon[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.sorundakyrka.se/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Info-om-kyrkan.pdf|title= Sorunda kyrka|author= |date= |website= |publisher= sorundakyrka.se|accessdate=27 April 2013[/tpl]
