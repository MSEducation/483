The old walled city lies on the west bank of the River Foyle, which is spanned by two road bridges and one footbridge. The city now covers both banks (Cityside on the west and Waterside on the east).  The city district also extends to rural areas to the southeast. The population of the city proper (the area defined by its 17th-century charter) was 83,652 in the 2001 Census, while the Derry Urban Area had a population of 90,736.http://www.ninis.nisra.gov.uk/mapxtreme_towns/report.asp?settlementName=Derry%20Urban%20Area%20(DUA)&BandName=Derry%20Urban%20Area%20(DUA)[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] The district is administered by Derry City Council and contains both Londonderry Port and City of Derry Airport.

Derry is close to the border with County Donegal, with which it has had a close link for many centuries. The person traditionally seen as the 'founder' of the original Derry is Saint Colmcille, a holy man from Tír Chonaill, the old name for almost all of modern County Donegal (of which the west bank of the Foyle was a part before c. 1600).
In 2013, Derry became the inaugural UK City of Culture, having been awarded the title in July 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-10653989|title=Londonderry named the UK City of Culture|last=BBC News|first=|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 July 2010 | date=2010-07-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/media_releases/6256.aspx|title=The race is on to find UK's first ‘City of Culture’ for 2013|last=Palmer|first=Robert|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=15 July 2010[/tpl]

==Name==

According to the city's Royal Charter of 10 April 1662 the official name is Londonderry. This was reaffirmed in a High Court decision in January 2007 when Derry City Council sought guidance on the procedure for effecting a name change.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/nie/cases/NIHC/QB/2007/5.html&query=title+(+Derry+)&method=boolean|title=Derry City Council, Re Application for Judicial Review 2007 NIQB 5 |date=2007-01-25|publisher=Derry City Council|accessdate=2008-08-28[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6297907.stm|title=Stroke City to remain Londonderry |date=2007-01-25|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-08-28[/tpl]  The council had changed its name from "Londonderry City Council" to "Derry City Council" in 1984;[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6213890.stm | work=BBC News | title=City name row lands in High Court | date=2006-12-06 | accessdate=2010-05-01[/tpl] the court case was seeking clarification as to whether this had also changed the name of the city.

Available: http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0409/1224244287427.html  Whereas official road signs in the Republic use the name Derry, those in Northern Ireland bear Londonderry (sometimes abbreviated to L'Derry), although some of these have been defaced with the reference to London obscured. Usage varies among local organisations, with both names being used. Examples are City of Derry Airport, City of Derry Rugby Club, Derry City FC and the Protestant Apprentice Boys of Derry, as opposed to Londonderry Port, Londonderry YMCA Rugby Club and Londonderry Chamber Of Commerce.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.londonderrychamber.co.uk/ |title=Londonderry Chamber of Commerce |publisher=Londonderrychamber.co.uk |accessdate=2010-06-20[/tpl] Most companies within the city choose local area names such as Pennyburn, Rosemount or "Foyle" from the River Foyle to avoid alienating the other community. Londonderry railway station is often referred to as Waterside railway station within the city but is called Derry/Londonderry at other stations. The council changed the name of the local government district covering the city to Derry on 7 May 1984, consequently renaming itself Derry City Council.Change of District Name (Derry) Order 1984 This did not change the name of the city, although the city is coterminous with the district, and in law the city council is also the "Corporation of Londonderry" or, more formally, the "Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of the City of Londonderry".Sections 7, 8 and 132 of the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 (Eliz II 20 & 21 c.9) The form "Londonderry" is used for the post town by the Royal Mail, however use of Derry will still ensure delivery.
The city is also nicknamed the Maiden City by virtue of the fact that its walls were never breached despite being besieged on three separate occasions in the 17th century, the most notable being the Siege of Derry of 1688/89.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1588|title=The Walled City Experience|publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board|accessdate=2008-09-04[/tpl] It is also nicknamed Stroke City by local broadcaster, Gerry Anderson, due to the 'politically correct' use of the oblique notation Derry/Londonderry  (which appellation has itself been used by BBC Television[ref]The One Show, BBC1, 15 July
 2010</ref>). A recent addition to the landscape has been the erection of several large stone columns on main roads into the city welcoming drivers, euphemistically, to "the walled city".
The name Derry is very much in popular use throughout Ireland for the naming of places, and there are at least six towns bearing that name and at least a further 79 places. The word Derry often forms part of the place name, for example Derrymore, Derrybeg and Derrylea.
The names Derry and Londonderry is not limited to Ireland. There is a town called Derry situated right beside another town called Londonderry in New Hampshire in the US. There are also Londonderrys in Yorkshire, England, in Vermont, USA, in Nova Scotia, Canada, and in northern and eastern Australia. Londonderry Island is situated off Tierra del Fuego in Chile.
Derry is also a fictional town in Maine, USA, used in some Stephen King novels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/images/map_of_maine.jpg |title=Stephen King's Map of Maine |accessdate=2012-05-13[/tpl]

The Walls were built during the period 1613-1619 by The Honourable The Irish Society as defences for early 17th century settlers from England and Scotland. The Walls, which are approximately 1 mile (1.5 km) in circumference and which vary in height and width between 12 and 35 feet (4 to 12 metres), are completely intact and form a walkway around the inner city. They provide a unique promenade to view the layout of the original town which still preserves its Renaissance style street plan. The four original gates to the Walled City are Bishop’s Gate, Ferryquay Gate, Butcher Gate and Shipquay Gate. Three further gates were added later, Magazine Gate, Castle Gate and New Gate, making seven gates in total. Historic buildings within the walls include the 1633 Gothic cathedral of St Columb, the Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall and the courthouse.
It is one of the few cities in Europe that never saw its fortifications breached, withstanding several sieges including one in 1689 which lasted 105 days, hence the city's nickname, The Maiden City.Historic Walls of Derry Discover Northern Ireland website

==History==

===Early history===

Derry is one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in Ireland. The earliest historical references date to the 6th century when a monastery was founded there by St Columba or Colmcille, a famous saint from what is now County Donegal, but for thousands of years before that people had been living in the vicinity.
Before leaving Ireland to spread Christianity elsewhere, Columba founded a monastery in the then Doire Calgach, on the east side of the river Foyle. According to oral and documented history, the site was granted to Columba by a local king. The monastery then remained in the hands of the federation of Columban churches who regarded Colmcille as their spiritual mentor. The year 546 is often referred to as the date that the original settlement was founded. However it is now accepted by historians that this was an erroneous date assigned by medieval chroniclers. It is accepted that between the 6th century and the 11th century, Derry was known primarily as a monastic settlement.
The town became strategically more significant during the Tudor conquest of Ireland and came under frequent attack, until in 1608 it was destroyed by Cahir O'Doherty, Irish chieftain of Inishowen.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl][/ref] The soldier and statesman Henry Docwra, 1st Baron Docwra of Culmore, made vigorous efforts to develop the town, earning the reputation of being " the founder of Derry"; but he was accused of failing to prevent the O'Doherty attack, and returned to England.

===Plantation===

Planters organised by London livery companies through The Honourable The Irish Society arrived in the 17th century as part of the Plantation of Ulster, and built the city of Londonderry across the Foyle from the earlier town, with walls to defend it from Irish insurgents who opposed the plantation. The aim was to settle Ulster with a population supportive of the Crown.
This city was the first planned city in Ireland: it was begun in 1613, with the walls being completed in 1619, at a cost of £10,757.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.derryswalls.com/hist-walls-constructed.html|title=Walls Constructed|accessdate=2012-07-23|publisher=Guildhall Press|date=2005-8|work=Derry's Walls[/tpl] The central diamond within a walled city with four gates was thought to be a good design for defence. The grid pattern chosen was subsequently much copied in the colonies of British North America.[tpl]cite web|url=http://worldfacts.us/UK-Londonderry.htm|title=World Facts Index > United Kingdom > Londonderry|year=2005|publisher=worldfacts.us|accessdate=2006-09-05[/tpl] The charter initially defined the city as extending three Irish miles (about 6.1 km) from the centre.
The modern city preserves the 17th century layout of four main streets radiating from a central Diamond to four gateways  — Bishop's Gate, Ferryquay Gate, Shipquay Gate and Butcher's Gate. The city's oldest surviving building was also constructed at this time: the 1633 Plantation Gothic cathedral of St Columb. In the porch of the cathedral is a stone that records completion with the inscription: "If stones could speake, then London's prayse should sound, Who built this church and cittie from the grounde."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stcolumbscathedral.org/History.htm |title=BRIEF HISTORY OF ST COLUMB'S CATHEDRAL LONDONDERRY |accessdate=2010-02-13 |publisher=www.stcolumbscathedral.org[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]

===17th-century upheavals===

During the 1640s, the city suffered in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, which began with the Irish Rebellion of 1641, when the Gaelic Irish insurgents made a failed attack on the city. In 1649 the city and its garrison, which supported the republican Parliament in London, were besieged by Scottish Presbyterian forces loyal to King Charles I. The Parliamentarians besieged in Derry were relieved by a strange alliance of Roundhead troops under George Monck and the Irish Catholic general Owen Roe O'Neill. These temporary allies were soon fighting each other again however, after the landing in Ireland of the New Model Army in 1649. The war in Ulster was finally brought to an end when the Parliamentarians crushed the Irish Catholic Ulster army at the battle of Scarrifholis in nearby Donegal in 1650.
During the Glorious Revolution, only Derry and nearby Enniskillen had a Protestant garrison by November 1688. An army of around 1,200 men, mostly "Redshanks" (Highlanders), under Alexander Macdonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim, was slowly organised (they set out on the week William of Orange landed in England). When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the Siege of Derry began. In April 1689, King James came to the city and summoned it to surrender. The King was rebuffed and the siege lasted until the end of July with the arrival of a relief ship.

===18th and 19th centuries===

The city was rebuilt in the 18th century with many of its fine Georgian style houses still surviving. The city's first bridge across the River Foyle was built in 1790. During the 18th and 19th centuries the port became an important embarkation point for Irish emigrants setting out for North America. Some of these founded the colonies of Derry and Londonderry in the state of New Hampshire.
Also during the 19th century, it became a destination for migrants fleeing areas more severely affected by the Irish Potato Famine.[tpl]cite journal|title=The population of Londonderry during the Great Irish Famine|journal=The Economic History Review|last=Johnson|first=James H.|year=1957|volume=10|issue=2|pages=273–285|doi=10.2307/2590863|jstor=2590863|publisher=Blackwell Publishing[/tpl]Page 67 "Derry beyond the walls" by SDLP politician John Hume One of the most notable shipping lines was the McCorkell Line operated by Wm. McCorkell & Co. Ltd. from 1778.http://www.mccorkellline.com/ McCorkell Line The McCorkell's most famous ship was the Minnehaha, which was known as the "Green Yacht from Derry".

===Early 20th century===

====World War I====

The city contributed over 5,000 men to the British Army from Catholic and Protestant families.

====Partition====

During the Irish War of Independence, the area was rocked by sectarian violence, partly prompted by the guerilla war raging between the Irish Republican Army and British forces, but also influenced by economic and social pressures. By mid-1920 there was severe sectarian rioting in the city. Many lives were lost and in addition many Catholics and Protestants were expelled from their homes during this communal unrest. After a week's violence, a truce was negotiated by local politicians on both unionist and republican sides.
In 1921, following the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the Partition of Ireland, it unexpectedly became a 'border city', separated from much of its traditional economic hinterland in County Donegal.

====World War II====

During World War II, the city played an important part in the Battle of the Atlantic.
Ships from the Royal Navy, the Royal Canadian Navy, and other Allied navies were stationed in the city and the United States military established a base. Over 20,000 Royal Navy, 10,000 Royal Canadian Navy, and 6,000 American Navy personnel were stationed in the city during the war.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/radiofoyle/peoples_war/context.shtml |title=BBC Online - Northern Ireland - Radio Foyle |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2012-05-13[/tpl]
The establishment of the American presence in the city was the result of a secret agreement between the Americans and the British before the Americans entered the war.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article/447/world-war-two-in-derry |title=World War Two In Derry |publisher=Culturenorthernireland.org |accessdate=2012-05-13[/tpl] It was the first American naval base in Europe and the terminal for American convoys en route to Europe.
The reason for such a high degree of military and naval activity was self-evident: Derry was the United Kingdom's westernmost port; indeed, the city was the westernmost Allied port in Europe: thus, Derry was a crucial jumping-off point, together with Glasgow and Liverpool, for the shipping convoys that ran between Europe and North America. The large numbers of military personnel in Derry substantially altered the character of the city, bringing in some outside colour to the local area, as well as some cosmopolitan and economic buoyancy during these years. Several airfields were built in the outlying regions of the city at this time, Maydown, Eglinton and Ballykelly. RAF Eglinton went on to become City of Derry Airport.
The city contributed significant number of men to the war effort throughout the services, most notably the 500 men in the 9th (Londonderry) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, known as the ‘Derry Boys’. This regiment served in North Africa, the Sudan, Italy and mainland UK. Many others served in the Merchant Navy taking part in the convoys that supplied the UK and Russia during the war.
The border location of the city, and influx of trade from the military convoys allowed for significant smuggling operations to develop in the city.
At the conclusion of the Second World War, eventually some 60 U-boats of the German Kriegsmarine ended in the city's harbour at Lisahally after their surrender. The initial surrender was attended by Admiral Sir Maxwell Horton, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Approaches, and Sir Basil Brooke, third Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.

===Late 20th Century===

====1950s and 1960s====

The city languished after the second world war, with unemployment and development stagnating.

====The Civil Rights Movement====

Derry was a focal point for the nascent civil rights movement in Northern Ireland.
Catholics were discriminated against under Unionist government in Northern Ireland, both politically and economically.Explaining Northern Ireland: broken images by John McGarry, Brendan O'Leary (ISBN 978-0631183495), pages 205-206Race and inequality: world perspectives on affirmative action by Elaine Kennedy-Dubourdieu (ISBN 978-0754648390), page 108The Irish Catholic diaspora in America by Lawrence John McCaffrey (ISBN 978-0813208961), page 168 In the late 1960s the city became the flashpoint of disputes about institutional gerrymandering. Political scientist John Whyte explains that:
 
 All the accusations of gerrymandering, practically all the complaints about housing and regional policy, and a disproportionate amount of the charges about public and private employment come from this area. The area – which consisted of Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh, Londonderry County Borough, and portions of Counties Londonderry and Armagh - had less than a quarter of the total population of Northern Ireland yet generated not far short of three-quarters of the complaints of discrimination...The unionist government must bear its share of responsibility. It put through the original gerrymander which underpinned so many of the subsequent malpractices, and then, despite repeated protests, did nothing to stop those malpractices continuing. The most serious charge against the Northern Ireland government is not that it was directly responsible for widespread discrimination, but that it allowed discrimination on such a scale over a substantial segment of Northern Ireland.[tpl]cite book|last=Whyte|first=John|title=Contemporary Irish Studies|editor=Gallagher, Tom; O'Connell, James|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|year=1983|chapter=How much discrimination was there under the unionist regime, 1921-68?|isbn=0-7190-0919-7|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm#chap1[/tpl]

A civil rights demonstration in 1968 led by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association was banned by the Government and blocked using force by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The events that followed the August 1969 Apprentice Boys parade resulted in the Battle of the Bogside, when Catholic rioters fought the police, leading to widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and is often dated as the starting point of the Troubles.
On Sunday 30 January 1972, 13 unarmed civilians were shot dead by British paratroopers during a civil rights march in the Bogside area. Another 13 were wounded and one further man later died of his wounds. This event came to be known as Bloody Sunday.

===Troubles===

The conflict which became known as the Troubles is widely regarded as having started in Derry with the Battle of the Bogside. The Civil Rights movement had also been very active in the city. In the early '70s the city was heavily militarised and there was widespread civil unrest. Several districts in the city constructed barricades to control access and prevent the forces of the state from entering.
Violence eased towards the end of the Troubles in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Irish journalist Ed Maloney claims in "The Secret History of the IRA" that republican leaders there negotiated a de facto ceasefire in the city as early as 1991. Whether this is true or not, the city did see less bloodshed by this time than Belfast or other localities.
The city was visited by a killer whale in November 1977 at the height of the Troubles; it was dubbed Dopey Dick by the thousands who came from miles around to see him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/radiofoyle/dopeydick/|title=A whale of a time|publisher=BBC Radio Foyle|accessdate=2008-10-12[/tpl]

==Governance==

The local district council is Derry City Council, which consists of five electoral areas: Cityside, Northland, Rural, Shantallow and Waterside.  The council of 30 members is re-elected every four years. As of the 2011 election, 14 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) members, ten Sinn Féin, five Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), and one Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) make up the council.[tpl]Update after|2010|11|5[/tpl] The mayor and deputy mayor are elected annually by councillors.
The local authority boundaries correspond to the Foyle constituency of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Foyle constituency of the Northern Ireland Assembly. In European Parliament elections, it is part of the Northern Ireland constituency.

===Coat of arms and motto===

The devices on the city's arms are a skeleton and a three-towered castle on a black field, with the chief or top third of the shield depicting the arms of the City of London: a red cross and sword on white. In the centre of the cross is a gold harp.
The blazon of the arms is as follows:
Sable, a human skeleton Or seated upon a mossy stone proper and in dexter chief a castle triple towered argent on a chief also argent a cross gules thereon a harp or and in the first quarter a sword erect gulesLetters Patent certifying the arms of the City of Londonderry issued to Derry City Council, sealed by Garter and Norroy and Ulster Kings of Arms dated 30 April 2003
According to documents in the College of Arms in London and the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland in Dublin, the arms of the city were confirmed in 1613 by Daniel Molyneux, Ulster King of Arms. The College of Arms document states that the original arms of the City of Derry were ye picture of death (or a skeleton) on a moissy stone & in ye dexter point a castle and that upon grant of a charter of incorporation and the renaming of the city as Londonderry in that year the first mayor had requested the addition of a "chief of London".Genealogical Office, Dublin: GO Ms 60, Sketches of arms by Richard Carney, fol. 47College of Arms, London: The Arms of Peers of Ireland and some Commoners, fol. 133d (c.1652)
Theories have been advanced as to the meaning of the "old" arms of Derry, before the addition of the chief bearing the arms of the City of London:
In 1979, Londonderry City Council, as it was then known, commissioned a report into the city's arms and insignia, as part of the design process for an heraldic badge. The published report found that there was no basis for any of the popular explanations for the skeleton and that it was "purely symbolic and does not refer to any identifiable person".L E Rothwell, An inquiry initiated by Derry City Council into the ensigns armourial and related matters of the City of Londonderry
The 1613 records of the arms depicted a harp in the centre of the cross, but this was omitted from later depictions of the city arms, and in the Letters Patent confirming the arms to Londonderry Corporation in 1952.Letters Patent ratifying and confirming the arms of the City of Londonderry sealed by Garter and Norroy & Ulster Kings of Arms dated 28 April 1952 In 2002 Derry City Council applied to the College of Arms to have the harp restored to the city arms, and Garter and Norroy & Ulster Kings of Arms accepted the 17th century evidence, issuing letters patent to that effect in 2003.
The motto attached to the coat of arms reads in Latin, "Vita, Veritas, Victoria". This translates into English as, "Life, Truth, Victory".

==Geography==

Derry is characterised by its distinctively hilly topography. The River Foyle forms a deep valley as it flows through the city, making Derry a place of very steep streets and sudden, startling views. The original walled city of Londonderry lies on a hill on the west bank of the River Foyle. In the past, the river branched and enclosed this wooded hill as an island; over the centuries, however, the western branch of the river dried up and became a low-lying and boggy district that is now called the Bogside.
Today, modern Derry extends considerably north and west of the city walls and east of the river. The half of the city the west of the Foyle is known as the Cityside and the area east is called the Waterside. The Cityside and Waterside are connected by the Craigavon Bridge and Foyle Bridge, and by a foot bridge in the centre of the city called Peace Bridge. The district also extends into rural areas to the southeast of the city.
This much larger city, however, remains characterised by the often extremely steep hills that form much of its terrain on both sides of the river. A notable exception to this lies on the north-eastern edge of the city, on the shores of Lough Foyle, where large expanses of sea and mudflats were reclaimed in the middle of the 19th century. Today, these slob lands are protected from the sea by miles of sea walls and dikes. The area is an internationally important bird sanctuary, ranked among the top 30 wetland sites in the UK.
Other important nature reserves lie at Ness Country Park,[ref]

===Climate===

Derry has, like most of Ireland, a temperate maritime climate[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.derry-ldy.airports-guides.com/ldy_climate.html |title=Airport guides climate page |publisher=Derry-ldy.airports-guides.com |date=2012-01-05 |accessdate=2012-05-13[/tpl] according to the Köppen climate classification system.

==Demography==

Derry Urban Area (DUA), including the city and the neighbouring settlements of Culmore, Newbuildings and Strathfoyle, is classified as a city by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) since its population exceeds 75,000. On census day (27 March 2011) there were 105,066 people living in Derry Urban Area. Of these, 27% were aged under 16 years and 14% were aged 60 and over; 49% of the population were male and 51% were female; 75% were from a Roman Catholic background and 23% (up three percent from 2001) were from a Protestant background.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census/2011_results_population.html|title=Census 2011 - Population and Household Estimates for Northern Ireland|publisher=Northern Ireland Statistics & Research Agency|accessdate=2012-09-24[/tpl]
The mid-2006 population estimate for the wider Derry City Council area was 107,300.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nisra.gov.uk/archive/demography/publications/pr_mye_2006.pdf|title=Statistics press notice: Mid-year population estimates Northern Ireland (2006)|publisher=Northern Ireland Statistics & Research Agency|date=2007-07-31|accessdate=2008-08-28|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080626114426/http://www.nisra.gov.uk/archive/demography/publications/pr_mye_2006.pdf  |archivedate = 2008-06-26[/tpl] Population growth in 2005/06 was driven by natural change, with net out-migration of approximately 100 people.
The city was one of the few in Ireland to experience an increase in population during the Irish Potato Famine as migrants came to it from other, more heavily affected areas.

===Protestant minority===

Concerns have been raised by both communities over the increasingly divided nature of the city. There were about 17,000 Protestants on the west bank of the River Foyle in 1971.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/proni/1979/proni_CENT-1-8-11A_1979-01-11.pdf|title=Londonderry population movement from West bank to East bank |date=11 Jan 1979 |publisher=[/tpl] The proportion then rapidly declined;[tpl]cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/proni/1978/proni_CENT-1-8-11A_1978-11-06.pdf |title=Note of a meeting between Secretary of State and William Ross Unionist MP |date=6 Nov 1978 |publisher=Public Records Office of Northern Ireland[/tpl] there are now only about 2,000 on the west bank,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.londonderrysentinel.co.uk/news/catholics-outnumber-protestants-on-both-banks-of-the-foyle-1-4737478 |title=Catholics outnumber Protestants on both banks of the Foyle|publisher=Londonderry Sentinel|date=31 Jan 2013|first=Kevin|last=Mullenaccessdate=2013-05-18[/tpl] and it is feared that the city could become permanently divided.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6060810.stm|title=Catholics urged to support neighbours|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-10-18|accessdate=2008-08-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/derryreport.pdf|title=Population Change and Social Inclusion Study: Derry/Londonderry|author=Peter Shirlow, Brian Graham, Amanda McMullan, Brendan Murtagh, Gillian Robinson and Neil Southern|publisher=Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister|year=2005|accessdate=2008-03-27|format=PDF[/tpl]
However, concerted efforts have been made by local community, church and political leaders from both traditions to redress the problem. A conference to bring together key actors and promote tolerance was held in October 2006.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6060810.stm|title=Catholics urged to support neighbours|date=2006-10-18|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-08-28[/tpl] The Rt Rev. Dr Ken Good, the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, said he was happy living on the cityside. "I feel part of it. It is my city and I want to encourage other Protestants to feel exactly the same", he said.
Support for Protestants in the district has been strong from the former SDLP city Mayor Helen Quigley. Cllr Quigley has made inclusion and tolerance key themes of her mayoralty. The Mayor Helen Quigley said it is time for "everyone to take a stand to stop the scourge of sectarian and other assaults in the city."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.derryjournal.com/editorial/Taking-a-stand.1620934.jp|title=Taking a Stand Derry Journal Editorial|date=2006-07-11|publisher=Derry Journal|accessdate=2008-08-28[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]

==Economy==

===History===

The economy of the district was based significantly on the textile industry until relatively recently. For many years women were often the sole wage earners working in the shirt factories while the men predominantly in comparison had high levels of unemployment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.recirca.com/backissues/c95/dwc.shtml|title=Women, art and architecture appear to have achieved a rare symbiosis in a new project in Derry|year=2001|publisher=Declan Sheehan CIRCA 95|accessdate=2006-09-05[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] This led to significant male emigration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bloodysundaytrust.org/eduhistory.htm|title=History of the Bogside|publisher=Bloody Sunday Trust|accessdate=2006-09-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060823085030/http://www.bloodysundaytrust.org/eduhistory.htm  |archivedate = 2006-08-23[/tpl] The history of shirt making in the city dates back as far as 1831 and is said to have been started by William Scott and his family who first exported shirts to Glasgow.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/historyofshirtmakinginderry/shirtmakinginderry.htm|title= Derrys association with shirt making|publisher=GeoCities.com|accessdate=2006-09-05|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071225221059/http://www.geocities.com/historyofshirtmakinginderry/shirtmakinginderry.htm|archivedate=2007-12-25[/tpl] Within 50 years, shirt making in the city was the most prolific in the UK with garments being exported all over the world. It was known so well that the industry received a mention in Das Kapital by Karl Marx, when discussing the factory system:

The industry reached its peak in the 1920s employing around 18,000 people. In modern times however the textile industry declined due to in most part cheaper Asian wages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.derryjournal.com/features/Thriving-industry-is-no-more.4184442.jp|title=Thriving industry is no more: Glory days of shirt factories recalled|date=2008-06-13|publisher=Derry Journal Online|accessdate=2008-06-15[/tpl]
A long-term foreign employer in the area is Du Pont, which has been based at Maydown since 1958, its first European production facility.[tpl]cite web|url=http://heritage.dupont.com/touchpoints/tp_1958/depth.shtml|title=First European Plant –1958|publisher=heritage.dupont.com.|accessdate=2006-09-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060317060124/http://heritage.dupont.com/touchpoints/tp_1958/depth.shtml  |archivedate = 2006-03-17[/tpl] Originally Neoprene was manufactured at Maydown and subsequently followed by Hypalon. More recently Lycra and Kevlar production units were active.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/|title=Du Pont (UK) Ltd|publisher=Northern Ireland Executive|accessdate=2006-09-05[/tpl] Thanks to a healthy worldwide demand for Kevlar which is made at the plant, the facility recently undertook a £40 million upgrade to expand its global Kevlar production. Du Pont has stated that contributing factors to its continued commitment to Maydown are "low labor costs, excellent communications, and tariff-free, easy access to the Britain and European continent."

===Inward investment===

In the last 15 years there has been a drive to increase inward investment in the city, more recently concentrating on digital industries. Currently the three largest private-sector employers are American firms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/s/p/rem/13319.htm|title=U.S.-Irish Business Summit|last=N.

Seagate currently employs over 1,000 people, producing more than half of the company's total requirement for hard drive read-write heads.
A recent but controversial new employer in the area is Raytheon, Raytheon Systems Limited, was established in 1999, in the Ulster Science & Technology Park, Buncrana Road.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/428973.stm|title=UK: Northern Ireland Software centre plans under fire|date=1999-06-25|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-12-15[/tpl]  Although some of the local people welcomed the jobs boost, others in the area objected to the jobs being provided by a firm involved heavily in the arms trade.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/2886611.stm|title=Protest over NI missile firm|date=2003-03-25|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2006-08-27[/tpl] Following four years of protest by the Foyle Ethical Investment Campaign, in 2004 Derry City Council passed a motion declaring the district a "A 'No – Go' Area for the Arms Trade".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.ie/article/62917|title=Derry City Now A 'No – Go' Area for the Arms Trade|date=2004-01-08|publisher=www.indymedia.ie|accessdate=2006-07-19[/tpl] In 2009, the company announced that it was not renewing its lease when it expired in 2010 and was looking for a new location for its operations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.londonderrysentinel.co.uk/news/Raytheon-looks-for-new-home.5381105.jp|title=Raytheon looks for new home|date = 2009-06-19|publisher=Londonderry Sentinel|accessdate=2009-12-15[/tpl]
Significant multinational employers in the region include Firstsource of India, DuPont, INVISTA, Stream International, Seagate Technology, Perfecseal, NTL, Raytheon and Northbrook Technology of the United States, Arntz Belting and Invision Software of Germany, and Homeloan Management of the UK. Major local business employers include Desmonds, Northern Ireland's largest privately owned company, manufacturing and sourcing garments, E&I Engineering, St. Brendan's Irish Cream Liqueur and McCambridge Duffy, one of the largest insolvency practices in the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.derrycity.gov.uk/economicdevelopment/downloads/1709M%20DERRY%20BOOK.pdf|title=Derry  — Regional City|publisher=Derry City Council|accessdate=2008-04-08|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Even though the city provides cheap labour by standards in Western Europe, critics have noted that the grants offered by the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board have helped land jobs for the area that only last as long as the funding lasts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marxist.net/ireland/beyondframe.htm?ch8.htm|title=Beyond the Troubles? - Chapter 8, Will there be peace?|last=Hadden|first=Peter|year=1994|publisher=Marxist|accessdate=2006-09-05[/tpl] This was reflected in questions to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Richard Needham, in 1990.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm198990/cmhansrd/1990-03-01/Orals-1.html|title=House of Commons  – Column 372 & 373|date=1990-03-01|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=2006-09-05[/tpl] It was noted that it cost £30,000 to create one job in an American firm in Northern Ireland.
Critics of investment decisions affecting the district often point to the decision to build a new university building in nearby (predominately Protestant) Coleraine rather than developing the University of Ulster Magee Campus. Another major government decision affecting the city was the decision to create the new town of Craigavon outside Belfast, which again was detrimental to the development of the city. Even in October 2005, there was perceived bias against the comparatively impoverished North West of the province, with a major civil service job contract going to Belfast. Mark Durkan, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader and Member of Parliament (MP) for Foyle was quoted in the Belfast Telegraph as saying:

In July 2005, the Irish Minister for Finance, Brian Cowen, called for a joint task force to drive economic growth in the cross border region. This would have implications for Counties Londonderry, Tyrone, and Donegal across the border.

===Shopping===

The city is the north west's foremost shopping district, housing two large shopping centres along with numerous shop packed streets serving much of the greater county, as well as Tyrone and Donegal. While retail developments in Letterkenny have lessened cross-border traffic from north County Donegal,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] the weakness of the pound sterling over the course of 2009 made border towns such as Derry attractive to shoppers from south of the border.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/poundrsquos-record-low-to-bring-a-swarm-of-euro-shoppers-14105210.html|title=Pound’s record low to bring a swarm of euro shoppers|date=2008-12-12|work=Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=2009-11-09[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/business-news/northern-irelandrsquos-border-retailers-gear-up-for-a-euro-boost-this-christmas-14547191.html|title=Northern Ireland’s border retailers gear up for a euro boost this Christmas|date=2009-11-02|work=Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=2009-11-09[/tpl]
The city centre has two main shopping centres; the Foyleside Shopping Centre which has 45 stores and 1430 parking spaces, and the Richmond Centre, which has 39 retail units. The Quayside Shopping Centre also serves the city-side and there is also Lisnagelvin Shopping Centre in the Waterside. These centres, as well as local-run businesses, feature numerous national and international stores. A recent addition was the Crescent Link Retail Park located in the Waterside with many international chain stores, including Homebase, Currys & PC World (stores combined), Carpet Right, Maplin, Argos Extra, Toys R Us, Halfords, DW Sports (formerly JJB Sports), Pets at Home, Next Home, Starbucks, McDonalds, Tesco Express and M&S Simply Food. In the short space of time that this site has been operational, it has quickly grown to become the second largest retail park in Northern Ireland (second only to Sprucefield in Lisburn).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.derryjournal.com/business/Crescent-Link-Retail-Park-bought.3462253.jp|title=Crescent Link Retail Park bought for £92 m|date=2007-11-09|publisher=Derry Journal Online|accessdate=2008-06-15[/tpl] Plans have also been approved for Derry's first Asda store, which will be located at the retail park sharing a unit with Homebase.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/derrys-first-asda-store-to-create-350-jobs-29007917.html|title=Derry's first Asda store to create 350 jobs|date=2012-12-22|work=Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=2013-12-31[/tpl] Sainsbury's also applied for planning permission for a store at Crescent Link, but Environment Minister Alex Attwood turned it down.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-20812156|title=Attwood gives ASDA green light for new Londonderry store|date=2012-12-21|work=BBC News|accessdate=2013-12-31[/tpl]
The city is also home to the world's oldest independent department store; Austins. Established in 1830, Austins predates Jenners of Edinburgh by 5 years, Harrods of London by 15 years and Macy's of New York by 25 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.austinsstore.com/Pages/about_us/austins_in_brief |title=Austins In Brief |publisher=Austinsstore.com |accessdate=2010-06-20[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] The store's five-story Edwardian building is located within the walled city in the area known as The Diamond.

==Landmarks==

Derry is renowned for its architecture. This can be primarily ascribed to the formal planning of the historic walled city of Derry at the core of the modern city. This is centred on the Diamond with a collection of late Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian buildings maintaining the gridlines of the main thoroughfares (Shipquay Street, Ferryquay Street, Butcher Street and Bishop Street) to the City Gates. St Columb's Cathedral does not follow the grid pattern reinforcing its civic status. This Church of Ireland Cathedral was the first post-Reformation Cathedral built for an Anglican church. The construction of the Roman Catholic St Eugene's Cathedral in the Bogside in the 19th-century was another major architectural addition to the city. The more recent infill buildings within the walls are of varying quality and in many cases these were low quality hurriedly constructed replacements for 1970s bomb damaged buildings [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]. The Townscape Heritage Initiative has funded restoration works to key listed buildings and other older structures.
In the three centuries since their construction, the city walls have been adapted to meet the needs of a changing city. The best example of this adaptation is the insertion of three additional gates  — Castle Gate, New Gate and Magazine Gate  — into the walls in the course of the 19th century. Today, the fortifications form a continuous promenade around the city centre, complete with cannon, avenues of mature trees and views across Derry. Historic buildings within the city walls include St Augustine's Church, which sits on the city walls close to the site of the original monastic settlement; the copper-domed Austin's department store, which claims to the oldest such store in the world; and the imposing Greek Revival Courthouse on Bishop Street. The red-brick late-Victorian Guildhall, also crowned by a copper dome, stands just beyond Shipquay Gate and close to the river front.
There are many museums and sites of interest in and around the city, including the Foyle Valley Railway Centre, the Amelia Earhart Centre And Wildlife Sanctuary, the Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall, Ballyoan Cemetery, The Bogside, numerous murals by the Bogside Artists, Derry Craft Village, Free Derry Corner, O'Doherty Tower (now home to part of the Tower Museum), the Guildhall, the Harbour Museum, the Museum of Free Derry, Chapter House Museum, the Workhouse Museum, the Nerve Centre, St. Columb's Park and Leisure Centre, St Eugene's Cathedral, Creggan Country Park, The Millennium Forum and the Foyle and Craigavon bridges.
The city has seen a large boost to its economy in the form of tourism over the last few years [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]. Cheap flights offered by budget airlines have enticed many people to visit the city. Tourism mainly focuses around the pubs, mainly those of Waterloo Street [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]. Other attractions include museums, a vibrant shopping centre and trips to the Giant's Causeway, which is approximately [tpl]convert|50|mi|km[/tpl] away, though poorly connected by public transport. Lonely Planet called Londonderry the fourth best city in the world to see in 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-20039650 |title=BBC News - Londonderry 'world's fourth best city to visit' in 2013 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-10-23 |accessdate=2012-10-28[/tpl]

It has taken control of two former British Army barracks in the centre of the city. The Ebrington site is nearing completion and is linked to the city centre by the new Peace Bridge.

==Transport==

The transport network is built out of a complex array of old and modern roads and railways throughout the city and county. The city's road network also makes use of two bridges to cross the River Foyle, the Craigavon Bridge and the Foyle Bridge, the longest bridge in Ireland. Derry also serves as a major transport hub for travel throughout nearby County Donegal.
In spite of it being the second city of Northern Ireland (and it being the second-largest city in all of Ulster), road and rail links to other cities are below par for its standing. Many business leaders claim that government investment in the city and infrastructure has been badly lacking.

===Buses===

Most public transport in Northern Ireland is operated by the subsidiaries of Translink. Originally the city's internal bus network was run by Ulsterbus, which still provides the city's connections with other towns in Northern Ireland. The city's buses are now run by Ulsterbus Foyle,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.translink.co.uk/20060904newulsterbusfoyle.asp|title=The launch of Ulsterbus Foyle|publisher=Translink|accessdate=2006-09-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070311165354/http://www.translink.co.uk/20060904newulsterbusfoyle.asp  |archivedate = 2007-03-11[/tpl] just as Translink Metro now provides the bus service in Belfast. The Ulsterbus Foyle network offers 13 routes across the city into the suburban areas, excluding an Easibus link which connects to the Waterside and Drumahoe,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.translink.co.uk/present/IndexOpSvc.asp#FOY|title=Foyle Area Ulsterbus routes|accessdate=2008-06-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080527090847/http://www.translink.co.uk/present/IndexOpSvc.asp#FOY  |archivedate = 2008-05-27[/tpl] and a free Rail Link Bus runs from the Waterside Railway Station to the city centre. All buses leave from the Foyle Street Bus Station in the city centre.
Long distance buses depart from Foyle Street Bus Station to destinations throughout Ireland. Buses are operated by both Ulsterbus and Bus Éireann on cross-border routes and also by Lough Swilly buses to Co. Donegal. There is a half-hourly service to Belfast every day, called the Maiden City Flyer, which is the Goldline Express flagship route. There are hourly services to Strabane, Omagh, Coleraine, Letterkenny and Buncrana, and eleven services a day to bring people to Dublin. There is a daily service to Sligo, Galway, Shannon Airport and Limerick.

===Air===

City of Derry Airport, the council-owned airport near Eglinton, has been growing in recent years with new investment in extending the runway and plans to redevelop the terminal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.4ni.co.uk/industrynews.asp?ID=38867|title=Story of investment - £10 million investment in City of Derry Airport.|publisher=4ni.co.uk|accessdate=2006-09-22[/tpl] It is hoped that the new investment will add to the airport's currently limited array of domestic and international flights and reduce the annual subsidy of £3.5 million from the local council.
Work has commenced to turn the A2 from Maydown to Eglinton and in turn the airport into a dual carriageway, with completion estimated by November 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/roads/a2maydowndualling.html |title=A2 dualling Maydown to City of Derry airport - Northern Ireland Roads Site |publisher=Wesleyjohnston.com |accessdate=2010-06-20[/tpl] City of Derry airport is the main regional airport for County Donegal, County Londonderry and west County Tyrone as well as Derry City itself.
The airport is served by Ryanair with scheduled flights to Birmingham International Airport, Glasgow Prestwick Airport, Liverpool, and London Stansted all year round with a summer schedule to Alicante and Faro, as well as a summer charter flight to Majorca operated by TUIfly for 2014.

===Railways===

Northern Ireland Railways (N.I.R.) has a single route from Londonderry railway station (also known as Waterside Station) on the Waterside to [tpl]rws|Belfast Central[/tpl] and Belfast Great Victoria Street via [tpl]rws|Coleraine[/tpl], [tpl]rws|Ballymoney[/tpl], [tpl]rws|Ballymena[/tpl], [tpl]rws|Antrim[/tpl] and Mossley West. The service, which had been allowed to deteriorate in the 1990s, has since been improved by increased investment.
In 2008 the Department for Regional Development announced a plan to have the track re-laid between Derry and Coleraine by 2013, add a passing loop to increase traffic capacity and increase the number of trains by introducing two additional diesel multiple units.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishnews.com/articles/540/5860/2008/6/12/590126_34824869487716386 m.html |title=£86 m upgrade to rail link will 'take half an hour off journey' |last=McKinney |first=Seamus |date=2008-06-12 |publisher=The Irish News |accessdate=2008-06-14[/tpl] The £86 million plan will reduce the journey time to Belfast by 30 minutes and allow commuter trains to arrive before 9 a.m. for the first time. Many still do not use the train, because, at over two hours, it is slower centre-to-centre than the 100-minute Ulsterbus Goldline Express service.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/bdotg/action/detail?site=191&type=RESOURCES&itemId=5000218567 |title=Doing business in County Londonderry |accessdate=2008-06-15[/tpl]

====Railway history====

Throughout the first half of the 20th century the city was served by four different railways that between them linked the city with much of the province of Ulster, plus a harbour railway network that linked the other four lines. There was also a tramway on the City side of the Foyle.

=====19th and 20th century growth=====

Derry's first railway was the Irish gauge ([tpl]RailGauge|5ft3in[/tpl]) Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway (L&ER). Construction began in 1845 from a temporary station at Cow Market on the City side of the Foyle, reached Strabane in 1847[tpl]cite book |last=Hajducki |first=S. Maxwell |authorlink= |year=1974 |title=A Railway Atlas of Ireland |location=Newton Abbott |publisher=David & Charles |isbn=0-7153-5167-2 |at=map 3[/tpl] and was extended from Cow Market to its permanent terminus at Foyle Road in 1850.Hajducki, op. cit., inset to map 2 The L&ER reached Omagh in 1852 and Enniskillen in 1854, and was absorbed into the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) in 1883.[tpl]cite book |last=Patterson |first=Edward M |year=1962 |title=The County Donegal Railways |publisher=David & Charles |location=Dawlish |pages=10–11[/tpl]
The Londonderry and Coleraine Railway (L&CR), also Irish gauge, reached the city in 1852 and opened its terminus at Waterside. The Belfast and Northern Counties Railway leased the line from 1861 and took it over in 1871.
The Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway opened between Farland Point on Lough Swilly and a temporary terminus at Pennyburn in 1863. In 1866 it extended from Pennyburn to its permanent terminus at Graving Dock. The L&LSR was Irish gauge until 1885, when it was converted to [tpl]RailGauge|3ft[/tpl] narrow gauge for through running with the Letterkenny Railway.
The Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners (LPHC) linked Graving Dock and Foyle Road stations with a railway through Middle Quay in 1867, and linked this line with Waterside station by a railway over the new Carlisle Bridge in 1868. The bridge was replaced in 1933 with the double-deck Craigavon Bridge, with the LPHC railway on its lower deck.
In 1900 the [tpl]RailGauge|3ft[/tpl] gauge Donegal Railway extended from Strabane to Derry, establishing a terminus at Victoria Road. This was next to Carlisle Bridge and had a junction with the LPHC railway. The LPHC line was altered to dual gauge which allowed [tpl]RailGauge|3ft[/tpl] gauge traffic between the Donegal Railway and L&LSR as well as Irish gauge traffic between the GNR and B&NCR. In 1906 the Northern Counties Committee (NCC, successor to the B&NCR) and the GNR jointly took over the Donegal Railway, making it the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee (CDRJC).
The United Kingdom Government subsidised both the L&LSR and the Donegal Railway to build long extensions into remote parts of County Donegal. By 1905 these served much of the county,Hajducki, op. cit., maps 2, 3 & 6 making Derry (and also Strabane) a key rail hub for the county.
The City of Derry Tramways was opened in 1897.Hajducki, op. cit., page xvii This was a standard gauge ([tpl]RailGauge|sg[/tpl]) line served by horse trams and was never electrified. The tramway had only one line, was [tpl]convert|1.5|mi[/tpl] long, and ran along the City side of the Foyle parallel to the LPHC's line on that side of the river.Hajducki, op. cit., map 3 It was closed in 1919.

=====20th century decline=====

The partition of Ireland in 1922 turned the boundary with County Donegal into an international frontier. This changed trade patterns to the railways' detriment and placed border posts on every line to and from Derry except the NCC route to [tpl]rws|Coleraine[/tpl]. The L&LSR crossed the border between Pennyburn and Bridge End, the CDRJC crossed just beyond Strabane, and the GNR line crossed twice between Derry and Strabane. Stops for customs inspections greatly delayed trains and disrupted timekeeping.
Over the next few years customs agreements between the two states enabled GNR trains to and from Derry to pass through the Free State without inspection unless they were scheduled to serve local stations on the west bank of the Foyle, and for goods on all railways to be carried between different parts of the Free State to pass through Northern Ireland under customs bond. However, local passenger and goods traffic continued to be delayed by customs examinations.
In the 1920s and 30s and again after the Second World War the railways also faced increasing road competition. The L&LSR closed its line in 1953, followed by the CDRJC in 1954.Hajducki, op. cit., map 39 The Ulster Transport Authority took over the NCC in 1949 and the GNR's lines in Northern Ireland in 1958. The UTA also took over the LPHC railway, which it closed in 1962.[tpl]cite book |last=Baker |first=Michael H.C. |authorlink= |year=1972 |title=Irish Railways since 1916 |location=London |publisher=Ian Allan |isbn=0711002827 |page=209[/tpl] In accordance with The Benson Report submitted to the Northern Ireland Government in 1963, the UTA closed the former GNR line to Derry in 1965.Baker, op. cit., page 155
Since 1965 the former L&CR line has been Derry's sole railway link. As such it has carried not only passenger services between Derry and Belfast but also CIÉ freight services using Derry as a railhead for Donegal.

===Road network===

The road network has historically seen under-investment and has lacked good road connections to both Belfast and Dublin for many years.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] Long overdue, the largest road investment in the north west's history is now (2010) taking place with building of the 'A2 Broadbridge Maydown to City of Derry Airport dualling' project[tpl]cite web|url=http://roadimprovements.roadsni.gov.uk/index/schemes/broadbridge/a2_broadbridge_exhibition_panels_2.htm |title=A2 BroadBridge Maydown to City of Derry Airport Dualling Exhibition Panels | Road Improvements | Road Service Northern Ireland |publisher=Roadimprovements.roadsni.gov.uk |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2010-06-20[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] and announcement of the 'A6 Londonderry to Dungiven Dualling Scheme'[tpl]cite web|url=http://roadimprovements.roadsni.gov.uk/index/schemes/londonderry-dungiven.htm |title=A6 Londonderry to Dungiven Dualling Scheme | Road Improvements | Road Service Northern Ireland |publisher=Roadimprovements.roadsni.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-06-20[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] which will help to reduce the travel time to Belfast.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/roads/a6dungiventoderry.html |title=75% of the journey upon completion will be on either High Quality Dual Carriageway or Motorway Standard Roads. |publisher=www.wesleyjohnston.com/roads |accessdate=2006-09-22[/tpl] The latter project brings a dual-carriageway link between Northern Ireland's two largest cities one step closer.

It is not yet known if these two separate projects will connect at any point, although there have been calls for some form of connection between the two routes. In June 2008 Conor Murphy, Minister for Regional Development, announced that there will be a study into the feasibility of connecting the A5 and A6. Should it proceed, the scheme would most likely run from Drumahoe to south of Prehen along the south east of the City.

===Sea===

Londonderry Port at Lisahally is the United Kingdom's most westerly port and has capacity for 30,000-ton vessels. The Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners (LPHC) announced record turnover, record profits and record tonnage figures for the year ended March 2008. The figures are the result of a significant capital expenditure programme for the period 2000 to 2007 of about £22 million. Tonnage handled by LPHC increased almost 65% between 2000 and 2007, according to the latest[tpl]when|date=October 2011[/tpl] annual results.
The port gave vital Allied service in the longest running campaign of the Second World War, the Battle of the Atlantic, and saw the surrender of the German U-Boat fleet at Lisahally on 8 May 1945.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/aug/20/secondworldwar.northernireland |title=Raise the U-boat: council plans to put Nazi sub in maritime museum |last=Bowcott |first=Owen |date=20 August 2007 |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |accessdate=19 June 2008 | location=London[/tpl]

===Inland waterways===

The tidal River Foyle is navigable from the coast at Derry to approximately 10 miles inland. In 1796, the Strabane Canal was opened, continuing the navigation a further 4 miles southwards to Strabane. The canal was closed in 1962.

==Education==

Derry is home to the Magee Campus of the University of Ulster, formerly Magee College. However Lockwood'sA History of Magee College University of Ulster website 1960s decision to locate Northern Ireland's second university in Coleraine rather than Derry helped contribute to the formation of the civil rights movement that ultimately led to The Troubles. Derry was the town more closely associated with higher learning, with Magee College already more than a century old by that time.A history of Irish Theatre Google booksNorthern Ireland during the 1960s www.irelandseye.com In the mid-1980s a half-hearted attempt was made at rectifying this mistake by forming Magee College as a campus of the University of Ulster but this has failed to stifle calls for the establishment of an independent University in Derry that can grow to it full potential.Derry needs big idea to get over depression[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] Irish News website 2009-02-01 The campus has never thrived and currently only has 3,500 students out of a total University of Ulster student population of 27,000.

===Media===

The local papers the Derry Journal (known as the Londonderry Journal until 1880) and the Londonderry Sentinel reflect the divided history of the city: the Journal was founded in 1772 and is Ireland's second oldest newspaper; the Sentinel newspaper was formed in 1829 when new owners of the Journal embraced Catholic Emancipation, and the editor left the paper to set up the Sentinel. There are numerous radio stations receivable: the largest stations based in the city are BBC Radio Foyle[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radiofoyle/ |title=Northern Ireland - Radio Foyle |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2010-06-20[/tpl] and the commercial station Q102.9.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.q102.fm/portal/ |title=Q102.9 FM |publisher=Q102.fm |accessdate=2010-06-20[/tpl] There was a locally based television station, C9TV, one of only two local or 'restricted' television services in Northern Ireland, which ceased broadcasts in 2007.
