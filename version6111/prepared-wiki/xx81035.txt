==History==

Avesnes was founded in the 11th century.[tpl]Cite EB1911|wstitle=Avesnes[/tpl] The first known lord was Wedric II of Avesnes (born about 990), son of Wedric I de Morvois. The house of Avesnes played an important role in the low countries, including several Counts of Holland. Historically a part of the County of Hainaut, it became French in 1659 as a result of the Treaty of the Pyrenees. 
Avesnes was heavily fortified, with fortifications that were  continually modernised, from the 11th century up until 1867 when its fortifications, like those of other isolated bastions, were deemed to be redundant. In the 1870 some of the fortifications were demolished to allow easier access to the town.[tpl]cite web |first=Dominic |last=Goode |date=8 October 2011 |url=http://www.fortified-places.com/avesnes/ |title=Avesnes-sur-Helpe |publisher=Fortified Places |accessdate=March 2014[/tpl]
