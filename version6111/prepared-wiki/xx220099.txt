The Public Notary system was first established between the 1930s to the 1940s. It was enacted into legislation in 1935 by the government of the Republic of China. After the Chinese Civil War, the People's Republic of China in 1951 continued with developing the Public Notary system.

It created many offices in provincial counties and towns to make it accessible to the common people.http://www.legalinfo.gov.cn/english/LegalService/legalservice2_1.htm
During the period between 1958 and 1959, the Public Notary system languished and due to Cultural Revolution it virtually came to a standstill for the next two decades. The Cultural Revolution expelled the bourgeoisie and capitalist, nationalizing private property, private ownership of businesses and land were prohibited and turn into collective public ownership. This reduced the demand for notarization of documents and legal services.http://www.legalinfo.gov.cn/english/LegalService/legalservice2_1.htm
It was not until 1978 with the central government embarking on market economic reforms that the Public Notary system became very important and relevant.
