==Album information==

Among the Living was produced by Anthrax and Eddie Kramer. It includes the singles, "I Am the Law" and "Indians". The video for "Indians" received substantial rotation on MTV.
The cover of Among the Living depicts the character Rev. Henry Kane, antagonist from the Poltergeist series of films. It has been said to depict the character Randall Flagg, the subject of the album's title track, the antagonist from the Stephen King novel The Stand, but drummer Charlie Benante denies this, claiming "I wasn't thinking about The Stand when I had the idea" for the cover.[tpl]cite web |url=http://puregrainaudio.com/features/anthrax-s-among-the-living-the-intriguing-painting-behind-a-thrash-metal-masterpiece |title=...And Justice For Art: Anthrax's "Among The Living" - An Intriguing Painting for a Thrash Metal Masterpiece |accessdate=2013-05-02[/tpl]
"I Am the Law" is based on the comic book character Judge Dredd.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=126977 |title=ANTHRAX's 'Among The Living' Digitally Remastered And Expanded For CD+DVD Deluxe Edition |accessdate=2009-09-15[/tpl] Numerous characters, settings and story elements from Dredd's fictional universe are referenced in the song's lyrics. "A Skeleton in the Closet" is inspired by the Stephen King novella "Apt Pupil".
This was the final Anthrax album to feature songwriting contributions from original bassist Danny Lilker, who, despite having left the band after 1984's Fistful of Metal, was credited as the co-writer of several Anthrax songs for the next two albums. On Among the Living, he is credited as the co-writer of the songs "I Am the Law" and "Imitation of Life".
The album was dedicated to the memory of Metallica bassist Cliff Burton, a highly regarded figure in the thrash community, with whom they were label mates at Megaforce Records and who died six months prior to the album's release.
On November 10, 2009, a deluxe edition of the album was released which included a bonus concert DVD. The deluxe edition featured alternate takes of several album tracks, live versions and "I Am the Law" b-side, "Bud E Luv Bomb And Satan's Lounge Band".[tpl]cite web |work=Blabbermouth.net |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=126977 |title=ANTHRAX's 'Among The Living' Digitally Remastered And Expanded For CD+DVD Deluxe Edition |accessdate=2010-11-23[/tpl]
