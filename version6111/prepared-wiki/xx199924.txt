Clark Kent is a fictional character on the television series Smallville. The character of Clark Kent, first created for comic books by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1938 as the alternate identity of Superman, was adapted to television in 2001 by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, the fourth time the character has been adapted to a live-action television series. Clark Kent has been played continually by Tom Welling, with various other actors portraying Clark as a child. The character has also appeared in various literature based on the Smallville series, all of which are completely independent of the television episodes. As of 2011, Smallville[tpl]'[/tpl]s Clark Kent has appeared in eighteen young adult novels.
In the series, Clark Kent attempts to live the life of a normal human being, and struggles with keeping the secret of his alien heritage from his friends. He has an on-again, off-again relationship with Lana Lang through the first seven seasons, the trials of which are based on his lack of honesty about his secret. In contrast to previous incarnations of the character, this Clark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life. The pair's friendship eventually deteriorates into hatred for one another. In Smallville, Clark's powers appear over time, as he is not aware of all of them at the start of the show; for instance, his heat vision and super breath do not develop until season two and six, respectively.
When developing Smallville[tpl]'s[/tpl] version of Clark Kent, the producers decided to strip him down to the "... bare essence ..." of Superman; he is also fallible, which allows the audience to see his humanity, but that he is also "... good to the core". In the series, he has been seen by critics, and intentionally portrayed by the filmmakers, as a symbolic representation of Jesus Christ. Tom Welling has been nominated for multiple Teen Choice and Saturn Awards for his portrayal of Clark Kent since the show's first season.

==Role in Smallville==

Clark Kent first appears in the pilot episode of Smallville as a teen with superhuman abilities that he uses to help others. Clark is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole) as an infant, when he crash lands on Earth on the day of the Smallville meteor shower in 1989. Twelve years later, trying to find his place in life after being told he is an alien by his adoptive father, Clark saves the life of Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), the son of billionaire Lionel Luthor (John Glover), and the pair become quick friends.[tpl]cite episode|title=Pilot|series=Smallville|credits=Alfred Gough, Miles Millar (writers) & David Nutter (director)|network=The WB|airdate=October 16, 2001|season=1|number=1|minutes=42[/tpl] During season one, Clark struggles with the burden of keeping his powers a secret from those close to him.

==Portrayal==

In October 2000, producers Al Gough and Miles Millar began their search for the three lead roles, and had casting directors in ten different cities looking at actors. After months of scouting, Tom Welling was cast as Clark Kent. Jensen Ackles, the runner up for the role of Clark Kent, would go on to play Jason Teague as a season four regular.[tpl]cite book|author=Byrne, Craig|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 4|publisher=Titan Books|date=September 4, 2007|page=124|isbn=1-84023-957-3[/tpl] Besides Welling, four other actors have portrayed Clark as young boy/teenager: Malkolm Alburquenque portrayed a three-year-old Clark in the pilot, and season two episode "Lineage";[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/episode/20946/Smallville/overview|title=Pilot overview|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 31, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/episode/29774/Smallville/overview|title=Lineage overview|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 31, 2008[/tpl] Brandon Fonseca played young Clark in the season five episode "Vengeance";[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/episode/54231/Smallville/overview|title=Vengeance overview|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 31, 2008[/tpl] and in the season eight episode "Abyss", Jackson Warris would fill the role.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/episode/82644/Smallville/overview|title=Abyss overview|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 31, 2008[/tpl] In addition, in an alternate reality in the seventh season episode "Apocalypse", a teenaged Clark Kent was portrayed by Brett Dier.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/episode/74859/Smallville/overview|title=Apocalypse overview|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 31, 2008[/tpl]
The pilot director, David Nutter, was looking through pictures of actors and stumbled on Tom Welling's image. When he asked about Welling, the casting director said Welling's manager did not want him to do the role because it could hurt his feature film career. After a conversation with Welling's manager, Nutter got Welling to read the script for the pilot, which convinced him to do the part.[tpl]cite video|title="Pilot" commentary by Al Gough, Miles Millar and David Nutter|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Bros. Television|year=2002[/tpl] Welling's initial fears were quelled after reading the script, when he realized that the show was not about Clark "... being a super hero ...," but more about the character attempting to live a normal life as a teenager.
When Tom Welling auditioned for the role he was not sure how to prepare. While waiting for his turn, he realized that the character is one thing above all else: "... a high school kid ...." To Welling, simply acting like he was a normal teenager, instead of like a super hero, was the perfect way to embody the character. Welling realized that by doing that, the special effects and other production elements would fill in the holes and perfect the character on screen. For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene with Kristin Kreuk (the first actor to be cast for the show), and the network thought they had "... great chemistry".Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion) pp.8–17

Welling was generally unfamiliar with the Superman mythology, so much so that when an episode of Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman aired on television, which featured Clark learning about his Kryptonian heritage, Welling immediately turned the show off. According to Welling, he wanted to learn about Clark's heritage simultaneously to Clark learning about it on Smallville. Welling believed that it was important for him to learn with the character, to help him be the Clark Kent envisioned by Al Gough and Miles Millar.Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.112-115 The actor believed his lack of knowledge of the Superman mythology helped his performance, because Gough and Millar set up the series so that the previous mythology was not as important. Welling also enjoyed that he was in the same predicament as Clark with neither knowing the future of the character, beyond the fact that he will be Superman. When Welling landed the role of Clark Kent he was sent various Superman-related gifts, including books and toys, which Welling planned to leave unopened until the show was over. Welling was adamant from the beginning that he did not sign on to play Superman, and had no intention of wearing the costume. While filming, Welling was allowed input into how his character responded in certain situations, including moving the scene between rooms, or requesting the director film particular mannerisms to emphasize a specific emotion.[tpl]cite video|people=Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, Greg Beeman, Ken Horton, and Michael Rosenbaum|title=Commentary for season three's episode "Exile"|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Home Video|year=2004[/tpl][tpl]cite video|people=James Marshall, John Glover and Allison Mack|title=Commentary for season three's episode "Truth"|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Home Video|year=2004[/tpl]

==Character development==

===Storyline progression===

Early in the series, Clark was still learning how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was to fit in with his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers "... alienates him from others". Welling reasoned that by the end of season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three: "If you can't fight them, you might as well join them ... he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run."[tpl]cite book|author=Simpson, Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 3|publisher=Titan Books|date=September 1, 2005|pages=116–119|isbn=1-84023-952-2[/tpl] 
A significant moment in the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict between him and his father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a "... callback to Hothead ..." in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow.Byrne, Craig, (Season 4 Companion) pp.  112–115 Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, "... Clark learned a little bit more about what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has." The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer.Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg. 66 Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow. John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg. 132
Writer Holly Harold noted that the introduction of Green Arrow (Justin Hartley) allowed Clark to mature more in the sixth season. Clark was able to see how others achieved the same goals, but used alternative routes that perhaps crossed moral lines. This taught Clark to start thinking about things from his opponents' perspectives. Ultimately, in season six Clark learned it would be his human side that allowed him to become the hero he needed to be, summed up by writer Turi Meyer as "... soon-to-be Man of Steel".[tpl]cite book|author=Byrne, Craig|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 6|publisher=Titan Books|date=March 2008|pages=112–115|location=London|isbn=1-84576-656-3[/tpl] Each season, Clark gained insight into how not to misuse his abilities from the kryptonite-mutated villains that used them for crime. In later seasons, Clark saw how even those that used their abilities for good might still have questionable actions, specifically Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) and Andrea Rojas (Denise Quiñones), though Clark did help them take the high road. Those episodes reiterated the effect Clark's parents had on how he used his abilities. Clark also learned that he cannot do everything alone, even though he chose not to join Oliver's team of superheroes at the end of the episode "Justice". For Meyer, season six showed that Clark was still struggling to accept his destiny, but did take steps toward the day that he would put on the cape and become Superman.

===Characterization===

The idea Gough and Millar came up with for their show's version of Clark Kent was to strip him down to his "... bare essence ...", discovering the reasons why Clark became Superman. In Smallville, Clark is fallible, as Gough explains:  The thing that we've tried to portray...is that Clark doesn't always make the right decisions, and by not making the right decisions, he brings further consequences on himself. Whether it's running away from Jor-El at the end of season two, or choosing humanity over some sort of Kryptonian mission, those decisions get him in more trouble, and cause more people to suffer, or in Jonathan Kent's case, to die.  Welling agreed with Gough's opinion of Clark's fallibility, stating that the mistakes Clark made showed his humanity.
Even though Clark could make the wrong choices, season five's "Aqua" helped illustrate the concept that Clark was "... good to the core". The episode showed how protective he could be over someone, even when that person annoyed him. In this case, he was trying to warn Lois that Arthur Curry may not have been the man she believed him to be.Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg.124 This concept was echoed by the Seattle Times' Julia Waterhous, who noted that Clark, despite all his flaws, always put others before himself. Welling's fellow actors also had their own insights into the character. Kristin Kreuk saw Clark as a kindred spirit who was sad, lonely, but also endearing;Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pg.116 whereas John Schneider classified Clark as a special needs child.Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pg.140
Just like his comic book counterpart, Smallville's Clark Kent was a symbolic representation of Jesus Christ. Established early on, the pilot episode contained a moment when Clark was crucified on a scarecrow post during a high school hazing.[tpl]cite news|author=Judge Bryan Byun|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason1.php|title=Season 1 DVD review|publisher=DVD Verdict|date=November 24, 2003|accessdate=August 20, 2008[/tpl] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Rob Owen noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene, stating, "Is it any wonder Clark gets tied up there since Superman, too, was 'sent to save us'?"[tpl]cite news|author=Rob Owen|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20011014smallvilletv2.asp|title=Superman revisited in "Smallville"|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=October 14, 2001|accessdate=July 8, 2007|authorlink=Rob Owen (journalist)[/tpl] Echoing Owen, Judge Byun identified the same symbolism: "Superman is, in a way, the secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ, a messiah figure for our generation. The series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode, in which Clark is symbolically 'crucified' in a cornfield. That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation of the series; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all for the greater good of humanity, and Smallville shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role."
This was extended to the end of season nine, where Clark sacrificed his own life in the finale, in order to send General Zod and the rest of the Kandorians to their own world. In doing so, Clark fell off a building "... in full crucifixion pose, driving home the point that he is sacrificing himself for the good of the planet".[tpl]cite web|author=Carlos Delgado|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=4071|title=TV Review: Smallville — Season Nine Finale - 'Salvation'|publisher=ifMagazine|date=May 15, 2010|accessdate=September 26, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] To this point, Cinemafantastique's Tom Powers suggested that these images and metaphorical emphasis through dialogue exchanges came across so heavy-handed that a very devout individual might have found them offensive.[tpl]cite web|author=Tom Powers|url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/05/smallvillesalvation-%e2%80%94-review/|title=Smallville:Salvation — Review|publisher=CinemafantastiqueOnline|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=September 26, 2010[/tpl]
In addition to religious allusions, the crew used color schemes and camera movements to create their own themes for the characters. Since the show was told from Clark's point of view, particular visual elements were utilized to illustrate a particular characteristic. When he was safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and gentle, with an earth tone, while the camera movement was gentle as well. When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, the lighting was more neutral, with greater camera movement. When there was danger, the lighting became colder, and the camera shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.

===Relationships===

Clark's relationships with the other characters evolved over the course of the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a yin and yang type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite.[tpl]cite video|title="Metamorphosis" commentary by Al Gough and Miles Millar|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Bros. Television|year=2002[/tpl] His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.
His relationship with Lana Lang was one of Smallville's central relationships. When Clark and Lana met in the cemetery, Clark realized that he had found someone who understood him, who he could talk to, even though it was not in as strong a way as he would have liked. Although Clark felt close to Lana, his fear that she would "... kick him out of her life ..." if she learned his secret — that he came in the meteor shower that killed her parents — was strong enough to keep him from becoming as close to her as he wished. The lack of honesty caused issues between them. Judge Byun wondered how this Clark Kent would have room in his heart for Lois Lane later in life, as the he bounced back and forth between Lana and Chloe in the first season.
With Lana's boyfriend gone by season two, the door opened for Clark, but Welling stated he understood why the producers continued to keep Clark and Lana apart, even after Whitney's departure: "There's the cliché that television shows with a main lover interest fail once they get it together." After briefly being together at the beginning of the fifth season, Clark's upbringing was not enough to help him cope with the loss of Lana to Lex toward the end of season five. Welling admits that Clark had learned to let Lana make her own choices and not stand in her way, but his problem with her relationship with Lex was that Lex is a dangerous individual and it put Lana's safety in jeopardy. Apart from that, Clark had learned to walk the lonely road of a hero. His inability to cope with Lana moving on with Lex was carried over to season six. This season was the time the writers put Clark through an emotional wringer when they had Lana accept Lex's marriage proposal. For writer Kelly Souders, this presented Clark's worst fear: the woman he loved was marrying his worst enemy.
Apart from Lana, Clark had an growing relationship with Lois. Season five saw the melting of the ice between the two characters, who continued to butt heads. Executive producer Darren Swimmer believed that the audience could finally start to see a growing attraction between the two, and the fact that both would be there for the other in a time of need. Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if that notion was true.Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pp.124-127 In season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a "brother and sister friendship" label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels.Byrne, Craig, (Season 6 Companion) pp. 124-127 By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept the idea that she may be in love with Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life.[tpl]cite web|author=Rachel Thomas|url=http://tvdramas.about.com/od/smallville/a/ericaduranceint.htm|title=Interview with Erica Durance (Lois, 'Smallville')|publisher=About.com|date=September 2008|accessdate=October 18, 2008[/tpl] His relationship with Lois was included in TV Guide[tpl]'[/tpl]s list of the best TV couples of all time.[tpl]cite web|title=Couples Pictures, Smallville Photos — Photo Gallery: The Best TV Couples of All Time|url=http://www.tvguide.com/PhotoGallery/Best-TV-Couples-1026715/1026726|work=TV Guide|accessdate=June 25, 2012[/tpl]

===Costume===

For most of the series, Clark did not wear any sort of costume when in his superhero persona. From seasons one through eight, Clark was typically dressed in either red, yellow and blue (the traditional colors of the Superman costume), or in the All-American colors of red, white, and blue.[tpl]cite video|people=Al Gough, Miles Millar, Greg Beeman, Kent Horton, and Michael Rosenbaum|title="Memoria" commentary|format=DVD|publisher=Warner Bros. Television[/tpl] This included the primary usage of either a blue t-shirt underneath a red jacket, or a red t-shirt worn under a blue jacket.Visual observation used as example to further illustrate what Millar and Gough said in previous quote In season nine, the producers decided to design an actual costume for Clark to wear while patrolling the streets of Metropolis. Abandoning the theme of red, blue, and yellow, the producers chose to keep the costume completely black, save for a silver Superman "S" shield painted on the front. Instead of the traditional cape, Clark's red jacket is traded for a black trenchcoat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fancast.com/blogs/2010/tv-news/the-big-tease-scoop-on-greys-ncis-mentalist-more/ |title=The Big Tease: Scoop on ‘Grey's,' ‘NCIS' and More | Fancast News |publisher=Fancast.com |date=February 23, 2010 |accessdate=July 24, 2010[/tpl] This drew comparison to the character of Neo from The Matrix film series.

In the season ten premiere, the audience got its first glimpse of the traditional Superman costume, which was left for Clark by Martha in the season nine finale. Although the suit was briefly seen through a reflection in Clark's eyes in the season nine finale,[tpl]Cite web|author=Krystal Clark|url=http://screencrave.com/2010-07-28/smallville-season-10-trailer-flight-and-tights/ |title=Smallville Season 10 Trailer – Flight and Tights? |publisher=Screencrave.com |date=July 28, 2010|accessdate=September 28, 2010[/tpl] the suit that appeared in the season ten premiere was a different design. The producers, working alongside Warner Bros. and DC Comics, procured the costume worn by Brandon Routh in Superman Returns, which the team chose over the Christopher Reeve suit of the 1980s.[tpl]cite web|author=Rick Marshall|url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/09/24/smallville-season-10-characters-end/|title='Smallville' Producers On Season 10, Character Choices, And Why 'The Story Doesn't End Here'|publisher=MTV.com|date=September 24, 2010|accessdate=September 27, 2010[/tpl] DC Comics offered the suit worn by Reeve, but Peterson explained that it "... just didn't quite fit with our world."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.kryptonsite.com/cc10-brianpeterson.htm|title=Interview With Smallville Executive Producers Kelly Souders & Brian Peterson — Comic-Con 2010 |publisher=KryptonSite|accessdate=July 28, 2010[/tpl] According to producer Kelly Souders, "Well, the process was really a group effort. We worked with DC, and we have Alicia Louis, who does a lot of stuff for us at the studio, and who was really instrumental. It took quite a bit to get that costume. There's a lot of sign-offs, it really was Warner Bros. and DC and us working to make it happen." Peterson confirmed that the costume would play a more prominent role in the final season, even hinting that the last scene of Smallville would see Clark wearing it. In the meantime, Clark began wearing a new costume in the season ten episode "Shield". Here, Clark replaced the black trenchoat with a red leather jacket, and the "S" shield is now embossed onto the chest of that jacket.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/VoicesFromKrypton/news/?a=23362|title=Clark Kent's New "Uniform" on Smallville|publisher=Comic Book Movie|date=October 2, 2010|accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]

Bryan Byun, of DVD Verdict, believes that Welling was the perfect choice for Clark Kent: "I can't imagine a more ideal actor to play this superpowered farm boy than Tom Welling, with his wholesome, honest face and heroic good looks—Welling not only resembles Christopher Reeve physically, but has all of the earnest charm that made Reeve the quintessential Superman."

In 2012, the series was continued in Smallville: Season 11, a comic book available both in e-versions and in print. Every Friday for three weeks in a row, the stories which follow the primary story arcs, were released online and were referred to as episodes. The following week, the preceding three episodes were released as a print comic. Parallel to the main story arc, other story arcs featuring other characters (many of which were part of the future "Justice League America") were released online every fourth Friday, and collected and printed in special editions by themselves, separate from the main story.
