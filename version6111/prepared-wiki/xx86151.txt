James L. Pavitt (born February 19, 1946) was Deputy Director for Operations (DDO) for the CIA from 1999 until June 4, 2004. His sudden resignation – as well as that of his chief, DCI George Tenet the previous day – led to speculation that it was over the controversy surrounding Iraq weapons of mass destruction or 9-11 intelligence issues.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]

Bush.James L. Pavitt Biography, http://www.patriotdefensegroup.com/pavitt.php, Patriot Defense Group  After being assigned to work across the Agency operational/analytical divide in the Directorate of Intelligence, he became the founder and first Chief of the Directorate of Operation's Counterproliferation Division (CPD).  Gordon Oehler, then Chief of the Directorate of Intelligence's Non-Proliferation Center, criticized this as being redundant and stepping on his turf.  Pavitt hand picked operations officers, some of which were Nonofficial Cover Officers (NOCs) including Valerie Plame, to staff the CPD.  In 1997 he was appointed Associate Deputy Director of Operations.  He was Deputy Director of Operations from 1999 until his resignation in 2004.[tpl]cite web | url = http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/2/hi/americas/3775423.stm | title = Second top official to quit CIA | accessdate = 2009-04-15[/tpl]  In 2003, the CPD took down the nuclear black market being operated by Abdul Qadeer Khan.
After September 11, 2001, Pavitt was responsible for sending Special Activities Division teams to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Somalia to capture Al Qaeda members.  The first Hellfire missiles fired from drones were under his command.  They were aimed at an Al Qaeda convoy in Sudan in which all occupants, including an American citizen, were killed.
In April 2004 he appeared before the 9/11 Commission. The BBC called his 9/11 commission appearance 'unprecedented'. The commission's report said that shortly after Bush's election, Pavitt told the President-elect that Osama bin Laden was one of the gravest threats to the country. He also added that killing the Al Qaeda leader would have an effect but not stop the threat posed by the terrorist organization.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20349-2004Mar24.html | work=The Washington Post | date=March 24, 2004 | accessdate=May 5, 2010[/tpl]
When Bush put Porter Goss in charge of the agency, Pavitt reportedly opposed the internal reorganizations announced by Goss, on the ground that they might "do damage to a strategic effort that has produced excellent work on terrorism and a variety of other important issues."http://www.washtimes.com/national/20041119-124355-9178r.htm On June 4, 2004, he unexpectedly announced his retirement one day after George Tenet. The CIA says Pavitt's decision was unconnected with Tenet's departure.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] Pavitt was succeeded by his deputy, Stephen Kappes.
