Major Goals

==Structure==

The FGC is overseen by a committee of 149 Friends, 81 of whom are appointed by affiliated yearly and monthly meetings. The work of the FGC is carried out by the staff and volunteer members of its program committees.

==The Gathering==

A key program of FGC is the annual Gathering of Friends held at a different college campus every July. The event usually attracts 1,200 to 1,500 attenders from around the world, but most participants come from the United States and Canada. The event features 40â€“60 workshop and a slate of plenary speakers. Topics covered include Quaker faith and practice, arts and crafts, multigenerational programming, and political activism. The Gathering hosts both Quaker and non-Quaker speakers focusing on messages of interest to Quakers. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. offered a Plenary presentation in 1958. More recently, the Gathering hosted Lester Brown, Shane Claiborne, and Ben Pink Dandelion.
In addition to workshops and plenary sessions, the gathering often features special events such as concerts. Renowned folk singer Pete Seeger performed a concert in 1997.  Evalyn Parry, older sister of FGC attender Richard Parry - of the Arcade Fire, has also performed several times at FGC, including in 2002, 2006, and 2011.

==Other Organizations==

There are two other similar organizations within Quakerism, Friends United Meeting and Evangelical Friends Church International; each of these three organizations represent different branches within Quakerism, with the FUM occupying a more-or-less centrist theological viewpoint and the EFCI representing an admixture of Quakerism and conservative evangelicalism.
From an early on,The Conference was described as "Liberal" in secular media:  [tpl]cite news |title=Calendar |url=http://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n54/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Jul 13, 1914 |accessdate=August 5, 2012[/tpl] Friends (Quakers) in FGC tend to be decidedly more socially and theologically liberal than Friends from other parts of Quakerism. In many respects, they are analogous to mainline Protestants who hold strongly progressive viewpoints on matters such as biblical authority, sexual mores, and attitudes toward public policy, with pacifism perhaps being the FGC's chief distinctive.

The precursor conferences were officially joined together as the Friends General Conference at Chautauqua, New York in August 1900.
