[[Demethylation]]

CATEGORIES: Gene expression, Organic reactions

Demethylation is the chemical process resulting in the removal of a methyl group (CH3) from a molecule.[tpl]Clayden1st[/tpl][tpl]March6th[/tpl] A common way of demethylation is the replacement of a methyl group by a hydrogen atom, resulting in a net loss of one carbon and two hydrogen atoms.

==In biochemistry==

In biochemical systems, the process of demethylation is catalyzed by demethylases.  These enzymes oxidize N-methyl groups, which occur in histones and some forms of DNA.
One such oxidative enzyme family is the cytochrome P450[tpl]cite book | author = Roland Sigel; Sigel, Astrid; Sigel, Helmut | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The Ubiquitous Roles of Cytochrome P450 Proteins: Metal Ions in Life Sciences | edition = | language = | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2007 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-470-01672-8 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = [/tpl] Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent nonheme enzymes are active for demethylation of DNA, operating by similar pathway.

In organic chemistry, demethylation typically refers to the cleavage of ethers, especially aryl ethers, which are pervasive in lignin-derived compounds. The reaction typically requires harsh conditions or harsh reagents. For example, the methyl ether in vanillin can be removed by heating near 250 Â°C with strong base.[tpl]OrgSynth|author=Irwin A.

Boron tribromide is a classical reagent for the dealkylation of methyl arylethers. The mechanism of ether dealkylation proceeds via the formation of a complex between the boron center and the ether oxygen followed by the elimination of an alkyl bromide to yield a dibromo(organo)borane.  The dibromo(organo)borane can then undergo hydrolysis to give the alcohol or phenol, boric acid, and hydrogen bromide as products.[tpl]OrgSynth|author= J. F. W. McOmie, D. E.

Methyl esters also are susceptible to demethylation, which is usually achieved by saponification.  Highly specialized demethylations are abundant such as the Krapcho decarboxylation:
