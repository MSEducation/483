[[Jejunum]]

CATEGORIES: Digestive system

The jejunum ([tpl]IPAc-en|dʒ|ɨ|ˈ|dʒ|uː|n|əm[/tpl]OED 2nd edition, 1989.Entry "jejunum" in Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary.) is the middle section of the small intestine in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear and the terms middle intestine or mid-gut may be used instead of jejunum.
The jejunum lies between the duodenum and the ileum. The change from the duodenum to the jejunum is usually defined as the Duodenojejunal flexure and is attached, and thus "hung up", to the ventricle (see stomach) by the ligament of Treitz.[tpl]cite journal |author=van Gijn J |title=Treitz and his ligament. |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. |volume=155 |issue=8 |year=2011 |pmid=21557825 |author-separator=, |author2=Gijselhart JP |display-authors=2[/tpl]
In adult humans, the small intestine is usually between 5.5 and 6m long, 2.5mThe Gale Group, Inc. (2008). Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine of which is the jejunum.
The pH in the jejunum is usually between 7 and 9 (neutral or slightly alkaline).
If the jejunum is impacted by blunt force the emesis reflex (vomiting) will be initiated.
The jejunum and the ileum are suspended by mesentery which gives the bowel great mobility within the abdomen. It also contains circular and longitudinal smooth muscle which helps to move food along by a process known as peristalsis.

==Structure==

The lumenal surface of the jejunum, is covered in finger like projections of mucosa, called villi, which increase the surface area of tissue available to absorb nutrients from ingested foodstuffs. The epithelial cells which line these villi have microvilli. The transport of nutrients across epithelial cells through the jejunum and ileum includes the passive transport of sugar fructose and the active transport of amino acids, small peptides, vitamins, and most glucose. The villi in the jejunum are much longer than in the duodenum or ileum.
The jejunum contains very few Brunner's glands (found in the duodenum) or Peyer's patches (found in the ileum). However, there are a few jejunal lymph nodes suspended in its mesentery. The jejunum has many large circular folds in its submucosa called plicae circulares which increase the surface area for nutrient absorption. The plicae circulares are the best developed in the jejunum. These structures help protect the jejunum in the event that it is punched or struck with blunt force, which can elicit a powerful emetic effect.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; the only source I can find with regards to punches to the jejunum triggering emesis is the movie Semi-Pro, although, in general, trauma to the GI tract can trigger vomiting through stimulation of mechanoreceptors to vagal afferents.|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Differences between jejunum and ileum===

There is no line of demarcation between the jejunum and the ileum.  However there are subtle histological differences:

==Function==

The lining of the jejunum is specialized for the absorption, by enterocytes, of small nutrient particles which have been previously digested by enzymes in the duodenum. Once absorbed, nutrients (with the exception of fat, which goes to the lymph) pass from the enterocytes into the enterohepatic circulation and enter the liver via the hepatic portal vein, where the blood is processed.

==History==

===Etymology===

Jejunum is derived from the Latin word jējūnus, meaning "fasting". It was so called because this part of the small intestine was frequently found to be void of food following death, thanks to intensive peristaltic activity compared to the duodenum and ileum.
The Early Modern English adjective jejune is derived from this word.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl]

==Alcoholic Beverage==

"Jejunum" is also the name of a discrete alcoholic cocktail that is commonly served on the high seas.  The beverage is 1 part flat, Diet Dr. Pepper and 1 part dark, spiced rum.  The cocktail is mixed at room temperature and served without ice.  Jejunum is the premiere pre-dinner cocktail on the open ocean.
