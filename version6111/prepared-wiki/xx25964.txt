Umberto I or Humbert I ([tpl]circa|980[/tpl] – 1042 or 1047/1048) (in French, Humbert aux blanches-mains; in Italian, Umberto Biancamano) was the first Count of Savoy from 1032, when the County of Vienne, which had been sold to the Archdiocese of Vienne, was divided between the County of Albon and Maurienne.

==Biography==

===Family===

Umberto was the son of Amadeus (who was perhaps count of Maurienne).Hellmann, Grafen, p. 2. By contrast, according to a late medieval legend, Umberto's father was a Saxon noble named Berold, who was the grandson of Emperor Otto II His brother was Bishop Otto of Belley. Umberto is the progenitor of the dynasty known as the House of Savoy. The origins of this dynasty are unknown, but Humbert's ancestors are variously said to have come from Saxony,[tpl]CathEncy|wstitle=Savoy[/tpl] Burgundy or Provence. Given Humbert's close connections with Rudolf III of Burgundy,For Umberto's relationship with Rudolf III, see Previté-Orton, Early History, pp. 9, 13ff.,26, 38, 47ff, it is likely that his family were Burgundian, and were descended either from the dukes of Vienne,Previté-Orton, Early History or from or a Burgundian aristocratic family (such as the Guigonids, ancestors of the counts of Albon).Ducourthial, ‘Géographie du pouvoir'
Umberto initially held lands around Belley and in the county of Sermorens,Ducourthial, ‘Géographie,’ pp. 223-235 before gaining lands in Aosta and Valais.Previté-Orton, Early History, pp. 19ff., 90ff.

===Umberto Whitehands===

He is also called Umberto the White-Handed ([tpl]lang-fr|Humbert aux Blanches-Mains[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-it|Umberto Biancamano[/tpl]) reportedly to signify his generosity.  However, this posthumously applied title may derive from a misreading of a late medieval record (in Latin) which actually refers to the walls of his castle (blancis moenibus), not his hands (blancis manibus), as white.History of House of Savoy

===Umberto and empire===

After Rudolf III’s death (1032), Umberto I swore fealty to Emperor Conrad II.Previté-Orton, Early History, pp. 32f. He supported Conrad II in his campaigns against Odo II, Count of Blois and Archbishop Aribert of Milan.Previté-Orton, Early History, pp. 19, 30ff., 35, 41; Hellmann, Grafen, pp. 8ff. In return, Conrad II appointed Umberto count of Savoy and granted him Maurienne, Chablais and perhaps Tarentaise.Ducouthial, ‘Géographie,’pp. 235-238. By contrast, Hellmann, Grafen, p. 3 argues Umberto possessed Maurienne long before this.

===Marriage and children===

Umberto married Ancilla (Auxilia or Ancilia). She may have been Ancilla of Lenzburg, the daughter of the master of ceremonies of Burgundy. Alternatively, Ancilla may have been a daughter of Anselm and Aldiud, and thus a member of a northern Italian dynasty known as the Anselmids.On the identity of Umberto's wife, see Previté-Orton, Early History, pp. 10f., 19ff., 67f., 71; Die Urkunden der burgundischen Rudolfinger, p. 23 n.11.
With his wife, Umberto had at least four sons:
Some authors believe that he had additional sons.

===Death===

Umberto is often said to have died c.1047/8 at Hermillon, a town in the Maurienne region of present day Savoie, France.Previté-Orton, Early History, pp. 39f., 69; Hellmann, Grafen, p. 10 More recently, it has been suggested that he died by 1042.Ducourthial, ‘Géographie,’ p. 231 Umberto was buried in the cathedral of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne.
