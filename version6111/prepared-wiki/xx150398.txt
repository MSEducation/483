CATEGORIES: Charities based in France

Bibliothécaires Sans Frontières (or BSF; Librarians without Borders in English) is a charitable organisation based in France which provides books and support for libraries, mostly in the Francophone developing world.
It was formed in November 1999. Its first project, in 2000, was a youth library in Niger, followed in 2001 by two school libraries in India and - still ongoing - a project to provide books to a Kurdish refugee camp in Iraq. Two other ongoing projects are to support a university library in Russia (since 2002) and a youth library in Senegal (since 2005).
