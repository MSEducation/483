Gotthard Friedrich Stender ([tpl]lang-lv|Gothards Frīdrihs Stenders[/tpl]; 1714-1796) was the first Latvian grammarian and lexicographer, founder of the Latvian secular literature in the 18th century.  G.F. Stender in the spirit of the Enlightenment produced didactic tales and idyllic poems. The first Latvian popular encyclopedia of science «The Book of High Wisdom» was also written by him in 1774.
Gotthard Friedrich Stender played an outstanding role in Latvia's history of culture. He wrote secular poetry ranging from philosophical odas to the grandeur of nature to unpretencious folksy songs, which widely influenced the literary taste of the nation, and won extreme popularity. His works, although written mainly for the 18th century people, promoted the education in Latvian schools throughout the whole 19th century.
G.F.Stender updated Latvian ABC, compiled a comprehensive Latvian grammar book and a dictionary, which had been used not only by Latvians and German Balts, but also by foreign linguists from all Europe of the time period. G.F.Stender along with Johann Gottfried Herder was the first author, who analysed Latvian folksongs, riddles, proverbs and sayings.
