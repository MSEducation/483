Chello Zone (formerly Zone Vision, Zone Media) is a London, United Kingdom-based television company, founded in 1991 by Chris Wronski and owned by Chellomedia (AMC Networks).

==History==

The company was originally founded to distribute television programmes in Eastern Europe, but now operates in 138 countries. They operate channels under 7 brands, albeit with some limited to specific countries, and provide 22 sound tracks across these.
Its English speaking-targeted channels show mainly US and Canadian imports as well as older BBC and ITV produced content; whereas its Central European stations show large quantities of recent British television. Original sound tracks are provided on most shows which are dubbed.
On 14 September 2009, it was revealed that the international arm of CBS, CBS Studios International, struck a joint venture deal with Chellomedia to launch six CBS-branded channels in the UK during 2009. The new channels would replace Zone Romantica, Zone Thriller, Zone Horror and Zone Reality, plus timeshift services Zone Horror +1 and Zone Reality +1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsroom.zonemedia.net/Scripts/FileDownload.asp?fPath=D%3A%5CWWW%5FDomains%5CZONE%5FPRESS%5CFiles%5CPress%5CCBS+FINALChello+Zone+partnership+press+release%2Edoc|title=CBS FINALChello Zone partnership press release|format=DOC|publisher=Chello Zone|date=2009-09-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/international/cbs-to-launch-uk-channels-with-chellomedia/5005560.article|title=CBS to launch UK channels with Chellomedia|publisher=Broadcastnow|date=2009-09-14[/tpl] On 1 October 2009, it was announced that CBS Reality, CBS Reality +1, CBS Drama and CBS Action would launch on 16 November 2009 replacing Zone Reality, Zone Reality +1, Zone Romantica and Zone Thriller.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/international/cbs-channels-to-launch-in-uk/5006298.article|title=CBS channels to launch in UK|publisher=Broadcastnow|date=2009-10-01[/tpl]
