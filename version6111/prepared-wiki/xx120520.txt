Carlentini (Sicilian: Carruntini) is a town and comune in the Province of Syracuse, Sicily (Italy).
The city's name has its origins in the neighboring town of Lentini.  In 1551, Vice-King Giovanni De Vega founded a new city in honour of Emperor Carlo V, naming it in Latin Carleontini, or Leontini of Carlo.  In Italian, it became Carlentini, and in the various Sicilian dialects, Carrintini or Carruntini.
