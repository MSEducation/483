[[Half rhyme]]

CATEGORIES: Rhyme

Half rhyme or slant rhyme,  sometimes called near-rhyme or lazy rhyme, is a type of rhyme formed by words with similar but not identical sounds. In most instances, either the vowel segments are different while the consonants are identical, or vice versa. This type of rhyme is also called approximate rhyme, inexact rhyme, imperfect rhyme (in contrast to perfect rhyme), off rhyme, analyzed rhyme, or suspended rhyme.[tpl]cite book|author=Ian Ousby|title=The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Literature in English|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=43oBE1nJXaMC&pg=PA8|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=23 February 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43627-4|pages=8[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_S.html |title=Literary Terms and Definitions S |publisher=Web.cn.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20[/tpl]

==Use in hip hop/rap==

Half rhyme is often used, along with assonance, in rap music.  This can be used to avoid rhyming clichés (e.g. rhyming "knowledge" with "college") or obvious rhymes, and gives the writer greater freedom and flexibility in forming lines of verse.  Additionally, some words have no perfect rhyme in English, necessitating the use of slant rhyme.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bookbuilder.cast.org/view_print.php?book=29669 |title=Exploring Modern Day Poetry (aka Hip-Hop) |accessdate=31 Mar 2014[/tpl]
In the following lines from the song "N.Y. State of Mind" by rapper Nas, the author uses half rhyme in a complex cross rhyme pattern:
 
 And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin’ us, we’re held like hostages
