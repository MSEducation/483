==Background==

The recording of the album began in Spring 2006. Drake Bell wrote all of the songs on the album, however, all the songs were, as with Telegraph, co-written along with either Michael Corcoran and/or C.J. Abraham. The album was produced by Backhouse Mike (Michael Corcoran) and co-produced by Drake and C.J. Abraham, and was mixed by Rob Jacobs and C.J. Abraham. The album cover was photographed by Nabil Elderkin and the art direction of the cover and backcover was by John Pina.
The album had two singles, "I Know" and "Makes Me Happy", with Makes Me Happy being the most successful. I Know also had a music video that aired on MTV two days after the album release. This album was followed by Bell's EP, A Reminder.
The last four songs on the album form "a narrative about the ups and downs in three different relationships", that go together, without breaks, a credited homage to the second side of The Beatlesâ€™ Abbey Road.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/11/12/actor_drake_bell_crosses_over_will_relea_5 | title=Actor Drake Bell To Release Major Label Debut, "It's Only Time," Dec. 5 | accessdate=2006-12-05 [/tpl]
Two versions of the album were released, a standard version, and a deluxe version that came with a bonus DVD and stickers.

In the Drake & Josh TV special Really Big Shrimp, Bell's character in the show gets a record deal and repeatedly plays the song "Makes Me Happy" throughout the movie. The version played in the movie is different than the version that appears on It's Only Time and uses the lyrics from the version of "Makes Me Happy" that can be heard in an episode of Zoey 101.
