Iota (uppercase Ι, lowercase ι; [tpl]Lang-el|Ιώτα[/tpl]) is the ninth letter of the Greek alphabet. Letters that arose from this letter include the Roman I and J and the Cyrillic І (І, і), Yi (Ї, ї), Je (Ј, ј), and iotified letters (e.g. Yu (Ю, ю)).
In the system of Greek numerals iota has a value of 10.http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Greek_numbers.html 
Iota represents the sound [tpl]IPA-el|i|[/tpl]. In ancient Greek it occurred in both long [tpl]IPA|iː[/tpl] and short [tpl]IPA|i[/tpl] versions, but this distinction was lost in Koine Greek.
Iota participated as the second element in falling diphthongs, with both long and short vowels as the first element. Where the first element was long, the iota was lost in pronunciation at an early date, and was written in polytonic orthography as iota subscript, in other words as a very small ι under the main vowel, for instance [tpl]Unicode|ᾼ ᾳ ῌ ῃ ῼ ῳ[/tpl]. The former diphthongs became digraphs for simple vowels in Koine Greek.see Koine Greek phonology
The word is used in a common English phrase, 'not one iota', meaning 'not the slightest amount', in reference to a phrase in the New Testament: "until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law" ([tpl]bibleverse||Mt|5:18|ESV[/tpl]).[tpl]cite book|last1=Ammer|first1=Christine|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms|page=445|year=1997[/tpl]
The word 'jot' (or iot) derives from iota.http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jot
The German, Portuguese and Spanish name for the letter J (Jot / jota) is derived from iota.
