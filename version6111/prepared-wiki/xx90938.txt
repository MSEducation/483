The Caribbean hermit crab, Coenobita clypeatus,  also known as the soldier crab, the West Atlantic crab, the tree crab, and the purple pincher (due to the distinctive purple claw), is a species of land hermit crab native to the west Atlantic, Bahamas, Belize, southern Florida,[tpl]cite web |accessdate=July 14, 2009 |title=Common Coastal Flora and Fauna of Vieques |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |url=http://mapping2.orr.noaa.gov/portal/vieques/pdfs/VCHTbook.pdf[/tpl] Venezuela, the Virgin Islands, and the West Indies.[tpl]cite book |author=Audrey Pavia |year=2006 |edition=2nd |title=Hermit Crab |series=Volume 51 of Your Happy Healthy Pet |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-79379-3 |chapter=What is a hermit crab? |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FlYGxERCosEC&pg=PA18 |pages=13–22[/tpl] Adults burrow and hide under the roots of large trees, and can be found a considerable distance inland.
Caribbean hermit crabs are both herbivorous and scavengers. In the wild, C. clypeatus feeds on animal and plant remains, overripe fruit, and feces of other animals, including the Mona ground iguana, Cyclura stejnegeri. The West Indian top snail (Cittarium pica) shell is often used for its home, and the hermit crab can use its larger claw to cover the aperture of the shell for protection against predators. Typically, the Caribbean hermit crab's left claw is larger in size than its right claw and is purple in color. Female land hermit crabs release fertilized eggs into the ocean. The spawning (called "washing" in the English-speaking Caribbean) occurs on certain nights, usually around August.[tpl]cite journal|author=Ángel M. Nieves-Rivera & Ernest H.
