==Investigation==

Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) opened an investigation into the accident.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mak.ru/russian/investigations/2011/tu-154b_ra-85588.html |title=Ту-154Б RA-85588 1 January 2011 |publisher=Межгосударственный авиационный комитет |language=Russian |accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl] A separate criminal investigation was opened to investigate allegations of breaching transport and fire safety rules. The Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder were recovered from the wreckage of the aircraft. Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations stated that the initial investigations pointed towards an electrical short circuit being the cause of the fire, which started in the central area of the fuselage, ahead of the rear-mounted engines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/01/02/351418/tu-154-fire-sparked-by-electrical-short-circuit-ministry.html |title=Tu-154 fire sparked by electrical short-circuit: ministry |first=David |last=Kaminski-Morrow |publisher=Flight International |accessdate=2 January 2011[/tpl] The fire started between frames 65 and 68. In a statement issued on 4 January, the MAK ruled out the engines or auxiliary power unit as the cause of the fire.
On 28 September 2011 the MAK released their final report in Russian stating that the probable cause of the accident was "The outbreak of a fire in the right generator panel located between frames 62 and 64 in the cabin The cause of the fire was an electrical arc produced by electrical currents exceeding 10 to 20 times the nominal loads when two generators not synchronised with each other were brought online but got connected together instead of being connected to parallel busses."
