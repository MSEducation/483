[[Hurricane Winifred (1992)]]

CATEGORIES: 1992 Pacific hurricane season, Category 3 Pacific hurricanes, Pacific hurricanes in Mexico

Hurricane Winifred was the last tropical cyclone to make landfall in the busy 1992 Pacific hurricane season. Impacting western Mexico, especially Colima and Michoacán, Hurricane Winifred brought heavy rain and destruction to the area. Rains flooded farms and roads, and caused more than $5 million (1992 USD, $[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|5000000|1992[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]#time:Y[/tpl] USD) in damage and a total of three people were killed.
The last major hurricane of its season, Winifred existed in October 1992. It formed southeast of Acapulco on October 6 as the twenty-fourth east Pacific tropical cyclone of its season, and recurved as it strengthened. It peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. It made landfall southeast of Manzanillo, Colima and dissipated inland.

==Meteorological history==

On October 1, a disorganized area of thunderstorms existed south of Panama. It gradually headed west-northwestward, slowly organized, and developed deep and concentrated convection. The disturbed area had become organized enough to be considered a tropical depression. Numbered Twenty-Four-E, the cyclone was located about 460 mi (740 km) south-southeast of Acapulco. It moved towards the west-northwest at a speed of about 12 mph (19 km/h), and by the time it was located about [tpl]convert|550|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] south of Zihuatanejo, it had intensified into Tropical Storm Winifred.[tpl]cite web|publisher=National Hurricane Center|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Winifred |format=GIF |accessdate=2011-01-02|page=1 |url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1992-prelim/winifred/prelim01.gif[/tpl]
Winifred steadily became more organized, and late on October 7, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) was anticipating Winifred to reach hurricane intensity within the next 36 hours.[tpl]cite web|publisher=National Hurricane Center|last=Lixon Avila|title=Tropical Storm Winifred Discussion 4|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1992/winifred/tropdisc/nep2492.004|accessdate=2011-03-06|date=October 7, 1992[/tpl] A large cyclone, Winifred continued to intensify. Its forward speed decreased as it started to turn to the northwest.[tpl]cite web|last=Richard Pasch|title=Tropical Storm Winifred Discussion 5|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1992/winifred/tropdisc/nep2492.005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-03-26|date=October 8, 1992[/tpl] By October 8, Winifred become a hurricane while located approximately [tpl]convert|340|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] south-southeast of Manzanillo. A small eye became evident on satellite imagery, and thus the winds increased to 85 mph (145 km/h).[tpl]cite web|last=Miles Lawrence|title=Hurricane Winifred Discussion 8|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1992/winifred/tropdisc/nep2492.008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=March 26, 2011|date=October 8, 1992[/tpl]
Winifred then intensified into a moderate Category 2 hurricane on October 9. Although the eye briefly disappeared, slight intensification was anticipated.[tpl]cite web|last=Max Mayfield|title=Hurricane Winifred Discussion 10|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1992/winifred/tropdisc/nep2492.010|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2011-03-26|date=October 8, 1992[/tpl] The hurricane was curved north by an upper-level trough. Winifred peaked in intensity as a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Scale). At this time, Winifred, had central pressure of [tpl]convert|960|mb|inHg|lk=on|abbr=on[/tpl] and winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). This made Winifred the final hurricane– major or otherwise– of the 1992 Pacific hurricane season.[tpl]EPAC hurricane best track[/tpl] However, it was operationally believed to have peaked as a Category 2 hurricane; the NHC did not issue any advisories with winds any higher than 110 mph (175 km/h).
Hurricane Winifred re-curved to the north-northeast, increased in forward speed, and slightly weakened as it approached land. On October 9, it made landfall about  east-southeast of Manzanillo. At the time it was a weak Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) and a central pressure of [tpl]convert|975|mb|inHg|abbr=on[/tpl]. Hurricane Winifred quickly weakened after landfall, and weakened to a tropical storm less than three hours later, which was early on October 10. Later on October 10, Winifred weakened to a tropical depression, before dissipating over the mountains of central Mexico.

==Preparations and impact==

Five thousand people were evacuated to emergency shelters as Winifred neared.[tpl]cite news|author=Reuters |date=October 10, 1992 |page=A2 |title=Hurricane hits resort |work=Calgary Herald[/tpl] With the approach of the hurricane, watches and warnings were issued. On October 9 a tropical storm warning was issued from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes. At the same time, a hurricane watch went into effect in the same area.
The watch was later replaced with a hurricane warning 12 hours later. On October 10, all watches and warnings were dropped.[tpl]cite web|publisher=National Hurricane Center |title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Winifred |format=GIF |accessdate=2011-01-02 |page=4 |url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1992-prelim/winifred/prelim04.gif[/tpl]
Starting on October 8, Hurricane Winifred caused rainfall over an extensive area of Mexico. The highest point maximum reported was of [tpl]convert|16.7|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] at Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán, a point to the right of its track.[tpl]cite web|title=Hurricane Winifred – October 3–11, 1992|first=David M |last=Roth |authorlink=David M. Roth |publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center |url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/winifred1992.html |accessdate=2011-01-02[/tpl] That rain caused flooding, which was blamed for three deaths.[tpl]cite web|publisher=National Hurricane Center |title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Winifred |format=GIF |accessdate=2011-01-02 |page=2 |url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1992-prelim/winifred/prelim02.gif[/tpl]
Damage was heaviest in the states of Colima and Michoacán. In areas of the former, utilities were knocked out. Waves flooded portions of Highway 200 between Zihuatenajo, Ixtapa, and Lázaro Cárdenas. Other roads were also flooded. Waves [tpl]convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] forced the closure of Playa de Oro International Airport and port facilities in Manzanillo. Throughout the affected area, trees were blown down on cars, roughly 1,500 houses were damaged, as were hotels and restaurants. About [tpl]convert|84000|ha|acre|abbr=on[/tpl] of farmland were damaged, especially those of plantains and corn. Carlos de la Madrid Virgen, the Governor of Colima, estimated that the total damage in his state was 16000 pesos (1992 MXP) or $5 million (1992 USD, $[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|5000000|1992[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]#time:Y[/tpl] USD). Elsewhere, Winifred forced a temporary closure of the port of Acapulco.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YFFLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dSMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6592,2306040&dq=hurricane-winifred&hl=en |publisher=Google News Archive |work=Press-Courier |date=October 10, 1992 |accessdate=2011-03-17 |title=Hurrican (sic) forced ports to close |author=Associated Press[/tpl]
