In the 1964 election, he endorsed Lyndon Baines Johnson, who had masterminded the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through Congress over the vociferous opposition of Southern Democrats. That year, Heston publicly opposed California Proposition 14 that rolled back the state's fair housing law, the  Rumford Fair Housing Act.
In his 1995 autobiography In the Arena, written after his transformation into a conservative Republican, Heston claimed that on a drive back from the set of The War Lord, he saw Barry Goldwater for President billboard with his campaign slogan "In Your Heart You Know He's Right" and thought to himself, "Son of a bitch, he is right."[tpl]cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven J.|title=Hollywood Left and Right:How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|location=New York|isbn=978-0195181722|page=288[/tpl]  However, Heston's memory may have been unreliable. Aside from the Southern Democrats who opposed the Civil Rights Act on the grounds of defending segregation, Goldwater was the most prominent opponent of the bill, which he opposed on libertarian principles, even though he was the first Phoenix Arizona businessman to hire blacks as sales clerks breaking the city's color barrier regarding hiring practices. Nationally syndicated political columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak reported in September 1964 that a heavy turnout of supporters of Prop 14, i.e., opponents of the fair housing law, could bolster support for conservative candidates like actor George Murphy in his bid for Pierre Salinger's Senate seat and help Goldwater win California.[tpl]cite news|last=Evans|first=Rowland|title=California Democrats Open Drive in Fair Housing Vote|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19640920&id=HpNSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WQEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3440,580208|accessdate=August 6, 2013|newspaper=Toledo Blade|date=September 20, 1964[/tpl]  Thus, Heston's speaking out against Prop 14 would have been seen by contemporaries as hurting Goldwater.
Heston also later claimed that his "support" for Goldwater was the event that helped turn him against gun control laws.[tpl]cite book|last=Denning|first=Brandon P.|title=Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=978-0313386701[/tpl]  Yet, following the assassination of Senator Robert F.
