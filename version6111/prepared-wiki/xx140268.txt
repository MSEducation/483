This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get is a 1984 album by Public Image Ltd. It is the band's fourth official studio album and includes the single "Bad Life", and a re-recorded version of a "This Is Not a Love Song", which had been a No. 5 UK and international hit when released as a single in 1983.
An early version of the album was released in 1983 by founding PiL guitarist Keith Levene as Commercial Zone. The album was then re-recorded after Levene's departure from the band, with no contributions from either Levene or bassist Pete Jones (who contributed to several tracks on Commercial Zone).
The song "The Order of Death" appears in the 1990 science fiction film, Hardware. It was also featured in the Miami Vice episode, "Little Miss Dangerous". "This is Not a Love Song" appears in the film Waltz With Bashir.
The line "This is what you want... This is what you get" appears in both "Bad Life" and "The Order of Death".

==Links with the film Copkiller==

PiL was supposed to score the soundtrack for the 1983 suspense film Copkiller, starring Harvey Keitel and John Lydon, who worked on the material with his band mates Keith Levene and Martin Atkins (over the phone, by long distance).Fodderstompf, Fodderstompf: PiL Fansite Archive – Order Of Death
In early November 1982 PiL announced the imminent release of a new single, Blue Water, and a six-track mini album, You Are Now Entering a Commercial Zone, on their new label, which was supposed to release the unused music for Copkiller. This did not happen, with the band instead continuing to record a full-length album at South Park Studios.
In mid-1983, in PiL's absence, Keith Levene took the unfinished album tapes and did his own mix. He then flew over to London and presented them to Richard Branson as the finished new PiL album for Virgin Records: Commercial Zone. For his part, John Lydon decided to completely abandon the tapes and re-record the whole album from scratch with session musicians. This new version of Commercial Zone became This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get in 1984.
"The Order of Death" is a reference to the film Copkiller, also known as The Order of Death. The line "This is what you want... This is what you get", which gives title to the album, appears in the film.
