A music video to accompany the release of "Dust Clears" was first released onto YouTube on 19 June 2013 at a total length of four minutes and fifty seconds. Talking about the video Clean Bandit said "We created and filmed the video ourselves completely and had an amazing time shooting it on a frozen lake in Sweden. Two of Jack's friends from film school who helped us make the Mozart's House video came to Sweden to help with this one too: Anna Patarakina and Daria Novitskaya. Big thank you to them and Nick Martin, the skater featured in the video." The video was filmed, directed and produced by Clean Bandit.Clean Bandit - Dust Clears. YouTube
