Chris Dickerson (born Henri Christophe Dickerson on August 25, 1939 in Montgomery, Alabama), is a former American bodybuilder.

==Early life==

Dickerson was born to Mahala Ashley Dickerson as the youngest of triplets.  He studied music and is an accomplished opera singer in addition to his career in athletics.

==Bodybuilding career==

One of the world's most titled bodybuilders, Dickerson's competitive career spanned thirty years; he was known for both his heavily muscled, symmetrical physique and for his skills on the posing dais.  
Dickerson first entered bodybuilding competition in 1965 by taking third place at that year's Mr. Long Beach competition.  
He trained for many of his most important competitions in the 1980s with former Mr. Universe Bill Pearl.  
He was the first African-American AAU Mr. America, the oldest winner of the IFBB Mr. Olympia contest at age 43, and one of only two bodybuilders (along with Dexter Jackson) to win titles in both the Mr. Olympia and Masters Olympia competitions.
Dickerson won the Mr. Olympia once (1982), a distinction he shares with Samir Bannout (1983) and Dexter Jackson (2008).
Dickerson retired in 1994 and was inducted into the IFBB Hall of Fame in 2000.
Today, Dickerson lives in Florida where he continues to train, conduct seminars, and correspond with current athletes.

==Modeling==

During the 1960s, Dickerson did much physique modeling. 
His 1970's nude work for photographer Jim French is today considered some of the best in an admittedly limited field.
Chris appeared in French's hardcover photo essay, Man (1972) and also posed for the photographer ten years later.
These photos ran in an issue of Olympus, published by Colt Studios.[tpl]cite news|title=Who is Chris Dickerson?|url=http://encycl.opentopia.com/term/Chris_Dickerson|accessdate=16 March 2013|newspaper=opentopia.com|date=16 March 2013[/tpl]
