CATEGORIES: Debuggers

The Remedy debugger was the first embedded system level debugger in the world.[tpl]citationneeded|date=September 2013[/tpl] It offered many features that users take for granted today in the days when having a source level debugger was a luxury. Some of these features include:
It started as an academic research project (originally called Melody for debugging the Harmony Operating System). The results were published in one of the early papers on debugging multiprocessor systems."Remedy, A Real-Time Multiprocessor System Level Debugger, IEEE Symposium on Real-Time Systems, December, 1987"
The current version of Unison Operating System continues to use both gdb and Remedy debugger.Host Development, Deeply Embedded Development and Multiprocessor ProductsAn Integrated Real-Time Multiprocessor Development Environment, Rowe P.K.
