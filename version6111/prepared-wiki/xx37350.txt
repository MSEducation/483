Jimmy Eat World is an American rock band from Mesa, Arizona, that formed in 1993. The band is composed of lead vocalist and guitarist Jim Adkins, guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton, bassist Rick Burch and drummer Zach Lind. As of June 2013, Jimmy Eat World has released eight studio albums, the last seven featuring the current lineup.
The four piece's commercial breakthrough came with the successful release of several singles from the album Bleed American (2001). Four singles from the album charted within the top twenty positions of the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart, with "The Middle" reaching the number one position. Jimmy Eat World's follow-up album Futures (2004) featured another Modern Rock Tracks number one song, "Pain". The RIAA certified Bleed American platinum and Futures gold, rewarding the two albums for selling over one and a half million records between them. The band's sixth album Chase This Light (2007) became the band's highest charting album, peaking at number five on the Billboard 200.

==History==

===Formation and name===

Jimmy Eat World formed in Mesa, Arizona in 1993. Guitarist Jim Adkins and drummer Zach Lind, who had been friends since preschool, joined with guitarist Tom Linton and bass player Mitch Porter to try their hand at music. The band originally formed with a punk rock sound and first released a demo tape in 1993, followed by their first EP in 1994, entitled One, Two, Three, Four. Their debut self-titled album (1994) was released with Linton singing most of the lead vocals on the album. Within the span of a couple of years, the band recorded and released three singles and a full-length on local label Wooden Blue Records.
Contrary to popular belief, the band name acronym (JEW) is not a reference to the band's religious beliefs, nor to member Jim Adkins. The band's name came from a crayon drawing made after an incident between Linton's younger brothers, Jim and Ed Linton, who fought frequently. Jim usually won, but Ed sought revenge by drawing a picture of Jim shoving the Earth into his mouth; the picture bore the caption "Jimmy eat world".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chrisblackburn.com/articles/0001.php |title=Interview: Tom Linton of Jimmy Eat World |publisher=ChrisBlackburn.com |last=Blackburn |first=Chris |date=April 1999 |accessdate=March 3, 2007 [/tpl] Linton: "Actually, it's a picture that my little brother drew ... probably five years ago. My brother Jim beat up my younger brother Ed, and Jim ran into his room and locked his door, and Ed drew this picture that said "Jimmy Eat World", and it was a picture of him eating the world."

===Static Prevails===

Eventually, spurred by bands such as Sunny Day Real Estate, the band began to experiment with slower tempos and more varied song structures. As they began writing songs and touring in the indie scene, the band encountered like-minded bands, such as Christie Front Drive, Sense Field, and Seven Storey Mountain, that were working on similar sounds.
The band began to attract increasing attention following the release of numerous recordings and concurrent touring.[tpl]cite web|title=Five Minutes with Fame: Jimmy Eat World|url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6406_jimmy-eat-world-interview-video/|work=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc|accessdate=20 August 2012|author=Rock Hall|date=2 September 2010[/tpl] In response to this self-generated exposure, Capitol Records offered the band a deal in mid-1995, following the interest of Loren Israel, the A&R Director of the label.[tpl]cite web|title=Loren Israel: Director of A&R Capitol Records|url=http://www.taxi.com/transmitter/0311/director-ar-capitol-records.html|work=Taxi Transmitter|publisher=Taxi|accessdate=20 August 2012|author=Doug Minnick|year=2012[/tpl] Just prior to signing with Capitol, bass player Mitch Porter parted ways with the band and was replaced by Linton's friend Rick Burch.
After a brief scouting for producers, the band joined up with Drive Like Jehu drummer Mark Trombino to record its major-label debut Static Prevails that featured their first singles "Call It In The Air" and "Rockstar".[tpl]cite web|title=Jimmy Eat World – Static Prevails|url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimmy-Eat-World-Static-Prevails/release/2449536|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=5 April 2013|year=2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Jimmy Eat World – Call It In The Air / Rockstar|url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimmy-Eat-World-Call-It-In-The-Air-Rockstar/release/3840073|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=5 April 2013|year=2013[/tpl] In the ensuing years, the band's agreement with Capitol permitted the release of singles on independent labels, including split 7-inch singles with Christie Front Drive (Wooden Blue Records, 1995),[tpl]cite web|title=Christie Front Drive / Jimmy Eat World – Split|url=http://www.discogs.com/Christie-Front-Drive-Jimmy-Eat-World-Split/release/2100214|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=5 April 2013|year=2013[/tpl] Jejune (Big Wheel Recreation, 1997),[tpl]cite web|title=Jejune [tpl]![/tpl] Jimmy Eat World – Jejune |url=http://www.discogs.com/Jejune-Jimmy-Eat-World-Jejune-Jimmy-Eat-World/master/216927|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=5 April 2013|year=2013[/tpl] Blueprint (Abridged Records, 1996),[tpl]cite web|title=Jimmy Eat World / Blueprint (4) – Jimmy Eat World / Blueprint|url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimmy-Eat-World-Blueprint-Jimmy-Eat-World-Blueprint/release/2098855|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=5 April 2013|year=2013[/tpl] Sense Field, and Mineral.[tpl]cite web|title=Mineral / Jimmy Eat World / Sense Field – Mineral / Jimmy Eat World / Sense Field|url=http://www.discogs.com/Mineral-Jimmy-Eat-World-Sense-Field-Mineral-Jimmy-Eat-World-Sense-Field/master/212454|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=5 April 2013|year=2013[/tpl]

===Clarity===

From late 1998 to early 1999, the band recorded their next album Clarity at two studios, Sound City Studios (Van Nuys, U.S.) and Clear Lake Audio (North Hollywood, U.S.). The tracks were mixed at One on One Studios (Los Angeles, U.S.) and Music Grinder Studios, and was mastered at Bernie Grundman Mastering (Hollywood, U.S.). Both the band and Trombino produced the album, with the latter also responsible for the album's mixing duties. Clarity marks the start of Adkins's primary role as lead vocalist and, instead, Linton's focus was guitar work.[tpl]cite web|title=Jimmy Eat World – Clarity|url=http://www.discogs.com/Jimmy-Eat-World-Clarity/release/2787431|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=5 April 2013|year=2013[/tpl] Clarity was also released on vinyl through the now-defunct American independent record label Big Wheel Recreation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/epm/13867 |title=Jimmy Eat World |last1=Larkin |first1=Colin |website=Oxford Music Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl]

===Bleed American===

The band decided to record its next album without the help of a label, supporting itself with touring and by compiling its previously released singles into Singles, which was released on indie label Big Wheel Recreation. The band also took on day jobs, saving as much as they could to spend on the sessions.Mehr, Bob. "In between tightly budgeted tours, Linton worked construction, while Adkins sold art supplies, Burch shipped auto parts and Lind shuttled customers at a car dealership." The band worked for a third time with Trombino, who agreed to defer payment until after the album's release in order to keep costs down.[tpl]cite web |last=Seigel |first=Steven |url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/gbase/Music/Content?oid=62054 |title=Jimmy Eat World |work=Tucson Weekly |date=October 21, 2004 [/tpl] Some of the drum tracks were recorded at Cherokee, and then the band moved to Doug Messenger's harddrive analog and digital in North Hollywood, where five weeks of tracking completed the recording phase. Trombino then mixed the record at Extasy in Hollywood.
The finished album was titled Bleed American. Joining with Gersh's new management company, GAS Entertainment, the band scouted for a new label. The result was a short bidding war, with interest coming from several major labels, including Capitol Records.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] The band eventually signed with DreamWorks. The completed album was released in July 2001, which included a vinyl edition through the now-defunct Grand Royal label, founded by the band the Beastie Boys in 1993.[tpl]cite news|title=For a Record Label Founded by the Beastie Boys, the End Is Less Than Grand|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/19/business/for-a-record-label-founded-by-the-beastie-boys-the-end-is-less-than-grand.html|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 January 2004|author=Bill Werde[/tpl] The title track (titled "Salt Sweat Sugar" in the UK) was the lead single. (Following the September 11 attacks, the band decided to re-issue the album as Jimmy Eat World out of concern that the title Bleed American might be misinterpreted, possibly as a threatening "bleed, American".Hancock, Todd.  "Jimmy Eat World's Jim and Tom vs Todd Hancock".  CFOX.  October 30, 2007. Adkins: "It was something that we decided around September 14 that we wanted to do. ...  We wanted people to listen to the record with as unbiased a viewpoint as they can bring into it so they could make the songs what they will for themselves and we just felt like that maybe the album title would get in the way of that.")
The album's second single, "The Middle" became the band's biggest single to date, reaching number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The video for the song received significant airplay on MTV, including on Total Request Live. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA.[tpl]cite web |url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Jimmy%20Eat%20World%22 |title=RIAA Gold and Platinum discs for Jimmy Eat World [/tpl]
In 2008, the album was re-released as a deluxe edition and renamed to its original title, Bleed American. This edition contains a total of 32 tracks — the original 11 as well as 21 bonus tracks, which are live recordings, demos and B-sides.

===Futures===

After lengthy touring in support of Bleed American, the band regrouped to work on the follow-up in early 2004. Once again, the band joined up with Trombino, but the collaboration was short-lived. As the sessions began, the band decided that they did not have enough material for a cohesive album. The band's desire to spend more time writing songs conflicted with Trombino's availability, as he already had other projects on his schedule.[tpl]cite web |last=Henderson |first=Steve |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=258417 |title=Jimmy Eat World — 07.27.07 |work=Absolute Punk |date=August 10, 2007 [/tpl]
Instead, the band brought in producer Gil Norton, well known for his work with the Pixies and the Foo Fighters. Lind explained in 2007, "After we left the studio with Trombino, we came up with 'Polaris', 'Work', 'Pain', and '23' – the songs that really gave Futures its heartbeat." Futures was released in October 2004, with "Pain" serving as the lead single. (By this time, DreamWorks had been acquired by Interscope Records.)
Subsequent months saw the release of "Work" and the title track as singles. Having already toured the U.S. alone and with Taking Back Sunday, the band signed on to tour in 2005 with Green Day. In September 2005, the band released the Stay on My Side Tonight EP, which contained reworked versions of demos recorded with producer Mark Trombino that were not used for the album. The album was eventually awarded Gold status in the US by the RIAA.

===Chase This Light===

After its tour, Jimmy Eat World headed home to Tempe and started working on material for a sixth album. The band decided to self-produce the album, enlisting Chris Testa (Dixie Chicks) and John Fields (Switchfoot, Mandy Moore) as co-producers and Butch Vig (Nirvana, Garbage, The Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day) as executive producer. As Burch explained to the St. Petersburg Times, "Vig's role wasn't in the studio everyday. We would send Butch samples of what we were doing every couple of days."[tpl]cite web |last=Giambalvo |first=Carole |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/11/30/Music/Jimmy_Eat_World_not_s.shtml |title=Music: Jimmy Eat World |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=November 30, 2007 [/tpl] Chase This Light was released on October 16, 2007, with "Big Casino" as the lead single. "Always Be" was the most recent single off the album, released in December 2007.
