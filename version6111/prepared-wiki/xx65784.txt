The Morgenthau Plan, first proposed by United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. in a memorandum entitled Suggested Post-Surrender Program for Germany, advocated that the Allied occupation of Germany following World War II include measures to eliminate Germany's ability to wage war by eliminating its armament industry, and the removal or destruction of other key industries basic to military strength. This included the removal or destruction of all industrial plants and equipment in the Ruhr area.[tpl]Cite web | last    =Morgenthau | first   =Henry | author-link  = Henry Morgenthau, Jr. | publication-date = 27 May 2004 | year = 1944 | title= Suggested Post-Surrender Program for Germany original memorandum from 1944, signed by Morgenthau (text and facsimile) | work = Box 31, Folder Germany: Jan.-Sept. 1944 (i297) | publisher = Franklin D.

The contemporary historical assessment is that the Morgenthau Plan was of no significance for later occupation and policy in Germany, but that Nazi propaganda on the subject had a lasting effect and that it is still used for propaganda purposes by extreme right-wing organizations.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title=Morgenthau-Plan | encyclopedia=Handbuch des Antisemitismus: Judenfeindschaft in Geschichte und Gegenwart | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | accessdate=1 March 2014 | author=Benz, Wolfgang | editor=Saur, K.

==Overview==

The original proposal outlined three steps:
At the Second Quebec Conference on September 16, 1944, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Henry Morgenthau, Jr. persuaded the initially very reluctant British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to agree to the plan, likely using a $6 billion Lend Lease agreement to do so.[tpl]Citation | first = John L | last = Chase | title = The Development of the Morgenthau Plan Through the Quebec Conference | journal = The Journal of Politics | volume = 16 | number = 2 | date = May 1954| pages = 324–59[/tpl] Churchill chose however to narrow the scope of Morgenthau's proposal by drafting a new version of the memorandum, which ended up being the version signed by the two statesmen.
The plan's program, the memorandum concluded, "is looking forward to converting Germany into a country primarily agricultural and pastoral in its character."[tpl]Citation | last = Dallek | first = Robert | title = Franklin D.

News of the existence of the plan was leaked to the press.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,933072-1,00.html | work=Time | title=The Policy of Hate | date=October 2, 1944 | accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl] President Roosevelt's response to press inquiries was to deny the press reports.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,803331,00.html | work=Time | title=The Battle for Peace Terms | date=October 9, 1944 | accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl]
In wartime Germany, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels was able to use the plan to bolster the German resistance on the Western front.[tpl]Sfn | Dietrich | 2002 | p = 70[/tpl]
In occupied Germany, the thinking behind the Morgenthau plan was reflected in the U.S. occupation directive JCS 1067[tpl]Sfn | Beschloss | p = 233[/tpl][tpl]Sfn | Gareau | 1961 | p = 520[/tpl] and in the Allied Industrial plans for Germany aimed at "industrial disarmament",[tpl]Sfn | Gareau | 1961 | p = 520[/tpl] designed to reduce German economic might and to destroy Germany's capability to wage war by complete or partial deindustrialization and restrictions imposed on utilization of remaining production capacity.  By 1950, after the virtual completion of the by then much watered-down "level of industry" plans, equipment had been removed from 706 manufacturing plants in the west and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6,700,000 tons.[tpl]Sfn | Gareau | 1961 | pp = 517–34[/tpl]
Partly for the sake of lowering German standards, restrictions were also enacted on food relief imports.
According to some historians the U.S. government formally abandoned the Morgenthau plan as promoted occupation-policy in September 1946 with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes' speech Restatement of Policy on Germany.GIMBEL, John "On the Implementation of the Potsdam Agreement: An Essay on U.S. Postwar German Policy" Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 87, No. 2. (Jun., 1972), pp. 242-269.
Unhappy with the Morgenthau-plan consequences, former U.S. President Herbert Hoover remarked in a report dated 18 March 1947:
It is argued that it was Hoover's March 1947 statements in his report that led to the end of the Morgenthau plan and to a change in U.S. policy.[tpl]Failed verification|date=June 2013[/tpl]
In July 1947 with the advent of the initial planning for the Marshall Plan designed to help the now deteriorating European economy recover, the restrictions placed on annual German steel production were lessened. Permitted steel production quotas were raised from 25% of pre-war capacity to 50% of pre-war capacity.Pas de Pagaille! Time Magazine, Jul. 28, 1947. The U.S. occupation directive JCS 1067, whose economic section had prohibited "steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany or designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy", was replaced by the new U.S. occupation directive JCS 1779 which instead stated that "an orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany."
In early 1947 four million German soldiers were still being used as forced labour in the UK, France, and the Soviet Union.[tpl]Sfn | Dietrich 2002 | p = 123[/tpl][tpl]Citation | first= Eugene | last = Davidson | title = The Death and Life of Germany | page = 166[/tpl][tpl]Citation | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=4&documentid=24&documentdate=1947-02-28&studycollectionid=mp&nav=OK | first = Herbert | last = Hoover | format = press release | title = The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria, Report No. 1: German Agriculture and Food Requirements | date = February 28, 1947 | page = 2[/tpl]
In 1951 West Germany agreed to join the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) the following year. This meant that some of the economic restrictions on production capacity and on actual production that were imposed by the International Authority for the Ruhr were lifted, and that its role was taken over by the ECSC.[tpl]Citation | url = http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History-idx?type=article&did=HISTORY.0057.0400.0023&isize=M | format = information bulletin | place = Frankfurt, DE | publisher = Office of the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany Office of Public Affairs, Public Relations Division, APO 757, U.S. Army |date=January 1952 | title = Plans for terminating international authority for the Ruhr | pages = 61–62 | url = http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/History.omg1952Jan[/tpl]
Although the dismantling of West German industry ended in 1951, "industrial disarmament" lingered in restrictions on actual German steel production, and production capacity, as well as on restrictions on key industries. All remaining restrictions were rescinded on May 5, 1955. According to Frederick Gareau, noting that although U.S. policy had changed well before that, "the last act of the Morgenthau drama occurred on that date 5, 1955 or when the Saar was returned to Germany 1, 1957."[tpl]Sfn | Gareau | 1961 | p = 520[/tpl]
Vladimir Petrov concludes that the Allies "delayed by several years the economic reconstruction of the wartorn continent, a reconstruction which subsequently cost the United States billions of dollars."[tpl]Sfn | Petrov | 1967 | p = 263[/tpl]

==Morgenthau's memorandum==

The original memorandum, written sometime between January and early September 1944, signed by Morgenthau, and headed "Suggested Post-Surrender Program for Germany" is preserved at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum. The text, and a facsimile image, can be viewed online.The original memorandum from 1944, signed by Morgenthau
The main provisions can be summarized as follows:

==The Second Quebec Conference (September 1944)==

At the Second Quebec Conference, a high-level military conference held in Quebec City, September 12–16, 1944, the British and United States governments, represented by Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, respectively, reached agreement on a number of matters, including a plan for Germany, based on Morgenthau's original proposal. The memorandum drafted by Churchill provided for "eliminating the warmaking industries in the Ruhr and the Saar... looking forward to converting Germany into a country primarily agricultural and pastoral in its character." However, it no longer included a plan to partition the country into several independent states.United States Government Printing Office, Report on the Morgenthau Diaries prepared by the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee of the Judiciary appointed to investigate the Administration of the McCarran Internal Security Act and other Internal Security Laws, (Washington, 1967) volume 1, pp. 620–21
This memorandum, together with the later effected "industrial disarmament" plans in occupied Germany, is generally known as the real Morgenthau plan.[tpl]Sfn | Gareau | 1961 | p = 517[/tpl]
(See United States Department of State Foreign relations of the United States, Conference at Quebec, 1944 pp. 466–67 for the full text of the signed memoranda.)

==Roosevelt's support for the plan==

Secretary of the Treasury Henry J. Morgenthau Jr. convinced Roosevelt to write to Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson saying that a US occupation policy which anticipated that "Germany is to be restored just as much as the Netherlands or Belgium" was excessively lenient.  A better policy would have the Germans "fed three times a day with soup from Army soup kitchens" so "they will remember that experience the rest of their lives."[tpl]Sfn | Hull | 1948 | pp = 1602–3[/tpl]  Morgenthau was the only Cabinet member invited to participate in the Quebec Conference during which the Plan was agreed to.
Roosevelt's motivations for agreeing to Morgenthau's proposal may be attributed to his desire to be on good terms with Joseph Stalin and to a personal conviction that Germany must be treated harshly. In an August 26, 1944 letter to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, Roosevelt wrote that "There are two schools of thought, those who would be altruistic in regard to the Germans, hoping by loving kindness to make them Christians again — and those who would adopt a much 'tougher' attitude. Most decidedly I belong to the latter school, for though I am not bloodthirsty, I want the Germans to know that this time at least they have definitely lost the war."The Roosevelt Letters, volume III: 1928–1945, London, 1952.
Secretary of State Hull was outraged by Morgenthau's "inconceivable intrusion" into foreign policy. Hull told Roosevelt that the plan would inspire last-ditch resistance and cost thousands of American lives. Hull was so upset over the plan that it prompted his resignation from the administration.[tpl]Citation | last = Fleming | first = Thomas | title = The New Dealers' War: FDR And The War Within World War II | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2001 | page = 432[/tpl]  This assertion of the reason for Hull's resignation is highly debatable; Hull's letter of resignation,[tpl]Citation | title = Presidency | publisher = UCSB | url = http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16479[/tpl] makes clear that ill health was the cause, and that Hull wanted to continue in office: "It is with inexpressible disappointment that I find it necessary, for considerations of health, to retire from public service.  ...It is a supreme tragedy to me personally that I am unable to continue making my full contribution to such great international undertakings as the creation of the postwar peace organization, the solution of the many other problems involved in the promotion of international cooperation, and the final development of a full and complete structure of a world order under law.  When I recover my strength, I shall individually be always at your service in every possible way."

==Churchill's support for the plan==

Churchill was not inclined to support the proposal, saying "England would be chained to a dead body."  Roosevelt reminded Churchill of Stalin's comments at the Tehran Conference, and asked "Are you going to let Germany produce modern metal furniture?  The manufacture of metal furniture can be quickly turned in the manufacture of armament."Memorandum by Harry Dexter White for the Secretary of the Treasury, September 25, 1944, Memorandum by the Deputy Directory of the Office of European Affairs for the Secretary of State, September 20, 1944. The meeting broke up on Churchill's disagreement but Roosevelt suggested that Morgenthau and White continue to discuss with Lord Cherwell, Churchill's personal assistant.
Lord Cherwell has been described as having "an almost pathological hatred for Nazi Germany, and an almost medieval desire for revenge was a part of his character".John W. Wheeler-Bennett and Anthony Nicholls, "The Semblance of Peace" (London: 1972), p. 179.  Morgenthau is quoted as saying to his staff that "I can't overemphasize how helpful Lord Cherwell was because he could advise how to handle Churchill".[tpl]Sfn | Blum | 1967 | p = 373[/tpl] In any case, Cherwell was able to persuade Churchill to change his mind. Churchill later said that "At first I was violently opposed to the idea.  But the President and Mr. Morgenthau — from whom we had much to ask — were so insistent that in the end we agreed to consider it".Churchill, "The Tide of Victory" (London: 1954), pp. 138–39.
Some have read into the clause "from whom we had much to ask" that Churchill was bought off, and note a September 15 memo from Roosevelt to Hull stating that "Morgenthau has presented at Quebec, in conjunction with his plan for Germany, a proposal of credits to Britain totalling six and half billion dollars."  Hull's comment on this was that "this might suggest to some the quid pro quo with which the Secretary of the Treasury was able to get Mr. Churchill's adherence to his cataclysmic plan for Germany".[tpl]Sfn | Hull | 1948 | pages = 1613–4[/tpl]
Harry Dexter White, regarded by many as the principal author of the plan, was after his death exposed as having passed information on to the Soviets, who were U.S. allies at the time.
At Quebec White made sure that Lord Cherwell understood that economic aid to Britain was dependent on British approval of the plan. During the signing of the plan, which coincided with the signing of a loan agreement, President Roosevelt proposed that they sign the plan first. This prompted Churchill to exclaim: "What do you want me to do? Get on my hind legs and beg like Fala?"Investigations: One Man's Greed, Time Magazine, November 23, 1953

==Rejection of the plan==

Anthony Eden expressed his strong opposition to the plan and, with the support of some others, was able to get the Morgenthau Plan set aside in Britain.  In the U.S., Hull argued that nothing would be left to Germany but land, and only 60% of the Germans could live off the land, meaning 40% of the population would die.[tpl]Sfn | Hull | 1948 | p = 1617[/tpl]  Stimson expressed his opposition even more forcefully to Roosevelt.  According to Stimson, the President said that he just wanted to help Britain get a share of the Ruhr and denied that he intended to fully deindustrialize Germany. Stimson replied, "Mr. President, I don't like you to dissemble to me" and read back to Roosevelt what he had signed. Struck by this, Roosevelt said he had "no idea how he could have initialed this".Elting E. Morrison quoting Stimson's October 3, 1944 diary, "Turmoil and Tradition: A Study of the Life and Times of Henry L. Stimson" (Boston, 1960) p. 609. The theory that Roosevelt was not truly rejecting the plan, just postponing the decision until a more propitious time is supported by Eleanor Roosevelt, who states that she never heard him disagree with the basics of the plan, and who believed that "the repercussions brought about by the press stories made him feel that it was wise to abandon any final solution at that time."[tpl]Sfn | Gareau | 1961 | p = 530[/tpl]
On 10 May 1945 President Truman approved JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff policy) 1067 which directed the U.S. forces of occupation in Germany to "...take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany steps designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy". [tpl]Citation needed span|text=The net effect was that Germany wasn't allowed to realistically produce goods for export in order to purchase food; millions of Germans were supplied only meager starvation rations, with 1947 being the worst year. It took two years (1945 to 1947) of death and disease, and fears that starving Germans might "go Communist" before U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes made his Stuttgart speech.  Byrnes had some questionable history: he agreed at Potsdam in July 1945 to "temporarily assign" an area of southern Silesia to "Polish Administration" which was more than the Poles and Soviets had expected to be agreed to.  The British were not happy with Mr. Byrnes's maneuver.|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Dismantling of (West) German industry ended in 1951, but "industrial disarmament" lingered in restrictions on actual German steel production, and production capacity, as well as on restriction on key industries. All remaining restrictions were rescinded on May 5, 1955. "The last act of the Morgenthau drama occurred on that date or when the Saar was returned to Germany."[tpl]Sfn | Gareau | 1961 | p = 520[/tpl]

==Wartime consequences==

Drew Pearson publicized the plan on September 21, although Pearson himself was sympathetic to it. More critical stories in the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal quickly followed. Joseph Goebbels used the Morgenthau Plan in his propaganda. Goebbels said that "The Jew Morgenthau" wanted to make Germany into a giant potato patch. The headline of the Völkischer Beobachter stated, “ROOSEVELT AND CHURCHILL AGREE TO JEWISH MURDER PLAN!”[tpl]Sfn | Beschloss | p = 144[/tpl]
The Washington Post urged a stop to helping Dr. Goebbels: if the Germans suspect that nothing but complete destruction lies ahead, then they will fight on.[tpl]Sfn | Beschloss | pp = 144–45[/tpl] The Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey complained in his campaign that the Germans had been terrified by the plan into fanatical resistance, "Now they are fighting with the frenzy of despair."[tpl]Sfn | Beschloss | p = 160[/tpl]
General George Marshall complained to Morgenthau that German resistance had strengthened.Report on the Morgenthau Diaries, p. 41ff Hoping to get Morgenthau to relent on his plan for Germany, President Roosevelt's son-in-law Lt. Colonel John Boettiger who worked in the War Department explained to Morgenthau how the American troops who had had to fight for five weeks against fierce German resistance to capture the city of Aachen had complained to him that the Morgenthau Plan was "worth thirty divisions to the Germans." Morgenthau refused to relent.[tpl]Sfn | Beschloss | pp = 172–73[/tpl]
On December 11, OSS operative William Donovan sent Roosevelt a telegraph message from Bern, warning him of the consequences that the knowledge of the Morgenthau plan had had on German resistance; by showing them that the enemy planned the enslavement of Germany it had welded together ordinary Germans and the regime; the Germans continue to fight because they are convinced that defeat will bring nothing but oppression and exploitation.[tpl]Sfn | Beschloss | p = 171[/tpl]  The message was a translation of a recent article in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung.
[tpl]quote |So far, the Allies have not offered the opposition any serious encouragement.  On the contrary, they have again and again welded together the people and the Nazis by statements published, either out of indifference or with a purpose. To take a recent example, the Morgenthau plan gave Dr. Goebbels the best possible chance.  He was able to prove to his countrymen, in black and white, that the enemy planned the enslavement of Germany.  The conviction that Germany had nothing to expect from defeat but oppression and exploitation still prevails, and that accounts for the fact that the Germans continue to fight.  It is not a question of a regime, but of the homeland itself, and to save that, every German is bound to obey the call, whether he be Nazi or member of the opposition.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box32/t298m01.html | publisher = Marist | title = FDR library[/tpl][/tpl]

==Influence on policy==

Following the negative public reaction to the publishing of the Morgenthau plan President Roosevelt disowned it, saying "About this pastoral, agricultural Germany, that is just nonsense. I have not approved anything like that. I am sure I have not. . . . I have no recollection of this at all."[tpl]Sfn | Beschloss | p = 149[/tpl] The president died before the end of the war, and the plan never took effect.
In January 1946 the Allied Control Council set the foundation of the future German economy by putting a cap on German steel production, the maximum allowed was set at about 25% of the prewar production level."Cornerstone of Steel", Time Magazine, January 21, 1946 Steel plants thus made redundant were dismantled.
Also as a consequence of the Potsdam conference, the occupation  forces of all nations were obliged to ensure that German standards of living could not exceed the average level of European neighbors with which it had been at war, France in particular. Germany was to be reduced to the standard of life it had known in 1932.[tpl]qn|date=June 2013[/tpl].Cost of Defeat, Time Magazine, April 8, 1946 The first "level of industry" plan, signed in 1946, stated that German heavy industry was to be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the closing of 1,500 manufacturing plantsHenry C. Wallich. Mainsprings of the German Revival (1955) p. 348.
The problems brought on by the execution of these types of policies were eventually apparent to most U.S. officials in Germany. Germany had long been the industrial giant of Europe, and its poverty held back the general European recovery[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]. The continued scarcity in Germany also led to considerable expenses for the occupying powers, which were obligated to try and make up the most important shortfalls through the GARIOA program (Government and Relief in Occupied Areas). In view of the continued poverty and famine in Europe, and with the onset of the Cold War which made it important not to lose all of Germany to the communists, it was apparent by 1947 that a change of policy was required.
The change was heralded by Restatement of Policy on Germany, a famous speech by James F. Byrnes, then United States Secretary of State, held in Stuttgart on September 6, 1946.  Also known as the "Speech of hope" it set the tone of future US policy as it repudiated the Morgenthau Plan economic policies and with its message of change to a policy of economic reconstruction gave the Germans hope for the future. Herbert Hoover's situation reports from 1947, and "A Report on Germany" also served to help change occupation policy.  The Western powers' worst fear by now was that the poverty and hunger would drive the Germans to Communism. General Lucius Clay stated "There is no choice between being a communist on 1,500 calories a day and a believer in democracy on a thousand."
After lobbying by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Generals Clay and Marshall, the Truman administration realized that economic recovery in Europe could not go forward without the reconstruction of the German industrial base on which it had previously been dependent.  In July 1947, President Harry S. Truman rescinded on "national security grounds"[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks49.pdf | first = Ray Salvatore | last = Jennings | title = The Road Ahead: Lessons in Nation Building from Japan, Germany, and Afghanistan for Postwar Iraq |date=May 2003 | journal = Peaceworks | number = 49 | page = 15[/tpl] the punitive JCS 1067, which had directed the US forces of occupation in Germany to "take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany." It was replaced by JCS 1779, which instead stressed that "an orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany."
The most notable example of this change of policy was a plan established by U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall, the "European Recovery Program", better known as the Marshall Plan, which in the form of loans instead of the free aid received by other recipients was extended to also include West Germany.
 The Marshall Plan ... is not a philanthropic enterprise ... It is based on our views of the requirements of American security ... This is the only peaceful avenue now open to us which may answer the communist challenge to our way of life and our national security." (Allen W. Dulles, The Marshall Plan) "Marshall Plan 1947–1997, A German View" by Susan Stern 

==JCS 1067==

A Handbook for Military Government in Germany was ready in August 1944: it advocated a quick restoration of normal life for the German people and reconstruction of Germany.  Henry Morgenthau, Jr. brought it to the attention of President Franklin D. Roosevelt who, after reading it, rejected it with the words:
A new document was drafted, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directive 1067 (JCS 1067). Here the US military government of occupation in Germany was ordered to "…take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany or designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy" and it was also ordered that starvation, disease and civil unrest were to be kept below such levels where they would pose a danger to the troops of occupation.
The directive was formally issued to Eisenhower in the spring of 1945, and it applied only to the US zone (although attempts had been made to get the other Allies to accept it). The occupation directive remained secret until October 17, 1945. It was made known to the public two months after the US had succeeded in incorporating much of it into the Potsdam Agreement.James P. Warburg, Germany: Bridge or Battleground? (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1946), p. 279.
On May 10, 1945 Truman signed the JCS 1067.Department of State Bulletin, October 21, 1945, pp. 596–607. Ignoring the amendments to JCS 1067 that had been inserted by McCloy of the War Department, Morgenthau told his staff that it was a big day for the Treasury, and that he hoped that "someone doesn't recognize it as the Morgenthau Plan."[tpl]Sfn | Beschloss | p = 233[/tpl]
In occupied Germany Morgenthau left a direct legacy through what in OMGUS commonly were called  "Morgenthau boys". These were U.S. Treasury officials whom Dwight D. Eisenhower has "loaned" in to the Army of occupation. These people ensured that the JCS 1067 was interpreted as strictly as possible. They were most active in the first crucial months of the occupation, but continued their activities for almost two years following the resignation of Morgenthau in mid-1945 and some time later also of their leader Colonel Bernard Bernstein, who was "the repository of the Morgenthau spirit in the army of occupation".[tpl]Sfn | Petrov | 1967 | pp = 228–29[/tpl]
Morgenthau had been able to wield considerable influence over Joint Chiefs of Staff Directive 1067.  JCS 1067 was a basis for U.S. occupation policy until July 1947, and like the Morgenthau Plan, was intended to reduce German living standards.  The production of oil, rubber, merchant ships, and aircraft were prohibited.  Occupation forces were not to assist with economic development apart from the agricultural sector.
In his 1950 book Decision in Germany, Clay wrote, "It seemed obvious to us even then that Germany would starve unless it could produce for export and that immediate steps would have to be taken to revive industrial production".[tpl]Sfn | Petrov | 1967 | p = 18[/tpl]  Lewis Douglas, chief adviser to General Lucius Clay, U.S. High Commissioner, denounced JCS Directive 1067 saying, "This thing was assembled by economic idiots.  It makes no sense to forbid the most skilled workers in Europe from producing as much as they can in a continent that is desperately short of everything" Robert Murphy, "Diplomat Among Warriors", (London: 1964) p. 251. Douglas went to Washington in the hopes of having the directive revised but was unable to do so.
The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee asserted: "During the first two years of the Allied occupation the Treasury program of industrial dismantlement was vigorously pursued by American officials."[tpl]Sfn | Dietrich | 2002 | p = 85[/tpl]
In July 1947 JCS 1067, which had directed the U.S. forces of occupation in Germany to "...take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany or designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy", was replaced by JCS 1779 which instead stated that "An orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany."
It took over two months for General Clay to overcome continued resistance to the new directive JCS 1779, but on July 10, 1947, it was approved at a meeting of the SWNCC (State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee). The final version of the document "was purged of the most important elements of the Morgenthau plan."Vladimir Petrov, Money and conquest; allied occupation currencies in World War II. Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press (1967) p. 236 (Petrov footnotes Hammond, ''American Civil-Military Decisions, p. 443)
Vladimir Petrov, an expert on the financial aspects of the occupation, wrote: "By forbidding the American Army to maintain price, wage, and market controls, it (JCS 1067) literally decreed, as a State Department official put it, economic chaos."[tpl]Sfn | Dietrich | 2002 | p = 85[/tpl]
In 1947 the U.S. Congress warned that the continuation of the present policies
[tpl]quote |...can only mean one of two things, (a) That a considerable part of the German population must be "liquidated" through diseases, malnutrition, and slow starvation for a period of years to come, with the resultant dangers to the rest of Europe from pestilence and the spread of plagues that know no boundaries; or (b) the continuation both of large occupying forces to hold down "unrest" and the affording of relief mainly drawn from the United States to prevent actual starvation.[tpl]Sfn | Dietrich | 2002 | p = 99[/tpl][/tpl]
Conditions in Germany reached their lowest point in 1947. Living conditions were considered worse in 1947 than in 1945 or 1946. At an average ration of 1040 calories a day, malnutrition was at its worst stage in post-war Germany. Herbert Hoover asserted that this amount of rations was hardly more than the amount which caused thousands in the Nazi concentration camps to die from starvation.[tpl]Sfn | Dietrich | 2002 | p = 108[/tpl]
Vladimir Petrov concluded: "The victorious Allies... delayed by several years the economic reconstruction of the war torn continent, a reconstruction which subsequently cost the U.S. billions of dollars."[tpl]Sfn | Dietrich | 2002 | p = 88[/tpl]
In view of increased concerns by General Lucius D. Clay and the Joint Chiefs of Staff over communist influence in Germany, as well as of the failure of the rest of the European economy to recover without the German industrial base on which it was dependent, in the summer of 1947, Secretary of State George Marshall, citing "national security grounds," was able to convince President Harry S. Truman to remove JCS 1067, and replace it with JCS 1779. JCS 1067 had then been in effect for over two years.
The "Morgenthau boys" resigned en masse when the JCS 1779 was approved, but before they went, the Morgenthau followers in the decartelization division of OMGUS accomplished one last task in the spring of 1947: the destruction of the old German banking system.[tpl]Sfn | Petrov | 1967 | p = 237[/tpl]  By breaking the relationships between German banks, they cut off the flow of credit between them, limiting them to short-term financing only, thus preventing the rehabilitation of German industry and with immediate adverse effects on the economy in the U.S. occupation zone.[tpl]Sfn | Petrov | 1967 | p = 237[/tpl]
With the change of occupation policy, most significantly thanks to the currency reform of 1948, Germany eventually made an impressive recovery, later known as the Wirtschaftswunder ("economic miracle").

==Implementation==

The Morgenthau Plan was implemented,[tpl]Sfn | Gareau | 1961 | p = 530[/tpl] although not in its most extreme version.[tpl]Sfn | Gareau | 1961 | p = 530[/tpl]  The Morgenthau Plan spawned the JCS-1067,[tpl]Citation | url = http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga3-450426.pdf | format = PDF | place = DE | title = GA3 | format = etext | publisher = US Embassy[/tpl] which contained the ideas of making Germany a "Pastoral State". This concept's name was later changed to become "level of industry", where Germany's production was to be severely limited but not completely eliminated. No new locomotives were to be built until 1949, most industries were to have their production halved. Automobile production was to be set at 10% of its pre-war 1936 level, etc.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=10&documentid=22&documentdate=1947-03-24&studycollectionid=mp&nav=OK | publisher = Truman Library | title = Marshall[/tpl]
On February 2, 1946, a dispatch from Berlin reported:

Morgenthau had written a book outlining the full Morgenthau Plan, Germany is Our Problem.  In November 1945 General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Military Governor of the U.S. Occupation Zone, approved the distribution of one thousand free copies of the book to American military officials in Germany.[tpl]Sfn | Dietrich | 2002 | p = 27[/tpl]
By February 28, 1947 it was estimated that 4,160,000 German former prisoners of war, by General Dwight D. Eisenhower relabeled as Disarmed Enemy Forces in order to negate the Geneva Convention, were used as forced labor by the various Allied countries to work in camps outside Germany: 3,000,000 in Russia, 750,000 in France, 400,000 in Britain and 10,000 in Belgium.
Meanwhile in Germany large parts of the population were starving[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=11&documentid=24&documentdate=1947-02-28&studycollectionid=mp&nav=OK | date = 1947-02-28 | title = Truman library[/tpl] at a time when according to a study done by former U.S. President Herbert Hoover the nutritional condition in countries that in Western Europe was nearly pre-war normal".  General George S.

In Germany shortage of food was an acute problem, according to Alan S.

All armaments plants, including some that could have been converted to civilian operation, were dismantled or destroyed. A large proportion of operational civilian plants were dismantled and transported to the victorious nations, mainly France and Russia.

Early U.S. plans for "industrial disarmament" included detaching the Saarland and the Ruhr from Germany in order to remove much of the remaining industrial potential.[tpl]Sfn | Gareau | 1961 | p = 526[/tpl]
As late as March 1947 there were still active plans to let France annex the Ruhr.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]

The Saar, another important source of coal and industry for Germany, was likewise to be lost by the Germans. It was cut out from Germany and its resources put under French control. In 1955, the French, under pressure from West Germany and her newfound allies, held a plebiscite in the Saar Protectorate on the question of reunification or independence. Reunification won overwhelmingly, and on January 1, 1957, Saarland rejoined West Germany.
As Germany was allowed neither airplane production nor any shipbuilding capacity to supply a merchant navy, all facilities of this type were destroyed over a period of several years. A typical example of this activity by the allies was the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, where explosive demolition was still taking place as late as 1949. Everything that could not be dismantled was blown up or otherwise destroyed. A small-scale attempt to revive the company in 1948 ended with the owners and a number of employees being thrown in jail by the British.  It was not until 1953 that the situation gradually started to improve for the Blohm & Voss, thanks in part to repeated pleas by German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer to the Allied High Commissioners.ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, Press release, 2002-04-02 125 years Blohm + Voss
Timber exports from the U.S. occupation zone were particularly heavy. Sources in the U.S. government stated that the purpose of this was the "ultimate destruction of the war potential of German forests."U.S. office of Military Government, A Year of Potsdam: The German Economy Since the Surrender (1946), p. 70. As a consequence of the practiced clear-felling, extensive deforestation resulted which could "be replaced only by long forestry development over perhaps a century.".Nicholas Balabkins, Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects Of Industrial Disarmament 1945–1948 (Rutgers University Press, 1964) p. 119.U.S. Office of Military Government, The German Forest Resources Survey (1948), p. II.G.W. Harmssen, Reparationen, Sozialproduct, Lebensstandard (Bremen: F. Trujen Verlag, 1948), I, 48.
Over a period of years, American policy slowly changed away from this policy of "industrial disarmament". The first and main turning point was the speech "Restatement of Policy on Germany" held in Stuttgart by the United States Secretary of State James F. Byrnes on September 6, 1946.
Reports such as this by former U.S. President Herbert Hoover, dated March 1947, also argued for a change of policy, among other things through speaking frankly of the expected consequences.
In July 1947, President Harry S. Truman rescinded on "national security grounds" JCS 1067, which had directed the U.S. forces of occupation in Germany to "take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany."  Three months earlier, the United States and France had agreed upon a German POW release program to begin releasing 20,000 prisoners per month.[tpl]Sfn | Dietrich | 2002 | p = 134[/tpl]  By July, of the 740,000 German POWs transferred to France, 290,000 had been "stricken from the rolls."United States Department of State, Foreign relations of the United States, 1947.

In addition to the physical barriers that had to be overcome, for the German economic recovery there were also intellectual challenges. The Allies confiscated intellectual property of great value, all German patents both in Germany and abroad, and used them to strengthen their own industrial competitiveness by licensing them to Allied companies.[tpl]citation | first = C. Lester | last = Walker | format = MS Word .doc | url = http://www.scientistsandfriends.com/files/secrets.doc | title = Secrets by the Thousands | journal = Harper's Magazine | publisher = Scientists & friends |date=October 1946[/tpl]  Beginning immediately after the German surrender and continuing for the next two years, the U.S. pursued a vigorous program to harvest all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents in Germany. John Gimbel comes to the conclusion, in his book "Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany", that the "intellectual reparations" taken by the U.S. and the UK amounted to close to $10 billion.[tpl]citation | first = Norman M | last = Naimark | title = The Russians in Germany | page = 206[/tpl] (Naimark refers to Gimbels).The $10 billion compares to the U.S. annual GDP of $258 billion in 1948.The $10 billion compares to the total Marshall plan expenditure (1948–52) of $13 billion, of which Germany received $1,4 billion (partly as loans). During the more than two years that this policy was in place, no industrial research in Germany could take place[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl], as any results would have been automatically available to overseas competitors who were encouraged by the occupation authorities to access all records and facilities.  Meanwhile thousands of the best[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/aug/29/sciencenews.secondworldwar | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 2007-08-29 | title = Second World War science news[/tpl] German researchers were being put to work in the Soviet Union and in the U.K. and U.S. (see also Operation Paperclip).
According to some scholars, the Marshall Plan, which was extended to also include Western Germany after it was realized that the suppression of the Western German economy was holding back the recovery of the rest of Europe, was not the main force behind the Wirtschaftswunder.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.econlib.org/library/enc/GermanEconomicMiracle.html | title = German Economic "Miracle" | first = David R | last = Henderson[/tpl][tpl]Citation | publisher = Germany.info | url = http://www.germany.info/relaunch/culture/history/marshall.html | title = Marshall Plan 1947–1997: A German View | first = Susan | last = Stern[/tpl] According to them, the amount of monetary aid (which was in the form of loans) received by Germany through the Marshall Plan (about $1.4 billion in total) was far overshadowed by the amount the Germans had to pay back as war reparations and by the charges the Allies made on the Germans for the ongoing cost of occupation (about $2.4 billion per year). In 1953 it was decided that Germany was to repay $1.1 billion of the aid it had received.  The last repayment was made in June 1971.  In a largely symbolic 2004 resolution by the lower house of the Polish Parliament reparations of $640 billion were demanded from Germany, mainly as a weapon in an ongoing argument regarding German property claims on formerly German territory.[tpl]Citation | place = DE | url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1324630,00.html | title = Poles Vote to Seek War Reparations | newspaper = Deutsche Welle | date = 11 September 2004[/tpl]  However, at the Potsdam conference the Soviet Union undertook to settle the reparation claims of Poland from its own share of reparations from Germany.

In der rechtsextremen Publizistik spielt der Morgenthau-Plan diese Rolle bis zum heutigen Tag. early as the end of September 1944, the Morgenthau Plan sunk into oblivion without ever being formally discussed by the responsible bodies. For later policy relating to the occupation and Germany, the Morgethau Plan was of no significance whatsoever. But Goebbels and Hitler had  been so successful with their use of the "Jewish murder plan" for the "enslavemnent of Germany" in their last-ditch propaganda that  many people believed the programme had really received serious consideration.
