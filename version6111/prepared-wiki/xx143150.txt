==Background==

The album features mutual Metheny/Coleman collaborator Charlie Haden on bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums, and Coleman's son Denardo on various percussion instruments. It was recorded at The Power Station in New York City between December 12 and December 14, 1985.
A remixed and remastered version was issued on CD in August 2005, titled Song X: Twentieth Anniversary. Six unreleased tracks were added prior to the original eight songs.

==Critical reception==

In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau felt that Metheny's mild mannered style of jazz keeps the music uncluttered and that Song X is Coleman's best album of unadulterated jazz since the early 1970s: "No rock moves, and no funk, harmolodic or otherwiseâ€”it's all sweet lyricism, sonic comedy, and headlong invention."[tpl]cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=September 2, 1986|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv9-86.php|title=Christgau's Consumer Guide|newspaper=The Village Voice|location=New York|accessdate=November 28, 2013[/tpl] Down Beat magazine called the album "a remarkable union of the true and the new, a fusion of the bedrock human sound of Ornette's alto with the sometimes jarring, mostly bracing electronic capabilities of Pat's guitar-synth".[tpl]cite journal|title=Review: Song X|journal=Down Beat|location=Chicago|date=August 1986[/tpl] Jon Pareles, writing in The New York Times, said that the experiment succeeds because both artists are masterful melodists and found the album "less tangled and more directly songful than Mr. Coleman's recent albums with Prime Time".[tpl]cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Pareles|date=April 20, 1986|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/20/arts/jazz-s-odd-couple-join-forces-to-make-splendid-melody.html|title=Jazz's Odd Couple Join Forces to Make Splendid Melody|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=November 28, 2013[/tpl] Song X was voted the nineteenth best album of 1986 in The Village Voice[tpl]'[/tpl]s annual Pazz & Jop critics poll.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=The Village Voice|location=New York|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres86.php|title=The 1986 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|date=March 3, 1987[/tpl]
In his review of the album's 2005 reissue, Christgau wrote in Blender magazine that all six bonus tracks "are strong enough to justify kicking off with them, and the perfect warm-up to an album Metheny was right to construct exactly as he did."[tpl]cite journal|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=September 2005|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cdrev/metheny-ble.php|title=Pat Metheny/Ornette Coleman: 'Song X'|journal=Blender|location=New York|accessdate=November 28, 2013[/tpl] In his list for 2005 Pazz & Jop critics poll, he named its twentieth anniversary edition the sixteenth best album of the year.[tpl]cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=February 7, 2006|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/deans05.php|title=Pazz & Jop 2005: Dean's List|newspaper=The Village Voice|accessdate=November 28, 2013[/tpl]
