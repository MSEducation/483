Nurmijärvi ([tpl]IPA-fi|ˈnurmiˌjærʋi[/tpl]) is the most populated rural municipality of Finland, located [tpl]convert|37|km[/tpl] north of the capital Helsinki.
The close proximity to Helsinki has led to a considerable growth of the major villages such as Klaukkala and Rajamäki, which nowadays are considered dormitory towns of Helsinki. Klaukkala is the biggest built-up area of Nurmijärvi.
Nurmijärvi literally means "lawn lake" although the lake that gave the municipality its name was drained in the early 20th century and is now nothing more than some flat fields near the village centre.
Nurmijärvi is best known as the birthplace of Finland's national author, Aleksis Kivi (1834–1872). His play Nummisuutarit (The Cobblers of the Heath) – with colourful scenes of rural life in the 19th century Nurmijärvi parish – are performed in summer at an outdoor theatre in Palojoki, the village where Kivi was born.
Matti Vanhanen, former Prime Minister of Finland, lives in Lepsämä in Nurmijärvi.
