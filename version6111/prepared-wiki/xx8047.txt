[[Monoid ring]]

CATEGORIES: Ring theory

In abstract algebra, a monoid ring is a ring constructed from a ring and a monoid, just as a group ring is constructed from a ring and a group.

==Definition==

If G is a group, then RG is also called the group ring of G over R.

==Universal property==

Given R and G, there is a ring homomorphism [tpl]nowrap|α: R → RG[/tpl] sending each r to r1 (where 1 is the identity element of G),
and a monoid homomorphism [tpl]nowrap|β: G → RG[/tpl] (where the latter is viewed as a monoid under multiplication) sending each g to 1g (where 1 is the multiplicative identity of R).
We have that α(r) commutes with β(g) for all r in R and g in G.
The universal property of the monoid ring states that given a ring S, a ring homomorphism [tpl]nowrap|α': R → S[/tpl], and a monoid homomorphism [tpl]nowrap|β': G → S[/tpl] to the multiplicative monoid of S,
such that α'(r) commutes with β'(g) for all r in R and g in G, there is a unique ring homomorphism [tpl]nowrap|γ: RG → S[/tpl] such that composing α and β with γ produces α' and β
'.

==Augmentation==

The augmentation is the ring homomorphism [tpl]nowrap|η: RG → R[/tpl] defined by 
The kernel of η is called the augmentation ideal.  It is a free R-module with basis consisting of 1–g for all g in G not equal to 1.

==Examples==

Given a ring R and the (additive) monoid of natural numbers N (or {xn} viewed multiplicatively), we obtain the ring R{xn} =: Rx of polynomials over R.
The monoid Nn (with the addition) gives the polynomial ring with n variables: RNn =: R..., Xn.

==Generalization==

If G is a semigroup, the same construction yields a semigroup rng RG.
