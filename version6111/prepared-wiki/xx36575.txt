==History==

===Beginnings===

Upside was started by banker Anthony B. Perkins and technical writer Rich Karlgaard as a magazine "for Silicon Valley about Silicon Valley." Venture capitalist Tim Draper was the main initial backer, along with Silicon Valley Bank founder Roger Smith and Est√©e Lauder's grandson Gary Lauder. Jay Whitehead was its Managing Publisher.  In its early issues, the publication published controversial articles on investment firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Hambrecht & Quist. Upside quickly became widely read in the Silicon Valley tech community but burned through $3 million between 1989 and 1992 and was constantly trying to raise money.[tpl]cite news |title=Fish Story|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/1996-04-10/news/fish-story/4 |work=SF Weekly |publisher=Village Voice Media |date=1996-04-10 |accessdate=2009-11-28[/tpl]

===Departure of founders===

Perkins was removed by the magazine's board of directors as publisher on May 2, 1992. He would go on to start Red Herring (magazine), which had a similar focus to Upside. Within a month, Karlgaard left to become editor of Forbes ASAP.ibid.  Forbes ASAP was originally announced as a joint venture between Forbes and Upside, but Upside was excluded from the venture after the hiring of Karlgaard, and this angered magazine staff.[tpl]cite news |title=Fish Story|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/1996-04-10/news/fish-story/5 |work=SF Weekly |publisher=Village Voice Media |date=1996-04-10 |accessdate=2009-11-28[/tpl]
David Bunnell, an Upside board member and investor and a founder of PC World, Macworld and PC Magazine, was CEO from 1996-2002.[tpl]cite news |title=Upside's downside |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/04/01/BU240369.DTL |work=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=Hearst |date=2002-04-01 |accessdate=2009-11-28 | first=Dan | last=Fost[/tpl]

===Expansion===

In 1997, The Washington Post Company invested in Upside and announced the two companies would share editorial resources, collaborate online, sponsor conferences together and cooperate on ad sales and circulation development. The Washington Post Company said it selected Upside due to the magazine's tech news and connections in Silicon Valley.[tpl]cite news |title=Washington Post, Upside team to cover tech world |url=http://washington.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/1997/11/03/story8.html |work=Silicon Valley Business Journal |publisher=American City Business Journals |date=1997-10-31 |accessdate=2009-11-28[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
David Bunnell's son Aaron Bunnell joined Upside as a vice president in the late 1990s, in charge of the magazine's website UpsideToday. He struck a crucial deal with Yahoo that doubled traffic and launched a popular feature called "Dot-Com graveyard." Co-workers described him as a hard worker. In summer 2000, he was found dead in a hotel room in New York, where he had traveled to close an UpsideToday business deal. He had reportedly been using drugs, working long hours and grieving the loss of a girlfriend in the weeks leading up to his death.[tpl]cite news |title=Dealing with dot-com's dark side |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/dotcoms/dot035.htm |work=USA Today |publisher=Gannett Co.
