Richard Figlar notes that the Parakmeria yunnanensis is "often cultivated as street trees in their native Yunnan because of their 'Gallery Pear-type' growth habit and their exceptionally glossy evergreen foliage". He also notes that "their flowers are not as profuse and are less showy than those of other magnolia species".[tpl]cite web|url=http://toptropicals.com/html/toptropicals/articles/trees/tropical_magnolia.htm |title=Tropical Magnolias |accessdate=September 26, 2011[/tpl]
