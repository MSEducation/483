[[Convective condensation level]]

CATEGORIES: Severe weather and convection, Atmospheric thermodynamics

The convective condensation level (CCL) represents the height where an air parcel becomes saturated when lifted adiabatically to achieve buoyant ascent.
It marks where cloud base begins when air is heated from below to the convective temperature, without mechanical lift. Can be roughly approximated by taking the spread between the surface temperature and dewpoint and dividing by 4.4 (if temperatures are in °F) or 2.5 (if temperatures are in °C), then multiplying the result by 1000.
