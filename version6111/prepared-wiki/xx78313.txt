The flag of the Seychelles was adopted on June 18, 1996.  The oblique bands symbolize a dynamic new country moving into the future.  The colour blue depicts the sky and the sea that surrounds the Seychelles. Yellow is for the sun which gives light and life, red symbolizes the people and their determination to work for the future in unity and love, whilst the white band represents social justice and harmony. The green depicts the land and natural environment.
The original flag was adopted at independence on June 29, 1976. In 1977, when president James Mancham was overthrown by France-Albert Ren√©, the old flag was abolished and the red, white and green flag of the Seychelles People's United Party came into use.
