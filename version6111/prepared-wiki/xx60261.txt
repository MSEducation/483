Route 413 is a [tpl]convert|0.76|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] long state highway in New Jersey, United States. It is an eastward extension into New Jersey of the longer Pennsylvania Route 413. The western terminus is in Burlington in the middle of the Burlington–Bristol Bridge crossing of the Delaware River at the New Jersey–Pennsylvania state border; the eastern terminus is at an intersection with U.S. Route 130. Despite the east–west orientation, Route 413 runs north–south, but PA Route 413 is signed north–south. Prior to the 1953 renumbering, Route 413 was Route S25, a prefixed spur of New Jersey Route 25.

The highway heads northward, heading along Reed Street, and there is an intersection with Delaware Avenue West, and soon after, intersections with West Pearl Street, and a local highway. Passing a few residences, Route 413 intersects with West Pearl Street, and enters a more commercial type of region. The next intersection with Brown Street is jammed with houses, and nearby is a large parking lot.[tpl]yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=40.072568&lon=-74.86416&zoom=18&q1=40.071386%2C-74.864503&q2=40.081484%2C-74.869503 |title=overview map of NJ 413 |accessdate=2009-03-09[/tpl]
At the intersection with Veterans Drive and Conover Street, Route 413 splits into a divided highway, and the highway intersects with West Broad Street. After West Broad Street, Route 413 merges back in, passing several more commercial buildings and heading into John Fitzgerald Kennedy Park. The route parallels to the east of Washington Street, where it heads into a roundabout and terminates at an intersection with U.S. Route 130 (Camden Avenue) in Burlington.

==History==

thumb|left|100px|Route S25 (1927–1953)In the 1927 renumbering of highways in New Jersey, U.S. Route 130 was assigned as a part of New Jersey State Highway Route 25, which made up U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 9 as well. During that renumbering in 1927, Route 413 was originally New Jersey State Highway Route S-25, a prefixed spur of State Highway Route 25. The highway remained intact along its alignment in Keim Road to the Burlington–Bristol Bridge until January 1, 1953.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319.
On January 1, 1953, the New Jersey State Highway Department performed a second renumbering of state  highways. State Highway Route 25, which had run at the southern terminus with Route 130, was decommissioned for the sole designation. Since State Highway Route 25 was decommissioned, State Highway Route S-25 would be orphaned and was decommissioned that day. The Highway Department renumbered S-25's alignment to NJ 413, which continued as Pennsylvania Route 413.[tpl]Cite journal|title=1953 renumbering|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1953_New_Jersey_state_highway_renumbering|publisher=New Jersey Department of Highways|accessdate=July 31, 2009[/tpl]
