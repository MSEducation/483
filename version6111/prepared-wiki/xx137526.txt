==Remit==

Aladdin Paperbacks are aimed at readers aged 4 to 12 and most are reprints from other (hardcover) imprints, which include what Simon & Schuster term some of the most enduring children's books of the modern era. Its ranges include the "Ready-to-Read books," and the slightly older "Ready-for-Chapters" titles aimed at younger age-groups and beginners. Aladdin also publishes a "limited number" of original titles and series entries, across multiple genres including action, adventure, and relationships novels.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.simonsays.com/content/feature.cfm?sid=33&feature_id=5784 |title=About Simon & Schuster's Publishing Divisions and Imprints: Children's |publisher=Simon&Schuster.biz |accessdate=September 26, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100901142215/http://www.simonsays.com/content/feature.cfm?sid=33&feature_id=5784| archivedate= September 1, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl]
