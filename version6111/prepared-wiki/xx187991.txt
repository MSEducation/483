==History==

The current group of partners includes Morten Schmidt, Bjarne Hammer, John F. Lassen, Kim Holst Jensen and Kristian Lars Ahlmark along with four associate partners: Chris Hardie, Kasper Heiberg Frandsen, Rasmus Kierkegaard and Trine Berthold. Day-to-day management of the practice is the responsibility of CEO Bente Damgaard.
The practice had its major breakthrough with the Katuaq Culture Centre in Nuuk, Greenland, completed in 1997. The project in Nuuk was followed by first prize in the international competition for the extension of the Danish Royal Library on the harborfront in Copenhagen. Completed in 1999, the library extension, also known as the Black Diamond, has become one of the practice’s most known buildings.
Another major project is the ARoS Art Museum in Aarhus, Denmark, which was completed in 2004. In May 2011 the art work Your rainbow panorama, by Olafur Eliasson, was officially unveiled on the roof top of the museum.
In 2010 schmidt hammer lassen architects won the competition to design the first permanent premises for the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, the Netherlands. The ICC is the first permanent, treaty-based, international criminal court established to help end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. It was founded in 2002 and has grown to the present-day size of 122 member countries. The building is designed to convey hope, trust and faith in justice.
