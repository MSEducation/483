Western Visayas (Filipino: Kanlurang Kabisayaan; Katundanan Bisayás (Hiligaynon); Kasadpangang Bisayás (Cebuano)) is one of the regions of the Philippines, designated as Region VI. It consists of six provinces; Aklan, Antique, Negros Occidental, Capiz, Guimaras and Iloilo and 16 cities making it the region with the highest number of cities. Iloilo City is the regional center.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iloilocity.gov.ph/iloiloct2011wip/seprofile.php|accessdate=June 28, 2012|title=History of Urban Growth of Iloilo City|publisher=Iloilo City Government[/tpl]
Western Visayas is composed of six provinces and the highly urbanized cities of Bacolod and Iloilo.

==History==

The Western Visayas region was created from Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Iloilo (including its then-subprovince of Guimaras) and Negros Occidental by Presidential Decree No. 1 as part of the Integrated Reorganisation Plan of President Ferdinand Marcos.
The Province of Palawan was transferred to Region VI (Western Visayas) on May 23, 2005 by Executive Order 429. The Department of the Interior and Local Government announced in June 2005 that the transfer had been completed.[ref]

However, Palaweños criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa City and all municipalities but one preferring to stay with Region IV-B. Consequently, Administrative Order No. 129 was issued on August 19, 2005 to address this backlash.  This Order directed the abeyance of Executive Order 429 pending the approval of an implementation plan for the orderly transfer of Palawan from Region IV-B to Region VI.
Hence, Palawan is currently still part of Region IV-B.
