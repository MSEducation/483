==Career==

Berry was born in Liverpool, and played for Gosport Borough before beginning his professional career with Portsmouth. He made his League debut at the age of 18, on 29 August 1981 in the starting eleven for the Third Division home draw with Lincoln City. He played 35 games in all competitions and scored three goals in the 1981–82 season, but played rarely after the arrival of Bobby Campbell as manager.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pompeyrama.com/pompey-fc-players-41-Steve-Berry.html |title=Player Stats Steve Berry |work=Pompeyrama |accessdate=16 December 2009[/tpl] He joined Aldershot on loan in March 1984 and moved to First Division Sunderland on a free transfer in July 1984.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=38378 |title=Steve Berry Sunderland FC |work=Football Heroes |publisher=Sporting Heroes Collections |accessdate=16 December 2009[/tpl]
Aged 21, he made his Sunderland debut on 25 August 1984 in a 3–1 win at home to Southampton. He made 45 league and cup appearances including the League Cup Final at Wembley that season.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thestatcat.co.uk/Mplayers/MPG161.asp |title=Player Details Steve Berry |publisher=The StatCat |accessdate=18 December 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engleagcuphistfinal.html |title=England – League Cup Finals 1961–2001 |publisher=RSSSF |date=25 February 2001 |first=Didier |last=Fort |accessdate=16 December 2009[/tpl] Sunderland were relegated at the end of the 1984–85 season and he found himself out of favour after the arrival of Lawrie McMenemy as manager. He played just one game early the following season, and was transferred to Newport County for £20,000 in December 1985.
Sometime later, Newport were facing financial problems and Berry was approached by Lou Macari at Swindon Town and subsequently sold for £15,000. He spent six months at Swindon Town, playing three league and all the play-off games as the club gained promotion to the Second Division, then joined Aldershot in October 1987 in part-exchange for Bobby Barnes,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.swindon-town-fc.co.uk/Person.asp?PersonID=BERRYSTE |title=Player Profile Steve Berry |work=Swindon-Town-FC |accessdate=16 December 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.shots2692.co.uk/where%20are%20they%20A-H.html |title=Where Are They Now?

Returning to England, he joined Stevenage Borough, whom he captained to the Conference National title in 1995–96.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fcboro.co.uk/boro-legends/ |title=Boro Legends |publisher=FC Boro |accessdate=18 December 2009[/tpl] He moved to Kettering Town, where he scored six goals from 89 appearances in all competitions, was club captain and then player-manager, following the dismissal of Gary Johnson. Steve guided Kettering to respectable mid table positions for two seasons on severely restricted budgets. Following the decision by the Poppies chairman Peter Mallinger to again slash the playing budget, Berry announced his resignation before rejoining Stevenage as a player for the following season.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.poppiesfans.com/playerdetails.php?recordID=B14 |title=Player Profile Steve Berry |publisher=Poppies Fans |accessdate=16 December 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] He spent time working for Brian Talbot at Rushden & Diamonds, as both player and coach,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thediamondsfc.com/page/A-ZofDiamonds/0,,10784~1219415,00.html |title=Steve Berry |publisher=Rushden & Diamonds F.C |accessdate=16 December 2009[/tpl] and, coming out of retirement following two operations on his achilles tendon, at Bedford Town.
