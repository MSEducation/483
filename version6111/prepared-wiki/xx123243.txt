[[Starry Plough (flag)]]

CATEGORIES: Flags of Ireland

The Starry Plough banner ([tpl]lang-ga|An Camchéachta[/tpl]) was originally used by the Irish Citizen Army, a socialist, Republican movement. James Connolly, co-founder of the Irish Citizen Army with Jack White, said the significance of the banner was that a free Ireland would control its own destiny from the plough to the stars.
The original Starry plough was unveiled in 1914 and flown by the Irish Citizen Army during the 1916 Easter Rising. The flag depicts the constellation of Ursa Major, known as The Plough in Ireland and Britain, or in the US, the Big Dipper, one of the most prominent features of the night sky over Ireland throughout the year.
While similar to the state flag of Alaska, it predates Alaska's by more than a decade.

Labour adopted the rose as its official emblem in 1991 but continue to use the Starry Plough for ceremonial occasions. It is also claimed by Irish republicans and has been carried alongside the Irish tricolour and Irish provincial flags and the sunburst flag, as well as the Red flag at Provisional IRA, Continuity IRA, Official IRA and Irish National Liberation Army rallies.
