[[Royal Audiencia of Mexico]]

CATEGORIES: New Spain, Colonial Mexico, 1527 establishments, Real Audiencias

The Royal Audience of Mexico ([tpl]lang-es|Real Audiencia de México[/tpl]) was the highest tribunal of the Spanish crown in the Kingdom of New Spain or the Kingdom of Mexico (not to be confused with the Viceroyalty of New Spain— named after the kingdom—which had a higher hierarchy and controller).  It was created by royal decree on December 13, 1527, and was seated in Mexico City.

==Background==

Hernán Cortés decided to establish a government in the town of Coyoacán, south of Lake Texcoco, because Tenochtitlan was in ruins after the conquest.  From here he governed with the title of Captain General and Justicia Mayor.  Also from Coyoacán left many of the expeditions of conquest with the goal of subduing the indigenous peoples of the various regions that would become the Viceroyalty of New Spain.
The first Real Audiencia in Mexico was created in 1528 and headed by the corrupt Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán, who was opposed by the first bishop of Mexico, Juan de Zumárraga.  Four years later, in 1532, the Viceroyalty of New Spain was created, although the first Viceroy, Antonio de Mendoza, would not arrive in Mexico until 1535. The Viceroy took over the executive functions of government from the Audiencia and served as its President. In the following decade as more mainland civilizations were conquered a second audiencia was created in Guadalajara.
