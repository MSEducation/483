==Background==

The feud between Goldust and Hunter Hearst Helmsley centered around Goldust's manager, Marlena. During the free broadcast prior to In Your House 12, Helmsley attempted to seduce Marlena.[tpl]cite web|title=WWF Raw: December 16, 1996|work=The Other Arena|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1996/raw121696|accessdate=2008-02-11[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Goldust responded by attacking Helmsley during matches in the following weeks. The feud escalated on the December 30, 1996 episode of Monday Night Raw during a match between Goldust and Jerry Lawler. Helmsley came to the ring and tried to carry Marlena away. Marc Mero, who had dropped the WWF Intercontinental Championship to Helmsley, blocked Helmsley's path, but the distraction was enough to cause Goldust to be counted out.[tpl]cite web|title=WWF Raw: December 30, 1996|work=The Other Arena|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1996/raw123096|accessdate=2008-02-11[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
On July 22, 1996, Faarooq Asad (later Faarooq) made his WWF debut by attacking Ahmed Johnson, the Intercontinental champion.[tpl]cite web|title=WWF Raw: July 22, 1996|work=The Other Arena|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1996/raw072296|accessdate=2008-02-10|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080212225059/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1996/raw072296 |archivedate=2008-02-12[/tpl] He claimed that he attacked Johnson because Johnson was not "from the streets", as Faarooq claimed to be.[tpl]cite web|title=Wrestler Profiles: Ron Simmons|work=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/r/ron-simmons.html|accessdate=2008-02-10[/tpl] Soon after the attack, Johnson was diagnosed with a legitimate kidney problem, so the WWF claimed that Faarooq's attack had hospitalized Johnson.[tpl]cite web|title=World Wrestling Entertainment Substitutions|work=Softwolves|url=http://www.softwolves.pp.se/wrestling/wwf/substitutions#y96|accessdate=2008-02-10[/tpl] Johnson was unable to compete for several months and was forced to vacate the Intercontinental Championship.[tpl]cite web|title=WWF/WWE Intercontinental Title|work=Wrestling Titles|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwe/ic.html|accessdate=2008-02-10[/tpl] When Johnson returned to the WWF, he interfered in several matches involving Faarooq's stable, the Nation of Domination. He attacked them with a two-by-four, which led to an angle in which Johnson was suspended for the attacks. By December, Johnson's injury had recovered sufficiently to allow him to resume wrestling, and a match was scheduled for the next pay-per-view, the Royal Rumble.
Vader and The Undertaker did not have a substantial buildup to their match at Royal Rumble 1997. Vader had joined other heel wrestlers to attack The Undertaker on several occasions, but there was no major storyline behind their match.[tpl]cite web|title=WWF Raw: January 13, 1997|work=The Other Arena|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw011397|accessdate=2008-02-11[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The Undertaker had been involved in a feud with Paul Bearer that dated back to SummerSlam 1996, when Bearer had turned on The Undertaker.[tpl]cite web|title=The Undertaker|work=SLAM!

The feud between Sycho Sid and Shawn Michaels dated back to 1995. The storyline saw Michaels hire Sid to be in his corner during the Michaels vs. Diesel main event at WrestleMania XI. Sid interfered in the match by distracting the referee, but the plan backfired when the referee was unable to count the pinfall after Michaels superkicked Diesel.[tpl]cite web|title=WrestleMania 11|work=The Other Arena|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1995/wwf040295|accessdate=2008-02-08|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080212225052/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1995/wwf040295 |archivedate=2008-02-12[/tpl] On the following night's episode of Monday Night Raw, Michaels told Sid that he would not be needed in the case of a Michaels vs. Diesel rematch.[tpl]cite web|title=WWF RAW: April 3, 1995|work=The Other Arena|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1995/raw040395|accessdate=2008-02-08|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080122082427/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1995/raw040395 |archivedate=2008-01-22[/tpl] Sid responded by turning on Michaels and powerbombing him three times. This attack led to a feud between Sid and Diesel, but Sid and Michaels were reunited as partners in an elimination match at Survivor Series 1995. During the match, Michaels accidentally kicked Sid in the face, which led to Sid being eliminated.[tpl]cite web|title=Survivor Series 1995 Re-Revued|work=Online Onslaught|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/ooldtyme/20041014.shtml|accessdate=2008-02-08[/tpl] Sid retaliated by powerbombing Michaels again. Once again, the feud was not developed, as Sid left the WWF.[tpl]cite web|title=Wrestler Profiles: Sid Vicious|work=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/sid-vicious.html|accessdate=2008-02-09[/tpl] Sid returned to the WWF on the July 8, 1996 episode of Monday Night Raw when  Michaels introduced him as a partner in a six-man match at In Your House 9.[tpl]cite web|title=Ring Results: 1996|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/96.htm|accessdate=2008-02-09|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071204101558/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/96.htm |archivedate=2007-12-04[/tpl] Sid helped Michaels several times in the coming months by saving him from attacks by other wrestlers. At In Your House 11, Sid defeated Vader to win a WWF Championship match against Michaels at Survivor Series 1996.[tpl]cite web|title=WWF IYH: Buried Alive|work=Online Onslaught|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/ooldtyme/20050209.shtml|accessdate=2008-02-09[/tpl] During the match at Survivor Series, Sid attacked Jose Lothario, Michaels' manager, with a television camera.[tpl]cite web|title=WWF Survivor Series 1996 Re-Revued|work=Online Onslaught|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/ooldtyme/20050223.shtml|accessdate=2008-02-09[/tpl] While Michaels was distracted, Sid hit him with the camera and powerbombed him to win the title. A rematch was later booked for Royal Rumble 1997.

==Event==

The first match that aired was an Intercontinental Championship match between Goldust and the champion, Hunter Hearst Helmsley. Before the match began, Goldust attacked Helmsley up the aisle, but they then returned to the ring where they continued to brawl back and forth. Later into the match, Helmsley would attempt to hit Goldust with the Intercontinental Championship belt, however, Goldust countered and grabbed the belt and hit Helmsley with it, and as Goldust attempted to pin Helmsley, Mr. Hughes, who was at ringside as bodyguard for Helmsley, pulled Helmsley out of the ring. Hughes then continued his distraction on Goldust, which led to Helmsley deliviring a Pedigree and pinning Goldust for the win, thus Helmsley retained the Intercontinental Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.softwolves.pp.se/wrestling/wwf/1997#rr97|title=Royal Rumble 1997|accessdate=2008-02-18|date=1997-01-21|publisher=AWT[/tpl] The next match was the encounter of Faarooq and Ahmed Johnson. Johnson won the match after members of the Nation of Domination, who were at ringside, interfered on Faarooq's behalf.
The third match was the encounter of The Undertaker and Vader. Undertaker gained control early into the match, however, Vader gained control after Paul Bearer, who was at ringside in Vader's corner, hit Undertaker with an urn. The Undertaker did not retaliate, as Vader hit a Vaderbomb on him, which gained a successful pinfall for the win. The next match was a six-man tag team match between the team of Héctor Garza, Perro Aguayo, and El Canek against the team of Jerry Estrada, Heavy Metal, and Fuerza Guerrera. A slow paced match between the two teams, as they exchange control of the match back and forth. Late into the match, the two teams brawled outside of the ring, as Aguayo hit Metal with a diving double foot stomp off the top rope, which gained a successful pinfall, thus Garza, Aguayo and Canek won the match.
The fourth, and final, match on the undercard was the Royal Rumble match.  The match began with Ahmed Johnson and Crush, where the rivalry with Johnson and Faarooq continued, as Johnson eliminated himself after Faarooq came down the aisle to chase him. The final five wrestlers were The Undertaker, Vader, Bret Hart, "Diesel", and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The first of those wrestlers to be tossed over the top rope was Austin, who entered the Rumble fifth and who was thrown out by Hart. However, the officials were occupied trying to separate Terry Funk and Mankind, who were brawling with each other outside the ring, and thus no one saw Austin's elimination. Meanwhile, Vader and Undertaker began brawling with each other as a continuation of their feud and Hart began fighting with "Diesel" as Austin reentered the ring. Austin dumped both Undertaker and Vader out of the ring, while Hart eliminated "Diesel". As Hart was celebrating, thinking he had won, Austin came in from behind and tossed him over the top rope. Since Austin was still considered to be in the match and was the only man left in the ring, the officials declared him the winner. With ten eliminations, Austin tied with Hulk Hogan for the most eliminations in single Royal Rumble match until Kane topped  them both with 11 in 2001.
The main event was a WWF Championship match between Shawn Michaels and Sycho Sid. Sid dominated most of the match and works over on Michaels's back early into the match, however Michaels retaliated by hitting a flying elbow drop on Sid. Michaels then attempts to deliver a Sweet Chin Music to Sid, however, he counters by tossing Michaels over the top rope onto ringside. As Sid threw Michaels back into the ring, Michaels accidentally hit referee Earl Hebner. Sid then delivered a Chokeslam and attempted to pin him, however, as the first referee was down, a second referee came out to count the pin, which got a two count. Sid then attacked the second referee, which allowed Michaels to hit Sid with a camera and delivered Sweet Chin Music, as the original referee slowly counted the successful pinfall, thus Michaels won the WWF Championship.

==Aftermath==

Shawn Michaels later vacated the WWF Championship on the Thursday Raw Thursday special.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/1997.html|title=RAW results – 1997|accessdate=2008-02-04|publisher=Online World of Wrestling[/tpl] Due to this and the controversial situation over the Royal Rumble ending, Steve Austin, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, and Vader were pitted against each other at In Your House 13: Final Four in a Four Corners match for the WWF Championship,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/february/1997.htm|title=WWF In Your House 13: Final Four|accessdate=2008-02-04|publisher=PWWEW.net[/tpl] which saw Hart win the vacant WWF title.
