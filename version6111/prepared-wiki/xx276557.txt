==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Steven Chorney was born in 1951, Washington, DC. Raised in Buffalo, NY, and having no formal art education, Chorney moved to Southern California in 1971 to pursue his dream of becoming a visual artist. "My father was trained as a commercial artist in Toronto, Canada.  It may be said that he made the largest impact on my decision to follow this chosen field."Chuck Redux, Interview with Steven Chorney--Movie Poster & TV Campaign Artist, March 10, 2009 http://blog.chuckjones.com/chuck_redux/2009/03/interview-with-steven-chorneymovie-poster-campaign-artist.html
Chorney landed a position with a small independent agency on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, animating and designing television commercials. In 1976, his entry to the Chicago International Film Festival garnered the First Place Award for Animated Television Commercials.
Later, while creating numerous freelance assignments for the recording industry the marketing departments of some of the major Hollywood studios began to take note.  "A turning point came" relates the artist, "with the creation of a movie poster design for the film Lassiter starring Tom Selleck and Jane Seymour." The bold approach was a departure from the standard montage often seen. Others took note as well, and the assignments began to come in. "I like to think it was something I did...but more truthfully, I was in the right place at the right time."
