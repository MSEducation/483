Kay Musical Instrument Company was a prolific American manufacturer of musical instruments that operated from the 1930s through the 1960s. Although Kay's first electric guitar was offered in 1936 (the same year as Gibson ES-150, five years after the Frying pan), Kay is known as an electric guitar pioneer  because their past company Stromberg-Voisinet produced the first commercial electric guitar, the Stromberg Electro, in 1928.
