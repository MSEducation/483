</ref> Targeting gene products directly to the ER (by the addition of an [[amino-terminal]] insertion [[protein sequence|sequence]]) should thus enhance CTL responses. This has been successfully demonstrated using recombinant [[vaccinia]] viruses expressing [[influenza]] proteins,<ref name=Restifo1995 /> but the principle should be applicable to DNA vaccines too. Targeting antigens for intracellular degradation (and thus entry into the MHC class I pathway) by the addition of [[ubiquitin]] signal sequences, or mutation of other signal sequences, has also been shown to be effective at increasing CTL responses.<ref name=Tobery1997 />
CTL responses can also be enhanced by co-inoculation with co-stimulatory molecules such as B7-1 or B7-2 for DNA vaccines against influenza nucleoprotein,[ref]
