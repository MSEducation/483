[[4-Methylcatechol]]

CATEGORIES: Natural phenols

4-Methylcatechol is a chemical compound. It is a component of castoreum, the exudate from the castor sacs of the mature beaver.Pheromonal activity of single castoreum constituents in beaver,Castor canadensis., Müller-Schwarze, D and Houlihan, P.W., Journal of Chemical Ecology, April 1991, Volume 17, Number 4, Springer Netherlands, [tpl]doi|10.1007/BF00994195[/tpl]

==Metabolism==

The enzyme cis-1,2-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-carboxylate dehydrogenase uses cis-1,2-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-carboxylate and NAD(P)+ to produce 4-methylcatechol, NADH, NADPH and CO2.[tpl]cite journal | author = Whited GM, McCombie WR, Kwart LD, Gibson DT | date = 1986 | title = Identification of cis-diols as intermediates in the oxidation of aromatic acids by a strain of Pseudomonas putida that contains a TOL plasmid | journal = J.

==Related compounds==

Members of the monocot subfamily Amaryllidoideae present a unique type of alkaloids, the norbelladine alkaloids, which are 4-methylcatechol derivatives combined with tyrosine. They are responsible for the poisonous properties of a number of the species. Over 200 different chemical structures of these compounds are known, of  which 79 or more are known from Narcissus alone.Martin, S.F. 1987. The Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids. In.: Arnold Brossi (ed.)

==Production==

The brand of low-temperature coke used as a smokeless fuel Coalite obtains homocatechol from ammoniacal liquor by solvent extraction, distillation and crystallisation.
