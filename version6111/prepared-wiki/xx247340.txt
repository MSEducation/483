[[Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium]]

CATEGORIES: Emergency medical services

The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) is a network of eleven regional clinical centers and a data coordinating center. The consortium conducts experimental and observational studies of out-of-hospital treatments of cardiac arrest and trauma. 
ten communities in the United States and Canada doing uniform quality improvement, clinical trials, and tracking of cardiac arrest and major trauma. The network is coordinated by the University of Washington Clinical Trial Center.  ROC is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Institute of Circulatory and Respiratory Health, United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, Defence Research and Development Canada, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, and American Heart Association.
