==Controversy==

The song caused mild controversy[tpl]cn|date=October 2013[/tpl] when released because of its assertion that the Catholic Church collaborated with the Nazis: "Oh Pope he got the Nazis, To clean up their messes, In exchange for gold and paintings, he gave them new addresses". In addition, the song contains a brief audio clip of Adolf Hitler at one of his rallies. The lyrics also borrow from the traditional hymn O come all ye faithful.
