Sony Spin is a Latin American cable television channel, launched on May 1, 2011, replacing the local version of Animax.
==History== 
Animax, being Sony's first attempt to offer a 24-hour anime channel in Latin America, it was planned to broadcast the series in two formats. The series containing 25 episodes or more (the majority, not all of them), would be aired at weekdays, whereas the series with a less last than 25 episodes would be shown at certain days of the week, much like it's done in Japan. In total, it is usual to find in one day a premiere episode of a series and as minimal 2 encores. Also, at the end of every series, the channel airs a section called Animedia, which shows video clips of Japanese artists' songs, extra information about anime and other themes, summaries of events dedicated to anime and presentations about future series for the channel. As of January 2007, they air a segment called Animax Nius (Nius = News), a teaser that features news related to anime and other topics.
As of 2011, anime has been relegated to late nights, as Western programming has taken over most of Animax's airtime. In May 1, 2011, the channel had been renamed Sony Spin, and changed most of its programming, even removing its anime programming at late nights.
