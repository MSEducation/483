[[List of Polish monarchs]]

CATEGORIES: Polish monarchs, Polish history timelines, Lists of monarchs, Lists of Polish people

Poland, or at least its nucleus, was ruled at various times either by dukes (the 10th–14th century) or by kings (the 11th-18th century). The longest-reigning dynasties were the Piasts (ca. 960–1370) and Jagiellonians (1386–1572). Intervening and subsequent monarchs were often rulers of foreign countries or princes recruited from foreign dynasties.
During the latter period, a tradition of free election of monarchs made it a uniquely electable position in Europe (16th–18th centuries). Polish independence ended with the Third Partition of Poland (1795) and was restored at the end of World War I (1918) on a republican basis.
