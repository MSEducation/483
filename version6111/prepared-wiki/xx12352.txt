Williams College is a private liberal arts college located in Williamstown, Massachusetts, United States. It was established in 1793 with funds from the estate of Ephraim Williams. Originally a men's college, Williams became co-educational in 1970. Fraternities were also phased out during this period, beginning in 1962.[tpl]cite web|title=Elimination of fraternities |url=http://wso.williams.edu/wiki/index.php/Elimination_of_fraternities |accessdate = 2007-09-19[/tpl] Williams forms part of the historic Little Three colleges, along with Wesleyan University and rival Amherst College.

==History==

Colonel Ephraim Williams was an officer in the Massachusetts militia and a member of a prominent landowning family. His will included a bequest to support and maintain a free school to be established in the town of West Hoosac, Massachusetts, provided that the town change its name to Williamstown. Williams was killed at the Battle of Lake George on September 8, 1755.[ref]

After Shays' Rebellion, the Williamstown Free School opened with 15 students on October 26, 1791. The first president was Ebenezer Fitch. Not long after its founding, the trustees of the school petitioned the Massachusetts legislature to convert the free school to a tuition-based college. The legislature agreed and on June 22, 1793, Williams College was chartered.  It was the second college to be founded in Massachusetts.
At its founding, the college maintained a policy of racial segregation, refusing admission to black applicants. This policy was challenged by Lucy Terry Prince, who is credited as the first black American poet,[tpl]cite book|last=James|first=Edward T.|title=Notable American Women, 1607-1950, Vol. III|year=1971|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0674627345|page=573[/tpl] when her son Festus was refused admission to the college on account of his race.[tpl]cite book|last=Phelps|first=John Wolcott and Rodney B.

More recent scholarship, however, has highlighted how there are no records within the college itself to confirm that this event occurred, and that Festus Prince may have been refused entry for an insufficient mastery of Latin, Greek, and French, all of which were necessary for successful completion of the entrance exam at the time, and which would most likely not have been available in the local schools of Guilford, Vermont, where Festus was raised.[tpl]cite journal|last=Proper|first=David R.|title=Lucy Terry Prince: "Singer of History"|journal=Contributions in Black Studies: A Journal of African and Afro-American Studies|date=January 1992|volume=9|series=15|page=14|url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cibs/vol9/iss1/15?utm_source=scholarworks.umass.edu%2Fcibs%2Fvol9%2Fiss1%2F15&utm_medium=PDF&utm_campaign=PDFCoverPages|accessdate=17 March 2013[/tpl]
In 1806, a student prayer meeting gave rise to the American Foreign Mission Movement.  In August of that year, five students met in the maple grove of Sloan's Meadow to pray. A thunderstorm drove them to the shelter of a haystack, and the fervor of the ensuing meeting inspired them to take the Gospel abroad. The students went on to build the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the first American organization to send missionaries overseas.  The Haystack Monument near Mission Park on the Williams Campus commemorates the historic "Haystack Prayer Meeting".
By 1815, Williams had only two buildings and 58 students and was in financial trouble, so the board voted to move the college to Amherst, Massachusetts.  In 1821, the president of the college, Zephaniah Swift Moore, who had accepted his position believing that the college would move east, decided to proceed with the move.  He took 15 students with him, and refounded the college under the name of Amherst College.  Some students and professors decided to stay behind at Williams and were allowed to keep the land, which was at the time relatively worthless.  According to legend, Moore also took portions of the Williams College library. Though plausible, the transfer of books is unsubstantiated. Moore died just two years later after founding Amherst, and was succeeded by Heman Humphrey, a trustee of Williams College.[ref]
