==Opinion polls==

Since the 2003 general election, several polls have been conducted to determine the current preference of voters. They showed a  decline in Liberal support following the 2004 Ontario budget. Overall, support for the governing Liberals has declined slightly since the 2003 election, the NDP has gained some ground since the 2003 election, and the PCs' poll numbers have not changed significantly since 2003.  Support for the Green Party has increased significantly, a shift which parallels the increase in support for the party's federal counterpart. During the pre-election period, the Ontario Greens did not appear as an option in some of the polls.
Polls indicate results for decided voters. More information can be found in the footnotes to each poll, including undecided results, if provided by the pollster.  A dash indicates the absence of a prompt for that party.
