A franchise commitment was to increase the hourly London Liverpool Street and Norwich services to half hourly. The half hourly service was introduced in 2000 with some extended to Sheringham, Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft. Due to the new stock for these running late, Class 317s were used for a time.
With funding from the Strategic Rail Authority's Rail Partnership Funding, Anglia introduced a new experimental service from the Great Eastern Main Line via the North London Line to Basingstoke branded London Crosslink. It operated from 22 May 2000 until ceasing on 28 September 2002 due to poor loadings.Rail Magazine Issue 446 16 Oct 2002 page 18

To meet a franchise commitment to operate two services per hour between London Liverpool Street and Norwich, Anglia Railways eight three-carriage Class 170s were delivered in 2000. A further four two-carriage Class 170s were delivered in 2002.
The three-carriage Class 170s were used on new services from London Liverpool Street to Sheringham, Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft, on London Crosslink services as well as being hired to GB Railways' Hull Trains operation to work London King's Cross to Hull services. The two-carriage examples were principally used on the new Norwich to Cambridge services.
