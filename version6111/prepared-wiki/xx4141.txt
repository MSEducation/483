==Early years==

Laxness was born under the name Halldór Guðjónsson (following the tradition of Icelandic patronymics) in Reykjavík in 1902, the son of Guðjón Helgason and Sigríður Halldórsdóttir. In 1905 his family moved from Reykjavík to Laxnes (Mosfellsveit, now part of Mosfellsbær, the rural part outside of the town centerhttp://www.gljufrasteinn.is/en/about_gljufrasteinn/how_to_get_there/), about 15 km northeast of the capital. He soon started to read books and write stories. At the age of 14 his first article was published in the newspaper Morgunblaðið under the name "H.G." His first book, the novel Barn náttúrunnar (Child of Nature), was published in 1919.Guðmundsson, p. 33 At the time of its publication he had already begun his travels on the European continent.Guðmundsson, p. 34

==1920s==

In 1922, Laxness joined the Abbaye St. Maurice et St. Maur in Clervaux, Luxembourg. The monks followed the rules of Saint Benedict of Nursia. Laxness was baptized and confirmed in the Catholic Church early in 1923. Following his confirmation, he adopted the surname Laxness (in honor of the homestead where he had been raised) and added the name Kiljan (an Icelandic spelling of the Irish martyr Saint Killian).
Inside the walls of the abbey, he practiced self-study, read books, and studied French, Latin, theology and philosophy. While there, he composed the story Undir Helgahnjúk, published in 1924. Soon after his baptism, he became a member of a group which prayed for reversion of the Nordic countries back to Catholicism. Laxness wrote of his experiences in the book Vefarinn mikli frá Kasmír: "The essential feature of Vefarinn mikli is the witches' brew of ideas presented in a stylistic furioso of style."Hallberg, Peter, Halldór Laxness. Twayne Publishers, New York, translated by Rory McTurk, 1971, pp.35, 38  The novel, published in 1927, "... created a sensation in Iceland and was hailed by Kristján Albertsson as the epoch-making book it really was. In the future Laxness was always in the vanguard of stylistic development..."Einarsson, Stefán A History of Icelandic Literature, New York: Johns Hopkins for the American Scandinavian Foundation, 1957, p. 291 OCLC 264046441
"Laxness's religious period did not last long; during a visit to America he became attracted to socialism."Halldór Laxness biography. nobelprize.org Partly under the influence of Upton Sinclair, who he befriended in California, "... Laxness joined the socialist bandwagon... with a book Alþýðubókin (The Book of the People, 1929) of brilliant burlesque and satirical essays... one of a long series in which he discussed his many travel impressions (Russia, Western Europe, South America), unburdened himself of socialistic satire and propaganda, and wrote of the literature and the arts, essays of prime importance to an understanding of his own art..."Einarsson, pp. 292, 316–17
Laxness lived in the United States and attempted to write screenplays for Hollywood films between 1927 and 1929.Einarsson, p. 317

==1930s==

By the 1930s he "had become the apostle of the younger generation" and was attacking "viciously" the Christian spiritualism of Einar Hjörleifsson Kvaran, an influential writer who had also been considered for the Nobel Prize.Einarsson, pp. 263–4
 "... with Salka Valka (1931–32) began the great series of sociological novels, often coloured with socialist ideas, continuing almost without a break for nearly twenty years. This was probably the most brilliant period of his career, and it is the one which produced those of his works that have become most famous. But Laxness never attached himself permanently to a particular dogma."Sveinn Hoskuldsson, "Scandinavica", 1972 supplement, pp. 1–2 
Salka Valka was published in English in 1936, receiving a glowing review from the Evening Standard: "No beauty is allowed to exist as ornamentation in its own right in these pages; but the work is replete from cover to cover with the beauty of its perfection."Guðmundsson, p.229
Halldór's next novel was Sjálfstætt fólk (Independent People, 1934, 1935) which was described by Jane Smiley as ".. one of the best books of the twentieth century." Jane Smiley, Independent People, Vintage International, 1997, cover
This was followed by Heimsljós (World Light, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940) described in the words of Magnus Magnusson as a book "... which has been consistently regarded by many critics as his most important work.".Magnus Magnusson, World Light, University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, 1969, p. viii
He also traveled to the Soviet Union and wrote approvingly of the Soviet system and culture.Guðmundsson, p.182

In 1946 Independent People was released as a Book of the Month Club selection in the United States, selling over 450,000 copies.Chay Lemoine (2007-02-09) HALLDÓR LAXNESS AND THE CIA.
In response to the establishment of a permanent US military base in Keflavík, he wrote the satire Atómstöðin (The Atom Station), an action which, in part, may have caused his blacklisting in the United States.Chay Lemoine (2010-11-18). The View from Here, No. 8. icenews.is "The demoralization of the occupation period is described... nowhere as dramatically as in Halldór Kiljan Laxness' Atómstöðin (1948)... he portrays postwar society in Reykjavík, completely torn from its moorings by the avalanche of foreign gold".Einarsson, p. 330 

==1950s==

In 1953 Laxness was awarded the Soviet-sponsored World Peace Council Literary Prize.Guðmundsson, p. 340
An adaptation of his novel Salka Valka was filmed by Sven Nykvist in 1954.Guðmundsson, p. 351
In 1955, Laxness was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, "for his vivid epic power which has renewed the great narrative art of Iceland": "His chief literary works belong to the genre... of narrative prose fiction. In the history of our literature Laxness is mentioned beside Snorri Sturluson and the author of the "Njals saga", and his place in world literature is among writers such as Cervantes, Zola, Tolstoy, and Hamsun... He is the most prolific and skillful essayist in Icelandic literature both old and new..." 
In the presentation address for the Nobel prize E. Wesen stated: "He is an excellent painter of Icelandic scenery and settings. Yet this is not what he has conceived of as his chief mission. 'Compassion is the source of the highest poetry. Compassion with Asta Sollilja on earth,' he says in one of his best books... And a social passion underlies everything Halldór Laxness has written. His personal championship of contemporary social and political questions is always very strong, sometimes so strong that it threatens to hamper the artistic side of his work. His safeguard then is the astringent humour which enables him to see even people he dislikes in a redeeming light, and which also permits him to gaze far down into the labyrinths of the human soul."Presentation address for the Nobel prize by E. Wesen, 1955 
In his acceptance speech for the Nobel prize he spoke of: "... the moral principles she grandmother instilled in me: never to harm a living creature; throughout my life, to place the poor, the humble, the meek of this world above all others; never to forget those who were slighted or neglected or who had suffered injustice, because it was they who, above all others, deserved our love and respect..."acceptance speech for the Nobel prize, 1955 
Laxness grew increasingly disenchanted with the Soviets after their military action in Hungary in 1956.Guðmundsson, p. 375
