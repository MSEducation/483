===Magnum, P.I.===

The 1981 to 1985 seasons of the CBS television program Magnum, P.I. were filmed in Honolulu during Anderson's mayoral leadership. The show unintentionally included background scenes that featured major construction and development projects on Oahu, promoted by Anderson as mayor.

===Perry and Price===

In 1983, KSSK-FM reformatted its morning programming pairing Michael W. Perry and Larry Price. To this day, Perry and Price continue to be two of the most popular personalities and one of the most popular radio news programs in Hawaii. Anderson was a regular listener and, a sign of Perry and Price's growing influence, was the first major person to call the show during the broadcast, in effect signaling how relevant they were to local culture and politics.[ref]

Anderson called the radio hosts, angry about their comments over a political issue. The Honolulu Star-Bulletin published the account on August 27, 1998:
Since Anderson's initial call, every Mayor of Honolulu and Governor of Hawaii has appeared on the morning Perry and Price program via telephone to comment or discuss various cultural and political issues and current events.

==Women in politics==

Interested in her role as first woman to become Mayor of Honolulu, the Hawaii Kai Sun Press asked Anderson to comment on women in politics. Published on June 1, 1983, Anderson said, "There is no way that we're going to change some of the discriminatory activities that go on toward women unless we do get them involved".
