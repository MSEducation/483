==House system==

Students of Waimea College are split into four houses named after four famous New Zealanders; they are Rutherford (Green), named after Ernest Rutherford; Sheppard (Blue), named after Kate Sheppard; Hillary (Yellow), named after Edmund Hillary; and Cooper (Red), named after Whina Cooper. Students are involved in various 'House competitions' throughout the year including the annual 'House Sports Day' event, in which students take part in a range of activities throughout the day in order to win points for their House as well as 'House Song', a competition involving each House performing a vocal presentation which is judged and awarded points. At the end of the school year, House points are tallied and the winning House gains the prize of 'House shield'.
