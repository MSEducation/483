Zeus is a wooden roller coaster located at Mt. Olympus Water & Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin.  The ride was built by Custom Coasters International and opened in 1997. The ride operates with a single train built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company that has five cars each with four seats.

==Ride Experience==

The coaster turns 180 degrees out of the station and ascends the 90 foot lift hill. A left hand turn and the ride drops 85 feet. A series of low airtime hills take the ride under the lift hill of the Hades roller coaster and out to the back of the park. A high speed turn around puts the track parallel to the first set of hills. More airtime hills and a right hand turn bring the train back to the station.
