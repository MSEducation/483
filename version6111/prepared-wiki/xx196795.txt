==="Bocor" remark===

Bung Mokhtar became known as the MP who uttered sexist comments in Parliament during the 11th Malaysian Parliament sitting on 9 May 2007. During a heated argument with Fong Po Kuan, the MP of Batu Gajah at that time, over ceiling leakages in the Parliament Houses, Bung Mokhtar, following Jasin MP at that time Mohammad Said bin Yusof, suggestively referenced menstruation in Malay:

Both Mohd Said and Bung Mokhtar's remark led to an uproar among women's groups, leading to their formal apology to all Malaysian women on 18 May 2007, following the script given by Sharizat Abdul Jalil, the Minister of Women, Family and Community Development at that time. But their apology was rejected by Fong Po Kuan because she found the apology not sincere, as they apologised under pressure.

Bung Mokhtar came into the spotlight again as early as the first day of the 12th Malaysian Parliament sitting on 30 April 2008 after being called the "Bigfoot of Kinabatangan" by Karpal Singh.
