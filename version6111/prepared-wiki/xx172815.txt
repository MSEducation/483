[[Kise stable]]

CATEGORIES: Sumo stables

[tpl]Nihongo|Kise stable|木瀬部屋|Kise-beya[/tpl] is a stable of sumo wrestlers, part of the Dewanoumi ichimon or group of stables. It was established in its current form in December 2003 by former maegashira Higonoumi, who branched off from Mihogaseki stable. The stable's first top division wrestler was Ichihara (later known as  Kiyoseumi), a former amateur champion, in January 2008. In May 2010 the Georgian Gagamaru earned promotion to the top division.
Following the demotion of Kise-oyakata in May 2010 after a scandal involving the selling of tournament tickets to members of the yakuza, Kise stable was dissolved with all 27 of its rikishi moving to the affiliated Kitanoumi stable.[tpl]cite web|title=Kise wrestlers to join Kitanoumi stable|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ss20100530a1.html|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=30 May 2010[/tpl] Kise was allowed to reestablish the stable in April 2012. All former members, as well as newcomers Jōkōryu and Sasanoyama, joined the reconstituted stable. As of April 2013 it had 31 wrestlers.

==History==

The original Kise stable (which had no connection to the current incarnation) was led by the chief referee Kimura Shonosuke and several other referees also took charge of it (a practice no longer permitted).[tpl]Cite book |author=Sharnoff, Lora |title=Grand Sumo|publisher=Weatherhill |year=1993 |id=ISBN 0-8348-0283-x[/tpl][/ref] Its ninth master was however a former wrestler (maegashira Katsuragawa), who re–established the stable in 1958. He resigned voluntarily from the Sumo Association in 1967 and his son-in-law, maegashira Kiyonomori retired from active competition and took over from him. Part of the Tatsunami ichimon, it was the only stable to allow amateurs as well as professionals to train in it, and it was also open to practitioners of other martial arts such as kendo. Kiyonomori led the stable until he reached the mandatory retirement age in 2000, at which point the stable folded, having produced no sekitori since the early 1980s.
