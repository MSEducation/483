The Museum of Transportation (initialised MOT, reporting mark MOTXRailinc, Search MARKs, accessed September 2009) of the St. Louis County, Missouri, United States Parks Department is a museum in the Greater St. Louis area. Founded in 1944 by a group of people who wanted to preserve the past and has a wide variety of vehicles, it has antique cars, boats, planes, and a sizable collection of locomotives and railroad equipment from around the United States.  A miniature train operates around a loop of track near the parking lot, and occasionally a full-size trolley is operated.

===Railroad===

The museum has its own railway spur to an active Union Pacific Railroad main line (formerly Missouri Pacific Railroad).  This has allowed the museum to take possession of large and unusual pieces of railroad equipment. Among them are:
At the corner of the property is Barrets Tunnel. Built in 1853, it was the first railroad tunnel built west of the Mississippi River and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.
The museum also operates a miniature railroad and a full-size trolley on a seasonal schedule.
