CATEGORIES: Androgens, Alcohols, Ketones

Mesterolone is an orally applicable androgen and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derivative. It is sold under the brand name Proviron (as Provironum in Asia-Pacific region), by Bayer Schering Pharma (earlier by Schering). In the late 70s and early 80s, it was used with some success in controlled studies of men suffering from various forms of depression. Mesterolone is a relatively weak androgen and rarely used for replacement therapies.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nieschlag E, Behre HM, Bouchard P, et al. |title=Testosterone replacement therapy: current trends and future directions |journal=Hum.

==Trials==

In one small scale clinical trial of depressed patients, an improvement of symptoms which included anxiety, lack of drive and desire was observed.[tpl]cite journal |author=Itil TM, Michael ST, Shapiro DM, Itil KZ |title=The effects of mesterolone, a male sex hormone in depressed patients (a double blind controlled study) |journal=Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=331–7 |date=June 1984 |pmid=6431212 [/tpl]  In patients with dysthymia, unipolar, and bipolar depression significant improvement was observed. In this series of studies, mesterolone lead to a significant decrease in LH and testosterone levels. In another study, 100 mg mesterolone cipionate was administered twice monthly. With regards to plasma T levels, there was no difference between the treated vs untreated group, and baseline LH levels were minimally affected.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kövary PM, Lenau H, Niermann H, Zierden E, Wagner H |title=Testosterone levels and gonadotrophins in Klinefelter's patients treated with injections of mesterolone cipionate |journal=Arch Dermatol Res |volume=258 |issue=3 |pages=289–94 |date=May 1977 |pmid=883846 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m4374818w9337427[/tpl]

==Bodybuilding==

Mesterolone had seen widespread use in bodybuilding primarily for antiestrogenic activity in anabolic steroid stacks  but such use has declined after introduction of aromatase inhibitors and SERMs. Most significant benefits of current Mesterolone use are considered by bodybuilders to be maintaining libido off-cycle and also relatively and temporarily improving vascularity.Meso-RX Steroid Profiles - Proviron (Mesterolone)
