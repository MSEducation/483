[[Avro 527]]

The Avro 527 was the last Avro two-seat fighter derivative of the basic 504 design. It was built early in 1916 for trial by the Royal Flying Corps, with the features of the RNAS Avro 504G but with a much more powerful engine; it did not reach production.

==Design and development==

The RNAS Avro 504G was an  80 hp (60 kW)  Gnome rotary-engined version of the Avro 504B with forward firing Vickers guns and a Scarff-ring mounted Lewis gun in the rear cockpit.[tpl]Harvnb|Jackson|1965|page =62[/tpl]  The Avro 527[tpl]Harvnb|Jackson|1965|page =90[/tpl] was a version of the 504G intended for the RFC with the much more powerful, 150 hp (112 hp)  Sunbeam Nubian water-cooled engine. It used standard 504K wings and central skid, single axle undercarriage.  Naval 504s had mostly been fitted with a vertical tail with a generous fixed fin, in contrast to RFC machines with the all moving, comma shaped rudder, and the 527 retained the fin from its 504G predecessor.  The engine installation was very different from other 504s, though similar to that of the Avro 519 which used the same engine.   There were two tall, almost vertical exhaust pipes, one from each bank of the upright V-eight Nubian, discharging just above the upper wing.  Its radiator was mounted edge on (longitudinally) between the wings on the starboard side.
The 527 first flew sometime in 1916.  A version with wings of 6 ft (1.83 m) span was considered, the 527A, but there is no record of it flying.

==Operational history==

When trialled by the RFC, pilots found that it did not climb well and that their view was obscured by the large engine, its radiator and exhausts. As a result, production was discontinued and only one aircraft was ever built.
