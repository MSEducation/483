[[Flexible AC transmission system]]

CATEGORIES: Electric power transmission, Electrical engineering

A flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) is a system composed of static equipment used for the AC transmission of electrical energy. It is meant to enhance controllability and increase power transfer capability of the network. It is generally a power electronics-based system.
FACTS is defined by the IEEE as "a power electronic based system and other static equipment that provide control of one or more AC transmission system parameters to enhance controllability and increase power transfer capability."Proposed terms and definitions for flexible AC transmission system(FACTS), IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, Volume 12, Issue 4, October 1997, pp. 1848–1853. doi: 10.1109/61.634216

===History===

The first FACTS installation was at the C. J. Slatt Substation in Northern region.  This is a 500 kV, 3-phase 60 Hz substation, and was developed by EPRI, the Bonneville Power Administration and General Electric Company.Electrical Machines, Drives and Power Systems, 6th Edition, p. 820 

===Series compensation===

In series compensation, the FACTS is connected in series with the power system. It works as a controllable voltage source.  Series inductance exists in all AC transmission lines.  On long lines, when a large current flows, this causes a large voltage drop. To compensate, series capacitors are connected, decreasing the effect of the inductance.

===Shunt compensation===

In shunt compensation, power system is connected in shunt (parallel) with the FACTS. It works as a controllable current source.  Shunt compensation is of two types:

==Theory==

In the case of a no-loss line, voltage magnitude at the receiving end is the same as voltage magnitude at the sending end: Vs = Vr=V.
As it is a no-loss line, active power P is the same at any point of the line:
Reactive power at sending end is the opposite of reactive power at receiving end:

===Series compensation===

FACTS for series compensation modify line impedance: X is decreased so as to increase the transmittable active power. However, more reactive power must be provided.

===Shunt compensation===

Reactive current is injected into the line to maintain voltage magnitude. Transmittable active power is increased but more reactive power is to be provided.
