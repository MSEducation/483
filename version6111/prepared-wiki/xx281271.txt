==Early life and education==

Popkin was born in 1944 and grew up in Superior, Wisconsin; neither of his parents had a college education. Popkin describes the food he ate in Superior as "...typical of the way most Americans handled food in the first half of the 20th century." He attended the University of Wisconsin, graduating in 1967, after which he spent one year doing graduate work at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1968, he returned to the University of Wisconsin, and received his MS from there one year later. In 1974, he received his PhD in agricultural economics from Cornell University.

==Career==

From 1971 to 1972 Popkin worked as a research economist at the Institute for Research in Poverty at the University of Wisconsin. From 1974 to 1976 Popkin was a visiting associate professor with the Rockefeller Foundation in Manila, Philippines. He joined UNC-Chapel Hill's faculty in 1977 and became the W.R. Kenan Jr. Distinguished Professor of Nutrition there in 2011.Popkin named Kenan Professor

==Research and views==

Popkin was a co-author on a widely cited 2004 paper in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition which argued that high fructose corn syrup-containing beverages may uniquely contribute to obesity.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Bray |first1=George A. |last2= Nielsen |first2=Samara Joy |year=2004 |title=Consumption of high-fructose corn syrup in beverages may play a role in the epidemic of obesity |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=537–543 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/79/4/537.short |accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-12-08-fructose-corn-syrup_N.htm | title=New data: High-fructose corn syrup no worse than sugar | work=USA Today | date=8 December 2008 | accessdate=29 December 2013 | author=Weise, Elizabeth[/tpl] More recently, however, he has argued that smoothies are "the new danger" due to the large quantities of fructose they contain.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/07/smoothies-fruit-juices-new-health-risk | title=Smoothies and fruit juices are a new risk to health, US scientists warn | publisher=The Guardian | date=6 September 2013 | accessdate=18 September 2013 | author=Boseley, Sarah[/tpl] Popkin has also published research on risk factors for obesity, which, he has concluded, include fat intake.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/68/6/1157.short | title=Dietary fat intake does affect obesity! | author=Bray, GA; Popkin, BM | journal=Am J Clin Nutr |date=December 1998 | volume=68 | issue=6 | pages=1157–1173[/tpl] He has also published studies about increasing portion sizes.[tpl]cite doi|10.1001/jama.289.4.450[/tpl] In his research, he shows how increasing access to media and exposure to advertising, a powerful food industry, the rise of Wal-Mart like shopping centers, and a dramatic decline in physical activity are clashing with millions of years of human evolution, creating a world of overweight people with debilitating health problems such as diabetes. Ultimately, Popkin contends that widespread obesity is less a result of poor individual dietary choices than about a hi-tech, interconnected world in which governments and multinational corporations have extraordinary power to shape our everyday lives.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.unctv.org/content/barry-popkin | title=Barry Popkin | publisher=UNC-TV | accessdate=9 August 2013[/tpl] Popkin also conducted the China Health and Nutrition Survey, and has conducted other surveys in countries such as Russia, Kyrgyzstan, and the United Arab Emirates.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/nutrans/popkin | title=Barry Popkin PhD | publisher=University of North Carolina Chapel Hill | accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl] In addition, he is a co-author of a number of the American Heart Association's official statements.[tpl]cite pmid|22907934[/tpl] He has brought more than $60 million in grants to UNC-Chapel Hill, and he is currently leading a project whose goal is to determine the calorie and nutrient content of popular foods in the United States, or, as Popkin describes it, "mapping the food genome."[tpl]cite web | url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/what-do-we-eat-new-food-map-will-tell-us | title=WHAT DO WE EAT?

Just because children who eat more fast food are the most likely to become obese does not prove that calories from fast foods bear the brunt of the blame.”[tpl]cite web | url=http://wschronicle.com/2014/01/fast-food-only-part-of-the-problem/ | title=Fast Food Only Part of the Problem | work=Winston-Salem Chronicle | date=23 January 2014 | accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]

==Nutrition Transition==

The concept of nutrition transition, referring to the changes in diet in the Western world from high-fiber diets to those based on more processed foods containing more fat and sugar, was first proposed by Popkin in 1993.Nutritional Patterns and Transitions In addition to this, Popkin attributes much of the rise in obesity rates to people being physically inactive more than was previously the case. Since he proposed the concept, Popkin has published studies about the nutrition transition and its effects in the developing world,[tpl]cite journal | url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/131/3/871S.short | title=The Nutrition Transition and Obesity in the Developing World | author=Popkin, Barry M. | journal=Journal of Nutrition |date=March 2001 | volume=131 | issue=3 | pages=871–3S[/tpl] as well as in Brazil.[tpl]cite pmid|7743983[/tpl]
