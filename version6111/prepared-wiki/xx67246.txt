The Afghan Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Program (DDR) was established by the government of Afghanistan to disarm 90,000 former combatants and integrate them into civilian life.
The Canadian Government has said that the mission was completed on July 2005, although only 50,000 soldiers have been captured and integrated into civilian life. There are still an estimated 40,000 soldiers who are loyal to General Muhamod Fahim.
The first phase of the operation began July 1, 2003 and focused on Kunduz Province, Bamyan Province, and Khost Province.
The deputy chairman of the commission responsible for the disarmament program is Afghan Urban Development Minister Yousuf Pushtun. 
The senior DDR advisor from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) is Sultan Aziz.
The total budget for the DDR process is estimated at US$200 million, of which only $41 million had been secured by phase one, including $35 million from the Japanese government.
