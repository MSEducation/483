==History==

The locality of Usme was founded in 1650 as "San Pedro de Usme" which became a center for the rural areas nearby dedicated to agricultural activities. These supplied food to Bogotá. It was named after San Pedro (Saint Peter) and Usme after the name "Usminia" a female Native American. In 1911 became a municipality of Cundinamarca with the name of Usme and became known for its constant problems between landlords, tenants and peasant workers for the land. During the mid 20th century an agrarian reform finally arranged the land. The area then shifted from an agricultural production to industrial materials production mainly for construction, giving way to  quarries. In 1972, Usme is assigned to Bogotá's district as one of its localities.
