==History==

John Bidwell (1819 – 1900) was born in Chautauqua County, New York, and led the Bartleson-Bidwell Party to California in 1841.  John Sutter employed Bidwell as his business manager shortly after Bidwell's arrival in California.  Bidwell obtained the two square league Mexican land grant in 1845.
Colonel Charles D. Semple arrived in California in 1849.  Semple's brother, Dr. Robert B. Semple, was president of the 1849 California Constitutional Convention and co-owner of the adjacent Rancho Jimeno. Charles D. Semple bought Rancho Colus from Bidwell in 1850.[tpl]cite book |last=Hoover |first=Mildred B. |authorlink= |coauthors=Hero & Ethel Rensch, and William N.

With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.  As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Colus was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852, but was rejected as the Land Commission considered the grant boundaries were undefined.United States.
