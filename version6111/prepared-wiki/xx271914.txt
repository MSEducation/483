===June===

Australian airmen were involved in Allied efforts to delay German reinforcements from reaching Normandy throughout June. On the night of 6/7 June, 20 Mosquitos from No. 464 Squadron were dispatched to attack German road convoys and trains in northern France.Herington (1963), pp. 127–128 The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons also participated in raids on French towns on this night. While No. 463, No. 466 and No. 467 Squadrons mainly targeted railway facilities, No. 460 Squadron formed part of an attack on Vire which sought to destroy the town in order to prevent the Germans from using the roads which passed through it.Herington (1963), p. 131 Following these initial raids, Bomber Command continued to target railway infrastructure in France in an attempt to disrupt the movement of German reinforcements to Normandy.Herington (1963), pp. 131–132 The command operated intensively during the week after the invasion, and some Australian aircrew flew raids on consecutive nights during this period.Herington (1963), pp. 133–134 Overall, Bomber Command made 16 raids against railway facilities in France between 13 and 30 June, of which six included at least one of the RAAF squadrons.Herington (1963), p. 158 The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF units also took part in several attacks on German supply dumps and airfields during this period. Bomber Command made fewer raids on these targets than had been planned prior to the invasion, however, as its units were frequently assigned to strike facilities associated with the German V-1 flying bombs which were attacking the UK.Herington (1963), pp. 135–136, 161 No. 464 Squadron also operated against German vehicles travelling at night and bombed railway yards, and flew 75 sorties between the nights of 7/8 and 12/13 June.Herington (1963), p. 143 Overall, the squadron conducted attacks on 19 nights during June, during which five of its aircraft were destroyed.Lax and Kane-Maguire (1999), pp. 156–157 The Australians in 2TAF's other light and medium bomber units also attacked the German lines of communication in France and occasionally provided direct support for the Allied ground forces throughout this period.Herington (1963), p. 142
During June, Australians also contributed to the defence of the Allied beachhead against German air and naval attacks. No. 453 Squadron and the RAAF fighter pilots in RAF units continued to fly patrols over the beachhead in the week after D-Day, but only rarely encountered German aircraft.Herington (1963), pp. 137–138 From 11 June the Australian squadron's aircraft frequently operated from airfields which had been built at Normandy, and on the 25th of the month it and the other units of No. 125 Wing moved from the UK to Advanced Landing Ground B11 within the beachhead near Longues-sur-Mer.RAAF Historical Section (1995), Volume 2 Fighter Units, p. 128Bennett (1994), p. 113 By late June, No. 453 Squadron and the other RAF Spitfire units were regularly attacking German positions in Normandy as well as providing air defence for the Allied forces in the area; during the month the squadron flew more than 700 sorties.Herington (1963), p. 164 A small number of Australians posted to RAF squadrons equipped with Hawker Typhoon fighter-bombers also attacked German vehicles and positions in direct support of the Allied ground troops throughout the month.Herington (1963), pp. 165–166 No. 456 Squadron, which was one of four night fighter squadrons assigned to protect the beachhead, frequently met German aircraft and shot down twelve of them in the week after the landing.Herington (1963), pp. 138–139Long (1973), p. 380 Australian fighter ace Flight Lieutenant Nicky Barr, who had escaped from German custody in Italy during 1943, also briefly served in an air support control unit in Normandy. Barr landed at Omaha Beach on 9 June, but returned to the UK three days later as his commanding officer believed that German forces would execute Barr if they recaptured him.Dornan (2002), pp. 226–229[tpl]cite news|title=Wing Commander Nicky Barr|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1521727/Wing-Commander-Nicky-Barr.html|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=20 June 2006[/tpl]
German submarines and surface warships sortied to attack the Allied invasion fleet, and the Australian members of Coastal Command participated in attacks on these vessels. The two RAAF flying boat squadrons operated intensively throughout June, but did not sink any German ships or submarines.Herington (1963), pp. 151–153 The aircrew of two of the British B-24 Liberators which sank German submarines during this period included Australian personnel, however, and Australians were on board several of the other RAF aircraft which flew anti-submarine and anti-shipping patrols. In addition, No. 455 Squadron took part in several attacks on E-boats operating near Normandy as well as German shipping travelling through the English Channel.Herington (1963), pp. 144–147, 155 No. 460 Squadron and Australians in other Bomber Command units also participated in raids on E-Boat bases at Le Havre and Boulogne on the nights of 14/15 June and 15/16 June respectively.Herington (1963), pp. 154–155

===July and August===

By July the Allied armies were having difficulty advancing against the German forces in Normandy. In an attempt to create a breakthrough, the Allied air commanders decided to use heavy bombers to attack German positions.Long (1973), p. 383 The first of these attacks was made on 7 July by 467 Bomber Command aircraft and targeted German forces near Caen, as well as the city itself. The Australian contribution to this raid included 20 Lancasters from No. 460 Squadron and 14 Halifaxes from No. 466 Squadron as well as aircrew in RAF units. One of No. 460 Squadron's aircraft made a crash landing within the Allied beachhead after being damaged by German anti-aircraft guns, but its crew survived and were evacuated to the UK. While the attack devastated Caen, the ground troops were only able to capture the northern half of the city when they advanced on 8 July.Herington (1963), pp. 226–227 All four Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in a series of attacks on German positions on 18 July as part of Operation Goodwood, but this offensive also failed to result in a breakthrough. On 30 July, No. 463, No. 466 and No. 467 Squadrons contributed aircraft to another major bombardment of German positions near Caumont ahead of Operation Bluecoat; 693 heavy bombers took part in this attack, of which 39 were from the Australian squadrons, but many did not drop their bombs as cloud obscured the aiming markers in the target area.Herington (1963), p. 231 All four Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in the next major attack, which took place on the night of 7/8 August to support Operation Totalize, but cloud and smoke again prevented many of the bombers from attacking the target area.Herington (1963), p. 232 The four squadrons also attacked German Army positions on 14 August in support of Operation Tractable; visibility was clear over most of the target area, and the raids were considered successful.Herington (1963), p. 233 By this time the Allied armies had successfully broken out of Normandy, and no further heavy bomber attacks were required.Herington (1963), p. 234
Australians also continued to be involved in the Allied air attacks which sought to disrupt the movement of German troops and supplies to Normandy during July and August. As well as supporting the ground forces in Normandy and continuing to bomb V-1 flying bomb launch facilities in northern France, Bomber Command attacked railway facilities in France during July and August, and at least one of the Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in 15 of the 25 raids conducted against these targets.Herington (1963), p. 235Long (1973), p. 380–382 No. 464 Squadron also flew more than 350 sorties during July and 400 in August against transport infrastructure in France and convoys of German vehicles. These operations, which were generally conducted at night, cost the unit three aircraft.Herington (1963), pp. 240–241 The only interruption to No. 464 Squadron's attacks on transportation came on the night of 14/15 July, when four aircraft piloted by highly experienced airmen conducted a successful precision strike on the Gestapo barracks at Bonneuil-Matours.Herington (1963), p. 241 Australian aircrew assigned to other 2TAF medium bomber and fighter-bomber units also participated in attacks on bridges and railways throughout July.Herington (1963), pp. 239–240
No. 453 Squadron operated from Normandy during July and August, and mainly patrolled behind the German front line in search of motor transport to attack. It occasionally encountered German aircraft during this period and shot down several Me 109 and Fw 190 fighters. The squadron flew 727 sorties during July, but lost several of its Spitfires to German anti-aircraft guns. No. 453 Squadron continued to operate against German transport during August, and moved to an airfield near Lingèvres on the 13th of the month. This airfield was attacked by a German aircraft the next day, resulting in the death of one Australian pilot and another three wounded. The squadron experienced considerable success during the Allied break-out, and claimed to have destroyed a large number of German vehicles during August.Herington (1963), pp. 241–243 Overall, No. 453 Squadron flew more than 1,300 combat sorties during July and August.Herington (1963), p. 189 While No. 456 Squadron's night fighters conducted patrols over Normandy in early July and shot down four German bombers on the 5th of the month,  the unit—in common with almost all the Mosquito-equipped night fighter squadrons stationed in the UK—was tasked with intercepting V-1 flying bombs from 6 July onwards.Herington (1963), p. 249Bennett (1995), p. 144
The Australian flying boat squadrons assigned to Coastal Command also continued to support the invasion during July and August. On 8 July a No. 10 Squadron Sunderland sank the German submarine U-243 [tpl]convert|130|mi|km[/tpl] south-west of Brest.Long (1973), p. 384 Overall, No. 10 Squadron flew 56 patrols during July and No. 461 Squadron conducted 67, most of which were made at night.Herington (1963), pp. 244–245 One of No. 461 Squadron's Sunderlands damaged the submarine U-385 [tpl]convert|150|mi|km[/tpl] south of Brest on 10 August, and it was sunk the next day by [tpl]HMS|Starling|U66|6[/tpl]. On 13 August another No. 461 Squadron Sunderland attacked and sank U-270. No. 10 Squadron flew almost as many patrols throughout August as it had during July, but did not encounter any submarines.Herington (1963), pp. 245–246 No. 455 Squadron took part in attacks on German shipping travelling off Holland and in the North Sea during July and August, but these operations were not directly related to supporting the invasion.Herington (1963), pp. 246–249

==Aftermath==

RAAF personnel also participated in the Allied invasion of southern France (Operation Dragoon) during August 1944. No. 458 Squadron, which was  equipped with Wellington bombers, flew anti-submarine patrols and attacked targets in northern Italy and southern France ahead of the landings, which took place on the 15th of the month. The squadron continued these duties until the end of August.RAAF Historical Section (1995), Volume 4 Maritime and Transport Units, p. 102 The Spitfire-equipped No. 451 Squadron escorted Allied invasion convoys on 14 August and patrolled over the Allied beachhead as troops came ashore the next day. From 25 August the squadron was based at an airfield near Cuers in France and provided air defence for the region until October. Few German aircraft were encountered throughout this period, however.RAAF Historical Section (1995), Volume 2 Fighter Units, pp. 114–115
The low casualties incurred by the Commonwealth air forces during the Battle of Normandy led to an over-supply of trained aircrew. While the number of pilots and other airmen undergoing training through the EATS had begun to be reduced in early 1944, by 30 June there were thousands of qualified airmen—including 3,000 Australians—in the UK waiting to be posted to an operational unit. This number greatly exceeded the requirements of the Allied air forces. Accordingly, the flow of airmen from EATS training facilities in Canada to the UK was greatly cut back, and Australia ceased sending airmen overseas for training under the scheme in August. While 1,245 Australian airmen arrived in the UK during the last six months of 1944 (a reduction from the 5,181 who had arrived in the first six months of the year), only those who were qualified as air gunners were typically ever assigned to combat units. It was not possible to find flying positions for most of the remaining unattached airmen who arrived after June 1944, and some were posted back to Australia; the remainder spent the rest of the war in training courses and various non-flying roles.Herington (1963), pp. 283–285, 287
Australian military personnel in Europe remained in action until the end of the war. At the time of the German surrender in May 1945, there were 15,500 members of the RAAF in the UK and western Europe, of whom 12,300 were qualified aircrew.Long (1973), p. 392Herington (1963), p. 462 Most members of the small party of Australian Army officers who had been posted to the UK ahead of D-Day also remained in Europe until the end of the war.

==Commemoration==

A total of 44 Australians are buried in Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries in the Normandy region. These include men killed in the region prior to the invasion and those who died during the fighting in 1944. Of the Australian graves, 17 are located at the Bayeux War Cemetery, six at Saint-Désir de Lisieux, five at Banneville-la-Campagne, four at the Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, three at both Douvres la Délivrande and Hermanville-sur-Mer and one each at Ranville, Ryes-Nazenville, Saint-Manvieu-Norrey and Tilly-sur-Seulles. The Bayeux Memorial, which lists the names of Commonwealth personnel killed in Normandy with no known grave, does not include any Australians.Lecouturier (2011), pp. 136–137 The most recent burial of an Australian serviceman in Normandy took place in April 2011 when No. 453 Squadron pilot Flight Lieutenant Henry Lacy Smith was interred at Ranville War Cemetery. Smith drowned when his Spitfire crash-landed in the River Orne on 11 June 1944, but his body was not recovered until November 2010.[tpl]cite news|title=WWII pilot to be buried 66 years on|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-04-16/wwii-pilot-to-be-buried-66-years-on/2613086|accessdate=27 November 2011|newspaper=ABC News|date=27 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Dougherty|first=Tom|title=Spitfire hero Flight Lieutenant Henry Lacy Smith buried 66 years on|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/spitfire-hero-flight-lieutenant-henry-lacy-smith-buried-66-years-on/story-e6frea8c-1226041725311|accessdate=27 November 2011|newspaper=AdelaideNow|date=20 April 2011[/tpl]
Australia's involvement in the Battle of Normandy has also been commemorated through memorials and official state visits. "Normandy" is one of the 47 battle sites recorded on the Australian War Memorial, London, which was dedicated in 2003.Office of Australian War Graves (2003), p. 11 In 2004, Australian Prime Minister John Howard attended the ceremonies in France that marked the 60th anniversary of the Normandy invasion.[tpl]cite news|last=Barker|first=Geoffrey|title=Howard opens up election beachhead|newspaper=The Australian Financial Review|date=7 June 2004|page=4[/tpl] The French Government also awarded the Legion of Honour to ten of the surviving Australian veterans of the landings to commemorate this anniversary. When the Mémorial de Caen opened in 1988, the flagpoles outside the museum commemorating the countries which participated in the battle did not include an Australian flag. Former No. 453 Squadron fighter pilot Colin Leith campaigned to have an Australian flag added, and this was achieved on 1 May 1998.[tpl]cite news|last=Barratt|first=Paul|title=Pilot fought for the flag at Normandy|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/pilot-fought-for-the-flag-at-normandy-20100423-tjbt.html|accessdate=27 November 2011|newspaper=The Age|date=24 April 2010[/tpl]
