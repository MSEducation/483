CATEGORIES: Climate, Basic meteorological concepts and phenomena

Climate is a measure of the average pattern of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate is different from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.
A region's climate is generated by the climate system, which has five components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, land surface, and biosphere.AR4 SYR Synthesis Report Annexes. Ipcc.ch. Retrieved on 2011-06-28.
The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents. Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was originally developed by Wladimir Köppen. The Thornthwaite system,[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.2307/210739|url=http://www.unc.edu/courses/2007fall/geog/801/001/www/ET/Thornthwaite48-GeogrRev.pdf|author=C. W. Thornthwaite|title=An Approach Toward a Rational Classification of Climate|journal=Geographical Review|volume=38|issue=1|pages=55–94|year=1948|jstor=210739[/tpl] in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying animal species diversity and potential effects of climate changes. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region.
Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. Climate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in global warming.

==Definition==

Climate (from Ancient Greek klima, meaning inclination) is commonly defined as the weather averaged over a long period.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title = Climate|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = American Meteorological Society|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=climate1|accessdate = 2008-05-14[/tpl] The standard averaging period is 30 years,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages |title= Climate averages |accessdate=2008-05-17 |publisher= Met Office[/tpl] but other periods may be used depending on the purpose. Climate also includes statistics other than the average, such as the magnitudes of day-to-day or year-to-year variations. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) glossary definition is as follows:
The difference between climate and weather is usefully summarized by the popular phrase "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get."National Weather Service Office Tucson, Arizona. Main page. Retrieved on 2007-06-01. Over historical time spans there are a number of nearly constant variables that determine climate, including latitude, altitude, proportion of land to water, and proximity to oceans and mountains. These change only over periods of millions of years due to processes such as plate tectonics. Other climate determinants are more dynamic: the thermohaline circulation of the ocean leads to a 5 °C (9 °F) warming of the northern Atlantic Ocean compared to other ocean basins.Stefan Rahmstorf The Thermohaline Ocean Circulation: A Brief Fact Sheet.

Alterations in the quantity of atmospheric greenhouse gases determines the amount of solar energy retained by the planet, leading to global warming or global cooling. The variables which determine climate are numerous and the interactions complex, but there is general agreement that the broad outlines are understood, at least insofar as the determinants of historical climate change are concerned.[tpl]cite journal|author = Ledley, T.S.|year = 1999|title = Climate change and greenhouse gases|journal = EOS|volume = 80|issue = 39|page = 453|url = http://www.agu.org/eos_elec/99148e.html|accessdate = 2008-05-17|doi = 10.1029/99EO00325|last2 = Sundquist|first2 = E.

==Climate classification==

There are several ways to classify climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes were defined in Ancient Greece to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empiric methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empiric classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness,United States National Arboretum. USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map.

A common shortcoming of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.

===Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic===

The simplest classification is that involving air masses. The Bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its moisture properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for tropical, P for polar, A for Arctic or Antarctic, M for monsoon, E for equatorial, and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate the stability of the atmosphere. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title = Airmass Classification|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = American Meteorological Society|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=airmass-classification1|accessdate = 2008-05-22[/tpl] While air mass identification was originally used in weather forecasting during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.[tpl]cite journal|author = Schwartz, M.D.|year = 1995|title = Detecting Structural Climate Change: An Air Mass-Based Approach in the North Central United States, 1958–1992|journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume = 85|issue = 3|pages = 553–568|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8306.1995.tb01812.x[/tpl]
Based upon the Bergeron classification scheme is the Spatial Synoptic Classification system (SSC).  There are six categories within the SSC scheme: Dry Polar (similar to continental polar), Dry Moderate (similar to maritime superior), Dry Tropical (similar to continental tropical), Moist Polar (similar to maritime polar), Moist Moderate (a hybrid between maritime polar and maritime tropical), and Moist Tropical (similar to maritime tropical, maritime monsoon, or maritime equatorial).Robert E.

===Köppen===

The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. These primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, polar ice cap, and desert.

A polar ice cap, or polar ice sheet, is a high-latitude region of a planet or moon that is covered in ice. Ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy as solar radiation from the sun than equatorial regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures.Michael Ritter. Ice Cap Climate.

==Record==

===Modern===

Details of the modern climate record are known through the taking of measurements from such weather instruments as thermometers, barometers, and anemometers during the past few centuries. The instruments used to study weather over the modern time scale, their known error, their immediate environment, and their exposure have changed over the years, which must be considered when studying the climate of centuries past.Spencer Weart. The Modern Temperature Trend. Retrieved on 2007-06-01.

===Paleoclimatology===

Paleoclimatology is the study of past climate over a great period of the Earth's history. It uses evidence from ice sheets, tree rings, sediments, coral, and rocks to determine the past state of the climate. It demonstrates periods of stability and periods of change and can indicate whether changes follow patterns such as regular cycles.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA Paleoclimatology. Retrieved on 2007-06-01.

==Climate change==

Climate change is the variation in global or regional climates over time. It reflects changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes can be caused by processes internal to the Earth, external forces (e.g. variations in sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.Arctic Climatology and Meteorology. Climate change. Retrieved on 2008-05-19.
In recent usage, especially in the context of environmental policy, the term "climate change" often refers only to changes in modern climate, including the rise in average surface temperature known as global warming. In some cases, the term is also used with a presumption of human causation, as in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC uses "climate variability" for non-human caused variations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/518.htm |title=Glossary |work=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

Earth has undergone periodic climate shifts in the past, including four major ice ages. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial. Suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of the continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.Illinois State Museum (2002). Ice Ages.

===Climate models===

Climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere,Eric Maisonnave. Climate Variability. Retrieved on 2008-05-02. [tpl]Wayback|url=http://www.cerfacs.fr/globc/research/variability/|date =20080610145233|bot=DASHBot[/tpl] oceans, land surface and ice. They are used for a variety of purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.
The most talked-about applications of these models in recent years have been their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide (see greenhouse gas). These models predict an upward trend in the global mean surface temperature, with the most rapid increase in temperature being projected for the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.
Models can range from relatively simple to quite complex:
Climate forecasting is a way by some scientists are using to predict climate change. In 1997 the prediction division of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University began generating seasonal climate forecasts on a real-time basis. To produce these forecasts an extensive suite of forecasting tools was developed, including a multimodel ensemble approach that required thorough validation of each model's accuracy level in simulating interannual climate variability.http://portal.iri.columbia.edu/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_2476_580_1063_43/http%3B/iriportal3.ldeo.columbia.edu%3B7087/publishedcontent/publish/development/climate_activities/prediction/climate_forecasts/climate_forecasts_overview__introduction/cf_intro_learn_more.html
