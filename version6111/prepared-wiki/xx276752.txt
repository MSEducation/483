Colloid nodules are the most common kind of thyroid nodule.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2003/0201/p559.html |title=Thyroid Nodules |date=1 February 2003|publisher=medicalonly.com |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl]

==Presentation==

Colloid nodules are usually small enough to be undetectable without an ultrasound or other imaging techniques.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.medicalonly.com/2007/06/21/thyroid_growths |title=The Truth About Thyroid Growths: Origins, Symptoms, and Outcomes |date=21 June 2007|publisher=American Academy of Family Physicians |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl] They usually produce no symptoms, so patients are unlikely to notice them until their size makes them easier to detect. Like other thyroid nodules, they are usually first noticed in a routine physical examination.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007265.htm |title=Thyroid nodule |date=19 April 2010|publisher=Medline Plus |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

Colloid nodules may be initially identified as an unspecified kind of thyroid nodule. Follow-up examinations typically include an ultrasound if it's unclear whether or not there really is a nodule present. Once the presence of a nodule has been confirmed, the determination of the kind of thyroid nodule is done by fine needle aspiration biopsy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thyroidmanager.org/chapter%206d/fnabiopsy-frame.htm |title=Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy of the Thyroid Gland, Chapter 6d.  |author=Diana S.

Colloid nodules are distinguished by an apparently gelatinous mass of colloid both surrounding and contained within follicular cells. Colloid nodules are not surrounded by a fibrous capsule of compressed tissue. However, they are surrounded by flattened epithelial cells.[tpl]cite web |url=http://rcpa.tv/parts/educational/anatomical/Dr_Alpha_Tsui/Thyroid_cytology.pdf |title=Thyroid cytology |author=Dr. Alpha Tsui |date=10 October 2010 |publisher=thyroidmanager.org |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl] Both the number of cells and the type of colloid may vary considerably.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thyroidmanager.org/chapter%206d/fnabiopsy-frame.htm |title=Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy of the Thyroid Gland, Chapter 6d.  |author=Diana S.
