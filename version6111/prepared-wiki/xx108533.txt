Chris Broach (b. Christopher Robert Broach September 5, 1976 in Madison, WI) is one of the guitarists/vocalists in the 90's Emo band Braid.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p211335/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Biography: Braid|last=Frey|first=Tracy |publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl] In August 1994, just before starting his freshman year at the University of Illinois (Champaign/Urbana), Broach went to see Braid play a show at The Red Herring, in Urbana, Illinois. After the show, he was introduced to Bob Nanna through a mutual friend.  Broach was then introduced to Roy Ewing, the drummer of Braid, and spoke to him at length.  By the end of the show, Ewing was walking around introducing Broach to friends as 'the newest member of the band,' much to the surprise of Broach. A couple of tryouts later, and a line-up change in which Broach replaced Pete Havranek on guitar,  Broach became an official member of Braid, recording his guitar parts on the first 7-inch the band ever released a week later.Grubbs, 2008, p. 135-138
