==Eligibility==

===Eligibility requirements===

No person is eligible to be President unless that person is a "natural-born citizen", is at least thirty-five years old, and has been a resident within the United States for at least fourteen years.  These eligibility requirements are specified both in the U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 1, Clause 5, and in the Presidential Succession Act ([tpl]uscsub|3|19|e[/tpl]).

===Acting officers===

Acting officers may be eligible. In 2009, the Continuity of Government Commission, a private non-partisan think tank, reported,

==Motivation for changes to the succession in 1945==

Two months after succeeding Franklin D. Roosevelt, President Harry S. Truman proposed that the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate be granted priority in the line of succession over the Cabinet so as to ensure the President would not be able to appoint his successor to the Presidency."Special Message to the Congress on the Succession to the Presidency. June 19, 1945" by President Harry S. Truman; from the American Presidency Project archives
The Secretary of State and the other Cabinet officials are appointed by the President, while the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate are elected officials. The Speaker is chosen by the U.S. House of Representatives, and every Speaker has been a member of that body for the duration of their term as Speaker; the President pro tempore is chosen by the U.S. Senate and by custom the Senator of the majority party with the longest record of continuous service fills this position. The Congress approved this change and inserted the Speaker and the President pro tempore in line, ahead of the members of the Cabinet in the order in which their positions were established.
In his speech supporting the changes, Truman noted that the House is more likely to be in political agreement with the President and Vice President than the Senate. The succession of a Republican to a Democratic Presidency would further complicate an already unstable political situation. However, when the changes to the succession were signed into law, they placed Republican House Speaker Joseph W. Martin first in the line of succession after the Vice President.
Some of Truman's critics said that his ordering of the Speaker before the President pro tempore was motivated by his dislike of the then-current holder of the latter rank, Senator Kenneth McKellar.Kipnotes.com Further motivation may have been provided by Truman's preference for House Speaker Sam Rayburn to be next in the line of succession, rather than Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius, Jr.

==Constitutional foundation==

The line of succession is mentioned in three places in the Constitution: in Article II, Section 1, in Section 3 of the 20th Amendment, and in the 25th Amendment.

==Acting President and President==

Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution provides that:
This originally left open the question whether "the same" refers to "the said office" or only "the powers and duties of the said office".  Some historians, including Edward Corwin and John D. Feerick, have argued that the framers' intention was that the Vice President would remain Vice President while executing the powers and duties of the presidency; however, there is also much evidence to the contrary, the most compelling of which is Article I, section 3, of the Constitution itself, the relevant text of which reads:
This text appears to answer the hypothetical question of whether the office or merely the powers of the presidency devolved upon the Vice President on his succession. Thus, the 25th Amendment merely restates and reaffirms the validity of existing precedent, apart from adding valuable new protocols for presidential disability. Not everyone agreed with this interpretation when it was first put to the test, and it was left to John Tyler, the first presidential successor in U.S. history, to establish the precedent that was respected in the absence of the 25th Amendment.
Upon the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, after a brief hesitation, Vice President John Tyler took the position that he was President, and not merely acting President, upon taking the presidential oath of office. However, some contemporaries—including John Quincy Adams,[tpl]cite journal |last=Schlesinger |first=Arthur M., Jr. |title=On the Presidential Succession |journal=Political Science Quarterly |date=Autumn 1974 |year=89 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=475, 495–496 |jstor=2148451[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Rankin |first=Robert S. |title=Presidential Succession in the United States |journal=The Journal of Politics |date=Feb 1946 |volume=8 |issue=1 |jstor=2125607 |pages=44–56 |doi=10.2307/2125607[/tpl] Henry Clay[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1741-5705.2005.00269.x |last=Abbott |first=Philip |title=Accidental Presidents: Death, Assassination, Resignation, and Democratic Succession |journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |date=Dec 2005 |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=627, 638 |jstor=27552721[/tpl] and other members of Congress, Whig party leaders, and even Tyler's own cabinet—believed that he was only acting as president, and did not have the office itself.
Nonetheless, Tyler adhered to his position, even returning unopened mail addressed to the "Acting President of the United States" sent by his detractors.[tpl]cite book |last=Crapol |first=Edward P. |title=John Tyler: the accidental president |year=2006 |publisher=UNC Press Books |isbn=978-0-8078-3041-3 |oclc=469686610 |page=10[/tpl]  Tyler's view ultimately prevailed when the Senate voted to accept the title "President," and this precedent was followed thereafter.  The question was finally resolved by Section 1 of the 25th Amendment which specifies that:  "In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President."  The Amendment does not specify whether officers other than the Vice President can become President rather than Acting President in the same set of circumstances. However, the Presidential Succession Act makes clear that anyone who takes office under its provisions shall only "act as President"—even if they "act" in that role for years. Thus only someone serving as Vice President can ever succeed to the title of "President of the United States."

==History of succession law set by Congress==

The Presidential Succession Act of 1792 was the first succession law passed by Congress.  The act was contentious because of conflict between the Federalists and Democratic-Republicans.  The Federalists did not want the Secretary of State to appear next on the list after the Vice President because Thomas Jefferson was then Secretary of State and had emerged as a Democratic-Republican leader.  There were also concerns about including the Chief Justice of the United States since that would contradict the notion of separation of powers.  The compromise that was worked out established the President pro tempore of the Senate as next in line of succession after the Vice President, followed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. In either case, these officers were to "act as President of the United States until the disability be removed or a president be elected." The Act called for a special election to be held in November of the year in which dual vacancies occurred (unless the vacancies occurred after the first Wednesday in October, in which case the election would occur the following year; or unless the vacancies occurred within the last year of the presidential term, in which case the next election would take place as regularly scheduled). The people elected President and Vice President in such a special election would have served a full four-year term beginning on March 4 of the next year, but no such election ever took place.
In 1881, after the death of President Garfield, and in 1885, after the death of Vice President Hendricks, there had been no President pro tempore in office, and as the new House of Representatives had yet to convene, no Speaker either,[tpl]cite book |title=Harper's Book of Facts: a Classified History of the World; Embracing Science, Literature, and Art |last=Lewis |first=Charlton Thomas |last2=Willsey |first2=Joseph H. |year=1895 |publisher=Harper & Brothers |location=New York |page=884 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UcwGAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA884&dq=why%20did%20cleveland%20change%20line%20of%20succession%201885&pg=PA884#v=snippet&q=country%20without%20any%20one%20in%20the%20line%20of%20succession&f=false |accessdate=Apr 24, 2011 |lccn=01020386[/tpl] leaving no one at all in the line of succession after the vice president. When Congress convened in December 1885, President Cleveland asked for a revision of the 1792 act, which was passed in 1886. Congress replaced the President pro tempore and Speaker with officers of the President's Cabinet with the Secretary of State first in line.  In the first 100 years of the United States, six former Secretaries of State had gone on to be elected President, while only two congressional leaders had advanced to that office. As a result, changing the order of the line of succession seemed reasonable.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
The Presidential Succession Act of 1947, signed into law by President Harry S. Truman, added the Speaker of the House and President pro tempore back in the line, but switched the two from the 1792 order.  It remains the sequence used [tpl]As of|2008|alt=today[/tpl]. Since the reorganization of the military in 1947 had merged the War Department (which governed the Army) with the Department of the Navy into the Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense took the place in the order of succession previously held by the Secretary of War. The office of Secretary of the Navy, which had existed as a Cabinet-level position since 1798, had become subordinate to the Secretary of Defense in the military reorganization, and so was dropped from the line of succession in the 1947 Succession Act.
Until 1971, the Postmaster General, the head of the Post Office Department, was a member of the Cabinet, initially the last in the presidential line of succession before new officers were added. Once the Post Office Department was re-organized into the United States Postal Service, a special agency independent of the executive branch, the Postmaster General ceased to be a member of the Cabinet and was thus removed from the line of succession.
The order of Cabinet members set out in the statute has always been the same as the order in which their respective departments were established.  However, when the United States Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002, many in Congress wanted the Secretary to be placed at number eight on the list – below the Attorney General, above the Secretary of the Interior, and in the position held by the Secretary of the Navy prior to the creation of the Secretary of Defense – because the Secretary, already in charge of disaster relief and security, would presumably be more prepared to take over the presidency than some of the other Cabinet secretaries.  Legislation to add the Secretary of Homeland Security to the bottom of the list was enacted on March 9, 2006.

==Successions beyond Vice President==

While nine vice presidents have succeeded to the office upon the death or resignation of the President, and two vice presidents have temporarily served as acting President, no other officer has ever been called upon to act as President.
On March 4, 1849, President Zachary Taylor's term began, but he declined to be sworn in on a Sunday, citing religious beliefs, and the vice president was not sworn either. As the last president pro tempore of the Senate, David Rice Atchison was thought by some to be next in line after the vice president, and his tombstone claims that he was US President for the day. However Atchison took no oath of office to the presidency either, and his term as Senate president pro tempore had by then expired.US Senate website: "President for a Day"Snopes.com: "President for a Day"
In 1865, when Andrew Johnson assumed the presidency on the death of Abraham Lincoln, the office of Vice President became vacant.  At that time, the Senate President pro tempore was next in line to the presidency.  In 1868 Johnson was impeached, and if he had been removed from office, President pro tempore Benjamin Wade would have become acting President. This posed a conflict of interest, as Wade's own vote on removal could have helped to determine whether he would succeed to the presidency.
In his 1979 book The Shadow Presidents Michael Medved describes a situation that arose prior to the 1916 election, when the First World War was raging in Europe. In view of the current international turmoil, President Woodrow Wilson thought that if he lost the election it would be better for his opponent to begin his administration straight away, instead of waiting through the lame duck period that at that time was almost four months long. President Wilson and his aides formed a plan to exploit the rule of succession so that his rival Charles Evans Hughes could take over the Presidency as soon as the result of the election was clear.  The plan was that Wilson would appoint Hughes to the post of Secretary of State. Wilson and his Vice President Thomas R. Marshall would then resign, and as the Secretary of State was at that time designated next in line of succession, Hughes would become President immediately. In the event, President Wilson won re-election so the plan was never put into action.[tpl]cite book|last=Medved|first=Michael|title=The Shadow Presidents: The Secret History of the Chief Executives and Their Top Aides|year=1979|publisher=Times Books|location=New York, U.S.A.|isbn=0-8129-0816-3|page=149[/tpl]
thumb|275px|New President Gerald Ford is sworn in following the resignation of Richard Nixon During the 1973 vice-presidential vacancy, House Speaker Carl Albert was first in line. As the Watergate scandal made President Nixon's removal or resignation possible, Albert would have become Acting President and—under Title 3, Section 19(c) of the U.S. Code—would have been able to "act as President until the expiration of the then current Presidential term." Albert openly questioned whether it was appropriate for him, a Democrat, to assume the powers and duties of the presidency when there was a public mandate for the presidency to be held by a Republican. Albert announced that should he need to assume the presidential powers and duties, he would do so only as a caretaker. However, with the nomination and confirmation of Gerald Ford to the vice presidency, these series of events were never tested. Albert again became first-in-line during the first four months of Ford's presidency, before the confirmation of Vice President Nelson Rockefeller.
In 1981, when President Ronald Reagan was shot, Vice President George H. W. Bush was traveling in Texas. Secretary of State Alexander Haig responded to a reporter's question regarding who was running the government by stating;
A bitter dispute ensued over the meaning of Haig's remarks. Most people believed that Haig was referring to the line of succession and erroneously claimed to have temporary presidential authority, due to his implied reference to the Constitution. Haig and his supporters, noting his familiarity with the line of succession from his time as White House Chief of Staff during Richard Nixon's resignation, said he only meant that he was the highest-ranking officer of the Executive branch on-site, managing things temporarily until the Vice President returned to Washington. Pertinent sections of the Constitution and the Presidential Succession Act show that the physical location of the Vice President is irrelevant to his or her succession to the Presidency or to acting as President.

==Constitutional concerns==

Several constitutional law experts have raised questions as to the constitutionality of the provisions that the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate succeed to the presidency."Is the Presidential Succession Law Constitutional?", Akhil Reed Amar, Stanford Law Review, November 1995.  James Madison, one of the authors of the Constitution, raised similar constitutional questions about the Presidential Succession Act of 1792 in a 1792 letter to Edmund Pendleton.uchicago.edu  Two of these issues can be summarized:
