==History==

Residents of Long Island anticipated the arrival of professional baseball for many years, until the Ducks' inaugural 2000 season. The New York Mets and the New York Yankees own the territorial rights to keep an affiliated team, Major or Minor League, from moving within 75 miles of their respective ballparks. The last attempt by any team to move to Long Island was made by the Albany-Colonie Yankees.  The Albany-Colonie team hoped to reestablish themselves in Suffolk County, home to the Ducks, but the Mets prevented the move. The Yankees later moved to Norwich, Connecticut, becoming the Norwich Navigators and, later, the Connecticut Defenders (now the Richmond Flying Squirrels).[tpl]cite web | title=History of Long Island baseball | work=digitalballparks.com | url=http://www.digitalballparks.com/Atlantic/Citibank3.html | accessdate=July 1, 2006[/tpl] Baseball fans on Long Island enthusiastically support the Ducks and have led the Atlantic League's attendance since its beginning.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] In 2007, team owner Frank Boulton expressed his contentment with the Ducks to Baseball America saying, "The Long Island Ducks are the best thing I've ever done in baseball."Baseball America's 2007 Independent organization of the year  Despite their success at the gate, the Ducks did not field a championship team until the 2004 season, when they defeated the Camden Riversharks in a three-game sweep to capture the Atlantic League Championship Series.
In 2005, a controversial former MLB player John Rocker signed with the Ducks in an attempt to revive his career. He asked New Yorkers to "bury the hatchet," claiming his willingness to play on Long Island proved he had matured since his controversial comments. Rocker was poorly received by the fans and ended up pitching with an 0-2 record and an ERA of 6.50.
On August 14, 2007, the Ducks appeared in national headlines in the United States after former Major League player Jos√© Offerman assaulted opposing players of the Bridgeport Bluefish.  In his second at-bat with Bluefish pitcher, Matt Beech, Offerman was hit by a pitch.  He retaliated by hitting Beech's hands with a bat, as well as striking catcher John Nathans in the head.  Nathans was taken out of the stadium on a stretcher, and Offerman was arrested and taken into custody.[tpl]cite web | title=Offerman Charges Mound, Hits Two with Bat | work=FoxSports at MSN | url=http://msn.foxsports.com/other/story/7124110?MSNHPHMA | accessdate=August 15, 2007[/tpl]

===Go Green===

The Long Island Ducks have implemented an environmental conservation program called "Go Green."  The program includes the placement of solar panels on the roof of Bethpage Ballpark to power the luxury suite level, the placing of "Ricky Recycle" receptacles throughout the ballpark for each home game so fans can recycle their bottles and cans, the enrollment in an electricity reduction program called Operation Save New York, and the participation in  "Reuse a Shoe" program, in which sneakers are collected at Bethpage Ballpark to be recycled and used for materials to create new playing surfaces and sports equipment.Go Green

==Season-by-season records==

 

==Back to Back Championships==

The Long Island Ducks won back to back Atlantic League Championships in 2012 & 2013. They have accomplished this feat despite posting losing records in each of those seasons. In each year they have defeated opponents in the championship series that won at least 25 more games than the Ducks won.
The Atlantic League uses a split season format to determine playoff berths. The league currently consists of two divisions with four teams each. The division winners in the first half play the division winners in the second half of the season in a five game playoff, then the playoff winners meet in a five game championship series. As customary in split season playoff formats, the winners of the first half division are guaranteed a playoff berth and have little incentive to win games in the second half. There is no additional benefit for a team to win a division in both halves of the season. If a team does win both halves, a wild card team is selected to compete in the playoffs against said team. The wild card team is the with the best overall record who has failed to win either half of its division. As a result it is rare for a team to win both halves of the season. Oftentimes a team who wins the first half plays to a far worse won loss record in the second half. This playoff format have proven vital to the Ducks winning their championships despite their losing records in both years.
In 2012, the Ducks won the first half of their division with a 39-30 record. With their playoff berth secure in July, they played the second half of the season to a 24-44 record finishing in last place. Their overall record was 63-74. They defeated the second half winner Southern Maryland Blue Crabs in five games in the divisional playoff series then upset the Lancaster Barnstormers, who had won a league record 88 games (against 52 losses) that year and who won both halves of its division. The Ducks were able to play the deciding fifth game in their own ballpark because the league employs a rotating division system as to what team gets home field advantage in the championship round. As such the Ducks won their title with a walk-off bunt single by SS Dan Lyons in the bottom of the ninth scoring the runner from third.
In 2013 they surprised the league by winning their second consecutive championship. They finished the first half with a 30-40 record, well behind the division winners Southern Maryland Blue Crabs at 37-32. With their playoff berth guaranteed, the Blue Crabs had little motivation to continue winning into the summer and finished the second half of their division with a far worse record of 28-42. The Ducks won a weak division in the second half with a 33-37 record, for a combined record of 63-77. It was actually the sixth best record posted in the eight team league. Meanwhile in the other division there were two teams with far superior records than the Ducks. The Sugar Land Skeeters a second year expansion team that plays just outside of Houston Texas won both division halves and posted a best overall record of 95-45, bettering the record set the year before by the Barnstormers, and better than the Ducks by a mind boggling 32 games. Their division rivals the Somerset Patriots were close behind the skeeters all season long and posted a 90-49 record, and entered the playoffs as the wild card. The Patriots posted a mild upset in the divisional playoffs by sweeping the Skeeters, and the Ducks did the same to the Blue Crabs setting up the championship series. The Ducks were helped by the late season signing of former major leaguer Lew Ford who had played in the majors as recently as 2012 and had just been released by the Baltimore Orioles AA affiliate in late August 2013. He had hit in 16 of the 17 regular season games he participated in and hit .412 in the playoffs. The Ducks defeated the Patriots in the first two games at home and the Patriots took the next two games in their park, setting up a deciding game five at Somerset. The Ducks won the game 6-4 with the help of a three run home run in the top of the fourth by Ray Navarrete, giving the Ducks a 6-1 lead that they would never relinquish. They won a championship over an opponent that was 27 1/2 games better than them in the standings. It exceeds the record at the major league level for largest deficit to overcome to win a championship series, set in 1906 when the Chicago white Sox at 93-58 defeated the Chicago Cubs at 116-36 for a 22 1/2 game differential. The Cubs record still stands today as the best regular season winning percentage in major league history.
In a league where player turnover is high as it consists of players constantly being signed away by major league affiliates, Navarrete has played for the Ducks since 2006 and is their longest tenured player, and holds most of the teams offensive records. He has become a fan favorite and has even married a former team employee. He had announced earlier in the season that he retire from playing and the game where hit the game deciding home run would be his final game as an active player.

==Ferry Cup==

The Long Island Ducks contend with the Bridgeport Bluefish over the Ferry Cup, which is sponsored by the Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Steamboat Company.

==Mascot==

The Long Island Ducks' official mascot is an anthropomorphic duck named QuackerJack.  He wears the Ducks' full home uniform with green and white sneakers.  He debuted on March 18, 2000 at Citibank Park.[tpl]cite web | title=QuackerJack | work=Long Island Ducks | url=http://www.liducks.com/QuackerJack | accessdate=June 11, 2011[/tpl]  His name alludes to a popular baseball game food produced by the Cracker Jack brand, and the quacking sound of a duck.
