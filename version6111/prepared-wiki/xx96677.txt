==History==

The company was founded in 1993, though the first aircraft, a used Boeing 737-200, arrived with Air South only on 12 July 1994. Over the following months, additional ageing 737-200s were added (all of them had been delivered to their original operators between 1968 and 1979), and by 1995, the fleet had grown to a total of seven airliners.Air South fleet table at airfleets.net[tpl]reference necessary|date=April 2013|The initial business model of Air South in the first year of operation showed a modest profit, however after  management changes and a refocusing on new airline routes, the airline failed and went bankrupt.[/tpl]
