The Bay Area Reporter is a free weekly newspaper serving the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) communities in the San Francisco Bay Area; it is one of the largest LGBT newspapers by circulation in the United States and the country's oldest continuously published newspaper of its kind.

==Background==

Co-founded by Bob Ross and Paul Bentley on April 1, 1971, the Bay Area Reporter—known by locals for most of its history by the initials B.A.R. that were included in its nameplate until April 2011—was originally distributed to gay bars in the South of Market, Castro District, and Polk Gulch areas of San Francisco. Today, the paper is distributed throughout the Bay Area and beyond.[tpl]cite news | author=Editors | title=About the BAR | url=http://www.ebar.com/about/ | work=Bay Area Reporter | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-04-06[/tpl][tpl]cite news | author=Zak Szymanski | title=Unique Local Feel Fave B.A.R.

==History==

The Bay Area Reporter has evolved from its early years of uneven editorial and news quality to become of the most respected LGBT community newspapers in the United States. Its annual Gay Pride issue in June is the largest and most-read edition of the year. It also features its reader's choice awards on its anniversary in the first week of April with a special Best of the Gays (Renamed "The Besties") edition.
In the 1980s, the Bay Area Reporter became a leading source of updated developments about the AIDS crisis; in 1983, the paper broke the story that up to 40 percent of people with AIDS in the United States were from racial and ethnic minorities, shattering a widely held stereotype that AIDS was a "white gay man's disease." In 1998, the paper made headlines around the world with its now-famous "No Obits" headline, marking the significance of HIV treatments by noting the first time since the AIDS epidemic began in 1981 that the newspaper received no death notices in a given week.
With an audited weekly circulation of 29,000, the Bay Area Reporter is the third largest LGBT newspaper in the United States, after New York's Gay City News and the Washington Blade. The award-winning newspaper is well known for its editorial commentary, investigative reporting, extensive sports journalism, and arts and entertainment writing.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Annual Audit Report 12 Month Audit | url=http://www.verifiedaudit.com/results.php?publication_name=Bay+Area+Reporter&type_of_report=circulation&publisher_name=&city=&state=&type=&Circulation+Report2=Search | publisher=Verified Audit Circulation | year=2009 | accessdate=2010-04-06[/tpl]
Co-founder Bentley sold his half-interest in the Bay Area Reporter to Ross in 1975 and died of cancer in 1991. Ross, who remained the paper's publisher, died in 2003. The name of the newspaper's parent company, Benro Enterprises Inc. (now BAR Media Inc.), was derived from a combination of Bentley and Ross. The current publisher is Michael Yamashita (who is also president and CEO of BAR Media Inc.), and the current editor-in-chief is Cynthia Laird.[tpl]cite news | author=Matthew S.

Assistant editors have included Matthew Bajko, Zak Szymanski (until 2006), and Mark Mardon (until 2006), each of whom contributed breaking news and nationally renowned articles on topics such as public health, social justice, law, race relations, transgender issues, art and music, and politics. Longtime Arts editor is Roberto Friedman. Assistant editors as of 2008 include Bajko, Jim Provenzano (who also wrote a sports column from 1996–2006), and Seth Hemmelgarn.[tpl]cite news | author=Jim Provenzano  | title=Sportstory 3.5 | url=http://www.ebar.com/columns/column.php?sec=sports&id=44 | work=The Bay Area Reporter | date=30 March 2006 | accessdate=2010-04-06[/tpl] For many years, two of the paper's most-read columnists were Wayne Friday, whose "Politics and Poker" column was a must-read for anyone interested in following LGBT-related political goings-on at San Francisco's City Hall and in Sacramento; and leather columnist Marcus Hernandez, better known as Mister Marcus. Friday retired from the newspaper in 2005. Hernandez died in 2009.
The Bay Area Reporter is a founding member of the National Gay Newspaper Guild.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=About NGNG | url=http://www.ngng.org/about.php | publisher=National Gay Newspaper Guild | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-04-06[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl]
On March 30, 2006, the newspaper published a special edition to celebrate its 35th anniversary.
In 2007, reporter-editors Bajko and Szymanski were honored by the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association with second and third place in the organization's "Sarah Pettit Memorial Award for Excellence in LGBT Media" for their collections of LGBT articles published in the Bay Area Reporter during 2006.[tpl]cite web | author=Tom Avila | title=NLGJA Announces 2007 Excellence in Journalism Award Winners & LGBT Journalists Hall of Fame Inductees | url=http://www.nlgja.org/news/30august07.html | publisher=National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association | date=30 August 2007 | accessdate=2010-04-06[/tpl]
In 2009, the GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco launched an online searchable database of the more than 10,000 obituaries and death notices that have appeared in the Bay Area Reporter, starting with the first such article published in the newspaper in 1979; many of the obituaries reflect the catastrophic toll of the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco from the early 1980s through the late 1990s.[ref]

The paper celebrated its 40th anniversary with a special edition published April 8, 2011, and with a weeklong mini-exhibition and slide show of historic front pages at The GLBT History Museum in the Castro District of San Francisco.[tpl]Cite news | last = Wright | first = Chris| title = The Bay Area Reporter, the USA's oldest continuously published LGBT newspaper, celebrates 40th anniversary | newspaper = Stark Insider | date = 2011-03-25| url = http://www.starkinsider.com/2011/03/the-bay-area-reporter-the-usa’s-oldest-continuously-published-lgbt-newspaper-celebrates-40th-anniversary.html | accessdate = 2011-04-09[/tpl] The following week saw the Bay Area Reporter completely redesigned—and without its longtime B.A.R. initials, which were dropped not only from its nameplate, but also from all references to the newspaper in its articles. Even the paper's Website now bears a new URL -- bayareareporter.org—although its original URL, ebar.com still functions.
In April 2013, it was announced that the San Francisco Newspaper Co., which owned the alternative weeklies San Francisco Bay Guardian and SF Weekly and the daily San Francisco Examiner, agreed to purchase a 49 percent minority stake in the Bay Area Reporter. A new company, BAR Media, Inc., was created, with Michael Yamashita, the newspaper's longtime general manager, becoming publisher with a 31 percent ownership. The Bob Ross Foundation, parent of Benro Enterprises Inc., would own 20 percent while Todd Vogt and Patrick Brown, the principal owners of the San Francisco Newspaper Co., would own the remaining 49 percent. Under the new structure, Yamashita became president and CEO of BAR Media Inc., while Thomas E. Horn, the foundation's executive director and the paper's publisher from 2003 to 2013, was named chairman of the board. Brown became the new company's vice president and chief financial officer.[ref]

Yamashita is the first Asian-American publisher of an LGBT newspaper in the United States.
Under the new structure, the Bay Area Reporter gained a larger advertiser base and an expansion of the paper's distribution to parts of the San Francisco Bay Area it had never circulated before, including Contra Costa, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. By October 2013, the newspaper's offices and newsroom were moved from its longtime building on Ninth Street in the South of Market area to the 17th-floor headquarters of the San Francisco Newspaper Co. at 225 Bush Street in the city's downtown Financial District.
