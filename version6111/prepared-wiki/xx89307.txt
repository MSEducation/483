==Identity and background==

Andrea Levy is of primarily Afro-Jamaican descent. She has a Jewish paternal grandfather and a Scots maternal great-grandfather."This is my England" | Books. The Guardian. Retrieved on 10 August 2011.
In her mid-twenties she did work for a social institution that included dealing with racist attacks. She also worked part-time in the BBC costume department, while starting a graphic design company with her husband Bill Mayblin. During this time she experienced a form of awakening to her identity concerning both her gender and her race. She also became aware of the power of books and began to read "excessively": it was easy enough to find literature by black writers from the United States, but she could find very little literature from black writers in the United Kingdom.Raekha Prasad, "Two sides to every story", The Guardian, 4 March 1999.
Levy began writing only in her mid-thirties, having enrolled in Alison Fell's Creative Writing class at the City Lit in 1989, continuing on the course for seven years.Interview with Andrea Levy, City Lit, 30 July 2010. 

==Writings and critical reception==

When in 1994 Levy's first novel, the semi-autobiographical Every Light in the House Burnin′, was published, it attracted favourable reviews. The Independent on Sunday stated: "This story of a young girl in the 60s in north London, child of Jamaican migrants, stands comparison with some of the best stories about growing up poor – humorous and moving, unflinching and without sentiment.""Lazy days of summer reading", Independent on Sunday, 2 July 1995. Levy has spoken of the year of rejections that followed that first novel's publication: "Publishers have a herd mentality. They were worried that I'd be read only by black people.... Apart from African-American writers and Yardie, there was nothing to show I'd sell.... No one had been really successful as a black British writer writing about everyday things."
Levy's second novel, Never Far from Nowhere is a coming-of-age story about two sisters of Jamaican parentage growing up in London in the 1960s and '70s. The novel is narrated from the perspectives of Vivien and Olive and chronicles their difficulties living in 70s England. The narrative focuses specifically on the physical differences between the sisters in terms of skin color, eye color, and hair type, that causes them to be treated different by British people and the ways in which they negotiate and constitute racial and national identities. The novel was longlisted for the Orange Prize. After its publication, Levy visited Jamaica for the first time and what she learned of her family's past provided material for her next book.George Stade & Karen Karbiener (eds), Encyclopedia of British Writers, 1800 to the Present, Volume 2, NY: Facts on File, 2009, p. 297. 
Fruit of the Lemon, set in England and Jamaica in the Thatcher era, "explores the notion of home, and how it differs for the formerly colonized and their descendants," as the New York Times noted: "Though Levy writes specifically about black Jamaican Britons and their struggles to be acknowledged as full members of the larger society, her novel illuminates the general situation facing all children of postcolonial immigrants across the West, from the banlieue of France to the Islamic neighborhoods of New York to the Hispanic ghettos of Los Angeles."Uzodinma Iweala, "Colonial Castoff", The New York Times, 11 February 2007. 
Levy's fourth novel, Small Island (2004), put her in a new major literary league.Lisa Allardice, The Guardian profile: Andrea Levy, 21 January 2005. As Mike Phillips wrote: "Small Island is a great read, delivering the sort of pleasure which has been the traditional stock-in-trade of a long line of English novelists. It's honest, skilful, thoughtful and important. This is Andrea Levy's big book."Mike Phillips, "Roots manoeuvre", 14 February 2004. It won three prestigious awards: Whitbread Book of the Year, the Orange Prize for Fiction, and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize. It has since been made into a television drama, which was broadcast by the BBC in December 2009.Welcome to my website. Andrea Levy. Retrieved on 10 August 2011. 
Her fifth novel, The Long Song, won the 2011 Walter Scott PrizeAlison Flood. "Andrea Levy wins Walter Scott prize", The Guardian, 20 June 2011 and was short-listed for the 2010 Man Booker Prize. The Telegraph called it a "sensational novel... that tells the life story of July, a slave girl living on a sugar plantation in 1830s Jamaica just as emancipation is juddering into action."Holly Kyte, "The Long Song by Andrea Levy: review", The Telegraph, 27 January 2010. Kate Kellaway in The Observer commented: "The Long Song reads with the sort of ebullient effortlessness that can only be won by hard work."Kate Kellaway, "The Long Song by Andrea Levy", The Observer, 7 February 2010. The Washington Post reviewer, calling it "insightful and inspired", went on to say of Levy's work: "The Long Song" reminds us that she is one of the best historical novelists of her generation."Tayari Jones, "Book review: 'The Long Song,' by Andrea Levy", Washington Post, 8 May 2010.
