Underwood, Nottinghamshire is a  hilltop village within the civil parish of Selston in the District of Ashfield. It stands in a former colliery district. The village offers views across the Erewash Valley towards the Southern Pennines. It is situated very close to junction 27 of the M1. It is bordered by Bagthorpe and Selston, and Brinsley and Moorgreen to the south. Felley Priory, with its  gardens is accessed from the village.
It is part of Nottinghamshires 'Hidden Valleys' area.
Bagthorpe Primary School, and particularly Underwood Church of England Primary School have good reputations, and as a consequence the area is a desirable one for families. This has caused house prices to be much higher in Underwood and Bagthorpe than in the surrounding areas, resulting in the villages having high levels of affluence, especially in Lower Bagthorpe and the area along Main Road, Underwood.
The village has numerous public houses including The Brick and Tile, The Hole in the Wall, Miners Welfare, The Red Lion, Dixies Arms, The Shepherds Rest, and The Dog & Quayle (previously The Sandhills).
