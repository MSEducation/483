==Biography==

Robert John Lange was born in Mufulira, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). Raised in Durban, Kwa-zulu natal, South Africa, his mother came from a prosperous family in Germany, and his South African father was a mining engineer. Nicknamed "Mutt" at an early age, Lange grew up a fan of country music, in particular the singer Slim Whitman. Sent to study at Belfast High School in South Africa, he started a music band in which he played rhythm guitar and sang harmonies. After his national service (1966-1967) he formed the band Hocus which did not survive his move to London. He eventually married Stevie van Kerken (a.k.a. Stevie Vann) and moved to England. The marriage broke down in the 1970s. Whilst still married, Lange began seeing Belfast-born employee Oonagh O'Reilly, a relationship that lasted five years.
In 1978, Lange wrote and produced Ipswich Town's FA Cup final single Ipswich Ipswich Get That Goal, his connection with the club being due to their South Africa-born player Colin Viljoen.
Beginning production work in 1976, his first major hits came in October 1978 with the UK #1 single "Rat Trap" for The Boomtown Rats, followed in July 1979 with AC/DC's hard rock album Highway to Hell (#8 UK, #17 US). He produced two more albums with AC/DC, including Back in Black (1980) which is currently the fourth best-selling album of all time. He also worked with rock group Foreigner with 4, and with Def Leppard on their hit albums, High 'n' Dry, Pyromania, Hysteria and Adrenalize co-writing most of the songs. Though he did not produce AC/DC's 1983 album Flick of the Switch, it was rumored that during the completion of that album he was asked to help his long time engineer Tony Platt finish it up by giving it a listen. Mutt also produced a total of five albums for Birmingham, UK band City Boy.
After Hysteria, Lange bowed out of working with Def Leppard while they were at their peak.Mutt Lange He would return to work with them years later in a more limited role in 1999, co-writing three tracks for their album Euphoria. One of these songs, "Promises", was a Number 1 hit on the mainstream rock charts for the band.
In 1991, he produced Bryan Adams's Waking Up the Neighbours, including co-writing "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You", a hugely successful single written for the Kevin Costner film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves that currently holds the record for the longest consecutive Number 1 UK chart single with 16 consecutive weeks at the top of the charts (7 July-26 October 1991).
After hearing Shania Twain's material, he got in touch with her and they spent many hours on the phone. They finally met six months after the initial contact and were married on 28 December 1993. Because Lange is a teetotaller, they had non-alcoholic champagne at their wedding. Lange also had the song "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You" performed as a sign of his dedication. In August 2001, their son Eja (pronounced "Asia") was born. On 15 May 2008 a spokesman for Mercury Nashville announced that Twain and Lange were separating after Lange had an affair. Lange began seeing Twain's best friend, Marie-Anne Thiebaud.Shania Twain, Mutt Lange Separating After 14 Years The couple divorced in June 2010, and Twain is now married to Thiebaud's ex-husband Frederic.
