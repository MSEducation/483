"Ein Hoch der Liebe" ("A Toast to Love") was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1968, performed in German by Norwegian singer Wencke Myhre. Myhre was the first of three female Scandinavian schlager artists to represent Germany in the Contest in the late 60s and early 70s, the second being Swedish Siw Malmkvist in 1969 with "Primaballerina" and the third Danish Gitte Hænning with "Junger Tag in 1973.
The song was performed sixteenth on the night, following Spain's Massiel with "La, la, la" and preceding Yugoslavia's Dubrovački trubaduri with "Jedan dan". At the close of voting, it had received 11 points, placing 6th in a field of 17.
The song is in praise of love itself, with Myhre singing that it "keeps our world so young" and is a generally enjoyable experience. Myhre also recorded the song in her mother tongue Norwegian and Swedish, entitled "Si ja til kjærlighet" and "Säg ja till kärleken" respectively (translated: "Say Yes to Love").
It was succeeded as German representative at the 1969 Contest by Siw Malmkvist with "Primaballerina".
