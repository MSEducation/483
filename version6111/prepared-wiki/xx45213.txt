The Lewinsky scandal was a political sex scandal emerging in 1998, from a sexual relationship between United States President Bill Clinton and a 22-year-old White House Intern, Monica Lewinsky. The news of this extra-marital affair and the resulting investigation eventually led to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives and his subsequent acquittal on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial.[tpl]cite book|last=Posner|first=Richard A,|title=An Affair of State The Investigation, Impeachment, and Trial of President Clinton|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/p/posner-affair.html|accessdate=March 1, 2012|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-00080-3|chapter=Introduction[/tpl]
In 1995, Lewinsky, a graduate of Lewis & Clark College, was hired to work as an intern at the White House during Clinton's first term, and began a personal relationship with him, the details of which she later confided to her friend and Defense Department co-worker Linda Tripp, who secretly recorded their telephone conversations.[tpl]cite news |title=Tripp: I Am Not Intimidated |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/07/07/archive/main13349.shtml |date=July 7, 1998 |accessdate=January 26, 2010 |publisher=CBS |quote=In January, Tripp gave Starr the tapes.

When Tripp discovered in January 1998 that Lewinsky had sworn an affidavit in the Paula Jones case denying a relationship with Clinton, she delivered the tapes to Kenneth Starr, the Independent Counsel who was investigating Clinton on other matters, including the Whitewater scandal, the White House FBI files controversy, and the White House travel office controversy. During the grand jury testimony Clinton's responses were carefully worded, and he argued, "It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is",[tpl]cite news |first=Timothy |last= Noah |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1000162/ |title= Bill Clinton and the Meaning of "Is" |work=Slate |date=September 13, 1998 |accessdate=July 15, 2009 [/tpl] in regards to the truthfulness of his statement that "there is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship."President Bill Clinton, The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, 21 January 1998.

==Allegations of sexual contact==

Lewinsky claimed to have had sexual encounters with Bill Clinton on nine occasions from November 1995 to March 1997. According to her published schedule, First Lady Hillary Clinton was at the White House for at least some portion of seven of those days.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-03-19-852575883_x.htm| title= Lewinsky and the first lady| date= March 19, 2008 |agency= Associated Press |work= USA Today |accessdate= January 19, 2010[/tpl]
In April 1996, Lewinsky's superiors relocated her job to the Pentagon, because they felt that she was spending too much time around Clinton.Jeff Leen (January 24, 1998). "Lewinsky: Two Coasts, Two Lives, Many Images", The Washington Post. According to his autobiography, then-United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson was asked by the White House in 1997 to interview Lewinsky for a job on his staff at the UN. Richardson did so, and offered her a position, which she declined.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/bill-richardson-caught-in-clinton-undertow/|title=Bill Richardson Caught In Clinton Undertow| last1= Irvine| first1= Reed| first2= Cliff |last2= Kincaid|date=August 21, 1998|publisher=Accuracy in Media|accessdate=March 5, 2012[/tpl] The American Spectator alleged that Richardson knew more about the Lewinsky affair than he declared to the grand jury.[tpl]cite news| url=http://spectator.org/archives/1998/11/15/slick-billy/|title=The American Spectator : Slick Billy|last=York|first=Byron|date=November 15, 1998|work=American Spectator| accessdate=March 5, 2012[/tpl]
Lewinsky confided in a coworker named Linda Tripp about her relationship with Clinton. Tripp convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her, and not to dry clean what would later be known as the "infamous blue dress". Tripp reported these conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg, who advised her to secretly record them,US News and World Report, "The Monica Lewinsky Tapes", 2 February 1998, v.124 n.4 p.23. which Tripp began doing in September 1997. Goldberg also urged Tripp to take the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and bring them to the attention of people working on the Paula Jones case.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/93748|work=Newsweek|title=The Goldberg-Tripp-Jones Axis|date=November 9, 1998|first1= Evan |last1= Thomas |first2= Michael |last2= Isikoff[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2011[/tpl] In the fall of 1997, Goldberg began speaking to reporters (notably Michael Isikoff of Newsweek) about the tapes.[tpl]cite news|work=Time|title=Lucianne Goldberg: in pursuit of Clinton|date=February 2, 1998|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,987748,00.html|first1= John |last1= Cloud |first2= Edward |last2= Barnes |first3= Richard |last3= Zoglin[/tpl]
In January 1998, after Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit in the Paula Jones case denying any physical relationship with Clinton, she attempted to persuade Tripp to lie under oath in the Jones case.  Instead, Tripp gave the tapes to Starr who was investigating the Whitewater controversy and other matters. Now armed with evidence of Lewinsky's admission of a physical relationship with Clinton, he broadened the investigation to include Lewinsky and her possible perjury in the Jones case.

==Denial and subsequent admission==

News of the scandal first broke on January 17, 1998, on the Drudge Report,"Newsweek Kills Story On White House Intern", DrudgeReportArchives, 1998. which reported that Newsweek editors were sitting on a story by investigative reporter Michael Isikoff exposing the affair. The story broke in the mainstream press on January 21 in The Washington Post.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/clinton012198.htm|title=Special Report: Clinton Accused| last= Schmidt| first= Susan| coauthors= Peter Baker and Toni Locy|date=January 21, 1998|work=The Washington Post| accessdate=August 26, 2010[/tpl] The story swirled for several days and, despite swift denials from Clinton, the clamor for answers from the White House grew louder. On January 26, President Clinton, standing with his wife, spoke at a White House press conference, and issued a forceful denial, which contained what would later become one of the best-known sound bites of all time:Top 5: Political Quotes That Defined Presidencies, APOLITICUS.COM
Pundits debated whether or not Clinton would address the allegations in his State of the Union Address. Ultimately, he chose not to mention them. Hillary Clinton stood by her husband throughout the scandal. On January 27, in an appearance on NBC's Today she famously said, "The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president."
For the next several months and through the summer, the media debated whether or not an affair had occurred and whether or not Clinton had lied or obstructed justice, but nothing could be definitively established beyond the taped recordings because Lewinsky was unwilling to discuss the affair or testify about it. On July 28, 1998, a substantial delay after the public break of the scandal, Lewinsky received transactional immunity in exchange for grand jury testimony concerning her relationship with Clinton.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/07/28/lewinsky/|title=Lewinsky Strikes Far-Reaching Immunity Deal|last1= Blitzer| first1= Wolf|last2= Franken |first2= Bob|date=July 28, 1998|publisher=CNN| accessdate=9 March 2013[/tpl]  She also turned over a semen-stained blue dress (which Linda Tripp had encouraged her to save without dry cleaning) to the Starr investigators, thereby providing unambiguous DNA evidence that could prove the relationship despite Clinton's official denials.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/icreport/6narrit.htm#L28 | title=Starr Report | publisher= The Washington Post| accessdate=9 May 2013 | date=September 15, 1998[/tpl]
Clinton admitted in taped grand jury testimony on August 17, 1998, that he had had an "improper physical relationship" with Lewinsky. That evening he gave a nationally televised statement admitting his relationship with Lewinsky which was "not appropriate".Clinton, Bill. Address to the nation, PBS.org, 17 August 1998.

==Perjury charges==

In his deposition for the Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied having "sexual relations" with Lewinsky. Based on the evidence provided by Tripp, a blue dress with Clinton's semen, Starr concluded that this sworn testimony was false and perjurious.
During the deposition, Clinton was asked "Have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1?" The judge ordered that Clinton be given an opportunity to review the agreed definition. Afterwards, based on the definition created by the Independent Counsel's Office, Clinton answered "I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky." Clinton later stated, "I thought the definition included any activity by me, where I was the actor and came in contact with those parts of the bodies" which had been explicitly listed (and "with an intent to gratify or arouse the sexual desire of any person"). In other words, Clinton denied that he had ever contacted Lewinsky's "genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks", and effectively claimed that the agreed-upon definition of "sexual relations" included giving oral sex but excluded receiving oral sex.Tiersma, Peter. "The Language of Perjury", languageandlaw.org, 20 November 2007.
Two months after the Senate failed to convict him, President Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/13/us/clinton-is-found-to-be-in-contempt-on-jones-lawsuit.html|title=Clinton is found to be in contempt on Jones lawsuit |last2= Lewis| first1= John M. |last1= Broder |first2=Neil A.|date=April 13, 1999|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=March 5, 2012[/tpl]  His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years and later by the United States Supreme Court.[tpl]cite news| url= http://famguardian.org/Subjects/LawAndGovt/News/ClintonDisbar-011001.htm |title= Clinton Disbarred From Supreme Court |publisher= Family Guardian |first= Anne |last= Gearan |agency= Associated Press |date= 1 October 2001[/tpl] He was also fined $90,000 for giving false testimony.[tpl]cite news| url= http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/30/news/mn-61021 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Robert L. | last=Jackson | title=Clinton Fined $90,686 for Lying in Paula Jones Case | date=July 30, 1999[/tpl]
==Impeachment== 
In December 1998, Clinton's political party, the Democratic Party, was in the minority in both chambers of Congress. Some Democratic members of Congress, and most in the opposition Republican Party, believed that Clinton's giving false testimony and allegedly influencing Lewinsky's testimony were crimes of obstruction of justice and perjury and thus impeachable offenses.  The House of Representatives voted to issue Articles of Impeachment against him which was followed by a 21-day trial in the Senate.
All of the Democrats in the Senate voted for acquittal on both the perjury and the obstruction of justice charges.  Ten Republicans voted for acquittal for perjury: John Chafee (Rhode Island), Susan Collins (Maine), Slade Gorton (Washington), Jim Jeffords (Vermont), Richard Shelby (Alabama), Olympia Snowe (Maine), Arlen Specter (Pennsylvania), Ted Stevens (Alaska), Fred Thompson (Tennessee), and John Warner (Virginia). Five Republicans voted for acquittal for obstruction of justice: Chafee, Collins, Jeffords, Snowe, and Specter.
President Clinton was thereby acquitted of all charges and remained in office.  There were attempts to censure the President by the House of Representatives, but those attempts failed.

==Aftermath==

===Effect on 2000 presidential election===

The scandal arguably affected the 2000 US Presidential election in two contradictory ways. Democratic Party candidate and sitting Vice President Al Gore claimed that Clinton's scandal had been "a drag" that deflated the enthusiasm of their party's base, effectively suppressing Democratic votes. Clinton claimed that the scandal had made Gore's campaign too cautious, and that if Clinton had been allowed to campaign for Gore in Arkansas and New Hampshire, either state would have delivered Gore's needed electoral votes regardless of what happened in Florida.[tpl]cite news| title= Bill Clinton on Lewinsky Affair: 'I Cracked' | first= Brian |last= Montopoli| work=Political Hotsheet |publisher= CBS News |date= 21 September 2009 |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/09/21/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5327644.shtml |accessdate= 21 September 2009[/tpl]
Political analysts have supported both views. Before and after the 2000 election, John Cochran of ABC News connected the Lewinsky scandal with a voter phenomenon he called "Clinton fatigue".[tpl]cite book| title=Missed opportunity: Gore, incumbency and television in election 2000 |first=Edwin D. |last= Dover |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2002 | isbn= 978-0-275-97638-5 |page= 130|quote= John Cochran on ABC described this phenomenon as "Clinton fatigue." He said voters were happy with the policy agenda and direction of the country but were tired of Clinton and wanted to forget him. Casting their votes for Bush and not for Clinton's surrogate, Gore, was one way to bring about this preferred change, Cochran concluded.[/tpl] Polling showed that the scandal continued to affect Clinton's low personal approval ratings through the election,[tpl]cite book| title= The 2000 Presidential Campaign: A Communication Perspective | series= Volume 2000, Part 3 |first= Robert E.

===Collateral scandals===

During the scandal, supporters of President Clinton alleged that the matter was private and "about sex", and they claimed hypocrisy by at least some of those who advocated for his removal. For example, during the House investigation it was revealed that Henry Hyde, Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee and lead House manager, also had an affair while in office as a state legislator. Hyde, aged 70 during the Lewinsky hearings, dismissed it as a "youthful indiscretion" when he was 41.Talbot, David. "This hypocrite broke up my family", Salon.com, 16 September 1998.
A highly publicized investigation campaign actively sought information that might embarrass politicians who supported impeachment. According to the British newspaper The Guardian,
 
 Larry Flynt...the publisher of Hustler magazine, offered a $1 million reward... Flynt was a sworn enemy of the Republican party and sought to dig up dirt on the Republican members of Congress who were leading the impeachment campaign against President Clinton.
...Although Flynt claimed at the time to have the goods on up to a dozen prominent Republicans, the ad campaign helped to bring down only one. Robert Livingston – a congressman from Louisiana...abruptly retired after learning that Mr. Flynt was about to reveal that he had also had an affair.Goldenberg, Suzanne. "Porn king offers $1m for US political sex scandal" The Guardian, London. retrieved September 21, 2009.

Republican congressman Bob Livingston had been widely expected to become Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in the next Congressional session,"Robert Livingston, The Heir Apparent With a Black Belt", The New York Times, 10 November 1998, p. A24. retrieved September 21, 2009. then just weeks away, until Flynt revealed the affair.  Livingston resigned and challenged Clinton to do the same.
Flynt's investigation also claimed that Congressman Bob Barr, another Republican House manager, had an affair while married; Barr had been the first lawmaker in either chamber to call for Clinton's resignation due to the Lewinsky affair. Barr lost a primary challenge less than three years after the impeachment proceedings.McCaffrey, Shannon. Will Bob Barr be the Ralph Nader of '08?, Associated Press (via CBS News), 22 June 2008.
Dan Burton, Republican Representative from Indiana, had stated "No one, regardless of what party they serve, no one, regardless of what branch of government they serve, should be allowed to get away with these alleged sexual improprieties...."Baker, Russ. "Portrait of a political 'pit bull'", Salon, December 22, 1998. In 1998, Burton admitted that he himself had an affair in 1983 that produced a child."Rep.

===Personal acceptance===

Historian Taylor Branch implied that Clinton had requested changes to Branch's 2009 Clinton biography, The Clinton Tapes: Wrestling History with the President, regarding Clinton's revelation that the Lewinsky affair began because "I cracked; I just cracked." Branch writes that Clinton had felt "beleaguered, unappreciated, and open to a liaison with Lewinsky" following "the Democrats' loss of Congress in the November 1994 elections, the death of his mother the previous January, and the ongoing Whitewater investigation".[tpl]cite news| title= Secret interviews add insight to Clinton presidency | first= Susan |last= Page |newspaper= USA Today | date=21 September 2009 |url= http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-09-21-clinton-tapes_N.htm |accessdate= 21 September 2009[/tpl] Publicly, Clinton had previously blamed the affair on "a terrible moral error" and on anger at Republicans, stating, "if people have unresolved anger, it makes them do non-rational, destructive things."[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/20/clinton.book/ |title= Clinton: Lewinsky affair a 'terrible moral error'| publisher= CNN |date= 21 June 2004 |accessdate= 9 May 2013[/tpl]
