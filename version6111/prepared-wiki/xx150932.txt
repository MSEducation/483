==History==

The station, initially with call letters K32CL, began as an original construction permit issued August 16, 1988 to Gary M. and Deborah R. Kenny. It was licensed June 30, 1989, serving the Neosho area on channel 32. In September 1998, the Kennys changed the station's call letters to KJPX-LP and in October 2001, upgraded the station's license to Class A. The Kennys again changed the station's call letters in April 2002 to KCLG-CA and again to KCLG-LP. The KJPX-LP call letters would end up on another television station owned by the Kennys in Joplin. On May 30, 2012, the station's call sign was changed to KCLG-LD.
