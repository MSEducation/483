CATEGORIES: Fencing at the 2011 Pan American Games

The men's team sabre competition of the fencing events at the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara, Mexico, was held on October 29 at the Multipurpose Gymnasium.[tpl]cite web|title=Fencing technical manual|url=http://www.guadalajara2011.org.mx/documentos/manuales/eng/technical/tm_fencing.pdf|publisher=Guadalajara 2011|accessdate=21 October 2011[/tpl] The defending champion was the team from the United States.
The team sabre competition consisted of a three-round single-elimination bracket with a bronze medal match between the two semifinal losers and classification semifinals and finals for 5th to 8th places. Teams consist of three members each. Matches consist of nine bouts, with every fencer on one team facing each fencer on the other team. Scoring carried over between bouts with a total of 45 touches being the team goal. Bouts lasted until one team reached the target multiple of 5 touches. For example, if the first bout ended with a score of 5-3, that score would remain into the next bout and the second bout would last until one team reached 10 touches. Bouts also had a maximum time of three minutes each; if the final bout ended before either team reached 45 touches, the team leading at that point won. A tie at that point would result in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period. This sudden-death period was further modified by the selection of a draw-winner beforehand; if neither fencer scored a touch during the minute, the predetermined draw-winner won the bout.
