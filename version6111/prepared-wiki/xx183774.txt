==Plot==

On a camping trip in the mountains, a dad (Peter Graves) and his two teenage children are exploring a cave when a solar flare hits. After emerging, they soon find that everyone is dead - their bodies have turned to a powdery substance inside their clothing - and there are only a few survivors left scattered across the country. Most, out of fear and survival, are out for themselves, but as they try to make their way home (where the mother had returned earlier from the camping trip), they find two people that need their help as well as a man who invites them to be neighbors.
They face dangers ranging from wild dogs, who seem to have been driven mad from the solar flare, to a gunman who steals their car. They rescue a woman (Verna Bloom), and later a young boy whose family was killed by two men who stole their car. Besides the physical journey, they struggle to overcome the emotional trauma of the events.
