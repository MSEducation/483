CATEGORIES: Cocktails with vodka, Cocktails with coffee liqueur

 
A White Russian is a sweet cocktail classically made with vodka, coffee liqueur (e.g., Kahlúa or Tia Maria), and cream served with ice in an Old Fashioned glass. 

==Name origin==

The traditional cocktail known as a Black Russian, which first appeared in 1949, becomes a White Russian with the addition of cream. Neither drink is Russian in origin, but both are so named due to vodka being the primary ingredient. It is unclear which drink preceded the other.[tpl]Cite web | last = Sicard | first = Cheri | title = Featured Cocktails – Black Russian and White Russian | publisher = FabulousFoods.com | date = August 6, 2007 | url = http://www.fabulousfoods.com/index.php?option=com_resource&controller=article&article=21219&category_id=237&Itemid=177 | accessdate = June 8, 2010[/tpl]10 Famous Cocktails and Where They Were Born
The Oxford English Dictionary refers to the first mention of the word "White Russian" in the sense of a cocktail as appearing in California's Oakland Tribune on November 21, 1965.  It was placed in the newspaper as an insert: "White Russian. 1 oz. each Southern, vodka, cream",[tpl]Cite encyclopedia | title = White Russian, n. and a. | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary | date = June 2007 | url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50284859  | accessdate = May 6, 2010[/tpl] with "Southern" referring to Coffee Southern, a contemporary brand of coffee liqueur.[tpl]cite web |url=http://thealcoholenthusiast.com/2011/05/11/an-enthusiasts-guide-to-cocktails-the-white-russian/ |title=An Enthusiast’s Guide to Cocktails: the White Russian|publisher=The Alcohol Enthusiast |date=May 11, 2011|accessdate=December 2, 2011[/tpl]

==Preparation==

As with all cocktails, various modes of preparation exist, varying according to the recipes and styles of particular bars or mixologists.  Most common varieties have adjusted amounts of vodka or coffee liqueur, or mixed brands of coffee liqueur.  Shaking the cream in order to thicken it prior to pouring it over the drink is also common. Kahlúa is the brand of coffee liqueur most commonly associated with White Russians, mostly because it has become something of a genericized trademark for coffee liqueur. In Ireland, a popular variety of the drink consists of one part vodka, one part Kahlúa and four parts full cream milk shaken with ice and served in a tumbler glass on the rocks.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]

===Variations===

Many variants of the cocktail exist, both localized and widely known, such as a White Canadian (made with goat's milk), a Blind Russian (made with Baileys Irish Cream instead of cream – the “Blind” comes from the drink being made with all-alcoholic ingredients), a White Mexican (made with horchata), an Anna Kournikova (made with skim milk, i.e. a “skinny, low-fat White Russian”), a White Cuban (made with rum instead of vodka), a White Belgian (made with chocolate liqueur instead of  coffee liqueur), and a Dirty Russian (made with chocolate milk instead of cream).[tpl]Cite web | title=The Snows of Revolution | work=The Boise Weekly | year=2006 | url=http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/the-snows-of-revolution/Content?oid=930015 | accessdate =December 31, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite web | title = White Russian | publisher=Conan's Pub | year=2006 | url=http://www.conans-pub.com/cocktails/white-russian.html | accessdate=May 6, 2010[/tpl]

==In popular culture==

The White Russian is the signature drink of the Dude, the protagonist of the cult classic The Big Lebowski. In the movie, the Dude refers to it as a "Caucasian." 
The cocktail's prominence in the film has been connected to a revival in its popularity.[tpl]cite news|last=Kurutz|first=Steven|title=White Russians Arise, This Time at a Bowling Alley|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/dining/03lebo.html|accessdate=9 January 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 December 2008[/tpl]
