If the playa is wet for a month or so, the shallow waters teem with fairy shrimp, or anostraca born of eggs that lay dormant in the silt crust for long periods of time - sometimes for many years. The edges of the playa and the Quinn River Sink stay wet longer than the rest of the playa, which concentrates the fairy shrimp and migratory birds in those areas. More than 250 species of neo-tropical birds and many other water birds stop in Black Rock-High Rock Country for varying lengths of time. When wet, especially in spring, the playa is a favorite place for these winged visitors to rest and feed.
When it rains, the playa can become extremely sticky, bogging down four-wheel-drive vehicles. Some areas of the Black Rock are environmentally sensitive and closed to all vehicles.
Humboldt, Pershing and Washoe Counties of Nevada intersect at the Black Rock Desert.

===Mountain ranges===

The following mountain ranges are within or bordering the Black Rock Desert region.thumb|Calico Mountains Black Rock Desert Nevada

===Geologic features===

The desert has numerous volcanic and geothermal features of the northwest Nevada volcanic region, including two Black Rock Points (west and east) at the southern end of the Black Rock Range and which have dark Permian volcanic rocks similar to another Permian black diabase dike formation in Nevada.[tpl]cite web |last=Wyld |first=Sandra J |author2=et. al |year=2007 |title=Identification of a Distinct Terrane in the Cordillerâ€¦ |publisher=University of Georgia |url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2007CD/finalprogram/abstract_121329.htm |accessdate=2010-05-13[/tpl]
The portion of the Lake Lahontan lakebed in the Black Rock Desert is generally flat with Lahontan salt shrub vegetation, widely-scattered hot springs, and a playa.  In areas of the lakebed along mountains, rain shadow results in desert precipitation levels.
The playa of the Black Rock Desert lakebed is ~[tpl]convert|200|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] within an area bounded by the Calico Mountains Wilderness (north), Gerlach (west), the Applegate National Historic Trail (northeast), and the Union Pacific Railroad (south).  The "South Playa" (~30 sq mi, with ~[tpl]convert|13|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] in Washoe Co) is between Gerlach and the southwest boundary of the National Conservation Area (NCA), while the northeast NCA portion of the playa (including ~[tpl]convert|25|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] in Humboldt Co) is between the NCA boundary and the Applegate National Historic Trail.[tpl]cite map |title=Reference Map |url=http://www.nv.blm.gov/Winnemucca/blackrock/RMP/maps_gif/map_1-01_reference.gif |format=gif |work=Resource Management Plan |publisher=Bureau of Land Management |accessdate=May 2010 [/tpl]  A Nobles route between Gerlach and Black Rock Hot Springs extends through the length of the playa.  The playa's Quinn River Sink of ~[tpl]convert|3|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] is where the Quinn River discharges/evaporates ~[tpl]convert|2.75|mi|km|abb=on[/tpl] south-southwest of Black Rock Hot Springs.

===Mining===

Prospecting and mining has occurred in the Black Rock region since the mid-19th century.  US Gypsum Corporation operated a gypsum mine and drywall (brand named Sheetrock) manufacturing plant in Empire, which employed 107 people and produced 266,300 tons of gypsum in 2008.
Allied Nevada Gold Corporation re-opened the Hycroft Gold Mine in 2008 after acquiring it from Vista Gold Corp.  Hycroft is a strip-mining operation in the Kamma Mountains near Sulphur on the east side of the Black Rock Desert.[ref]
