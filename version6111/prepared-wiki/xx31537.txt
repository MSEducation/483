==History==

The Big 12 Conference is the second youngest of the major college athletic conferences in the United States, having formed in 1994 from a merger of one of the oldest conferences, the Big Eight, with four prominent colleges from Texas that had been members of the Southwest Conference. From its formation until 2011, its 12 members competed in two divisions. Two charter members left the conference in 2011, and in 2012, two more left, while another two joined from other conferences.  In 2012, the Big 12 formed an alliance with the Southeastern Conference to host a joint post-season college bowl game between the champions of each conference, which would eventually become the Sugar Bowl.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Origins===

====College Football Association last days====

On June 27, 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in NCAA v. Board of Regents of University of Oklahoma that the NCAA could not punish its membership for selling their media content. As a result, individual schools and athletic conferences were freed to negotiate contracts on their own behalf.
The Big Ten and Pacific-10 conferences sold their rights to ABC.  Most of the rest of the Division I-A football programs (what is now called the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision) chose to sell their rights together through an organization called the College Football Association to ABC and CBS.  The primary function of the CFA was to negotiate television broadcast rights for its member conferences and independent colleges.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
By 1990, the television landscape had changed and a number of the stronger programs saw opportunities for better deals outside of the CFA. Notre Dame left the CFA and sold their home game broadcast rights to NBC.[tpl]cite news|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|title= COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Notre Dame Scored a $38 Million Touchdown on Its TV Deal|work=New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|date=1991-08-25|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0D91038F936A1575BC0A967958260 |accessdate=2008-04-06[/tpl]
When the Southeastern Conference invited the University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina to join in 1990, it created shockwaves across the CFA. The other CFA conferences correctly assumed the SEC made these additions to create a better TV product with the idea of leaving the CFA.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The SEC represented one of the more valuable CFA assets.  It seemed likely that if the SEC departed, the other conferences could have difficulty securing good TV deals.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
After Arkansas' departure from the Southwest Conference, the SWC and Big Eight Conference recognized they were in a poor position. The SEC, with about 18% of the nation's TV audience, had a very strong TV position. The Big 8 had an 8.1% share.  The Texas based SWC had an even weaker hand with only 6.7%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.texasalmanac.com/topics/sports/look-back-southwest-conference|title=A Look Back at the Southwest Conference|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=December 13, 2013[/tpl]
In February 1994, the Southeastern Conference announced that they would be leaving the CFA and negotiate independently for a television deal that covered SEC schools only.  This led The Dallas Morning News to proclaim that "the College Football Association as a television entity is dead".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/335883/SEC-OFFICIALLY-LEAVES-CFA-BIG-EAST-WILL-FOLLOW-SOON.html?pg=all | title=SEC OFFICIALLY LEAVES CFA; BIG EAST WILL FOLLOW SOON | work=The Dallas Morning News | date=February 12, 1994 | accessdate=August 25, 2012 | author=Maisel, Ivan[/tpl]  In 1995, the SEC and the Big East broke from the CFA, signing a national deal with CBS.  The SEC would earn a staggering $95 million from the deal.  More significantly, this change in television contracts ultimately would lead to significant realignment of college conferences.

====The Southwest Conference====

For decades the Southwest Conference (SWC) was one of the most dominant football conferences in America. It was seen as a football peer to other elite conferences like the Pac-10, Big 10, SEC and Big Eight.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=IiwEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA5|title=The Decline and fall of the southwest conference|author=Paul Burka|publisher=Texas Monthy|date=September 1974|accessdate=December 14, 2013[/tpl]
Then professional football came to Dallas and Houston. Attendance at Rice, SMU, TCU, and Houston collapsed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leatherheadsofthegridiron.com/?p=3905|title=Essay to the Old Southwest Conference; Reflections on the "New" SWC|publisher=leatherheadsofthegridiron.com|accessdate=December 13, 2013[/tpl]  For over two decades, the SWC membership struggled with the issue. In 1974 a lengthy article detailing the revenue collapse at Rice, Houston, SMU, and TCU and suggested it would lead to a collapse of the historic conference. The conference collapsed in 1994.
The three programs with the strongest fan support, University of Texas-Austin, University of Arkansas, and Texas A&M resented having to play less lucrative games in conference in front of very small crowds. Further every time a team went to a bowl game, the lion's share of the revenue was given to the schools who did not go. The big three were subsidizing the conference and began to voice their frustration in the media.
In response to these pressures, the SWC schools with the smaller budgets felt a more pressing need to win to keep fans coming in. They began paying top players to come to their schools. In the 1980s most of the SWC schools spent time on probation for rule violations. SMU was given the death penalty for their rule violations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SWC.pdf|title=The Break-Up of the Southwest Conference|publisher=http://houstonhistorymagazine.org|author=Auston Fertak|accessdate=December 13, 2013[/tpl]
By 1986, SWC schools' NCAA penalties and bowl game ineligibilities had begun compromise the SWC brand, driving top Texas talent out of state. Even top schools that had mostly stayed clear of trouble found their recruiting diminished. After years of SWC schools doing well in bowls, they suddenly could not compete with the elite schools of other conferences.  A December 18, 1986 Dallas Morning News article stated:
"Recruiting experts say the allegations have chased Texas's home-grown talent to other conferences. And while other conferences raid the state, the SWC stays at home, making do with a shrinking talent pool. Earlier this month, seven of the Dallas area`s leading recruits—including running back Barry Foster of nearby Duncanville, Texas, The Dallas Morning News' Offensive Player of the Year—said they no longer were interested in the SWC, calling it 'shaky' or 'screwed-up.' Said Bennie Perry, a defensive back from Bryan Adams High School in Dallas: 'You couldn`t pay me to go to a Southwest Conference school, because they`re getting into too much trouble.'"

As sanctions began to sap the quality of play at the top of the conference, The big three began to actively look at other conferences.  In attempts to appease the conference powers, the other members made financial rule changes, eventually including allowing home teams to keep their gate revenue (Gate revenue was a much larger portion of operating funds at that time). These efforts fell short of satisfying the bigger issues UT and Texas A&M had with the SWC, but would appear to have played a role in UT's position going forward on revenue sharing.
Eventually, Arkansas departed for the Southeastern Conference. The SEC comprised primarily rural public schools that drew well and the conference had a much larger share of the nation's TV markets. As game day attendance and TV revenue drove athletic budgets, The SEC represented a much more financially sound organization.
UT Athletic director DeLoss Dodds reflected on the importance of Arkansas' departure saying, “What had to happen, was there had to be a crisis for change.” [tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsminorityreport.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-greatest-realignment-articles-i.html|title=THE DEMISE OF THE SOUTHWEST CONFERENCE |author=Mark Wagrin|date=September 14, 2005|publisher=mysanantonio.com|accessdate=December 2, 2013[/tpl]
Arkansas' athletic director Frank Broyles said that he was encouraged to leave by UT's and Texas A&M's leaders, because it would destabilize the conference, allowing them to do the same. The leaderships at UT and Texas A&M believed they would never be allowed to leave first. (In the summer of 1990, word would leak of Texas and Texas A&M thinking of following Arkansas into the SEC. Reaction in Texas would be very negative, with politicians threatening both schools' funding before the idea was tabled.)
The Southwest Conference could not find a replacement its membership would agree upon. The private schools were in denial of the depth of problems facing the conference. They suggested simply replacing Arkansas, a public school, with private schools BYU or Tulane. With four private schools and four public schools already in the SWC, adding either choice could potentially give the private schools a voting majority.
Private or not, UT and Texas A&M were dead set against replacing Arkansas. The NCAA sanctions and Arkansas' departure made the conference appear broken to fans in Texas. Texas and Texas A&M's leaderships felt the conference was inherently flawed, with too many mouths to feed off too few TVs. Adding a single school was not going to change that dynamic, it would only create the public perception of a healed conference and prolong UT and Texas A&M's suffering.

===="Predatory" conferences====

Around 1993, the Big Ten explored adding Kansas, Missouri and Rutgers, or other potential schools, to create a 14-team league with two divisions.[tpl]cite news | title = Kansas, Big 10 a good fit? | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-12-10/sports/9312100144_1_commissioner-jim-delany-big-southwest-missouri | accessdate = 2009-11-10 | work=Chicago Tribune | first=Ed | last=Sherman | date=1993-12-10[/tpl]
In the early 1990s, Texas had discussions with the Pac-10, a conference with similar academic views. An affiliation with the Pac-10 appealed to UT leaders. Former UT president Robert Berdahl told Mark Wagrin of the San Antonio Express-News “Texas wanted desperately the academic patina that the Pac 10 yielded... To be associated with UCLA, Stanford and Cal in academics was very desirable.”  The Pac-10 wanted to add UT and the University of Colorado. For some reason, an offer didn't come until after the formation of the Big 12.[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-22/sports/sp-11960_1_big-boost | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Elliott | last=Almond | title=Colorado Is Invited Into Pac-10 : Colleges: Regents will meet today to consider the offer that has McCartney and others who favor the Big 12 upset | date=December 22, 1994[/tpl]
Some reports state the Stanford refused to vote to admit UT in an effort to protect the Cardinal's conference dominance in non-revenue sports. (The Pac-10 required unanimous votes for expansion.)
(At the end of 1994, UT's Athletic Director Deloss Dodds, as he was turning down the Pac-10, stated that the Pac-10 leadership informed UT they would have a standing invitation for the Longhorns. What is unclear, is when the Pacific-10 made that offer, although Dodds did use the word "always" in describing the offer.)Colorado Mulls Joining Pac-10 - Philly.com
One report stated that the offer was changed to UT and Texas A&M.  UT reportedly tried to carry Texas A&M with them into the Big 10.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=pysEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA68|title=New Ball Game|author=Paul Burka|date=September 1991|publisher=Texas Monthly|accessdate=December 14, 2013[/tpl] No evnidence confirms Pac-10 support for that idea. This change allegedly upset the leadership at Colorado and drove them to take a more active role in protecting the Big Eight. (Colorado's Chancellor James Corbridge was also the Big Eight chairman.  He was very involved with the TV negotiations for the new conference and the integration of the Texas schools.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-23/sports/sp-12212_1_southwest-conference|title=Colorado Votes to Stay in Big 12 : Colleges: Pacific 10 Conference is rebuffed in attempt to expand.|author=ELLIOTT ALMOND|date=December 23, 1994|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=December 2, 2013[/tpl])
UT then approached the Big 10, but was turned down, because the conference had recently instituted a moratorium on expansion.
Texas then turned to the SEC, and negotiations reach an advanced stage. UT abruptly withdrew after concluding that the SEC had no interest in strengthening academics. Berdahl said, “We were quite interested in raising academic standards... And the Southeastern Conference had absolutely no interest in that.”
Texas A&M had flirted with the SEC since the late 1980s. In 1993, it had approached the conferencce about joining, partnered with the University of Houston, but the SEC did not consider Houston a good enough candidate and passed. UT had given up on the SEC and Texas A&M's leadership didn't want to try leaving the SWC on their own. The SEC moved expansion plans to the backburner.
Then UT's interests turned to the Big Eight.  Texas and Oklahoma's leaders both looked favorably on the idea of being in the same conference, but both schools had other options. Former Kansas State University president Jon Wefald voiced fears that if UT had joined the Pac-10, there would be no way for the Big Eight to ramp up their TV payouts in order to keep Oklahoma from joining the SEC for more lucrative TV payouts.Bill Cunningham - Big 12 Blog - ESPN

====Negotiations with Texas and other schools====

The Big Eight had been in pursuit of some kind of alliance with the Southwest Conference since Arkansas's departure destabilized that historic conference.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The Big Eight and SWC members saw the potential financial benefits from an alliance to negotiate television deals, but a true alliance of 16 teams which would retain the seven other SWC schools was not viewed as optimal by UT. Dodds and the Longhorn leadership viewed proposals of this sort as continuing business as usual in the SWC. Arkansas's departure allowed UT and Texas A&M to clear four or more less profitable dates from their football schedules and eight or more from their basketball schedules.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
For years the Big Eight could not interest UT in a merger.  Without Texas to ensure the retention of Oklahoma, the Big Eight was not interested.[tpl]clarify|date=March 2014[/tpl]

====Texas politicians ban====

After the SEC announced their intent to leave the CFA, the Big 8 and SWC members re-opened discussions to sell their rights together. "The Baylor Project" by Barry G. Hankins and Donald D. Schmeltekoff (page 68) states that on February 11, 1994, SWC member schools' leaders met a few Big 8 leaders in Dallas to discuss potentially selling both leagues' media content in a package deal. Discussions broke down on February 16, reportedly over UT's interest in the Pac-10. The Big Eight began negotiating a deal that would not include the full SWC as a partner and Texas A&M approached the SEC.
In Texas, word leaked out that UT & Texas A&M were close to leaving the SWC; UT to the Pac-10 or Big Eight and eventually Texas A&M to the SEC. Texas state senator David Sibley, a Baylor alumnus and member of the very powerful Senate Finance Committee, approached UT Chancellor Bill Cunningham and asked him pointedly whether UT planned to leave the SWC on its own for the Big Eight.  Cunningham tried to change the subject. Ultimately he did not deny it.
Sibley approached LT Governor Bob Bullock, a Texas Tech and Baylor alumnus. Texas state senator John Montford of Lubbock was equally motivated to protect Texas Tech's path to the Big 12. The trio put together a group of legislators who worked to threaten Texas and Texas A&M's access to the state of Texas's Permanent University Fund.
Bullock called together a meeting of supportive legislators as well as UT's and Texas A&M's leaders on February 20, 1994.Q&A: Former UT System Chancellor William Cunningham talks money, power and politics | Dallas Morning News UT Chancellor William Cunningham admitted that Texas planned to join the Big Eight and A&M's leadership still targeted the SEC.
A deal was worked out where all four schools would go together to the Big 12. A&M was convinced not to pursue SEC membership (LSU was prepared to sponsor the Aggies) in return for Bullock finding the votes to approve the construction of Reed Arena. Baylor and Texas Tech would join the Aggies in coming with UT into the new version of the Big Eight.
Texas's Governor Ann Richards, a Baylor and UT alumna, is often credited with getting Baylor included, but, was absent from the February 20 meeting and no investigative reports confirm her active involvement. The Baylor Report claimed that she presented herself as neutral. Richards' former Chief of Staff, John Fainter, is on record saying "She just was not involved to any great degree in working that out...I'd have to say she was informed, but she wasn't pounding the table or anything like that."  Richards was aware of the public perception of her involvement and the thought amused her.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baylorfans.com/forums/showthread.php?t=107045|title=How Baylor got into the Big 12 |author=BRIAN DAVIS|date=August 30, 2006|publisher=The Dallas Morning News|accessdate=December 2, 2013[/tpl])
UT officials informed the Big Eight leadership that the Austin school was now receptive to an invitation and the Big Eight issued invitations to Texas, Texas A&M, Baylor, and Texas Tech. All four schools quickly accepted.
At the time of the deal, Texas politicians denied any coercion took place.  Over the years, investigative reporters challenged that notion. The idea that Bullock and the state government coerced A&M to join and forced UT to take Tech and Baylor to the Big 12 has constantly been downplayed by Cunningham, but former UT president Robert Berdahl claimed that UT was threatened. “As I recall, it wasn't a very veiled threat to cut budgets if Tech was left behind.”
Baylor President Herb Reynolds thanked Bullock and the other politicians for helping Baylor get into the conference. Despite Baylor's strong credentials, clearly Reynolds felt the politicians played a key role in getting the Bears and Texas Tech into the new conference.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.killerfrogs.com/msgboard/index.php?showtopic=140917&p=906835|date=February 24, 1994|publisher=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|accessdate=December 2, 2013[/tpl] The minutes of the February 23, 1994 meeting of the Baylor Board of Regents where the Big 12's invitation was accepted state, "Baylor University owes a strong debt of gratitude to Lt. Governor Bob Bullock, Senator David Sibley, Senator John Montford, Representative Rob Junell, and other legislators for their invaluable assistance during the deliberations leading to the acceptance of the invitations.""The Baylor Project" (page 68)

===Formation===

On February 25, 1994, it was announced that a new conference would be formed from the members of the Big Eight and four of the Texas member colleges of the Southwest Conference.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=B-9LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9OwDAAAAIBAJ&dq=big%2012&pg=7024%2C6649678|title=Politics played big part information of Big 12|date=February 28, 1994|publisher=The Deseret News|accessdate=June 20, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Texas Giants Merge With Big 8 |agency= Associated Press |publisher= The Nevada Daily Mail, via Google News |date= February 27, 1994 |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1zkwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_N8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=5906,3123357&dq=big+8+southwest+conference&hl=en [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Presidents Decide on Name: Big 12 |agency= Associated Press |publisher= Lawrence Journal-World, via Google News |date= May 13, 1994 |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=10YyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7eYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1935,4801791&dq=big+12+conference+big+8+southwest+conference&hl=en [/tpl] Though the name would not be made official for several months, newspaper accounts immediately dubbed the new entity the "Big 12".[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=B-9LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9OwDAAAAIBAJ&dq=big%2012&pg=7024%2C6649678 | title=Politics played big part in formation of Big 12 | date=February 28, 1994 | accessdate=August 26, 2012[/tpl] Charter members of the Big 12 included: Baylor University, the University of Colorado at Boulder, Iowa State University, University of Kansas, Kansas State University, the University of Missouri, the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma State University–Stillwater, the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University and Texas Tech University.
Three months after formation, the schools of the new conference officially announced the conference's name: the Big 12 Conference. Conference competition commenced on August 31, 1996.
Seven cities were considered for the conference's headquarters including:Colorado Springs, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City (the former headquarters of the Big Eight), Lubbock, Texas, Oklahoma City, and Omaha, Nebraska before Dallas suburb Irving, Texas was chosen.[tpl]cite news |title=City Dangles Incentives to Lure Big 12 Office |first=Chris |last=Van-Wagenen |newspaper=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |date=1995-11-11 |page=1A[/tpl]
From the conference's formation until the 2010–11 season, the Big 12 was split into two divisions for football.  The Oklahoma and Texas schools formed the South Division, while the six northernmost schools formed the North Division.

===Pac-10===

The Pacific-10 Conference unanimously voted to offer memberships to UT and Colorado at the end of 1994,[tpl]when|date=December 2013[/tpl] but UT declined, and the CU Regents also rejected the offer in a 6-3 vote,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/394655/COLORADO-REJECTS-PAC-10-OFFER-STAYS-IN-BIG-12.html|title=COLORADO REJECTS PAC-10 OFFER, STAYS IN BIG 12|author=Doug Tucker|date=December 23, 1994 |publisher=Deseret News|accessdate=December 2, 2013[/tpl] opting to stay in the new Big 12.

===Future expansion===

The four Southwest Conference schools were not the only candidates the Big Eight considered. After the Big 12 was founded, leaks in 1994 claimed that the conference also had a plan for a 14 team membership in order to secure a larger TV share than the SEC, something some of the conference leadership felt might be vital for its future TV negotiations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/338400/LATEST-RUMOR-BIG-EIGHT-TARGETS-Y-NEW-MEXICO.html?pg=all|title=LATEST RUMOR: BIG EIGHT TARGETS Y., NEW MEXICO|last=Burch|first=Jimmy|date=February 24, 1994|publisher=The Deseret News|accessdate=June 20, 2012[/tpl]
Reports confirmed that Brigham Young University and the University of New Mexico, then in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), were actively considered for Big 12 membership and if the conference should then decide to go to 16 schools, the University of Louisville and the University of Memphis would be favorites to fill those slots.  In anticipation of the possibility of expansion to 14 by 1996, the new conference trademarked both "Big 12" and "Big 14".[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=B-9LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9OwDAAAAIBAJ&dq=big%2012&pg=4801%2C6649676|title='Big 14' would need 2 BYUs|last=Burch|first=Jimmy|date=February 28, 1994|publisher=The Deseret News|accessdate=June 20, 2012[/tpl] The idea was that BYU and New Mexico would raise the conference footprint to 20% of the nation's TV households while also giving the northern division another football powerhouse in BYU.  Articles of the day suggested support for the idea was not uniform among Big 12 schools and many quotes suggested such an expansion discounted the possibility.[tpl]Which|date=December 2013[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
UNM's athletic director Rudy Davalos, former athletic director at the University of Houston, questioned the logic of the Big 12 adding UNM. Davalos publicly expressed a commitment to the WAC. Former Baylor President Herbert H. Reynolds speaks of making the case to his board that much of the value of the Big 12 for Baylor arose from the Waco university being the only private school in the conference."The Baylor Project" (page 73)
TCU's AD at the time, Frank Windegger was told by colleagues that TCU was discussed as a package deal with BYU, with the idea even going to a vote --- but the expansion vote was narrowly defeated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baylorfans.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-92184.html|title=Breakup still stings the TCU faithful|author=DAMIEN PIERCE|date=November 27, 2005|publisher=The Fort Worth Star Telegram |accessdate=December 2, 2013[/tpl]
Ultimately the conference chose to stay at 12 members. BYU's athletic director Clayne Jensen told the press that while the addition of BYU could likely pay for the Cougars' admission as the conference's 13th member, it appeared no other candidate school made financial sense to allow to become the 14th member.
The greater influence held by the schools in the southern division would later be cited repeatedly as a key component in Nebraska's eventual decision to leave.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Conference realignment===

During the 2010–13 NCAA conference realignment, the Big 12 was one of the more heavily impacted. Persistent rumors of the Pac-10 and Big Ten targeting key members created unease and suspicion. Questions about TV contracts and dissatisfaction with the Big 12's policy of unequal revenue sharing created more conflict. This erosion of trust allowed other conferences to raid the Big 12.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The Big 12 lost four members between 2010 and 2013, replaced by two others. Remaining below 12 members would end the Big 12's divisional format, as the NCAA only allows football championship games in conferences with at least twelve teams.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Following these departures, the Conference chose to retain the "Big 12" name and logo despite dropping to ten schools,BIG 12 CONFERENCE NEWS a marketing decision similar to the Big Ten Conference's choice to keep its name after its membership increased to 14 with the additions of Maryland and Rutgers. This decision by the Big 12 reminded fans of the near collapse of the conference in the realignment period and to suggest the limited expansion options facing the conference.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

In May 2010, reports speculated that the Big 12 Conference was on the verge of dissolution. In February, reports stated the desire by the Pac-10 to expand the conference.

During the Big 12 meetings in June, the Pac-10 was rumored to be on the verge of inviting Colorado, Texas, Texas A&M, Texas Tech, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State to join them.[tpl]cite web|last=Hinton |first=Matt |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/blog/dr_saturday/post/Report-Pac-10-to-strike-first-with-blockbuster-?urn=ncaaf-245537 |title=Report: Pac-10 to strike first with blockbuster bid for half the Big 12 – Dr. Saturday – NCAAF Blog – Yahoo! Sports |publisher=Rivals.yahoo.com [/tpl]
The Pac-10 had tried to land Texas and Colorado in 1994. This new offer acknowledged that Texas was unlikely to leave the Big 12 without Oklahoma due to the Red River Rivalry' importance to UT's athletic budget. Both schools had in-state rival schools that needed to be included.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Although The Pac-10's attempt bears a number of similarities to the Big 8's raid of the SWC, fans of the targeted Texas schools were resistant. This suggested that the Pac-10 leadership did a poor job of selling the benefits of Pac-10 membership. The Pac-12 was considered too distant for many fans. In contrast, Big 12 concerns about travel distance tended to originate from Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston, cities whose schools were to be excluded.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Rumors that the Big Ten was interested in Texas also emerged.[tpl]cite web|last=Hinton |first=Matt |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/blog/dr_saturday/post/Today-s-hypothetical-Big-Ten-expansion-scenario-?urn=ncaaf-241890 |title=Today's hypothetical Big Ten expansion scenario: Goin' South – Dr. Saturday – NCAAF Blog – Yahoo!

=====Unequal revenue=====

One point of contention in the Big 12 was the unequal distribution of TV revenue, as was common in most other top conferences. Nebraska, Texas, Texas A&M, and Oklahoma objected to equal sharing, according to former Commissioner Dan Beebe. Four votes gave them the ability to block revenue sharing votes. After his 2011 firing, Beebe said that Oklahoma, Nebraska, and even Texas A&M were interested in "developing their own distribution systems" for sports programs.http://www.kansascity.com/2011/10/09/3196648/dan-beebe-says-big-12-now-taking.html[tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl]

=====Raids begin=====

On June 5, a movement was reportedly building in Texas to force the Pac-10 to invite Baylor instead of Colorado. This would give Texas a solid voting block of 4 Texas schools and two strongly aligned Oklahoma schools.Deadline given to Nebraska to decide its B12 fate Baylor trying to push Colorado out of Pac-10 expansion - The Denver Post The Pac-10 quickly eliminated that possibility by modifying their original offer (a package deal for all six schools) to be a standalone offer for Colorado and a package deal for the other five.Colorado knocking Baylor out of Pac-10?

=====June 14 agreement=====

On June 14, the Big 12 announced a deal to save the conference.[tpl]cite web|title=Texas move helps Big 12 survive|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=5286672|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=August 14, 2011[/tpl] Lobbying by Baylor, Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State and Missouri, supported by pressure from other programs who did not want elite conferences to become 16-team "superconferences". The deal required a restructured revenue sharing agreement that guaranteed Oklahoma, Texas, and Texas A&M $20 million each per year (the other schools would split the rest) and an unexpectedly lucrative television deal if the conference stayed together.[tpl]cite web|last=Wetzel|first=Dan|title=How the Big 12 was saved|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/news?slug=dw-big12save061410|publisher=rivals.yahoo.com|accessdate=August 14, 2011[/tpl]
With the big three securing payments that more or less matched what they would have received in a Pac-16 and Texas committing to the conference, Oklahoma stayed and Texas A&M's exit was temporarily obscured.
In the 2010 round of realignment, UT had secured a better conference TV deal and a bigger share of that deal and gained what Dodds considered an easier path to the national title game. It also was permitted its own network (the Longhorn Network) and had gotten Nebraska out of the conference.Pigskin Punditry: Only One Winner in the Expansion Game However, the $20 Million payouts did not soothe hard feelings at Texas A&M and Oklahoma.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

====2011====

=====Grant of Rights agreement=====

Following the near disaster in 2010, the other five pushed for a spring vote on a "Grant of Rights" deal that would grant all sports media rights of member schools to the conference. This would make it very difficult for a key school to leave. The proposal needed a 75% majority, but was defeated by Texas, Oklahoma and Texas A&M.College Confidential: Big 12 passed on grant-of-rights proposal last spring but OU now in fold in regard to measure

=====Longhorn Network=====

ESPN planned to launch the Longhorn Network and to include Texas High School football games. Oklahoma and Texas A&M objected that doing so would create a recruiting advantage for the Longhorns. Texas A&M went so far as to accuse Texas of violating NCAA rules.Texas A&M goes to NCAA on Longhorn Network - CBSSports.com NCAA summons Texas officials, others to talk TV
Oklahoma and Texas A&M had agreed to allow the Longhorn Network in exchange for the $20 Million guarantees in 2010, but in 2011, the reality of the network proved unacceptable. Texas A&M wanted to convince the state that Dodds and Texas were unfaithful conference partners. They created animosity between Texas and Texas A&M fans and sympathy with the unaffiliated Texas masses to allow the Aggies to escape the Big 12 for their long-preferred home, the SEC.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
In addition to a non-conference game each season, ESPN wanted a Big 12 Conference game on the Longhorn Network. At the same Big 12 meeting discussing high school football broadcasts, it was agreed that a conference game would be acceptable as long as both schools and the conference office approved the broadcast.Big 12 sets up restrictions on Longhorn Network, Houston Chronicle, retrieved 1 August 2011
It was reported that ESPN asked Texas Tech for permission to broadcast their November 5 game against the Longhorns on the network. ESPN told the university that the game would most likely not be carried on an ESPN network, leaving LHN as the only option. In return, ESPN promised to televise two non-conference football games over the next four seasons, broadcast some other non-football programming, $5 million cash and help from the network to try to arrange a home-and-home series against a top BCS conference school. Texas Tech passed on the offer, explaining, "I don't want a Tech fan to have to give one dime to the Longhorn Network".Tech says no to Longhorn Network, Amarillo Globe-News, retrieved 9 August 2011
ESPN then contacted Oklahoma State, without success. Texas Athletics eventually announced that the Kansas Jayhawks had agreed to let their game against the Longhorns on October 29 be shown on the network (KU's third tier media rights are also managed by LHN co-owner IMG College). The agreement allowed the Longhorn Network to be the national carrier of the game except in Kansas markets, where the game was shown on local network affiliates.Texas-Kansas football game to air on Longhorn Network, TexasSports.com, retrieved 2 September 2011

=====Texas A&M=====

In August 2011, A&M announced plans to apply to join an unspecified conference.

With no prospect of Pac-12 membership, Oklahoma and Texas's positions changed dramatically and preserving the Big 12 became those schools' primary goal. Missouri and Oklahoma in particular would play a leadership role in stabilizing the Big 12. On September 23, Missouri Chancellor Brady Deaton, the Chairman of the Big 12 Board of Directors, announced that the conference presidents agreed in principle to pursue granting member school media rights to the conference. Oklahoma's President David Boren called the agreement "'essential' for the league’s future". UT's Deloss Dodds had opposed the idea saying, "UT officials 'don’t want to sign over' any TV rights to the league", the day before all the league's presidents (including UT's) endorsed the idea.
The same day, the Big 12 announced the departure of Commissioner Dan Beebe, who was seen as dominated by Texas, replaced by Interim commissioner Chuck Neinas, a former Big Eight commissioner.Beebe out as Big 12 commissioner | NCAA.com Neinas took over on October 3.Interim commissioner Chuck Neinas aims for a 'closer' Big 12 - ESPN

With the loss of Texas A&M and its Aggie fan base, the conference thought there was now a need/opening for another Texas school. While the TCU fan base was significantly smaller, TCU was in a good location. With the SEC now having a significant Texas presence, adding Dallas/Fort Worth-based TCU made sense in terms of protecting the other Texas and Oklahoma schools' access to DFW-area recruiting.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

=====Missouri leaves=====

By rushing the addition of the Aggies, the SEC had created a two division, 13 team conference for 2012.

==Distinctive elements==

===No championship game===

The Big 12 is unique among the five conferences formerly known as 'contract conferences' in the late BCS/realignment era in that it only has 10 members. Twelve or more members are required for a conference championship game. (The Pacific-12 and Big Ten has 12 members have 12 members, the ACC and SEC have 14 football members each.)
Dodds and Brown, along with Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops, preferred not to have a championship game.[tpl]cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/campusrivalry/post/2010/06/big-12-still-deciding-on-future-of-conference-title-game-scheduling/1#.Uq44x8qfglQ | work=USA Today | title=Big 12 still deciding on future of conference title game, scheduling | date=June 15, 2010[/tpl] Critics argued it was a competitive advantage over other contract conferences. Conferences with a championship game have their division champions play one of their toughest games of the year on the last week of the regular season.

===Population base===

Like the Southwest Conference, the Big 12 footprint has a small population base. It has the smallest population base by far of the contract conferences. Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, West Virginia and Iowa have a combined population of 37.8 Million. As of 2013, there are only 13,427,130 TV households in those states13,427,130 TV households in those states (although West Virginia's support is very strong in the western half of neighboring Pennsylvania).
As of 2013, the US had 115.6 Million TV households.115.6 households in US The Big 12 footprint included only 8.6% of the total.
The Big 12's share of the nation's TVs is a fraction of that reached by the other contract conferences. This likely works against the conference in TV negotiations, but the conference negotiated tier 1 and 2 TV contracts in the same ballpark as other contract conferences.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=5286816 |title=Big 12 Conference: Influential people saved league - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl]

===Grant of rights===

Member schools granted their first and second tier sports media rights to the conference for the length of their current TV deals.  The Grant of Rights (GOR) deal with the leagues' TV contracts ensures that "if a Big 12 school leaves for another league in the next 13 years, that school's media rights, including revenue, would remain with the Big 12 and not its new conference."[tpl]cite web|last=Ubben |first=David |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/54878/big-12-cements-future-wallets-and-revival |title=Big 12 extends rights deal, cementing future - Big 12 Blog - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl]
GOR is seen by league members as a "foundation of stability" and allowed the Big 12 to be "positioned with one of the best media rights arrangements in collegiate sports, providing the conference and its members unprecedented revenue growth, and sports programming over two networks." All members agreed to the GOR and later agreed to extend the initial 6 year deal to 13 years to correspond to the length of their TV contracts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/sports/college/by-signing-away-tv-rights-horns-offer-stability--1/nRn93/ |title=By signing away TV rights, Horns offer stability to Big 12 |publisher=www.statesman.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl]
Prior to this agreement, the Big Ten and Pac-12 also had similar GOR agreements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/09/07/report-big-12-tv-announcement-coming-friday |title=Updated: Big 12 TV deal made official | CollegeFootballTalk |publisher=Collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl] The Big 12 subsequently assisted the ACC in drafting its GOR agreement.[tpl]cite web|author=Chuck Carlton |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/college-sports/headlines/20130525-carlton-a-year-into-big-12-tenure-bob-bowlsby-has-seen-conference-stabilize-but-won-t-rest-on-his-laurels.ece |title=Carlton: A year into Big 12 tenure, Bob Bowlsby has seen conference stabilize, but won't rest on his laurels | Dallas Morning News |publisher=Dallasnews.com |date=2013-05-25 |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl] Four of the five major conferences now have such agreements, with the SEC the only exception.

===Tier 3 events===

The Big 12 is the only major conference that allows members to monetize TV rights for tier 3 events.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] This allows individual Big 12 member institutions to create tier 3 deals that include TV rights for a certain number of football and basketball games as well as other sports. The unique arrangement potentially allows Big 12 members to remain some of college sports' highest revenue earners. Other conferences' cable deals are subject to value reductions based on how people acquire cable programming, Big 12 schools tier 3 deals are exempt. Big 12 members individual existing and pending tier 3 deals are expected to bring in an additional $300 to $400 million over their life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=205681088 |title=A Year Later, Big 12 Is Stronger Than Ever - Big 12 Conference - Official Athletic Site |publisher=Big12sports.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl] UT alone will earn more than $150 Million of that total from their Longhorn Network.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thebiglead.com/2011/08/08/longhorn-network-contract-between-texas-and-espn-revealed-big-12-future-not-bright/ |title=Longhorn Network Contract Between Texas and ESPN Revealed, Big 12 Future Not Bright |publisher=The Big Lead |date=2011-08-08 |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl]

==Revenue==

Conference revenue comes mostly from television contracts, bowl games, the NCAA, merchandise, licensing and conference-hosted sporting events. The Conference distributes revenue annually to member institutions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/2094/how-the-big-12-teams-rank-in-revenue-sharing-funds |title=How the Big 12 teams rank in revenue-sharing funds  |publisher=ESPN |author=Griffin, Tim |date=May 26, 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100516030428/http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/2094/how-the-big-12-teams-rank-in-revenue-sharing-funds| archivedate= May 16, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] From 1996 to 2011, 57 percent of revenue was allotted equally; while 43 percent was based upon the number of football and men's basketball television appearances and other factors.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=106137&SPID=13138&DB_OEM_ID=10410&ATCLID=205157134 |title=Sharing A Bright Future |publisher=Big 12 Conference |date=June 3, 2011 |accessdate=2011-06-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/topstories/stories/060610dnspobig12sider2.112db5e.html |title=Big 12 problems trace to league's roots |work=The Kansas City Star |author=Kerkhoff, Blair |date=June 5, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100608123730/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/topstories/stories/060610dnspobig12sider2.112db5e.html| archivedate= June 8, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In 2011 the distribution was 76 percent equal and 24 percent based on television appearances. Changing the arrangement requires a unanimous vote; as a Big 12 member, Nebraska had withheld support for more equitable revenue distribution.
With this model, larger schools can receive more revenue because they appear more often on television. In 2006, for example, Texas received $10.2 million, 44% more than Baylor University's $7.1 million.[tpl]cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/2094/how-the-big-12-teams-rank-in-revenue-sharing-funds |title=How the Big 12 teams rank in revenue-sharing funds |publisher=ESPN.com |author=Griffin, Tim |date=2009-05-26 |accessdate=2013-06-01[/tpl]
Big 12 revenue is generally less than other BCS conferences; this was due in part to television contracts signed with Fox Sports Net (four years for $48 million) and ABC/ESPN (eight years for $480 million).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2010/jun/03/tv-is-big-12s-shot-at-curbing-grazing/ |title=TV is Big 12’s shot at curbing grazing |work=Columbia Daily Tribune |author=Matter, Dave |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-06[/tpl]

==Football==

The first football game in conference play was the 1996 Texas Tech vs. Kansas State football game, won by Kansas State, 21–14.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_game_by_game.php?coachid=2190&year=1996|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|first=David|last=DeLassus|title=Kansas State University football records--1996|accessdate=September 4, 2013[/tpl]
From 1996–2010, Big 12 Conference teams played eight conference games a season. Each team faced all five opponents within its own division and three teams from the opposite division. Inter-divisional play was a "three-on, three-off" system, where teams would play three teams from the other division on a home-and-home basis for two seasons, and then play the other three foes from the opposite side for a two-year home-and-home.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
This format came under considerable criticism, especially from Nebraska and Oklahoma, who were denied a yearly match between two of college football's most storied programs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] The Nebraska-Oklahoma rivalry was one of the most intense in college football history.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] (Until 2006, the teams had never met in the Big 12 Championship.) Due to the departure of Nebraska and Colorado in 2011, the Big 12 eliminated the divisions (and championship game) and instituted a nine-game round-robin format.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]

===Championship game===

The game was approved by all members except Nebraska.[tpl]cite news |title=Big 12 approves playoff format |publisher=Harlan Daily Enterprise, via Google News |location=Harlan, Kentucky |agency=Associated Press |date=June 16, 1995 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SS5BAAAAIBAJ&sjid=06gMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6967,2386120&dq=big-12+kansas-city+headquarters+irving&hl=en [/tpl] The championship game pitted the division champions against each other after the regular season was completed. The first match was held during the 1996 season at the Trans World Dome in St. Louis.
Following the 2008 game, a decision was made to move the game to the new Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas.

===Rivalries===

Rivalries (primarily in football) mostly predate the conference. The Kansas-Missouri rivalry was the longest running, the longest west of the Mississippi and the second longest in college football. It was played 119 times before Missouri left the Big 12. As of October 2012, the University of Kansas' athletic department had not accepted Missouri's invitations to play inter-conference rivalry games, putting the rivalry on hold. Sports clubs sponsored by the two universities continued to play each other.[tpl]cite web|title=Border Showdown Continues|url=http://mizzoumag.missouri.edu/2012/07/border-showdown-continues/|accessdate=2012-10-23[/tpl] The Oklahoma-Texas rivalry was a major rivalry decades before they were both in the conference.

==Men's basketball==

From 1996–2011, standings in conference play were not split among divisions, although the schedule was structured as if they were. Teams played a home-and-home against teams within their "division"s and a single game against teams from the opposite division for a total of 16 conference games. This denied Oklahoma and Oklahoma State, formerly in the Big Eight, two rivalry games per season, but did allow most of the other traditional rivalries to be played home-and-home. After Nebraska and Colorado left, Big 12 play transitioned to an 18-game, double round robin schedule, allowing Oklahoma and Oklahoma State to once again play their rivals twice each season, in addition to adding second annual games to lucrative, nationally prominent series such as Texas-Kansas.[tpl]cite web|title=Men's Basketball – 2011–2012 Schedule & Results-All Teams full season schedule|url=http://www.big12sports.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10410&SPID=13134&SPSID=106112&Q_SEASON=2011&CONF_SCHOOL_ID=&SCHEDULE_MONTH=-1|work=Big 12 official Website|accessdate=October 4, 2011[/tpl]

===Conference champions===

Kansas has the most Big 12 titles, winning or sharing the regular-season title 14 times in the league's 18 seasons. The 2002 Jayhawks became the first, and so far only, team to complete an undefeated Big 12 regular season, going 16–0. Following the 2014 season, Kansas had won or shared 10 straight regular-season league titles and 12 of the past 13.
In 2005, Oklahoma won the post-season tournament seeding tiebreaker over Kansas based on its 71–63 victory over the Jayhawks.
In 2006, Texas won the post-season tournament seeding tiebreaker over Kansas based on its 80–55 victory over the Jayhawks.

In 2008, Texas won the post-season tournament seeding tiebreaker over Kansas based on its 72–69 victory over the Jayhawks.
