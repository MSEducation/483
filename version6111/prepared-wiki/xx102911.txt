==Background==

The album title Lullabies to Paralyze was intended to bridge Lullabies with its predecessor Songs for the Deaf by naming it after a line in "Mosquito Song", the final track on Songs for the Deaf. The "deluxe limited edition" of the album includes a bonus track and a bonus DVD containing "a look behind the scenes and special bonus footage". Videos were produced for singles "Little Sister", "In My Head" and "Burn the Witch", as well as "Everybody Knows That You Are Insane" and "Someone's in the Wolf".QOTSA Yahoo videos The "Everybody Knows That You Are Insane" video was broadcast frequently on MTV during 2005,[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl] while the video for "Someone's in the Wolf" was featured on the bonus DVD of Lullabies to Paralyze.
The album was delayed during 2004 because of some changes to the line-up: bassist, vocalist, and co-songwriter Nick Oliveri was fired and on-off vocalist Mark Lanegan went on tour with his own band.
Lanegan can still be heard singing on several songs of the album as well as contributing lyrics. Because of this turmoil, there had been rumours that Lanegan had left the band, which Josh Homme eventually clarified in several interviews was never the case.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl] Nevertheless he encouraged these rumours to draw the attention off the band by giving the press "something to focus on while I was just making the record".[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl]
[tpl]cquote|And at the time, I was like, "Fuck, no one's even listening to this. It's too much about other stuff." And it would have been easy to make Songs for the Deaf 2, which is basically all I heard in my own head. But I can't do that. You've got to shake all that shit away.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/42335-qotsas-homme-talks-new-lp-motivations-pirates|title=QOTSA's Homme Talks New LP, Motivations, Pirates: interview with Joshua Homme, April 13, 2007[/tpl]|20px|20px|Josh Homme, Pitchfork interview, April 13, 2007[/tpl]

===Outtakes===

===Bonus DVD===

===Limited Tour Edition Bonus UK CD===

Live from Earthlink in Atlanta, GA March 19, 2005.
Most online retailers list the songs on the bonus CD as the March 19, 2005 show in Atlanta, but at least "The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret" and "Regular John" are actually from the show in Washington, DC on March 27, 2005.[tpl]Or|date=September 2007[/tpl]
The final item on the song listing (located behind the CD in the normal version, or inside the booklet in the deluxe edition), below "Long Slow Goodbye" reads:
During that time, the band assumed that the tapes of that song were either lost or stolen. A live version of this song can be found on the DVD release Over the Years and Through the Woods. Homme commented, "The tapes got lost. Actually, they were just at another studio, but we falsely accused everyone in the world of theft."Josh Homme, 09/2005 interview with RollingStone.com

==Personnel==

As common for Queens of the Stone Age recordings, Lullabies does not feature one single line-up but rather a core group of Homme, Castillo and Van Leeuwen that would also form the tour line-up, as well as other contributors, mostly close friends to the band.
