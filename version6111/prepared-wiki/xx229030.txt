[[Tropical Storm Marco (2008)]]

CATEGORIES: 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, 2008 in Mexico, Atlantic hurricanes in Mexico, Atlantic tropical storms

Tropical Storm Marco was the smallest tropical cyclone on record. The thirteenth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Marco developed out of a broad area of low pressure over the northwestern Caribbean during late September 2008. Influenced by a tropical wave on October 4, a small low-level circulation center developed over Belize. After crossing the southern end of the Yucatán Peninsula and emerging into the Bay of Campeche, the low was declared Tropical Depression Thirteen early on October 6. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Marco later that day. Marco reached its peak intensity with winds of [tpl]convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] early on October 7. Around this time, tropical storm force winds extended [tpl]convert|11.5|mi|km[/tpl] from the center of the storm, making Marco the smallest tropical cyclone on record. Around 1200 UTC, Marco made landfall near Misantla, Veracruz. The storm rapidly weakened after landfall, dissipating later that day. Due to its small size, Marco caused minimal damage; however, the storm's heavy rains led to floods up to [tpl]convert|10|ft|m|2[/tpl] deep that covered highways and damaged homes.

==Meteorological history==

Tropical Storm Marco originated in a broad area of low pressure that persisted over the northwestern Caribbean in late September 2008. On October 4, a tropical wave reached the same area, and the system spawned a circulation center over Belize. Development of the low was initially inhibited by its proximity to land. As the system neared the Bay of Campeche, convection quickly developed around the low. At 0000 UTC on October 6, the low was designated as Tropical Depression Thirteen while located over Laguna de Términos.[tpl]cite web|author=James L.

Forecasters anticipated intensification through landfall because of the storm's well-developed outflow and the low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures in its path.[tpl]cite web|author=Richard J.

Favorable conditions for development allowed Marco to quickly intensify throughout the day on October 6. Early on October 7, Marco reached its peak intensity with winds of [tpl]convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=in|sp=us[/tpl] and a minimum pressure of 998 millibar (hPa; 29.47 inHg) . This was based on a reconnaissance mission into Marco which recorded flight-level winds of [tpl]convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] which corresponded to a surface wind speed of [tpl]convert|61|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. Following the quick increase in intensity, forecasters noted the possibility of Marco intensifying into a hurricane before making landfall.[tpl]cite web|author=Richard J.

The small depression dissipated later that day over the mountains of Mexico.
