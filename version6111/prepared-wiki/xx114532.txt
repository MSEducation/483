Stinchcombe is a small village and civil parish in Gloucestershire, England on the B4060 road between Dursley and North Nibley. The church is called St Cyr's and its yard contains 40–60 gravestones.
It gives its name to the nearby Stinchcombe Hill ([tpl]gbmapping|ST7360698151[/tpl]) which is a [tpl]convert| 28.6 |ha|adj=on[/tpl], a nearly detached part of the Cotswold Edge, which was notified as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1966.Natural England SSSI information on citation, map and unit detailStroud District Local Plan, adopted November 2005, Appendix 6 ‘Sites of Nature Conservation Interest’

==Stinchcombe Hill==

Stinchcombe Hill lies west of Dursley and forms part of the Jurassic limestone scarp of the Cotswolds. The site represents the semi-natural calcareous grasslands supporting particular flora and fauna, and particularly a number of rare and uncommon species.
The Hill has a large golf course on the top, and has a public right of way round its edge which is part of the Cotswold Way. (The exact line of the right of way and its interaction with the golf greens has been the subject of some controversy over the years.)

==Views==

The view from Drakestone Point ([tpl]convert|219|m[/tpl] at [tpl]gbmapping|ST737981[/tpl]) over the Vale to the River Severn and Forest of Dean beyond, is particularly fine, but the tranquility is injured by the proximity of the M5 Motorway. Since 1992 volunteers, led by John Smallwood, have done a great deal of work on the Hill, attempting to restore the open views over the Severn Vale. The cleared areas can be seen from the M5, and the Cotswold Way has now been re-routed around the Hill to take advantage of this work.
