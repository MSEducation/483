==History==

Thr ground was opened in May 1890 with a single grandstand on the western touchline, and initially included of a banked running track.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005, Yore Publications, p12, ISBN 0954783042 In 1935 a new 460-seat grandstand was built, and by World War II covered areas had been created on the east and southern sides of the ground.
After the war the running track was replaced by a cycle track. On 27 November 1948 the ground's record attendance of 9,155 was set for an FA Cup first round replay against Hereford United. On 14 September 1955 Aggborough became the first ground to host a floodlit FA Cup match, when they Brierley Hill Alliance in a preliminary round replay, with Kidderminster winning 4-2.
A new East Stand was built in 1979, and terracing was created all around the pitch in 1983. The ground was rebuilt in the 1990s, with the cycle track removed and a new Main Stand built in 1994. Covered terracing was added at each end of the pitch. When Kidderminster won their first Conference title in 1994, Aggborough was not deemed to meet Football League standards and as a result Kidderminster were denied promotion to Division Three. By the time Kidderminster won their second Conference title six years later, the ground had been upgraded to Football League standards and promotion was allowed. In 2003 the new 2,040-seat cantilever stand was built to replace the old East Stand.
