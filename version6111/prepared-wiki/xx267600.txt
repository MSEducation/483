Following the critically acclaimed Gold album Dog Eat Dog the band started to experience frequent changes to the line-up and despite the drop in popularity with the arrival of grunge, they released Ultraphobic in 1995 and a successful best of album in 1996. The band also changed their musical direction with the release of the grunge infested Belly to Belly in 96, but returned to their roots very quickly by the end of the decade. The band experienced highs and lows in the 2000s  with successful tours, a new covers album Under the Influence, lead singer Jani Lane leaving, a brand new Born Again album with new singer Jaime St. James and a brief reunion of the original line up. Into the new decade former lead singer and main songwriter Jani Lane died.
After more than 20 years, the band is still recording music and performing, now with ex-Lynch Mob vocalist, Robert Mason.
Since their debut in 1989, they have released nine studio albums, one live album, three compilation albums, and have issued twenty six singles to radio.
