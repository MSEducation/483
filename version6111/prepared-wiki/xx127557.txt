C. W. McCall & Co. is country musician C. W. McCall's sixth and last album of original songs, released on Polydor Records in 1979 (see 1979 in music), before McCall (or, more accurately, Bill Fries, the man playing his role) announced his retirement from the music industry. Out of the ten tracks, only one ("The Little Things in Life") was written as a collaboration between McCall and Chip Davis, the man responsible for popularizing the distinctive McCall persona, while one other, "Silver Cloud Breakdown", was composed by Davis several years earlier and was featured in the movie Convoy, though it was not present on its soundtrack.
