In set theory, a Woodin cardinal (named for W. Hugh Woodin) is a cardinal number λ such that for all functions
there exists a cardinal κ and an elementary embedding
from the Von Neumann universe V into a transitive inner model M with critical point κ and 
A Woodin cardinal is preceded by a stationary set of measurable cardinals, and thus it is a Mahlo cardinal. However, the first Woodin cardinal is not even weakly compact.

==Consequences==

Woodin cardinals are important in descriptive set theory.  By a resultA Proof of Projective Determinacy of Martin and Steel, existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals implies projective determinacy, which in turn implies that every projective set is measurable, has the Baire property (differs from an open set by a meager set, that is, a set which is a countable union of nowhere dense sets), and the perfect set property (is either countable or contains a perfect subset).

==Hyper-Woodin cardinals==

A cardinal κ is called hyper-Woodin if  there exists a normal measure U on κ such that for every set S, the set 
is in U.  
λ is with 
The name alludes to the classical result that a cardinal is Woodin if and only if for every set S, the set 
is a stationary set
The measure U will contain the set of all Shelah cardinals below κ.

==Weakly hyper-Woodin cardinals==

A cardinal κ is called weakly hyper-Woodin if for every set S there exists a normal measure U on κ such that the set {λ The name alludes to the classic result that a cardinal is Woodin if  for every set S, the set {λ The difference between hyper-Woodin cardinals and weakly hyper-Woodin cardinals is that the choice of U does not depend on the choice of the set S for hyper-Woodin cardinals.
