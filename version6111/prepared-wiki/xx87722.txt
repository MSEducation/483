[[Wynyard railway station, Sydney]]

CATEGORIES: Railway stations in Sydney, Railway stations opened in 1932

Wynyard is a major underground Sydney Trains station in the central business district of Sydney, Australia, 2.05Â km from Central.
Wynyard is the 3rd most patronised railway station in Sydney (out of a total of 176 stations), with an average of 58,040 passengers boarding per day.

==History==

The station opened on 28 February 1932. Wynyard was originally constructed with six platforms (the existing four platforms are still numbered from 3 to 6.) The original intention was that Platforms 1 and 2 would eventually serve the eastern pair of railway tracks across Sydney Harbour Bridge, and in the interim were used as a terminus for North Shore tram services on Sydney's original tram network, a service that operated over those tracks from the bridge's opening in 1932 until 1958. A feature of these lines was Australia's only underground tram terminus. After these tram services were withdrawn, the space occupied by platforms 1 and 2 was converted into the current underground car park, and the eastern tram tracks on the bridge were replaced by two extra road lanes. The disused tunnel and ramp that formerly connected the station to the eastern tram tracks can still be seen, mirroring those still in use to the west of the bridge.
The station was linked to the City Circle on 22 January 1956.

==Station configuration==

Wynyard station currently has two levels, each with two platforms. The upper level serves the North Shore and Northern lines, whilst the lower level serves lines traversing the City Circle. Both lines run south under York Street from Wynyard to Town Hall. There is no connection between the rails of these two lines at Wynyard.
The passenger concourse is on an intermediate level between the upper and lower platforms. Wynyard is connected via underground passageways to several surrounding buildings and shopping arcades and is located immediately below Wynyard Park. Direct access via tunnels is possible to George Street, Hunter Street and Pitt Street. Escalators connect the station concourse with York Street (emerging underneath Transport House) and Carrington Street (under Wynyard Park).  
The station is equipped with Easy Access for wheelchairs.

===Wynyard Walk===

Wynyard Walk is a project to construct a new western pedestrian access to Wynyard station. It will provide improved access to Barangaroo and the western CBD from the station. The project combines a new entrance, a pedestrian tunnel, a pedestrian bridge, and a new pedestrian plaza. At the conclusion of the construction of Wynyard Walk, direct access via tunnels will also be available to Clarence St, Kent St, and Sussex St.  [tpl]Cite web | title = Wynyard Walk | url = http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects-wynyard-walk | publisher = Transport for NSW | accessdate = 2013-07-20 [/tpl]

==Platforms and services==

The station services the Sydney Trains trains of several lines: the North Shore line, the Northern line and the lines served by the City Circle, namely the Bankstown Line, the Airport & East Hills Line, the Inner West Line, and the South Line. Although there were stairs between former Platforms 1 and 2 and platforms 5 and 6 (which are still in existence, although boarded up), the only access between platforms is via the concourse.
The station is served by twelve to sixteen trains per hour each way, with additional trains during weekday peak hours.
