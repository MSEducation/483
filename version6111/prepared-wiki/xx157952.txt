Harry Butsko (Ukrainian: Гері Буцько) (born February 2, 1941 in Pottsville, Pennsylvania) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League for the Washington Redskins.  He played college football at the University of Maryland and was drafted in the 15th round of the 1963 NFL Draft.  Butsko was also selected in the 27th round of the 1963 AFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers.
Harry played his high school football in Cass Township, a small patch near Minersville, PA (Schuylkill County), on the remarkable undefeated, untied, unscored upon 1957 Cass Condor team as a junior.  He was 6 ft 2 inches tall and weighed 200 lbs, which was huge by 1957 standards, and played both offensive and defensive end. He was one of the key players who helped this team go on to become co-champions of the Eastern PA conference. In 1958, as a senior he helped the Cass High football team, coached by the late Pat Droskinis, go another 5 games without being scored upon for a total of 15 straight football games in both '57 and '58 seasons.  Harry was remarkable defensive end, who wore jerseys #21 and #28 in high school.
