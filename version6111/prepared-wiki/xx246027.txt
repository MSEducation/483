[[Migratory aptitude]]

CATEGORIES: Organic chemistry

Migratory aptitude is the relative ability of a migrating group to migrate in a rearrangement reaction. This can be affected by the leaving group (whichever gives a more stable carbocation) and the group that 'stays' (whichever can stabilize the positive charge best).It also depends upon the electron density of the migrating group i.e.
Hydride > tert-alkyl > sec-alkyl = phenyl > primary alkyl > methylhttp://classes.yale.edu/02-03/chem125a/125webSpring/BaeyerVilliger/migratoryaptitude.htm
