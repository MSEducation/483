Glostrup Kommune is a suburban municipality (Danish kommune) and town in Region Hovedstaden on the island of Zealand (Sjælland) approx. 10 km west of Copenhagen in eastern Denmark. The municipality covers an area of 13.31 km², and has a total population of 21,829 (1 October 2012). Its Zip code (Postnummer) is 2600. Its mayor as of 2010 is John Engelhardt, a member of the Liberal Party (Venstre) political party. The municipality was established in 1841 following the municipal reforms of the 1840's, ranking as a parish municipality (sognekommune) until 1950 when suburbanisation of Copenhagen inhabited the municipality and the status was changed to town municipality (købstadskommune). From 1947 to 1960 the population in the municipality doubled due to the expanding suburbs of Copenhagen, reaching the municipality in the post-war period. Glostrup was designated as a new suburb along the western Tåstrup-finger of the Copenhagen Finger Plan of 1947.
The main town and the site of its municipal council is the town of Glostrup, home to three quarters of the population.  Other towns in the municipality are Hvissinge and Ejby.  Until 1974 the town of Avedøre also belonged to this municipality. Being an exclave, it was merged into the neighbouring Hvidovre Municipality.
Neighboring municipalities are Rødovre to the east, Herlev and Ballerup to the north, Albertslund to the west, and Brøndby to the south.
Glostrup was not merged with other municipalities by January 1, 2007 as the result of nationwide Kommunalreformen ("The Municipality Reform" of 2007).
The church of Glostrup originates from the 12th century.

Most of the municipality's housing stock is built between 1950 and 1975. 42 percent of its dwellings are owned by public housing corporations, primarily Glostrup Boligselskab formed by later mayor Valdemar Hansen in 1943. As a result of the influence of the housing corporation, more than half the housing stock is between 60 and 99 square meters.
As a result of the rising population in the Copenhagen area, Glostrup Municipality adopted a strategy in 2011 aiming on building 2000 new dwellings within the next four years. The dwellings are primarily detached houses and terraced houses planned in former industrial areas.http://www.tagec.dk/Boligpolitik%20%20rammen%20om%20det%20gode%20liv%202.pdf
