Positronium (Ps) is a system consisting of an electron and its anti-particle, a positron, bound together into an exotic atom, specifically an onium.  The system is unstable: the two particles annihilate each other to produce two gamma-ray photons after an average lifetime of 125 picoseconds or three gamma-ray photons after 142 nanoseconds in vacuum, depending on the relative spin states of the positron and electron.  The orbit of the two particles and the set of energy levels is similar to that of the hydrogen atom (electron and proton).  However, because of the reduced mass, the frequencies associated with the spectral lines are less than half of those of the corresponding hydrogen lines.

The ground state of positronium, like that of hydrogen, has two possible configurations depending on the relative orientations of the spins of the electron and the positron.  
The singlet state with antiparallel spins (S = 0, Ms = 0) is known as para-positronium (p-Ps) and denoted [tpl]SubatomicParticle|para-positronium[/tpl]. It has a mean lifetime of 125 picoseconds and decays preferentially into two gamma quanta with energy of [tpl]val|511|ul=keV[/tpl] each (in the center-of-mass frame). Detection of these photons allows to reconstruct the vertex of the decay and is used in the positron-emission tomography. Para-positronium can decay into any even number of photons (2, 4, 6, ...), but the probability quickly decreases as the number increases: the branching ratio for decay into 4 photons is [tpl]val|1.439|(2)|e=-6[/tpl].
Para-positronium (S = 0) lifetime in vacuum is
The triplet state with parallel spins (S = 1, Ms = âˆ’1, 0, 1) is known as ortho-positronium (o-Ps) and denoted 3S1.  The triplet state in vacuum has a mean lifetime of [tpl]val|142.05|0.02|u=ns[/tpl],[ref]

Ortho-positronium (S = 1) lifetime in vacuum is
Positronium in the 2S state is metastable having a lifetime of [tpl]val|1.1|u=us[/tpl] against annihilation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl] The positronium created in such an excited state will quickly cascade down to the ground state, where annihilation will occur more quickly.  Measurements of these lifetimes, as well as of the positronium energy levels, have been used in precision tests of quantum electrodynamics.
Annihilation can proceed via a number of channels, each producing one or more gamma rays. The gamma rays are produced with a total energy of [tpl]val|1022|ul=keV[/tpl] (since each of the annihilating particles have mass of [tpl]val|511|ul=keV/c2[/tpl]), the most probable annihilation channels produce two or three photons, depending on the relative spin configuration of the electron and positron.  A single-photon decay is only possible if another body (e.g. an electron), to which some of the energy from the annihilation event may be transferred, is in the vicinity of the annihilating positronium. Up to five annihilation gamma rays have been observed in laboratory experiments,[ref]
