==Legal issues==

===Federal law===

The legal issues surrounding same-sex marriage in the United States are determined by the nation's federal system of government, in which the status of a person (including marriage) in general is determined by the individual states. Prior to 1996, the federal government did not define marriage; any marriage recognized by a state was recognized by the federal government, even if that marriage was not recognized by one or more other states (as was the case with interracial marriage before 1967 due to anti-miscegenation laws). With the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996, a marriage was explicitly defined in federal law as a union of one man and one woman.[tpl]usc|1|7[/tpl].
DOMA was challenged in the federal court system. On July 8, 2010, Judge Joseph Tauro of the District Court of Massachusetts held that the denial of federal rights and benefits to lawfully married Massachusetts same-sex couples is unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/us/09marriage.html|title=Judge Topples U.S. Rejection of Gay Unions|work=The New York Times|date=July 8, 2010|accessdate=June 2, 2011|first1=Abby|last1=Goodnough|first2=John|last2=Schwartz[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/09/judge-rules-federal-same-sex-marriage-ban-unconstitutional/?iref=allsearch&fbid=2-HnSdp2S6g|title=Judge rules federal same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional|publisher=CNN|date=July 9, 2010|accessdate=July 19, 2012[/tpl] Since 2010, eight federal courts have found DOMA to be unconstitutional on issues including bankruptcy, public employee benefits, estate taxes, and immigration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/entry/c/doma|title=The Defense of Marriage Act|publisher=Freedom to Marry|accessdate=July 19, 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/31/doma-unconstitutional-ruling-appeals-court-boston_n_1559031.html|title=DOMA Ruled Unconstitutional By Federal Appeals Court|last=Lavoie|first=Denise|date=May 31, 2012|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=July 19, 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.pewstates.org/projects/stateline/headlines/defense-of-marriage-act-discriminates-against-gays-federal-court-rules-85899424320|title=Defense of Marriage Act Discriminates Against Gays, Federal Court Rules|last=Malewitz|first=Jim|date=October 18, 2012|publisher=Pewstates.org|accessdate=October 20, 2012[/tpl] On October 18, 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals became the first court[tpl]cite web|last=Tiven|first=Rachel|title=Edie Wins!

According to the federal government's Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2004, more than 1,138 rights and protections are conferred to U.S. citizens upon marriage by the federal government; areas affected include Social Security benefits, veterans' benefits, health insurance, Medicaid, hospital visitation, estate taxes, retirement savings, pensions, family leave, and immigration law.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04353r.pdf|title=2004 updated report of the GAO|format=PDF|date=January 23, 2004|accessdate=December 20, 2011[/tpl]

Many aspects of marriage law are determined by the states, rather than the federal government. The Defense of Marriage Act does not prevent individual states from defining marriage as they see fit. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed Baker v. Nelson, a same-sex marriage case filed in Minnesota, "for want of a substantial federal question."Baker v. Nelson, [tpl]ussc|409|810|1972[/tpl].

On November 15, 2013, a U.S. district court in Pennsylvania denied a motion to dismiss in a same-sex marriage case, put forth by defendants who argued that Baker v. Nelson is binding precedent. The court said that "the jurisprudence of equal protection and substantive due process has undergone what can only be characterized as a sea change since 1972," allowing the case to proceed to trial in 2014.[tpl]cite news|last=Warden |first=Amy|title=Judge clears way for trial on Pa. gay marriage ban |url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-11-17/news/44141203_1_marriage-ban-marriage-rights-marriage-act |accessdate=November 18, 2013|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=November 17, 2013[/tpl]

Opponents of same-sex marriage have worked to prevent individual states from recognizing same-sex unions by attempting to amend the United States Constitution to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman. In 2006, the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would prohibit states from recognizing same-sex marriages, was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote and was debated by the full United States Senate, but was ultimately defeated in both Houses of Congress.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/07/same.sex.marriage/index.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080511145406/http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/07/same.sex.marriage/index.html|title=Senate blocks same-sex marriage ban|publisher=CNN|date=June 7, 2006|archivedate=May 11, 2008|accessdate=July 5, 2006[/tpl]

Prior to 2004, same-sex civil marriage was not recognized in any U.S. jurisdiction.

As of March 22, 2014, sixteen state governments (those of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington along with the District of Columbia) routinely issue same-sex marriage licenses. Illinois will begin regularly issuing licenses on June 1, 2014, while Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Michigan, and Texas are awaiting appellate court decisions after lower courts ruled in favor of allowing such licenses.
All jurisdictions in the Northeast Corridor save Pennsylvania have legalized same-sex marriage.
Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and Wisconsin have created legal unions for same-sex couples that offer varying subsets of the rights and responsibilities of marriage under the laws of those jurisdictions.
