The Class of 1960 was the first graduating class, with about 130 graduates from Centerport and Greenlawn only.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] That first class used the building for four years as it was being completed.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
The name Harborfields came from a combination of the older names of Centerport (ex Little Cow Harbor) and Greenlawn (ex Old Fields), selected from an entry by Billy Lefko and Robert Comito in a naming contest in about 1958.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
