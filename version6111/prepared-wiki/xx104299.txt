==History==

The stadium was originally built in 1933 after designs by German architect Paul Bonatz. After It was built, it was named "Adolf-Hitler-Kampfbahn". From 1945 to 1949 it was called Century Stadium and later Kampfbahn and was used by US Troops to play baseball.The name Neckarstadion was used since 1949.  It is home to VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga (and to the Stuttgarter Kickers when they played in the Bundesliga )
After a major refurbishment in the late 1980s and early 1990s partly financed by Daimler-Benz, the Stuttgart town council dedicated the stadium to Gottlieb Daimler. The inventor had tested both the first internal combustion motorcycle and the first 4-wheel automobile there in the 1880s, on the road from Cannstatt to Untertürkheim (now called Mercedesstraße).[tpl]cite web |url=http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-614781-1-1341630-1-0-0-0-0-0-11700-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html|title=Mercedes-Benz Classic: November 1885: Daimler riding car travels from Cannstatt to Untertürkheim|publisher=Daimler|date=25 October 2010|accessdate=22 February 2014[/tpl] The new museum, the headquarters and a factory of Mercedes-Benz are nearby.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mercedes-benz-classic.com/content/media_library/hq/hq_mpc_reference_site/passenger_cars_ng/passengercars_world/visit_mercedes-benz/mercedes-benz_museum/information/passengercars_passengercars_world_information_museum_info_en_pdf.object-Single-MEDIA.download.tmp/MBMUS_Infopdf_EN.pdf|title=Mercedes-Benz Museum – how to find us|publisher=Mercedes-Benz|accessdate=22 February 2014[/tpl]
The stadium capacity is currently around 41,000, after one stand (Untertürkheimer Kurve) has been demolished during summer 2009 in the process of converting it to a pure football arena. The rebuilt arena will be finished in December 2011 with a new capacity of 60,000, including terracing. Due to UEFA regulations, which only allows seating, the capacity is reduced to 54,906 during international football matches.
It is divided into four sections,
The Mercedes-Benz Arena features a unique fabric roof construction, making it easily recognizable. Made of precision-tailored membranes of PVC-coated polyester, the roof tissue is durable enough to withstand 1,000 kg of weight per square decimeter. It is suspended from an aesthetic steel frame that runs around the entire stadium weighing approximately 2,700 metric tons. The steel cables connecting the roof to the frame alone weigh about 420 tons. The roof wasn't added until the refurbishment preceding the 1993 World Athletics Championships.

==International matches==

The Mercedes-Benz Arena hosted four matches of the 1974 FIFA World Cup, two matches of the 1988 UEFA European Football Championship (a 1st Round match and a semi-final) and six games of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, including a Round of 16 game and the third-place playoff match (see below for details).
The stadium also hosted the finals of the European Cup (now known as UEFA Champions League) in 1959 (Real Madrid vs. Stade de Reims) and 1988 (PSV Eindhoven vs. S.L. Benfica).

==Redevelopment==

Starting in 2009, the Mercedes-Benz Arena will be redeveloped into a football-only stadium. It is planned that new stands will be constructed by the summer of 2011, with pitch level being lowered by 1.30 metres in time for the beginning of the 2009–2010 season. Once all the interior redevelopment is finished, the roof will be expanded to cover new rows of seats. The entire construction is expected to be finished by the end of 2011.[tpl]update after|2011|12|31[/tpl] The redevelopment was announced along with the stadium's name change in late March 2008. The first computer images of the new arena were released at the same time, also showing a large cube with four video scoreboards above the centre circle, similar to the one in the Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt.Groundwork set for stadium re-construction
Within the first couple of weeks of the redevelopment, 18 undetonated bombs left over from the air raids on Stuttgart during the Second World War were found on the construction site.Deutschland deine Stadien [tpl]de icon[/tpl] Weltfussball.de - Article on the redevelopment of football stadiums in Germany, accessed: 9 July 2009
