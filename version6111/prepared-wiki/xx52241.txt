[[Inert gas]]

An inert gas is a gas which does not undergo chemical reactions under a set of given conditions. The noble gases and nitrogen often do not react with many substances.[tpl]GoldBookRef | file = I03027 | title = inert gas[/tpl] Inert gases are used generally to avoid unwanted chemical reactions degrading a sample. These undesirable chemical reactions are often oxidation and hydrolysis reactions with the oxygen and moisture in air. The term inert gas is context-dependent because nitrogen gas and several of the noble gases can be made to react under certain conditions.
Purified nitrogen and argon gases are most commonly used as inert gases due to their high natural abundance (78% N2, 1% Ar in air) and low relative cost.
Unlike noble gases, an inert gas is not necessarily elemental and is often a compound gas. Like the noble gases the tendency for non-reactivity is due to the valence, the outermost electron shell, being complete in all the inert gases.Singh, Jasvinder. The Sterling Dictionary of Physics. New Delhi, India: Sterling, 2007. 122. This is a tendency, not a rule, as noble gases and other "inert" gases can react to form compounds.

==Production==

The inert gases are obtained by fractional distillation of air. For specialized applications, purified nitrogen gas may be produced by specialized generators on-site. They are often used aboard chemical tankers and product carriers (smaller vessels). Benchtop nitrogen generators are also available for laboratories.

==Applications==

Because of the non-reactive properties of inert gases they are often useful to prevent undesirable chemical reactions from taking place. Food is packed in nitrogen to remove oxygen gas. This prevents bacteria from growing.Maier, Clive & Teresa Calafut. Polypropylene: The Definitive User's Guide and Databook. Norwich, New York: Plastics Design Library, 1998. 105. Chemical oxidation by oxygen in air is avoided. An example is the rancidification of oil. In food packaging, inert gases are used as a passive preservative, in contrast to active preservatives like sodium benzoate (an antimicrobial) or BHT (an antioxidant).
Historical documents may also be stored under an inert gas to avoid degradation. For example, the U.S. Constitution is stored under humidified argon. Helium was previously used, but it was less suitable because it diffuses out of the case more quickly than argon.[tpl]cite web | title = Charters of Freedom Re-encasement Project | publisher = National Archives | url = http://www.archives.gov/press/press-kits/charters.html | accessdate = 2012-02-11[/tpl]
Nitrogen is often used as an inert gas in the chemical industry. In a chemical manufacturing plant, reactions are routinely conducted under nitrogen even if they are not sensitive to air, to minimize fire hazards. In such plants and in oil refineries, transfer lines and vessels are purged with inert gas, to avoid residual solvents or process fluids catching fire. At the bench scale, chemists perform experiments on air-sensitive compounds using air-free techniques developed to handle them under inert gas.
