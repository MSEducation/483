The Chapin Library supports the liberal arts curriculum of the college by allowing students close access to a number of rare books and documents of interest.

Over the years, Chapin Library has grown to include over 50,000 volumes (including 3,000 more given by Chapin) as well as 100,000 other artifacts such as prints, photographs, maps, and bookplates.[ref]
