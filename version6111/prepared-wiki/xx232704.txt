.</ref>  Rademacher calls these graphs '''based polyhedra'''. He defines them as the cubic [[polyhedral graph]]s with ''f'' faces in which one of the faces has ''f''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 sides. The graphs that fit this definition are exactly the cubic Halin graphs.
The Halin graphs are sometimes also called roofless polyhedra,[tpl]citation|title=Halin graphs and the travelling salesman problem|first1=G.|last1=Cornuéjols|first2=D.|last2=Naddef|first3=W.
