A number of contestants (known as "housemates") live in a purpose-built house in Espoo, and are isolated from the rest of the world. Each week, each housemate nominates two of their peers for eviction, and the housemates who receive the most nominations will face a public vote. Of these, one will eventually leave, having been "evicted" from the House. However, there sometimes are exceptions to this process as dictated by Big Brother, known as "twists". 

==Housemates==

Thirteen housemates entered the House at Launch. Four entered on Day 20, shortly before Marko's eviction, while two housemates entered on Day 45 as replacements for Harri and Marianna. Another two male housemates entered on Day 71, and one housemate on Day 73.

==Voting format==

Any viewer may cast as many evict or save votes as they choose. Prior to eviction each housemates' evict votes were merged with their save votes; the housemate with the lowest number of save votes remaining after the merge is evicted.

==Table of nominations==

The first Housemate listed is nominated for two points, while the second Housemate is nominated for one point. The two or more Housemates with the most nomination points face the public vote to save/evict, and when the save votes are subtracted from the evict votes, the Housemate with the most evict votes is evicted.
