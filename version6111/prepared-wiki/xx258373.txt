Scolton Manor is a Victorian country house and country park located in Pembrokeshire, West Wales. Built as a home, it is now a museum, located northeast of Haverfordwest and on the borders of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park.

==History==

Designed by local architects William and James Owen, it was occupied from 1842 by the Higgon family. Prominent amongst Pembrokeshire society, three family members held the position of High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire, including the last resident, Lt Col John Henry Victor Higgon (1902-1987).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/sites/haverfordwest/pages/scolton_manor.shtml|title=Scolton Manor|publisher=BBC Wales|date=16 August 2006|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl]

==Today==

Taken over by Pembrokeshire County Council, the house was lightly restored, while the out buildings display collections reflecting Pembrokeshire country life, including:
The exhibition hall displays the broad-ranging history of Pembrokeshire including natural history, geology, employment and trade, life during World War II and the Gwalia stores.
The David Burton-Richardson Collection and Archive of paintings, drawings and artefacts relating to the artists life is housed at Scolton Manor Museum. "From Now to Zero", a retrospective exhibition of David Burton-Richardson's works was held in 2005.
