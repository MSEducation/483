==Episcopal career==

On February 2, 1977, Hubbard was appointed Bishop of Albany by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following March 27 from Cardinal Terence Cooke, with Bishops Edwin B. Broderick and Edward Joseph Maginn serving as co-consecrators. He was the youngest bishop in the country at the time.
Appointed by Pope John Paul II to the Vatican's Secretariat for Non-Christians (now the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue), he is a supporter of the ecumenical movement, serving as Roman Catholic Co-chair of the Oriental Orthodox-Roman Catholic Consultation.  Under his leadership, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany has had a very active Catholic-Jewish dialogue, and has been at the forefront of efforts to achieve a good working relationship between the Roman Catholic Diocese and the Jewish community. He has been a leader in pro-life efforts,  suing to prevent an abortion clinic from opening in Albany and serving as president of New Yorkers Against the Death Penalty.
At the time of his retirement, Hubbard's tenure as bishop was the longest in the Diocese's history, at 37 years. The previous record was 35 years belonging to Edmund Gibbons.[tpl]cite news|title=Bishop to mark 25 years leading Diocese|url=http://www.evangelist.org/archive/htm3/0314mass.htm|publisher=The Evangelist|date=2002-03-14|accessdate=2008-08-19[/tpl] Liturgical design consultant Richard S.

==Controversies==

The Vatican announced on February 11, 2014, that Pope Francis had accepted Hubbard's resignation and appointed as his successor Rev. Msgr.
