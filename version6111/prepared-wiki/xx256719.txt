==History==

The agency originated as the Massachusetts Free Public Library Commission "to encourage the establishment of libraries by direct aid and to give advice relating to the maintenance and administration of libraries" in Massachusetts.Sanborn.

In its first years of existence, the board accomplished significant fulfillment of its mission. In 1890 "105 towns in the Commonwealth were without a free public library. Twenty years later, in 1910, every city and town, with one exception, had a library of its own.""Newbury, the exception, appropriates money toward the support of the Newburyport library and enjoys its rights and privileges." cf. Sanborn. League of Library Commissions Handbook. Chicago: American Library Association Publishing Board, 1915.
The name of the agency changed in 1952 from the "Massachusetts Board of Free Public Library Commissioners" to the "Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners.""By amendments to Massachusetts library legislation provided under Chapter 585 of the Acts and Resolves of 1952," cf. Library Journal 77, 1952 As of the 1990s it was "responsible for library development and resource sharing."Ethel Himmel. "State library agencies in the United States." Encyclopedia of library history. Taylor & Francis, 1994 As of 2010, "the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners is the agency of state government with the statutory authority and responsibility to organize, develop, coordinate and improve library services throughout the Commonwealth. The Board also strives to provide every resident of the Commonwealth with full and equal access to library information resources regardless of geographic location, social or economic status, age, level of physical or intellectual ability, or cultural background." It operates from offices in Boston's North End.MBLC website. Retrieved 2010-12-29
