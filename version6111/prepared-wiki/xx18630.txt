[[Highway]]

CATEGORIES: Highways, Road infrastructure, Types of roads

A highway is any public road or other public way on land. In North American and Australian English, the term frequently implies a major road such as a controlled-access highway or an arterial road, generally under the control of a state or provincial agency instead of a local road authority.
In British English, "highway" is primarily a legal term. Everyday use normally implies roads, while the legal use covers any route or path with a public right of access, including footpaths etc. The term has led to several related derived terms, including highway system, highway code, and highway patrol.
The equivalent term in water-based travel is "waterway".

==Overview==

Major highways are often named and numbered by the governments that typically develop and maintain them. Australia's Highway 1 is the longest national highway in the world at over  [tpl]convert|14500|km|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl] and runs almost the entire way around the continent. The United States has the world's largest network of highways, including both the Interstate Highway System and the U.S. Highway System. At least one of these networks is present in every state and they interconnect most major cities. Some highways, like the Pan-American Highway or the European routes, span multiple countries. Some major highway routes include ferry services, such as U.S. Route 10, which crosses Lake Michigan.
Traditionally highways were used by people on foot or on horses. Later they also accommodated carriages, bicycles and eventually motor cars, facilitated by advancements in road construction. In the 1920s and 1930s, many nations began investing heavily in progressively more modern highway systems to spur commerce and bolster national defense.
Major modern highways that connect cities in populous developed and developing countries usually incorporate features intended to enhance the road's capacity, efficiency, and safety to various degrees. Such features include a reduction in the number of locations for user access, the use of dual carriageways with two or more lanes on each carriageway, and grade-separated junctions with other roads and modes of transport. These features are typically present on highways built as motorways (freeways).

==Terminology==

===England and Wales===

The general legal definition deals with right of use not the form of construction; this is distinct from e.g. the popular use of the word in the US. A highway is defined in English common law by a number of similarly-worded definitions such as "a way over which all members of the public have the right to pass and repass without hindrance"Diplock LJ, Suffolk County Council v. Mason 1979 AC 705 usually accompanied by "at all times"; ownership of the ground is for most purposes irrelevant thus the term encompasses all such ways from the widest trunk roads in public ownership to the narrowest footpath providing unlimited pedestrian access over private land.
A highway might be open to all forms of lawful land traffic (i.e. vehicular, horse, pedestrian) or limited to specific types of traffic or combinations of types of traffic; usually a highway available to vehicles is available to foot or horse traffic, a highway available to horse traffic is available to pedestrians but exceptions can apply usually in the form of a highway only being available to vehicles or subdivided into dedicated parallel sections for different users.
A highway can share ground with a private right of way for which full use is not available to the general public as often will be the case with farm roads which the owner may use for any purpose but for which the general public only has a right of use on foot and/or horseback. The status of highway on most older roads has been gained by established public use while newer roads are typically dedicated as highways from the time they are adopted (taken into the care and control of a council or other public authority). In England and Wales, a public highway is also known as "The Queen's Highway".[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year=2013 |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Queen's%2Bhighway |title=Queen's highway |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl]
The core definition of a highway is modified in various legislation for a number of purposes but only for the specific matters dealt with in each such piece of legislation. This is typically in the case of bridges, tunnels and other structures whose ownership, mode of use and/or availability would otherwise exclude them from the general definition of a highway, examples in recent years are commonly toll bridges and tunnels which have the definition of highway imposed upon them (in a legal order applying only to the individual structure) to allow application of most traffic laws to those using them but without causing all of the general obligations or rights of use otherwise applicable to a highway.

===Scotland===

Scots law is similar to English law with regard to highways but with differing terminology and legislation. What is defined in England as a highway will often in Scotland be what is defined by s.151 Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 (but only "in this act" although other legislation could imitate) simply as a road, that is :-
The word highway is itself no longer a statutory expression in Scots law[tpl]cite book |first1= Ann |last1= Faulds |first2= Trudi |last2= Craggs |first3= John |last3= Saunders |lastauthoramp= yes |url= http://uk.practicallaw.com/books/9781845927806/chapter04 |title= Chapter 4: The Definition of a Road? |work= Scottish Roads Law |edition= 2nd |publisher= Practical Law Company |date= 31 January 2008 |accessdate=21 March 2014[/tpl] but remains in common law.

===United States===

In American law, the word "highway" is sometimes used to denote any public way used for travel, whether major highway, freeway, turnpike, street, lane, alley, pathway, dirt track, footpaths, and trails, and navigable waterways;[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] however, in practical and useful meaning, a "highway" is a major and significant, well-constructed road that is capable of carrying reasonably heavy to extremely heavy traffic.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] Highways generally have a route number designated by the state and federal departments of transportation.[tpl]Clarify|July 2010|date=July 2010[/tpl]
California Vehicle Code, Sections 360, 590, define a "highway" as only a way open for use of motor vehicles, but the California Supreme Court has held that "the definition of 'highway' in the Vehicle Code is used for special purposes of that act," and that canals of the Los Angeles neighborhood of Venice, California, are "highways" that are entitled to be maintained with state highway funds.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
Smaller roads may be termed byways.[tpl]cite web|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/highways+and+byways|title=highways and byways|work=The free dictionary|accessdate=21 April 2010[/tpl]

==History==

Modern highway systems developed in the 20th century as the automobile gained popularity. The world's first limited access road was constructed in Italy in 1922 (see autostrade).[tpl]cite web |url=http://german.about.com/library/blgermyth08_autobt.htm |title=An Autobahn Timeline |publisher= About.com |accessdate=10 April 2010[/tpl] Construction of the Bonn–Cologne autobahn began in 1929 and was opened in 1932 by the mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://german.about.com/library/blgermyth08.htm |title=German Myth 8 Hitler and the Autobahn |publisher= About.com[/tpl]
In the USA, the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act) enacted a fund to create an extensive highway system. In 1922, the first blueprint for a national highway system (the Pershing Map) was published. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 allocated $25 billion for the construction of the [tpl]convert|41000|mi|Mm[/tpl] long Interstate Highway System over a 20-year period.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/history.htm |title= History of the Interstate Highway System |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |accessdate=10 April 2010[/tpl]
In Great Britain, the Special Roads Act 1949 provided the legislative basis for roads for restricted classes of vehicles and non-standard or no speed limits applied (later mostly termed motorways but now with speed limits not exceeding 70mph);[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1949/pdf/ukpga_19490032_en.pdf |title=Special Roads Act 1949 |work=Office of Public Sector Information[/tpl] in terms of general road law this legislation overturned the usual principle that a road available to vehicular traffic was also available to horse or pedestrian traffic as is usually the only practical change when non-motorways are reclassified as special roads. The first section of motorway in the UK opened in 1958 (part of the M6 motorway) and then in 1959 the first section of the M1 motorway.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/m1m10m45.htm |title=M1 London: Yorkshire Motorway, M10 and M45 |work=Motorway Archives |accessdate=10 April 2010[/tpl]

==Social effects==

Reducing travel times relative to city or town streets, modern highways with limited access and grade separation create increased opportunities for people to travel for business, trade or pleasure and also provide trade routes for goods. Modern highways reduce commute and other travel time but additional road capacity can also create new induced traffic demand. If not accurately predicted at the planning stage, this extra traffic may lead to the new road becoming congested sooner than anticipated. More roads add onto car-dependence, which can mean that a new road brings only short-term mitigation of traffic congestion.
Where highways are created through existing communities, there can be reduced community cohesion and more difficult local access. Consequently property values have decreased in many cutoff neighborhoods, leading to decreased housing quality over time.

==Economic effects==

In transport, demand can be measured in numbers of journeys made or in total distance travelled across all journeys (e.g. passenger-kilometres for public transport or vehicle-kilometres of travel (VKT) for private transport). Supply is considered to be a measure of capacity. The price of the good (travel) is measured using the generalised cost of travel, which includes both money and time expenditure.
The effect of increases in supply (capacity) are of particular interest in transport economics (see induced demand), as the potential environmental consequences are significant (see externalities below).
In addition to providing benefits to their users, transport networks impose both positive and negative externalities on non-users. The consideration of these externalities—particularly the negative ones—is a part of transport economics. Positive externalities of transport networks may include the ability to provide emergency services, increases in land value and agglomeration benefits. Negative externalities are wide-ranging and may include local air pollution, noise pollution, light pollution, safety hazards, community severance and congestion. The contribution of transport systems to potentially hazardous climate change is a significant negative externality which is difficult to evaluate quantitatively, making it difficult (but not impossible) to include in transport economics-based research and analysis. Congestion is considered a negative externality by economists.[tpl]Cite book |last= Small |first= Kenneth A. |first2= José A. |last2= Gomez-Ibañez |lastauthoramp= yes |year= 1998 |title= Road Pricing for Congestion Management: The Transition from Theory to Policy |publisher= The University of California Transportation Center, University of California at Berkeley |page= 213 [/tpl]

==Environmental effects==

Highways are extended linear sources of pollution.
Roadway noise increases with operating speed so major highways generate more noise than arterial streets. Therefore, considerable noise health effects are expected from highway systems. Noise mitigation strategies exist to reduce sound levels at nearby sensitive receptors. The idea that highway design could be influenced by acoustical engineering considerations first arose about 1973.[tpl]cite book |first= John |last= Shadely |title= Acoustical analysis of the New Jersey Turnpike widening project between Raritan and East Brunswick |publisher= Bolt Beranek and Newman |year= 1973[/tpl][tpl]cite conference |first= Michael |last= Hogan |title= Highway Noise |conference= 3rd Environmental Pollution Symposium, sponsored by AIAA, ACS, ASME, SAE |publisher= SRI International |location= Menlo Park, CA |date= 17–18 April 1973[/tpl]
Air quality issues: Highways may contribute fewer emissions than arterials carrying the same vehicle volumes. This is because high, constant-speed operation creates an emissions reduction compared to vehicular flows with stops and starts. However, concentrations of air pollutants near highways may be higher due to increased traffic volumes. Therefore, the risk of exposure to elevated levels of air pollutants from a highway may be considerable, and further magnified when highways have traffic congestion.
New highways can also cause habitat fragmentation, encourage urban sprawl and allow human intrusion into previously untouched areas, as well as (counterintuitively) increasing congestion, by increasing the number of intersections. They can also reduce the use of public transport, indirectly leading to greater pollution.
High-occupancy vehicle lanes are being added to some newer/reconstructed highways in North America and other countries around the world to encourage carpooling and mass-transit. These lanes help reduce the number of cars on the highway and thus reduces pollution and traffic congestion by promoting the use of carpooling in order to be able to use these lanes. However, they tend to require dedicated lanes on a highway, which makes them difficult to construct in dense urban areas where they are the most effective.

==Road traffic safety==

Road traffic safety aims to reduce the harm (deaths, injuries, and property damage) on the highway system from traffic collisions and includes the design, construction and regulation of the roads, the vehicles that use them and also the training of drivers and other road-users. Improvement of road safety needs to be balanced with the provision of an effective efficient transport system. A report published by the World Health Organization in 2004 estimated that some 1.2m people were killed and 50m injured on the roads around the world each year[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/world_report/en/index.html|title=World report on road traffic injury prevention|publisher=World Health Organisation|accessdate=14 April 2010[/tpl] and was the leading cause of death among children 10–19 years of age.
The report also noted that the problem was most severe in developing countries and that simple prevention measures could halve the number of deaths.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/7776127.stm |title=UN raises child accidents alarm |publisher= BBC News |accessdate= | date= 10 December 2008[/tpl] For reasons of clear data collection, only harm involving a road vehicle is included.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] A person tripping with fatal consequences or dying for some unrelated reason on a public road is not included in the relevant statistics.

==Statistics==

The United States has the world's largest network of highways, including both the Interstate Highway System and the U.S. Highway System. At least one of these networks is present in every state and they interconnect most major cities.
China's highway network is the second most extensive in the world, with a total length of about 3.573 Gm.[tpl]cite news |url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKPEK18598420071116 |agency= Reuters |title= China says needs extra million km of roads by 2020 |first= Emma |last= Graham-Harrison |date= 16 November 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2008/html/P1503E.HTM |title= 15-3 Length of Transport Routes at Year-end by Region |publisher= China National Bureau of Statististcs |date= 2007 |accessdate=12 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinagate.cn/english/choice/50301.htm |title=China Has 3.48 Gm of Highways in Operation |publisher=Chinagate.cn |date=6 March 2007 |accessdate=12 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-01/07/content_6374334.htm |title=National highway target set for year |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date=7 January 2008 |accessdate=12 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.okokok.com.cn/Abroad/Class121/Class129/200812/121827.html |title=China Road Construction Report, 2007–2008 |publisher=Okokok.com.cn |date=22 December 2008 |accessdate=12 January 2013[/tpl] China's expressway network is the longest Expressway system in the world, and it is quickly expanding, stretching some 85 Mm at the end of 2011.[tpl]cite web |author= Staff |url=http://www.newgeography.com/content/002003-china-expressway-system-exceed-us-interstates |title=China Expressway System to Exceed US Interstates |date= 10 February 2011 |work=New Geography |accessdate=21 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csytv.com/news/china/2011-12-31/116464.html |title=中国高速公路总里程达8.5万公里 今年新增1.1万 – 沈阳广播电视台官方网站 – 沈阳电视台 – 资讯潮流 趣味生活 尽在沈视网！ |publisher=Csytv.com |date= |accessdate=12 January 2013[/tpl] In 2008 alone, 6.433 Mm expressways were added to the network.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-01/16/content_7403145.htm |title=More rural roads planned this year |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date=16 January 2009 |accessdate=12 January 2013[/tpl]

==Bus lane==

Some countries incorporate bus lanes onto highways.

===Korea===

In South Korea, in February 1995—Bus lane (essentially an HOV-9) established between the northern terminus and Sintanjin for important holidays and in 1 July 2008—Bus lane enforcement between Seoul and Osan (Sintanjin on weekends) becomes daily between 6 AM and 10 PM. On 1 October this is adjusted to 7 AM to 9 PM weekdays, 9 AM to 9 PM weekends.

===Hong Kong===

In Hong Kong, some highways are set up with bus lanes to solve the traffic congestion.

===Philippines===

Traffic Congestion was a principal problem in major roads and highways in the Philippines, especially in Metro Manila and other major cities. The government decided to set up some bus lanes in Metro Manila like in the Epifanio delos Santos Avenue.
