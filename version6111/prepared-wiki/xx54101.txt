Steve Lawson (born 1972) is a British solo electric bassist and looper.
He has released a number of albums on his own Pillow Mountain label, including solo works and various duets. All of these feature the live looping of multiple layers of both traditional and unusual bass generated sounds. He has also toured with groups supporting Level 42 and 21st Century Schizoid Band, on shared bills with other solo artists, such as Michael Manring and as a duo with his wife, singer Lobelia.
He uses two Modulus 6-string basses, one fretted and one fretless. He uses a Looperlative LP1 for looping and a majority of his effects are provided by the two Lexicon G2 multi-effects processors.
He is highly active and visible on the internet, interacting with fans and other musicians and using web technology such as Twitter to promote his own career and the work of other independent musical acts. He co-hosts a forum with Michael Manring at talkbass.com and is a regular contributor to thedudepit.com, basschat.co.uk and activebass.com.
Steve is also a music journalist, and was a regular contributor to Bassist and Guitarist Magazine, as well as writing for The Independent On Sunday, Third Way Magazine, Bass Player and Bass Guitar Magazine.
He teaches bass in North London.
