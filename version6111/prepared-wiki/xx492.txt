In the south is a large inland salt lake, the Salton Sea. The south-central desert is called the Mojave; to the northeast of the Mojave lies Death Valley, which contains the lowest and hottest place in North America, the Badwater Basin at [tpl]convert|−282|ft|m[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html |title=Elevations and Distances in the United States |publisher=USGS |location=Reston, Virginia |date=April 29, 2005 |accessdate=October 24, 2011[/tpl] Originally published in 1995. The horizontal distance from the nadir of Death Valley to the summit of Mount Whitney is less than [tpl]convert|90|mi|km[/tpl]. Indeed, almost all of southeastern California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer. The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the Colorado River, from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water.
Along the California coast are several major metropolitan areas, including Greater Los Angeles Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the San Diego metropolitan area.
As part of the Ring of Fire, California is subject to tsunamis, floods, droughts, Santa Ana winds, wildfires, landslides on steep terrain, and has several volcanoes. It sees numerous earthquakes due to several faults, in particular the San Andreas Fault.

===Climate===

Much of the state has a Mediterranean climate, with cool, rainy winters and dry summers. The cool California Current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast. Farther inland, one encounters colder winters and hotter summers.
Northern parts of the state average higher annual rainfall than the south. California's mountain ranges influence the climate as well: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a temperate climate, and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the Sierra Nevada, have an alpine climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.
The east side of California's mountains produce a rain shadow, creating expansive deserts. The higher elevation deserts of eastern California see hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains experience hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. Death Valley, a desert with large expanses below sea level, is considered the hottest location in the world; the highest temperature in the world,[tpl]cite journal|last=El Fadli|first=KI|author2=et al.|title=World Meteorological Organization Assessment of the Purported World Record 58°C Temperature Extreme at El Azizia, Libya (13 September 1922)|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00093.1|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|date=September 2012|doi=10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00093.1|volume=94|issue=2|pages=199[/tpl] (The 136 °F (57.8 °C), claimed by 'Aziziya, Libya, on September 13, 1922, has been officially deemed invalid by the World Meteorological Organization.)[tpl]cite web|title=World Meteorological Organization World Weather / Climate Extremes Archive|url=http://wmo.asu.edu/world-highest-temperature|accessdate=10 January 2013[/tpl] [tpl]convert|134|°F|°C|0[/tpl], was recorded there on July 10, 1913.

===Ecology===

California is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world, and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities. California is part of the Nearctic ecozone and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions.
California's large number of endemic species includes relict species, which have died out elsewhere, such as the Catalina Ironwood (Lyonothamnus floribundus). Many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation, whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac (Ceanothus). Many California endemics have become endangered, as urbanization, logging, overgrazing, and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat.

===Flora and fauna===

California boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the largest trees, the tallest trees, and the oldest trees. California's native grasses are perennial plants.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/may04/grass0504.htm |title=Restoring California's Native Grasses |journal=Agricultural Research magazine |author=David Elstein |date=May 2004 |volume= 52 |issue= 5 |page=17 |accessdate=December 25, 2009[/tpl] After European contact, these were generally replaced by invasive species of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California's hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer.
Because California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain, the state has six life zones which are the lower Sonoran (desert); upper Sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands), transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties); and the Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic Zones, comprising the state's highest elevations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/states/California-Flora-and-fauna.html |title=California: flora and fauna|publisher=city-data.com |year=2010 |accessdate=September 7, 2010[/tpl]
Plant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. The Joshua tree is found in the Mojave Desert. Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of asters. Fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive in the Central Valley. The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt, characterized by forests of small shrubs, stunted trees, and herbaceous plants. Nemophila, mint, Phacelia, Viola, and the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) – the state flower – also flourish in this zone, along with the lupine, more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world.
The transition zone includes most of California's forests with the redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and the "big tree" or giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), among the oldest living things on earth (some are said to have lived at least 4,000 years). Tanbark oak, California laurel, sugar pine, madrona, broad-leaved maple, and Douglas-fir also grow here. Forest floors are covered with swordfern, alumnroot, barrenwort, and trillium, and there are thickets of huckleberry, azalea, elder, and wild currant. Characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa, tulip, and tiger and leopard lilies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_1/sequoia/sempervirens.htm|title=Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.|publisher=fed.us (U.S. Forest Service)|accessdate=October 7, 2010[/tpl]
The high elevations of the Canadian zone allow the Jeffrey pine, red fir, and lodgepole pine to thrive. Brushy areas are abundant with dwarf manzanita and ceanothus; the unique Sierra puffball is also found here. Right below the timeberline, in the Hudsonian zone, the whitebark, foxtail, and silver pines grow. At about [tpl]convert|10500|ft|m[/tpl], begins the Arctic zone, a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers, including Sierra primrose, yellow columbine, alpine buttercup, and alpine shooting star.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.sierrahistorical.org/archives/lifezones.html| title=Life Zones of the Central Sierra Nevada| publisher=sierrahistorical.org| accessdate=October 5, 2010[/tpl]
Common plants that have been introduced to the state include the eucalyptus, acacia, pepper tree, geranium, and Scotch broom. The species that are federally classified as endangered are the Contra Costa wallflower, Antioch Dunes evening primrose, Solano grass, San Clemente Island larkspur, salt marsh bird's beak, McDonald's rock-cress, and Santa Barbara Island liveforever. [tpl]As of|1997|12[/tpl], 85 plant species were listed as threatened or endangered.
In the deserts of the lower Sonoran zone, the mammals include the jackrabbit, kangaroo rat, squirrel, and opossum. Common birds include the owl, roadrunner, cactus wren, and various species of hawk. The area's reptilian life include the sidewinder viper, desert tortoise, and horned toad. The upper Sonoran zone boasts mammals such as the antelope, brown-footed woodrat, and ring-tailed cat. Birds unique to this zone are the California thrasher, bushtit, and California condor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/California_Condor/id |title=California Condor|publisher=The Cornell Lab of Ornithology |year=2009 |accessdate=October 3, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/fauna/com-Mammal.html|title=CalPhotos: Browse Mammal Common Names|publisher=calphotos.berkeley.edu (BSCIT University of California, Berkeley) |date=October 2, 2010|accessdate=October 3, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://nrs.ucdavis.edu/quail/natural/birds_bushtit.htm|title=Quail Ridge Reserve: UC Davis Natural Reserve System|publisher=nrs.ucdavis.edu (University of California at Davis: Natural Reserve System) |date=April 5, 2007|accessdate=October 5, 2010[/tpl]
In the transition zone, there are Colombian black-tailed deer, black bears, gray foxes, cougars, bobcats, and Roosevelt elk. Reptiles such as the garter snakes and rattlesnakes inhabit the zone. In addition, amphibians such as the water puppy and redwood salamander are common too. Birds such as the kingfisher, chickadee, towhee, and hummingbird thrive here as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.westernhunter.com/Pages/Vol02Issue24/blacktail.html|title=Black-tailed Deer of California|publisher=westernhunter.com|year=2000|accessdate=October 7, 2010[/tpl]
The Canadian zone mammals include the mountain weasel, snowshoe hare, and several species of chipmunks. Conspicuous birds include the blue-fronted jay, Sierra chickadee. Sierra hermit thrush, water ouzel, and Townsend's solitaire. As one ascends into the Hudsonian zone, birds become scarcer. While the Sierra rosy finch is the only bird native to the high Arctic region, other bird species such as the hummingbird and Clark's nutcracker. Principal mammals found in this region include the Sierra coney, white-tailed jackrabbit, and the bighorn sheep. [tpl]As of|2003|04[/tpl], the bighorn sheep was listed as endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The fauna found throughout several zones are the mule deer, coyote, mountain lion, northern flicker, and several species of hawk and sparrow.
Aquatic life in California thrives, from the state's mountain lakes and streams to the rocky Pacific coastline. Numerous trout species are found, among them rainbow, golden, and cutthroat. Migratory species of salmon are common as well. Deep-sea life forms include sea bass, yellowfin tuna, barracuda, and several types of whale. Native to the cliffs of northern California are seals, sea lions, and many types of shorebirds, including migratory species.
As of April 2003, 118 California animals were on the federal endangered list; 181 plants were listed as endangered or threatened. Endangered animals include the San Joaquin kitfox, Point Arena mountain beaver, Pacific pocket mouse, salt marsh harvest mouse, Morro Bay kangaroo rat (and five other species of kangaroo rat), Amargosa vole, California least tern, California condor, loggerhead shrike, San Clemente sage sparrow, San Francisco garter snake, five species of salamander, three species of chub, and two species of pupfish. Eleven butterflies are also endangered"California's Endangered Insects", The Essig Museum of Entomology, University of California, Berkeley. and two that are threatened are on the federal list.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] Among threatened animals are the coastal California gnatcatcher, Paiute cutthroat trout, southern sea otter, and northern spotted owl. California has a total of [tpl]convert|290821|acre|km2[/tpl] of National Wildlife Refuges. [tpl]As of|2010|09[/tpl], 123 California animals were listed as either endangered or threatened on the federal list provided by the US Fish & Wildlife Service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/pub/stateListingAndOccurrenceIndividual.jsp?state=CA&s8fid=112761032792&s8fid=112762573902&s8fid=24012838822503 |title=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service: Species Reports: Listings and occurrences for California|publisher=ecos.fws.gov |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=September 7, 2010[/tpl] Also, [tpl]as of|2010|alt=as of the same year[/tpl], 178 species of California plants were listed either as endangered or threatened on this federal list.

===Rivers===

The vast majority of rivers in California are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the Central Valley Project, providing water to the agricultural central valley, the California State Water Project diverting water to from northern to southern California. The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the California Coastal Commission.
The two most prominent rivers within California are the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River, which drain the Central Valley and the west slope of the Sierra Nevada and flow to the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay. Several major tributaries feed into the Sacramento and the San Joaquin, including the Pit River, the Tuolumne River, and the Feather River.
The Eel River and Salinas River each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively, and the Eel River is the largest river in the state to remain in its natural un-dammed state. The Mojave River is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the Santa Ana River drains much of the Transverse Ranges as it bisects Southern California. Some other important rivers are the Klamath River and the Trinity River in the far north coast, and the Colorado River on the southeast border with Arizona.

==History==

Settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000 years, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America. Various estimates of the native population range from 100,000 to 300,000, which was about one-third of all native Americans in what is now the United States.[tpl]cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Starr |title=California: A History |series=Modern Library Chronicles |volume=23 |year=2007 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |isbn=978-0-8129-7753-0 |page=13[/tpl] The Indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct groups of Native Americans, ranging from large, settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior. California groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands, tribes, villages, and on the resource-rich coasts, large chiefdoms, such as the Chumash, Pomo and Salinan. Trade, intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups.
The first European effort to explore the coast as far north as the Russian River was a Spanish sailing expedition, led by Portuguese captain Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, in 1542. Some 37 years later English explorer Francis Drake also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579. Spanish traders made unintended visits with the Manila Galleons on their return trips from the Philippines beginning in 1565.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hyzercreek.com/britannica.htm |title=Page 1580 of the 1778 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica (second edition) |publisher=Hyzercreek.com |date=July 15, 2011 |accessdate=October 28, 2011[/tpl] Sebastián Vizcaíno explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for New Spain.
Finally, after the Portola expedition of 1769-70, Spanish missionaries began setting up 21 California Missions on or near the coast of Alta (Upper)California, beginning in San Diego. During the same period, Spanish military forces built several forts (presidios) and three small towns (pueblos). Two of the pueblos grew into the cities of Los Angeles and San Jose.

===19th century===

In 1821 the Mexican War of Independence gave Mexico (including California) independence from Spain; for the next 25 years, Alta California remained a remote northern province of the nation of Mexico.
Cattle ranches, or ranchos, emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California. After Mexican independence from Spain, the chain of missions became the property of the Mexican government and were secularized by 1834. The ranchos developed under ownership by Californios (Spanish-speaking Californians) who had received land grants, and traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants.
Beginning in the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the U.S. and Canada began to arrive in Northern California. These new arrivals used the Siskiyou Trail, California Trail, Oregon Trail and Old Spanish Trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts surrounding California. In this period, Imperial Russia explored the California coast and established a trading post at Fort Ross.
In between 1831 to 1836, California experienced a series of revolts against Mexico;[tpl]cite book |last=Altman |first=Linda Jacobs |title=California |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rAgL-tgWOecC&lpg=PA117&dq=1836%20California%20revolt&pg=PA117#v=onepage&q=1836%20California%20revolt&f=false |accessdate=March 16, 2013 |year=2005 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-1737-8 |page=117 [/tpl] [tpl]cite book |title=Testimonios: Early California Through the Eyes of Women, 1815–1848 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DuvFpaRwJlgC&lpg=PA427&dq=1836%20California%20revolt&pg=PA425#v=onepage&q=1836%20California%20revolt&f=false |accessdate=March 16, 2013 |year=2006 |publisher=Heyday |isbn=978-1-59714-033-1 |page=425[/tpl] this culminated in the 1836 California revolt lead by Juan Bautista Alvarado, which ended after Mexico appointed him governor of the department.Starr, Kevin.

In 1846 settlers rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt. Afterwards, rebels raised the Bear Flag (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words "California Republic") at Sonoma. The Republic's only president was William B. Ide,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=458|title=William B. Ide Adobe SHP|publisher=California State Parks|accessdate=December 25, 2009[/tpl] who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt.
The California Republic was short lived; the same year marked the outbreak of the Mexican-American War (1846–1848). When Commodore John D. Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into Monterey Bay and began the military occupation of California by the United States, Northern California capitulated in less than a month to the U.S. forces. After a series of defensive battles in Southern California, the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed by the Californios on January 13, 1847, securing American control in California.
Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the war, the region was divided between Mexico and the U.S.; the western territory of Alta California, was to become the U.S. state of California, and Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah became U.S. Territories, while the lower region of California, the Baja Peninsula, remained in the possession of Mexico.
In 1846 the non-native population of California was estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans down from about 300,000 prior to Hispanic settlement in 1769.Thomas J. Osborne (2012). Pacific Eldorado: A History of Greater California. John Wiley & Sons. p. 40. ISBN 1-118-29217-0 After gold was discovered, the population burgeoned with U.S. citizens, Europeans, Chinese and other immigrants during the great California Gold Rush.

In subsequent decades, the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias, which were often very small and isolated and lacked adequate natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them. As a result, the rise of California brought great hardship for the native inhabitants. Several scholars and Native American activists, including Benjamin Madley and Ed Castillo, have described the actions of the California government as a genocide.see also Benjamin Madley, American Genocide: The California Indian Catastrophe, 1846–1873, Yale University Press, 2012.[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]
The seat of government for California under Spanish and later Mexican rule was located at Monterey from 1777 until 1845.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/ca/intro.htm |title=Introduction |work=Early History of the California Coast |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=August 26, 2012[/tpl] Pio Pico, last Mexican governor of Alta California, moved the capital to Los Angeles in 1845. The United States consulate was also located in Monterey, under consul Thomas O. Larkin.
In 1849, the Constitutional Convention was first held in Monterey. Among the tasks was a decision on a location for the new state capital. The first legislative sessions were held in San Jose (1850–1851). Subsequent locations included Vallejo (1852–1853), and nearby Benicia (1853–1854); these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well.

Initially, travel between California and the rest of the continental U.S. was time consuming and dangerous. A more direct connection came in 1869 with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad through Donner Pass in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Once completed, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens came west, where new Californians were discovering that land in the state, if irrigated during the dry summer months, was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere.

===20th century===

Migration to California accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the Lincoln Highway and Route 66. In the period from 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the Union. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported California's population as 6.0% Hispanic, 2.4% Asian, and 89.5% non-Hispanic white.[tpl]cite web|title=California – Race and Hispanic Origin: 1850 to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html[/tpl] The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and 1928 St. Francis Dam flood remain the deadliest in U.S history.[tpl]cite book|author1=Shepard Krech, III|author2=J.
