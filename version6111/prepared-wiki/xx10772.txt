Known for hundreds of popular synthesizers, drum machines, and other instruments, Roland was one of the top names in professional music equipment in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

==Origin of the Roland name==

Kakehashi founded Ace Electronic Industries in 1960, a manufacturer of numerous combo organs, guitar amplifiers, and effects pedals. He was also contracted by Hammond to produce rhythm machines for the company's line of home organs. In 1973, Kakehashi cut ties with both companies to found Roland.
As with many Japanese start-ups of the period, the name Roland was selected for export purposes as Kakehashi was interested in a name that was easy to pronounce for his worldwide target markets. Rumour has long circulated that he named his company after the French epic poem La Chanson de Roland. In reality, the name Roland was found in a telephone directory. Kakehashi opted for it as he was satisfied with the simple two-syllable word and its soft consonants. The letter "R" was chosen because it was not used by many other music equipment companies, therefore it would stand out in trade show directories and industry listings. Kakehashi did not learn of "The Song Of Roland" until later.I Believe In Music, Ikutaro Kakehashi with Robert Olsen, 2002. p. 64

==Brands==

Roland markets products under a number of brand names, each of which are used on products geared toward a different niche.[tpl]cite web|title=Brands and Business Domains|url=http://www.roland.com/about/en/business_brand.html[/tpl] 
At one point, Roland acquired the then-defunct Rhodes name, and released a number of digital keyboards bearing the Rhodes brand, but it no longer owns the name. The late Harold Rhodes regained the right to the name in 2000. Rhodes was dissatisfied with Roland's treatment of the marque, and had plans to re-introduce his iconic electric piano, but died before he was able to bring it to market.
