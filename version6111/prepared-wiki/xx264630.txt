===Arrest===

One day prior to their arrest, Hellwig and Koch entered Iran on a tourist visa while planning  to investigate on the case of Sakineh Ashtiani (who had been sentenced to death by stoning for adultery) without the permission of Iranian authorities, and in violation of Iranian media law. They arranged to meet Ashtiani's lawyer and her son, Sadjad Qaderzadeh, for an interview, which was to be held in Tabriz in the northwestern region of Iranian Azerbaijan. After only a few questions, Iranian authorities intervened and arrested Hellwig and Koch as well as Ashtiani's lawyer and her son.
According to a spokesman of the judiciary, authorities were warned by a person close to Ashtiani's family, who became suspicious about the foreigners' visit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/146272.html| title=Iran arrests two fake foreign journalists|date=11 October 2010| publisher=Press TV[/tpl]

A year after being released Hellwig told readers of his tabloid that he "was regularly beaten and constantly interrogated" during the first 10 “brutal” days in captivity until a German diplomat intervened on their behalf. Iranian interrogators sometimes "claimed that I was a spy, then allegedly a terrorist,” Hellwig is quoted as saying.  According to Hellwig, he and Koch could hear torture victims throughout the day from their prison cell. “The cries were horrible.”
Hellwig plans to write a book of his experience.
