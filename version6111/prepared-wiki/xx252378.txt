German immigrant Anton Birkenfeld settled in the Nehalem Valley in 1886 and founded Birkenfeld in about 1910.[tpl]Cite OGN|7th|page=84[/tpl] Birkenfeld's post office was founded in 1916, bringing much-needed mail service on a more local basis. As of 2010, the Birkenfeld post office has been closed permanently. Although mail can still be addressed directly to the defunct post office, the community has a Clatskanie ZIP code, 97016 and all mail directed toward Birkenfeld is automatically redirected there.[tpl]cite web |url= http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/citytown.jsp |title= USPS ZIP Code Lookup[/tpl]
