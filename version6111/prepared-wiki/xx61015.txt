José Padilla (born October 18, 1970), also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir or Muhajir Abdullah ([tpl]pronunciation|En-us-Abdullah Al-Muhajir from U.S. pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg[/tpl] [tpl]respell|ahb|DUHL|lah[/tpl] [tpl]respell|al moo|HAH|jeer[/tpl][tpl]Need-IPA[/tpl]), is a United States citizen from Brooklyn, New York, who was convicted in federal court of aiding terrorists.
Padilla was arrested in Chicago on May 8, 2002, on suspicion of plotting a radiological bomb ("dirty bomb") attack. He was detained as a material witness until June 9, 2002, when President George W. Bush designated him an enemy combatant and, arguing that he was not entitled to trial in civilian courts, had him transferred to a military prison. Padilla was held for three and a half years as an "enemy combatant." He was subjected to what were called enhanced interrogation techniques, regarded as torture under International law, including sleep deprivation, shackling and stress positions, the administration of psychotropic drugs, and solitary confinement.Rosenthal, Andrew, "Tortured Logic", The New York Times, 3 May 2012. After pressure from civil liberties groups, the charge was dropped, and his case was moved to a civilian court.
On January 3, 2006, Padilla was transferred to a Miami, Florida, jail to face criminal conspiracy charges. On August 16, 2007, a federal jury found him guilty of conspiring to kill people in an overseas jihad, and to fund and support overseas terrorism. Government officials had earlier claimed Padilla was suspected of planning to build and explode a "dirty bomb" in the United States, a plot they had foiled, but he was never charged with this crime.
On January 22, 2008, Padilla was sentenced by Judge Marcia G. Cooke of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida to 17 years and four months in prison. His mother, Estela Ortega Lebron, was relieved. She announced that they would appeal the sentence: "You have to understand that the government was asking for 30 years to life sentence in prison. We have a chance to appeal, and in the appeal we're gonna do better.""Padilla given long jail sentence", BBC NEWS 

==Early life==

Jose Padilla was born in Brooklyn, New York, and later moved with his family to Chicago, Illinois. As a youth, he joined the Latin Kings street gang and was arrested several times. During his gang years, he maintained several aliases, such as José Rivera, José Alicea, José Hernandez, and José Ortiz. He was convicted of aggravated assault and manslaughter as a juvenile when a gang member he kicked in the head died.[tpl]cite news |first=Debra J. |last=Saunders |title=Padilla's life and Times |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/04/27/EDG7H6ABSQ1.DTL |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2004-04-27 |accessdate=2007-01-25[/tpl]
After serving his last jail sentence, he converted to Islam.Bomb' Suspect's Criminal Record." CNN. June 11, 2002 One of his early religious instructors was an Islamic teacher who professed a nonviolent philosophy, and Padilla appeared at the time to be faithful to his mentor's teachings.Sontag, Deborah. "Terror Suspect's Path From Streets To Brig", New York Times, April 25, 2004. While living in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Padilla attended the Masjid Al-Iman mosque, as did Adham Amin Hassoun, "for most of the 1990s and they were reportedly friends."[tpl]cite news |first=Susan |last=Candiotti |coauthors=Mark Potter |title=Feds arrest man linked to 'dirty bomb' suspect |url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/06/15/padilla.associate/ |work=CNN |date=2002-06-15 |accessdate=2007-01-25[/tpl]
U.S. authorities accused Hassoun of associating with radical Islamic fundamentalists, including Al-Qaeda. Hassoun was arrested in 2002 for overstaying his visa and was charged in 2004 with providing material support to terrorists."Two Defendants Charged in Florida with Providing Material Support to Terrorists", United States Department of Justice/ By that time Hassoun had already been charged with perjury, a weapons offense, and other offenses.

==Marriage and family==

Broward County court records show that on July 1, 1994, Padilla changed his name to one word: "Ibrahim." He was married under that name to Cherie Maria Stultz on January 2, 1996. They divorced in March 2001, according to court records. In January 2001, she had placed an ad in a local business newspaper, serving notice she was seeking divorce. Their divorce papers identify him as Jose Ibrahim Padilla.
Padilla married an Egyptian woman named Shamia'a, and they had two sons together. When he was arrested in 2002, the boys were infants. At his bail hearing, his wife and children were believed to be overseas."Judge Refuses To Set Bail For Padilla", Fox News, February 17, 2006.Goodnough, Abby.

==Afghanistan-Pakistan==

According to press reports in 2002, Padilla had been in the Afghanistan–Pakistan region in 2001 and early 2002.[ref]

 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
[/ref] At the time, the Defense Department said that Abu Zubaydah, then believed to be a top al-Qaeda official, had led the US to Padilla. Zubaydah had been under CIA custody and, it was later learned, had been tortured, making his evidence suspect. He was also found to have been only a low-level person.
Padilla was alleged to have been trained in the construction and employment of radiologic weapons - "dirty bombs" - at an al-Qaeda safe house in Lahore, Pakistan. Padilla and Binyam Mohammed, a United Kingdom resident, were alleged to have been recruited at the Lahore safe house to travel to the United States to launch terrorist attacks.

==Arrest==

Padilla traveled to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. On his return, he was arrested by U.S. Customs agents at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on May 8, 2002, and held as a material witness on a warrant issued in the state of New York stemming from the September 11, 2001 attacks.
On June 9, 2002, two days before District Court Judge Michael Mukasey was to issue a ruling on the validity of continuing to hold Padilla under the material witness warrant, President George Bush issued an order to Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to detain Padilla as an "enemy combatant." Padilla was transferred to a military brig in Charleston, South Carolina without any notice to his attorney or family. The order "legally justified" the detention using the 2001 AUMF passed in the wake of September 11, 2001 (formally "The Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution" (Public Law 107-40)) and opined that a U.S. citizen detained on U.S. soil can be classified as an enemy combatant. (This opinion is based on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in the case of Ex parte Quirin, a case involving the detention of a group of German–Americans in the United States working for Nazi Germany)."Authorization for Use of Military Force: Padilla v. Bush:, Jose Padilla under the Joint Resolution", The Syracuse Journal of International Law and Commerce, Syracuse University College of Law.
According to the text of the ensuing decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Padilla's detention as an "enemy combatant" (pursuant to the President's order) was based on the following reasons:

==2002 memos==

Shortly after September 26, 2002, the top political appointees David Addington, Alberto Gonzales, John A. Rizzo, William Haynes II, two Justice Department lawyers, Alice S. Fisher and Patrick F. Philbin, and then-Special Counsel to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense Jack Goldsmith flew to Camp Delta to view Mohammed al-Kahtani, then to Charleston, South Carolina to view Padilla, and finally to Norfolk, Virginia to view Yaser Esam Hamdi, who had been subjected to coercive techniques including solitary confinement.Mayer, Jane, "The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals," 2008. p. 199 It was later learned that top administration officials had earlier discussed and approved the use of enhanced interrogation techniques for the CIA. They were consulting with DOD agents to discuss techniques that might be used against the detainees in military custody. Later that year, additional "harsh techniques" were used on these three and other prisoners.
In October 2008, 91 pages of memos drafted in 2002 by officers at the Naval Consolidated Brig, Charleston were made public.[tpl]cite news |author=Cratty, Carol |title=Military concerned for detainee's sanity, records show |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/10/08/detainee.treatment/ |publisher=CNN |date=2008-10-08 |accessdate=2008-10-08 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2008%2FUS%2F10%2F08%2Fdetainee.treatment%2F&date=2008-10-09 |archivedate=2008-10-09[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=2002 Navy Consolidated Brig emails about the captives' mental health |url=http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2008/images/10/08/aclu.foia.doc.pdf |publisher=United States Department of Defense |year=2002 |accessdate=2008-10-09 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.cdn.turner.com%2Fcnn%2F2008%2Fimages%2F10%2F08%2Faclu.foia.doc.pdf&date=2008-10-09 |archivedate=2008-10-09[/tpl] The memos indicate that officers were concerned that the isolation of solitary confinement and lack of stimuli were causing the prisoner Yasser Hamdi mental anguish and threatened his sanity. The memos also state that Padilla and a third prisoner, Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, were held in similar conditions at the Brig.

==Habeas corpus==

Because Padilla was being detained without any criminal charges being formally made against him, he, through his lawyer, made a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as the respondent to this petition. The government filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the grounds that
The New York District Court disagreed with the government's arguments and denied its motion. However, the court declared that President Bush had constitutional and statutory authority to designate and detain American citizens as "enemy combatants."  It held that Padilla had the right to challenge his "enemy combatant" designation and detention in the course of his habeas corpus petition, although immediate release was denied. Both Padilla and the government made an interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
On December 18, 2003, the Second Circuit declared that
Declaring that without clear congressional approval (per [tpl]uscsub|18|4001|a[/tpl]), President Bush cannot detain an American citizen arrested in the United States and away from a zone of combat as an "illegal enemy combatant," the court ordered that Padilla be released from the military brig within 30 days.[tpl]cite news |first=Reynolds |last=Holding |title=Courts affirm rights of terror suspects / Judges reject Bush policies on prisoners in Cuba and U.S. |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/12/19/MNGHL3QVFA1.DTL |work=San Francisco Chronicle |page=A-1 |date=2003-12-19 |accessdate=2007-01-25[/tpl] But, the court had stayed the release order pending the government's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

===U.S. Supreme Court===

On February 20, 2004, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the government's appeal. The Supreme Court heard the case, Rumsfeld v. Padilla, in April 2004, but on June 28, 2004, the court dismissed the petition on technical grounds because

===District Court for South Carolina===

The case was refiled in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, and on February 28, 2005, the court ordered that the government either charge or release Padilla.[tpl]cite news|title=Federal judge: Charge Padilla or release him|date=March 1, 2005|publisher=CNN|first=Phil|last=Hirschkorn|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2005-03-01/justice/padilla.ruling_1_jose-padilla-donna-newman-enemy-combatant-case[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Court upholds Padilla detention|date=September 9, 2005|publisher=Washington Times|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/sep/9/20050909-113106-7643r/[/tpl] On June 13, 2005, the Supreme Court denied the government's petition to have his case heard directly by the court, instead of the appeal being first heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia.
On September 9, 2005, a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit ruled that President Bush had the authority to detain Padilla without charges. An opinion written by judge J. Michael Luttig cited the joint resolution by Congress authorizing military action following the September 11, 2001, attacks, as well as the June 2004 ruling concerning Yaser Hamdi.
Attorneys for Padilla and civil liberties organizations, filing amicus curiae briefs, argued that the detention was illegal. They said it could lead to the military holding anyone, from protesters to people who check out what the government considers the wrong books from the library. The Bush administration denied the allegations. The defense argument noted that the congressional military authorization (the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists) pertained only to nations, organizations, or persons whom the president "determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11, 2001, attacks, or harbored such organizations or persons." They advanced a reading of this language would suggest a Congressional limitation to the military power would assure an appropriately narrow range of detainees and that the power to detain would last only so long as the Congressional authorization was not revoked or remained in effect by its terms. Similarly, they noted that the Yaser Hamdi Supreme Court case (Hamdi v. Rumsfeld) upon which the court relied, required a habeas corpus hearing for any alleged enemy combatant who demands one, claiming not to be such a combatant, which would require additional judicial or military tribunal oversight over each such detention.
The argument in the general public concerning the legality of Padilla's detention examined one of the provisions of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 enacted on October 17, 2006, which states: [tpl]Blockquote|Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, and notwithstanding any other law added (including section 2241 of title 28, United States Code, or any other habeas corpus provision), no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any claim or cause of action whatsoever, including any action pending on or filed after the date of enactment of this chapter, relating to the prosecution, trial, or judgment of a military commission convened under this section, including challenges to the lawfulness of the procedures of military commissions under this chapter.[/tpl]
The Military Commissions Act of 2006 does not apply by its terms to José Padilla, since he is a U.S. citizen. Other provisions of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 may provide civil and criminal amnesty to those involved in his case, who might otherwise face civil rights lawsuits or criminal liability for unlawfully detaining someone. The immunity provisions may be tested in a civil suit brought by Padilla against John Yoo of the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice (discussed below).

==Indictment==

On November 22, 2005, CNN reported that Padilla had been indicted in federal court on charges he "conspired to murder, kidnap, and maim people overseas."[tpl]cite news |first=Kelli |last=Arena |coauthors=Terry Frieden and Phil Hirschkorn |title=Terror suspect Padilla charged |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/11/22/padilla.case/index.html |work=CNN |date=2005-11-22 |accessdate=2007-01-25[/tpl] Padilla's lawyer correlated the indictment's timing as avoidance of an impending Supreme Court hearing on the Padilla case: "The administration is seeking to avoid a Supreme Court showdown over the issue."[tpl]cite news |first=Fred |last=Barbash |title=Padilla's Lawyers Suggest Indictment Helps Government Avoid Court Fight |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/22/AR2005112201061.html |work=Washington Post |date=2005-11-22 |accessdate=2007-01-25[/tpl] None of the original allegations made by the U.S. government three years prior, which had contributed to Padilla's being held the majority of the time in solitary confinement,  was part of the indictment, nor was there any charge related to incidents within the United States.
Democracy Now said:
 "Attorney General Alberto Gonzales announced Padilla is being removed from military custody and charged with a series of crimes" and "There is no mention in the indictment of Padilla's alleged plot to use a dirty bomb in the United States. There is also no mention that Padilla ever planned to stage any attacks inside the country. And there is no direct mention of Al-Qaeda. Instead the indictment lays out a case involving five men who helped raise money and recruit volunteers in the 1990s to go overseas to countries including Chechnya, Bosnia, Somalia and Kosovo. Padilla, in fact, appears to play a minor role in the conspiracy. He is accused of going to a jihad training camp in Afghanistan but his lawyers said the indictment offers no evidence he ever engaged in terrorist activity."[tpl]cite video |people=Amy Goodman, Andrew Patel, Bill Goodman |date=2005-11-23 |title=Why did the Bush Administration Hold Jose Padilla for 3 Years as an Enemy Combatant?

Considering Padilla was held for years in military custody with no formal charges, many observers were shocked by the charges finally brought by the Bush presidential administration.[tpl]cite news |first=Shannon |last=McCaffrey |title=Indictment of Padilla unveiled |url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/homepage/article_852377.php |work=OC Register |date=2005-11-23 |accessdate=2007-01-25[/tpl] Critics said such a process would allow the U.S. government to detain citizens indefinitely without presenting the cause that would eventually be tried.

On January 3, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a Bush administration request to transfer Padilla from military to civilian custody. Padilla was transferred to a federal prison in Miami while the Supreme Court decided whether to accept his appeal of the government's authority to keep US citizens it designates "enemy combatants" in open-ended military confinement without benefit of trial.
On April 3, 2006, the Supreme Court declined, with three justices dissenting from denial of certiorari, to hear Padilla's appeal from the 4th Circuit Court's decision. It left the 4th Circuit court's ruling that the president had the power to designate and detain him as an "enemy combatant" without charges and with disregard to habeas corpus.[tpl]cite news|title=Justices, 6-3, Sidestep Ruling on Padilla Case|first=David|last=Stout|publisher=New York Times|date=April 3, 2006|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/03/us/03cnd-scotus.html[/tpl]

==Criminal proceedings==

Padilla was indicted on three criminal counts in the Miami, Florida, criminal proceeding. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. The trial commenced on May 15, 2007,"Jose Padilla Trial Begins" and lasted for 3 months.

===Partial dismissal of counts against Padilla===

Two weeks after the presiding judge claimed prosecutors were "light on facts" in their conspiracy allegations, the government dismissed one of its three charges against Padilla and dismissed another in part.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13462968/ |title=Judge agrees Padilla terror case ‘light on facts’ / Prosecutors ordered to back up their assertion defendants conspired to injure, kill |work=MSNBC |publisher=Associated Press |date=2006-06-21 |accessdate=2007-01-25[/tpl] The count of conspiracy to murder (punishable by life imprisonment) was dismissed on August 16, 2006, on the grounds that it was duplicative of the other two counts pending against him. The second count was conspiracy to materially aid terrorists under [tpl]USC|18|371[/tpl] (punishable by five years in prison) and the third was [tpl]USC|18|2339A[/tpl] (punishable by 15 years in prison). The trial court ordered that the government elect a single criminal statute in its second count of the indictment.
But, on January 30, 2007, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit reversed the ruling and reinstated a charge of conspiracy to "murder, kidnap, and maim."[tpl]cite news |first=Jeff |last=St. Onge |title=Appeals Court Renews Charge Against Padilla |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/47699 |work=New York Sun |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2007-02-16 [/tpl]

===Torture during imprisonment===

Padilla's legal team filed a motion to dismiss the case, alleging that during his imprisonment he had been subjected to torture, including sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation, and enforced stress positions, and had been administered various drugs, including possibly LSD and PCP.[tpl]cite news |first=Dan |last=Eggen |title= More setbacks for case against terror suspect / Legal debate flares over trying charges in a criminal court |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/11/19/MNGG5MFSMK1.DTL |work=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=Washington Post |date=2006-11-19 |accessdate=2007-01-25[/tpl]
In the later case of Padilla v. Yoo, Padilla filed a civil suit against John Yoo, who while in the Office of Legal Counsel had written the Torture Memos authorizing agencies to use coercive techniques. The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in May 2012 that while torture is unconstitutional, and while "we assume without deciding that Padilla’s alleged treatment rose to the level of torture," Padilla's treatment was not necessarily defined as torture at the time it occurred in 2002–2003.

===Delays in prosecution===

Two additional motions filed in October 2006, argued that the case should be dismissed because the government took too much time between arresting Padilla and charging him.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl] In essence, the argument was that for constitutional speedy trial purposes, the arrest took place prior to his detention as an enemy combatant and not when he was transferred to civilian custody.

===Mental competency hearing===

In January 2007 a mental competency hearing was scheduled for Padilla for February 22, 2007, related to damages due to allegations of torture by the military.[tpl]cite news |first=Warren |last=Richey |title=Was Jose Padilla tortured by US military? |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0216/p02s01-usju.html |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=2007-02-16 |accessdate=2007-02-16 [/tpl] Two mental health experts hired by the defense to conduct a competency evaluation concluded Padilla was not mentally fit for trial; a third evaluation submitted by the Bureau of Prisons found him mentally competent. The judge ordered that Sandy Seymour, technical director of the Charleston brig; Craig Noble, brig psychologist; Andrew Cruz, brig social worker; four employees of the Miami federal detention center; and a Defense Department lawyer appear at the hearing.[tpl]cite news |first=Vanessa |last=Blum |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-216dirtybomber,0,1684842.story?coll=sfla-home-headlines |title=Judge says 3 from Navy brig must testify at terror suspect's sanity hearing |work=Sun-Sentinel |date=2007-02-16 |accessdate=2007-02-16 [/tpl]

He has a great deal of difficulty talking about the current case before him." In cross examination, federal prosecutor John Shipley noted that Padilla had a score of zero on Hegarty's post-traumatic stress disorder test and pointed out that this information was omitted in her final report. Hegarty said that this omission was an error on her part. Another psychiatrist hired by the defense testified along the same lines. The Miami Herald reported that a "U.S. Bureau of Prisons psychiatrist who believes Padilla is fit to face trial and Defense Department officials—are expected to testify at the ongoing hearing before U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke."

===Conviction and sentencing===

On August 16, 2007, after a day and a half of deliberations, the jury found Padilla guilty on all counts. He was scheduled to be sentenced on December 5, 2007, but his sentencing was postponed to January due to the death of a family member of the judge scheduled to sentence him. He was sentenced on January 22, 2008, to 17 years and 4 months in federal prison."Padilla sentenced on terror charges." MSNBC.com.

===Direct appeal of criminal conviction===

As of February 28, 2008, Padilla had appealed his conviction and sentence, and the government had cross-appealed."Let's get ready to rumble" The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial, "the lawyers suing for Padilla aren't interested in justice. They're practicing 'lawfare,' which is an effort to undermine the war on terror by making U.S. officials afraid to pursue it for fear of personal liability." In January 2012, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and his case has been ruled on numerous times."'Lawfare' Loses Big", Wall Street Journal

===Sentence ruled too lenient===

On September 19, 2011, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the 17-year prison sentence imposed on Padilla, ruling that the sentence was too lenient. They sent the case back for a new sentencing hearing. The Court said, "Padilla's sentence of 12 years below the low end of the sentencing guidelines range reflects a clear error of judgment about the sentencing of this career offender.""US court says 17-year prison sentence for terror plotter Jose Padilla is too short", Global Winnipeg[tpl]cite news|title=Court says Padilla sentence too lenient|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/19/us-usa-security-padilla-idUSTRE78I49120110919?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews&rpc=22&sp=true|work=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=19 September 2011|date=September 19, 2011[/tpl]

==Criticism of his conviction==

Andrew Patel, Padilla’s lawyer, said after the guilty verdict,
 “What happened in this trial, I think you have to put it in the context of federal conspiracy law, where the government doesn’t have to prove that something happened, but just that people agree that something should happen in the future. In this case, it was even more strained. The crime charged in this case was actually an agreement to agree to do something in the future. So when you’re dealing with a charge like that, you’re not going to have—or the government’s not going to be required to produce the kind of evidence that you would expect in a normal criminal case.”"Jose Padilla Convicted-The Expanding U.S. Machinery of Repression: ?Thought Crimes,? Preventive Detention, and Torture", Rev Com 
Paul Craig Roberts criticized the jury's verdict in the Padilla case as having "overthrown" the Constitution and doing far more damage to U.S. liberty than any terrorist could.Paul Craig Roberts, "Padilla Jury Opens Pandora’s Box", Lew Rockwell
Andy Worthington wrote, "Seventeen years and four months seems to me to be an extraordinarily long sentence for little more than a thought crime, but when the issue of Padilla's three and half years of suppressed torture is raised, it's difficult not to conclude that justice has just been horribly twisted, that the president and his advisers have just got away with torturing an American citizen with impunity, and that no American citizen can be sure that what happened to Padilla will not happen to him or her. Today, it was a Muslim; tomorrow, unless the government's powers are taken away from them, it could be any number of categories of 'enemy combatants' who have not yet been identified."Andy Worthington "Why Jose Padilla’s 17-year prison sentence should shock and disgust all Americans", Andy Worthington » Blog Archive »
Timothy Lynch of the Cato Institute raised several issues related to the Padilla seizure in an amicus brief he filed to the Supreme Court. In it, he asks questions such as whether the president can lock up any person in the world and then deny that person access to family, defense counsel, and civilian court review; and the use of "harsh conditions" and "environmental stresses." He questioned whether such techniques be employed against anyone once the president gives an order. Those legal questions remain unsettled."Brief of the Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae in Support of Respondents", Cato Institute By abruptly moving Padilla from the military brig and into the civil criminal justice system, Lynch argued that the Bush administration was able to forestall Supreme Court review of the president’s military powers.

A 2012 editorial in the Wall Street Journal describes efforts of the ACLU and others on Padilla's behalf as "lawfare." It said that the court ruling throwing out a lawsuit filed for Padilla as a "victory for legal sanity."[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203718504577181191271527180.html|title='Lawfare' loses big[/tpl]

==Civil proceedings==

On January 4, 2008, Padilla and his mother filed suit against John Yoo in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (Case Number CV08 0035).[tpl]cite news |author=Yoo, John|title=Terrorist Tort Travesty |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120070333580301911.html?mod=sphere_ts |pages=Page A13 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=2008-01-19 |accessdate=2008-02-10 |quote=Last week, I (a former Bush administration official) was sued by José Padilla—a 37-year-old al-Qaeda operative convicted last summer of setting up a terrorist cell in Miami.

On June 12, 2009, the trial court held that the complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim, because if everything stated in the complaint was taken as true, it stated grounds for Yoo to be liable to Padilla for civil damages.http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/padilla-yoo.pdf But on February 17, 2011, the District Court dismissed another suit by Padilla against other former officials (plus the incumbent secretary of defense) that had been brought February 9, 2007. Lebron v. Rumsfeld, 764 F.Supp.2d 787 (D.S.C.). On January 23, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed this dismissal.Lebron v. Rumsfeld, http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/116480.P.pdf
In May 2012, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Yoo could not be held accountable for Padilla's treatment because, though his treatment might have amounted to torture, it was not clearly defined as such legally in 2002–2003 when it occurred.

==Names==

According to his attorney and others, Padilla has changed the pronunciation of his family name from the typical [tpl]IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|d|iː|j|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|pə|DEE|yə[/tpl] to [tpl]IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|d|ɪ|l|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|pə|DIL|ə[/tpl].[tpl]cite video |people=Donna Newman |date=2005-11-22 |title=Does Not Rhyme With "Tortilla" |url=http://media2.washingtonpost.com/media/slate/Podcasts/20051122_Padilla.wma |format=WMA audio |accessdate=2007-01-25 |publisher=Washington Post[/tpl] (See also Ll.) Padilla's Arabic name Abdullah al-Muhajir, which he began using during his jail sentence, literally means "Abdullah the migrant". "Al-Muhajir" is a laqab (epithet) rather than an adopted family name. Padilla is not related or known to be connected in any way to Abu Hamza al-Muhajir. Padilla is a family name of Sephardic Jewish origin in Puerto Rico.
