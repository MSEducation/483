On his website he says; 'not being a natural talent, I had to work harder than most paying particular attention to technique and skill. I was fortunate to receive some of the very best coaching available during my career, which to this day continues to remain an inspiration to me.'
Robins greatest sporting moment came at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics when you broke the Olympic record (200m individual medley) in the semi finals. "I pretty much went to the Olympic Games without expectations. I'd done my research and I knew, really, that there were two swimmers way ahead of the game. On the day I had a great heat, I just tried too hard in the final and that for me has been a lesson in life; you've got to apply just the right amount of pressure. If you over hurt yourself early on it really comes back on you. It's got to be 100% not a 110%, 110% is a 90% return."
