Milton "Gummo" Marx (October 23, 18931900 Census shows birth year as Oct 1892 and his World War I draft registration says 21 Oct 1892 Roll #1613143, on his death certificate and his grave the year 1893 is given. â€“ April 21, 1977) was an American vaudeville performer and theatrical agent. He was the fourth-born of the Marx Brothers. Born in New York City, he worked with his brothers on the vaudeville circuit, but left acting when he was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War I, years before his four brothers (Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, and Zeppo Marx) began their film career.

==Life and career==

Marx was born in New York City. His parents were Sam Marx (called "Frenchie" throughout his life), and his wife, Minnie Schoenberg Marx. Minnie's brother was Al Shean. Marx's family was Jewish. His mother was from Dornum in East Frisia; and his father was a native of Alsace, and worked as a tailor.La famille paternelle des Marx Brothers [tpl]fr icon[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mrs. Minnie Marx.

His military service began shortly before the Armistice, and he was therefore never sent overseas. After leaving the army, Gummo, who in an interview said he never liked being on stage, went into the raincoat business.[tpl]citation |title=Current Biography |url=http://tc.education.pitt.edu/library/MS-ReSearch/I-Search2009/MarxBrothersCurrentBio.html |publisher=The H. W. Wilson Company |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29[/tpl] Later he joined with his brother Zeppo Marx and operated a theatrical agency. After that collaboration ended, Gummo represented his brother Groucho Marx and worked on the television show The Life of Riley, which he helped develop. He also represented other on-screen talent and a number of writers.
Gummo was well respected as a businessman. He rarely had contracts with those he represented, his philosophy being that, if they liked his work, they would continue to use him, and if not, they would seek representation elsewhere.Simon Louvish.

Gummo was given his nickname because he had a tendency to be sneaky backstage, and creep up on others without them knowing (like a gumshoe). Another explanation cited by biographers and family members is that Milton, being the sickliest of the brothers, often wore rubber overshoes, also called "gumshoes," to protect himself from taking sick in inclement weather.
He married Helen von Tilzer on March 16, 1929. Their son, Robert, was born in 1930. [tpl]citation |title=Gummo Marx Biography |url=http://marx-brothers-groucho-chico-harpo-zeppo.info/gummo-marx-biography/ [/tpl]
Gummo died on April 21, 1977, at his home in Palm Springs, California from a cerebral hemorrhage following two strokes.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Gummo Marx, Managed Comedians |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20B1EFF3B5B167493C0AB178FD85F438785F9 |quote=Palm Springs, California, April 21, 1977 (Reuters) Gummo Marx, an original member of the Marx brothers' comedy team, died here today. He was 84 years old. |publisher=New York Times |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-12-15[/tpl] His death was never reported to Groucho, who by that time had become so ill and weak that it was thought the news would be of further detriment to his health. Groucho died four months later.
His grandsons are actors Gregg Marx, Chris Marx, and actor/producer Brett Marx, who as a child actor appeared as 'Jimmy Feldman' in 1976's comedy film The Bad News Bears.
When Richard J. Anobile asked Groucho in The Marx Bros. Scrapbook with which brother he was closest, Groucho replied. "Gummo. He's a nice man, and that's more than I can say for Zeppo."[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
