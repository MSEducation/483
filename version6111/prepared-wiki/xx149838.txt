==Career==

He started as a calypso singer under the stage name Lord Creator, and moved to Jamaica in the late 1950s.  There he recorded his first hit, "Evening News", in 1959 with Fitz Vaughan Bryan's big band.  In 1962, he recorded "Independent Jamaica" with producer Vincent "Randy" Chin,Campbell, Howard (2012) "Lord Creator marks JA's Independence celebration", Jamaica Observer, 3 August 2012, retrieved 6 August 2012 which became the official song marking Jamaica's independence from the British Empire on 6 August 1962.  That song was also the first record on Chris Blackwell's newly founded Island Records label in the United Kingdom (Island 001).  In 1963, "Don't Stay Out Late", produced by Chin, became a hit in Jamaica.
In 1964, he had a further hit with "Big Bamboo", produced by Coxsone Dodd with Tommy McCook on saxophone.  After "Little Princess" in 1964, he recorded a calypso album, Jamaica Time, at Studio One.  It included calypso classics like "Jamaica Farewell" and "Yellowbird", as well as a cover of Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind".  His next album, Big Bamboo, was recorded at Dynamic Studios sometime after 1969, when the studio was established by Byron Lee.  Carlton Lee is listed as the producer.
Creator had another big hit with "Kingston Town", a tune he recorded for producer Clancy Eccles in 1970. After that, Lord Creator virtually disappeared from the music industry; although in 1976, he still recorded "Big Pussy Sally", a no-holding-back, free-spirited song which was done on the same tape as Fay Bennett's equally lewd and light-hearted "Big Cocky Wally" for Lee 'Scratch' Perry in the Black Ark studio. Both songs were released on two separate Island Records singles in the UK, both on the B-side accompanied by two different Upsetters dubs.  In 1978 Creator returned to the Black Ark to re-record his in 1968 in Randys studio recorded, Vincent Chin produced song, "Such is Life".
He returned to Trinidad and Tobago after suffering two strokes.
In 1989, the British band UB40 recorded a cover version of "Kingston Town", which helped to revive Lord Creator's career. He appeared in oldies shows in Jamaica, and toured Japan.
He now lives in Montego Bay.
