Frontier College is a Canadian literacy organization established in 1899 by Alfred Fitzpatrick. Founded as the Reading Camp Association,[tpl]cite book |author=James H. Morrison |coauthors= |title=Camps & Classrooms: A Pictorial History of Frontier College |year=1989 |publisher=Toronto: Frontier College Press |isbn=0921031068 [/tpl] Frontier College aims to improve literacy levels in Canada by providing education to those that seek assistance with their learning and have been overlooked or left behind by the formal educational system. Frontier College runs myriad English-language and French-language literacy programs for children, youth and adults in many places across Canada such as community centers, shelters, farms and prisons. It was renamed Frontier College in 1919.
Since 1986, its national headquarters has been located at Gzowski House (named for the celebrated Canadian journalist, the late Peter Gzowski) in Toronto, Ontario.

It has strong, widespread presence in Ontario and Quebec, and also maintains staff that operate regional and provincial offices in other parts of  Canada. It also maintains a large volunteer base through its network of Frontier College campus programs located at many universities across Canada, which recruits university students to volunteer as tutors in its programs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.frontiercollege.ca/english/help/volunteer.html |title=Volunteering with Frontier College |publisher=Frontiercollege.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-10-18[/tpl]

==History==

In 1899, the Canadian Shield in northern Ontario was dotted with isolated lumber camps that were cut off from larger society. Alfred Fitzpatrick, a 37 year old Nova Scotian, who was then a young minister of a Presbyterian Church at Nairn Centre (located west of Sudbury, Ontario), saw that many of the young men - who were largely new immigrants - that worked at these camps were denied the benefits of culture, education and enlightenment. Influenced by the notions of the Social Gospel movement and the teachings of Professor George Grant at his alma mater (Queen's University), Fitzpatrick recognized that these men deserved "not charity but social justice.[tpl]cite book |author=Larry Krotz, Erica Martin and Philip Fernandez |coauthors= |title=Frontier College Letters: One Hundred Years of Teaching, Learning and Nation Building |year=1999  |publisher=Frontier College Press |isbn=0-921031-28-9 [/tpl]"  His prescription was straightforward: after securing the goodwill of the lumber magnates, he would go about from lumber camp to lumber camp, and in each he would erect large tents called "Reading Tents." Each tent was then outfitted with books and stationed by Labourer-Teachers who were university students recruited to volunteer at the tents to teach the workers to read and write. Outside each tent was a sign that said "Reading Tent. All Welcome." Thus, the Reading Tent Association was born. It was later renamed Frontier College.
Over the years, with the changing face of Canada and the nature of its society and industries, Frontier College too adapted its programs in order to meet the learning needs of Canadians everywhere. In 1932, Frontier College began serving in British Columbia 'relief camps'. The range of its programs grew from serving labourers in isolated logging and mining camps or rail gangs, to assisting all constituents of Canadian society from adults working in factories and workshops, to children from low-income families needing help with their homework, street-involved youth determined to overcome their circumstances, and Aboriginal learners and communities.

==Legacy==

On 24 September 1999 Canada Post issued a stamp,'Frontier College, 1899-1999, Education for all,' based on a design by Renata Chubb, Glenda Rissman, and Peter D.K. Scott, based on an illustration by Alain Massicotte. The 46¢ stamps are perforated 13 x 13.5 and were printed by Canadian Bank Note Company, Limited.[tpl]cite web |url=http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(College.TITP.)+Or+(College.TITI.+And+null.B742.)&l=20&d=STMP&p=1&u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&r=6&f=G&Sect1=STMP |title=Canadian Postal Archives Database |date=24 September 1999 |author= |publisher=Canada Post Corporation |accessdate=2012-12-16 [/tpl]

==Educational Philosophy==

True to its founding belief in universal rights to learning and education, Frontier College adheres to the principle of S.C.I.L. or Student-Centered Invidualized Learning (also known as Student-centred learning) in organizing its tutoring programs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.frontiercollege.ca/english/learn/literacy_philosophy.html |title=Philosophy of Learning |date= |author= |publisher=Frontier College |accessdate=2012-12-16 [/tpl]  This approach places the student or learner at the center of the relationship where the learner, instead of the tutor/teacher, determines the goals or objectives that are to be achieved.  In turn, the challenge is for the tutor/teacher to locate, organize or create and present learning material that is relevant to the student's/learner's goals, interests and experience.  This relationship helps ensures that both learner and tutor are responsible partners in the learning-tutoring process.

==Programs==

===Labourer-Teachers===

The Labourer-Teacher program is Frontier College's historical program. It began in 1902 and aimed to extend the rights to learning and education to labourers working in Canada's early mines, rail gangs and lumber camps, where the need was felt most sharply. Early Labourer-Teachers were mostly young men recruited from universities in Canada, who took up the challenge to work alongside the labourers by day and then teach them to read and write at night.
Founder Alfred Fitzpatrick captured the spirit of Frontier College with the following words:
"Whenever and wherever people shall have the occasion to congregate, then and there shall be the time, place and means of their education."
With the Labourer-Teacher program firmly established, Frontier College Labourer-Teachers went on to work in pioneer settlements in Northern Ontario and relief camps during the 1930s. Labourer-Teachers helped construct the Alaska Highway during World War II and played a role in the technological transfer within Canada's workforce during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. More recently, Frontier College has sent Labourer-Teachers to work in penitentiaries and farming communities.  Presently, Frontier College Labourer-Teachers work mainly with migrant workers from Mexico and the Caribbean that work on farms located in Southwestern Ontario.

===Aboriginal Communities===

Frontier College began working with Aboriginal communities in the 1960s, starting with a "community education program for the Inuit community in Frobisher Bay (now Iqaluit).  In 2006, it began managing and operating the Aboriginal Summer Literacy Camps,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wawataynews.ca/node/428 |title=Bartleman establishing literacy camps |date=June 2, 2005 |author= |publisher=Wawatay News |accessdate=2012-12-16 [/tpl] one of four literacy initiatives spearheaded by The Hon. James Bartleman, the 27th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, to support the development of literacy skills among First Nations children and youth living on isolated, fly-in only reserves in Northern Ontario.
A total of 36 camps were organized that year in 28 First Nations in the Nishnawbe Aski Nation and Grand Council of Treaty 3 territories.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.frontiercollege.ca/english/literacy/media_news.html#camps |title=News and Events |date= |author= |publisher=Frontier College |accessdate=2012-12-16 [/tpl] In 2007, it began a partnership with the Métis Nation of Ontario, and in 2008, extended the Aboriginal Summer Literacy Camps to other communities in Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec.

===Working with children and youth===

Frontier College works with community-based groups and organizations to set up programs for children. The programs vary from one region to another. The activities include Reading Circles, Tutoring (one-to-one, small group, and classroom helpers), Homework Clubs, and Summer Programs. Volunteers are recruited, screened and trained by the local Frontier College staff.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.frontiercollege.ca/english/learn/programs_children.html |title=Literacy Programs for Children and Youth at Frontier College |publisher=Frontier College |date= |accessdate=2012-10-18[/tpl]

===Working with adults===

Frontier College trains volunteer tutors to help individuals (i.e. learners) to improve their learning skills in such areas as reading, writing, mathematics, and English as an Additional Language (i.e. ESL). The learners might include adults with disabilities, inmates in federal institutions, domestic workers, young adults, migrant workers, and immigrants to Canada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.frontiercollege.ca/english/learn/programs_adults.html |title=Literacy Programs for Adults at Frontier College |publisher=Frontier College |date= |accessdate=2012-10-18[/tpl]
