CATEGORIES: Scottish malt whisky, Scotland-related lists, Alcohol-related lists, United Kingdom cuisine-related lists

Highland single malts are single malt Scotch whiskies produced in the Highland region of Scotland. This categorization includes the whiskies produced on the islands around the perimeter of Scotland (the Island single malts), except for Islay (see Islay whisky). Incongruously, the area also includes certain lowland areas in the North-East of the country such as Banffshire and Aberdeenshire.
