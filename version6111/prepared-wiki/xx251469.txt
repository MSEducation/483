Opercularia ampluscolonia is a freshwater, colonial, sessiline peritrich ciliate protist. This species of protist produces a branched stalk that is often delicately striate in a longitudinal direction. There can be more than ninety-seven zooids per branched stalk. Zooids reproduce asexually and form dense clusters at the ends of each branch. This filter feeding protist inhabits ponds in Mendocino County, California.
