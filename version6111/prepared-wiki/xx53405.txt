[[Areola]]

CATEGORIES: Breast anatomy

In anatomy, an areola ([tpl]IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|iː|əl|ə[/tpl]OED 2nd edition, 1989.Entry "areola" in Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. or [tpl]IPAc-en|ɛ|r|iː|'|oʊ|l|ə[/tpl]) is any small circular area on the body coloured differently from the surrounding tissue. The term is most commonly used to describe the pigmented area on the human breast around the nipple (areola mammae) but it can also be used to describe other small circular areas such as the inflamed region surrounding a pimple.
The plural of "areola", is "areolæ"/"areolae", which is pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|iː|əl|i:[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|iː|əl|aɪ[/tpl]. "Areola" is the diminutive of Latin area, "open place".

==Human mammary areola==

Careful inspection of a mature human female nipple will reveal several small openings arranged radially around the tip of the nipple (lactiferous ducts) from which milk is released during lactation. Other small openings in the areola are sebaceous glands, known as Montgomery's glands (or glands of Montgomery),PLOS ONE: The Secretion of Areolar (Montgomery's) Glands from Lactating Women Elicits Selective, Unconditional Responses in Neonates These can be quite obvious and raised above the surface of the areola, giving the appearance of "goose-flesh".

===Color===

The areola can range from pink to red to dark brown or nearly black, but generally tend to be paler among people with lighter skin tones and darker among people with darker skin tones.
Additionally, it has been claimed that a reason for the differing color is to make the nipple area more visible to the infant.What the Color of Your Areola Tells About You | Yahoo! Health

===Size and shape===

The size and shape of areolae are also highly variable, with those of sexually mature women usually being larger than those of men and prepubescent girls. Human areolae are mostly circular in shape, but many women and some men have areolae that are noticeably elliptical.
The average diameter of male areolae is around [tpl]convert|25|mm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Sexually mature women have an average of [tpl]convert|38.1|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl], but sizes range up to [tpl]convert|100|mm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl] or greater.[tpl]cite journal |first=M. |last=Hussain |first2=L. |last2=Rynn |first3=C. |last3=Riordan |first4=P.

Rated according to the Tanner scale of physical development, in stage four, the areolæ are raised.[tpl]cite book|last1=Le|first1=Tao|last2=Bhushan |first2=Vikas |last3=Tolles |first3=Juliana |title=First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 2011|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical[/tpl] In stage five, they are no longer raised.
