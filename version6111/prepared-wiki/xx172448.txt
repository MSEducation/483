[[MST Workshop]]

CATEGORIES: Visual programming languages

The MST Workshop (short for Math Science and Technology Workshop') is an interactive computer programming language. It has hundreds of objects that can be dragged on to the workspace and connected by wires or snapping them together. The workspace immediately solves the equations created and displays the results. MST Workshop is useful for creating animation in 2D and 3D (using OpenGL).
MST Workshop uses components to process data. These components are connected when their terminals touch or when a virtual wire is connected between them. The interactive nature becomes apparent when components are connected. The color of the connected components changes from gray to a color specific to the value of the data passed through the connection. Components calculate in real time. Certain components that require a time frame can be started and stopped by buttons in the toolbar. Examples of time dependent components are the timer, oneshot, and the integration-over-time component.
