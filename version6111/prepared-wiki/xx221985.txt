George Lynford Throop (born November 24, 1950, at Pasadena, California) is a retired American professional baseball player. A right-handed pitcher, Throop appeared in 30 games — all in relief — over parts of four Major League seasons between [tpl]By|1975[/tpl] and [tpl]By|1979[/tpl].  He was listed at [tpl]convert|6|ft|7|in[/tpl] tall and weighed [tpl]convert|205|lb[/tpl].
Throop was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the 16th round of the 1972 Major League Baseball Draft after attending Pasadena City College and California State University, Long Beach. He spent nearly his entire career with the Royals organization. However, about half of his career appearances in the Major Leagues, and more than half of his 42[tpl]frac|1|3[/tpl] MLB innings pitched, came after a trade to the Houston Astros in April 1979.
He allowed 41 hits and 25 bases on balls, and notched three saves to accompany his three wins as a big-leaguer.
