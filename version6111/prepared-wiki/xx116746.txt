</ref> Longer myths, such as the ''[[Epic of King Gesar]]'', were important vehicles for the transmission of shamanic traditions. [[Oirad]] epics relayed in üligers are [[Jangar]], the history of the four Oirad's Victory over the Mongols, Khan Kharangui, Bum Erdene, etc.
The Epic of King Gesar is not only a part of Mongolian folklore but is also engrained in Tibetan and Chinese history. However, given the oral nature of the genre, a large number of variants have always existed, and no canonical text can be given. Despite the age of the tradition dating to the 15th century, the tale was put into Mongolian woodblock print, commissioned by the Qing Emperor Kangxi in 1716. In the late 19th/early 20th century a woodblock edition of the story was compiled by a scholarly monk from Lingtsang. Üligers of King Gesar have even been told as far west as the Caspian Sea, reaching Europe with the Tibetan Buddhist Kalmyk people.
Chinese and Tibetan literature also underlies the Üliger-iin Dalai (The Ocean of Parables, see also Kathāsaritsāgara), a collection of Buddhist birth stories (including the set of stories "The Wise Man and the Fool") edited in 1837 by O. Kowalewski.[ref]
</ref> There is some scholarly debate as to whether a Chinese<ref>
</ref> or a Tibetan<ref>
</ref> version of "The Wise Man and the Fool" is the direct source for the Mongolian text, but while there are small variations, on the whole the Mongolian version is quite faithful to its originals.<ref name="yoshitake"/>
