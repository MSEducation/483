==History==

Jefferson County was established on December 13, 1819, by the Alabama Legislature. It was named in honor of Thomas Jefferson. The county is located in the north-central portion of the state, on the southmost edge of the Appalachian Mountains, in the center of the (former) iron, coal, and limestone mining belt of the Southern United States. Jefferson County is bordered by Blount County, Bibb County, St. Clair County, Shelby County, Tuscaloosa County, and Walker County, in Alabama. Jefferson County has a land area of about [tpl]convert|1119|sqmi|km2[/tpl]. Well-before Birmingham was even founded (in 1871), the county seat of Jefferson County was located at Carrollsville (1819 – 21) and Elyton (1821 – 73), and since 1873 it has been located in Birmingham, which was named for the English city of the same name in Warwickshire. That city had long been a center of iron and steel production in Great Britain. Note that Elyton has long been a part of Birmingham itself, since Birmingham was established by the merger of three towns, and the city has a long history of annexing its neighboring towns and villages, including North Birmingham.

===Sewer construction and bond swap controversy===

Two extremely controversial undertakings in the 2000s left the county in extreme debt, eventually leading to a 2011 bankruptcy. First was a massive overhaul of the county-owned sewer system, and second was a series of risky bond-swap agreements. Both have been scrutinized by federal prosecutors, with several former county officials convicted of bribery and corruption.Former Jefferson County Commissioner Gary White sentenced to 10 years in prison. al.com.

A series of controversial interest rate swaps, initiated in 2002 and 2003 by former Commission President Larry Langford (removed as the mayor of Birmingham after his convictionLarry Langford Impact – Page 3 – - Larry Langford trial | Latest Larry Langford News. al.com. Retrieved on 2011-03-02.), were intended to lower interest payments, but in fact, had the opposite effect, increasing the county's indebtedness to the point that a bankruptcy ensued. The bond swaps were at the center of an investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Wright, Barnett |date=December 18, 2007 |title=SEC wants to force Larry Langford, Bill Blount to testify in Jefferson County bond swap deals |publisher=Birmingham News[/tpl]
In late February 2008 Standard & Poor's lowered their rating of Jefferson County bonds to "junk" status. The likelihood of the county filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection was then debated in the press.Hubbard, Russell (March 2, 2008) "Jefferson County finance options likely to be expensive." Birmingham News  In early March 2008, Moody's followed suit and indicated that it would also review the county's ability to meet other bond obligations.[tpl]cite web |author=Hubbard, Russell |date=March 4, 2008 |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/03/update_jefferson_county_financ.html |title=Update: Jefferson County finances take another hit |publisher=Birmingham News[/tpl]
On March 7, 2008, Jefferson County failed to post $184 million collateral as required under its sewer bond agreements, thereby moving into technical default.Wright, Barnett (March 8, 2008) "Jefferson County, Alabama sewer debt swap agreement deadline passes." Birmingham News
In February 2011, Lesley Curwen of the BBC World Service interviewed David Carrington, the newly appointed president of the county commission, about the risk of defaulting on bonds issued to finance “what could be the most expensive sewage system in history.” Carrington said there was “no doubt that people from Wall Street offered bribes” and “have to take a huge responsibility for what happened.”  Wall Street investment banks including JP Morgan and others arranged complex financial deals using swaps. The fees and penalty charges increased the cost so the county in 2011 had $3.2 billion outstanding. Carrington said one of the problems was that elected officials had welcomed scheduling with very low early payments so long as peak payments occurred after they left office.
The SEC has awarded the county $75 million in compensation relation to “unlawful payments” against JP Morgan and in addition the company will forfeit $647 million of future fees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/p00dy3z5/Business_Daily_Alabamas_sewer_debts|publisher =BBC World Service|title=Business Daily Alabama's sewerdebt|date=28 February 2011|accessdate=2 March 2011[/tpl]

===2011 Bankruptcy filing===

Jefferson County filed for bankruptcy on November 9, 2011. Valued at $4.2 billion, with debts of $3.14 billion relating to sewer work, this was at the time the most expensive municipal bankruptcy ever in the U.S., surpassed only by the Detroit bankruptcy filed in 2013.[tpl]cite web |title=The scandal of the Alabama poor cut off from water |author=Brian Wheeler |work=BBC News |date=14 December 2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16037798 |accessdate=2011-12-15[/tpl] The County requested Chapter 9 relief under federal statute 11 U.S.C. §921.

==Government==

Jefferson County is one of the eight counties in Alabama with a limited-form of home rule government. It allows the county to be able to set up a zoning system for land use, maintain the sanitary sewer, sewerage systems and highways, provide for garbage and trash disposal, and to enforce taxation (except for property taxes). The county is governed by a five-member commission that combines the legislative and executive duties for the county. The Commissioners are elected by a vote of the districts which they represent, rather than by an "at large" election. Each county commissioner represents one of the five individual districts in the county.  By votes in the commission, the commissioners are given executive responsibilities for the various county departments, which fall under the categories of "Roads and Transportation", "Community Development", "Environmental Services", "Health and Human Services", "Technlogy and Land Development", and "Finance and General Services". The County Commission elects its own President, who is the chairman of all County Commission meetings, and who has additional executive duties.

===Taxation===

Sales tax on many items within the county can be as high as 12%. In January 2005, a controversial addition 1% educational sales tax for the funding of construction of education facilities came into effect. This tax was approved by a 3–2 vote by the County Commission in October 2004.  This additional 1¢ has led county municipalities such as Fairfield to have sales tax rates as high as 10%, while other municipalities and incorporated communities saw an increase in their total sales tax rate from 8% to 9%.  It should be noted that the state of Alabama sales tax is 4% and Jefferson County's is 2% in total.[tpl]when|date=August 2013[/tpl] Municipal sales taxes go as high as 4%.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]

===Law===

Jefferson County is served by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department. The County Sheriff is chosen by the eligible voters in an "at large" election. The Sheriff's Department fields about 175 deputy sheriffs who patrol the unincorporated areas of the county, and also all municipalities that do not have their own police departments. The Sheriff's Department has two county jails, one in Birmingham and one in Bessemer that detain suspects awaiting trial (who cannot afford to post bail)  and other ones who are serving sentences less than one year in length.
There are two judicial courthouses in Jefferson County, a situation dating back to when the state legislature was making preparations to split off a portion of Jefferson County to create a new county, centered around Bessemer. The split never happened because there was no way for the proposed new county  to have enough area—a minimum of 500 square miles—to meet the requirement of the Alabama State Constitution.  The additional county courthouse and some parallel functions remain in service. The main courthouse is in Birmingham and the second one is located in Bessemer. There are elected officials who maintain offices in the Bessemer annex, such as the county's Assistant Tax Collector, the Assistant Tax Assessor, and the Assistant District Attorney.

==Education==

Except for cities such as Birmingham  that have established their own local school districts, all parts of Jefferson County are served by Jefferson County Board of Education. Parts within Birmingham are served by Birmingham City Schools.  Other cities in the county that have established their own school systems are Bessemer, Fairfield, Midfield, Trussville, Homewood, Leeds, Hoover, Vestavia Hills, Tarrant, and Mountain Brook.

==Geography==
