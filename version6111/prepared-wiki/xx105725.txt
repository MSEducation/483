CATEGORIES: Hoobastank albums, 1998 albums

They Sure Don't Make Basketball Shorts Like They Used To is a 1998 self-released album produced by Hoobastank (then known as "Hoobustank"). It is significantly different from "modern" Hoobastank as its songs fit more into the genres of funk rock and ska punk rather than alternative rock and post-grunge, especially through extensive use of a saxophone.
