The Kosovo Liberation Army (abbreviated KLA; [tpl]Lang-sq|Ushtria Çlirimtare e Kosovës[/tpl]—[tpl]Lang|sq|UÇK[/tpl]) was an ethnic-Albanian military organization which sought the separation of Kosovo from Yugoslavia during the 1990s.
Its campaign against Yugoslav security forces precipitated a major Yugoslav military crackdown which led to the Kosovo War of 1998–1999. Military intervention by Yugoslav security forces led by Slobodan Milošević and Serb militia within Kosovo prompted an exodus of Kosovar Albanians/Serbs and a refugee crisis that eventually caused NATO to intervene militarily in order to stop what was widely identified as an ongoing campaign of ethnic cleansing.UNDER ORDERS: War Crimes in Kosovo – 4.

The conflict was ended by an "almost-imposed" negotiated agreement that requested the UN to take over the administration and political process, including local institutional building and determine the final status of the region.
The United States then cultivated diplomatic relationships with the KLA leaders. In 1999 the KLA was officially disbanded and their members entered other armed groups such as various Albanian Macedonian rebels,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/kla-veterans-linked-to-latest--bout-of-violence-in-macedonia-686995.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=KLA veterans linked to latest bout of violence in Macedonia | first=Justin | last=Huggler | date=12 March 2001 | accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl] the UCPMB in the Preševo Valley region[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/676196.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kosovo one year on | date=16 March 2000 | accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl] and UNMIK instituted NGOs within Kosovo such as the Kosovo Protection Corps (in accordance with UNSC resolution 1244 which required the establishment of a civilian emergency protection body to replace the former KLA) and Kosovo Police Force.[tpl]cite book|author=Perritt, Henry H. |title=Kosovo Liberation Army: The Inside Story of an Insurgency|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SlHqkxGk4Q8C|year= 2008|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-09213-8[/tpl] Some of the Kosovo Liberation Army leadership opted to enter politics, and by taking advantage of the 1999 confusion they still lead the Albanian faction of the partially recognized Kosovar government.

==History==

===First attacks===

In February 1996 the KLA undertook a series of attacks against police stations and Yugoslav government officers, saying that they had killed Albanian civilians as part of an ethnic cleansing campaign."Unknown Albanian 'liberation army' claims attacks", Agence France Presse, 17 February 1996 Serbian authorities denounced the KLA as a terrorist organization and increased the number of security forces in the region. This had the counter-productive effect of boosting the credibility of the embryonic KLA among the Kosovo Albanian population.
According to Roland Keith, a field office director of the OSCE's Kosovo Verification Mission:"Failure of Diplomacy, Returning OSCE Human Rights Monitor Offers A View From the Ground in Kosovo", The Democrat, May 1999, Roland Keith
According to the report of the U.S. Committee for Refugees:[tpl]cite book | title= Reporting war: journalism in wartime |author= Allan, Stuart and Zelizer, Barbie |publisher= Routledge |year= 2004|isbn= 0-415-33998-7 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=skdoYDs1e8AC&pg=PA178|page=178 [/tpl][tpl]Verify credibility|date=May 2012[/tpl]
The Yugoslav Red Cross had estimated a total of 30,000 refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Kosovo, most of whom were Serb. The UNHCR estimated the figure at 55,000 refugees who had fled to Montenegro and Central Serbia, most of whom were Kosovo Serbs:
The NATO North Atlantic Council had stressed that KLA was "the main initiator of the violence" and that it had "launched what appears to be a deliberate campaign of provocation".[tpl]Verify credibility|date=May 2012[/tpl]

===Foreign volunteers===

The KLA included in its ranks foreign volunteers from Italy, the UK, Germany, Albania, and the USIWPR Institute for War & Peace Reporting. Iwpr.net (11 November 2001).

===Aftermath (post-1999)===

After the war, the KLA was transformed into the Kosovo Protection Corps, which worked alongside NATO forces patrolling the province. The KLA legacy remains powerful within Kosovo. Its former members still play a major role in Kosovar politics.
Ali Ahmeti organized the NLA that fought in the Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia, of former KLA fighters from Kosovo and Macedonia, Albanian insurgents from Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac in Serbia, young Albanian radicals and nationalists from Macedonia, and foreign mercenaries.[tpl]cite book|title=Media Discourse and the Yugoslav Conflicts: Representations of Self and Other|author=Pål Kolstø|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2009|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jGNWORa2QccC|isbn=0754676293|page=173[/tpl] The acronym was the same as KLA's in Albanian.
Its former political head Hashim Thaçi is now the leader of the Democratic Party of Kosovo and the Prime Minister of Kosovo since January 2008.
The KLA's former military head, Agim Çeku, after the war became Prime Minister of Kosovo. The move caused some controversy in Serbia, as Belgrade regarded him as a war criminal, though he was never indicted by the Hague tribunal.Benner, Jeffrey (21 May 1999) [tpl]Wayback |date=20050315211013 |url=http://www.motherjones.com/news/special_reports/total_coverage/kosovo/ceku.html |title=War Criminal, Ally, or Both?

Hajredin Bala, an ex-KLA prison guard, was sentenced on 30 November 2005 to 13 years’ imprisonment for the mistreatment of three prisoners at the Llapushnik prison camp, his personal role in the "maintenance and enforcement of the inhumane conditions" of the camp, aiding the torture of one prisoner, and of participating in the murder of nine prisoners from the camp who were marched to the Berisha Mountains on 25 or 26 July 1998 and killed.

==Foreign support==

In 1996 the British weekly The European carried an article by a French expert stating that "German civil and military intelligence services have been involved in training and equipping the rebels with the aim of cementing German influence in the Balkan area. (...) The birth of the KLA in 1996 coincided with the appointment of Hansjoerg Geiger as the new head of the BND (German secret Service). (...) The BND men were in charge of selecting recruits for the KLA command structure from the 500,000 Kosovars in Albania."Fallgot, Roger (1998): "How Germany Backed KLA", in The European, 21 – 27 September. pp. 21–27. Former senior adviser to the German parliament Matthias Küntzel tried to prove later on that German secret diplomacy had been instrumental in helping the KLA since its creation.Küntzel, Matthias (2002): Der Weg in den Krieg. Deutschland, die Nato und das Kosovo (The Road to War. Germany, Nato and Kosovo). Elefanten Press. Berlin, Germany. pp. 59–64 ISBN 3885207710.
James Bissett, Canadian Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Albania, wrote in 1990 that media reports indicate that "as early as 1998, the Central Intelligence Agency assisted by the British Special Air Service were arming and training Kosovo Liberation Army members in Albania to foment armed rebellion in Kosovo. (...) The hope was that with Kosovo in flames NATO could intervene ..."Bissett, James (31 July 2001) [tpl]Wayback |date=20080510052014 |url=http://www.deltax.net/bissett/a-monster.htm |title=WE CREATED A MONSTER [/tpl].

New Haven, USA. p. 120 ISBN 0300097255 and according to The Sunday Times, "American intelligence agents have admitted they helped to train the Kosovo Liberation Army before NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia"." CIA aided Kosovo guerrilla army" by Tom Walker and Aidan Laverty. THE SUNDAY TIMES, London, UK 12 March 2000 Intelligence agents denied, however, that they were involved in arming the KLA.
American Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, while opposed to American ground troops in Kosovo, advocated for America providing support to the Kosovo Liberation to help them gain their freedom.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8hGwXHr0eNEC&pg=PA7742|title=Congressional Record|author=Congress|year=1999|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=|isbn=9780160730078|page=7743|pages=|accessdate=3 May 2011[/tpl] He was honored by the Albanian American Civic League at a New Jersey located fundraising event on 23 July 2001. President of the League, Joseph J. DioGuardi, praised Rohrabacher for his support to the Kosovo Liberation Army, saying "He was the first member of Congress to insist that the United States arm the Kosovo Liberation Army, and one of the few members who to this day publicly supports the independence of Kosovo."[tpl]cite news|title=Rohrabacher Shills for the KLA.(Rep Dana Rohrabacher and the Kosovo Liberation Army)(Brief Article)|author=The New American|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-79789123.html|newspaper=The New American|date=4 May 2001|accessdate=7 January 2011[/tpl] Rohrabacher gave a speech in support of American equipping the KLA with weaponry, comparing it to French support of America in the Revolutionary War, saying "Based on our own experience, the Kosovo Liberation Army should have been armed." "If the U.S. had armed the KLA in 1998, we would not be where we are today.

==Reported abuses==

There have been reports of war crimes committed by the KLA both during and after the conflict. These have been directed against Serbs, other ethnic minorities (primarily the Roma) and against ethnic Albanians accused of collaborating with Serb authorities.Human Rights Watch, UNDER ORDERS:War Crimes in Kosovo. hrw.org (2001) According to a 2001 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW):
 The KLA was responsible for serious abuses… including abductions and murders of Serbs and ethnic Albanians considered collaborators with the state.
 Elements of the KLA are also responsible for post-conflict attacks on Serbs, Roma, and other non-Albanians, as well as ethnic Albanian political rivals... widespread and systematic burning and looting of homes belonging to Serbs, Roma, and other minorities and the destruction of Orthodox churches and monasteries... combined with harassment and intimidation designed to force people from their homes and communities... elements of the KLA are clearly responsible for many of these crimes.
The KLA engaged in tit-for-tat attacks against Serbian nationalists in Kosovo, reprisals against ethnic Albanians who "collaborated" with the Serbian government, and bombed police stations and cafes known to be frequented by Serb officials, killing innocent civilians in the process. Most of its activities were funded by drug running, though its ties to community groups and Albanian exiles gave it local popularity.Council on Foreign Relations, Terrorist Groups and Political Legitimacy, 16 March 2006
The Yugoslav authorities regarded the KLA as a terrorist group,[tpl]Wayback |date=20070402053051 |url=http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3517 |title=MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base[/tpl] using a web.archive.org copy of 2 April 2007 though many European governments did not. The Serbian government also reported that the KLA had killed and kidnapped no fewer than 3,276 civilians of various ethnic descriptions including some Albanians.Victims of the Albanian terrorism in Kosovo-Metohija (Killed, kidnapped, and missing persons, January 1998 – November 2001) Žrtve albanskog terorizma na Kosovu i Metohiji (Ubijena, oteta i nestala lica, januar 1998 – novembar 2001). arhiva.srbija.gov.rs
The exact number of victims of the KLA is not known. According to a Serbian government report, from 1 January 1998 to 10 June 1999 the KLA killed 988 people and kidnapped 287; in the period from 10 June 1999 to 11 November 2001, when NATO took control in Kosovo, 847 were reported to have been killed and 1,154 kidnapped. This comprised both civilians and security force personnel: of those killed in the first period, 335 were civilians, 351 soldiers, 230 police and 72 were unidentified; by nationality, 87 of the killed civilians were Serbs, 230 Albanians, and 18 of other nationalities. Following the withdrawal of Serbian and Yugoslav security forces from Kosovo in June 1999, all casualties were civilians, the vast majority being Serbs. According to Human Rights Watch, as “many as one thousand Serbs and Roma have been murdered or have gone missing since June 12, 1999.”UNDER ORDERS: War Crimes in Kosovo. executive summary. hrw.org (2001)
The Podujevo bus bombing was a terrorist attack on a civilian bus in a Serb-populated area near the town of Podujevo, Kosovo on 16 February 2001 by Kosovar Albanian extremists.
Carla Del Ponte, a long-time ICTY chief prosecutor, claimed in her book The Hunt: Me and the War Criminals that there were instances of organ trafficking in 1999 after the end of the Kosovo War. These allegations were dismissed by Kosovar and Albanian authorities.The Daily Telegraph, Serb prisoners 'were stripped of their organs in Kosovo war', 14 April 2008 The allegations have been rejected by Kosovar authorities as fabrications while the ICTY has said "no reliable evidence had been obtained to substantiate the allegations".International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia – TPIY. Un.org (5 March 2007). Retrieved on 14 March 2013.
In early 2011 the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs viewed a report by Dick Marty on the alleged criminal activities and alleged organ harvesting controversy; however, the Members of Parliament criticized the report, citing lack of evidence, and Marty responded that a witness protection program was needed in Kosovo before he could provide more details on witnesses because their lives were in danger.Politician angers MEPs over Kosovo organ harvesting claim (The Irish Times) Investigations are still being done.

==Status as a terrorist group==

The Yugoslav authorities, under Slobodan Milošević, regarded the KLA as a terrorist group. In February 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy to the Balkans, Robert Gelbard, condemned both the actions of the Serb government and of the KLA, and described the KLA as "without any questions, a terrorist group".The Kosovo Liberation Army: Does Clinton Policy Support Group with Terror, Drug Ties?

During the war, the KLA troops collaborated with the NATO troops, and they were qualified by NATO as "freedom fighters". In late 1999 the KLA was disbanded and its members entered the Kosovo Protection Corps.Reveron, p. 68

==Drug and arms trafficking==
