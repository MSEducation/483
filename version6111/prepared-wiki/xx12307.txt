One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is a mention of a land named Gangaridai by the Ancient Greeks around 100 BC. The word is speculated to have come from Gangahrd (Land with the Ganges in its heart) in reference to an area in Bengal. Bengal had overseas trade relations with Suvarnabhumi (Burma, Lower Thailand, Lower Malay Peninsula, and the Sumatra).[tpl]cite book |title=Foreign trade and commerce in ancient India |last=Prasad |first= Prakash Chandra|year= 2003|publisher=Abhinav Publications |location= New Delhi|isbn=978-81-7017-053-2 |page=28|url=http://books.google.com/?id=mFW3sXnzEQ4C&pg=PA231&dq=ancient+history+of+bengal+trade#v=onepage&q=bengal&f=false |accessdate=13 September 2010[/tpl] According to Mahavamsa, Vijaya Singha, a Vanga prince, conquered Lanka (modern day Sri Lanka) and gave the name "Sinhala" to the country.[tpl]cite book |last=Geiger |first= Wilhelm| authorlink=Wilhelm Geiger|title=Mahavamsa: Great Chronicle of Ceylon |url= http://books.google.com/?id=nX2af3kcregC&printsec=frontcover&dq=wilhelm+geiger#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=2 March 2012 |year= 2003|origyear=1908 |publisher=Asian Educational Services|location=New Delhi |isbn= 81-206-0218-8|chapter=Chapter VI: The Coming of Viajaya |chapterurl= http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap006.html|pages=51–54[/tpl]
After a period of anarchy, the Buddhist Pala dynasty ruled the region for four hundred years, followed by a shorter reign of the Hindu Sena dynasty. Some areas of Bengal were invaded by Rajendra Chola I of Chola Dynasty between 1021 and 1023.[tpl]cite book|last=Sengupta|first=Nitish K.|title=Land of two rivers: a history of Bengal from the Mahabharata to Mujib|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kVSh_TyJ0YoC&pg=PA45|publisher=Penguin Books India| year=2011|isbn=978-0-14-341678-4|page=45[/tpl] Islam made its first appearance in Bengal during the 12th century when Sufi missionaries arrived. Later, occasional Muslim raiders reinforced the process of conversion by building mosques, madrassas and Sufi Khanqah. Between 1202 and 1206, Bakhtiar Khilji, a military commander from the Delhi Sultanate, overran Bihar and Bengal as far east as Rangpur, Bogra and the Brahmaputra River. Although he failed to bring Bengal under his control, the expedition managed to defeat Lakshman Sen and his two sons moved to a place then called Vikramapur (present-day Munshiganj District), where their diminished dominion lasted until the late 13th century.
During the 14th century, the former kingdom became known as the Sultanate of Bengal, ruled intermittently with the Sultanate of Delhi as well as powerful Hindu states and land-lords-Baro-Bhuyans. The Hindu Deva Kingdom ruled over eastern Bengal after the collapse Sena Empire. The Sultanate of Bengal was interrupted by an uprising by the Hindus under Raja Ganesha. The Ganesha dynasty began in 1414, but his successors converted to Islam. Bengal came once more under the control of Delhi as the Mughals conquered it in 1576. There were several independent Hindu states established in Bengal during the Mughal period like those of Maharaja Pratap Aditya of Jessore and Raja Sitaram Ray of Burdwan. These kingdoms contributed greatly to the economic and cultural landscape of Bengal. Extensive land reclamations in forested and marshy areas were carried out and trade as well as commerce were highly encouraged. These kingdoms also helped introduce new music, painting, dancing and sculpture into Bengali art-forms as well as many temples were constructed during this period. Militarily, they served as bulwarks against Portuguese and Burmese attacks. Koch Bihar Kingdom in the northern Bengal, flourished during the period of 16th and the 17th centuries as well as weathered the Mughals and survived till the advent of the British.
European traders arrived late in the fifteenth century. Their influence grew until the British East India Company gained taxation rights in Bengal subah, or province, following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, when Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab, was defeated by the British. The Bengal Presidency was established by 1765, eventually including all British territories north of the Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh), from the mouths of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra to the Himalayas and the Punjab. The Bengal famine of 1770 claimed millions of lives. Calcutta was named the capital of British India in 1772. The Bengal Renaissance and Brahmo Samaj socio-cultural reform movements had great impact on the cultural and economic life of Bengal. The failed Indian rebellion of 1857 started near Calcutta and resulted in transfer of authority to the British Crown, administered by the Viceroy of India.[tpl]Harv|Baxter|1997|pp=30–32[/tpl] Between 1905 and 1911, an abortive attempt was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones.[tpl]Harv|Baxter|1997|pp=39–40[/tpl] Bengal suffered from the Great Bengal famine in 1943 that claimed 3 million lives.[tpl]cite book |title=India |last= Wolpert|first= Stanley|authorlink=Stanley Wolpert |year= 1999|publisher= University of California Press|location= Berkeley, California, USA|isbn= 978-0-520-22172-7|page=14 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=nHnOERqf-MQC|accessdate=2 March 2012[/tpl]
Bengal played a major role in the Indian independence movement, in which revolutionary groups such as Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were dominant. Armed attempts against the British Raj from Bengal reached a climax when Subhas Chandra Bose led the Indian National Army from Southeast Asia against the British. When India gained independence in 1947, Bengal was partitioned along religious lines. The western part went to India (and was named West Bengal) while the eastern part joined Pakistan as a province called East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan, giving rise to independent Bangladesh in 1971).[tpl]cite web|first= Sirajul|last=Islam |url=http://www.banglapedia.org/httpdocs/HT/P_0101.HTM |title=Partition of Bengal, 1947 |work=Banglapedia|publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|accessdate=3 March 2012[/tpl] In 1950, the Princely State of Cooch Behar merged with West Bengal.Sailen Debnath, ed.

Both West and East Bengal suffered from large refugee influx during and after the partition in 1947. Refugee settlement and related issues continued to play significant role in the politics and socio-economic condition of the state.Sailen Debnath, 'West Bengal in Doldrums'ISBN 978-81-86860-34-2; & Sailen Debnath ed.

During the 1970s and 1980s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent Marxist-Naxalite movement damaged much of the state's infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation. The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 resulted in the influx of millions of refugees to West Bengal, causing significant strains on its infrastructure.[tpl]Harv|Hindle|1996|pp=63–70[/tpl] The 1974 smallpox epidemic killed thousands. West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the Left Front won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent Indian National Congress. The Left Front, led by Communist Party of India (Marxist), governed for the state for the subsequent three decades.[ref]

The state's economic recovery gathered momentum after economic reforms were introduced in the mid-1990s by the central government, aided by the advent of information technology and IT-enabled services. As of 2007, armed activists have been conducting minor terrorist attacks in some parts of the state, while clashes with the administration are taking place at several sensitive places over the issue of industrial land acquisition.[ref]
