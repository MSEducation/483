Colchicine is a medication that treats gout. It is a toxic natural product and secondary metabolite, originally extracted from plants of the genus Colchicum (autumn crocus, Colchicum autumnale, also known as "meadow saffron"). It was used originally to treat rheumatic complaints, especially gout, and still finds use for these purposes today despite dosing issues concerning its toxicity.[tpl]cite web |work=National Prescribing Service |url=http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/publications/nps_radar/2010/may_2010/brief_item_colchicine |date=14 May 2010 |title=Colchicine for acute gout: updated information about dosing and drug interactions |accessdate=14 May 2010[/tpl] It was also prescribed for its cathartic and emetic effects.
In addition to gout, colchicine is used to treat familial Mediterranean fever, pericarditis, and Behçet's disease.

==History==

The plant source of colchicine, the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale), was described for treatment of rheumatism and swelling in the Ebers Papyrus (ca. 1500 B.C.), an Egyptian medical papyrus.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://ard.bmj.com/content/12/1/16.full.pdf|title=Intravenous colchicine in the treatment of gouty arthritis|author=Wallace Graham and James B. Roberts|journal=Ann Rheum Dis|year=1953|volume=12|pages=16–19|doi=10.1136/ard.12.1.16|pmid=13031443|issue=1|pmc=1030428[/tpl] Colchicum extract was first described as a treatment for gout in De Materia Medica by Pedanius Dioscorides, in the first century AD. Use of the bulb-like corms of  Colchicum to treat gout probably dates to ca. 550 AD, as the "hermodactyl" recommended by Alexander of Tralles. Colchicum corms were used by the Persian physician Avicenna and other Islamic physicians,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] were recommended by Ambroise Pare in the sixteenth century, and appeared in the London Pharmacopoeia of 1618.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://ard.bmj.com/content/13/3/190.full.pdf|doi= 10.1136/ard.13.3.190|title=History of the Use of Colchicum and related Medicaments in Gout|journal=Ann Rheum Dis|year=1954|volume=13|pages=190–200|author=Edward F. Hartung|issue=3[/tpl] (free BMJ registration required) Colchicum plants were brought to America by Benjamin Franklin, who suffered from gout himself and had written humorous doggerel about the disease during his stint as Envoy to France.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=CMJKgfhCKzIC&pg=PA275&lpg=PA275|title=Pharmacodynamic basis of herbal medicine|author=Manuchair S.

Colchicine was first isolated in 1820 by the French chemists P.S. Pelletier and J.B.Caventou.Pelletier and Caventou (1820) "Examen chimique des plusieurs végétaux de la famille des colchicées, et du principe actif qu'ils renferment.  (veratrum sabadilla) ; hellébore blanc (veratrum album) ; colchique commun (colchicum autumnale)"  (Chemical examination of several plants of the meadow saffron family, and of the active principle that they contain.) Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 14 : 69-81. In 1833, P.L. Geiger purified an active ingredient, which he named colchicine.Geiger, Ph. L. (1833) "Ueber einige neue giftige organische Alkalien" (On some new poisonous organic alkalis) Annalen der Pharmacie, 7 (3) : 269-280; colchicine is discussed on pages 274-276. The determination of colchicine's structure required decades, although in 1945 Michael Dewar made an important contribution when he suggested that, among the molecule's three rings, two were 7-member rings.Dewar, Michael J.S. (February 3, 1945) "Letters to Editor:  Structure of colchicine," Nature 155 : 141-142. Note:  Dewar did not prove the structure of colchicine; he merely suggested that it contained two 7-membered rings. Colchicine's structure was determined by X-ray crystallography in 1952 Vernon King, J. L. de Vries, and Ray Pepinsky (July 1952) "An x-ray diffraction determination of the chemical structure of colchicine," Acta Crystallographica, 5 : 437-440. Its total synthesis was first accomplished in 1959 Eschenmoser (1959) "Synthese des Colchicins," Angewandte Chemie, 71 : 637-640. Its pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects for gout were linked to its ability to bind with tubulin.

===FDA approval===

Oral colchicine had been used for many years as an unapproved drug with no prescribing information, dosage recommendations, or drug interaction warnings approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/706814 |date=July 2009 |title= FDA Approves Colchicine With Drug Interaction and Dose Warnings [/tpl] On July 30, 2009 the FDA approved colchicine as a monotherapy for the treatment of three different indications (familial Mediterranean fever, acute gout flares, and for the prophylaxis of gout flares), and gave URL Pharma a three-year marketing exclusivity agreementhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/default.cfm FDA Orange Book; search for colchicine in exchange for URL Pharma doing 17 new studies and investing $100 million into the product, of which $45 million went to the FDA for the application fee.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===

Colchicine inhibits microtubule polymerization by binding to tubulin, one of the main constituents of microtubules. Availability of tubulin is essential to mitosis, and therefore colchicine effectively functions as a "mitotic poison" or spindle poison.Cyberbotanica: Colchicine
The mitosis inhibiting function of colchicine has been of great use in the study of cellular genetics.  To see the chromosomes of a cell under a light microscope, it is important that they be viewed near the point in the cell cycle in which they are most dense.  This occurs near the middle of mitosis (specifically metaphase), so mitosis must be stopped before it completes.  Adding colchicine to a culture during mitosis is part of the standard procedure for doing karyotype studies.
Apart from inhibiting mitosis (a process heavily dependent on cytoskeletal changes), colchicine also inhibits neutrophil motility and activity, leading to a net anti-inflammatory effect. This has proven useful in the treatment of acute gout flares.

===Indications===

Colchicine has a relatively low therapeutic index.  In August 2009, colchicine won Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the United States as a stand-alone drug for the treatment of acute flares of gout and familial Mediterranean fever.FDA Approves Gout Treatment After Long Years of Use, an August 2009 article from MedPage Today[tpl]cite journal |author=Cerquaglia C, Diaco M, Nucera G, La Regina M, Montalto M, Manna R |title=Pharmacological and clinical basis of treatment of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) with colchicine or analogues: an update |journal=Current drug targets: inflammation and allergy |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=117–24 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15720245 |doi= 10.2174/1568010053622984|url=http://www.bentham-direct.org/pages/content.php?CDTIA/2005/00000004/00000001/0019L.SGM[/tpl]  It had previously been approved as an ingredient in an FDA-approved combination product for gout. The approval was based on a study in which two doses an hour apart were effective at combating the condition.
It is also used as an anti-inflammatory agent for long-term treatment of Behçet's disease.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Cocco|first1=Giuseppe|last2=Chu|first2=David C.C.|last3=Pandolfi|first3=Stefano|title=Colchicine in clinical medicine.

===Use in cancer treatment===

Since one of the defining characteristics of cancer cells is a significantly increased rate of mitosis ,[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] this means that cancer cells are significantly more vulnerable to colchicine poisoning than are normal cells. However, the therapeutic value of colchicine against cancer is (as is typical with chemotherapy agents) limited by its toxicity against normal cells.

===Contraindications===

Long-term (prophylactic) regimens of oral colchicine are absolutely contraindicated in patients with advanced renal failure (including those on dialysis). Ten to 20% of a colchicine dose is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Colchicine is not removed by hemodialysis.  Cumulative toxicity is a high probability in this clinical setting.  A severe neuromyopathy may result. The presentation includes a progressive onset of proximal weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and sensorimotor polyneuropathy.  Colchicine toxicity can be potentiated by the concomitant use of cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins, fibrates). This neuromuscular condition can be irreversible (even after drug discontinuation). Accompanying dementia has been noted in advanced cases.  It may culminate in hypercapnic respiratory failure and death. (Minniti-2005)

===Adverse effects===

Side-effects include gastrointestinal upset and neutropenia. High doses can also damage bone marrow and lead to anemia and also cause hair loss. All of these side-effects can result from hyperinhibition of mitosis.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]
A main side-effect associated with all mitotic inhibitors is peripheral neuropathy, which is a numbness or tingling in the hands and feet due to peripheral nerve damage that can become so severe that reduction in dosage or complete cessation of the drug may be required. Microtubules are involved in vesicular transport. Peripheral nerves are among the longest in the body. Brownian motion is not significant enough in these peripheral nerves to allow vesicles to reach their destination. Thus, they are susceptible to microtubule toxins.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]

===Toxicity===

Colchicine poisoning has been compared to arsenic poisoning. Symptoms start 2 to 5 hours after the toxic dose has been ingested and include burning in the mouth and throat, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and kidney failure. These symptoms may set in as many as 24 hours after exposure. Onset of multiple-system organ failure may occur within 24 to 72 hours. This includes hypovolemic shock due to extreme vascular damage and fluid loss through the GI tract, which may cause death. In addition, sufferers may experience kidney damage that causes low urine output and bloody urine, low white blood cell counts (persisting for several days), anemia; muscular weakness, and respiratory failure. Recovery may begin within six to eight days.
There is no specific antidote for colchicine, though various treatments exist.Colchicine. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Emergency Response Safety and Health Database, August 22, 2008. Retrieved December 23, 2008. Certain common inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp, including grapefruit juice, may increase the risk of colchicine toxicity.

===Biosynthesis===

Several experiments show that the biosynthesis of colchicine involves the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine as precursors. Indeed, the feeding of Colchicum autumnale with radioactive amino acid, tyrosine-2-C14, caused the latter to partially incorporate in the ring system of colchicine. The induced absorption of radioactive phenylalanine-2-C14 by Colchicum byzantinum, another plant of the Colchicaceae family, resulted in its efficient absorption by colchicine.Leete, E. The biosynthesis of the alkaloids of Colchicum: The incorporation of phenylalaline-2-C14 into colchicine and demecolcine. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963, 85, 3666-3669. However, it was proven that the tropolone ring of colchicine resulted, in essence, from the expansion of the tyrosine ring. 
Further radioactive feeding experiments of Colchicum autumnale revealed that Colchicine can be synthesized biosynthetically from (S)-Autumnaline. That biosynthesic pathway occurs primarily through a para-para phenolic coupling reaction involving the intermediate isoandrocymbine. The resulting molecule undergoes O-methylation directed by S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM). Two oxidation steps followed by the cleavage of the cyclopropane ring leads to the formation of the tropolone ring contained by N-formyldemecolcine. N-formyldemecolcine hydrolyzes then to generate the molecule demecolcine, which also goes through an oxidative demethylation that generates deacetylcolchicine. The molecule of colchicine appears finally after addition of acetyl-Coenzyme A to deacetylcolchicine.Dewick, P. M.(2009).Medicinal Natural Products: A biosynthetic Approach. Wiley. p.360-362.Maier, U. H.; Meinhart, H. Z. Colchicine is formed by para para phenol-coupling from autumnaline. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997, 38, 7357-7360.

===Botanical use===

Since chromosome segregation is driven by microtubules, colchicine is also used for inducing polyploidy in plant cells during cellular division by inhibiting chromosome segregation during meiosis; half the resulting gametes, therefore, contain no chromosomes, while the other half contain double the usual number of chromosomes (i.e., diploid instead of haploid, as gametes usually are), and lead to embryos with double the usual number of chromosomes (i.e., tetraploid instead of diploid). While this would be fatal in most higher animal cells, in plant cells it is not only usually well tolerated but in fact frequently results in plants that are larger, hardier, faster-growing, and in general more desirable than the normally diploid parents; for this reason, this type of genetic manipulation is frequently used in breeding plants commercially.
When such a tetraploid plant is crossed with a diploid plant, the triploid offspring will usually be sterile (unable to produce fertile seeds or spores), although many triploids can be propagated vegetatively.  Growers of annual triploid plants not readily propagated must buy fresh seed from a supplier each year.  Many sterile triploid plants, including some tree and shrubs, are becoming increasingly valued in horticulture and landscaping because they do not become invasive species.  In certain species, colchicine-induced triploidy has been used to create "seedless" fruit, such as seedless watermelons (Citrullus lanatus).  Since most triploids do not produce pollen themselves, such plants usually require cross-pollination with a diploid parent to induce fruit production.
Colchicine's ability to induce polyploidy can be also exploited to render infertile hybrids fertile, for example in breeding triticale (× Triticosecale) from wheat (Triticum spp.) and rye (Secale cereale).  Wheat is typically tetraploid and rye diploid, with their triploid hybrid infertile;  treatment of triploid triticale with colchicine gives fertile hexaploid triticale.
When used to induce polyploidy in plants, colchicine cream is usually applied to a growth point of the plant, such as an apical tip, shoot, or sucker.  Also, seeds can be presoaked in a colchicine solution before planting.  Another way to induce polyploidy is to chop off the tops of plants and carefully examine the regenerating lateral shoots and suckers to see if any look different.Deppe, Carol (1993). Breed Your own Vegetable Varieties.  Little, Brown & Company. p.150-151. ISBN 0-316-18104-8  If no visual difference is evident, flow cytometry can be used for analysis.
Doubling of plant chromosome numbers also occurs spontaneously in nature, with many familiar plants being fertile polyploids.  Natural hybridization between fertile parental plants of different levels of polyploidy can produce new plants at an intermediate level, such as a triploid produced by crossing between a diploid and a tetraploid, or a hexaploid produced by crossing between a diploid and an octoploid.

==Marketing exclusivity in the United States==

As a drug predating the FDA, colchicine was sold in the United States for many years without having been reviewed by the FDA for safety and efficacy. In 2009, the FDA reviewed an NDA submitted by URL Pharma and approved colchicine for gout flares, awarding Colcrys a three-year term of market exclusivity, prohibiting generic sales, and increasing the price of the drug from $0.09 to $4.85 per tablet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fdalawblog.net/fda_law_blog_hyman_phelps/2009/10/california-court-denies-preliminary-injunction-in-lanham-act-case-concerning-unapproved-colchicine-d.html|title=California Court Denies Preliminary Injunction in Lanham Act Case Concerning Unapproved Colchicine Drugs|author=Kurt R.

Numerous consensus guidelines, and previous randomized controlled trials, had concluded that colchicine is effective for acute flares of gouty arthritis. However, as of 2006, the drug was not formally approved by the FDA, owing to the lack of a conclusive randomized control trial (RCT).  That year, the FDA started an Unapproved Drugs Initiative, through which they sought more rigorous testing of efficacy and safety of colchicine and other unapproved drugs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/SelectedEnforcementActionsonUnapprovedDrugs/ucm118990.htm |title=FDA Unapproved Drugs Initiative [/tpl] In exchange for paying for the costly testing, the FDA gave URL Pharma three years of market exclusivity for its Colcrys brand,[tpl]cite web|title=About Colcrys|url=http://www.colcrys.com/about-colcrys.htm|work=Colcrys|publisher=URL Pharma|accessdate=11 September 2011[/tpl] under the Hatch-Waxman Act, based in part on URL-funded research in 2007, including pharmacokinetic studies and a randomized control trial with 185 patients with acute gout. URL Pharma also received seven years of market exclusivity for Colcrys in treatment of familial Mediterranean fever, under the Orphan Drug Law. URL Pharma then raised the price per tablet from $0.09 to $4.85 and sued to remove other versions from the market, increasing annual costs for the drug to U.S. state Medicaid programs from $1 million to $50 million. Medicare also paid
significantly higher costs—making this a direct money-loser for the government. (In a similar case, thalidomide was approved in 1998 as an orphan drug for leprosy and in 2006 for multiple myeloma.)[tpl]cite journal |author=Kesselheim AS, Solomon DH |title=Incentives for drug development--the curious case of colchicine |journal=N.

In April 2010, in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), A.S. Kesselheim and D.H. Solomon said that the rewards of this legislation are not calibrated to the quality or value of the information produced, that there is no evidence of meaningful improvement to public health, that it would be much less expensive for the FDA, the National Institutes of Health or large insurers like medicare and medicaid or coalitions of private insurers to pay for trials themselves.  Furthermore, the cost burden of this subsidy falls primarily on patients or their insurers. URL Pharma posted a detailed rebuttal of the NEJM editorial.Response from URL Pharma
In September 2010, the FDA ordered a halt to marketing unapproved single-ingredient oral colchicine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm227796.htm |title=FDA orders halt to marketing of unapproved single-ingredient oral colchicine |date=30 Sep 2010 [/tpl]
