Columbia University in the City of New York, commonly referred to as Columbia University, is an American private Ivy League research university located in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan in New York City. It is the oldest institution of higher learning in the State of New York, the fifth oldest in the United States, and one of the country's nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution.[tpl]cite web|url= http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/shaping_the_world/index.html |title= The Course of History |publisher=Columbia University |year=2004 |accessdate=November 22, 2004[/tpl] Today the university operates Columbia Global Centers overseas in Amman, Beijing, Istanbul, Paris, Mumbai,  Rio de Janeiro, Santiago and Nairobi.[tpl]cite web | url=http://globalcenters.columbia.edu/content/columbia-global-centers | title= Columbia University Global Centers | publisher=Columbia University | accessdate=May 4, 2011[/tpl]
The university was founded in 1754 as King's College by royal charter of George II of Great Britain. After the American Revolutionary War, King's College briefly became a state entity, and was renamed Columbia College in 1784. The University now operates under a 1787 charter that places the institution under a private board of trustees, and in 1896 it was further renamed Columbia University.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/history.html | title=A Brief History of Columbia | publisher=Columbia University | year=2011 | accessdate= April 14, 2011[/tpl] That same year, the university's campus was moved from Madison Avenue to its current location in Morningside Heights, where it occupies more than six city blocks, or [tpl]convert|32|acres|ha|abbr=on[/tpl].Columbia University Office of Undergraduate Admissions - Housing & Dining The university encompasses twenty schools and is affiliated with numerous institutions, including Teachers College (which is an academic department of the university though legally separate from the university), Barnard College, and the Union Theological Seminary, with joint undergraduate programs available through the Jewish Theological Seminary of America as well as the Juilliard School.Columbia College Academics > Special Programs > Juilliard

==History==

===King's College (1754–1784)===

Discussions regarding the founding of a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704, when Colonel Lewis Morris wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the missionary arm of the Church of England, persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college;[tpl]cite book |title=Stand, Columbia : A History of Columbia University in the City of New York |last=McCaughey |first=Robert |year= 2003|publisher=Columbia University Press |location= New York, New York |isbn=0231130082 |page=1 |accessdate=April 11, 2011[/tpl] however, not until the founding of Princeton University across the Hudson River in New Jersey did the City of New York seriously consider founding a college. In 1746 an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the Church of England, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.[tpl]cite book |title= Columbia |last=Keppel |first= Fredrick Paul |year= 1914 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= Oxford, England |page=26 |accessdate=April 14, 2011[/tpl]
Classes were initially held in July 1754 and were presided over by the college's first president, Dr. Samuel Johnson.[tpl]cite book |title= A History of Columbia University: 1754-1904 |last= Matthews |first=Brander | coauthors= John Pine, Harry Peck, Munroe Smith |year= 1904 |publisher=Macmillan Company |location= London, England |pages= 8–10 |accessdate= April 14, 2011[/tpl] Dr. Johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class, which consisted of a mere eight students. Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church, located on what is now lower Broadway in Manhattan.[tpl]cite book |title= An Official Guide to Columbia University |last=Butler |first= Nicholas Murray |year= 1912 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location= New York, New York |page= 3|accessdate=April 12, 2011[/tpl] The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of King George II, making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States.
In 1763, Dr. Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by Myles Cooper, a graduate of The Queen's College, Oxford, and an ardent Tory. In the charged political climate of the American Revolution, his chief opponent in discussions at the College was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, Alexander Hamilton.[tpl]Harvnb|Butler|1912|p=3[/tpl] The American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of King's College, which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the Continental Army. The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.[tpl]cite book|last=Schecter |first=Barnet |title=The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution |publisher=Walker & Company |year=2002 |isbn=9780802713742 [/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=McCullough |first=David | authorlink=David McCullough |title=1776 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2005 |isbn=9780743226714 [/tpl] Loyalists were forced to abandon their King's College in New York, which was seized by the rebels and renamed Columbia University. The Loyalists, led by Bishop Charles Inglis fled to Windsor, Nova Scotia, where they founded what is now the University of King's College.

===Columbia College (1784–1896)===

After the Revolution, the college turned to the State of New York in order to restore its vitality, promising to make whatever changes to the schools charter the state might demand.[tpl]Harvnb|Matthews|1904|p=59[/tpl] The Legislature agreed to assist the college, and on May 1, 1784, it passed "an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College."[tpl]Cite book| last2= | first2= | author2-link= | title= A History of Columbia University, 1754–1904 | year=1904 | location=New York | publisher=Macmillan | id = | isbn= 1402137370 [/tpl] The Act created a Board of Regents to oversee the resuscitation of King's College, and, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the Legislature stipulated that "the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of Columbia College," a reference to Columbia, an alternative name for America. The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by John Jay and Alexander Hamilton. In April of that same year, a new charter was adopted for the college, still in use today, granting power to a private board of 24 Trustees.[tpl]Harvnb|Moore|1846|pp=65–70[/tpl]
On May 21, 1787, William Samuel Johnson, the son of Dr. Samuel Johnson, was unanimously elected President of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the university, Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.[tpl]cite book |title= William Samuel Johnson: A Maker of the Constitution |last= Groce |first= C. G. | year=1937 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location= New York, New York |accessdate= April 16, 2011[/tpl] For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. Both President George Washington and Vice President John Adams attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school that had been involved in the American Revolution.[tpl]Harvnb|Matthews|1904|p=74[/tpl]
The college's enrollment, structure, and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century, with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the College functioned. In 1857, the College moved from Park Place to a primarily Gothic Revival campus on 49th Street and Madison Avenue, where it remained for the next fifty years. During the last half of the 19th century, under the leadership of President F.A.P. Barnard, the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university.[tpl]cite web| last = McCaughey | first = Robert | date = December 10, 2003 | url = http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/stand_columbia/phdleaders1861-1900.html | title = Leading American University Producers of PhDs, 1861–1900 | work=Stand, Columbia - A History of Columbia University|publisher=Columbia University Press|accessdate = August 10, 2006[/tpl] By this time, the College's investments in New York real estate became a primary source of steady income for the school, mainly owing to the city's rapidly expanding population.[tpl]Harvnb| Butler|1912|pp=5–8[/tpl]

===Columbia University (1896–present)===

In 1896, the trustees officially authorized the use of yet another new name, Columbia University, and today the institution is officially known as "Columbia University in the City of New York." At the same time, university president Seth Low moved the campus again, from 49th Street to its present location, a more spacious campus in the developing neighborhood of Morningside Heights."Columbia University's Lunatic Past." Ephemeral New York website. May 5, 2008 Under the leadership of Low's successor, Nicholas Murray Butler, who served for over four decades, Columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for research, setting the "multiversity" model that later universities would adopt.

During the 1960s Columbia experienced large-scale student activism, which reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied various buildings on campus.

==Campus==

===Morningside Heights===

The majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught in one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts principles by architects McKim, Mead, and White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or [tpl]convert|32|acres|abbr=on[/tpl], in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive underground tunnel system more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.[tpl]cite web | last = Duncan | first = Steve | date = March 31, 2006 | url = http://www.undercity.org/photos/CriticalSpaceEquip/index.htm | title=Finding History In Radioactive Storage Rooms | work=Undercity.org | accessdate = April 16, 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Duncan | first = Steve | date = July 20, 2005 | url = http://www.undercity.org/photos/1Gallery/CU_hoppersfront2.htm | title= Old Coal Hoppers, Columbia University | work=Undercity.org | accessdate = April 16, 2011 [/tpl]
The Nicholas Murray Butler Library, commonly known simply as Butler Library, is the largest single library in the Columbia University Library System, and is one of the largest buildings on the campus. Proposed as "South Hall" by the university's former President Nicholas Murray Butler as expansion plans for Low Memorial Library stalled, the new library was funded by Edward Harkness, benefactor of Yale's residential college system, and designed by his favorite architect, James Gamble Rogers. It was completed in 1934 and renamed for Butler in 1946. The library's design is neo-classical in style. Its facade features an arcade of columns in the Ionic order above which are inscribed the names of great writers, philosophers, and thinkers, most of whom are read by students engaged in the Core Curriculum of Columbia College.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/img/assets/5295/SelfGuided.pdf | title= Butler Library: Self-Guided Tour | publisher=Columbia University | accessdate= April 11, 2011 [/tpl] As of 2012, Columbia's library system includes over 11.9  million volumes, making it the eighth largest library system and fifth largest collegiate library system in the United States.[tpl]cite web | url=http://library.columbia.edu/about/facts.html | publisher=Columbia University | title= Libraries and Collections: Fast Facts | accessdate=April 11, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ala.org/ala/professionalresources/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet22.cfm | publisher=American Library Association | title= The Nation's Largest Libraries: A Listing By Volumes Held | accessdate=April 11, 2013[/tpl]
Several buildings on the Morningside Heights campus are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Low Memorial Library, a National Historic Landmark and the centerpiece of the campus, is listed for its architectural significance. Philosophy Hall is listed as the site of the invention of FM radio. Also listed is Pupin Hall, another National Historic Landmark, which houses the physics and astronomy departments. Here the first experiments on the fission of uranium were conducted by Enrico Fermi. The uranium atom was split there ten days after the world's first atom-splitting in Copenhagen, Denmark.[tpl]cite web |url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/87002599.pdf |author=Carolyn Pitts |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Low Memorial Library, Columbia |year=1987 |publisher=National Park Service[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Photos/66000550.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Pupin Physics Laboratories, Columbia University--Accompanying photos |year=1983 |publisher=National Park Service[/tpl]Robert D.

A statue by sculptor Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater is centered on the front steps of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired.[tpl]cite web |url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!20526~!0#focus |title= Alma Mater (sculpture) |author=Smithsonian American Art Museum's Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture |publisher=The Smithsonian Institute |accessdate=April 14, 2011[/tpl] The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.[tpl]cite web |url=http://eye.columbiaspectator.com/article/2011/02/10/myth-college-sweetheart |title=The Myth of the College Sweetheart |author=Meredith Foster |date= February 11, 2011 |work=The Eye |publisher=Columbia Spectator |accessdate=April 14, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/newrec/2423/tmpl/story.4.html | title= What Is the Mace?

"The Steps", alternatively known as "Low Steps" or the "Urban Beach", are a popular meeting area for Columbia students. The term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus (South Field) to its upper terrace. With a design inspired by the City Beautiful movement, the steps of Low Library provides Columbia University and Barnard College students, faculty, and staff with a comfortable and spacious outdoor platform and space for informal gatherings, events, and ceremonies. McKim's classical facade epitomizes late 19th century new-classical designs, with its columns and portico marking the entrance to an important structure.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dlmplanners.org/notes/pdf/The%20Steps%20at%20Low%20Library.pdf | publisher=Dober, Lidsky, Craig and Associates, Inc. | title=The Steps at Low Library | author=Richard P.

===Other campuses===

In April 2007, the university purchased more than two-thirds of a [tpl]convert|17|acre[/tpl] site for a new campus in Manhattanville, an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus. Stretching from 125th Street to 133rd Street, the new campus will house buildings for Columbia's Business School, School of International and Public Affairs, and the Jerome L. Greene Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.[tpl]cite web| url = http://neighbors.columbia.edu/pages/manplanning/index.html | title = Manhattanville in West Harlem | accessdate = April 1, 2007[/tpl] The $7 billion expansion plan includes demolishing all buildings, except three that are historically significant, eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses, and relocating tenants in 132 apartments.

===Sustainability===

In 2006, the university established the Office of Environmental Stewardship to initiate, coordinate and implement programs to reduce the university's environmental footprint. The U.S. Green Building Council selected the university's Manhattanville plan for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Neighborhood Design pilot program. The plan commits to incorporating smart growth, new urbanism and "green" building design principles.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.neighbors.columbia.edu/pages/manplanning/proposed_plan/environmental.html | title= Manhattanville in West Harlem | publisher=Columbia University | accessdate= April 11, 2011[/tpl] Columbia is one of the 2030 Challenge Partners, a group of nine universities in the city of New York that have pledged to reduce their greenhouse emissions by 30% within the next ten years. Columbia University adopts LEED standards for all new construction and major renovations. The University requires a minimum of Silver, but through its design and review process seeks to achieve higher levels. This is especially challenging for lab and research buildings with their intensive energy use; however, the university also uses lab design guidelines that seek to maximize energy efficiency while protecting the safety of researchers.[tpl]cite web | url=http://environment.columbia.edu/greenbuildings | publisher=Columbia Environmental Stewardship | title=Projects: Green Buildings | accessdate = April 11, 2011[/tpl]

On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400m to $600m donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education. Its exact value will depend on the eventual value of Kluge's estate at the time of his death; however, the generous donation has helped change financial aid policy at Columbia.Wall Street Journal article breaking the news about Kluge's donation Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. As of 2008, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/education/11columbia.html | work=The New York Times | title=Columbia University to Offer Financial Aid to More Students | date=March 11, 2008 | accessdate=March 28, 2010[/tpl] In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and Columbia Engineering, formerly known as SEAS, began accepting the Common Application.

Scholarships are also given to undergraduate students by the admissions committee. Designations include John W. Kluge Scholars, John Jay Scholars, C. Prescott Davis Scholars, Global Scholars, Egleston Scholars, and Science Research Fellows. Named scholars are selected by the admission committee from first-year applicants. According to Columbia, the first four designated scholars "distinguish themselves for their remarkable academic and personal achievements, dynamism, intellectual curiosity, the originality and independence of their thinking, and the diversity that stems from their different cultures and their varied educational experiences."Named Scholars

===Organization===

Columbia University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is "The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York." The university's first Charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern Charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 Trustees, customarily including the President, who serves ex officio. The Trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the Board in consultation with the Executive Committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the President, are nominated by the Trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for Trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The Trustees appoint the President and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/vpaa/handbook/organization.html | title= Organization and Governance of the University | year= 2011 | publisher=Columbia University Press | accessdate= April 16, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/board-trustees.html | title= Board of Trustees | publisher=Columbia University | accessdate= April 17, 2011[/tpl]
The University Senate was established by the Trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the Provost, the Deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all who serve ex officio, and five additional representatives, appointed by the President, from the university's administration. The President serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university. It oversees the welfare and academic freedom of the faculty and the welfare of students.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/senate/ | title= Columbia University Senate | publisher=Columbia University | accessdate= April 17, 2011[/tpl]
The President of Columbia University, who is selected by the Trustees in consultation with the Executive Committee of the University Senate and who serves at the Trustees' pleasure, is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the President in administering the University are the Provost, the Senior Executive Vice President, the Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences, several other vice presidents, the General Counsel, the Secretary of the University, and the deans of the Faculties, all of whom are appointed by the Trustees on the nomination of the President and serve at their pleasure. Lee C. Bollinger became the 19th President of Columbia University on June 1, 2002. A prominent advocate of affirmative action, he played a leading role in the twin Supreme Court cases—Grutter v Bollinger and Gratz v Bollinger—that upheld and clarified the importance of diversity as a compelling justification for affirmative action in higher education. A leading First Amendment scholar, he is widely published on freedom of speech and press, and currently[tpl]when|date=April 2012[/tpl] serves on the faculty of Columbia Law School.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.columbia.edu/cu/president/docs/bio/index.html| title= Office of the President: Lee Bollinger | accessdate= April 14, 2011[/tpl]

For the 2010 academic year, Columbia University's student population was 27,606, with 35% of the student population identifying themselves as a minority and 23% born outside of the United States. Columbia enrolled 7,934 students in undergraduate programs, 5,393 students in graduate programs, and 12,090 students in professional programs. 26% of students at Columbia have family incomes below $60,000, making it one of the most socioeconomically diverse top-tier colleges. 16% of students at Columbia receive Federal Pell Grants, which mostly go to students whose family incomes are below $40,000. 15% of students are the first member of their family to attend a four-year college.
On-campus housing is guaranteed for all four years as an undergraduate. Columbia College and Columbia Engineering, formerly known as SEAS, share housing in the on-campus residence halls. First-year students usually live in one of the large residence halls situated around South Lawn: Hartley Hall, Wallach Hall (originally Livingston Hall), John Jay Hall, Furnald Hall or Carman Hall. Upperclassmen participate in a room selection process, wherein students can pick to live in a mix of either corridor- or apartment-style housing with their friends. The Columbia University School of General Studies and graduate schools have their own apartment-style housing in the surrounding neighborhood.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/admissions/university/campus/housing.php | title= Housing and Dining | publisher=Columbia University Office of Student Affairs | accessdate=April 16, 2011[/tpl]

Columbia is home to two early pioneers in undergraduate campus radio broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with Major Edwin Armstrong. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the very first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/wkcr/history | title="The Original FM": The Columbia University Radio Club | publisher=Columbia University | year= 2009 | accessdate=January 12, 2013[/tpl] The station has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan.

==Student activism==

===Protests of 1968===

Students initiated a major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues. The first was Columbia's proposed gymnasium in neighboring Morningside Park; this was seen by the protesters to be an act of aggression aimed at the black residents of neighboring Harlem. A second issue was the Columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in the Pentagon's weapons research think-tank, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). Students barricaded themselves inside Low Library, Hamilton Hall, and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students."Columbia's Radicals of 1968 Hold a Bittersweet Reunion". ''The New York Times. April 28, 2008.Columbia University - 1968
The protests achieved two of their stated goals. Columbia disaffiliated from the IDA and scrapped the plans for the controversial gym, building a subterranean physical fitness center under the north end of campus instead. The gym's plans were eventually used by Princeton University for the expansion of its athletic facilities. At least 30 Columbia students were suspended by the administration as a result of the protests. Many of the Class of '68 walked out of their graduation and held a countercommencement on Low Plaza with a picnic following at Morningside Park, the place where the protests began.[tpl]cite book | url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/sites/cct/files/cct_spring_1968.pdf | title=Columbia College Today | author=George Keller | publisher=Columbia University | accessdate= April 11, 2011[/tpl] The protests hurt Columbia financially as many potential students chose to attend other universities and some alumni refused to donate money to the school. Allan Bloom, a professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago,
believed that the protest efforts at Columbia were responsible for pushing higher education further toward the liberal left. As a result of the protests, Bloom stated, "American universities were no longer places of intellectual and academic debate, but rather places of 'political correctness' and liberalism."[tpl]cite book |title= Harlem vs. Columbia University: Black Student Power in the Late 1960s|last= Bradley|first= Stefan|year= 2009|publisher=University of Illinois|location= New York, New York|isbn= 9780252034527 |pages=5–19, 164–191, 174 | accessdate=April 18, 2011[/tpl] [tpl]when|date=January 2013[/tpl]

===Protests against racism and apartheid===

Further student protests, including hunger strike and more barricades of Hamilton Hall and the Business School"Disinvestment from South Africa #University campuses" during the late 1970s and early 1980s, were aimed at convincing the university trustees to divest all of the university's investments in companies that were seen as active or tacit supporters of the apartheid regime in South Africa. A notable upsurge in the protests occurred in 1978, when following a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the student uprising in 1968, students marched and rallied in protest of university investments in South Africa. The Committee Against Investment in South Africa (CAISA) and numerous student groups including the Socialist Action Committee, the Black Student Organization and the Gay Students group joined together and succeeded in pressing for the first partial divestment of a U.S. university.

===Ahmadinejad speech controversy===

The School of International and Public Affairs traditionally extends invitations to many heads of state and heads of government who come to New York City for the opening of the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly. In 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was one of those invited to speak on campus. Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September 24, 2007, as part of Columbia University's World Leaders Forum. The invitation proved to be highly controversial. Hundreds of demonstrators swarmed the campus on September 24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide. University President Lee C. Bollinger tried to assuage the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak, but with a negative introduction (given personally by Bollinger). This did not mollify those who were displeased with the fact that the Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/24/politics/main3292477.shtml |title=Candidates Speak Out On Ahmadinejad Visit |date=September 24, 2007 |publisher=CBS News[/tpl] Columbia students, though, turned out en masse to listen to the speech on the South Lawn. An estimated 2,500 undergraduates and graduates came out for the historic occasion.
During his speech, Ahmadinejad criticized Israel's policies towards the Palestinians; called for research on the historical accuracy of the Holocaust; raised questions as to who initiated the 9/11 attacks; defended Iran's nuclear power program, criticizing the UN's policy of sanctions on his country; and attacked U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. In response to a question about Iran's treatment of women and homosexuals, he asserted that women are respected in Iran and that "In Iran, we don't have homosexuals like in your country... In Iran, we do not have this phenomenon.

Bollinger, stated that he did not favor reinstating Columbia's ROTC program, because of the military's anti-gay policies. In November 2008, Columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum on the question of whether or not to invite ROTC back to campus, and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue. ROTC lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration, and did not include graduate students, faculty, or alumni) by a fraction of a percentage point. In April 2010 during Admiral Mike Mullen's address at Columbia, President Lee C. Bollinger stated that the ROTC would be readmitted to campus if the admiral's plans for revoking the don't ask, don't tell policy were successful. In February 2011 during one of three town-hall meetings on the ROTC ban, former Army staff sergeant Anthony Maschek, a purple heart recipient for injuries sustained during his service in Iraq, was booed and hissed at by some students during his speech promoting the idea of allowing the ROTC on campus.Karni, Annie, "http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/hero_unwelcome_Zi3u1fwtRpo87vXAiAQfSN", New York Post, February 20, 2011.

==Traditions==

===Orgo Night===

On the day before the Organic Chemistry exam—which is often on the first day of finals—at precisely the stroke of midnight, the Columbia University Marching Band occupies Butler Library to distract diligent students from studying. After a forty-five minutes or so of jokes and music, the procession then moves out to the lawn in front of Hartley, Wallach and John Jay residence halls to entertain the residents there. The Band then plays at various other locations around Morningside Heights, including the residential quadrangle of Barnard College, where students of the all-women's school, in mock-consternation, rain trash – including notes and course packets – and water balloons upon them from their dormitories above. The Band tends to close their Orgo Night performances before Furnald Hall, known among students as the more studious and reportedly "anti-social" residence hall, where the underclassmen in the Band serenade the graduating seniors with an entertaining, though vulgar, mock-hymn to Columbia, composed of quips that poke fun at the various stereotypes about the Columbia student body.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cumb.org/orgo-night-a-columbia-university-marching-band-tradition/ | publisher=Columbia University Marching Band Legacy | title= Orgo Night!

===Tree-Lighting and Yule Log ceremonies===

The campus Tree-Lighting Ceremony is a relatively new tradition at Columbia, inaugurated in 1998. It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of Kent and Hamilton Halls on the east end and Dodge and Journalism Halls on the west, just before finals week in early December. The lights remain on until February 28. Students meet at the sun-dial for free hot chocolate, performances by various a cappella groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html | title= Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony | author=Jason Hollander | publisher=Columbia University News | accessdate=April 15, 2011[/tpl]
Immediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the American Revolutionary War, but lapsed before being revived by University President Nicholas Murray Butler in the early 20th century. A troop of students dressed as Continental Army soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony is accompanied by a reading of A Visit From St. Nicholas by Clement Clarke Moore and Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus by Francis Pharcellus Church.[tpl]cite web| last = Hollander|first = Jason|date = December 3, 1999 | url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html | title = Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony | work=Columbia News | accessdate = August 10, 2006[/tpl]
