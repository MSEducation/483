==Early life==

Born in Antioch, California, Waldie attended Antioch public schools. After three years in the Army during World War II, he graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1950 with a degree in political science, and earned a law degree from the university's Boalt Hall School of Law in 1953. He served in the United States Army from 1943 to 1946.

==Political career==

Waldie served as a Democratic member of the California State Assembly from 1959 to 1966, becoming Majority Leader in 1961. One of his last  accomplishments in Sacramento was to carry the constitutional amendment pushed by Speaker of the Assembly Jesse Unruh to create a full-time Legislature.
Waldie was then elected to the Eighty-ninth Congress, by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of United States Representative John F. Baldwin. He was reelected four times, serving from June 7, 1966 to January 3, 1975. 
As Congressman, he was an early critic of U.S. involvement in Vietnam and an advocate of health care reforms.
During the Watergate scandal, Waldie was a vocal critic of President Richard Nixon. Three days after Nixon fired Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox (in what became known as the "Saturday Night Massacre") Waldie introduced a resolution calling for the impeachment of the President, one of the first members of the House Judiciary Committee to do so. He later voted to impeach Nixon in July 1974.
Waldie did not run for reelection to the Congress that year. Instead, he campaigned for the Democratic nomination for Governor of California in the June Primary election, but was defeated by then-Secretary of State Jerry Brown, who went on to win in November.

==Post-Congressional life==

As an ex-Congressman, Waldie served as a public advocate. He was chairman of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission from 1978 to 1979 and the executive director of the White House Conference on Aging (1980). He also served as member of the California Agricultural Relations Board from 1981 to 1985. He eventually retired to Placerville, California where he resided until his death in April 2009.
