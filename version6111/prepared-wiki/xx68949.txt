Hogan enjoyed mainstream popularity in the 1980s and 90s as the all-American character Hulk Hogan in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), and as "Hollywood" Hulk Hogan, the villainous nWo leader, in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). A regular pay-per-view headliner in both organizations, Hogan closed the respective premier annual events of the WWF and WCW, WrestleMania and Starrcade, on multiple occasions. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005. He was signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) from 2010 until 2013, where he was the on-screen General Manager.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tnawrestling.com/content/view/1770/84/|title=Hulk Hogan Joins TNA Wrestling!|date=October 27, 2009|accessdate=2009-10-27|publisher=Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091029133223/http://www.tnawrestling.com/content/view/1770/84/|archivedate=October 29, 2009[/tpl] With a professional career spanning five decades, Hogan is widely considered one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/02/top-50-wrestlers-of-all-time?page=5 |title=Top 50 Wrestlers of All Time |publisher=ign.com |accessdate=2014-04-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/723945-ranking-the-25-greatest-wrestlers-of-all-time/page/25 |title=Ranking the 25 Greatest Wrestlers of All Time |publisher=bleacherreport.com |accessdate=2014-04-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thetoptens.com/wwe-wrestlers/ |title=Greatest WWE Wrestlers of All Time |publisher=thetoptens.com |accessdate=2014-04-10[/tpl]
Hulk Hogan is a 12-time world champion being a six-time WWF/E Champion and six-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion. He is the third longest combined reigning WWF Champion of all time (after Bruno Sammartino, and Bob Backlund), the longest-reigning champion of the 1980s, and holds two of the ten longest title runs in WWF/E history, having held the title for 1,474 days from 1984-1988 (the fourth longest reign of all time) and 364 days from 1989 to 1990 (the 9th longest reign of all time). He is also the longest-reigning WCW World Heavyweight Champion of all time, with a 469-day reign from 1994-1995. Hogan won the Royal Rumble in 1990 and 1991, making him the first man to win two consecutive Royal Rumbles.

==Early life==

Hogan was born Terry Eugene Bollea in Augusta, Georgia in 1953,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/h/hulk-hogan.html|title=Hulk Hogan's Profile|accessdate=2007-12-10|publisher=Online World of Wrestling[/tpl] the son of Ruth V.

When he was one and a half years old, his family moved to Port Tampa, Florida.Hulk Hogan (2009). My Life Outside the Ring. St. Martin's Press. p. 11. ISBN 9780312588892.
As a boy, he was a pitcher in Little League Baseball. He began watching professional wrestling at 16 years old. While in high school, he revered Dusty Rhodes, and he regularly attended cards at the Tampa Sportatorium. It was at one of those wrestling cards where he first turned his attention towards "Superstar" Billy Graham and looked to him for inspiration;[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=45|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl] since he first saw Graham on TV, Hogan wanted to match his "inhuman" look. Hogan was also a skilled musician, spending ten years playing electric bass guitar in several Florida-based rock bands.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200552|title=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture|author=Patrick Jones|accessdate=2007-10-25|year=2002[/tpl]
He went on to study at Hillsborough Community College and the University of South Florida. After music gigs began to get in the way of his time in college, Hogan decided to drop out of the University of South Florida before receiving any degree.[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=41|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl] Eventually, Hogan and two local musicians formed a band called Ruckus in 1976.[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=44|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl] The band soon became a local sensation in the Tampa Bay region.
During his spare time, Hogan worked out at Hector's Gym in the Tampa Bay area and eventually became strong enough to do big lifting.[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=42|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl] Many of the wrestlers who were competing in the Florida region visited the bars where Ruckus was performing. Among those attending his performances were Jack and Gerald Brisco, two brothers who wrestled together as a tag team in the Florida region. Impressed by Hogan's physical stature, the Brisco brothers asked Hiro Matsuda—the man who trained wrestlers working for Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF)—to make him a potential trainee.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/geraldbrisco|title=Gerald Brisco|accessdate=June 4, 2012|publisher=WWE[/tpl] In 1976, the two brothers asked Hogan to try wrestling. Having been a wrestling fan since childhood, Hogan eventually agreed.[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=47|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl] At first, however, Mike Graham, the son of CWF promoter Eddie Graham, refused to put Hogan in the ring;[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=51|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl] according to Hogan, he met Graham while in high school and the two didn't get along. However, after Hogan quit Ruckus and started telling people in town that he was going to be a wrestler, Mike Graham finally agreed to accept the Brisco Brothers' request.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early years (1977–1979)===

In the mid-1977, after training for more than a year with Matsuda,[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=56|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl] the Brisco brothers dropped by Matsuda's gym to see Hogan. During this visit, Jack Brisco handed Hogan a pair of wrestling boots and informed him that he was scheduled to wrestle his first match the following week. In his professional wrestling debut, Eddie Graham booked him against Brian Blair in Fort Myers, Florida on August 10, 1977, in Championship Wrestling from Florida.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oldschool-wrestling.com/geeklog/article.php/20061017223545426|title=Old School Wrestling – Florida results 1977 (August 10)[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=57|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl] A short time later, Bollea donned a mask and assumed the persona of "The Super Destroyer," a hooded character first played by Don Jardine and subsequently used by other wrestlers. Hogan, however, eventually could no longer work with Hiro Matsuda,[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=61|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl] whom he felt was an overbearing trainer, and left Championship Wrestling From Florida.[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=62|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl] After declining an offer to wrestle for the Kansas City circuit, Hogan took a hiatus from wrestling and managed a private club in Cocoa Beach, Florida-known as the Anchor Club-. for a man named Whitey Bridges. Eventually, Whitey and Hogan became close friends, and decided to open a gym together; the gym became known as Whitey and Terry's Olympic gym. Soon after, Hogan's friend Ed Leslie (later known as Brutus Beefcake) came down to Cocoa Beach to help Hogan and Bridges manage both the Anchor Club and the Whitey and Terry's Olympic Gym. On his spare time, he and Leslie worked out in the gym together, and eventually, Beefcake developed a muscular physique;[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=67|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl] Hogan was impressed by Beefcake's physical stature and became convinced that the two of them should wrestle together as tag team partners. Depressed and yearning to return to wrestling, Hogan called Superstar Billy Graham in 1978 with hopes that Graham could find him a job wrestling outside of Florida; Graham agreed and Hogan soon joined Louie Tillet's Alabama territory. Hogan also convinced Leslie, who had yet to become a wrestler, to come with him and promised to teach him everything he knew about the sport.
In Alabama, he and Leslie wrestled as Terry and Ed Boulder, known as the Boulder Brothers.[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=73|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl] These early matches as a tag team with the surname Boulder being used by both men prompted a rumor among wrestling fans unaware of the inner workings of the sport that Hogan and Leslie were brothers, as few people actually knew their real names outside of immediate friends, family, and of course the various promoters the two worked for. After wrestling a show for Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) in Memphis,[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=75|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl] Jerry Jarrett, the promoter for the (CWA), approached Hogan and Leslie and offered them a job in his promotion for $800.00 a week; this was far more than the $175.00 a week they would make working for Tillet. Hogan and Leslie accepted this offer and left Tillet's territory.
During his time in Memphis, Hogan appeared on a local talk show, where he sat beside Lou Ferrigno, star of the television series The Incredible Hulk.[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=76|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl]  The host commented on how Terry, who stood 6 ft 7 in (201 cm) and weighed 295 pounds with 24 inch biceps, actually dwarfed "The Hulk."  Watching the show backstage, Mary Jarrett noticed that Hogan was actually bigger than Ferrigno, who was well known at the time for having large muscles.[tpl]cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=77|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892[/tpl]  As a result, Bollea began performing as Terry "The Hulk" Boulder and sometimes wrestled as Sterling Golden.
In May 1979, Bollea had an early shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, which at the time was generally recognized as the highest honor in wrestling. On December 1, 1979, Bollea won his first wrestling championship, the NWA Southeastern Heavyweight Championship (Northern Division), recognized in Alabama and Tennessee, when he defeated Bob Roop in Knoxville, TN. Bollea would drop the belt in January 1980 to Bob Armstrong. Bollea briefly wrestled in the Georgia Championship Wrestling territory from September thru December 1979 as Sterling Golden.

===World Wrestling Federation (1979–1980)===

Later that year, former NWA World Champion Terry Funk introduced Bollea to the company head Vincent J. McMahon, who was impressed with his charisma and physical stature. McMahon, who wanted to use an Irish name, gave Bollea the last name Hogan, and also wanted him to dye his hair red. Hogan who said his hair was already beginning to fall out, refused to dye it and simply said, "I'll be a blond Irish."Fifteen Greatest Superstars of the '80s DVD Hogan wrestled his first match in the WWF on November 17 defeating Harry Valdez on WWF Championship Wrestling. He made his first appearance at Madison Square Garden, defeating Ted DiBiase after a bearhug. McMahon gave Hogan former tag team champion Tony Altomare as chaperone and guide.[tpl]cite book|title=Often Imitated, Never Duplicated: Captain Lou Albano|last=Albano|first=Lou|pages=104|publisher=GEAN Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-0-615-18998-7[/tpl] At this time, Hogan wrestled Bob Backlund for the World Championship,[tpl]cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1980|work=Angelfire|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/80.htm|accessdate=2007-02-27|year=1980 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061222064125/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/80.htm  |archivedate = December 22, 2006[/tpl] and he started his first big feud with André the Giant, which culminated in a match with André at Shea Stadium in August 1980.[tpl]cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1980|work=Angelfire|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/80.htm|accessdate=2008-02-27|date=August 9, 1980 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080220173429/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/80.htm  |archivedate = February 20, 2008[/tpl] Hulk Hogan claims in his autobiography that he and André the Giant were the reason for the Shea gate. However, Bruno Sammartino/Larry Zbyszko sold out everywhere they wrestled leading up the show. Hogan and Andre wrestled in White Plains, New York, drawing 1,200 in a building that held 3,500 as the main event before they wrestled at Shea. During his initial heel run in the WWF, Hogan was paired with "Classy" Freddie Blassie, a wrestler-turned-manager.

===New Japan Pro Wrestling (1980–1983, 1984–1985)===

A great deal of Hogan's early success was achieved in New Japan Pro Wrestling. Japanese wrestling fans were in awe of the gargantuan blond American and nicknamed him "Ichiban" (which translates to "Number One"). Hogan first appeared in Japan on May 13, 1980, while he was still with the WWF. He occasionally toured the country over the next few years, facing a wide variety of opponents ranging from Tatsumi Fujinami to Abdullah the Butcher. When competing in Japan, Hogan used a vastly different repertoire of wrestling moves, relying on more technical, traditional wrestling holds and maneuvers as opposed to the power-based, brawling style American fans became accustomed to seeing from him. Another difference is that Hogan used the Axe Bomber, a crooked arm lariat, as his finisher in Japan instead of the running leg drop that has been his standard finisher in America. Hogan still made appearances for the WWF, even unsuccessfully challenging Pedro Morales for the Intercontinental Championship on March 26, 1981.[tpl]cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=El Diario Culebrense|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=2012-10-24|page=39[/tpl] On June 2, 1983, Hogan became the first International Wrestling Grand Prix (IWGP) tournament winner (although he held the IWGP Heavyweight Championship belt, this was not the beginning of the actual championship), defeating Japanese wrestling icon Antonio Inoki by knockout in the finals of a 10-man tournament featuring top talent from throughout the world. Hogan and Inoki also worked as partners in Japan, winning the prestigious MSG Tag League tournament two years in a row: in 1982 and 1983. Hogan's popularity in Japan was so great, he even recorded an album there—a forerunner to the World Wrestling Federation's "Rock 'n' Wrestling" of the mid-1980s.
In 1984, Hogan returned to New Japan, to wrestle Antonio Inoki in the finals of the IWGP League, in which he lost the belt by countout, thanks to interference from Riki Chōshū. Hogan also defended his WWF World title against various stars in New Japan including Inoki, Seiji Sakaguchi, and Tatsumi Fujinami among others, until the WWF ended their relationship with New Japan in October 1985.

===American Wrestling Association (1981–1983)===

After filming his scene for Rocky III against the elder McMahon's wishes, Hogan made his debut in the American Wrestling Association, owned by Verne Gagne. Hogan started his AWA run as a heel, taking on "Luscious" Johnny Valiant as his manager. This didn't last for long as the AWA fans fell in love with Hogan's presence and Hogan became the top face of the AWA, battling the Heenan Family and  Nick Bockwinkel for the AWA championship to many "Dusty Finishes" teasing the fans for an obviously deserved and fan demanded title run as the peoples champion. But behind the scenes Gagne placed demands on Bollea before handing the AWA title over to him. Hogan, unwilling to give up his life as a bachelor and marry Gagne's daughter for the world title of the AWA, continued to turn down the belt. Hulk's AWA popularity and HULKAMANIA pushed him to the top of the USA wrestling scene, and even, the worldwide scene of wrestling, and Hogan was an obvious star. Soon, attempts to woo Hogan into giving Gagne more of a share of his profits and booking in Japan along with attempts to bring him into the Gagne family pushed Hogan to leave the AWA and Hogan accepted an offer to return to the Northeast by Vincent K. McMahon Jr., who had just recently purchased the WWF from his ailing father.

===Return to World Wrestling Federation (1983-1993)===

====The Crowning of Hulkamania (1983–1984)====

After purchasing the company from his father in 1982, Vincent K. McMahon had plans to expand the territory into a nationwide promotion, and he handpicked Hulk Hogan to be the company's showpiece attraction due to his charisma and name recognition. Hogan made his return at a television taping in St. Louis, Missouri on December 27, 1983 defeating Bill Dixon.[tpl]cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1983|work=Angelfire|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/83.htm|accessdate=2008-02-27|date=December 27, 1983 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071203141804/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/83.htm  |archivedate = December 3, 2007[/tpl]
On the January 7, 1984 edition of Championship Wrestling, Hogan confirmed his face status for the WWF fans by saving Bob Backlund from a three-way assault.[tpl]cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1984|work=Angelfire|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/84.htm|accessdate=2008-02-27|date=January 7, 1984 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071204183532/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/84.htm  |archivedate = December 4, 2007[/tpl] Hogan's turn was explained simply by Backlund: "He's changed his ways. He's a great man. He's told me he's not gonna have Blassie around." The storyline shortcut was necessary because less than three weeks later on January 23, Hogan won his first WWF Championship, pinning The Iron Sheik (who had Blassie in his corner) in Madison Square Garden.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454120|title=Hulk Hogan's first WWE Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-12[/tpl] The storyline accompanying the victory was that Hogan was a "last minute" replacement for the Sheik's original opponent Bob Backlund,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/Hulkhogan/|title=Hulk Hogan's Bio|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2011-03-29[/tpl] and became the champion by way of being the first man to escape the camel clutch (the Iron Sheik's finishing move).[tpl]cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1984|work=Angelfire|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/84.htm|accessdate=2008-02-27|date=January 23, 1984 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071204183532/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/84.htm  |archivedate = December 4, 2007[/tpl] The backstage story was that the WWF Champion Bob Backlund had refused to let Hogan win the title from him, demanding that any wrestler to whom he lost the belt have a legitimate wrestling background.  As a consequence, The Iron Sheik won the title from Backlund first and then dropped it to Hogan.
Immediately after the title win, commentator Gorilla Monsoon proclaimed "Hulkamania is here!" Hogan frequently referred to his fans as "Hulkamaniacs" in his interviews and introduced his three "demandments": training, saying prayers, and eating vitamins. Eventually, a fourth demandment (believing in oneself) was added during his feud with Earthquake in 1990. Hogan's ring gear developed a characteristic yellow-and-red color scheme; his ring entrances involved him ritualistically ripping his shirt off his body, flexing, and listening for audience cheers in an exaggerated manner. The majority of Hogan's matches during this time involved him wrestling heels who had been booked as unstoppable monsters, using a format which became near-routine: Hogan would deliver steady offense, but eventually lose momentum, seemingly nearing defeat. He would then experience a sudden second wind, fighting back while "feeding" off the energy of the audience, becoming impervious to attack—a process described as "Hulking up". His signature maneuvers—pointing at the opponent (which would later be accompanied by a loud "YOU!" from the audience), shaking his finger to scold him, three punches, an Irish Whip, the big boot and running leg drop—would follow and ensure him a victory. That finishing sequence would occasionally change depending on the storyline and opponent; for instance, with "Giant" wrestlers, the sequence might involve a body slam.
Over the next year, Hulk Hogan became the face of pro wrestling as McMahon pushed the WWF into a pop culture enterprise with The Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection on MTV, drawing record houses, pay-per-view buyrates, and television ratings in the process. The centerpiece attraction for the first WrestleMania on March 31, 1985, Hogan teamed with legit friend, TV and movie star Mr. T, to defeat his archrival "Rowdy"Roddy Piper and "Mr Wonderful" Paul Orndorff.[tpl]cite web|title="Mr. Wonderful" Paul Orndorff & "Rowdy" Roddy Piper w/ Cowboy Bob Orton vs. Hulk Hogan & Mr. T w/ "Superfly" Jimmy Snuka|publisher=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm1/mainevent1/|accessdate=2008-02-27|date=March 31, 1985[/tpl] On the first edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, Hogan successfully defended the WWF title against Cowboy Bob Orton in a match which Hogan won by a disqualification (Orton had been in the corner of Piper and Orndorff at Wrestlemania and had accidentally caused his team's defeat by knocking out Orndorff after he jumped from the top turnbuckle and hit him in the back of the head with his arm cast in a shot meant for Hogan).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/snme/history/1985to1992/may111985|title=Saturday Night's Main Event I results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-12|date=May 11, 1985[/tpl]
Hogan was named the most requested celebrity of the 1980s for the Make-a-Wish Foundation children's charity. He was featured on the covers of Sports Illustrated (the first and as of 2013, only professional wrestler to do so), TV Guide, and People magazines, while also appearing on The Tonight Show and having his own CBS Saturday morning cartoon titled Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling. Hogan, as the premier WWF icon, headlined eight of the first nine WrestleMania events. He also co-hosted Saturday Night Live on March 30, 1985 during this lucrative run. AT&T reported that his 900 number information line was the single biggest 900 number from 1991 to 1993. Hogan operated the 900 number through his stint in WWF and then recreated it when he joined World Championship Wrestling.

====WWF Champion (1984–1988)====

On the October 5, 1985 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, he successfully defended the title against Nikolai Volkoff in a flag match.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/snme/history/1985to1992/oct051985|title=Saturday Night's Main Event II results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-12|date=October 5, 1985[/tpl] He met long-time rival Roddy Piper in a WWF title match at the Wrestling Classic pay-per-view (PPV) event.

In the fall of 1986, Hogan occasionally wrestled in tag matches with The Machines as Hulk Machine under a mask copied from New Japan Pro Wrestling gimmick "Super Strong Machine."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/machines.html|title=The Machines Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-12[/tpl] At WrestleMania III in 1987, Hogan was booked to defend the title against André the Giant, who had been the sport's premier star and was pushed as undefeated for the previous two decades. A new storyline was introduced in early 1987; Hogan was presented a trophy for being the WWF Champion for three consecutive years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/listthis/ruggedroadstomania/roadstomania1|title=The Big One|last=McAvennie|first=Mike|date=March 30, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-19|publisher=WWE[/tpl] André the Giant, a good friend came out to congratulate him.[tpl]cite book|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|last=Shields|first=Brian|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2006|isbn=1-4165-3257-9|page=38[/tpl] Shortly afterward, André was presented a slightly smaller trophy for being "undefeated in the WWF for 15 years." Hogan came out to congratulate André, who walked out in the midst of Hogan's speech. Then, on an edition of Piper's Pit, Hogan was confronted by Bobby Heenan, who announced that André was his new protégé, and Andre challenged Hogan to a title match at WrestleMania III.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_4_4/ai_94123536|title=The main events: ladies and gentlemen, may we present the 25 most memorable matches in the last 25 years|last=Eck|first=Kevin|publisher=Wrestling Digest|accessdate=2007-10-14|date=December 2002 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071015121440/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_4_4/ai_94123536  |archivedate = October 15, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html|title=Steamboat – Savage rule WrestleMania 3|last=Powell|first=John|publisher=SLAM!

====The Mega Powers (1988–1989)====

Hogan remained WWF Champion for four years (1,474 days).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/thist/world.html|title=WWE World Heavyweight Championship History|work=Complete WWE|accessdate=2008-04-12[/tpl] In front of 33 million viewers, however, Hogan finally lost the belt to André on the February 5 edition of The Main Event after a convoluted scam involving "The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase and Earl Hebner (who assumed the place of his twin brother Dave Hebner, the match's appointed referee). After André delivered a belly to belly suplex on Hogan, Hebner counted the pin while Hogan's left shoulder was clearly off the mat. After the match, André handed the title over to DiBiase to complete their business deal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/snme/880205.html|title=The Main Event results – February 5, 1988|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-12[/tpl] As a result, the WWF Championship was vacated for the first time in its 25-year history because WWF President Jack Tunney decreed the championship could not be sold from one wrestler to another. At WrestleMania IV, Hogan participated in a tournament for the vacant WWF title to regain it; he and André were given a bye into quarter-finals but their match resulted in a double disqualification.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm4/results/|title=WrestleMania IV official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-12|date=March 27, 1988[/tpl] Later that night in the main event, Hogan came to ringside to stop André interfering which helped "Macho Man" Randy Savage defeat Ted DiBiase to win the title.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm4/mainevent/|title=Randy "Macho Man" Savage vs. "Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase – WWE Championship Tournament Finals|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-12|date=March 27, 1988[/tpl]
Together, Hogan, Savage, and manager Miss Elizabeth formed a partnership known as The Mega Powers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/megapowers.html|title=Mega Powers Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=June 4, 2012[/tpl] After Savage became WWF Champion at WrestleMania IV, they feuded with The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant) and defeated them at the main event of the first SummerSlam.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1988/mainevent1/|title=Hulk Hogan & "Macho Man" Randy Savage w/ Elizabeth vs. "Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase & André the Giant w/ Virgil and Bobby "The Brain" Heenan|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-12|date=August 29, 1988 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080724013841/http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1988/mainevent1/ |archivedate = July 24, 2008[/tpl] They then went on to feud with Slick's Twin Towers: Akeem and Big Boss Man.
In mid-1988, Hogan wrestled at house shows in singles competition with his "War Bonnet", a red and yellow gladiator helmet with a fist-shaped crest. This was notably used to give Bad News Brown his first WWF loss at a Madison Square Garden house show before it was discarded altogether.[tpl]cite web |url=http://droptoehold.com/post/4287696459/wwf-fist |title=The Rarely Seen Hulk Hogan Fist Helmet - Boston, MA 9/10/88 |publisher=Drop Toehold |date=2011-04-02 |accessdate=2013-03-22[/tpl] The War Bonnet gimmick was revisited in the WWE's online comedy series Are You Serious? in 2012.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pwmania.com/john-cena-debuting-attire-tonight-hulk-hogans-fist-helmet-ays-mick-foley |title=John Cena Debuting New Attire Tonight, Hulk Hogan’s Fist Helmet On "AYS?", Mick Foley |publisher=PWMania |date=2012-11-18 |accessdate=2013-03-22[/tpl]
The Mega Powers began to implode due to Savage's burgeoning jealousy of Hogan and his paranoid suspicions that Hogan and Elizabeth were more than friends. At the Royal Rumble in 1989, Hogan eliminated Savage from the Royal Rumble match while eliminating Bad News Brown, which caused tension, only to be eliminated by the Twin Towers himself.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/hogan.html|title=Hulk Hogan's Bio|work=Accelerator's Wrestling Rollercoaster|accessdate=2008-04-13[/tpl] The duo broke up while wrestling The Twin Towers on the February 3, 1989 edition of The Main Event. During the match, Savage accidentally collided with Miss Elizabeth. Hogan took her backstage to receive medical attention, temporarily abandoning Savage. When he returned to the ring, Savage slapped Hogan and left the ring, where Hogan eventually won the match by himself.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/snme/890203.html|title=The Main Event results – February 3, 1989|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-13[/tpl] After the match, Savage attacked Hogan backstage, which started a feud between the two. Their feud culminated in Hogan beating Savage for his second WWF Championship at WrestleMania V.

====WWF Championship reigns (1989–1992)====

Hogan's second run lasted a year, during which time he starred in the movie No Holds Barred. The film was the inspiration of a feud with Hogan's co-star Tom Lister, Jr., who appeared at wrestling events as his movie character, Zeus. Zeus was a monster heel who was "jealous" over Hogan's higher billing and wanted revenge. Hogan, however, was easily able to defeat Zeus in a series of matches across the country during late 1989, beginning with a tag team match at SummerSlam, in which Hogan and Brutus Beefcake topped Zeus and Savage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1989/mainevent/|title=Hulk Hogan & Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake w/ Elizabeth vs. "Macho Man" Randy Savage & Zeus w/ Sensational Sherri|publisher=WWE|date=2008-04-13|date=August 28, 1989[/tpl] Hogan and Beefcake defeated Zeus and Savage in a rematch at the No Holds Barred pay-per-view to end the feud. Hogan also had defeated Savage to retain his WWF Championship in their WrestleMania rematch on October 10, 1989 at United Kingdom-only pay-per-view First WWF UK Event at London Arena.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/h/Hulkbrutus.html|title=Mega-Maniacs Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/miscppvs1980s.html#nhb|title=No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie results|publisher=Wrestling and Tournaments|accessdate=2008-04-13|date=December 27, 1989[/tpl]
During his second run, Hogan won the 1990 Royal Rumble match. He dropped the title to Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior in a title versus title match at WrestleMania VI on April 1, 1990.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm6/mainevent/|title=Ultimate Warrior vs. Hulk Hogan – Intercontinental and WWE Championship Match|publisher=|accessdate=2008-04-13|date=April 1, 1990[/tpl]
Hogan soon became embroiled in a heated feud with the 470-pound Earthquake, who had crushed Hogan's ribs in a sneak attack on The Brother Love Show in May 1990. On television, announcers explained that Hogan's injuries and his WrestleMania VI loss to Warrior both took such a huge toll on his fighting spirit that he wanted to retire. Viewers were asked to write letters to Hogan and send postcards asking for his return (they got a postcard-sized picture in return, autographed by Hogan, as a "thank-you"). Hogan returned by SummerSlam 1990 and for several months, dominated Earthquake in a series of matches across the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1990/mainevent/|title=Hulk Hogan w/ Big Bossman vs. Earthquake w/ Jimmy Hart and Dino Bravo|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-13|date=August 27, 1990[/tpl] His defeat of this overwhelmingly large foe caused Hogan to add a fourth demandment: believing in yourself. He also became known as "The Immortal" Hulk Hogan. Hogan then became the first wrestler to win two Royal Rumble matches in a row, as he won the 1991 Royal Rumble match.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/1988116/mainevent/|title=Hulk Hogan (spot No. 24) wins the Royal Rumble Match|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-04-13|date=January 19, 1991[/tpl]
At WrestleMania VII, Hogan stood up for the USA against Sgt. Slaughter, defeating him for his third WWF Championship, and then defeating him again in the rematch at United Kingdom-only pay-per-vew UK Rampage at London Arena.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm7/mainevent/|title=Hollywood Hogan vs. Sgt.
