Donato Barcaglia (Pavia, December 1, 1849 â€“ Rome, 1930) was an Italian sculptor.

==Biography==

He attended the courses of sculpture taught by Abbondio Sangiorgio at the Brera Academy in Milan. His first work at 17 years of age, was Il Vendemmiatore.  Barcaglia established himself as a portraitist in the 1860s before devoting his energies in the following decade to genre sculpture, for which he achieved distinction at the international exhibitions held in Vienna in 1873 and Philadelphia in 1876. This later gave way to a more rigorous classical style both in public works and in the groups sculpted in the first two decades of the new century for tombs in the Cimitero Monumentale in Milan.
Among his works are:Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti., by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 35-36.
