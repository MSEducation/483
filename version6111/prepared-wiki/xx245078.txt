[[Asian Games sports]]

CATEGORIES: Asian Games

This is a list of sports played in the Asian Games and other major affiliated games organised by the Olympic Council of Asia. On 29 June 2009, the OCA announced major changes to the event lists in the five major events, in particular aiming to restrict each sport to be played in not more than one event, although exemptions may be made.http://www.ocasia.org/News/IndexNewsRM.aspx?redirect=395 The first round of changes commenced with the 2014 Asian Games when the number of events was recommended to be restricted to 35 with 28 Olympic sports and up to a maximum of seven non-Olympic sports. Some events currently in the Asian Games programme may henceforth be relegated to the newly formed Asian Indoor-Martial Arts Games which was first held in 2013 and/or to the Asian Beach Games.
