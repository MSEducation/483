==Biography==

His father, J. B. Sullivan, moved the family to Douglas, to open a law practice. Mike Sullivan graduated from Douglas High School as the class salutatorian. He continued his education at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, where he earned a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering and then a law degree.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_wyoming/col2-content/main-content-list/title_sullivan_michael.html| title= Wyoming Governor Michael J.

On September 2, 1961, Sullivan married Jane Metzler of Riverton in ceremonies in Powell. They made their home in Casper.
Sullivan practiced law with the firm of Brown, Drew, Apostolos, Massey, and Sullivan for twenty years. Sullivan had never sought elective office when, in 1986, he ran for and won the Democratic nomination for governor.  Many observers believed that, following three terms with a Democratic governor (Ed Herschler) the chances for another Democrat to gain that post would be remote.  Nonetheless, after a hard-fought campaign, Sullivan defeated Republican nominee Peter K. Simpson. In his 1990 reelection, Sullivan defeated the rancher and businesswoman Mary Mead of Jackson, daughter of Republican former Governor and U.S. Senator Clifford P. Hansen. Sullivan received 104,638 votes (65.4 percent) to her 55,471 ballots (34.6 percent). In the general election,  Mead polled only 4,311 more votes than she had in her closed primary. Hence, she was unable to reach beyond her base of support within the GOP.
Sullivan tapped the journalist Dennis E. Curran, a native of Wisconsin, to serve from 1987 to 1994 as his press secretary, after which time Curran launched the Wyoming Business Report.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dailyranger.com/story.php?story_id=1114|title=Fremont County: The Ranger Digest, April 11, 2012|publisher=dailyranger.com|accessdate=May 19, 2012[/tpl]He named a Republican, Joseph B.

Sullivan ran for the U.S. Senate in 1994, but lost 59-39 percent to then-Representative Craig L. Thomas, largely a part of the national Republican wave of 1994.
Four years after his governorship ended, Sullivan was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Ireland by President Clinton, a post he held from 1999 to 2001.Wyoming State Archives official gubernatorial biography
