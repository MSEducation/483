Carol Ivory, chair of the Department of Fine Arts at Washington State University, has described Lianga's work as follows:
 Lianga looks both backwards and forwards, bringing mythology, history and the contemporary world together in riveting works of art. ... Lianga's artwork often engages with significant issues arising from post-colonial situations, creating works that can be described as both visually appealing and emotionally powerful. 
Lianga was a guest speaker at the university in 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~ivorycs/FA404/FA404.html |title=FA 404 (M): Advanced Art History, Non-Western Art â€“ Art and Artists of the Pacific: Themes and Issues |accessdate=2008-05-24 |date=2007-03-07 |publisher=Washington State University[/tpl]
