[tpl]legend|#4ee257|Undetermined: 99.173[/tpl]]]As of 2008, the largest ethnic groups in Estonia are Estonians (68.7%), Russians (25.6%), Ukrainians (2.1%), Belarusians (1.2%), and Finns (0.8%).  These five groups made up 98.4% of Estonia's population.

==Languages==

Many languages are spoken in Estonia, including Estonian (official), Russian, Ukrainian, English, Finnish, German and others. According to the census of 2000, 109 languages were spoken natively in Estonia. By 2011, the number of languages spoken natively had increased to 157, mainly due to new immigrants. However, most of these languages were used only between relatives or compatriots, while only 30 languages were spoken on a daily basis in families.Mart Rannut. "Keeleaasta 2012." Sirp, 1-25-2013.

Estonian and Finnish are closely related, belonging to the same Finnic branch of the Uralic language family. Nevertheless, the two languages are not mutually intelligible, although educated native speakers can read the other language with a greater or lesser degree of understanding. Estonian and Finnish are only distantly related to the Hungarian language.
Written with the Latin alphabet, Estonian is the language of the Estonian people and the official language of the country. One-third of the standard vocabulary is derived from adding suffixes to root words. The oldest known examples of written Estonian originate in 13th century chronicles. During the Soviet era, the Russian language was imposed in parallel to, and often instead of, Estonian in official use.

==Religion==

According to the most recent Eurobarometer Poll 2010,Biotechnology report 2010 p.383 18% of Estonian citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", whereas 50% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 29% that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force". This, according to the survey, would have made Estonians the most non-religious people in the then 25-member European Union. A survey conducted in 2006–2008 by Gallup showed that 14% of Estonians answered positively to the question: "Is religion an important part of your daily life?", which was the lowest among 143 countries polled.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/114211/Alabamians-Iranians-Common.aspx|title=What Alabamians and Iranians Have in Common|date=February 9, 2009|publisher=Gallup|first1=Steve|last1=Crabtree|first2=Brett|last2=Pelham|accessdate=21 February 2010[/tpl]
Less than a third of the population define themselves as believers; of those, the majority are Lutheran, whereas the Russian minority is Eastern Orthodox. Ancient equinoctial traditions (like St John's Day) are held in high regard. In 2000, according to the census, 29.2% of the population considered themselves to be related to any religion, thereof:[tpl]cite web | url=http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/I_Databas/Population_census/16Religious_affiliation/16Religious_affiliation.asp | title=Statistical database: Population Census 2000 – Religious affiliation | accessdate=2011-02-18 | date=22 October 2002 | publisher=Statistics Estonia[/tpl]
There are also a number of smaller Protestant, Jewish, and Buddhist groups. The organisation Maavalla Koda (Taaraism) unites adherents of animist traditional religions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.maavald.ee/eng/uudised.html?rubriik=50&id=363&op=lugu|title=Old estonian religions|accessdate=3 January 2013|publisher=Maavalla Koda|author=Ahto Kaasik[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/world/europe/09iht-estonia.4.18535971.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ellen | last=Barry | date=2008-11-09 | title=Some Estonians return to pre-Christian animist traditions[/tpl] The Russian neopagan organisation "Vene Rahvausu Kogudus Eestis" is registered in Tartu.Uut usuühendust juhib ülemvaimulikuna Vene Erakonna Eestis poliitik
