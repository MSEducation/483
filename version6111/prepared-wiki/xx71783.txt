Brian Lee Harvey (born 8 August 1974) is an English musician and lead singer of pop band East 17.
Harvey was born in Walthamstow, London, and attended Sir George Monoux School from 1988â€“90.

==Career==

Harvey was initially slated to be a backup singer and dancer for East 17, but during the initial recording session he was heard singing along by the recording staff and was promptly instated as the lead singer of the band.
Harvey's vocal style emulated R&B and new jack swing vocalists from the United States His vocals put him into a position of the band's frontman, or main member, which was shared with the band's creator, songwriter, instrumentalist, rapper and singer Tony Mortimer.
Throughout the course of the band's career the two leads had many disagreements, from how to vocalise songs to their behaviour in public. This tore the band between spiritual pop/hip-hop (Mortimer's writing influence) and R&B (the other band members) which would eventually lead to Mortimer leaving the band and Harvey becoming the only lead singer.
Harvey was sacked from the band after making comments in a radio interview that appeared to condone the use of the drug ecstasy. Mortimer left East 17 several months later. He eventually rejoined the band under the rebranded name of E-17.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4598937.stm|title=Life of troubled pop star Harvey|publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=1 June 2005 | accessdate=31 December 2009[/tpl]
