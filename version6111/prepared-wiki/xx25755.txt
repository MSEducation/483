Soviet submarine ''K-162 was the world's fastest submarine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deepstorm.ru/DeepStorm.files/45-92/nsrs/661/k-162/k-162.htm |title=К-18, К-162, К-222 Проект 661 |publisher=Deepstorm.ru |date=2005-01-25 |accessdate=2011-02-24 |language=Russian[/tpl] The first submarine constructed with a titanium hull, she was the only vessel of the Soviet Union's 'Project 661 Anchar nuclear-powered attack submarine design. The boat is best known in the West by its NATO reporting name Papa class. ''K-162'' was renamed K-222''' in 1978.

==Design==

This project was intentionally forced to be highly innovative, as it was forbidden to reuse the past technical solutions. While enforcing innovation, this also slowed the development. Project 661 began in 1959, with design task assigned to OKB-16, one of the two predecessors (the other being SKB-143) of the famous Malachite Central Design Bureau, which would eventually become one of the three Soviet/Russian submarine design centers, along with Rubin Design Bureau and Lazurit Central Design Bureau ("Lazurit" is the Russian word for lazurite).
K-222 was designed as an extremely fast attack submarine, and was the first submarine built with a titanium hull. She was armed with 10 SS-N-7 Starbright (П-70 «Аметист») missiles in individual tubes forward of the sail, between the inner and outer hulls, which were both of titanium alloy. Similar in design to the [tpl]sclass-|Charlie|submarine[/tpl], K-222 was designed to intercept and attack aircraft carrier groups. Like the Charlie class and the later [tpl]sclass-|Oscar|submarine[/tpl], her cruise missiles could only be reloaded in port, making her one of the Soviet Navy's "one shot" boats.
K-222 had two water-water reactors, designed to be as compact as possible. Unusually, there were no diesel generators, using the  powerful battery as the emergency power source.
She is regarded as a predecessor to the [tpl]sclass-|Alfa|submarine[/tpl] and [tpl]sclass-|Sierra|submarine[/tpl]s, and may have tested technologies which were later used in those classes.

==History==

K-222 was laid down on December 28, 1963 and commissioned on December 31, 1969, at Severodvinsk. She was assigned to the Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet for the duration of her career. She was the world's fastest submarine, reaching a record submerged speed of [tpl]convert|44.7|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on|lk=in[/tpl] on trials. Her unofficial maximum speed, reached 30 March 1971, is [tpl]convert|44.85|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. However, K-222[tpl]'[/tpl]s high speed came at the price of high costs during construction, and both excessive noise and significant damage to external hull features when used.
Though officially named, within the Soviet Navy the boat was commonly referred to as the "Golden Fish", in reference to her cost of development and construction.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.russiandefenseblog.org/?p=944 |title=Papa class submarine K-222 scrapped |work=Russia & CIS Defense Policy Blog|publisher=Russiandefenseblog.org |date=2010-03-04 |accessdate=2011-02-24[/tpl]
On September 30, 1980, one of K-222[tpl]'[/tpl]s  nuclear reactors was damaged during maintenance in the shipyard. By 1988, she was placed in reserve at the Belomorsk Naval Base in Severodvinsk.  Beginning on 5 March 2010 [tpl]cite web|author=05.03.2010 |url=http://rusnavy.com/news/navy/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=8840 |title=Zvezdochka dismantles unique titanium nuc sub |publisher=Rusnavy.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-24[/tpl] the boat was dismantled at Sevmash, the only facility capable of handling the titanium hull. In an unusual move, the scrapping was performed with the reactors and nuclear fuel still on board, as no provisions had been made in the design for the reactor's removal. The scrapping also began before the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) chose an international consultant for the fuel's unloading.

==K-222 in Popular Culture==

The sole Papa-class submarine is briefly featured as participating in Soviet anti-convoy operations in the Atlantic in Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy, causing both surprise and frustration to the escorts' commanders.Tom Clancy, Red Storm Rising, 1989
