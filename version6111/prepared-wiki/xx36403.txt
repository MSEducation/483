==History==

Stewiacke was named in the language of the local Mi'kmaq, First Nations people, and is a word meaning "flowing out in small streams" and "winding river" or "whimpering or whining as it goes".[tpl]cite web|url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mnh/nature/nhns2/500/511.htm|title=Museum, Government of Nova Scotia - 511 Windsor Lowlands|accessdate=2009-04-19|publisher=Museum.gov.ns.ca[/tpl] During the French and Indian War, the British built Fort Ellis is the area to protect New England Planters from Mi'kmaq raids.
In the late 1990s, a tourism attraction named Mastodon Ridge opened near the town's highway exit, based on a local discovery of a Mastodon skeleton. The Mastodon Ridge Complex features a craft store, toy store, a mini golf and interpretive centre which displays several of the mastodon's bones.
Stewiacke is home to two bars, a pharmacy, a grocery store, a convenience store, a hardware store, an audio-visual production company, an 18-hole golf course and a newly built elementary school that consolidates 3 former local schools.
Stewiacke is also home to a volunteer fire brigade that was the first department in North America to use specialized foam as a fire suppression agent. Alongside other achievements involving the implementation of certain fire apparatus.
The town is noted as being located halfway between the North Pole and the Equator (Actually in Alton, Nova Scotia).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.burnsidenews.com/index.cfm?sid=106007&sc=397|title=The Burnside News - Burnside entrepreneur to develop Stewiacke industrial park|accessdate=2009-04-19|publisher=BurnsideNews.com[/tpl]  Controversy in the past over this claim stems from the fact that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, and therefore the halfway mark lies approximately 16Â km North of the 45th parallel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/2000JRASC..94...48B/0000048.000.html|title=Midway from the Equator to the North Pole - Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada|accessdate=2009-04-19|publisher=Harvard.edu[/tpl]
