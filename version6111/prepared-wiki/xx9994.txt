Rolling Stone is a magazine published every two weeks that focuses on politics and popular culture. In 1967, Rolling Stone was founded in San Francisco, California, by Jann Wenner – who is still the magazine's chief editor – and music critic, Ralph J. Gleason.
Rolling Stone was known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by the enigmatic and controversial gonzo journalist, Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine changed its format to appeal to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. This led to criticism that the magazine was emphasizing style over substance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.samuelfreedman.com/articles/culture/ust_rolling.html|title=Literary 'Rolling Stone' sells out to male titillation|last=Freedman|first=Samuel G. |date=Date TK, 2002|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=February 12, 2009[/tpl]
In recent years, the magazine has resumed its traditional mix of content, including in-depth political stories. It also has expanded content to include coverage of financial and banking issues. As a result, the magazine has seen its circulation increase and its reporters invited as experts to network television programs of note.Bill Moyers, Matt Taibbi and Yves Smith on the Follies of Big Banks and Government, June 22, 2012

==Beginnings==

To get the magazine off the ground, Wenner borrowed $7,500 from his family
members and from the family of his soon-to-be wife, Michell Palmer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/04/20/wenner/print.html|title=The evolution of Jann Wenner: How the ultimate '60s rock groupie built his fantasy into a media empire|last=Weir|first=David|coauthors=Salon people.com|date=April 20, 1999|work=Wenner's world|publisher=People |accessdate=February 12, 2009[/tpl] The first issue carried a cover date of November 9, 1967 and was in newspaper format with a lead article on the Monterey Pop Festival.[tpl]cite web|last=French|first=Alex|title=The Very First Issues of 19 Famous Magazines|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/50299/very-first-issues-19-famous-magazines|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=August 12, 2013[/tpl] Rolling Stone magazine, named after the Muddy Waters song "Rollin' Stone" (1950),[tpl]Cite book  | last = Palmer  | first = Robert  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Deep Blues  | publisher = Penguin Books  | year = 1981  | location =   | page = 104  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 0-14-006223-8[/tpl] was initially identified with and reported on the hippie counterculture of the era. However, the magazine distanced itself from the underground newspapers of the time, such as Berkeley Barb, embracing more traditional journalistic standards and avoiding the radical politics of the underground press. In the very first edition of the magazine, Wenner wrote that Rolling Stone "is not just about the music, but about the things and attitudes that music embraces."
In the 1970s, Rolling Stone began to make a mark for its political coverage, with the likes of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson writing for the magazine's political section. Thompson would first publish his most famous work Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas within the pages of Rolling Stone, where he remained a contributing editor until his death in 2005. In the 1970s, the magazine also helped launch the careers of many prominent authors, including Cameron Crowe, Lester Bangs, Joe Klein, Joe Eszterhas, Patti Smith and P. J. O'Rourke. It was at this point that the magazine ran some of its most famous stories, including that of the Patty Hearst abduction odyssey. One interviewer, speaking for large numbers of his peers, said that he bought his first copy of the magazine upon initial arrival on his college campus, which he described as a "rite of passage".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.samuelfreedman.com/articles/culture/ust_rolling.html|title=Literary 'Rolling Stone' sells out to male titillation|last=Freedman|first=Samuel G. |date=Date TK, 2002|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=February 12, 2009[/tpl]
During the 1980s, the magazine began to shift focus towards being a general "entertainment" magazine. Music was still a dominant topic but there was increasing coverage of celebrities in television, films and the pop culture of the day. The magazine also initiated its annual "Hot Issue" during this time.
The printed format has gone through several changes. The first publications in 1967–72, were folded tabloid newspaper format, no staples with black ink text, and a single color highlight that changed each edition. From 1973 on, editions were done on a four-color press with a different newsprint paper size. In 1979, the bar code appeared. In 1980, it became a gloss paper, large format (10″×12″) magazine. As of October 30, 2008 edition, Rolling Stone is a smaller, standard-format magazine size. (USA Today,[tpl]Issue|date=April 2011[/tpl] Associated Press Anick Jesdanun)
On November 5, 2012, the magazine published its first cover in the Spanish language as recognition to the influence of Latino artists in American culture.

==Criticism==

One major criticism of Rolling Stone involves its generational bias toward the 1960s and 1970s. One critic referred to the Rolling Stone list of the "99 Greatest Songs" as an example of "unrepentant rockist fogeyism".May 9, 2006. Does hating rock make you a music critic? Jody Rosen. Slate. Article charging "RS" with "fogeyism." In further response to this issue, rock critic Jim DeRogatis, a former Rolling Stone editor, published a thorough critique of the magazine's lists in a book called Kill Your Idols: A New Generation of Rock Writers Reconsiders the Classics (ISBN 1-56980-276-9), which featured differing opinions from many younger critics.July 4, 2004. Idle worship, or revisiting the classics. Jim DeRogatis. Chicago Sun-Times.Article discussing intention of book Conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg criticised the magazine writing that "Rolling Stone has essentially become the house organ of the Democratic National Committee."Very Different Visions by Jonah Goldberg Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner has made all of his political donations to Democrats.[tpl]cite news|url=http://fundrace.huffingtonpost.com/neighbors.php?type=name&lname=wenner&fname=jann&search=Search |title=Jann Wenner Campaign Contributions and Donations – Huffington Post |publisher=Fundrace.huffingtonpost.com |date=September 22, 2010 |accessdate=October 15, 2010[/tpl]
Rolling Stone magazine has been criticized for reconsidering many classic albums that it had previously dismissed and (in recent years) for frequent abuse of the 3.5 star rating. Examples of artists for whom this is the case include, among others, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Nirvana, Weezer, Radiohead, Depeche Mode, Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, Outkast and Queen[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]. For example, Led Zeppelin was largely written off by Rolling Stone magazine critics during the band's most active years in the 1970s. However by 2006, a cover story on Led Zeppelin honored them as "the Heaviest Band of All Time".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shoutmouth.com/index.php/news/12829 |title=Documentation of attempt to change reviews |publisher=Shoutmouth.com |accessdate=August 18, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070630190730/http://www.shoutmouth.com/index.php/news/12829 |archivedate=June 30, 2007 [/tpl] A critic for Slate magazine described a conference at which 1984's The Rolling Stone Record Guide was scrutinized. As he described it, "The guide virtually ignored hip-hop and ruthlessly panned heavy metal, the two genres that within a few years would dominate the pop charts. In an auditorium packed with music journalists, you could detect more than a few anxious titters: How many of us will want our record reviews read back to us 20 years hence?"[tpl]cite web|last=Rosen |first=Jody |url=http://slate.com/id/2141418/ |title=Does hating rock make you a music critic? |publisher=Slate – Slate.com |date=May 9, 2006 |accessdate=August 18, 2011[/tpl] Another example of this bias was that the album Nevermind, by grunge band Nirvana, was given three stars in its original review, despite being placed at No. 17 in "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" list in 2003. Also, when The Beatles' Let It Be was released in 1970, the magazine originally gave the album a poor review, yet in 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it number 86 in the magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6598123/86_let_it_be |title=Search Articles, Artists, Reviews, Videos, Music and Movies |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=October 15, 2010[/tpl]

==Subsequent developments==

After years of declining readership, the magazine experienced a major resurgence of interest and relevance with the work of two young journalists in the late 2000s: Michael Hastings and Matt Taibbi.
In 2005, Dana Leslie Fields, former Publisher of Rolling Stone, who had worked at the Magazine for 17 years, was an inaugural inductee into the Magazine Hall of Fame.Media Industry News http://www.minonline.com/awards/seoy/SEOYwinners_pr.pdf
In 2009, Taibbi unleashed a scathing series of acclaimed reporting on the financial meltdown. He famously dubbed Goldman Sachs "The Great Vampire Squid."
Bigger headlines came at the end of June 2010. Rolling Stone caused a controversy in the White House by publishing in the July issue an article by journalist Michael Hastings, entitled, "The Runaway General",[tpl]cite web|author=By Michael Hastings |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/119236 |title=The Runaway General – Stanley McChrystal, Obama's top commander in Afghanistan, has seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the real enemy: The wimps in the White House |publisher=Rollingstone.com |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=August 18, 2011[/tpl] quoting criticism of General Stanley A.

In 2010, Taibbi documented illegal and fraudulent actions by banks in the foreclosure courts after traveling to Jacksonville, Florida and sitting in on hearings in the courtroom. His article, Invasion of the Home Snatchers also documented attempts by the judge to intimidate a homeowner fighting foreclosure and the attorney Taibbi accompanied into the court.Taibbi, Matt, Invasion of the Home Snatchers, Rolling Stone, November 10, 2010Charney, April, "that day... a stain on Jacksonville" statement, December 14, 2011 Occupy Jax advised by foreclosure attorney, 10:30–11:00, YouTube video uploaded December 15, 2011 [tpl]YouTube|AYtbCfIrR3U[/tpl]
In January 2012, the magazine ran exclusive excerpts from Hastings' book just prior to publication. The book, The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America’s War in Afghanistan, provided a much more expansive look at McChrystal and the culture of senior American military and how they get embroiled in these wars. It has been described as a boozy, sexy account of the misadventures of America's most notorious killers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] The book reached Amazon's bestseller list in the first 48 hours of release, and it received generally favorable reviews.

In 2012, financial scandals also continued to rock the world. Taibbi emerged as an expert who could explain the events as they unfolded. His articles garnered him invitations to nationally broadcast television programs.June 22, 2012 Bill Moyers ShowJuly 4, 2012 Viewpoint with Elliot Sputzer In a July discussion of the Libor revelations, Taibbi's coverageTaibbi, Matt, Why is Nobody Freaking Out About the LIBOR Scandal?, Rolling Stone, July 3, 2012 was singled out by Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, Inc., as becoming required reading to remain informed.

==Website==

Rolling Stone has maintained a website for many years, with selected current articles, reviews, blogs, MP3s, and other features such as searchable and free encyclopedic articles about artists, with images and sometimes sound clips of their work. The articles and reviews are sometimes in a revised form from the versions that are published.  There are also selected archival political and cultural articles and entries. The site also at one time had an extensive message board forum. By the late 1990s, the message board forum at the site had developed into a thriving community with a large number of regular members and contributors worldwide. The site was also plagued with numerous Internet trolls and malicious code-hackers who vandalized the forum substantially.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rsjunior.proboards18.com/index.cgi?board=tribunal&action=display&thread=1085021884&page=19 |title=RS.com Castaways – Troll Tribunal |publisher=Rsjunior.proboards18.com |accessdate=August 18, 2011[/tpl] Rolling Stone abruptly deleted the forum in May 2004. Rolling Stone began a new, much more limited message board community at their site in late 2005, only to remove it again in 2006. Rolling Stone also has a page at MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. In March 2008, the Rolling Stone website started a new message board section once again, then deleted it in April 2010. The magazine devotes one of its Table of Contents pages to promoting material currently appearing at its website, listing detailed links to the items.
