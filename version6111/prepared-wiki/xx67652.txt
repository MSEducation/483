The Black Rock Desert is a semi-arid region (in the Great Basin shrub steppe eco-region),  of lava beds and playa, or alkali flats, situated in the Black Rock Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area, a silt playa 100 miles north of Reno that encompasses more than 300,000 acres of land and contains more than 120 miles of historic trails. It is in the northern Nevada section of the Great Basin with a lakebed that is a dry remnant of Pleistocene Lake Lahontan. The average annual precipitation (years 1971-2000) at Gerlach (extreme south-west of the desert) is 7.90 inches (approx. 200Â mm).http://ggweather.com/normals/NV71.htm The Great Basin, named for the geography in which water is unable to flow out and remains in the basin, is a rugged land serrated by hundreds of mountain ranges, dried by wind and sun, with spectacular skies and scenic landscapes.http://blackrockdesert.org/friends/general-information The region is notable for its paleogeologic features, as an area of 19th-century Emigrant Trails to California, as a venue for rocketry, and as an alternative to the Bonneville Salt Flats in northwestern Utah, for setting land speed records (Mach 1.02 in 1997).  It is also the location for the annual Burning Man festival.
The Black Rock Desert is part of the National Conservation Area (NCA), a unit of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS). The NCA is located in northwest Nevada, and was established by legislation in 2000. It is a unique combination of desert playa, narrow canyons, and mountainous areas.
Humans have been in Black Rock Desert since approximately 11,000 BC. In 1300 BC the area was settled by the Paiute people. The large black rock formation was used as a landmark by the Paiute and later emigrants crossing the area. The landmark is a conical outcrop composed of interbedded Permian marine limestone and volcanic rocks.Gianella, V. P., and Larson, E. R., 1960, Marine Permian at Black Rock, Nevada: Geol. Soc. Amer, Abstract of meetings, Vancouver  At its base is a large hot spring and grassy meadow, which was an important place for those crossing the desert headed for California and Oregon. In 1843, John Fremont and his party were the first white men to cross the desert, and his trail was used by over half the 22,000 gold seekers headed to California after 1849. In 1867, Hardin City, a short-lived silver mill town was established (now a ghost town).

==Geography==

The Black Rock Desert region is in northwestern Nevada and the northwestern Great Basin. The playa extends for approximately [tpl]convert|100|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] northeast from the towns of Gerlach and Empire, between the Jackson Mountains to the east and the Calico Mountains to the west.
The Black Rock Desert is separated into two arms by the Black Rock Range. It lies at an elevation of [tpl]convert|3907|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] and has an area of about [tpl]convert|1000|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite book| first=John W.

There are several possible definitions of the extent of the Black Rock Desert. Often people refer just to the playa surface. Sometimes terrain which can be seen from the playa is included. The widest definition of the Black Rock Desert region is the watershed of the basin that drains into the playa. The intermittent Quinn River is the largest river in the region, starting in the Santa Rosa Range and ending in the Quinn River Sink on the playa south of the Black Rock Range. The watershed covers [tpl]convert|11600|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl][ref]
