CATEGORIES: Passports by country, Government of Cyprus

Cypriot passports are issued to Cyprus citizens to travel outside of the island of Cyprus. For traveling inside the European Union, Cyprus citizens can use their ID card.
The Civil Registry and Migration Department is responsible for issuing and renewing Cypriot Passports.
Despite the continuing division in Cyprus, due to the Turkish invasion of 1974, all Cypriot passports contain text in Greek as well as Turkish and English, as Greek and Turkish are the official languages of the Republic of Cyprus (according to the article 3, paragraph 1 of the Constitution of Cyprushttp://www.presidency.gov.cy/presidency/presidency.nsf/all/1003AEDD83EED9C7C225756F0023C6AD/$file/CY_Constitution.pdf?openelement). And despite the ethnic and physical division of Turkish Cypriots from the rest of the country, they can obtain passports and ID cards if they prove to be Cypriots by descent. Turkish settlers in the northern part of Cyprus are not entitled to Cypriot citizenship.
The new biometric passports are being issued since December 13, 2010 and in common with all European Union passports, includes text in all official languages of the European Union. They carry a microchip which biometric data of its holder are stored, such as fingerprints, biometric photograph and digital signature.http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/crmd/crmd.nsf/all/9f1f2f111a0d5100c22578e30035a468?opendocument Inside, on different pages there are images of a statue of goddess Aphrodite[tpl]cite news | first = Michele | last = Kambas | title = Goddess of Love emerges into foaming Cypriot row | date = Dec 23, 2010 | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BM1AA20101223?feedType=RSS&feedName=lifestyleMolt | work = reuters | accessdate = 2010-12-23[/tpl](on display in the Cyprus Museum), images of a dove carrying an olive branch (a well-known symbol of peace), images of the Cypriot mouflon and images of Kyrenia ship.
