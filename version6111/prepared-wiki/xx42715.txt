Grant was also paired with Sandra Bullock in Warner Bros.'s Two Weeks Notice, which made $199 million internationally but was judged poorly by professional reviewers.

Two Weeks Notice was followed by the 2003 ensemble comedy, Love Actually, headlined by Grant as the British Prime Minister. A Christmas release by Working Title Films, the film was promoted as "the ultimate romantic comedy" and accumulated $246 million at the international box office. It marked the directorial debut of Richard Curtis, who told the New York Times that Grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier Curtis incarnations.[tpl]cite news | first=Sara | last=Lyall | title=Four Comedies and a Collaboration |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EFD71F31F931A35752C1A9659C8B63 |work=The New York Times | date=3 November 2003 | accessdate=30 March 2008[/tpl] Roger Ebert claimed that "Grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian" and has "so much self-confidence that he plays the British prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport."[tpl]Cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | author-link = Roger Ebert | title = Movie Reviews: Love Actually | newspaper = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 7 November 2003 |accessdate=29 September 2007 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031107/REVIEWS/311070304/1023[/tpl] Film critic Rex Reed, on the contrary, called Grant's performance "an oversexed bachelor spin on Tony Blair" as the star "flirted with himself in the paroxysm of self-love that has become his acting style."[tpl]Cite news | last = Reed | first = Rex | author-link = Rex Reed | title = Lovesick Brits Ooze Treacle | newspaper = The New York Observer | date = 9 November 2003 |accessdate=29 September 2007 |url=http://www.observer.com/node/48296 | publisher = New York Observer | postscript =[/tpl]
A speech delivered by Grant in Love Actually – where he extols the virtues of Great Britain and refuses to cave to the pressure of its longstanding ally, the United States – was etched in the transatlantic memory as a satirical, wishful statement on the concurrent Bush-Blair relationship.[tpl]cite video |people=Hugh Grant (actor) and Thornton, Billy Bob (actor) |date=2003|title=Love Actually: Prime Minister confronts U.S. President |url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=PDiqDIWKSuw |medium= Motion picture |publisher=Universal Pictures |accessdate=17 October 2007 |time= |quote=[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Blair responded by saying, "I know there's a bit of us that would like me to do a Hugh Grant in Love Actually and tell America where to get off.

In 2004, Grant reprised his role as Daniel Cleaver for a small part in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, which, like its predecessor, made more than $262 million commercially. Gone from the screen for two years, Grant next reteamed with Paul Weitz (About a Boy) for the black comedy American Dreamz (2006). Grant starred as the acerbic host of an American Idol-like reality show where, according to Caryn James of the New York Times, "nothing is real ... except the black hole at the centre of the host's heart, as Mr. Grant takes Mr. Cowell's villainous act to its limit."[tpl]Cite news | last = James | first = Caryn | author-link = | title = Pop Beats Politics in the Race For Laughs | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 26 April 2006 |accessdate=29 September 2007 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E2D8123FF935A15757C0A9609C8B63 | postscript =[/tpl] American Dreamz failed financially but Grant was generously praised.

In 2007, Grant starred opposite Drew Barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called Music and Lyrics. The Associated Press described it as "a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy that's simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough."[tpl]Cite news | last = Lemire | first = Christy | author-link = | title = Review: 'Music and Lyrics' an Odd Combo |agency=Associated Press | date = 13 February 2007 |accessdate=29 September 2007 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/02/12/entertainment/e143605S25.DTL |work=San Francisco Chronicle | postscript =[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Though he neither listens to music nor owns any CDs, Grant learned to sing, play the piano, dance (a few mannered steps) and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a has-been pop singer, based loosely on Andrew Ridgeley.

A 2007 Vogue profile of Grant referred to him as a man with a "professionally misanthropic mystique."

A few months before firing his agent, he said, "They've known for years that I have total control. I've never taken any advice on anything."
He has stuck to the genre of comedy, especially the romantic comedy, for almost all of his mainstream film career. He also never ventures to play characters who are not British. While some film critics, such as Roger Ebert, have defended the limited variety of his performances, others have dismissed him as a one-trick pony. Eric Fellner, co-owner of Working Title Films and a long-time collaborator of Grant, said, "His range hasn't been fully tested, but each performance is unique."[tpl]cite news | first=Oliver | last=Marre | title=I want to be alone. Oh really? |url= |work=The Observer  | date=29 April 2007 | accessdate=11 September 2007[/tpl] A majority of Grant's popular films in the 1990s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love, often with an American woman. In earlier films, Grant was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed Englishman for humorous effects, allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously. These performances were sometimes deemed overbearing, in the words of Washington Post's Rita Kempley, due to his "comic overreactions—the mugging, the stuttering, the fluttering eyelids." She added: "He's got more tics than Benny Hill."[tpl]Cite news | last = Kempley | first = Rita | title ='Nine Months' | date = 12 July 1995 |accessdate=29 September 2007 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/ninemonthspg13kempley_c021e6.htm |newspaper=The Washington Post | postscript =[/tpl] Grant's penchant for conveying his characters' feelings with mannerisms, rather than direct emotions, has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style. Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post once stated that, to be effective as a comic performer, he must get "his jiving and shucking under control."[tpl]Cite news | last = Hunter | first = Stephen | title ='Music and Lyrics': Work Is What Makes Life Hum | date = 14 February 2007 |accessdate=29 September 2007 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/13/AR2007021301081.html |newspaper=The Washington Post | postscript =[/tpl] Film historian David Thomson wrote in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film about how it is merely "itchy mannerisms" that Grant equates with screen acting.[ref]David Thomson A New Biographical Dictionary of Film, London: Little 
Brown, 2002, p.352. Published in New York by Knopf.[/ref]
Nonetheless, Grant has shown versatility in some of his more low-profile efforts. He received nearly unanimous critical acclaim as a sleazy, snide community theatre director with a penchant for adolescent boys in the drama film An Awfully Big Adventure and for "a very quiet, dignified" performance as Frédéric Chopin in James Lapine's biopic film Impromptu. http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700000855/Impromptu.html[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE3DD1530F932A15754C0A963958260 | work=The New York Times | first=Janet | last=Maslin | title=FILM REVIEW; A Look at Hugh Grant Before His Big Success | date=21 July 1995[/tpl]

His preference for levity over dramatic range has been a controversial topic in establishment circles, prompting him to say:
However, in 2012, Grant played several non-comedic cameo roles in the epic drama film Cloud Atlas, an experience he has spoken about positively. He plays six characters in the film, all of which he said are "incredibly evil". Of his decision to appear in the film and of how difficult it was for him to play one of the more violent characters in the movie, he said:
[tpl]cquote|I do a lot of killing and raping the film... But it was a laugh.

And then I am suddenly standing in a cannibal skirt on a mountaintop in Germany and they are saying, "You know, hungry!

In 1996, Grant won substantial damages from News (UK) Ltd over what his lawyers called a "highly defamatory" article published in January 1995.

The arrest occurred about two weeks before the release of Grant's first major studio film, Nine Months, which he was scheduled to promote on several American television shows. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno had him booked for the same week.[tpl]cite book |last=Sweeney |first=Don |title=Backstage at the Tonight Show: From Johnny Carson to Jay Leno |publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing |location=Maryland, USA |page=210 |chapter=Tonight Show Hits the Road |date=June 2006[/tpl] In the much-watched interview, Grant was noted for not making excuses for the incident after Leno asked him, "What the hell were you thinking?"[tpl]cite news |url= |title=Hugh-man interest lifts 'Leno' rating |last=Lowry |page=5 |first=Brian |work=Variety |date=12 July 1995 |accessdate=17 February 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= |title=Grant confesses: No excuse for escapade |author=Kitty Bean Yancey, Jeannie Williams |page=1D |work=USA Today |date=11 July 1995 |accessdate=17 February 2007[/tpl] Grant answered, "I think you know in life what's a good thing to do and what's a bad thing, and I did a bad thing.

===Phone hacking exposé===

In April 2011 Grant published an article in the New Statesman entitled "The Bugger, Bugged"[tpl]cite news |title=The bugger, bugged |author=Hugh Grant |newspaper=New Statesman |date=12 April 2011 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/newspapers/2011/04/phone-yeah-cameron-murdoch [/tpl] about a conversation (following an earlier encounter) with Paul McMullan, former journalist and paparazzo for News of the World. In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the Daily Mail and News of the World, particularly Andy Coulson, had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from Margaret Thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with Rupert Murdoch and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks (née Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: "Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament – that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot."
When asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the Metropolitan Police to "drag their feet" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: "20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly."
Grant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of Grant himself "turning the tables" on a tabloid journalist.[tpl]cite news |title=From Stephen Fry to Hugh Grant: The rise of the celebrity activist |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 April 2011 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/apr/16/celebrity-activists-hugh-grant |location=London |first1=Leo |last1=Benedictus |first2=Josie |last2=Long[/tpl]
Whilst the allegations regarding the News of the World continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared for example on BBC Radio 4) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered Millie Dowler had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's News Corporation, culminating in a bravura performance on BBC television's Question Time in July 2011.[tpl]cite news |title=Hugh Grant's best role yet – scourge of News International |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 July 2011|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jul/08/hugh-grant-news-international-rupert-murdoch |location=London |first=Peter |last=Bradshaw[/tpl]
Grant said, "It's been fascinating to have a little excursion into another world. I really needed that and also to be dealing with real life instead of creating synthetic life, which is what I've been doing for the last 25 years."[tpl]cite web | url = http://ukscreen.com/articles/interviews/hugh-grant-prefers-politics-to-acting/ | title = Hugh Grant prefers politics to acting | first= Husam Sam | last = Asi | date=March 8, 2012 |publisher= UKScreen.com | accessdate= 2014-01-31[/tpl]

==Personal life==

In 1987, while playing Lord Byron in a Spanish production called Remando Al Viento (1988), Grant met actress Elizabeth Hurley, who was cast in a supporting role as Byron's former lover Claire Clairmont. Grant started dating the aspiring model while shooting and their relationship was subsequently the subject of much media attention. After 13 years together, Grant and Hurley made "a mutual and amicable decision" to split in May 2000.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=APAB&p_theme=apab&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=Hugh%20Grant%20and%20Elizabeth%20Hurley%20announce%20split&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(%22Hugh%20Grant%22%20and%20%22Elizabeth%20Hurley%20announce%20split%22)&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no |title=Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley announced split |agency=Associated Press |date=23 May 2000 |accessdate=17 February 2007 |work=Associated Press Archive[/tpl] Grant is godfather to Hurley's son Damian, born in 2002.[tpl]cite web|first=ANI|title=Liz Hurley's son finally permitted to watch godfather Hugh Grant's movie|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/liz-hurleys-son-finally-permitted-watch-godfather-hugh-132513227.html|publisher=Yahoo news|accessdate=21 April 2012[/tpl]
He subsequently began dating Jemima Khan under the intense scrutiny of British tabloids. Three years later, in February 2007, Grant's publicist announced that the couple had "decided to split amicably".[tpl]cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUKN1629135520070216 |title=Hugh Grant splits with girlfriend Jemima Khan |publisher=Reuters |date=16 February 2007 |accessdate=24 February 2007[/tpl]
In November 2011, it was announced that Grant had become a father to a baby girl, Tabitha, earlier that autumn.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/mar/16/hugh-grant-hacking-pirates-film |title=Hugh Grant: 'I love getting into a taxi and saying House of Lords instead of Soho – again'|work=The Guardian |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=19 March 2012 |location=London |first=Decca |last=Aitkenhead[/tpl] The identity of the mother, with whom Grant had a "fleeting affair" according to his publicist, was not at first announced; however, it was later revealed to be a Chinese woman, Tinglan Hong.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/nov/23/hugh-grant-leveson-inquiry-supplemental-statement|work=The Guardian |title=Hugh Grant's supplemental witness statement to the Leveson inquiry|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=23 November 2011|location=London[/tpl] In an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in April 2012, Grant revealed that his daughter's Chinese name is Xiao Xi, meaning "happy surprise".[tpl]cite episode|title=Hugh Grant on being a dad|series=The Ellen DeGeneres Show|airdate=2012-04-26|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQv5SZU5eM[/tpl] Grant and Hong reportedly briefly reunited in 2012. In February 2013, Grant announced that they had recently welcomed a son named Felix Chang.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9875027/Hugh-Grant-thrilled-with-his-new-baby-boy.html |title=Hugh Grant 'thrilled' with his new baby boy|work=The Telegraph|date=16 February 2013 |accessdate=16 February 2013 |location=London |first=Roya |last=Nikkhah[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://celebritybabies.people.com/2013/02/16/hugh-grant-announces-birth-of-son-on-twitter/|title=Hugh Grant Welcomes Son Felix Chang|work=People|date=16 February 2013 |accessdate=16 February 2013[/tpl]
Grant has claimed that Hong has been "badly treated" by the media, saying that press intrusion prevented him from attending the birth of his daughter in September 2011. Grant said, "I was at one of the party conferences, about to give a speech, and was pacing about on the end of the phone. I shouldn’t have gone to the hospital at all, because it brought all this attention down on the mother's head. But I couldn't really resist it, so I went on the second day". Hong later obtained an injunction which allowed Hugh Grant to visit her and baby Tabitha in peace.

In 2011, the BBC apologised after Grant made an offhand joke about homosexuality and rugby when he was invited into the commentary box during coverage of an England V Scotland game at Twickenham Stadium. Talking about playing rugby during his school days, Grant said: "I discovered it hurt less if you tackled hard than if you tackled like a queen."http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/03/14/bbc-apologises-for-hugh-grants-gay-rugby-comment/
