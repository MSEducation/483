The entry in the Domesday Book for North and South Radworthy stated a population of twelve households (eight villagers and four slaves) which was tax assessed to pay a total of 0.3 geld units. The land value in 1086 was recorded as £3 which was an increase from the c.1070 recording of £0.8. The Lord in 1066 was Alward son of Toki but this changed in 1086 to William the Goat, who was also Tenant-in-Chief. The agricultural land in North and South Radworthy consisted of three ploughlands (two lord's plough teams and one men's plough teams); 0.12 lord's lands; one acre of meadow land; forty acres of pasture land; one league of woodland and one furlong of mixed measures. The land held ten cattle, four pigs and fifty sheep.[tpl]cite web| url=http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/XX0000/north-and-south-radworthy/ |title = North & South Radworthy| work=OPEN DOMESDAY | accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://domesdaymap.co.uk/media/images/cropped/5108-1.png |title = North & South Radworthy Entry Scan| work=OPEN DOMESDAY ENTRY SCAN | accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl]
