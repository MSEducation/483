CATEGORIES: Latin Grammy Award for Record of the Year

The Latin Grammy Award for Record of the Year is an honor presented annually at the Latin Grammy Awards, a ceremony that recognizes excellence and creates a wider awareness of cultural diversity and contributions of Latin recording artists in the United States and internationally.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latingrammy.com/pages/LARAS|title=Sobre La Academia Latina de la Grabación|language=Spanish|publisher=Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences|accessdate=July 17, 2011[/tpl] The award is given to the performers, producers, audio engineers and mastering engineer for new songs in Spanish or Portuguese language.

Eleven of the thirteen awarded songs have also earned the Latin Grammy for Song of the Year, which unlike this category, is given to the songwriters. The exceptions to this were in 2000 and 2009, when "Dímelo" by Marc Anthony and "Aquí Estoy Yo" by Luis Fonsi featuring David Bisbal, Noel Schajris and Aleks Syntek, respectively, received the Song of the Year award without earning Record of the Year.
Alejandro Sanz has won the most awards in the category with five wins out of eight nominations, including the award received for "La Tortura", his collaboration with Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira, the only female singer to be awarded. Sanz is followed by Juanes with two winning songs, "Es Por Ti" and "Me Enamora". "Livin' la Vida Loca" by Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin is the only song to be nominated for this award in its Spanish-language version and to receive the same distinction for the English language version at the 42nd Grammy Awards.[tpl]cite news|title=The Nominees for the Grammy Awards|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2000-01-05/entertainment/17634952_1_sogno-andrea-bocelli-beautiful-stranger-madonna-unpretty-dallas-austin/1|accessdate=July 18, 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=January 5, 2000|page=1[/tpl] Most nominated songs were recorded in Spanish language, though "Esperando Na Janela" by Gilberto Gil, "Ja Sei Namorar" by Tribalistas, "A Festa" by Maria Rita, "Dois Rios" by Skank, "Arlequim Desconhecido" by Ivan Lins and The Metropole Orchestra, "Tua" by  Maria Bethânia, and "Atrás de Porta" by Ivete Sangalo, recorded in Portuguese language, were also nominated.
