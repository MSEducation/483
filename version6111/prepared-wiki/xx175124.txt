==History==

The station went on the air as KROE-FM on December 5, 1977, becoming Sheridan, Wyoming's first FM radio station. KROE-FM's 20,000 Watt transmitter was located in the new KROE building and the signal was broadcast to the Sheridan area from an antenna mounted on the KROE tower.
Through most of the 1980s and the early to mid 1990s, KROE-FM aired various satellite-delivered Adult Contemporary music formats.  Responding to local demand, the format was shifted to a more rock-oriented lineup toward the later part of that decade. On June 30, 1997, the station changed its call sign to KZWY.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=38627&Callsign=KZWY |title=KZWY Call Sign History |work=United States Federal Communications Commission, audio division [/tpl]  Along with the call letter change, the music format was solidified with a locally programmed rock format and a new slogan:  "Rock and Roll from Yesterday and Today."  Also in the late 1990s, the station was moved to a new transmitter site at the top of the Big Horn Mountains and the power was increased to 75,000 Watts.  This allowed the station to cover a large portion of Northeast Wyoming, including most of Sheridan, Johnson and Campbell counties.
In 2003, the slogan was modified to "Wyoming's Best Rock," while the format continued to be a mix of classic and new rock.  Most of the programming on KZWY remained locally generated, but some nationally syndicated weekend shows were added including The Beatle Years, Flashback, The House of Hair, The Tour Bus and Harddrive.  In 2012, Lovcom, Inc. signed on KOWY at 102.3 FM, and the Adult contemporary format which had been airing on KLQQ-HD2 was moved to this new station. "Magic 95.9" became "Magic 102.3."  Meanwhile, the hybrid rock library on KZWY was split into two distinct formats.  At the end of May 2012, KZWY began airing a straight classic rock format with an accompanying slogan change to "Wyoming's Classic Rock," while the new rock was moved to the newly available KLQQ-HD2 (and corresponding translator K240DW), which was relaunched as an Active Rock station branded "95.9 The Edge."
KZWY began broadcasting in HD Radio in the fall of 2005.  Initially, a heavier rock format called "Nitro" was aired on the HD-2 channel and ESPN Radio on HD-3.  Various HD multicast format changes occurred over the next few years, eventually settling on a Waitt Radio Networks Oldies format on HD-2 and eliminating the HD-3 channel.  The Oldies channel is called "Oldies 105.9" because it is rebroadcast on two analog translators (K290BL and K290BM), both at 105.9 FM.  In 2013, failures in the HD equipment on KLQQ forced a move of the Active Rock format from KLQQ-HD2 to KZWY-HD3.  As of 2014, KZWY is the only station in the Lovcom group broadcasting in HD Radio.

==Translators==

These translators both rebroadcast KZWY's HD-2 programming, which is branded as "Oldies 105.9" to reflect the dial position of the translators on which it appears.
