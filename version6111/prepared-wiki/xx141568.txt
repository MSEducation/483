[[Rasmussen's aneurysm]]

CATEGORIES: Vascular diseases, Tuberculosis

Rasmussen's aneurysm is a pulmonary artery aneurysm adjacent or within a tuberculous cavity. It occurs in up to 5% of patients with such lesions. It may lead to rupture and haemorrhage. It is named after Fritz Valdemar Rasmussen. It is quoted as the cause of hemoptysis in tuberculosis patients.
While the "classic" terminology relates the lesion to cavitary tuberculosis, the term is now used for the anatomic aneurysm associated with other destructive lung lesions.  Even when the pulmonary aneurysm is present, the actual bronchial  bleeding may be from the bronchial artery, rather than from the pulmonary artery.
