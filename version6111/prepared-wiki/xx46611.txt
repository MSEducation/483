Although the school is particularly well known for its corporate and criminal law faculty, it offers a very extensive curriculum and hosts various student groups, research centers and activities. Penn Law students also publish the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, the oldest law journal in the country."University of Pennsylvania Law School Sesquicentennial History", University of Pennsylvania Almanac, accessed 15 Sep 2011 Among the school's alumni are a US Supreme Court Justice, several state Supreme Court Justices and supreme court justices of foreign countries, as well as several founders of law firms, university presidents and deans, business entrepreneurs, and politicians.

==History==

The University of Pennsylvania Law School officially traces its origins to a series of lectures delivered in 1790 by James Wilson, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/about/history/ |title=History of Penn Law |publisher=Law.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2011[/tpl] Following this early beginning, Penn began offering a full-time program in law in 1850, under the leadership of George Sharswood, an innovator in legal education.  Under Sharswood's leadership, Penn Law created what has become the template for modern legal education: a combination of lectures in law with practical experience for students. In 1852 Penn Law was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence, then called The American Law Register, which was later renamed to the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, one of the most-cited law journals in the world.http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx
The School entered a new era when William Draper Lewis was named dean in 1896. Lewis aspired to put Penn Law in the first rank of law schools in the country. He convinced the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania that the school needed to move to a new building, and in 1900,Owen Roberts, William Draper Lewis, 98 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1 (1949) the new Law School building (now Silverman Hall) opened in its present site on the Penn campus with its massive Georgian structure of brick and limestone with ornamental details throughout. It was at the time considered the largest structure devoted solely to legal education in the country. Under Lewis' deanship the law school was also one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today. As legal education became more formalized the School initiated a three-year curriculum and instituted stringent admissions requirements. While the School continued to accept students that did not hold a bachelor's degree, it warned applicants that "a large number of those who study law are college graduates; and those who are not cannot hope, except in rare instances, to compete successfully with the college man.""Department of Law," Catalogue of the University of Pennsylvania, 1899-1900 234 (1899).
After completing almost 30 years within the ranks of the law school, Lewis eventually devoted his powers to founding the American Law Institute, in 1925, which was seated in the law school and was chaired by Lewis himself. The ALI was later chaired by another of Penn Law's Deans, Herbert Funk Goodrich. Two years before Goodrich was named Dean, the law school graduated with a J.D. Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander (in 1927), the first African-American woman to ever receive a Ph.D. in the United States (also from the University of Pennsylvania, in economics). The first woman to join the faculty was Martha Field in 1969, now a professor at Harvard Law School, while the first black woman to join the faculty was Regina Austin (in 1977) who is still teaching at Penn.

==Campus==

The University of Pennsylvania campus covers over 269 acres (~1 km²) in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City district. All of Penn's schools, including the Law School, and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. Recent improvements to the surrounding neighborhood include the opening of several restaurants, a large upscale grocery store, and a movie theater on the western edge of campus. Much of Penn's architecture was designed by the architecture firm of Cope & Stewardson, whose principal architects combined the Gothic architecture of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge with the local landscape to establish the Collegiate Gothic style.
The Law School consists of four interconnecting buildings around a central courtyard.  At the east end of the courtyard is Silverman Hall built in 1900, housing the Levy Conference Center, classrooms, faculty offices, the Gittis Center for Clinical Legal Studies, and administrative and student offices.  Directly opposite is Tanenbaum Hall, which opened in 1993, home to the Biddle Law Library several law journals, administrative offices, and comfortable student spaces. The law library houses 1,053,824 volumes and volume equivalents making it the 4th largest law library in the country.http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/university-of-pennsylvania-03140 Gittis Hall sits on the north side and has new state-of-the-art classrooms (renovated in 2006) and new and expanded faculty offices.  Opposite is the recently  finished Golkin Hall, a new building that contains [tpl]convert|40000|sqft|m2[/tpl] and includes a state-of-the-art court room, 350-seat auditorium, seminar rooms, faculty and administrative offices, a two-story entry hall, and a roof-top garden.  Golkin Hall is awaiting LEED certification by the U.S. Green Building Council.  The building project cost approximately $33.5 million, and was completed in early 2012.
A small row of restaurants and shops faces the Law School on Sansom Street.  North of Penn Law, on Chestnut Street, is a new deluxe apartment complex with retail outlets.  Nearby are the Penn Bookstore, the Pottruck Center (a new [tpl]convert|115000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] multi-purpose sports activity area), the Institute of Contemporary Art, a performing arts center, and area shops.

===School orientation===

Throughout its modern history Penn Law has been well known for its collegiality and its strong focus on inter-disciplinary studies, a character that was shaped early on by Dean William Draper Lewis.Margaret Center Klingelsmith, "History of the Department of Law of the University of Pennsylvania," The Proceedings at the Dediction of the New Building of the Department of Law, February 21st and 22nd, 1900, 16-18 (George Erasmus Nitzsche, comp. 1901). Its medium-size student body and the tight integration with the rest of Penn's schools (the "One University Policy")[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/uplan/paoneuniv1972.pdf |title=Pennsylvania: One University |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Archives |year=1973 |accessdate=2011-09-05[/tpl] have been instrumental in achieving those aims. More than 50% of the School's courses are interdisciplinary, while the School offers more than 20 joint and dual degree programs, including a JD/MBA (Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania), a JD/PhD in Communication (Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania), and a JD/MD (Perelman School of Medicine). Various certificate programs that can be completed within the 3-year JD program are also available, e.g. in Business and Public Policy (in conjunction with the Wharton School), in Cross-Sector Innovation (with the School of Social Policy & Practice), and in International Business and Law (the Themis Joint Certificate with ESADE Law School, Barcelona, Spain). Nineteen percent of the Class of 2007 earned a Certificate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/crossdisc/study/certificates/ |title=Penn Law – Certificates of Study |publisher=Law.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2011[/tpl] Penn Law also offers joint degrees with international affiliates such as Sciences Po (France), ESADE (Spain), and the University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law. Under the guidance of Penn's current Dean, professor Michael A. Fitts, the School has further expanded its international programs with the addition of the International Internship Program, the International Summer Human Rights Program, and the Global Research Seminar, all under the umbrella of the Penn Law Global Initiative. Penn Law takes part in a number of international annual events, such as the Monroe E. Price Media Law Moot Court Competition at the University of Oxford.[tpl]cite web|title=2011 International Rounds in Oxford – Results|url=http://pricemootcourt.socleg.ox.ac.uk/competitions/oxford/2011/results|publisher=University of Oxford – Price Media Law Moot Court Programme|accessdate=3 June 2012[/tpl]

===Career prospects===

In terms of student career focus the School combines a strong tradition in public service with being one of the top feeders of law students to the most prestigious law firms.http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202483173162&slreturn=1&hbxlogin=1 Penn Law was the first top-ranked law school to establish a mandatory pro bono requirement, and the first law school to win American Bar Association's Pro Bono Publico Award. Nevertheless, still about 75% of each graduating class enters private practice. In 2012, Penn Law placed more than 60% of its graduates into the United States' top 250 law firms, maintaining Penn Law's rank as the number one law school in the nation for the percentage of students securing employment at these top law firms.http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202589189668&interactive=true National Law Journal law.com.

===Journals===

Students at the Law School publish several legal journals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/prospective/studentactivities.html |title=List of Student Activities |publisher=Law.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2011[/tpl] The flagship publication is the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, the oldest law review in the United States.http://www.pennumbra.com Penn Law Review started in 1852 as the American Law Register and was renamed to its current title in 1908. It is one of the most cited law journals in the world, and one of the four journals that are responsible for the Bluebook (along with the Harvard, Yale and Columbia law journals). Penn Law Review articles have captured seminal historical moments in the 19th and 20th century, such as the passage of the 19th Amendment, the lawlessness of the first and second World War, the rise of the civil rights movement and the war in Vietnam.Edwin J. Greenlee, The University of Pennsylvania Law Review: 150 Years of History, 150 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1875 (2002)

==Notable faculty==

Penn Law's faculty is selected to match the School's inter-disciplinary orientation. Seventy percent of the standing faculty hold advanced degrees beyond the JD, and more than a third hold secondary appointments in other departments at the University. The School is particularly well known for its corporate law group, with professors William Bratton, Jill Fisch, Edward Rock, David Skeel, and Michael Wachter being regularly included among the best corporate and securities law scholars in the country.Corporate Practice Commentator's "Top 10" Corporate & Securities Articles for 2010, available at http://www.professorbainbridge.com/professorbainbridgecom/2011/05/corporate-practice-commentators-top-10-corporate-securities-articles-for-2010.html The School has also built a strong reputation for its law and economics group (professors Howard F. Chang, Tom Baker, David S. Abrams) and its criminal law group (professors Stephanos Bibas, David Rudovsky). Some of the notable Penn Law faculty members include:
