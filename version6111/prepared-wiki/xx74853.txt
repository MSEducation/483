==Car plant==

The former factory (also known as the Ryton plant) was a feature of the village for more than 60 years. It was situated between the A45 (on the north-east) and the A423 (on the south-west) in Warwickshire. The south-east of the factory site bordered with Ryton-on-Dunsmore village.
The factory was originally constructed by the Rootes Group in 1940 to build aircraft engines during the Second World War. After the war it became the headquarters of the Rootes Group, but when the organisation entered financial difficulties in the 1960s the company (in stages) and thus the plant was taken over by the American car-making giant Chrysler. Chrysler itself entered financial difficulties and sold the plant for a symbolic US$1.00 to PSA Peugeot CitroÃ«n in 1978.
Peugeot started building its 309 model there on 28 October 1985, and by the end of 1987 it had been joined by the 405. When 309 production ceased in early 1993, the 306 took its place and for a while was the mainstay of production after the 405's demise in the autumn of 1995. The second production line was revived over the summer of 1998 with the commencement of 206 production, and the 206 was the only car produced at the plant after the end of 306 production in the spring of 2001.
In April 2006, Peugeot decided that the Ryton plant would close during 2007. In the event, it closed on 12 December 2006 and the [tpl]convert|140|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] site was sold to developer Trenport Investments Ltd for industrial use in March 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abcmoney.co.uk/news/20200742500.htm |title=PSA Peugeot Citroen agrees to sell Ryton site to Trenport Investments Limited |publisher=Abcmoney.co.uk |accessdate=16 May 2012[/tpl] Demolition of the plant began on 12 November 2007.http://www.therugbyobserver.co.uk/news.tvt?_scope=Flow/Websites/Rugby/News&id=27878
