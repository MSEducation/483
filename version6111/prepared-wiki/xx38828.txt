===Criticism of appointment to the Dropbox board===

On Wednesday, April 9, 2014, Dropbox announced Rice's appointment to the Dropbox board of directors. Dropbox founder and CEO Drew Houston said her addition would help the firm “expand our global footprint". However, Rice's appointment sparked an angry outcry from Internet activists, who cited the former Secretary of State's support for the National Security Agency’s warrantless wiretapping program during the George W. Bush administration, called for a boycott of Dropbox, and in a blog post on a site that's leading the call for the boycott, Drop-Dropbox.com, wrote: “This is deeply disturbing, and anyone – or any business – who values ethics should be concerned." The post continued, “Given everything we now know about the U.S.’s warrantless surveillance program, and Rice’s role in it, why on earth would we want someone like her involved with Dropbox, an organization we are trusting with our most important business and personal data?”
