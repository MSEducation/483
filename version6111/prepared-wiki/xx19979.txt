Ukonline was a "portal" website of the UK Government linking to public sector information. The site was launched in 2001 and maintained by the Office of the e-Envoy (later the e-Government Unit, part of the Cabinet Office).
The site featured news, links, and search facilities connecting together much of the government's web presence, though later this pan-government search facility was removed. Visitors to the site were able to search for information on a variety of topics (for example, agriculture, finance and health) and retrieve a list of government departments that were able to provide them with more information. It was also possible to do such things as apply for a passport, buy a television licence, register to vote or complete and send a Tax Self Assessment form, but only if users left the website, as they could not actually perform the transaction on UKonline.
The site was replaced in 2004 by the service Directgov, which was then replaced in 2012 by the service Gov.uk.
There is still a network of community internet access points called the UK Online Centres network, run by the Tinder Foundation.http://www.ukonlinecentres.com
