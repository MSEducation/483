Sergei Vladimirovich Brylin ([tpl]lang-ru|Серге́й Влади́мирович Бры́лин[/tpl]; born January 13, 1974) is a Russian professional ice hockey center who is currently a Free Agent. He most recently played for Metallurg Novokuznetsk of the Kontinental Hockey League. He is a three-time Stanley Cup champion with the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League.
Brylin can successfully play all three forward positions, albeit usually in a defensive role, and has been called upon to play on any of the top 3 lines. His quiet work ethic and versatility made him a valuable part of the team. Brylin has won three Stanley Cup championships with the Devils in 1995, 2000, and 2003. Brylin is one of five Devils who have played for all three of their championship teams, the only others being Martin Brodeur, Scott Niedermayer, Scott Stevens, and Ken Daneyko.
On July 1, 2008, the Devils turned down the option to have Brylin return for another year and ten days later he signed with SKA St. Petersburg of the KHL.
After hopes of returning to the Devils for one more season faded, Brylin signed with Metallurg Novokuznetsk for the 2011–12 KHL season.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.hockeysverige.se/article/12254078/byter-ner-sig-till-superjumbon | title = Brylin joins Metallurg | publisher = Hockeysverige.se | date = 2011-08-23 | accessdate = 2011-08-23 | language = Swedish[/tpl] Currently, Brylin is working in a special assignment capacity with the Devils.
