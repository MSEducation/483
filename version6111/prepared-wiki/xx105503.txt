His poems have been translated in many languages, and he himself translated works from Russian, Bulgarian, Turkish and Macedonian authors, including Vladimir Mayakovsky, Anna Akhmatova and Nazim Hikmet.
Among his close friends were Serbian poet Desanka Maksimović and Montenegrin novelist Mihailo Lalić .

His wife Vera (who died in 2003) was also a translator from the Russian, and his daughter Mirka from the Italian.
