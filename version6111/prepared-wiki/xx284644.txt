==Plot==

Gonzalo García Pelayo (Lluís Homar) has been trying for years to work out a system to legally win money in a local casino, which is run by the infamous The Beast (Eduard Fernández). When he realizes he has succeeded in doing so, using a system based on wheel bias, he drags his family in to help — son Iván (Daniel Brühl), daughter Vanessa (Marina Salas), their cousins Marcos (Oriol Vila) and muscle-bound Alfredo (Miguel Ángel Silvestre), and family friend Balón (Vicente Romero).
Driven by Ivan’s desire to give his father a decent old age, the gang sets to work, at first unsuccessfully. But when they start winning, the Beast’s suspicions are aroused, and he puts a private detective onto them. Alfredo compromises the plan by getting involved with croupier Ingrid (Blanca Suárez), who is summarily fired by the Beast. Next, Iván starts a romance with Chinese wild girl Shui (Hui Chi Chiu), whose friends turn out to be quite handy later on.

==Reception==

===Critical response===

The film received mixed to negative reviews from film critics. Jonathan Holland of the Variety wrote, "Ocean's Eleven tries to become a Hispanic Magnificent Seven in Winning Streak a disappointingly straight-ahead take on one family’s high-risk attempt to get rich by beating the casinos. Despite its terrific real-life storyline, a couple of fine perfs and slick visuals, the pic stumbles in its eagerness to please all comers, failing to generate much real tension and leaving its characters as flat as poker chips".[tpl]cite news|url=http://variety.com/2012/film/reviews/winning-streak-1117947539/ |work=Variety |first=Jonathan |last=Holland |title=Winning Streak |date=11 May 2012 |accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl] Sonia Sanz of Cultture.com criticized actors Daniel Brühl, Lluís Homar, Oriol Vila, Eduard Fernández and Blanca Suárez for their "underwhelming" performances, and called the film itself "disappointing".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cultture.com/43119-critica-de-the-pelayos-sobredosis-de-guaycismo-y-fallo-en-el-ritmo |date=27 April 2012 |title=Crítica de 'The Pelayos': sobredosis de guaycismo y fallo en el ritmo |first=Sonia |last=Sanz |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 August 2013 |work=Cultture.com[/tpl] Emilio Luna of the El Antepenúltimo Mohicano gave the film a rather negative review and awarded it with four out of ten stars.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.elantepenultimomohicano.com/2012/05/pelayos-eduard-cortes-2012.html |title=The Pelayos (Eduard Cortés, 2012) |first=Emilio |last=Luna |language=Spanish |work=El Antepenúltimo Mohicano |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]
In a more positive review of the film, Patrick Mullen of Cinemablographer.com wrote, "Brühl and Homar’s work is worth noting since they manage to draw out characters that don’t seem to be part of the film’s thin script. ... Winning Streak is a fun little caper all the same, slight as it may be. Winning Streak probably won’t break the bank, but it should at least break even", and gave the film three out of five stars.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cinemablographer.com/2012/11/euff-review-winning-streak.html |title=EUFF Review: 'Winning Streak'  |date=18 November 2012 |work=Cinemablographer.com |first=Patrick |last=Mullen |accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]
