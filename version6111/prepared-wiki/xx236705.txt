[[Trude]]

CATEGORIES: Kath & Kim characters

Trude is a fictional character featured in the Australian television series, Kath & Kim and is portrayed by Gina Riley. Trude is a snobby middle-aged shop assistant. Trude has a friend called Prue, and they work a few hours a week in an unnamed homewares store at the Fountain Gate Shopping Center. The two of them like to pick on Kath Day-Knight and Kel Knight; occasionally Sharon Strzelecki and Kim Craig as they come in, but not to their face. Trude is married to a plastic surgeon called Graham, who never appears in the show but is frequently mentioned. Both Trude and Prue speak in an exaggerated version of the cultivated Australian accent, which can be heard in certain higher socio-economic areas of Melbourne and Sydney.
