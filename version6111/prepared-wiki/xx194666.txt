==History==

Having to deal with the pressure they encountered due to their instant success after the release of their two preceding albums, Hale decided to make a 10-month hiatus from the music industry as they reasoned out it was affecting their status as musical artistes and their performances.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/1887/Hale-releases-third-EMI-album-Above,-Over-and-Beyond|title=Hale releases third EMI album "Above, Over and Beyond"|publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal|accessdate=2008-05-01| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080501170339/http://www.pep.ph/guide/1887/Hale-releases-third-EMI-album-Above,-Over-and-Beyond| archivedate= 1 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] During their time of hiatus, they established the Treehouse Productions where they would help the needy children suffering from illnesses through music.[tpl]cite web |url=http://treehouseproductions.multiply.com/|title=Treehouse Productions|publisher=multiply.com|accessdate=2007-07-03[/tpl]
It was not long until Hale was motivated to put in work for their third effort. After the release of the first single of this album, Pitong Araw, the album was later released on April 28, 2008.
