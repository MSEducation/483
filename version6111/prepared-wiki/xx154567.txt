[[4-Track Mind]]

CATEGORIES: 1997 albums, Jez Spencer albums

4-Track Mind is an album by the band Jez Spencer, which was a project of Spencer Gibb, son of Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees, prior to the formation of 54 Seconds.  The album was recorded in the spring and summer of 1997 at Gibb's home in Austin, Texas and is considered by some fans to be the first 54 Seconds album, as it includes three founding members (Gibb, Johnson, and Cochran).  The album was originally released in 1997, but was remastered and reissued in 2001 after 54 Seconds became popular.
