Because of the outbreaks within college and university settings, many governments have established vaccination programs to prevent large-scale outbreaks. In Canada, provincial governments and the Public Health Agency of Canada have all participated in awareness campaigns to encourage students ranging from grade 1 to college and university to get vaccinated.Table 2: Provincial and Territorial recommendations for mumps-containing immunization, 2007, Information on Outbreaks of Mumps In Canada - Information for Health Professionals, Public Health Agency Canada
Some anti-vaccine activists protest against the administration of a vaccine against mumps, claiming that the attenuated vaccine strain is harmful, and/or that the wild disease is beneficial. There is no evidence whatsoever to support the claim that the wild disease is beneficial, or that the MMR vaccine is harmful. Claims have been made that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism and inflammatory bowel disease, including one study by Andrew Wakefield"Critical flaws" in Andrew Wakefield's studiesAndrew Wakefield's downfall (the paper was discredited and retracted in 2010 and Wakefield was later stripped of his license after his work was found to be an "elaborate fraud" [tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/05/autism.vaccines/index.html|title= Retracted autism study an 'elaborate fraud,' British journal finds|author=Cohen, Elizabeth;Falco, Miriam |date= 5 January 2011|work= |publisher=CNN |accessdate=16 May 2011[/tpl]) that indicated a link between gastrointestinal disease, autism, and the MMR vaccine. Also, subsequent studies indicate no link between vaccination with the MMR and autism.[tpl]cite journal |author=Demicheli V, Rivetti A, Debalini MG, Di Pietrantonj C |title=Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=2 |issue= |pages=CD004407 |year=2012 |pmid=22336803 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub3[/tpl] Since the dangers of the disease are well known, while the dangers of the vaccine are quite minimal, most doctors recommend vaccination.
The WHO, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the British Medical Association and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain currently recommend routine vaccination of children against mumps. The British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain had previously recommended against general mumps vaccination, changing that recommendation in 1987. In 1988 it became United Kingdom government policy to introduce mass child mumps vaccination programmes with the MMR vaccine, and MMR vaccine is now routinely administered in the UK.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
Before the introduction of the mumps vaccine, the mumps virus was the leading cause of viral meningoencephalitis in the United States. However, encephalitis occurs rarely (less than 2 per 100,000).[tpl]cite book | author = Atkinson W, Humiston S, Wolfe C, Nelson R (Editors). | title = Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases | edition = 9th | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and prevention | year = 2006 | id =  Fulltext [/tpl] In one of the largest studies in the literature, the most common symptoms of mumps meningoencephalitis were found to be fever (97%), vomiting (94%) and headache (88.8%).[tpl]cite journal | author=Kanra G, Isik P, Kara A, Cengiz AB, Secmeer G, Ceyhan M | title=Complementary findings in clinical and epidemiologic features of mumps and mumps meningoencephalitis in children without mumps vaccination | journal=Pediatr Int | year=2004 | pages=663–8 | volume=46 | issue=6 | pmid=15660864  | doi = 10.1111/j.1442-200x.2004.01968.x[/tpl] The mumps vaccine was introduced into the United States in December 1967: since its introduction there has been a steady decrease in the incidence of mumps and mumps virus infection. There were 151,209 cases of mumps reported in 1968. Since 2001, the case average was only 265 per year, excluding an outbreak of >6000 cases in 2006 attributed largely to university contagion in young adults.[ref]

==Treatment==

There is no specific treatment for mumps. Symptoms may be relieved by the application of intermittent ice or heat to the affected neck/testicular area and by acetaminophen/paracetamol for pain relief.  Warm saltwater gargles, soft foods, and extra fluids may also help relieve symptoms.  Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is not used due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.
According to the Department of Health of Minnesota there is no effective post-exposure recommendation to prevent secondary transmission, nor is the post-exposure use of vaccine or immunoglobulin effective.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/diseases/mumps/hcp/clinical.html |title=Mumps Clinical Information - Minnesota Dept. of Health |work= |accessdate=[/tpl]
Patients are advised to avoid acidic foods and beverages, since these stimulate the salivary glands, which can be painful.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/mumps-000112.htm |title=Mumps |author= |date= |work=Complementary and Alternative Medicine Guide |publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center|accessdate=16 May 2011[/tpl]

==Prognosis==

Death is very unusual. The disease is self-limiting, and general outcome is good, even if other organs are involved. Known complications of mumps include:
After the illness, lifelong immunity to mumps generally occurs; reinfection is possible but tends to be mild and atypical.[tpl]cite journal |author= Senanayake SN |title=Mumps: a resurgent disease with protean manifestations |journal= Med J Aust |volume=189 |issue=8 |pages=456–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18928441 |doi= |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/189_08_201008/sen10220_fm.html[/tpl]
