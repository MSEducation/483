[[Strong female character]]

CATEGORIES: Stock characters, Portrayals of women

Strong female character is a term for a class of stock character. It is the opposite of the damsel in distress stock character. 
While such characters could be used by authors to question implicit assumptions about male privilege and patriarchy in the first half of the 20th century, the rise of mainstream feminism and the inflationary use of the concept in the later 20th century have reduced the concept to a standard item of pop culture fiction.
Contemporary pop culture franchises tend to optimise their female stock characters to appeal to both male and female audiences (Lara Croft). The "strong female character" is not necessarily physically strong or an "action heroine" but can reveal "strong" character with relevance to the plot (as heroine or villainess), often taking the role of a sexually attractive femme fatale.
