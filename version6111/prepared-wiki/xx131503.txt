Chariot Race is a racing game released in 1983 by Micro Antics. A two dimensional game which involved the player racing to the end of the track while trying to take out his opponent.

==Description==

Chariot Race ran on the unexpanded Commodore VIC-20 which had 5k of memory. This game also featured the ability to play with another player on the same computer (which was a quite unusual for a 2 player game for the time and machine). The object of the game was for the player to race his Chariot along the track avoiding side walls and other oncoming chariots. Competing chariots could take him out of the race by either pushing the player into another chariot or making him crash into the arena walls.
Unlike other games where the player just levels up Chariot Race did have a finish line which allowed one of the two players to be the winner.
