==Club career==

===Australia===

A product of Epping Boys High School, Gallagher spent his junior career at Gladesville Spirit, the NSW Institute of Sport and Manly United FC before being signed for the Sydney FC National Youth League team.Sydney Morning Herald - Young Socceroo Sam has world at his feet
He was called into the senior Sydney FC team on 8 January 2010, as an injury replacement player for Matthew Jurman, who was ruled out for the rest of the season with an injury.Manly Daily - Young Sam signs up with Sydney FCYoung Gallagher Signs On At Sydney FC
On 19 March 2010, it was announced that Gallagher had signed a senior contract with the Central Coast Mariners starting from the 2010-11 season.CCMariners.com.au - Mariners make double swoop He eventually left the club in 2012, having made just 1 out of a possible 61 appearances for the club.
Gallagher will start the 2012-13 season at the Melbourne Victory, having signed a pre-contract with the A-League club in March.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/new-face-for-victory-20120315-1v87h.html|title=New face for Victory|date=16 March 2012|publisher=The Age|accessdate=20 May 2012|location=Melbourne[/tpl] His debut with the Victory ended almost as soon as it began; in just the 16th minute of the Victory's Round 8 clash with the Western Sydney Wanderers at Parramatta Stadium, Gallagher was controversially sent off for bringing down Wanderers striker Dino Kresinger just outside the penalty area, denying the Croatian what was deemed an obvious goalscoring opportunity.http://www.sportal.com.au/football-news-display/victory-red-card-hampered-wanderers-210676http://www.mfootball.com.au/gallagher-to-miss-glory-clash/[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/football/ten-man-victory-beat-wanderers-2-0/story-fn63e0vj-1226523480500 | work=The Australian | title=Ten-man Victory beat Wanderers 2-0 | date=24 November 2012[/tpl]http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/gallagher-gets-one-week-ban/53950http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/aleague/matchcentre/matchreport/Western-Sydney-Wanderers-FC-v-Melbourne-Victory-FC-Hyundai-A-League/2645 This came despite the fact that Kresinger had clearly fouled Gallagher prior to Gallagher bringing him down. As a result of that red card, Gallagher was handed a one match ban, ruling him out of the Victory's clash with Perth Glory.
Gallagher made his second and final appearance with the Victory in their Round 10 clash with Adelaide United. Gallagher was handed a yellow card in the 79th minute of the match, a match which the Victory eventually lost 4-2.http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/match/stats/241667/Adelaide-United-vs-Melbourne-Victory/
Gallagher, along with teammates Diogo Ferreira, Spase Dilevski and Tando Velaphi were released by Melbourne Victory in April 2013, shortly after the end of the 2012-13 A-League season.http://www.melbournetimesweekly.com.au/story/1443848/ferreira-and-dilevski-among-four-cut-loose-by-victory/?cs=12 He left the club, having played just 2 games out of a possible 29 in his lone season with the club.

===Vietnam===

On 7 January 2014, after a successful trial period, Sam Gallagher signed with V-League Champions Hanoi T&T on a 1 year contract. He will play for Hanoi T&T in the 2014 V League and AFC Cup. The deal makes Sam the first Australian to play in both the Australian A-League and the Vietnamese V-League. He is hoped to be the replacement for Cristiano Roland, T&T's former captain and defender who retired after 2013 season. Gallagher said he knew about the pressure and hoped to do well replacing Cristiano.http://www.goal.com/vn/news/4879/b%C3%B3ng-%C4%91%C3%A1-vi%E1%BB%87t-nam/2014/01/13/4538409/gallagher-mu%E1%BB%91n-th%C3%A0nh-c%C3%B4ng-nh%C6%B0-c%E1%BB%B1u-%C4%91%E1%BB%99i-tr%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Fng-c%E1%BB%A7a-h%C3%A0-n%E1%BB%99i-tt
Gallagher made his debut in 11 January when he came from the bench in the match against Becamex Binh Duong, which T&T won 4-2. He played about 60 minutes and did well enough to earn the belief from club manager Phan Thanh HÃ¹ng.http://www.goal.com/vn/news/4879/b%C3%B3ng-%C4%91%C3%A1-vi%E1%BB%87t-nam/2014/01/11/4536374/hlv-phan-thanh-h%C3%B9ng-t%C3%B4i-%C4%91%C3%A3-c%C3%B3-l%E1%BA%A1i-ni%E1%BB%81m-tin-n%C6%A1i-h%C3%A0ng-th%E1%BB%A7 He got chosen to the starting XI for the first time a week later in V-League second round against Hoang Anh Gia Lai F.C. and continued to do well. He got his second full-start against Vissai Ninh Binh F.C. in 22 January and scored an own-goal as T&T lost 1-3 in Hang Day.
Four days after, Gallagher made his debut in the AFC Champions League as T&T played the first-round qualifier against Pune F.C. of India and scored a goal - his first goal ever for the Hanoian club.
