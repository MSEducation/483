==Album information==

Composed in between relentless touring in 2006, the album blends heavy rock ("Waiting" + "Until the next time"), alternative rock ("Basis of Everything", "Any Other Way") with more mainstream pop-indie ("Do You Realise", "Stop"). Written, played, and co-produced (with Engineer Gareth Mannix) by Níal, Ross, Ronan and Kier, the self-funded record was released on their own DeloRecords, and distributed by their managers label, Cottage Records. The album was recorded with Gareth Mannix in four week-long sessions between November 2006 and February 2007. Mannix had previously worked with Republic of Loose, The Chalets and The Blizzards.
To support the release, the track "Eustace Street" was released as a download on the same day. The next physical release was the single "Stop" in July 2007. It contained the tracks "Stop" (a remixed single version), "She's So Modern" and a remix of "Stop" by Irish V2 artist Jape called "Stop – What a Comedown".
