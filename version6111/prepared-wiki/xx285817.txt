Matthew Horton at the BBC had a less enthusiastic response, describing it as "turning a bluesy guitar over and over against sinister keys – no quick rewards here."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/z828 |title=Stereophonics Graffiti on the Train Review |last=Horton |first=Matthew |publisher=BBC |year=2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6K1Wy2HiJ |archivedate=30 September 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 August 2013[/tpl] At NME, Tom Howard had a negative response writing, "By slowly fading into the background of pop culture, the Stereophonics have created some space to pump out the same old stuff for their fans. So on ‘We Share The Same Sun’ Kelly Jones is gruff and there’s a big chorus, and the faithful will lap it up like hairy dogs with bowls of ice-cold water in hot weather."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/stereophonics/14655 |title=Stereophonics - 'We Share The Same Sun' |last=Howard |first=Tom |publisher=NME |date=2 August 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl]
