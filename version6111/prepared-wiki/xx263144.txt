Lecce railway station ([tpl]lang-it|Stazione di Lecce[/tpl]) [tpl]airport codes|LCZ[/tpl] serves the city and comune of Lecce, in the region of Apulia, southern Italy.  Opened in 1866, it is the southern terminus of the Adriatic Railway (Ancona–Lecce), and is also the terminus of two regional lines, the Martina Franca–Lecce railway and the Lecce–Otranto railway.
The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI).  However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni.  Train services on the Adriatic Railway are operated by or on behalf of Trenitalia.  Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company.
Services on the Martina Franca–Lecce railway and the Lecce–Otranto railway are operated by Ferrovie del Sud Est (FSE).

==History==

The station was opened on 15 January 1866, upon the inauguration of the final section of the Adriatic Railway, between Brindisi and Lecce.[tpl]cite web| author=Alessandro Tuzza and others| url=http://www.trenidicarta.it/aperture.html| title=Prospetto cronologico dei tratti di ferrovia aperti all'esercizio dal 1839 al 31 dicembre 1926| trans_title=Chronological overview of the features of the railways opened between 1839 and 31 December 1926|work=Trenidicarta.it |publisher=Alessandro Tuzza| accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl] [tpl]it icon[/tpl]  It remained a terminal station until 1 February 1868, when a new line was opened between Lecce and Zollino.  That line now forms part of the Lecce–Otranto railway.
From the date of its opening until the nationalisation of railways in Italy, the station was operated by the Società per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali ([tpl]lang-en|Company for the Southern Railways[/tpl], SFM).  It was then taken over by the FS.
On 27 May 1907, the station was linked with Francavilla Fontana, by a railway line built to the Italian narrow gauge of [tpl]convert|950|mm[/tpl].  This line later became the nucleus of the Martina Franca–Lecce railway, operated by the LSE.  Since 1933, the Lecce-Maglie-Otranto railway, which serves as an extension of the Adriatic Railway, has also been operated by the LSE.

==Train services==

Adriatic Railway mainline trains depart from Lecce with destinations including Bari, Rome, Milan, Bologna, Venice and Turin.
