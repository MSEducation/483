[tpl]Nihongo|Eiki Eiki|影木 栄貴||born December 6, 1971[/tpl] is a Japanese manga artist who has been creating manga since 1998. Most of her manga are written under the yaoi and yuri genre. One of her good friends, also a fellow manga artist, is Mikiyo Tsuda, otherwise known as Taishi Zaō. They often co-author manga together, display their art together, and have autograph sessions together, among other things. Eiki Eiki has even been known to sometimes act as Taishi Zaō's manager.Afterword section in the Digital Manga Publishing version of The Day of Revolution, volume 1 
Many manga artists often adopt artistic personas for themselves in order to represent themselves in sections of their manga not attributed to the story, as in an author's note section. Eiki Eiki's persona is that of a rabbit wearing a red bow tie. 
She is the grandchild of former Prime minister of Japan Noboru Takeshita and the older sister of rock singer Daigo.
