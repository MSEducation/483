[tpl]lang|grc|Ἀγίας[/tpl]), the son of Agelochus and grandson of Tisamenus of Elea, was the Spartan seer of Lysander, who predicted that general's victory at the battle of Aegospotami in 404 BC.[tpl]Cite book  | last = Smith  | first = William  | author-link = William Smith (lexicographer)  | contribution = Agias (1)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology  | volume = 1  | pages = 71  | publisher = Little, Brown and Company  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0080.html  | postscript =  [/tpl]  Some ancient writers considered Agias' prediction—that Lysander would capture the entire fleet except for ten triremes (which fled to Corcyra)--to have been the cause of the victory more than a mere prediction.[tpl]cite book  | last = Halliday  | first = W.
