[[Caecilia (gens)]]

CATEGORIES: Roman gentes, Caecilii

The gens Caecilia ([tpl]IPAc-en|k|aɪ|k|ɪ|l|i|ə[/tpl], [tpl]IPAc-en|s|iː|s|iː|l|i|ə[/tpl], or [tpl]IPAc-en|s|ɛ|s|ɪ|l|i|ə[/tpl]) was a plebeian family at Rome. Members of this gens are mentioned in history as early as the 5th century BC, but the first of the Caecilii who obtained the consulship was Lucius Caecilius Metellus Denter, in 284 BC.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. The appearance of Titus Caecilius, a patrician consular tribune for the year 444 BC in Livius, is a false reading for Titus Cloelius.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, iv. 7.

==Origin of the gens==

Like other Roman families in the later times of the Republic, the Caecilii traced their origin to a mythical personage, Caeculus, the founder of Praeneste. He was said to be the son of Vulcan, and engendered by a spark; a similar story was told of Servius Tullius. He was exposed as an infant, but preserved by his divine father, and raised by maidens. He grew up amongst the shepherds, and became a highwayman. Coming of age, he called upon the people of the countryside to build a new town, convincing them with the aid of a miracle. An alternative tradition claimed that the Caecilii were descended from Caecas, one of the companions of Aeneas, who came with him to Italy after the sack of Troy.Sextus Pompeius Festus, epitome of Marcus Verrius Flaccus, De Verborum Significatu, s. v.

==Praenomina used by the gens==

The praenomina used by the Caecilii during the Republic are Lucius, Quintus, Gaius, and Marcus. Titus appears only towards the very end of the Republic, and is not known to have been used by the great house of the Caecilii Metelli.

==Branches and cognomina of the gens==

The cognomina of this gens under the Republic are Bassus, Denter, Metellus, Niger, Pinna, and Rufus, of which the Metelli are the best known. From the consulship of Lucius Caecilius Metellus Denter, the family of the Metelli became one of the most distinguished at Rome. In the latter half of the 2nd century BC. it obtained an extraordinary number of the highest offices of the state. Quintus Metellus, who was consul in 143 BC, had four sons, who were raised to the consulship in succession; and his brother, Lucius Metellus, who was consul in 142, had two sons, who were likewise elevated to the same dignity.
The Metelli were distinguished as a family for their unwavering support of the party of the optimates. The etymology of their name is quite uncertain. Festus connects it, probably from mere similarity of sound, with mercenarii. The history of the family is very difficult to trace, and in many parts conjectural. It is treated at length by Drumann.Sextus Pompeius Festus, epitome of Marcus Verrius Flaccus De Verborum Significatu, p. 146, ed. Müller.Wilhelm Drumann, Geschichte Roms, ii. 17-58.
