Turku and Pori Province ([tpl]Lang-fi|Turun ja Porin lääni[/tpl], [tpl]Lang-sv|Åbo och Björneborgs län[/tpl]) was a province of independent Finland from 1917 to 1997. The province was however founded as a county in 1634 when today's Finland was an integrated part of Sweden. It is named after the cities of Turku ([tpl]Lang-sv|Åbo[/tpl]) and Pori ([tpl]Lang-sv|Björneborg[/tpl]).
The Åland Islands were split into a separate province in 1918. In 1997 Turku and Pori Province was merged with the northern part of the Häme Province, the provinces of Vaasa and Central Finland into the new Western Finland Province.
