Thorpe Arnold is a village in the English county of Leicestershire.  Situated on the top of a hill close to the town of Melton Mowbray, Thorpe Arnold is a small farming village with roots going back to before its first recorded mention in the Domesday Book of 1086. At this time, the village and surrounding lands were in the possession of Hugo de Gentlemaisnell, whose successors were the Earls of Leicester.[tpl]Fact|date=January 2008[/tpl] Thorpe (or Torp) was eventually settled on an Earl of Leicesterâ€™s steward named Ernauld de Bosco, four further generations of his family took the name Ernauld and this, it is widely believed, it how Thorpe Arnold got its name.[tpl]Fact|date=January 2008[/tpl]
Administratively it forms part of the civil parish of Waltham and Thorpe Arnold that, in turn, form part of the Borough of Melton.
