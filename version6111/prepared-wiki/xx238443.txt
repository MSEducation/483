The 2009-10 Major Indoor Soccer League is the sophomore season for the league, and first under the old MISL banner. 31 season of professional Division 1 indoor soccer. The members of the MISL's second season teams are the Baltimore Blast, the Milwaukee Wave, the Monterrey La Raza, the Philadelphia KiXX, and the Rockford Rampage.
The season kicked off on November 13, 2009 with the NISL Champion, Baltimore Blast, welcoming the Rockford Rampage. The regular season will conclude on March 21, 2010, with the Rockford Rampage hosting Monterrey La Raza.
This year also marks the first season since the KiXX founding that they will play at a new arena, the Liacouras Center, on the campus of Temple University.http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2009/10/12/daily36.html
Shortly before the season began, the league was re-branded as the Major Indoor Soccer League.
The season for each team has expanded to twenty games, so each team this year will play ten home and ten away games. However, due to arena conflicts with Temple University, the Kixx will play eight home games and twelve road games.
On March 9, 2010 with a 11-6 win over the Rockford Rampage, the Milwaukee Wave clinched the first playoff spot. This continues the Wave's tradition of making the playoffs every season in a league named MISL. This also marks the fifteenth season since the 1993-1994 NPSL for the Wave to qualify for the playoffs.
