[[Hooper Bay (album)]]

CATEGORIES: Boards of Canada albums, 1994 EPs

Hooper Bay was purportedly an EP created by Boards of Canada, issued in both vinyl  and cassette formats. The title refers to the small city of that name in Alaska, and all track titles on the album share a similar Alaskan theme.http://web.archive.org/web/20080117082017/http://fredd-e.narfum.org/boc/comments/#hooperbay Only 200 copies were purported to have been produced and none have publicly surfaced.
A small excerpt, about 35 seconds, of the track "Circle" was hosted on a website that held material relating to the group. The excerpt shows a melancholy kind of ambient music, similar to songs from Twoism. The site has since gone down, though the sample is currently available on YouTube.
Mislabeled mp3s claiming to be copies of Hooper Bay are in wide circulation on peer to peer networks, but are understood to be fakes. As with other rare Boards of Canada releases, some of these fakes are mostly mislabelled tracks by other musicians and bands. For example, "Geiser" is actually the experimental Icelandic group múm's "Smell Memory", and "Seaward Leaf" is actually "Slow Bicycle", another track by múm.
