==Belvedere Vodka "Date Rape" Controversy==

On 29 March 2012, Packard filed a lawsuit against Moët Hennessy, makers of Belvedere vodka for misappropriating her image by including it in an online ad campaign; the image was taken from a short online comedy video, "Awkward Moments: The Baby Picture," produced by Strickly Viral Productions.  In the context of the ad, the appropriated image depicts the character portrayed by Packard as trying to escape the clutches of what appears to be a sexually aggressive man; Belvedere added the tagline, "Unlike some people, Belvedere always goes down smoothly." Packard's filing also alleges negligent infliction of emotional distress, claiming that the repercussions of being associated with the ad "have been huge."[tpl]cite web|last=Newscore|title=Woman in controversial Belvedere Vodka "rape" ad files lawsuit|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/30/woman-in-controversial-belvedere-vodka-rape-ad-files-lawsuit/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=1 May 2012|date=30 March 2012[/tpl]   While the ad appeared only briefly on March 23 and was removed shortly thereafter, with Belvedere brand president Charles Gibb issuing a public apology subsequent to the ad's retraction, as of the lawsuit's filing, neither the brand nor the parent company had offered an apology to Packard for either the misappropriation or any of the subsequent negative fallout.[tpl]cite web|last=Gardner|first=Eriq|title=Actress Sues Over Controversial Vodka 'Rape' Advertisement|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/lawsuit-actress-sues-vodka-belvedere-rape-306435|work=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=1 May 2012|date=30 March 2012[/tpl] Packard's lawsuit was filed under California Civil Code § 3344, the so-called California Celebrities Rights Act of 1985, which prohibits unauthorized use of personal images or likenesses for promotional purposes.[tpl]cite web|last=Seccaspina|first=Linda|title=Creepy Belvedere Vodka's Rape Ad Goes Limp Fast|url=http://linda-seccaspina.newsvine.com/_news/2012/04/06/11047049-creepy-belvedere-vodkas-rape-ad-goes-limp-fast|publisher=newsvine.com|accessdate=1 May 2012|date=6 April 2012[/tpl]
