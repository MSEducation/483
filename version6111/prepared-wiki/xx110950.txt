In June 2010, a letter outlining the University of California libraries' pricing challenges with NPG was distributed to university faculty by campus librarians with the support of the systemwide University Committee on Library and Scholarly Communication. The letter also described a potential boycott if the dispute was not resolved.[tpl]cite news |url=http://chronicle.com/article/U-of-California-Tries-Just/65823/ |title=U. of California Tries Just Saying No to Rising Journal Costs |work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=2010-06-08 |accessdate=2010-06-09 |last=Howard |first=Jennifer [/tpl] In August 2010, a joint statement was released stating "Our two organizations have agreed to work together in the coming months to address our mutual short- and long-term challenges, including an exploration of potential new approaches and evolving publishing models."Statement from the University of California and Nature Publishing Group, 25 August 2010 retrieved on 15 March 2011
