[[Wall unit]]

CATEGORIES: Furniture, Interior design

A wall unit is a premanufactured furnishing that has become very popular the past 25 years. It is an assembly of several discrete components that are usually fixed to an internal wall of a room. Wall unit fixtures are usually customised per installation and range in style from contemporary to traditional in order to match the decore of the home or business establishment in which they are installed.
Wall units are often made from oak, maple, yellow cedar, paduk wood, American and European beech, purple heart wood, alder and cherry. Some companies combine solid and wood veneers or use MDF or particle board to create wall units that normally have amendable shelves. But aside from using wood, metal and glass can also be employed in their manufacture. Wall units are convenient for builders in that they can be easily installed. This kind of furniture can be utilised as storage, provide a surface for food preparation or to house whitegoods in kitchens, as entertainment centres for television or audio equipment or have many other household or office uses.
