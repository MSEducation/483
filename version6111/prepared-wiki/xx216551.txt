[[Percutaneous nephrostomy]]

CATEGORIES: Nephrology

Percutaneous nephrostomy is an interventional radiology/surgical procedure in which the renal pelvis is punctured whilst using imaging as guidance. Images are obtained once an antegrade pyelogram (an injection of contrast), with a fine needle, has been performed. This contrast is used to show calcifications at the renal pelvis. A nephrostomy tube may then be placed to allow drainage.[tpl]cite book | last=Longmore | first=Murray | coauthors=Ian Wilkinson, Tom Turmezei, Chee Kay Cheung | title=Oxford Handbook of Clinicial Medicine, 7th edition | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2007 | pages=731 | isbn=0-19-856837-1 [/tpl]
