[[Clasper]]

CATEGORIES: Fish anatomy, Insect anatomy, Reproduction in animals

In biology, a clasper is a male anatomical structure found in some groups of animals, used in mating.
Male cartilaginous fish have claspers formed from the posterior portion of their pelvic fin which serve as intromittent organs used to channel semen into the female's cloaca during mating. The act of mating in some fish including sharks usually includes one of the claspers raised to allow water into the siphon through a specific orifice.  The clasper is then inserted into the cloaca, where it opens like an umbrella to anchor its position. The siphon then begins to contract expelling water and sperm.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=clasper&language=english&sc=is |title=System glossary |work=FishBase |accessdate=2013-02-15[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The Timetree of Life: Cartilaginous Fishes (Chondrichthyes) |last=Heinicke |first=Matthew P. |last2=Naylor |first2=Gavin J.

In entomology, it is a structure in male insects that is used to hold the female during copulation.
