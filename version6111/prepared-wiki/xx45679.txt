CATEGORIES: Municipalities of Limburg (Belgium)

Tessenderlo is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Limburg. It is where the three Belgian provinces of Limburg, Flemish Brabant and Antwerp meet at the front gate of the Averbode Abbey. The municipality Tessenderlo encompasses the villages of Tessenderlo proper, Schoot, Engsbergen, Hulst and Berg. It is on the Albert Canal and the European route E313, the highway between Antwerp and Liège, one of the reasons why it was the place for the first Belgian "Industrial Zone of National Importance" in the 1960s.
Tessenderlo was the scene of an infamous industrial disaster during WWII, when a stock of 150 tonnes of ammonium nitrate at the chemical plant of "Produits Chimiques de Tessenderloo" (now "Tessenderlo Chemie") - located near the centre of town - exploded on April 29, 1942, killing 189 people at the plant and in the town.
Tessenderlo is part of a small western zone of Limburg where the local dialect is not the Limburgian dialect, but Brabantic.
On January 1, 2006 Tessenderlo had a total population of 16,811. The total area is 51.35 km² which gives a population density of 327 inhabitants per km².
