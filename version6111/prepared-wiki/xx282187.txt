While booking events throughout Manitoba, Condello worked alongside many future stars, such as Ron Ritchie, Kerry Brown, & Buddy Lane. 
Condello's greatest success came in 1986, when he struck a deal with Eddie Sharkey's Pro Wrestling America promotion, which would include a talent exchange and dual promotion.
