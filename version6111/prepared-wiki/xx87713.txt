In 1968 the side platform was converted to an island platform as part of the duplication of the line to Werribee. It was upgraded to a Premium station in 1998.[tpl]cite journal|date=October 1997|title=Upgrading Eltham to a Premium Station|journal=Newsrail|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society|pages=page 310[/tpl]
