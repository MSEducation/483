==Biography==

Ranaldo was born in Glen Cove, Long Island, studied art and graduated from Binghamton University. He has three sons, Cody, Sage and Frey, and is married to the experimental artist Leah Singer.
Ranaldo started his career in New York in several bands, and joined the electric guitar orchestra of Glenn Branca. In 1981, he and David Linton briefly joined the band Plus Instruments formed by Truus de Groot. With this line-up they recorded the album February - April 1981, released on the Dutch Kremlin label.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tikibosko.com/pi/chron.html |title=Official Website for Plus Instruments |publisher=Tikibosko.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11[/tpl] After the release of the album, Ranaldo left the band and started Sonic Youth with Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon. 

==Solo Records==

In 1987, Ranaldo released his first solo album, From Here to Infinity, compositions which ended in locked grooves.  The second side of the album also featured an unplayable engraving by Savage Pencil.
Among Ranaldo's solo records are Dirty Windows, a collection of spoken texts with music, Amarillo Ramp (For Robert Smithson), pieces for the guitar, and Scriptures of the Golden Eternity. His books include several with art or photography by Leah Singer, including Drift, Bookstore, Road Movies, and Moroccan Journal: Jajouka excerpt (from a full-length book of writings on Moroccan travels and music).  Ranaldo has also published Jrnls80s (published by Soft Skull Press), as well as a book of poems, Lengths & Breaths, with photography by Cynthia Connolly. His most recent book of poetry, Against Refusing, was published by Water Row Press in April 2010 with cover artwork by Leah Singer. His visual and sound works have been shown at galleries and museums in Paris, Toronto, New York, London, Sydney, Los Angeles, Vienna, and elsewhere.
After Sonic Youth went on hiatus in 2011, Ranaldo released Between the Times and the Tides in early 2012 on Matador Records.  The record was the first under his own name to feature comparatively straightforward, vocal pop rock songs.  Contributors to the record include Jim O'Rourke, Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley, former Sonic Youth drummer Bob Bert, Wilco's Nels Cline, Alan Licht, John Medeski, and bassist Irwin Menken.
To tour for the album, Ranaldo organized The Dust as his formal group, featuring Licht, Shelley, and bassist Tim Lüntzel.  In 2013, his follow-up album Last Night on Earth was released, credited to Lee Ranaldo and the Dust.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.themorningsun.com/arts-and-entertainment/20131010/sound-check-lee-ranaldo-and-the-dust-working-as-a-unit |title=Sound Check: Lee Ranaldo and the Dust working as a unit |publisher=Themorningsun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=By Mike Ayers |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lee-ranaldo-explores-distress-on-ambulancer-song-premiere-20130927 |title=Lee Ranaldo and the Dust Release New Track 'Ambulancer' | Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-10-11[/tpl]

Drift is a duo with his wife Leah Singer, with whom he has performed many live installation pieces with improvised music.  This collaboration, utilizing live manipulated 16mm film projections, electric guitar and recited texts, occupied the duo from the early 1990s until late 2005, when they re-created the performance as an art installation at Gigantic Art Space, a gallery in New York City.  Since then the pair have been performing a new piece entitled "iloveyouihateyou", a combination installation and performance work that has been presented in the US and Europe. In 2005 Drift released a box set with a DVD and a book.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Drift-Art-Book-Lee-Ranaldo/dp/B000B7VZGK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1319588284&sr=8-1|title=Drift (w/ Art Book): Lee Ranaldo, Leah Singer: Movies & TV|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=August 28, 2012[/tpl]

==Equipment==

Ranaldo usually uses Fender Jazzmaster, Telecaster Deluxe electric guitars and sometimes Gibson Les Pauls, with radically alternative tunings, and modifications. One of his Jazzmasters has a single coil pickup installed between the bridge and the tailpiece to exploit the resonating chiming sounds on that area of string at these so-called tailed bridge guitars.
In 2007 Yuri Landman built for Ranaldo the Moonlander, a biheaded electric guitar with 18 strings: 6 normal strings and 12 sympathetic strings.
Since Ranaldo and Moore, together with Elvis Costello and J. Mascis, are known for being key figures in the popularisation and resurrection of the Fender Jazzmaster, Fender introduced in 2009 a special Lee Ranaldo signature edition of a transparent blue version, together with a transparent green one for Thurston.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fender.com/sonicyouth/|title=Fender® Sonic Jazz Master Jazz Blaster|publisher=Fender|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100527211417/http://www.fender.com/sonicyouth/|archivedate=May 27, 2010|accessdate=June 14, 2009[/tpl]
In 2013, Ranaldo played a Watcher guitar from the French company Custom77 during his last Lee Ranaldo & The Dust tour throughout Europe.http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/interview-lee-ranaldo-talks-gear-guitars-and-shops/018413?fb_action_ids=10203113669870427&fb_action_types=og.likes&fb_source=other_multiline&action_object_map=%5B1407029756208963%5D&action_type_map=%5B%22og.likes%22%5D&action_ref_map
