After the song's success, The J.B.'s recorded an answer song, "Pick Up the Pieces One By One". The single was credited to "A.A.B.B", or "Above Average Black Band." Reportedly, the primary motivation for the answer song was the appropriation of the bass line to James Brown's "Hot Pants Road."http://funky16corners.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/aabb-pick-up-the-pieces-one-by-one/
It is heard in a 2013 TV commercial for Bank of America.
In Movies, the song was heard during the bar fight scene in Superman II (1980). In 1999, was used in "Bowfinger", in 2004 in the US version of "Taxi" and in 2010, was used on "Iron Man 2". As a curious fact, "Bowfinger", featured Robert Downey Jr. and Terence Stamp, stars of "Iron Man 2" and "Superman II", both sequels of Superheroes movies from rival companies (DC Comics and Marvel Comics) and both featured the theme in scenes featuring the villains of the films.
