[[Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II]]

CATEGORIES: Romanization of Chinese

Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II (國語注音符號第二式), abbreviated MPS II, is a romanization system formerly used in the  Republic of China (Taiwan).  It was  created to replace the complex tonal-spelling Gwoyeu Romatzyh, and to co-exist with the popular Wade-Giles (romanization) and Zhuyin (non-romanization).  It is sometimes referred to as Gwoyeu Romatzyh 2 or GR2.

==History==

Based on the earlier and more complex Gwoyeu Romatzyh, the tentative version of MPS II was released on May 10, 1984, by the Ministry of Education. After two years of feedback from the general public, the official version was established on January 28, 1986.[tpl]cite news |publisher=Pinyin Info |date=March 10, 2004 |title=MPS2 |url=http://www.pinyin.info/romanization/mps2/[/tpl] To distinguish Zhuyin from the Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II ("Mandarin Zhuyin Symbols II"), the first Zhuyin is officially called "Mandarin Phonetic Symbols I" (國語注音符號第一式).
Despite its official status for almost two decades until it was replaced by Tongyong Pinyin in 2002, MPS II existed only in some governmental publications (such as travel brochures and dictionaries). However, MPS II was not used for the official Romanized names of Taiwanese places (though many road signs replaced during this period uses MPS II). It never gained the same status as did Wade-Giles. In mainstream overseas communities, it is virtually unused and unheard of.

An example of MPS II: "國語注音符號第二式" is written as guó-yǔ jù-yīn fú-hàu dì-èr shr̀. Compare with pinyin, which writes it as guóyǔ zhùyīn fúhào dì'èr shì and to GR, which writes it as gwoyeu juh'in fwuhaw dih'ell shyh.
Spaces are generally used in place of hyphens, except in personal names, which use hyphens in between the syllables of the given names.
