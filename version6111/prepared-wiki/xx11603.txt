CATEGORIES: Time and fate goddesses, Norse goddesses

In Norse mythology, Verðandi (Old Norse, meaning possibly "happening" or "present"Orchard (1997:174).), sometimes anglicized as Verdandi or Verthandi, is one of the norns. Along with Urðr (Old Norse "fate"Orchard (1997:169).) and Skuld (possibly "debt" or "future"Orchard (1997:151).), Verðandi makes up a trio of Norns that are described as deciding the fates (wyrd) of people.

Verðandi is literally the present tense of the Old Norse verb "verða", "to become", and is commonly translated as "in the making" or "that which is happening/becoming"; it is related to the Dutch word worden and the German word werden, both meaning "to become".[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]

In the manga and anime series Oh My Goddess!, the character Belldandy is an interpretation of Verthandi.
