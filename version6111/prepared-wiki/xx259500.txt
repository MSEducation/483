Pamela Faber is best known for her works on the Functional Lexematic Model and her cognitive theory of Terminology called Frame-Based Terminology.

===Functional Lexematic Model===

Frame-Based Terminology focuses on:
Within this context, Faber's current major project is called EcoLexicon, a terminological knowledge base on the Environment.
