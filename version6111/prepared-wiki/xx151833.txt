The band recorded only one album and charted two singles, "Walkin' the Country" and "Just Some Love," on the country charts before disbanding in 1998. Besides its two singles, The Ranch included a song entitled "Some Days You Gotta Dance", which was later released as a single by the Dixie Chicks from their 1999 album Fly, and which also featured Urban on guitar. Urban later started a solo career on Capitol Records. Due to Urban's solo success, The Ranch's album was re-issued in 2004 on Capitol/EMI as Keith Urban in The Ranch with the added inclusion of two bonus tracks.
