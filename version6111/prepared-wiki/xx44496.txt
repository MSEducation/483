[[Equilateral triangle]]

CATEGORIES: Triangles, Triangle geometry

In geometry, an equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. In traditional or Euclidean geometry, equilateral triangles are also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60°. They are regular polygons, and can therefore also be referred to as regular triangles.

==Principal properties==

Assuming the lengths of the sides of the equilateral triangle are a, we can determine using the Pythagorean theorem that: 

Many of these quantities have simple relationships to the altitude ("h") of each vertex from the opposite side:

In an equilateral triangle, the altitudes, the angle bisectors, the perpendicular bisectors and the medians to each side coincide.

==Characterizations==

A triangle ABC that has the sides a, b, c, semiperimeter s, area T, exradii ra, rb, rc (tangent to a, b, c respectively), and where R and r are the radii of the circumcircle and incircle respectively, is equilateral if and only if any one of the statements in the following eight categories is true. These are also properties of an equilateral triangle.

===Equal cevians===

Three kinds of cevians are equal for (and only for) equilateral triangles:Byer, Owen; Lazebnik, Felix and Smeltzer, Deirdre, Methods for Euclidean Geometry, Mathematical Association of America, 2010, pp. 36, 39.

===Coincident triangle centers===

Every triangle center of an equilateral triangle coincides with its centroid, and for some pairs of triangle centers, the fact that they coincide is enough to ensure that the triangle is equilateral. In particular, a triangle is equilateral if any two of the circumcenter, incenter, centroid, or orthocenter coincide.Yiu, Paul, Notes on Euclidean Geometry, 1998, p. 37, http://www.math.fau.edu/Yiu/EuclideanGeomeryNotes.pdf It is also equilateral if its circumcenter coincides with the Nagel point, or if its incenter coincides with its nine-point center.Andreescu, Titu and Andrica, Dorian, "Complex Numbers from A to...Z", Birkhäuser, 2006, pp. 70, 113-115.

===Six triangles formed by partitioning by the medians===

For any triangle, the three medians partition the triangle into six smaller triangles.

==Famous theorems==

Morley's trisector theorem states that, in any triangle, the three points of intersection of the adjacent angle trisectors form an equilateral triangle.
Napoleon's theorem states that, if equilateral triangles are constructed on the sides of any triangle, either all outward, or all inward, the centers of those equilateral triangles themselves form an equilateral triangle.
A version of the isoperimetric inequality for triangles states that the triangle of greatest area among all those with a given perimeter is equilateral.
Viviani's theorem states that, for any interior point P in an equilateral triangle, with distances d, e, and f from the sides, d + e + f = the altitude of the triangle, independent of the location of P.Posamentier, Alfred S., and Salkind, Charles T., Challenging Problems in Geometry, Dover Publ., 1996.
Pompeiu's theorem states that, if P is an arbitrary point in an equilateral triangle ABC, then there exists a triangle with sides of length PA, PB, and PC.

==Other properties==

By Euler's inequality, the equilateral triangle has the smallest ratio R/r of the circumradius to the inradius of any triangle: specifically, R/r = 2.
The triangle of largest area of all those inscribed in a given circle is equilateral; and the triangle of smallest area of all those circumscribed around a given circle is equilateral.Dorrie, Heinrich, 100 Great Problems of Elementary Mathematics, Dover Publ., 1965: 379-380.
Given a point in the interior of an equilateral triangle, the ratio of the sum of its distances from the vertices to the sum of its distances from the sides equals 2 and is less than that of any other triangle.Lee, Hojoo, "Another proof of the Erdős–Mordell Theorem", Forum Geometricorum 1, 2001: 7-8. This is the Erdős–Mordell inequality; a stronger variant of it is Barrow's inequality, which replaces the perpendicular distances to the sides with the distances to the points where the angle bisectors cross the sides.

An equilateral triangle is the most symmetrical triangle, having 3 lines of reflection and rotational symmetry of order 3 about its center. Its symmetry group is the dihedral group of order 6 D3.
Equilateral triangles are the only triangles whose Steiner inellipse is a circle (specifically, it is the incircle).
Equilateral triangles are found in many other geometric constructs. The intersection of circles whose centers are a radius width apart is a pair of equilateral arches, each of which can be inscribed with an equilateral triangle. They form faces of regular and uniform polyhedra. Three of the five Platonic solids are composed of equilateral triangles. In particular, the regular tetrahedron has four equilateral triangles for faces and can be considered the three-dimensional analogue of the shape. The plane can be tiled using equilateral triangles giving the triangular tiling.

==Geometric construction==

An equilateral triangle is easily constructed using a compass and straightedge. Draw a straight line, and place the point of the compass on one end of the line, and swing an arc from that point to the other point of the line segment. Repeat with the other side of the line. Finally, connect the point where the two arcs intersect with each end of the line segment
Alternate method:
Draw a circle with radius r, place the point of the compass on the circle and draw another circle with the same radius. The two circles will intersect in two points. An equilateral triangle can be constructed by taking the two centers of the circles and either of the points of intersection.
The proof that the resulting figure is an equilateral triangle is the first proposition in Book I of Euclid's Elements.

==In culture and society==

Equilateral triangles have frequently appeared in man made constructions:

==Derivation of area formula==

===Using the Pythagorean theorem===

The area of a triangle is half the base a times the height h,
The legs of the right triangle are half of the base and the height, while the hypotenuse is the side or base of the equilateral triangle. The height of an equilateral triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem
The equation can be rearranged to find the square of the height
The height is the square root of the equation. Thus

===Using trigonometry===

Using trigonometry, the area of a triangle with any two sides a and b, and an angle C between them is
Each angle of an equilateral triangle is 60°, so
since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal.
