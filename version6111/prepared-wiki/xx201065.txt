 Packera plattensis, also known as prairie ragwort or prairie groundsel is a species of the genus Packera and family Asteraceae.  It used to be a Senecio.
Prairie Groundsel is found throughout the tallgrass prairie region, and it is one of the earliest flowering prairie wildflowers.  It is easily confused with golden ragwort or Packera aurea which has a hairless stem and heart-shaped basal leaves, and Senecio integerrimus, which has leaves that are mostly entire instead of fern-like, and much larger basal leaves.Sylvan T. Runkel and Dean M. Roosa, Wildflowers of the Tallgrass Prairie: the upper Midwest, Iowa State University Press, 1989.  Page 73.
