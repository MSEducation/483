[[June Gap]]

CATEGORIES: Beekeeping in the United Kingdom

The June Gap refers to a dearth of nectar forage for bees in June in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The June Gap is important because typically, the number of bees and hence energy requirement in the colony has built up significantly by the time the dearth occurs.
Some plants which can help provide nectar in this gap are Cotoneaster and the closely related Pyracantha.
