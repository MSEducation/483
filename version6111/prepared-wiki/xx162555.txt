 but he did not have an immortal physical body like God the Father until [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|his resurrection]].
Ether 3:14–17.
While these spirit bodies are also composed of matter, they are described as being "more fine or pure" than regular matter.Doctrine and Covenants 131:7–8.

===Council in Heaven===

God the Father's plan for all his children was to provide a way for them to become more like him. Although they were happy living in heaven with God the Father, God's spirit children could not experience the "fulness of joy" enjoyed by him unless their spirit bodies were joined with a physical body.Doctrine and Covenants 93:33–34. God the Father convened a "Grand Council" of all his children to propose a plan of progression, known to Latter-day Saints as the plan of salvation.Joseph Smith (Joseph Fielding Smith ed.). Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) p. 348–349, 365. According to the proposed plan, God would provide an earth where spirit children could receive a physical body of flesh and blood.
One of the purposes of this earthly existence is for each of God's children to demonstrate through free will the desire to choose righteousness rather than evil. To facilitate free will decision-making, God would cause each spirit child to have no memory of their pre-earth life. All would be given trials and would fall short of perfection, but a Savior would be provided, the acceptance of whom would lead ultimately to redemption and a return to live with God the Father forever. Jehovah volunteered to be the SaviorAbraham 3:27.[tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|2009|pp=13–16[/tpl]. and said, "Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever."Moses 4:2. Jehovah was "the only person who could be the Savior".

===War in Heaven===

Lucifer, another of the spirit sons of God the Father, also sought to be the chosen Savior; however, he proposed that the free agency of humankind be abrogated so that "all mankind" would be redeemed through compelled obedience.Moses 4:1, 3–4. Additionally, Lucifer proposed that all glory and honor (and consequently power)D&C 29:36–38. be transferred from God the Father to himself. Lucifer's plan was rejected by God the Father, which caused Lucifer to be enraged and to try to overthrow God.
The War in Heaven ensued whereby Lucifer and his followers fought against Jehovah and his followers. One-third of the spirit children of God chose to follow Lucifer. Lucifer and his followers were cast out of heaven by God the Father. Because of their rebellion, Lucifer and the spirits who followed him would not receive a physical body as planned for in the plan of salvation. Lucifer is also known as Satan or the Devil. Satan and his spirit followers tempt people to make evil choices.

==Temporal creation and fall==

Following the War in Heaven, God the Father created the earth. Since all matter is co-eternal with God, creation of the earth was not performed ex nihilo. Rather, God performed creation by organizing pre-existing matter.Stephen E. Robinson. "LDS Differences in Doctrine". The earth and everything on it were created spiritually by God before they were created physically.Moses 3:5. Under the direction of God the Father, Jehovah used the priesthood to create the physical earth and everything in it as well as the sun, moon, stars, and planets.[tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|2009|pp=23–26[/tpl]. Jehovah had assistance from other children of God, including the archangel Michael. God the Father and Jehovah together created the physical bodies of Adam and Eve, which were patterned after the physical body possessed by God. Michael's spirit was placed in the male body, and a spirit daughter of God was placed in the female body.
Adam and Eve were placed in the Garden of Eden. Although they had physical bodies, they were not yet mortal.[tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|2009|pp=27–30[/tpl]. God the Father commanded them to have children. He also told them that they could eat of any tree in the garden except for the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and that they would "surely die" if they ate of that tree.Moses 3:16–17.
Satan tempted Adam and Eve to partake of the forbidden fruit. Eve yielded to temptation and ate the fruit; when she told Adam that she had eaten the fruit, Adam chose to eat also. As a result of their decision to eat the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve underwent the "fall". As God had promised, the bodies of Adam and Eve became mortal and they became subject to physical death, as well as sickness and pain. They also underwent "spiritual death": they were cast out of the Garden of Eden and separated from the presence of God. Due to the fall, Adam and Eve also came to know the difference between good and evil and became capable of having children, as God had originally commanded.
As a direct result of the fall of Adam and Eve, all children of God who would be born into the world suffer physical death and spiritual death.[tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|2009|pp=59–66[/tpl]. While physical death is the separation of the spirit from the body, spiritual death is the separation of a person from God. Spiritual death results from making sinful decisions between good and evil. Were it not for the atonement of Jesus Christ, physical death and spiritual death would both prevent God's children from returning to him with a physical body.
Unlike some Christians, Latter-day Saints generally do not see the fall as a serious sin or as an overwhelmingly negative event. Rather, the fall is viewed as "a necessary step in the plan of life and a great blessing to all of us. Because of the Fall, we are blessed with physical bodies, the right to choose between good and evil, and the opportunity to gain eternal life. None of these privileges would have been ours had Adam and Eve remained in the garden." Latter-day scripture reports that Adam and Eve later rejoiced that they had chosen to partake of the fruit,Moses 5:11. and the Book of Mormon teaches that the fall was necessary for humankind to exist and for them to experience joy, which is the ultimate purpose of existence.2 Nephi 2:22–25.

==The afterlife==

===Spirit world===

If a person physically dies without being given the chance to accept the atonement of Jesus Christ on the earth, he or she will be given that chance as a spirit after death.[tpl]harv|LDS Church|2009|pp=241–244[/tpl]. Necessary ordinances, such as baptism, can be vicariously performed on behalf of the person in LDS Church temples.

===Resurrection===

Mormons believe that Jesus made possible the literal resurrection of all humanity.  They teach that when Jesus physically died on the cross, Jesus' suffering ended and his spirit left his physical body.Mark 15:37.
On the third day after his death, Jesus' spirit returned to his physical body and he became the first child of God to be resurrected with a perfect and immortal physical body of flesh and bone. Because Jesus was resurrected, all children of God who ever lived on the earth will one day be resurrected.1 Corinthians 15:21–22.Alma 11:44. Thus, the spirit children of God will all receive immortal physical bodies of flesh and bone, and their spirits and their bodies will never again be separated.Alma 11:45.

===Degrees of glory===

In Mormon cosmology, there are three degrees of glory (alternatively, kingdoms of glory) which are the ultimate, eternal dwelling place for nearly all who lived on earth.  Joseph Smith, Jr., the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, provided a description of the afterlife based primarily upon a vision he reportedly received together with Sidney Rigdon, at Hiram, Ohio, February 16, 1832, and recorded as Doctrine and Covenants Section 76. According to this section of LDS scripture, the afterlife consists of three degrees or kingdoms of glory, called the Celestial Kingdom, the Terrestrial Kingdom, and the Telestial Kingdom.  The few who do not inherit any degree of glory (though they are resurrected) reside in a state called outer darkness, which, though not a degree of glory, is often discussed in this context. The ones who go there are known as "sons of perdition".

===Exaltation===

In consequence of the atonement of Jesus Christ, a son or daughter of God the Father may overcome physical and spiritual death and return to live with God forever. Those individuals who receive this—which is described as the "greatest gift of God"—are said to enter into a state of "exaltation" after they are resurrected.[tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|2009|pp=275–280[/tpl]. Exaltation is also called "salvation" or "eternal life", though some sources state that "salvation" refers only to the process of souls being freed from the bonds of Hell (also called "Spirit Prison"), or released from Paradise (also called "Spirit Paradise"), and the subsequent resurrection of said souls; while "exaltation" and "eternal life" refer to the state of living with God the Father and Jesus Christ in the "highest degree" of Heaven.Moses 1:39.
Exaltation is "the kind of life God lives". In other words, exalted beings will live in great glory, be perfect, and possess all knowledge and wisdom. Exalted beings will live forever with God the Father and Jesus Christ, will become gods and goddesses, will live with their righteous earthly family members, and will receive the fulness of joy enjoyed by God and Christ. One of they key qualifications for exaltation is being united in a celestial marriage to an opposite-sex partner.[tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|2009|pp=219–224[/tpl]. Such a union can be created during mortality, or it can be created after death by proxy marriages performed in temples.
Humans who fall short of exaltation still receive an immortal physical body. Most will be awarded one of three kingdoms of glory, whether it be the celestial, terrestrial, or telestial kingdoms.[tpl]harvtxt|LDS Church|2009|pp=269–274[/tpl]. Those who are exalted are said to inhabit the "highest degree" of the celestial kingdom.Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4. Satan, his spirit followers, and a select number of people who lived on the earth will receive no glory and will be called the sons of perdition.
