Living in New York City in the early 1870s, Rice was employed as a clerk with the Cunard Steamship Company when he saw the English production of The Black Crook and became interested in the idea of creating an American musical.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.edmund-rice.org/newsletters/num_30_1975_summer.pdf |title= Edward Everett Rice | publisher= p.9 Edmund Rice Newsletter, Summer 1975, Edmund Rice (1638) Association |accessdate=7 December 2013[/tpl]  In 1874 Rice and J. Cheever Goodwin were the creators of an extravaganza, Evangeline; or, The Belle of Acadia, a musical burlesque of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Evangeline, that became the first American production billed as a musical comedy.Chase, p. 362Green, Kay (ed.) "Evangeline", Broadway Musicals, Show by Show, Hal Leonard Corporation (1996) ISBN 0793577500 Rice composed the music for more than eighteen productions that appeared on Broadway, including Hiawatha and Summer Nights, that toured the country. Rice had no formal musical education and he could not read sheet music, but he had considerable raw talent playing by ear on the piano.  His method of composition would be to "dictate" to a scribe tunes that he would play on the piano, and he would make suggestions for orchestration.
As a producer, Rice introduced popular performers Pauline Hall, Lillian Russell, and Fay Templeton, and in 1898, he booked Clorindy, or The Origin of the Cake Walk by Will Marion Cook and Paul Laurence Dunbar, one of the earliest musicals by African Americans and the first to appear on Broadway at the prestigious Casino Theatre.Woll, Allen (1989).

Rice's biggest hit was 1894's Adonis, which starred Henry Dixey, one of the most popular performers of the era.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.musicals101.com/who7b.htm | title=Edward E.
