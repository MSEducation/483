In February 1993, Bass reported to police that Haim had threatened him during an argument, and Haim was arrested. According to Haim's publicist at the time, he was shooting BB guns at a target in his backyard while trying to fire Bass, who refused to accept that he was being let go. Initially investigated as a terrorist threat (a felony), Haim's charge was downgraded to the misdemeanor of exhibiting a replica handgun in a threatening manner.

In 1993, Haim starred in a full motion video game called Double Switch, which was released for the Sega CD and later for the Sega Saturn, as well as for the home computer.
In 1994, Haim visited Mannheim, Germany to sign a deal with the German record label Edel, and recorded an album there. However, the deal fell through and the album remained unreleased. One of the songs, the euro-house influenced "You Give Me Everything", produced by Daniel Schubert and Daniel Gonschorek, was released in 1995 as a 4-track single.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.discogs.com/Corey-Haim-You-Give-Me-Everything/release/2139871 |title=Corey Haim: You Give Me Everything |publisher=Discogs.com |accessdate=November 27, 2010 | location=London[/tpl]
Over the next two years, Haim released sequels to two of his older films, 1994's Fast Getaway II along with National Lampoon's Last Resort, 1995's Life 101, and another sequel, Dream a Little Dream 2, alongside Feldman. In 1995, Haim also unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Robin in Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever.

In 1996, Haim starred in four more direct-to-video films with Feldman—Snowboard Academy, Demolition High, Fever Lake and Busted—who also directed. Feldman was forced to fire Haim after he refused to curtail his drug use and was inconsistent on set, later saying that it was one of the hardest things he ever had to do.[tpl]cite web |title=Corey Feldman on Befriending Pink Floyd, Lost Boys: The Tribe, and Surviving Corey Haim |url=http://www.pr.com/article/1101 |first=Allison |last=Kugel |authorlink=Allison Kugel|publisher=PR.com |date=June 16, 2008|accessdate=July 20, 2010[/tpl] Haim then had a minor role in the television film Merlin: The Quest Begins.

Haim nearly went broke after he pulled out of the film Paradise Bar in 1996. He was sued by Lloyds of London for $375,000 for failing to disclose his drug addiction as a pre-existing medical condition on the insurance form. Haim filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 1997.[tpl]cite web|title=Corey Haim: A Timeline Of The Late Actor's Career |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1633601/20100310/story.jhtml |publisher=MTV |date=March 10, 2010 |first=Josh |last=Wigler|accessdate=March 10, 2010[/tpl] According to the bankruptcy report, he owed $100,000 to the IRS, and had $100,000 in outstanding debts.

In 1999, Haim shot a troubled low-budget independent film called Universal Groove in Montreal, using then-emerging digital technology.[tpl]cite web |title=Corey! Corey!

Haim's return to Canada was newsworthy, with the shoot garnering local press interest and reporters from People visiting the set. However, the film experienced fatal post-production problems, and stolen footage was leaked on the internet. Over eight years later, the filmmakers finally self-released a reconstructed version of the film online.[tpl]cite web |title=Universal Groove Starring Lost Boy Corey Haim Releasing |url=http://www.1888pressrelease.com/universal-groove-starring-lost-boy-corey-haim-releasing-pr-109cdq2b1.html |work=1888PressRelease.com | date=March 8, 2007| accessdate=February 25, 2011[/tpl]

===Early 2000s===

Haim attempted to return to the industry in 2000 with the direct-to-video thriller, Without Malice, with Jennifer Beals and Craig Sheffer. He hoped that playing the role of an ex-addict who conceals a murder with his sister's fiance would offer him a transition from teen fare. The film lensed in Waskesiu, Saskatchewan, where crew members recalled Haim's propping up the town's only bar until the early hours. Haim would reportedly halt production to call Toronto and check if his dog was dead, and sudden medical incidents required the filling of emergency prescriptions.[tpl]cite web |title=From Lost to Lucky: Corey Haim makes a comeback |url=http://www.carillon.uregina.ca/00.03.02/arts/haim.html |first=Cabral |last=Rock |publisher=The Carillon |date=March 2, 2000|accessdate=June 7, 2010[/tpl]
He spent time in rehab, where he was put on prescription medication, which he began to abuse.
In a 2004 interview published in The Sun, Haim said:
Haim wound up entering rehab fifteen times for his drug addiction, though despite reports, he did not suffer a drug induced stroke or fall into a coma according to Judy Haim. On August 10, 2001, Haim's mother found him unconscious at his Los Angeles bungalow.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cinema.com/news/item/5014/corey-haim-in-coma-after-drug-overdose.phtml |title=Corey Haim in coma after drug overdose |date=September 23, 2001 | publisher=Cinema.com |accessdate=April 20, 2010[/tpl] He was rushed to the UCLA Medical Center where doctors managed to stabilize him. Two weeks earlier, from July 23, 2001, Haim had spent some time in Sherman Oaks Hospital. He did not have health insurance, and was left gaunt and debilitated. Forced to foot the medical bills, he attempted to support himself by selling batches of his hair and an extracted molar on eBay.[tpl]cite web |url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b171029_remembering_corey_haim_from_lucas_lost.html |title=Remembering Corey Haim: From Lucas to Lost Boy |first=Joal |last=Ryan |publisher=E!

In 2001, Haim was the subject of an E! True Hollywood Story. Airing on October 17, it showed him living in a spartan apartment above a garage in Santa Monica with his mother. Haim was disoriented and unintelligible for some of his interviews. He was seen compiling a promotional clip reel for casting agents, and a pawnbroker recalled his begging for $3 to buy a slice of pizza. Feldman, himself now clean, spoke on the program about his attempts to help Haim kick the habit, and moved him into his house in October 2001.[tpl]cite news|title=The Lost Boy Grows Up: Child Star Stays Drunk |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/thelost_boy_child_star_grows_up_G1Of9Ta13FKqTidFZnXn4K |work=New York Post |date=October 17, 2001 |first=Adam |last=Buckman|accessdate=April 15, 2010[/tpl] Aged 29, Haim spent four days at Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch with Feldman.[tpl]cite news |title=Paying Homage to the King | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,529264,00.html |first=Greta |last=Van Susteren | date=October 29, 2009 |work=Fox News |accessdate=February 25, 2011[/tpl]
Feldman later said of Haim: "He made so many attempts at suicide. He's OD'd so many times. I mean, I can't begin to tell you, having him foaming at the mouth, coming downstairs and finding him that way and drooling and not able to speak, and me, having to put charcoal down his throat so that he could breathe."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.etonline.com/news/2010/03/84899/index.html |title=Corey Feldman on Corey Haim's death: I don't think it was suicide |first=Allison |last=Kugel |publisher=ET Online |accessdate=July 19, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Able to poke fun at himself, Haim made a cameo appearance in David Spade's Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, a film about a former child star, which included an array of actual former child stars, including Feldman. Haim also appeared in spoof horror movie The Back Lot Murders, alongside Priscilla Barnes.
In 2002, he guest-starred as himself in an episode of the Canadian television series Big Wolf on Campus.
He was the subject of a 2004 song by the Irish band, The Thrills, called "Whatever Happened to Corey Haim?". Haim answered the question: "For eight and a half years, I was just watching movies, and just staying in bed and just eating food and just, you know, being just miserable."[tpl]cite web |title=In His Own Words: Corey Haim Called Himself a 'Chronic Relapser' |first=Blane |last=Bachelor |coauthors=Oliver Jones |date=March 11, 2010 |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20350147,00.html |work=People |accessdate=March 24, 2010[/tpl]
Haim later spoke further on Larry King Live about his period out of the spotlight, stating that he did not leave his apartment for three and a half years, and ballooned to 302 pounds.

===Comeback and final years===

By 2004, Haim appeared to have overcome his drug habit after his mother persuaded him to return to Toronto with her and resettle there. In response to a "where are they now?" query, he said: "I'm clean, sober, humble and happy."
In 2006, he was ranked #8 on VH1's Greatest Teen Stars. In December that year, Haim began taping a reality show titled The Two Coreys, which reunited him with Feldman. Both were credited as executive producers, and had a measure of creative input. The show premiered on the A&E Network on July 29, 2007, with a second season starting on June 22, 2008. At its advent, Haim bought himself and Feldman matching Tiffany rings, "for our show, for life, for everything... matching actor-buddy rings."
The show's premise revolved around Haim living in Feldman's house with Feldman and Feldman's wife, while trying to get his career back on track.[tpl]cite web |title=About the Two Coreys |url=http://www.aetv.com/the-two-coreys/about/index.jsp |publisher=A&E Network |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=March 12, 2010[/tpl] The dynamics of the threesome were conceived in the style of the film You, Me and Dupree. Footage showed the ravages of Haim's habit on his body, and his appearance was unrecognizable from his younger self.[tpl]cite web |title=Remembering Corey Haim |date=July 10, 2007 |author=Mandi Bierly |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/03/10/corey-haim-memoriam/ |work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=March 29, 2010[/tpl] Although acknowledged as partially scripted, the show eventually took on a darker life of its own after Haim relapsed and his prescription drug abuse became apparent.
The disintegrating relationship between the former best friends prompted a six-month hiatus before the second season. Haim was nominated for a Viewer's Choice Award at the 22nd Annual Gemini Awards in Canada for his role in the show,[tpl]cite web |title='Lost Boys' Corey Haim Found Dead |url=http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-corey-haim-obit,0,7616140.story |publisher=KTLA |date=March 15, 2010 |accessdate=March 10, 2010[/tpl] and voted #8 in the category of "Favourite Canadian" on a TV Series (Not Eligible for a Gemini).[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] In 2007, Haim affirmed: "I want to be the guy they talk about when they talk about comebacks. I want people to learn from me, see I'm human, and understand that I make mistakes just like they do, but it doesn't have to consume you. You've got to walk through the raindrops, and that's what I'm trying to do."
In the first episode of the second season of The Two Coreys, Haim confronted Feldman, saying he had been sexually abused at the age of 14 by one of Feldman's acquaintances. Declining to identify his molester, a 42-year-old man, Haim claimed that a rape situation had continued for two years with Feldman's knowledge. He later stated: "I was very, very awake and very ashamed of what was going on, how I put it, I was just ... coming into Hollywood, man, just a horny little kid, like on drugs, getting fed drugs, man, by vampires." The unexpected confession led to a further rift between Haim and Feldman, and the now unscripted show continued to expose the darker side of their lives as teen stars.[tpl]cite web |title=The Lost Boys: Best Friends for Years, They Can't Stand Each Other Now.

On February 7, 2008, Haim ran a paid ad in the Hollywood trade publication Variety alongside a full-page photo, stating: "This is not a stunt. I'm back. I'm ready to work. I'm ready to make amends".[tpl]cite web |title=INSIDE STORY: Corey Haim's Slide from Lost Boy to Truly Lost |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20350268,00.html |first=Tom |last=Gliatto | date=March 10, 2010 |work=People |accessdate=March 10, 2010[/tpl]
In February 2008, filming commenced in Vancouver for Lost Boys: The Tribe, a direct-to-DVD sequel featuring few of the original cast. Haim wept when he was told on-camera that there was no role for him in the film. He was later scheduled to film a cameo appearance, but turned up on the set obviously under the influence and was unable to remember his lines.[tpl]cite web |title=Former Teen Stars Confront Corey Haim About Drug Use |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20216299,00.html |first=Katie |last=Coyne |date=August 1, 2008 |work=People |accessdate=March 23, 2010[/tpl] His scene only appeared during the closing credits.
Feldman avowed that he would no longer speak to Haim until he got clean. On The Two Coreys Feldman and his wife, along with two other former teen stars, called on Haim in an effort to get him to admit he needed help. "I don't feel that he's a safe person to have around my wife and child at the moment, for a multitude of reasons," Feldman said. Haim stated that he was currently clean and said, "I will always love Corey Feldman, but I lost 105 percent respect for him and his wife."
After the fallout, Haim had a car accident while under the influence during filming, and walked out for good on the show's psychiatrist.[tpl]cite web |title=Crashing Cars And Flushing Drugs: The Two Coreys Season Finale|url=http://www.defamer.com.au/tags/the-two-coreys/ |date=August 10, 2008 |publisher=Defamer |accessdate=March 23, 2010[/tpl] Publicly severing his ties with Haim, Feldman stated: "I am not going to watch him destroy himself."

Amid the duo's well-publicized estrangement came unconfirmed reports that Warner Bros. planned to release a Lost Boys 3—with their characters facing off.[tpl]cite web |title=Early Lost Boys 3 Talk |first=Clint |last=Morris |date=August 3, 2008 |url=http://www.moviehole.net/200814558-early-lost-boys-3-talk[/tpl] Feldman was confirmed to star in, and executive produce, Lost Boys: The Thirst.
In July 2008, Haim completed filming on the gambling comedy Shark City in Toronto with Vivica A. Fox, Carlo Rota and David Phillips. By late July, Haim had become destitute and homeless in Los Angeles. He was taken in by singer-songwriter G Tom Mac, who wrote "Cry Little Sister" for The Lost Boys soundtrack. They developed an idea for a reality show called Lost Boy Found, documenting Haim's addiction and recovery through music at Mac's studio, where he had been given a place to stay. Mac pledged that if Haim stayed clean, he would allow him to come on tour and perform with him. A pilot was filmed, in which Haim said: "I'm broke and I'm homeless and I didn't expect myself to be in this situation—ever."  On January 6, 2009, Haim and Mac did a two-hour internet radio interview to promote the show. At one point, Mac stated that he thought Haim was going to die from withdrawal complications that day, but he had stabilized. He also reported that there were cameras in the room with them.[tpl]Cite episode |title=BlogTalkRadio: Corey Haim and G Tom Mac|credits=Blockhead Rod, Corey Haim, G Tom Mac |network=BlogTalkRadio|airdate=January 07, 2009|minutes=24:03[/tpl] The show was not picked up.
In 2009, the actioner Crank: High Voltage was released, which saw Haim sporting a blond mullet alongside Jason Statham, Amy Smart and Dwight Yoakam. Haim completed two films scheduled for a 2010 release: the thriller American Sunset, in which he played a man who is abducted in the search for his missing wife,[tpl]cite web |title=Exclusive: Corey Haim talks about his final movie |first=Jacob |last=Burch |url=http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/2010/03/exclusive-corey-haim-talks-about-his-final-movie.html |date=March 18, 2010 |publisher=OnTheRedCarpet.com |accessdate=March 18, 2010[/tpl] and Decisions, shot in December 2009, in which his character is a cop working with troubled kids.
Haim was reportedly attached to several films scheduled to go into production in 2010. He was cast as a chemical engineer in SAD (Standard American Diet), an anti-FDA film about the food industry. Though he allegedly loved the script, plans to shoot a trailer with Haim in the fall of 2009 failed to materialize. Haim was set to star in the romantic comedy The Vegetarian Hunter as a hunter who becomes a vegetarian for the love of a woman, which planned to shoot in upstate New York. He was attached to play a murderer who mimics his father's killing sprees in the Louisiana-set slasher film The Pick-Up, and set to appear as a scavenger in a small town run by a deadly cult in the horror movie Ratred 3D. Haim was cast as a janitor in the comedy The Science Of Cool, which was in pre-production at the time of his death.
Haim was also slated to direct two films: The Throwaways, a political thriller following the fate of homeless people presumed to have vanished, and A Detour in Life, which he was set to both star in and direct. The film was described as a portrait of a man who sinks into alcoholism after his fiancée dies in a horse-riding accident, but who sobers up after rediscovering love with a teacher.

Haim's agent stated that the doctor was reluctant to drop Haim from his current level to zero pills, fearing a seizure, and took him to an addiction specialist to get mental help: "This guy prescribed Corey four prescriptions. I think it was five days prior to when Corey passed."
Dr. Drew Pinsky, addiction specialist and host of the reality show Celebrity Rehab, said of Haim: "Dozens, if not hundreds, of people reached out to me about their concerns about him." Attempts were made up until Haim's death to get him on the show. In his final days, Haim was working on The Dead Sea, a film in which mercenaries on a naval ship are trapped by zombies.

On March 10, 2010, after Haim's mother phoned 9-1-1, paramedics took Haim from their home to Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, where he was pronounced dead at 2:15 a.m. He was 38 years old. Los Angeles police stated that his death appeared to be an accidental overdose and that four bottles containing Valium, Vicodin, Soma (a muscle relaxant) and Haloperidol (an anti-psychotic) were retrieved,[tpl]cite news| title=Corey Haim's Pills: Vicodin, Valium, Haloperidol & More |date=March 11, 2010|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/11/corey-haims-pills-vicodin_n_495388.html|publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=April 21, 2010|first=Katy|last=Hall[/tpl] later confirmed as prescribed by a specialist, but that no illegal drugs were found at the scene.[tpl]cite web| title=Corey Haim's Reported Cause of Death: Pulmonary Congestion |first=Kate |last=McCarthy |coauthors=Michael Gammon and Dan Harris |date=March 11, 2010|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/corey-haims-reported-death-pulmonary-congestion/story?id=10077383&page=2 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=March 18, 2010[/tpl] It emerged that Haim had used aliases to procure 553 prescription pills in the 32 days prior to his death, having "doctor-shopped" seven different physicians and used seven pharmacies to obtain the supply, which included 195 Valium, 149 Vicodin, 194 Soma and 15 Xanax.[ref]

Haim had been ill with flu-like symptoms for two days before his death. A doctor called on him and took his temperature, but did not suspect serious problems. At one stage, Haim woke his mother and said, "Mom, can you please come and lie next to me, I'm not feeling very good."[tpl]cite news |first=Donna |last=McConnell |title=Corey was a good boy.

Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said: "As he got out of bed he felt a little weak and went down to the floor on his knees."
The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office ruled that Haim's death was due to pneumonia. Prior to the official autopsy reports being released publicly, Haim's mother stated that the coroner had given her a "courtesy call" to state his preliminary findings that Haim died of pulmonary edema and was suffering from an enlarged heart and water in the lungs.[tpl]cite web |title=Mom: Autopsy Finds Corey Haim Suffered Pulmonary Congestion |first=Brian |last=Orloff |date=March 11, 2010 |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20350898,00.html |work=People |accessdate=March 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Corey Haim's Personal Items Being Sold on Ebay |date=March 13, 2010 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2010/03/corey-haims-personal-items-being-sold-on-ebay.html |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=April 21, 2010[/tpl]

Feldman added that Haim had died "very destitute" and alone.
In 2011, Feldman told ABC's Nightline that "there's one person to blame in the death of Corey Haim, and that person happens to be a Hollywood mogul". He claimed that the sexual abuse of Haim had contributed to his early death.[tpl]cite news|journal=Nightline|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/feldman-corey-pedophilia-celebrity-hollywood-14277801|title= Corey Feldman Claims Pedophilia in Hollywood, Part 4: Actor claims he was "surrounded" by pedophilia as a child star|date=. 06:41 08/10/2011|publisher= ABC Nightline[/tpl]
California's Attorney General Jerry Brown announced that his office was investigating Haim's death, saying an unauthorized prescription in his name had been found amongst fraudulent prescription pads ordered from San Diego. On March 17, 2010, Brown announced that an arrest was made in connection with the investigation, which involved doctor identity theft and up to 5,000 illegal prescriptions. While detailed information was not released, officials stated that Haim had obtained Oxycontin via a prescription drug ring. Records showed he had received thousands of pills over the last year of his life, using physicians at offices, urgent-care facilities and emergency rooms.[tpl]cite news |title=Arrest linked to Corey Haim death |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/03/17/corey.haim.arrest/index.html |first=Alan |last=Duke |publisher=CNN |date=March 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 17, 2010[/tpl] On March 25, 2010, approximately twenty doctors were subpoenaed in connection with Haim's case.[tpl]cite news |title=Multiple doctors subpoenaed in Corey Haim drug ring controversy |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/dailydish/detail?blogid=7&entry_id=59929 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=March 25, 2010 |accessdate=March 26, 2010 | first=Laurie | last=Isola[/tpl] Haim claimed to each that he was not seeing any other doctors, and many reported feeling "duped" by him. The doctors told state agents that Haim complained of shoulder pain arising from an accident while shooting a film in Canada. Brown confirmed that Haim had obtained prescriptions for pain medication pertaining to multiple injuries and depression, using his pharmacy visits to solicit additional medication or ask for refills before due dates had expired. Brown called Haim the "poster child" for prescription drug addiction.
