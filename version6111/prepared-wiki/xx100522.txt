Saban of Baekje (?–?, r. 234) was the seventh king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.  He was the eldest son of the 6th king Gusu, of the Hae clan.
According to the Samguk Sagi, Saban was found too young to rule and was quickly succeeded{–}the Samguk Yusa says deposed{–}Il-yeon: Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea, translated by Tae-Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book Two, page 122. Silk Pagoda (2006). ISBN 1-59654-348-5 by King Goi, the younger brother of the 5th king Chogo. This is interpreted by scholars as a power struggle within the court, and the rise of the Jin clan over the Hae clan.
Nothing is known of the birth, later life, or death of Saban.  However, he is recorded in some Japanese chronicles, including Shinsen Shōjiroku, as the progenitor of certain clans of Yamato period Japan.  This may indicate that he spent the later part of his life in that country.
