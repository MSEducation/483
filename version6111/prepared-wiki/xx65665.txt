[[Foramen magnum]]

CATEGORIES: Foramina of the skull

In anatomy, the foramen magnum (Latin: "great hole") is a large opening in the occipital bone of the cranium.  It is one of the several oval or circular apertures in the base of the skull (the foramina), through which the medulla oblongata (an extension of the spinal cord) enters and exits the skull vault.
Apart from the transmission of the medulla oblongata and its membranes, the foramen magnum transmits the vertebral arteries, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, the membrana tectoria and alar ligaments. It also transmits the spinal component of the accessory nerve into the cranial fossa. 

==Importance==

In humans, the foramen magnum is farther underneath the head than in the other great apes. Thus, in humans, the neck muscles (including the occipitofrontalis muscle) do not need to be as robust in order to hold the head upright. Comparisons of the position of the foramen magnum in early hominid species are useful to determine how comfortable a particular species was when walking on two limbs (bipedalism) rather than four (quadrupedalism).
