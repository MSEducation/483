Titanic Symphony is Richard Kastle's third symphony and is based on the sinking of the RMS Titanic. It is a four movement piece for orchestra that starts out with the ship leaving the dock on her maiden voyage. It doesn't sink until the last movement. The rhythm of the sea was vital to the creation of the piece so he composed it on Venice Beach where he lived in the late 1980s.[ref]
