[[Dimension (vector space)]]

CATEGORIES: Linear algebra, Dimension, Vectors

In mathematics, the dimension of a vector space V is the cardinality (i.e. the number of vectors) of a basis of V.[tpl]cite book|author=Itzkov, Mikhail|title=Tensor Algebra and Tensor Analysis for Engineers: With Applications to Continuum Mechanics|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-3-540-93906-1|page=4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8FVk_KRY7zwC&pg=PA4[/tpl][tpl]efn|It is sometimes called Hamel dimension or algebraic dimension to distinguish it from other types of dimension.[/tpl]
For every vector space there exists a basis,[tpl]efn|if one assumes the axiom of choice[/tpl] and all bases of a vector space have equal cardinality;[tpl]efn|see dimension theorem for vector spaces[/tpl] as a result, the dimension of a vector space is uniquely defined. We say V is finite-dimensional if the dimension of V is finite.
The dimension of the vector space V over the field F can be written as dimF(V) or as : F, read "dimension of V over F". When F can be inferred from context, often just dim(V) is written.

==Examples==

The vector space R3 has 
as a basis, and therefore we have dimR(R3) = 3. More generally, dimR(Rn) = n, and even more generally, dimF(Fn) = n for any field F.
The complex numbers C are both a real and complex vector space; we have dimR(C) = 2 and dimC(C) = 1. So the dimension depends on the base field.
The only vector space with dimension 0 is {0}, the vector space consisting only of its zero element.

==Facts==

If W is a linear subspace of V, then dim(W) ≤ dim(V).
To show that two finite-dimensional vector spaces are equal, one often uses the following criterion: if V is a finite-dimensional vector space and W is a linear subspace of V with dim(W) = dim(V), then W = V.
Rn has the standard basis {e1, ..., en}, where ei is the i-th column of the corresponding identity matrix. Therefore Rn 
has dimension n.
Any two vector spaces over F having the same dimension are isomorphic. Any bijective map between their bases can be uniquely extended to a bijective linear map between the vector spaces. If B is some set, a vector space with dimension |B| over F can be constructed as follows: take the set F(B) of all functions f : B → F such that f(b) = 0 for all but finitely many b in B. These functions can be added and multiplied with elements of F, and we obtain the desired F-vector space. 
An important result about dimensions is given by the rank–nullity theorem for linear maps.
If F/K is a field extension, then F is in particular a vector space over K. Furthermore, every F-vector space V is also a K-vector space. The dimensions are related by the formula
In particular, every complex vector space of dimension n is a real vector space of dimension 2n.
Some simple formulae relate the dimension of a vector space with the cardinality of the base field and the cardinality of the space itself.
If V is a vector space over a field F then, denoting the dimension of V by dimV, we have:

==Generalizations==

One can see a vector space as a particular case of a matroid, and in the latter there is a well-defined notion of dimension. The length of a module and the rank of an abelian group both have several properties similar to the dimension of vector spaces.
The Krull dimension of a commutative ring, named after Wolfgang Krull (1899–1971), is defined to be the maximal number of strict inclusions in an increasing chain of prime ideals in the ring.

===Trace===

Alternatively, one may be able to take the trace of operators on an infinite-dimensional space; in this case a (finite) trace is defined, even though no (finite) dimension exists, and gives a notion of "dimension of the operator". These fall under the rubric of "trace class operators" on a Hilbert space, or more generally nuclear operators on a Banach space.
