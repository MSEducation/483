In physics, the electron volt (symbol eV; also written electronvoltIUPAC Gold Book, p. 75SI brochure, Sec. 4.1 Table 7) is a unit of energy equal to approximately [tpl]val|1.6|e=-19[/tpl] joule (symbol J). By definition, it is the amount of energy gained (or lost) by the charge of a single electron moved across an electric potential difference of one volt. Thus it is 1 volt (1 joule per coulomb, [tpl]val|fmt=commas|1|u=J/C[/tpl]) multiplied by the elementary charge (e, or [tpl]val|fmt=commas|1.602176565|(35)|e=-19|ul=C[/tpl]). Therefore, one electron volt is equal to [tpl]val|fmt=commas|1.602176565|(35)|e=-19|ul=J[/tpl].http://physics.nist.gov/constants  Historically, the electron volt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences because a particle with charge q has an energy [tpl]nowrap|1=E = qV[/tpl] after passing through the potential V; if q is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the terminal bias in volts, one gets an energy in eV.
