Lullaby for the Hearts of Space (1980) is an album by the American ambient musician Kevin Braheny.
Both pieces on the album were performed live using the Mighty Serge modular analog synthesizer and were spontaneous, improvised compositions. The first track, "Lullaby for the Hearts of Space", was originally recorded for a Hearts of Space radio special at KPFA-FM in March, 1980. The second track, "After I Said Goodnight," took inspiration from Emilie Conrad-Da'Oud's work Continuum and was created live during one of her classes.
Unlike Braheny's other albums, Lullaby for the Hearts of Space was never released on compact disc, reportedly because Braheny was not fond of the results.  Braheny asked Hearts of Space to not release additional copies after the existing copies had sold out and the request was granted. As a result, the album is difficult to find. The recording is being remastered by Braheny Fortune, and has an indefinite re-release date.http://www.kevinbrahenyfortune.com/music/discography.html
