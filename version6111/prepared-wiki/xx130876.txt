In the 2000 Olympics Bindra achieved a score of 590, placing him 11th in the qualification round, meaning he did not qualify for the finals since only the top eight competed in the finals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/2000/sep/18bindra.htm|publisher=Rediff|date=18 September 2000|accessdate=11 August 2008|title=China grabs gold, Bindra places 11th in shooting| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080902023405/http://www.rediff.com/sports/2000/sep/18bindra.htm| archivedate= 2 September 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] After his disappointing performance, Bindra said that he had no plans to retire from shooting.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/article3703293.ece|title= Bindra has no plans to retire| date= 30 July 2012 | location=Chennai, India| work=The Hindu[/tpl]

===Notable international performance===

After these successes he started suffering from a severe back injury, so much so that he was unable to compete or even lift a rifle for a year, upsetting his preparations for the Beijing Games. However, Bindra put all speculation to rest, bringing India perhaps her biggest sporting glory ever[tpl]citation needed|date = March 2014[/tpl]. Bindra booked his place in the 2008 Olympics by winning the gold medal at the 2006 ISSF World Shooting Championships with a score of 699.1.[tpl]cite web|title=Abhinav Bindra clinches India's first gold|work=The Hindu |location=India |date=25 July 2006|accessdate=11 August 2008|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2006/07/25/stories/2006072507132000.htm| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080814001954/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2006/07/25/stories/2006072507132000.htm| archivedate= 14 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
This was India's first individual gold medal at the Olympics, and the first gold in 28 years, since the men's field hockey team won the gold at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Bindra was rewarded by various Indian state governments and private organisations for his achievement.
Abhinav Bindra won the Gold medal in the Men's 10-metre Air rifle event at the 12th Asian Shooting Championships, which was held in Doha Qatar.
Abhinav Bindra lost in the qualification round in 2012 London Olympics finishing with a score of 594 placing him in 16th, though his compatriot Gagan Narang made it to the finals in 3rd place, and went on to win the bronze medal for India, thereby opening the medal tally for India in London Olympics 2012.
