==Description==

The codex contains the text of the four Gospels, on 264 parchment leaves (size [tpl]×|17.7|13.6[/tpl]), with lacunae at the end (John 19:25-21:1). The text is written in one column per page, 24 lines per page. It is neatly written. There are breathings and accents used correctly. The iota subscriptum is rare.Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener, Adversaria Critica Sacra: With a Short Explanatory Introduction (Cambridge, 1893), p. XLIX. The nomina sacra are written in an abbreviated forms.
According tο Scrivener Movable nu occurs only seven times, a hiatus for the lack of it thrice. There are not many itacistic errors, except ο for ω.
The text is divided according to the [tpl]lang|grc|κεφαλαια[/tpl] (chapters), whose numbers are given at the margin, and their [tpl]lang|grc|τιτλοι[/tpl] (titles) in red at the top and foot of the pages. There is also a division according to the smaller Ammonian Sections (in Mark 232 Sections, the last section in 16:6) stand at the margin, with references to the Eusebian Canons under them (very partially). There are also Verses (the smallest sections).
It contains Prolegomena, lists of the [tpl]lang|grc|κεφαλαια[/tpl] (tables of contents) before each Gospel (three of them in red). The Church lessons stand also at the margin in red. It has incipits, Synaxarion, Menologion, subscriptions at the end of each Gospel, and portraits of the four Evangelists (before each Gospel).[ref]

The text of Luke 22:43-44 and the Pericope Adulterae are omitted.
