</ref> When Charteris decided to launch an ongoing series of stories featuring his [[Robin Hood]]-inspired anti-hero, Simon Templar (a.k.a. The Saint) in late 1929, he imported the character of Teal though it's not known if ''Daredevil'' plays any role in the actual continuity of the Saint series. (The first Saint story, 1928's ''[[Meet - The Tiger!]]'', predated ''Daredevil'' and featured a character named Detective Carn, who was a template for the later Teal).<ref>

Teal first appeared opposite Simon Templar in several novella-length stories that appeared in the UK magazine Thriller in the spring and summer of 1929; several were published in 1930 as the collection Enter the Saint (which is where most readers were first exposed to Teal),[ref]
