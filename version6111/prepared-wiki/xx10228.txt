Raven Software (or Raven Entertainment Software, Inc.) is an American video game developing company based in Wisconsin and founded in 1990. In 1997, Raven made an exclusive publishing deal with Activision and was subsequently acquired by them. After the acquisition, much of the studio's original developers, largely responsible for creating the Heretic and Hexen: Beyond Heretic games, left to form Human Head Studios.

==History==

Raven Software was founded in 1990 by brothers Brian and Steve Raffel. The company was independent until 1997 when it looked for a buyer; eventually being bought by Activision due to their happiness to leave the studio relatively untouched. When Raven Software were acquired they lost many employees unhappy with the acquisition.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.edge-online.com/features/lessons-learned-raven-software/ |title= Lessons Learned from Raven Software |date= 20 February 2009 |accessdate= 1 December 2013 |work= Edge[/tpl]
Raven has a history of working with id Software: After using id's engines for many of their games (from Heretic in 1994), they took over development of id's Quake franchise for Quake 4 and the new iteration of id's Wolfenstein series.[tpl]cite web |url=http://investor.activision.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=175541 |title=id Software and Activision, Inc.

The company started off with three development teams, cut to two from the major layoffs, of 30-35 staff, which occurred in August 2009 following the poor performance and possible over-budget of Wolfenstein.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/raven-software-hit-layoffs|title=Raven Software Hit By Layoffs|first=Tom|last=Ivan[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5346302/raven-hit-by-layoffs-some-point-to-lackluster-wolfenstein-sales |title= Raven Hit By Layoffs, Some Point to Lackluster Wolfenstein Sales |date= 26 August 2009 |accessdate= 1 December 2013 |first= Brian |last= Crecente |work= Kotaku[/tpl] The amount of teams reduced to one as a result of more layoffs in October 2010 after delays with Singularity in which as many as 40 staff were released.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/raven-software-loses-staff|title=Raven Software loses more staff[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5661071/singularity-game-developer-hit-with-layoffs |title= Singularity Game Developer Hit with Layoffs |date= 11 October 2010 |accessdate= 1 December 2013 |first= Brian |last= Crecente |work= Kotaku[/tpl]
